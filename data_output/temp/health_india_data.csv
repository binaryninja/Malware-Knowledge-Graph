Digital Health 
Ecosystem in India 
Lav Agarwal
Technology now permeates every facet of human existence. From 
communication and transportation to healthcare and entertainment, 
technology has redefined how we live, work, and interact. Its omnipresence 
is reshaping societal norms, revolutionising various sectors, and propelling 
us into the future.
Through improvements in diagnostics, treatment, and patient care, 
technological advancements have had a profound impact on healthcare. 
Medical devices, telemedicine, electronic health records, and artificial 
intelligence (AI)-driven diagnostics have transformed healthcare delivery by 
making it more precise, efficient, and accessible. Wearable devices and health 
apps have empowered individuals to monitor and manage their well-being 
proactively. Technology has also played a crucial role in advancing medical"|data/MedicalDocuments/India/BuildingResilientDigitalHealthIndia.pdf|0|13476c1867c9495c84d01303b9f5222a

"83Building a Resilient Digital Health Ecosystem in India Digital Health Landscape in India
Given India’s massive population, providing equitable access to healthcare 
services to all is an important agenda. By harnessing the power of 
technology, digital health can effectively address these challenges and 
ensure that healthcare services are accessible even in the remote regions. 
Patients can use digital platforms for convenient access to care. Digital 
platforms therefore bridge gaps and improve healthcare delivery across the 
nation.
In line with the ‘Digital India’ initiative and the vision to create 
interoperable and standardised electronic health records across the country, 
the Indian government  notified the Electronic Health Record1 standards in 
2016. The National Health Policy2 (2017) envisages the creation of a digital 
health technology ecosystem  that serves the needs of all stakeholders and 
improves efficiency, transparency, and citizens’ experiences across public"|data/MedicalDocuments/India/BuildingResilientDigitalHealthIndia.pdf|1|b179a090fb084d6ea17fee9439a110d1
"and private healthcare.
Over the recent years, India has made progress in digital healthcare 
delivery, as demonstrated in national health programmes such as the 
Hospital Management Information System, Online Registration System, the 
national tuberculosis elimination (Ni-kshay) programme, Mother and Child 
Tracking System, Mera Aspataal  (My Hospital, a patient feedback system), the 
Health Management Information System, the Integrated Health Information 
Platform, and Non-Communicable Diseases screening application—which 
have benefitted patients through the timely delivery of services and  by 
making government healthcare more affordable and accessible.3
The need for a future-ready digital health system has become even more 
urgent with the announcement of the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan 
Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY)4 in 2018, India’s flagship programme that would 
herald an infrastructural transformation of the nation’s health system. This 
mission envisions the following:"|data/MedicalDocuments/India/BuildingResilientDigitalHealthIndia.pdf|1|bf384699b63a44e9a6429a506dfb961e

85II. Providing financial protection of up to INR 500,000 per family annually 
for secondary and tertiary care hospitalisation to the over 120 million 
crore poor and vulnerable families that comprise the bottom 40 percent 
of the Indian population.
These initiatives aim to scale up a wellness-oriented approach instead 
of an illness-focused one—a key step towards achieving universal health 
coverage (UHC) through patient data portability across primary, secondary, 
and tertiary levels. This essentially translates into an environment where 
all people can obtain health services anywhere in the country without 
suffering financial hardship or excessive indirect costs. 
Achieving such scale requires us to rethink the core technology backbone 
of our system and leverage cutting-edge digital solutions to tackle the 
challenge. However, it is also felt that all these efforts need to converge into"|data/MedicalDocuments/India/BuildingResilientDigitalHealthIndia.pdf|2|d75ac3dcfd744c7b963a9b4c90fbd9d9
"a single framework to achieve interoperability of data, which would benefit 
both policymakers for decision-making and patients with effective services 
at the time of need. In response, the government developed the National 
Digital Health Blueprint as a framework for the efficient implementation of 
digital health treatments.
The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission5
To implement the principles of the blueprint, the National Digital Health 
Mission, now known as the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM), was 
launched in six union territories in August 2020.  It was proposed to be 
carried out via six key components—i.e, the digital health ID card, Digi-
Doctor, Health Facility Registry, Personal Health Records, e-pharmacy, and 
telemedicine. India launched the nationwide implementation the ABDM in 
September 2021 . The ABDM intends to create the framework needed to 
enable an integrated digital health infrastructure in India. Additionally, it"|data/MedicalDocuments/India/BuildingResilientDigitalHealthIndia.pdf|2|31edc3e999ac4bc8a24b5aed3c81d49d

As of July  2023, over 435 million ABHAa numbers have been created, and 
214,396 health facilities and 207,274 doctors have been registered under 
the ABDM ecosystem.
ABDM has accelerated the participation of various stakeholders of the 
healthcare ecosystem and ensured deployment of patient-centric policies—
resulting in cashless care with improved access to ensure protection 
for the poor. Given its federal and complex healthcare structure, India 
demands agility, flexibility and evidence-based smart policymaking for 
implementation of healthcare initiatives, driving all stakeholders towards 
health-seeking behaviours with renewed energy. 
Digital Health in COVID-19 Management
The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged health systems across the globe. 
The India government not only focused on the management of the pandemic"|data/MedicalDocuments/India/BuildingResilientDigitalHealthIndia.pdf|3|563b45ecd7d447c089670da47fd6f9ec

the continuity of health services across the spectrum. It has followed a 
‘whole of government, whole of society’ approach to battle the pandemic 
by engaging subnational and local governments, civil society organisations, 
the private sector, and local communities in mitigation efforts.
Amid the pandemic, India recognised the need to ease access to digital 
consultations, and issued the Telemedicine Practice Guidelines in March 
2020. India also launched eSanjeevaniOPD,6 a first of its kind and the 
world’s largest national telemedicine service to facilitate online health 
facilities to patients in the confines of their home at no cost to ensure

87India developed another state-of-the-art digital health system, CoWIN,7 a 
digital platform that helped more than a billion beneficiaries book COVID-19 
vaccinations in less than three months. In less than 18 months, CoWIN 
had helped administer two billion COVID-19 vaccination doses, immunising 
over 90 percent of all eligible adults.
The establishment of digitally-enabled COVID-19 ‘war rooms’ at the central 
and state levels allowed key stakeholders to undertake data-driven decisions 
towards infrastructure gap analysis, case projection and management, and 
to identify problem areas that required specific state-centre coordination. 
Various other digital health initiatives that have enhanced India’s efforts 
against the COVID-19 crisis are outlined in the following points: 
i. the   COVID-19 India Portal developed for disease tracking by geography,"|data/MedicalDocuments/India/BuildingResilientDigitalHealthIndia.pdf|4|60df57d856f447b7950656fe9dbe5ae5

"87Building a Resilient Digital Health Ecosystem in India Leveraging AI for Improved Healthcare
Across the world, AI is being used in healthcare to support doctors and 
healthcare workers, improve customer service and patient management, and 
monitor diseases. The Indian government has established three centres of 
excellence for AI—at the All India Institutes of Medical Sciences in Delhi 
and Rishikesh, and at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & 
Research in Chandigarh—to leverage and identify potential areas for the 
use of AI in the health sector. The centres are already working on several 
solutions for healthcare which leverage generative AI, including:
i. a clinical decision support system, a multilingual solution to provide 
diagnostic and triaging support to doctors; 
ii. event-based disease surveillance to scan large volumes of digital media 
in English as well as 10 Indian languages to monitor events that signal

The inclusive capacity building of health professionals is an important 
component to ensure the efficient delivery of healthcare services across 
the country. Tele-education has benefitted all fields of education including 
medical education, especially for students in remote areas with limited access 
to schools and qualified teachers. Online platforms, video conferencing, 
and pre-recorded lectures have facilitated learning for students who were 
previously deprived of quality education due to their geographical location.
Keeping this vision in mind, the government has developed a unified and 
dedicated online learning and training platform, SAKSHAM,8 to enable"|data/MedicalDocuments/India/BuildingResilientDigitalHealthIndia.pdf|5|aa8d6614bfc94397897f73b56ab9c6ca

89With such developments in digital health, India has leapfrogged in terms 
of the adoption of digital health in the public sector. This will arguably 
lead to the creation of a national digital health ecosystem through wide-
scale adoption of digital tools across the continuum of care, both in the 
private and public sectors.
Promoting the Digital Health Agenda Globally
India has emerged as a frontrunner in championing digital health and 
in positioning it as a critical agenda at the global level. Recognising 
the transformative potential of technology in healthcare, India has 
taken proactive steps to harness digital innovations, promote healthcare 
accessibility, and drive advancements in the field globally.

highlighted global attention to the potential challenges and opportunities 
related to digital health technology and need for close collaboration on the 
issue globally. As a follow-up action, WHO has prioritised digital health 
agenda by establishing the Department for Digital Health and Innovation in 
April 2019 and published the Global Strategy on Digital Health 2020-2025  to 
promote healthy lives and well-being for all. 
India served as Chair of the Global Digital Health Partnership (GDHP, 
between 2019 and 2021), which is the world’s largest intergovernmental 
and multilateral forum on the issue of digital health. Under India’s

Sameer Kanwar and Varun Kumar
In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, many countries are 
striving to establish and strengthen digital public infrastructure (DPI) 
to harness the transformative power of technology to benefit citizens. India 
has emerged as a noteworthy example by successfully using technological 
advancements to create robust DPI. It has implemented various initiatives 
that mobilise technology for inclusive growth, economic development, and 
improved governance. Countries around the world can learn from India’s 
experience and achievements to initiate similar digital transformations.
Through the Digital India programme, India is seeking to digitally equip 
citizens with access to all government services by improving internet 
connectivity and developing online infrastructure. This encompasses three 
key areas: (a) establishing a secure digital infrastructure; (b) successfully"|data/MedicalDocuments/India/LessonsIndiaDigitalHealthTfn.pdf|0|1b372b2c96bf4cf5be87c9ecf6535941

to the internet. India has also seen an increase in the number of digital 
technology users, with an estimated 750 million smartphone users,  and a 
projected one billion users by 2025.1 This increase has generated demand 
for a centralised digital architecture that functions as a single enterprise."|data/MedicalDocuments/India/LessonsIndiaDigitalHealthTfn.pdf|0|6fc85b4fdeef43289abba22a98b48bd1

93In 2018, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) 
created the India Enterprise Architecture (IndEA) framework1 for the adoption 
of a whole-of-government enterprise architecture by central ministries, 
state departments, and public sector enterprises. Built with a focus on 
performance, IndEA offers open standards to promote interoperability 
and supports decentralisation. At the same time, it supports both new 
(greenfield) and legacy (brownfield) e-governance initiatives. The emphasis 
of the IndEA initiative is to enable “One Government – a government 
that is least visible but is effective” by implementing the concept of 
“virtualisation of departments” to activate synergy.2

roles, accountability, and change management. This encompasses various 
components, including digital identification systems, digital payments 
systems, and digital service delivery platforms. 
Pillars of Digital Public Infrastructure in India
The foundation: Aadhaar5
India's Aadhaar programme, a biometric and face authentication-based 
digital identification system, has revolutionised identity verification 
and service delivery in the country. Aadhaar has provided a unique 
identification number to over 1.3 billion residents of India, enabling access 
to essential services such as government subsidies, bank accounts, and 
mobile connections. It has enabled the government to streamline service 
delivery and eliminate duplication by providing a single digital identity

has facilitated interoperability across service delivery platforms, both public 
and private.
Driving financial inclusion: Unified Payments Interface6
India's push to digitise payments has transformed the way financial 
transactions are conducted in the country. The implementation of UPI has 
created a platform that enables instant money transfers between bank 
accounts. It offers a smartphone-based interface to support seamless, 
interoperable, and real-time payments, available on the go. UPI has not only 
transformed the way individuals transact but has also provided a significant 
boost to the growth of the digital economy. Countries can gather important 
lessons from India's experience in fostering a competitive and interoperable 
payment ecosystem, which has led to increased financial inclusion, reduced 
reliance on cash, and enhanced transparency in transactions."|data/MedicalDocuments/India/LessonsIndiaDigitalHealthTfn.pdf|2|323abf2e2dd640b68025a5e6b9346734

payments, as compared to 18.5 billion in China and 8.7 billion in Brazil.9 
This is indicative of the ease with which the Indian population has adopted 
digital platforms for making payments even if the average value of such 
payments may be rather low.
Efficient welfare delivery: Direct Benefit Transfer10
India's Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) programme is aimed at eliminating 
potential leakages in the physical delivery of financial benefits and ensuring 
an efficient transfer of welfare to the right beneficiaries. By leveraging 
digital payment systems, benefits are directly credited to the beneficiaries’ 
bank accounts, reducing corruption, eliminating middlemen, and improving"|data/MedicalDocuments/India/LessonsIndiaDigitalHealthTfn.pdf|3|b9fc627dc58a4940915aefe392262ca3

and union territories. More than INR 24,800 billion has been transferred 
through the DBT programme since 2013, with INR 6,300 billion transferred 
in FY 2021-22 alone. On average, more than 9 million DBT payments were 
processed daily in FY 2021-22.12 
Citizen-centric services: E-governance13
India has leveraged technology to enhance governance and service delivery

India’s achievements in implementing DPI demonstrate the transformative 
power of technology when combined with inclusivity, scalability, regulation, 
and collaboration. The key factors that equipped the country to achieve this 
digital revolution include:"|data/MedicalDocuments/India/LessonsIndiaDigitalHealthTfn.pdf|4|4346c415761a400bbd13738d2880dc1d
"97Lessons from India’s Digital Public Infrastructure Transformation Ecosystem collaboration
India's success in digital service delivery can be attributed to strong 
collaboration between government agencies, industry leaders, startups, 
academia, and civil society organisations. This collaborative approach 
has fostered innovation, shared expertise, and effective implementation. 
India’s G20 presidency has further drawn attention to the importance 
of collaboration, with initiatives like the Global DPI Summit21 allowing 
a close agreement between partners (and non-partners alike) on the 
common principles and design aspects of DPIs. By bringing together all the 
stakeholders, the Indian government has created a collaborative environment 
for developing and implementing digital public infrastructure projects.
Industry players have contributed their expertise, resources, and technological 
innovations to build and maintain the required infrastructure. Similarly,"|data/MedicalDocuments/India/LessonsIndiaDigitalHealthTfn.pdf|5|72341765203b43498a676b032bedf44c
"collaborations with academic institutions and research organisations have 
aided innovation and helped address technical and policy challenges. Public-
private partnerships and international collaborations have further supported 
knowledge exchange, best practice sharing, and access to resources and 
funding.
The Indian government has been able to promote such an ecosystem 
collaboration by establishing platforms (such as, India Stack), forums (for 
example, India Stack Knowledge Exchange Forum, 202222), and regulatory 
frameworks (IndEA and DEPA) that encourage active participation, 
information sharing, and coordination between different stakeholders. 
These collaborations prioritise interoperability, data privacy, security, and 
scalability to build a robust and sustainable DPI in the country.

99including marginalised communities, India has achieved a notable level of 
inclusivity. While there are gaps in digital inclusion across demographic 
locations (55 percent share of urban telephone subscribers, as of December 
202224) and gender (11 percent gender gap in mobile ownership, 202325), 
the country is consistently invested in closing this difference.
India’s digital infrastructure has been created keeping in mind future 
needs and potential growth. With a quantum increase in users connected 
to the internet, the emergence of multiple types of intermediaries (digital 
media, e-commerce, and others), and the possible use of connectivity to 
cause harm or commit crimes cannot be ignored. Comprehensive measures 
need to be taken to prepare for the future. To check a potential DPI’s 
scalability even before introduction, significant emphasis has been placed"|data/MedicalDocuments/India/LessonsIndiaDigitalHealthTfn.pdf|6|c4df77774a1644f7854fce36f38dd1c9
"on considerations like robust technology frameworks, interoperability, open 
Application Programming Interfaces, data management, and addressing 
infrastructure gaps. 
India’s journey is an example of how scalability and inclusion work 
together in building a resilient and equitable digital public infrastructure. 
Key strategies that have helped the country’s efforts to establish its 
infrastructure at scale are ensuring accessibility, promoting digital literacy 
and skill development, focus on last-mile connectivity, multilingual support 
in technological solutions, participatory implementation, and regulations to 
ensure affordability.
Balancing regulation and innovation
India's digital payments ecosystem demonstrates the need to strike a 
balance between regulation and innovation. While fostering competition and 
innovation, the country has implemented robust regulatory measures to 
ensure the security and integrity of transactions."|data/MedicalDocuments/India/LessonsIndiaDigitalHealthTfn.pdf|6|8b202115529b413e805052339024fb38
