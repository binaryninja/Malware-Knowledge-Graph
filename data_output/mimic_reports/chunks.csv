"Past Cyber Operations Against Ukraine and What May Be Next crowdstrike.com/blog/lessons-from-past-cyber-operations-against-ukraine/ CrowdStrike Intelligence Team

January 28, 2022

Disruptive and destructive cyber operations have been levied against elements of Ukrainian society by adversaries attributed to the Russian government — or groups highly likely to be controlled by them — since at least 2014. These operations have impacted several sectors, including energy, transportation and state finance, and have attempted to influence political processes and affect businesses more broadly within the country. These operations have been conducted in a semi-deniable manner, providing enough evidence to arouse suspicion of the likely perpetrators — so as to ensure that intended messaging is conveyed to targeted entities — while also obfuscating the activity’s origins. CrowdStrike attributes the majority of the known offensive operations against Ukraine to VOODOO BEAR, an adversary highly likely controlled by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (GRU). The impact of offensive operations is rarely constrained to the initial target entity, with collateral damage occurring either directly through corruption of computer networks or indirectly through interruption of critical business services on which organizations rely for

Detail Techniques employed by VOODOO BEAR to facilitate and deliver destructive effects have evolved over the years, from the distribution of targeted wiper malware via custom loaders to mimicking the effect of ransomware deployments using wider-reaching distribution mechanisms such as supply chain and strategic web compromises (SWC). However, the pretense of ransomware is often superficial and its implementation is not consistent with financially motivated criminal actors. There is also evidence to suggest that the adversary has leveraged attribution fronts claiming to be motivated by hacktivist ideologies alongside destructive campaigns, likely in an attempt to amplify the effects of the attacks by publicizing them more widely. CrowdStrike Intelligence has reported extensively on VOODOO BEAR operations within Ukraine, with overviews of their evolving operations available to our premium intelligence subscribers. These campaigns are assessed to likely contribute to psychological operations seeking to degrade, delegitimize or otherwise influence public trust in state institutions and industry sectors in the country.|data_input/mimic_reports/entry_0401fcd9-77df-4f27-9bd1-66b57cf4f2bf.text|db2b7402873749a3b349846574412d3f
"2014-2016: Targeted Attacks Using Custom Delivery Malware Early destructive operations attributed to VOODOO BEAR have targeted a range of sectors within Ukraine, often leveraging a combination of the BlackEnergy malware (version 3) and the KillDisk (aka PassKillDisk) wiper. Many campaigns were timed to coincide with specific events or seasons, while the events in December 2016 could be interpreted as a persistent execution of successive attacks designed to have a multiplicative disruptive effect on the country. These operations included: May 2014: targeting of energy and transportation organizations October 2015: targeting of media outlets, coinciding with local elections December 2015: targeting of an energy provider in western Ukraine December 2016: targeting of state-operated financial institutions (FIs) and rail companies December 2016: targeting of an energy provider causing power outages in Kiev December 2016: targeting of the Ukrainian State Hydrographic Service

Despite the relatively focused targeting in each of these cases, variants of the KillDisk malware distributed in December 2016 were modified to mimic ransomware and hacktivist intent, foreshadowing later developments in operational tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs). Observations of contemporary activity in this period suggest that attribution fronts adopting hacktivist personas were used to publicly release data from Ukrainian organizations alongside these offensive operations, although the exact nature of their coordination is unclear. For example, the CyberBerkut collective claimed responsibility for destructive and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks against the Ukrainian Central Election Commission (CEC) in May 2014, after which the group began publishing sensitive emails and internal documents from the CEC to support their claim. Similarly, in December 2016, a pro-Russia hacktivist group called Sprut leaked a series of documents related to the finances of the Ukrainian government’s state energy company. Later that month, the group announced they had disrupted the main website of the Ukrainian Energy company Ukrenergo, which had publicly acknowledged that internal systems had been accessed on Dec. 17-18, 2016. Information operations (IO) combining public (disruptive) and non-public (destructive) intent are highly likely representative of attempts to amplify the effects of damage to government systems by controlling public narrative over an extended period."|data_input/mimic_reports/entry_0401fcd9-77df-4f27-9bd1-66b57cf4f2bf.text|1fa93f531a334f529daf2f48cb6f5888
"2016-2017: Increased Deniability and Scale Through the Use of PseudoRansomware VOODOO BEAR’s destructive operations in 2017 marked a distinct change in deployment and destructive payload TTPs. Building on earlier attempts to masquerade wipers as criminal ransomware, several campaigns using different — but technically linked — pseudoransomware families were deployed by the adversary against Ukrainian entities. Of particular note was the adoption of several deployment techniques that greatly amplified the potential scope and destructive implications of these operations. The use of supply chain compromise and SWC methodologies vastly increased the number of victims impacted by each campaign, and worm-like propagation mechanisms supported by the Mimikatz credential-stealing tool and the EternalBlue exploit for the CVE-2017-0144 vulnerability increased the potential impact on networks after initial infection. These operations included: January 2017: Filecoder.NKH was deployed via a supply chain compromise of a Ukrainian IT company May 2017: XDATA was deployed for a short period via the software update mechanism of M.E. Doc, a Ukrainian accounting software product used by many companies either located — or operating — within Ukraine

June 2017: FakeCry also was deployed via a malicious M.E. Doc update, a malware family impersonating the infamous WannaCry ransomware June 2017: NotPetya was deployed via the same M.E. Doc mechanism, with earlier tests likely deployed via SWC of a Ukrainian media website October 2017: BadRabbit was deployed against Ukrainian transport networks via SWC of websites in several countries including Ukraine, Russia, Turkey and Bulgaria Observations of a phased approach to the distribution of pseudo-ransomware variants across multiple delivery vectors suggest that campaigns in early 2017 may have been tests for the wider distribution of NotPetya, which was apparently timed to coincide with Ukraine’s Constitution Day. However, distribution of NotPetya via the M.E. Doc update mechanism — also used by non-Ukrainian organizations — and the implementation of unconstrained propagation techniques resulted in global spread with likely unintended impact to a wide variety of sectors including logistics, healthcare and retail. The BadRabbit campaign also appeared to have resulted in collateral damage against some Russia-based organizations, likely as a result of victims visiting websites used to distribute the malware."|data_input/mimic_reports/entry_0401fcd9-77df-4f27-9bd1-66b57cf4f2bf.text|83db44f5a5574f42bf3b1b2b25da33bf
"2022: Hybrid Operations Using Multiple Campaign Stages January 2022 reporting on what CrowdStrike tracks as the WhisperedDebate activity cluster involving website defacements and WhisperGate wiper operations against Ukrainian government networks demonstrates the continued intent to disrupt state institutions. CrowdStrike Intelligence does not currently attribute WhisperedDebate to a named adversary (e.g., VOODOO BEAR), although high-level parallels to previous operations, the Ukrainian focus and timing of the activity strongly suggest a Russia-nexus adversary or a group aligned with their interests. Public statements from the Ukrainian government suggest that the scope of this operation was relatively constrained compared to VOODOO BEAR campaigns in 2017, although it is unknown whether this was intentional or representative of operational difficulties experienced by the adversary. However, the likely manual malware distribution vector employed and the focus on targeting of government networks — and other destructive attacks against IT service providers, likely in an attempt to cover up evidence of initial intrusion vectors — indicates that limited impact was intentional in this case. CrowdStrike has identified several attempts to distribute data purportedly acquired from several government organizations shortly after they had been targeted during the WhisperedDebate campaign, supporting claims made in the website defacement messages.

Ukrainian officials that no data had been taken during the network intrusions. These attempts can seek to degrade public trust in the government’s ability to effectively address the breaches. This use of IO mirrors earlier VOODOO BEAR TTPs, where the CyberBerkut and Sprut group personas contemporaneously released private data from Ukrainian organizations. The introduction of publicly visible website defacements during the WhisperedDebate activity provides an additional facet to the operation that can be easily picked up and amplified by media outlets."|data_input/mimic_reports/entry_0401fcd9-77df-4f27-9bd1-66b57cf4f2bf.text|47673901af0a49b781e726a11fde13a8
Assessment The extended history of destructive VOODOO BEAR operations against Ukrainian entities indicates a commitment to the execution of psychological operations against the local populace. This represents ongoing Russian government efforts to influence Ukraine against a backdrop of national security and populist policies. Ultimately, these operations and their intended effects are complementary to the Russian government’s overall strategy pertaining to Ukraine, although they do not appear to be specifically linked to overt diplomatic efforts or military maneuvers, and instead are likely intended as a separate tool that can be used to selectively increase tension within Ukraine and destabilize public trust in Ukrainian government institutions. The precise endgame for these actions is unclear, although coercing the population to reject closer ties with the West, establishing new leadership more favorable to Russia or preparing for military action similar to the 2014 annexation of Crimea are all possible intended outcomes. CrowdStrike anticipates that future offensive operations against Ukraine will most likely take the form of destructive wiping attacks masquerading as ransomware. This assessment is made with moderate confidence, based on a successive evolution of technical TTPs and the acknowledgement that this type of operation can have the desired disruptive effect and signal deeper intent, while still avoiding taking direct responsibility for the attacks.|data_input/mimic_reports/entry_0401fcd9-77df-4f27-9bd1-66b57cf4f2bf.text|417f433450a64a37afab91c15dec1490
The contemporaneous use of IO campaigns to launder and publicize PII or other sensitive data stolen during network breaches and draw media awareness through website defacement activity is also likely to occur as part of hybrid operations in the future. A low chance of DoS attacks may be present in future campaigns, although this technique has not been observed in recent years and arguably has little lasting effect on targeted organizations. DoS would most likely be used in combination with other offensive actions such as wiping attacks, or to bolster credentials within hacktivist communities. Based on observations of past events such as the spread of NotPetya, disruptive and destructive attacks against Ukraine are likely to have broader implications, including potential impacts to organizations based outside the country. Collateral damage is particularly likely to be experienced by companies that operate subsidiaries within Ukraine or possess network 5/6|data_input/mimic_reports/entry_0401fcd9-77df-4f27-9bd1-66b57cf4f2bf.text|8ecb1cee5d7148ef98f64be8f2a07b0d
assets interconnected with Ukrainian organizations. This assessment is made with moderate confidence, although there is evidence to suggest that subsequent operations have attempted to limit the scope of unconstrained malware propagation, likely due to the significant unintended fallout of NotPetya. Outside of being directly impacted by destructive attacks, organizations relying on Ukrainian logistics networks are likely to experience disruptive effects of any future operations targeting part of the Ukrainian transport sector. Destructive attacks intentionally targeted at organizations outside the country — such as those headquartered within countries supportive of Ukraine’s position against Russia, including the U.S. and those in Europe — cannot be completely discounted, although this is assessed as an unlikely scenario due to the risk of uncontrolled escalation of international tension and punitive measures, including direct retaliatory actions by other governments. However, the incidental targeting of international businesses operating within Ukraine may be used by Russian-nexus adversaries to dissuade business operations and investment and destabilize the local economy.|data_input/mimic_reports/entry_0401fcd9-77df-4f27-9bd1-66b57cf4f2bf.text|b4c1d9fbb5a0419f8af24aa07990e8b8
CrowdStrike Intelligence Confidence Assessment High Confidence: Judgments are based on high-quality information from multiple sources. High confidence in the quality and quantity of source information supporting a judgment does not imply that that assessment is an absolute certainty or fact. The judgment still has a marginal probability of being inaccurate. Moderate Confidence: Judgments are based on information that is credibly sourced and plausible, but not of sufficient quantity or corroborated sufficiently to warrant a higher level of confidence. This level of confidence is used to express that judgments carry an increased probability of being incorrect until more information is available or corroborated. Low Confidence: Judgments are made where the credibility of the source is uncertain, the information is too fragmented or poorly corroborated enough to make solid analytic inferences, or the reliability of the source is untested. Further information is needed for corroboration of the information or to fill known intelligence gaps.

"Ransomware Preparedness: A Call to Action crowdstrike.com/blog/ransomware-preparedness-a-call-to-action/ Josh Dalman - Kamil Janton - Eben Kaplan

April 27, 2021

Hardly a day passes without news of another company, hospital, school district or municipal government temporarily brought to a halt by ransomware. In fact, ransomware attacks have become so commonplace that they make the news far less than they used to. Yet while ransomware may no longer captivate the public’s attention, security professionals justifiably continue to obsess over it. Ransomware remains the most profitable method for cybercriminals to monetize their unauthorized access into business networks, with increasing ransom demands often ranging from $1 million to $10 million USD. For this reason alone, all organizations are potential targets for ransomware campaigns that almost always have a costly business impact, including disruption to operations and extortion that involves sensitive data theft. Ransomware preparedness has become imperative for all organizations, so much so that even chief executives and boards of directors are recognizing it as part of their responsibility to promote good governance. But it is a cat-and-mouse game — as defenses improve, ransomware actors continue to innovate to find new methods to compromise and extort their victims.

The CrowdStrike® Services team routinely assists organizations both in preparing for and responding to ransomware attacks. The following are some of the practices we recommend most frequently.

Improve Resiliency of Internet-facing Applications CrowdStrike has observed eCrime threat actors exploiting single-factor authentication and unpatched internet-facing applications. BOSS SPIDER, one of the initial big game hunting (BGH) ransomware threat actors, routinely targeted systems with Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) accessible from the internet. Less sophisticated threat actors operating ransomware variants such as Dharma, Phobos and GlobeImposter frequently gain access through RDP brute-force attacks. CrowdStrike recommends against RDP being exposed directly to the internet. Organizations currently leveraging the CrowdStrike Falcon® platform can quickly and effectively identify systems being actively brute-forced via RDP by using the following query in the Falcon Event Activity Monitor: event_simpleName=UserLogonFailed2 | iplocation RemoteAddressIP4 | stats values(ClientComputerName) AS ClientComputerNames dc(UserName) values(LogonDomain) AS LogonDomains dc(RemoteAddressIP4) values(LogonType_decimal) dc(Country) count by event_simpleName ComputerName | sort -""dc(Country)"""|data_input/mimic_reports/entry_957c4b85-304f-4664-aa0f-e01cdc42f6a6.text|ffdf46a4ed154b9fa3d2d3427ae4e2ea
In a separate but similar campaign in 2020, CrowdStrike observed CIRCUS SPIDER, the group behind the development of Netwalker ransomware, and TWISTED SPIDER, the group behind the development of Maze ransomware, exploit CVEs (common vulnerabilities and exposures) associated with Pulse VPN to gain access into victim organizations. For this reason, CrowdStrike recommends utilizing a VPN with multifactor authentication, and ensuring that any CVEs associated with the VPN platform(s) and the underlying authentication application are prioritized for patching. This principle should extend to all remote methods including, but not limited to Azure Active Directory (AD) and Citrix Gateway. The latter, being used by threat actors such as TRAVELING SPIDER — the criminal developer of Nemty ransomware — has been observed by CrowdStrike to take advantage of single-factor authentication to gain access to victim organizations through Citrix Gateway and send extortion-related emails using the victim’s own Microsoft Office 365 instance.|data_input/mimic_reports/entry_957c4b85-304f-4664-aa0f-e01cdc42f6a6.text|e50bbf0abcde47189cdfde2e56f29b0f
Implement and Enhance Email Security Gaining an initial foothold into a victim organization through a phishing email is the most common tactic for BGH ransomware groups. Typically, these phishing emails contain a malicious link or URL that delivers a payload to the recipient’s workstation. CrowdStrike recommends implementing an email security solution that conducts URL filtering and also attachment sandboxing. To streamline these efforts, an automated response capability can be used to allow for retroactive quarantining of delivered emails 2/7|data_input/mimic_reports/entry_957c4b85-304f-4664-aa0f-e01cdc42f6a6.text|bbb184f9cf784eeab16476de27b45a06
before the user interacts with them. In addition, organizations may want to restrict users from receiving password-protected zip files, executables, javascripts or Windows installer package files unless there is a legitimate business need. Adding an “[External]” tag to emails originating from outside of the organization and a warning message on top of the email’s body can help remind users to use discretion when handling such emails. Users should also have a documented process to report any emails they are unsure of along the way. In addition, if business permits, organizations should consider restricting users’ access to personal email accounts. As always, organizations should also implement a robust security awareness program that includes routine user training, reminders and “phish-me” campaigns. Creating your own “phish-me” campaign is one of the best and safest ways for your employees to learn to not be fooled by phishing emails. The old adage applies: “Fool me once, shame on you — fool me twice, shame on me.” CrowdStrike employs this best practice internally.|data_input/mimic_reports/entry_957c4b85-304f-4664-aa0f-e01cdc42f6a6.text|911befc8808a410082b475f227d868eb
"Harden Endpoints Throughout an attack lifecycle that ultimately culminates in a ransomware deployment, threat actors will often leverage a number of endpoint exploitation techniques. These exploitation techniques vary from exploiting poor AD configurations to leveraging publicly available exploits against unpatched systems or applications. A proper endpoint hardening strategy will ensure that threat actors have to defeat multiple defensive layers before achieving success in the attack. Each layer of defense the threat actor encounters provides an opportunity for defensive teams to detect and ultimately contain the activity before it results in ransomware deployment. The list below includes some key system-hardening actions for defenders to implement. It is important to note this is not an exhaustive list, and system hardening should be an iterative process. Ensure full coverage across all endpoints on your network for endpoint security products, and for the endpoint detection and protection (EDR) platform. Each endpoint security platform should have strict anti-tampering protections and alerting in place if and when a sensor goes offline or gets uninstalled. Develop a vulnerability and patch management program. Doing so will ensure that all endpoint applications and operating systems are kept up-to-date. Ransomware actors leverage endpoint vulnerabilities for many purposes, including but not limited to privilege escalation and lateral movement.

Follow Active Directory security best practices. Based on some of the most common AD downfalls observed by CrowdStrike Services during ransomware engagements, we recommend these steps: Avoid easy-to-guess passwords with weak authentication methods. Avoid having regular domain users with local administrator privileges, and local administrator accounts with the same passwords across the entire enterprise or large portions of the enterprise. Limit workstation-to-workstation communication. While this can be achieved using group policy objects (GPOs), it can be also achieved through a number of microsegmentation software options. Avoid sharing privileged credentials. Poor security practices include shared administrative accounts and using administrator accounts for personal or day-today business activity that does not require administrator privileges. Note that the first two points above can be accomplished using AD with little to no additional costs. At an additional cost, a privileged access management (PAM) solution can provide a much more scalable and robust solution to the same problem and is discussed more later in this blog post. With the recent acquisition of Preempt, CrowdStrike is continuously adding capabilities to its Zero Trust framework. The “Implement an Identity and Access Management (IAM)” section of this blog explains how Falcon Zero Trust can help you further harden your endpoints and improve your IAM program."|data_input/mimic_reports/entry_957c4b85-304f-4664-aa0f-e01cdc42f6a6.text|0def79259e094bdab58b15157fda6326
"Ransomware-proof Data with Offline Backups In recent years, and since the emergence of ransomware as a top method of monetizing attacks, the developers behind malicious code have become very effective at ensuring victims and security researchers cannot decrypt affected data without paying the ransom for the decryption key. Further, when developing a ransomware-proof backup infrastructure, the most important idea to consider is that threat actors have targeted online backups before deploying ransomware to the environment. For these reasons, the only sure way of salvaging data during a ransomware attack is through ransomware-proof backups. For example, maintaining offline backups of your data allows for a quicker recovery in emergencies. The following points should be considered when developing a ransomware-proof offline backup infrastructure: Offline backups, as well as the indexes (describing which volumes contain which data) should be completely separate from the rest of the infrastructure. Access to such networks should be controlled via strict access control lists (ACLs), and all authentications should be performed using multifactor authentication (MFA).

4/7"|data_input/mimic_reports/entry_957c4b85-304f-4664-aa0f-e01cdc42f6a6.text|e045a382d0464d07926027ccee5ed4aa
"4/7

Administrators with access to both offline and online infrastructures should avoid reusing account passwords and use a jump box when accessing the offline backup infrastructure. Cloud storage services, with strict ACLs and rules, can also serve as offline backup infrastructure. Emergency situations such as a ransomware attack should be the only time the offline infrastructure is allowed a connection to the live network."|data_input/mimic_reports/entry_957c4b85-304f-4664-aa0f-e01cdc42f6a6.text|38709bdc56ee4498a9686f3dd2ef8b97
Restrict Access to Virtualization Management Infrastructure As mentioned earlier, threat actors engaged in big game hunting ransomware campaigns are continuously innovating to increase the effectiveness of their attacks. The most recent such development includes the ability to attack virtualized infrastructure directly. This approach allows for targeting of hypervisors that deploy and store virtual machines (VMDK). As a result, the endpoint security products installed on the virtualized machines are blind to malicious actions taken on the hypervisor. To further understand how this attack would unfold, we will use some of VMware’s naming convention as it is the most common virtualizing product found in today’s enterprise environments. Many ESXi systems (VMware hypervisors) do not have Secure Shell (SSH) protocol enabled by default and are usually managed via vCenter. If SSH is disabled, previously stolen administrative credentials are used to enable SSH on all ESXi systems. Once that is complete, a valid account is used to SSH into each ESXi system being targeted. Before the threat actor deploys the Linux-based ransomware, VMDKs hosted on the ESXi are stopped to allow the ransomware binary to access the files for encryption purposes. Systems impacted by the ransomware through this deployment method will be completely offline and inaccessible to the users.|data_input/mimic_reports/entry_957c4b85-304f-4664-aa0f-e01cdc42f6a6.text|ffbc45872c514b669d14645779f8c0ff
"Recently, CrowdStrike Intelligence has observed this method being used by CARBON SPIDER and SPRITE SPIDER, and CrowdStrike expects this trend to continue to be used and adopted by eCrime operators. As adoption of this tactic becomes wider, the following items can help organizations strengthen their virtualized environments. Restrict access to ESXi hosts to a small number of systems, and ensure these systems are fully patched and have proper endpoint monitoring in place. ESXi systems are commonly managed via LDAP-binded Active Directory accounts, which are often privileged accounts targeted by the threat actor earlier in the compromise. Removing or limiting such bindings could minimize the chance of an already-compromised administrative account being used to target the ESXi systems with ransomware. Ensure SSH access is disabled, or ensure that it is secured by MFA.

5/7

Ensure passwords are unique to each ESXi host as well as to the web client and are strong/complex, using a combination of letters, special characters and numbers. Avoid using dictionary words and “1337” speak. Enable Normal Lockdown Mode to further restrict access. See reference here."|data_input/mimic_reports/entry_957c4b85-304f-4664-aa0f-e01cdc42f6a6.text|ff36445dade94d15b513608373a1040b
Implement an Identity and Access Management (IAM) Program Organizations can improve their security posture by implementing a robust IAM program that maintains an activity trail for all privileged and service accounts, with immediate identification for anomalous traffic or abnormal resource requests. To help organizations implement an IAM program, CrowdStrike offers two Identity Protection modules: Falcon Zero Trust and Falcon Identity Threat Detection. Deploying these modules to an existing Falcon instance will create real-time layers of threat prevention of identitybased attacks and anomalies targeting an organization. The adaptive capabilities of this platform allow enterprises to automate responses with the right type of enforcement or notification based on identity, behavior and risk. For example, service accounts attempting to connect via RDP, or RDP connecting to an unusual destination, could be challenged via multifactor authentication or blocked by Falcon Zero Trust in real time. In addition, nearly all BGH ransomware groups will utilize off-the-shelf credential dumping tools such as Mimikatz or SPRITE SPIDER’s PyXie and LaZagne modules to steal credentials and expand their foothold within the environment. The output of the tools are then used by the attackers to move laterally within a network using techniques such as Pass-theHash, Pass-the-Ticket, Kerberoasting and others.|data_input/mimic_reports/entry_957c4b85-304f-4664-aa0f-e01cdc42f6a6.text|bfbc762dd2cc492ea214639ea8d037a3
"An IAM platform such as Falcon Identity Protection can detect credential exploitation as well as the use of risky protocols and abnormal behavior within the AD environment. These detections will identify devices and accounts that have been compromised and, based on the configured policy, decide if such accounts need to be challenged via MFA/2FA or blocked to halt the progress of the attack. This will significantly cripple BGH ransomware groups from being able to act on their objectives.

Develop and Pressure-test an Incident Response Plan Organizations sometimes become aware of threat actor activity within their environment, but they lack the visibility to address the problem or the right intelligence to understand the nature of the threat. Recognizing the threat and responding quickly and effectively can be the difference between a major incident and a near miss. Incident response plans and playbooks help facilitate that speedy decision making. Plans should cover all parts of the response effort, across the organization. For the security team, they should provide aids to decision-making so that front-line responders don’t overlook

important details while triaging alerts. They should also outline the extent of the security team’s authority to take decisive actions — such as shutting down business-essential services — if a ransomware attack appears imminent. For the crisis management team, plans should identify who will be involved and what their roles and responsibilities are. It should also tee up important decisions, like when to activate an incident response retainer, whether to notify insurance carriers, when and how to involve in-house or outside counsel, and how to discuss ransom demands with executives. Consider conducting regular tabletop exercises to test the incident response plan and processes. Some organizations may benefit from simulated exercises such as “purple team” engagements, where red teamers mimic ransomware operators’ actions on objectives, including data exfiltration and ultimately ransomware deployment. CrowdStrike also recommends regular exercising of your incident response plan, both planned and unplanned, such as utilizing a red team to conduct a mock attack operation. Organizations should never be surprised or caught flat-footed by an attack — it should be expected and planned for."|data_input/mimic_reports/entry_957c4b85-304f-4664-aa0f-e01cdc42f6a6.text|8f86217498754ed682b6d4f6779a82bb
"Take Steps Now Any organization can fall victim to costly ransomware campaigns with ransom demands in the seven digits, but much can be done to stop threat actors before they get a chance to detonate a widespread ransomware attack. Locking down common initial entry vectors, implementing multifactor authentication, and hardening of both endpoint and Active Directory infrastructure can pay dividends by improving an organization’s resiliency to ransomware threat actors. While it’s not possible to prevent all network intrusions, creating enough obstacles through principles of security-in-depth, and the recommended “1-10-60” benchmark time (one minute to detect an incident, 10 minutes to investigate and one hour to remediate), can ensure that threat actors are halted before achieving their objectives of data theft and ransomware deployment.
