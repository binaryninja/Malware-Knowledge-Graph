health policy|india|The presented study aims to analyze the implementation of India's Health Sector Reform (HSR) in terms of its impact on human resource, specifically auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs), under India's Public Health Standards (IPHS). The study is a part of the larger project 'Strengthening health systems in Tamil Nadu through implementation research' (SHaTTh-IR), which aims to build evidence for health system strengthening and policy-making in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Health Policy in India has undergone major reforms over the last few decades, aiming to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its health systems. The National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) was launched in 2005 as a part of the HSR process with the aim to provide accessible and affordable healthcare services to the rural population. One of the components of NRHM is IPHS, which aims to improve healthcare service delivery and quality through accreditation and certification processes. ANMs are key functionaries under this scheme, responsible for delivering basic maternal and child health services in rural areas. This study will examine the extent to which IPHS has led to improvements in human resource management, particularly in terms of ANMs, and contribute to policy-making and implementation in this area.|921a13449c644c188817e980ae67485c
