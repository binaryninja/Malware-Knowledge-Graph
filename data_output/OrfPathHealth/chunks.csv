147Mental Health as a 
Pathway to Health 
Equity
 Pratima Murthy, Krishna Prasad Muliyala, and  
Channaveerachari Naveen Kumar
Equity, diversity, and inclusiveness are the basic tenets of distributive 
justice and are essential goals for development. The World Health 
Organization (WHO) envisages that health equity can be achieved when 
everyone attains their full potential for health and well-being. This includes 
mental health. According to WHO’s definition, ‘mental health’ is a state of 
mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, 
realise their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their 
community.1 
Mental health is closely linked with many of the United Nations (UN) 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).2 It comprises people’s individual 
and collective abilities to make decisions, build relationships, and shape the 
world, and is more than the mere absence of mental illness. In its broadest 
sense, mental health encompasses promotive and preventive aspects, while 
mental disorders or illnesses (used interchangeably in this article) are more 
focused on treatment and rehabilitative aspects. However, mental health 
and well-being is equally important for persons with mental disorders, as 
much as it is for those without such disorders."|data_input/OrfPathHealth/MentalHealthPathwayToEquity.pdf|0|422ffd0b9f1e43be891bfa4022ff0269

149Integrating Mental Health into General Healthcare
The complex interaction of biological, psychological, and social determinants 
shapes an individual’s mental health. There is evidence that poverty and 
other adverse social circumstances are risk factors for poor mental health, 
and for mental disorders. Biological vulnerability as well as psychosocial 
distress predispose an individual to common mental disorders like 
depression, substance use disorders, and behavioural addictions.3 They can 
also be reasons for relapse for  episodes of severe mental illness (SMI) 
such as schizophrenia or bipolar mood disorder.
The relationship between social adversity, mental distress, mental and 
physical illness is both interactive and complex. The presence of mental 
illness, particularly SMI, can drive people to poverty and worsen mental 
distress for both the individual and their family. Similarly, psychosocial 
adversity is a recognised risk factor in conditions like diabetes and 
tuberculosis and influences health outcomes.4,5 Socioeconomic, political, 
cultural and place-based conditions all determine health outcomes, including 
on mental health. 
Multimorbidity—defined as the co-occurrence of more than one chronic 
condition in an individual—can occur a decade earlier in those who are 
experiencing socioeconomic vulnerabilities.6 When two or more conditions"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/MentalHealthPathwayToEquity.pdf|1|d8ac3a127087488cb1f605559cc9e21a
"condition in an individual—can occur a decade earlier in those who are 
experiencing socioeconomic vulnerabilities.6 When two or more conditions 
cluster together (both contributing and resulting in socioeconomic 
inequalities), medical specialists use the term ‘syndemic’ to describe such 
a situation. Therefore, the contextual determinants of health and disease 
are paramount in the conceptual framework of syndemics. Moreover, the 
two or more chronic conditions can interact and lead to adverse mutual 
outcomes for the conditions. The imperative, therefore, is to shed a 
dichotomous approach to mental and physical health and integrate them 
both in healthcare service delivery.
The challenge is how to efficiently distribute healthcare resources to those 
who most need them. In many regions of the world, while disadvantaged 
populations need greater healthcare, they receive less.7 Some sections 
of society (for example, those with mental illness) may warrant greater 
allocations of resources, as much as equal treatment is required for similar 
needs. Health economists and the World Health Organization (WHO) have"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/MentalHealthPathwayToEquity.pdf|1|3ce1c09aaca9419db0174ae024084f14
"149Mental Health as a Pathway to Health Equityargued that investing in mental health is important from the point of view 
of improving population health and reducing social inequality, promoting 
human rights, and improving economic efficiency.8 The economic implications 
of mental and substance disorders can be enormous: for example, the 
global economic loss due to common mental disorders is an estimated US$ 
1 trillion per year.9 Given the increasing prevalence of mental illness, the 
costs are likely to only further mount. Investment in treatment of mental 
illness can result in large economic productivity gains.10
The Burden of Mental Health, Substance Use Disorders and 
Multimorbidity
Mental and substance-abuse disorders are leading contributors to premature 
morbidity and mortality globally. In India, for example, the National Mental 
Health Survey (NMHS), 2015-16, has reported a 13.6-percent lifetime 
prevalence of any mental/substance-abuse disorder morbidity.11 The overall 
number of Disability-Adjusted-Life-Years (DALYs) for mental disorders has 
increased by more than 50 percent between 1990 and 2019.12 This growth 
pattern is expected to continue, necessitating a proportionate response from 
the health systems. Most of the mental and substance abuse disorders 
are chronic and disabling conditions. The treatment gap for mental and 
substance abuse disorders (defined as proportions of those needing care"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/MentalHealthPathwayToEquity.pdf|2|4b2a3063fa0c49049ee3978e8874a08e
"are chronic and disabling conditions. The treatment gap for mental and 
substance abuse disorders (defined as proportions of those needing care 
but not receiving) remains high (about 75 percent), contributing to the 
high burden at various levels (individual, family and community). A vast 
majority of the population cannot afford out-of-pocket (OOP) spending 
for the treatment of mental and substance abuse disorders and psychiatric 
rehabilitation. 
Such out-of-pocket expenditure, in India, is dominated by medicines.13 In 
more than half of the population, non-medical costs such as expenses 
on travel and accommodation contribute to more than one-third of OOP 
spending. The share of doctors’ fees and diagnostic charges in OOP 
expenditure is high in private healthcare settings.14 Discrimination in the 
coverage by health insurance toward mental illness significantly raises 
the chances of catastrophic spending in such circumstances.  Despite the 
Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) having 
directed Indian insurance companies to cover mental illnesses as per the"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/MentalHealthPathwayToEquity.pdf|2|0e7eb893bc5f496cadc42399e6dcc1ce

151Mental Health Care Act, 2017, there have been many   reported violations of 
the provision of the Act.15 The violations have included rejections of claims 
for mental illness by insurance companies and discriminatory ceilings on 
the sum of reimbursement for mental illness. 
Worldwide, people with SMI have shortened life expectancy by 10-20 
years, which is explained by the high rates of multimorbidity.16 Yet the 
interventions to address the multimorbidity, primarily non-communicable 
diseases (NCDs) and the associated risk factors such as tobacco and alcohol 
use, physical inactivity, and poor diets—are insufficient for this group. 
The existing national programs to address these chronic conditions seem 
oriented vertically with poor horizontal integration across the programmes. 
Homeless persons, women, persons with developmental disorders, and 
elderly with mental illness experience even further inequities among the 
unequal. 
The living conditions of persons in India with SMI chronically and who 
reside in psychiatric hospitals have been highlighted through public interest 
litigations and addressed by the active intervention of the judiciary. The 
National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), with the technical support 
of the National Institute of Mental Health & Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), 
Bengaluru, has reviewed the rights violations of persons with SMI in these"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/MentalHealthPathwayToEquity.pdf|3|264356480e46446ca4ca7150f6fcc65a

Bengaluru, has reviewed the rights violations of persons with SMI in these 
hospitals and monitored the required systemic changes.17,18 
Over the last two decades, there have been consistent efforts toward 
developing a better systemic response in the care of persons with mental 
illness. 
Key Efforts in Improving Mental Healthcare in India
The NMHS, 2015-16, India, reported the current prevalence of any mental 
morbidity to be 10.56 percent.19 Those with low education and lower 
income, and are middle-aged were at the highest risk for mental illness.20 
Only two out of every 10 individuals with mental illness received mental 
healthcare.21 Lack of mental health resources (e.g., shortage of mental health 
professionals), poor mental health literacy, stigma and discrimination,"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/MentalHealthPathwayToEquity.pdf|3|a8abadb5a3854419980fc641aaac297f
"151Mental Health as a Pathway to Health Equitysocial inequality, gender issues and lack of community participation may 
be among the various factors that impede mental health equity in India.  
To be sure, India has made strides toward improving mental healthcare 
(summarised in Box 1). India was one of the first Asian countries to have 
a National Program for Mental Health (NMHP; as early as 1982). The 
District Mental Health Program (DMHP) today covers 700 districts across 
the country. The DMHP is the implementation arm of the NMHP tasked 
to ensure the availability and accessibility of minimum mental healthcare, 
integration of mental health in general healthcare, and to promote 
community participation in mental health development.

153Moreover, the availability of psychotropic medications in primary healthcare 
has also improved. Screening and basic management of mental illness have 
been incorporated into the services offered at Health and Wellness Centres 
(HWC). India has a progressive Mental Health Policy (2014) based on equity, 
justice, integrated and evidence-based care in a rights-based approach.22 
The use of digital technology is being leveraged for training and expanding 
human resources for mental health care in the country through digital 
academies at NIMHANS as well as other institutions. The National Tobacco 
Control Program has employed a mobile-based strategy called m-Cessation 
and tobacco quit-lines to support those who wish to quit tobacco.23,24 The 
Government of India launched the National Tele Mental Health Program 
(Tele Mental Health Assistance and Networking Across States: Tele-MANAS) 
initiative on World Mental Health Day, 2022, to provide 24/7 comprehensive 
tele-mental health services that cater to remote and underserved areas.25 
The Tele-MANAS initiative—a phone-based, counsellor-led service—aims to 
address mental distress, identify mental illnesses and behaviours that need 
specialist mental health referrals, and improve service networking in each

"153Mental Health as a Pathway to Health EquityThe Government of India’s flagship insurance scheme, Ayushman Bharat-
Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojna (PM-JAY), aims to achieve Universal 
Health Care (UHC) in India.26 The scheme will cover most secondary and 
tertiary hospitalisations for nearly 40 percent of the population. The annual 
coverage of INR 500,000 per family is irrespective of family size. The 
scheme does not, however, cover outpatient expenses. Generic medicines 
have been made available in Jan Aushadhi Kendras.27 The availability of 
generic medicines at cheaper rates than branded drugs will likely reduce 
the economic burden for all sections of society, especially the poor and 
marginalised. The second pillar of the PM-JAY is the provision of universal, 
comprehensive healthcare in primary care through the 150,000 Health and 
Wellness Centres (HWC). The HWC will act as the first point of contact 
for comprehensive services, including screening and essential mental health 
conditions management.
Two progressive legislations were enacted by the Government of India in 
the backdrop of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with Disability to address critical concerns of inequality and inequity in 
mental healthcare. The Rights of Persons with Disability Act (RPWD), 
2016 has provided a reservation of 1 percent for mental illness-related 
disabilities in recruitment to government jobs or aided organisations.28"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/MentalHealthPathwayToEquity.pdf|6|5c43ba3a34074ab9b14580755e1c98ae

disabilities in recruitment to government jobs or aided organisations.28 
The Act guarantees reasonable accommodation in education and work in 
government institutions for persons with disability. The Mental Health 
Care Act (MHCA) 2017 provides the right to access mental healthcare and 
treatment from mental health services run or funded by the appropriate 
Government.29 The provision under the Act encompasses a range of services 
for persons with mental illness, including psychiatric rehabilitation and 
community reintegration. The Act also underscores the need for integrating 
mental health services with general health services at all levels. The MHCA 
2017 also directs parity for mental illness in health insurance as is available 
for physical conditions. Appointing persons with mental illness, their family 
members and NGOs in the Central and State Mental Health Authorities and 
the Mental Health Review Boards is an affirmative step towards ensuring 
checks and balances in the delivery of mental healthcare in an equitable 
manner."|data_input/OrfPathHealth/MentalHealthPathwayToEquity.pdf|6|ef8b3b7c8544456db1b80edd381daa9e

155Thus, there have been improvements in curative and preventive care domains 
for mental and substance use disorders in the last decade. However, these 
need to be translated on the ground. There is also still a lack of adequate 
focus on rehabilitative care, which remains restricted to select tertiary care 
mental health institutions. 
The Way Forward
If the vision of the National Mental Health Policy 2014 must be truly 
realised, its strategic directions and recommendations for action will need to 
be implemented. The distinct mental health needs of vulnerable populations 
such as children, the elderly, the homeless, require to be addressed. Macro-
environmental issues such as poverty, unemployment, displacement, and 
emerging concerns such as the mental health impact of climate change 
require particular focus. Leadership and governance at various levels must 
be strengthened. Mental health systems should be strengthened at various 
levels to provide decentralised care in smaller administrative units such as 
the taluks /blocks. 
Preventive and promotive aspects of mental health provide an opportunity 
to integrate existing mainstream/biomedical as well as alternative/traditional 
systems of care, including Yoga. Mental health should be effectively 
addressed at the workplace. The mental health of children and adolescents 
should take primacy and can be addressed in educational settings."|data_input/OrfPathHealth/MentalHealthPathwayToEquity.pdf|7|7cce2ea34f0249fe9a54a17d2c6bcb85
"addressed at the workplace. The mental health of children and adolescents

However, given that there may be a substantial group of out-of-school 
children and adolescents, as well as a large proportion of the population 
that works in the unorganised sector, there is a need to expand the reach 
of access to mental healthcare. A life-span approach to mental healthcare, 
extending from perinatal care to elderly care is recommended. Research in 
public mental health aspects is another priority. Mental health indicators 
need to be standardised and incorporated in governance regularly. The

"155Mental Health as a Pathway to Health EquityInequity in mental healthcare needs to be systematically measured and 
monitored in LMICs to identify gaps and to inform policies and programmes. 
WHO has developed the Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT and HEAT 
Plus) software to explore and compare within-country health inequalities 
and across settings using disaggregated datasets.31 Simultaneously, there is 
a need to learn from successful models developed in High-Income Countries 
(HICs). For example, in the United Kingdom (UK), the National Health 
Service (NHS) through the Five-Year Forward View for Mental Health has 
prioritised addressing inequity.32 There have been debates in the public 
health domain for “disparity interventions” that are specifically designed 
for populations that face inequality.33 Most of the existing inequality 
interventions in the mental health field from the HICs have focused on 
racial disparities, age-related factors, and socioeconomic issues. While 
developing, testing, and implementing the interventions, at each stage, all 
stakeholders including the service users will have to get involved. 
To ensure universal health coverage for mental health, specific efforts have 
been conducted by WHO in six early adopter countries. Inadequate human 
resource and inequitable distribution of specialists were reported to be the 
crucial issues in the situational analysis.34 In India, for the PM-JAY to"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/MentalHealthPathwayToEquity.pdf|8|252f9895e28748adb6ebaa67d5dadb0f
"crucial issues in the situational analysis.34 In India, for the PM-JAY to 
meet the goal of universal health coverage, service delivery needs to be 
strengthened at all levels and systems to maintain continuity of care must 
be created, an area that is particularly relevant for mental health.35 The 
coverage for non-PM-JAY patients, specifically non-below poverty line but 
belonging to lower/middle socioeconomic classes will have to be addressed 
to reduce catastrophic spending.36 Mechanisms of surveillance and health 
information must be further strengthened to encompass private healthcare 
providers. 
The national programmes for non-communicable diseases and chronic 
communicable diseases such as Tuberculosis need to consider that 
most patients with these conditions have multimorbidity and align the 
programmes with the NMHP at various levels. Integration of care at the 
primary care level and the HWC will have to be implemented as envisioned 
in the PM-JAY, with an emphasis to improve patient reported outcomes, 
besides clinical outcomes. There is sufficient evidence for self-management 
and peer-based interventions for chronic conditions that have emerged 
and have been successfully implemented in HICs.37,38 They must be adapted"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/MentalHealthPathwayToEquity.pdf|8|7456f0334e9840cba532ec95cc0fda8f

157to the cultural settings of LMICs. The effectiveness of brief psychological 
interventions delivered by lay counsellors for moderate to severe depressive 
disorders and harmful drinking in primary care has been demonstrated in 
India.39,40 
These low-cost interventions may have important lessons for HIC as the 
health systems in HICs are overwhelmed with long waiting periods for 
psychological intervention. Low-intensity interventions such as WHO’s 
Problem Management plus (PM+) can be used in low-human resource 
settings for adults in distress due to exposure to adversity.41 Families 
are an important resource for care provision in LMICs, specifically in the 
context of mental health and the role and concerns of family caregivers 
must be formally addressed. Indigenous interventions such as Yoga as well 
as alternative forms of medicine have potential benefits for multimorbidity. 
An evidence-based integration into the public health system may enhance 
outcomes as they are culturally acceptable and may have a broad spectrum 
of action.  
Technology has been harnessed in healthcare in India as exemplified 
by the Tele-MANAS programme. However, the metrics to monitor the

successful translation of policies and programmes on the ground requires

39The COVID-19 pandemic took the world by surprise. In early 2020, no 
one would have thought that in months to come, millions of people 
would be in ‘lockdown’, trillions of dollars would be lost to the global 
economy, and over 7 million people would die from the disease caused by 
the novel coronavirus. For many years before 2020, scientists and medical 
experts had been warning that the world was simply not ready for disease 
‘X’; such a pandemic was almost inevitable, however, coming as it did 
from a zoonotic virus for which no vaccines or drugs had been developed.
Although it has been declared that the Public Health Emergency of 
International Concern relating to COVID-19 is over, many countries, 
especially low-income ones, still have a substantial number of COVID-19 
cases and are without access to the vaccines and drugs they need. There is 
the risk of becoming complacent again. There are hundreds of thousands 
of bird and animal viruses that could get transmitted to humans, and 
potentially onwards from human to human. A new infectious disease can 
almost certainly strike. The question is when.
While not all disease outbreaks can be prevented, they can be arrested so 
that they do not escalate into an epidemic or pandemic. Social inequalities Barbara StockingThe Urgent Need for

41can be reduced, and health systems strengthened, to better protect 
populations against such outbreaks. The imperative is to understand what 
went wrong, and what it would take to make things right.
Critical Failures
To prevent history from repeating itself, the global community would do 
well to learn the lessons of COVID-19.
a. Countries were insufficiently prepared. Even those with strong healthcare 
systems geared to tackle pandemics had not tested them through, 
for instance, simulation exercises. Poorer countries did not have the 
resources to run a fully functioning public health system. In almost 
all countries, there was little understanding of the implications of a 
lockdown—for livelihoods and the economy, trade, and social services 
such as education .
b. Aside from public health experts, others had no understanding of how 
fast an outbreak can develop into a pandemic. Initially, governments 
took a ‘wait and see’ approach rather than precautionary action.  February 
2020 was a critical month when the opportunity to take control of the 
virus was lost.
c. Countries did not comply with the International Health Regulations 
(IHR) which have been in place since 2005, and often did not accept 
evidence-based advice from the World Health Organization (WHO).
d. The wide inequities between countries and population groups were 
exacerbated, and the consequences were dire in determining who had"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/UrgentNeedForPandemicAccors.pdf|1|9a5fb26f97944249bc2c6dbbee7bd4b5
"d. The wide inequities between countries and population groups were 
exacerbated, and the consequences were dire in determining who had

A New Pandemic Treaty and Amendments to the IHR
Early on in the pandemic, calls were made for action including developing 
a ‘pandemic treaty’ that would set out what countries need to do, and hold 
them to account. At a special session of the World Health Assembly (WHA)"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/UrgentNeedForPandemicAccors.pdf|1|82925b5296d34fcbbd07c71e6285ea37
"41The Urgent Need for a Pandemic Accordin 2021, WHO’s 194 member states agreed to negotiate a new ‘Convention 
Accord or other International Instrument’ on pandemic preparedness and 
response (PPR) (referred to as the WHO CA+ or the Pandemic Accord).1 
The work began with an Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB) being 
established with a final proposal to be delivered to the WHA in May 2024. 
In May 2022, it was also agreed that a Working Group on amendments to 
the IHR should be established (WGIHR).2 Its report is due at the end of 
2023. All member states are engaged in both negotiations.
From the beginning, the scope of the changes to the IHR has been 
contentious. The resolution of the WHA was to keep it to a small number 
of amendments, but some countries argued for a much wider scope. They 
sought,  for example, for ‘One Health’a prevention measures, and equity in 
access to drugs and vaccines. It has led to 300 amendments to the IHR 
being submitted to the WGIHR. Countries which might have preferred a 
more limited approach also jumped in when it was clear that the scope 
was to be broader. As a result, many proposed changes are similar to those 
suggested in the Pandemic Accord.
Ultimately, there has to be coherence and compatibility between the Accord 
and the IHR. It is likely that the Accord will have more of the overarching

conflicting recommendations.
Guiding Principles

43• Solidarity.
Preventing outbreaks from turning into pandemics is a collective 
responsibility and is in every country’s self-interest. Unhelpful campaigning 
on social media and elsewhere has suggested that a new treaty could 
challenge the sovereignty of a country. That is not the case; countries will 
continue to take their own decisions. The Charter of the United Nations 
affirms the sovereignty of States Parties in addressing their own public 
health matters.3 However, it also sets out the obligation to ensure that 
“activities within their own jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to 
their peoples, other States Parties, and areas beyond the limits of national 
jurisdiction”.
• Equity.
Morality and national self-interest demand equitable access to all tools, 
including vaccines, diagnostics and treatments, and financing for these 
resources. Equity includes a change of attitude in governance. There 
needs to be equity in governance systems, for example, in financing for 
preparedness and response to pandemics. It should not be just controlled 
by donors.
Equity also means fairness in the assessment of what countries are capable 
of. There are significant differences in each country’s ability to deliver 
preparedness and response. Poorer countries simply do not have the same 
level of resources as the developed ones.
• Transparency."|data_input/OrfPathHealth/UrgentNeedForPandemicAccors.pdf|3|93da291caa4f47eda2643c323f552507

• Transparency.
Transparency of data and genomic sequencing are vital to responding

between countries.

"43The Urgent Need for a Pandemic Accordcivil society organisations have been sceptical about whether a new treaty 
would make a difference, pointing out that compliance with the IHR is still 
lacking. That challenge must be met.
Accountability should be to the people of each country through parliamentary 
systems and civil society. It is also needed for mutual assurance between 
countries. When governments require extraordinary actions from their 
populations—for example, lockdowns and mask mandates—they need to be 
confident that other countries are also taking appropriate action.
Building Consensus
Early in 2023 the ‘zero draft’ of the Accord was made available and 
the real negotiations began. Taking into account all the discussions and 
proposed texts from member states, a revised draft—the ‘first draft’—is 
to be produced in the summer of 2023. The negotiations are undoubtedly 
complex, but it is worth noting that a surprising amount seems to be 
commonly agreed upon.
The purpose of the Accord and its principles seem widely accepted, including 
the protection of the human rights of all people wherever and whoever they 
may be. There is particular concern that the needs of the most vulnerable 
people are taken into account in pandemics. There is commitment to the 
development of public health and healthcare systems and to protect staff, 
who are most at risk in epidemics and pandemics. There is a need to"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/UrgentNeedForPandemicAccors.pdf|4|0f7ab32f99de49388ec7f47d55f62bc0

who are most at risk in epidemics and pandemics. There is a need to 
communicate well with the public and deal with misinformation. There is 
commitment to a ‘whole-of-society’ approach for all plans and actions, 
and recognition of the need for global coordination.
There appears to be conceptual agreement that preparedness plans should 
involve all of government, and that there should be regular simulation 
exercises. A ‘Universal Health and Preparedness Review’ is suggested as 
a mechanism for review of each country’s preparedness. Both peer review 
of the plans as well as independent assessment are being discussed. 
Surprisingly, remarkably little is being said about public health response, 
presumably because so much of it falls within the IHR."|data_input/OrfPathHealth/UrgentNeedForPandemicAccors.pdf|4|22cc304d163540089e2e574688718ab6

However, it seems unlikely that a fully considered plan will be ready for the

Areas of Contention
The contentious issues are around equity, especially related to countries’ 
access to vaccines, drugs, and other medical equipment. Member states 
might sign up to the principle, but there are great differences among them 
on how this should be achieved. Developing countries are pressing for a 
wider spread of manufacturing, particularly for vaccines, but not only for 
them. Success in getting mRNA vaccine manufacturing underway in South 
Africa is a good start, although manufacturing for the whole continent and 
globally will require both financial investment and technology transfer. The"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/UrgentNeedForPandemicAccors.pdf|5|5aaf419340ed446388c170a975494f36
"globally will require both financial investment and technology transfer. The 
extent to which the pharmaceutical industry would be prepared to engage 
with technology transfer and the associated question of intellectual property 
rights is unclear.
Various models have been proposed to achieve access. When wealthier 
governments fund the research and development (R&D) of companies, for 
example, they could persuade industry players to earmark a percentage of 
vaccines for the poorer countries, or to sell these to them at cost. However, 
that would still leave the poorest countries at their mercy. Meanwhile, the 
pharmaceutical industry argues that without commercial pricing of new 
drugs and vaccines, there is no incentive for innovation.

"45The Urgent Need for a Pandemic AccordSuch debates are not new. The World Trade Organization struggled to reach 
an agreement on a Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights 
(TRIPS) waiver throughout the pandemic, with limited success.5 This was 
despite an early agreement on TRIPS waivers for drugs in a public health 
emergency, reached many years ago in 2001 during the Doha Trade Round.6
It is difficult to see how there can be a breakthrough, but developing 
countries have made it clear they will not support a new Accord which 
does not deal with equity of access.
Crucial Gaps
The Pandemic Accord and the IHR will fail if two areas are not attended 
to: financing and accountability.
Financing : The G20 Independent High-Level Panel estimated that the 
annual financing need for future preparedness and response to pandemics 
was US$ 31 billion.7 Even considering domestic and international financing, 
US$ 10 billion a year is required for PPR, which includes upgrading public 
health systems, R&D, and overall preparedness. If the amount seems high, 
it must be remembered that it is  a tiny amount compared to the cost of 
a pandemic.
The G20 report and another from the World Bank and WHO8 led to the 
establishing of the Pandemic Fund at the World Bank. However, the 
promised funding in the first year has been only US$ 1.6 billion, and there 
are concerns about how funds can be raised in the longer term. This is"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/UrgentNeedForPandemicAccors.pdf|6|c7a99ed0afc64ddd846b914246743dd2
"promised funding in the first year has been only US$ 1.6 billion, and there 
are concerns about how funds can be raised in the longer term. This is 
the moment for the G20 to deliberate on how the necessary financing can 
be found.
Accountability:  For the Accord and the IHR to succeed, countries must 
deliver on the obligations they have committed to. External accountability 
mechanisms are also needed as safeguards to ensure that all parties are 
answerable for these obligations. The Panel, which this author chairs, 
firmly believes that there should be independent assessment of countries—
their preparedness plans, response, and other matters which might be 
agreed upon in the Accord. WHO is a friend and supporter of countries,"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/UrgentNeedForPandemicAccors.pdf|6|7aa12dbfbe994dec81d06c120a98f78a

47which makes it difficult for it to challenge them in the public space. The 
Panel believes that the way forward is a small independent body for the 
Accord and perhaps the IHR, too. The Accord will be hosted by WHO but 
will have its own secretariat. An arms-length independent assessment body 
could be housed within the Accord’s treaty structure. The International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is one model being proposed, but because 
WHO already has much of the monitoring information, the independent 
assessment body need not be as large as the IAEA.
Assessments do not have to be about blaming and shaming. They need 
to be public but supportive, especially of countries that do not have the 
resources and are in need of financial and technical help. Pandemics create 
huge risks to individuals and nations. The public has a right to know what 
their governments and other governments are doing to protect them, and 
that includes ensuring countries across the world have the resources to 
deliver.

1819There is an enormous sense of relief that the world has already 
suffered the most acute stage of the COVID-19 pandemic—with 
its heartbreaking death toll, devastating illness, and crushing social and 
economic fallout. The job of hardening the world’s defences against future 
disease outbreaks, however, has only begun. Indeed, COVID-19 is still with 
us and will continue to smoulder for years to come, assuming it does 
not flare up again. Moreover, the prospect of future, and potentially more 
menacing, global infectious disease outbreaks remains in the horizon—
made more likely by factors like climate change, unabated encroachment 
on the habitats of wild animals that carry dangerous pathogens, population 
growth, and urbanisation. 
Now is the time to take stock of the many lessons of COVID-19 and, more

19pandemic preparedness and response. If they fail to do so, the global 
community will once again pay dearly—in lives lost and damaged and in 
profound economic and social shocks.
The overarching and perhaps most obvious lesson of the pandemic was 
that most countries, and the world collectively, were unprepared to defend 
themselves against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.1 Nearly all 
countries—even those whose health systems were presumed to be strong—
struggled not just to arrest the spread and blunt the devastating impacts 
of the virus but also to continue delivering other vital health services.2 
This was no surprise to the many global health experts who had long 
warned about the world’s vulnerability to a crisis of such magnitude. 
Yet, even those experts could not have fully anticipated exactly the ways 
COVID-19 ultimately exploited the gaps in health security systems globally. 
If there is anything meaningful that emerged from the pandemic, it is 
the knowledge of where and how health systems struggled, where they 
performed well, and what must be done to prepare for future pandemics. 
This author speaks from experience as managing director of the Office of 
the COVAX Facility from the fall of 2020 through mid-2022.  The Access to 
COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (or ACT-A) was a global collaboration focused 
on accelerating the development, production, and access to vaccines. COVAX,"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/EnsuringEquitableSupplyOfVaccines.pdf|1|3ee93735b86a4c618f12653e0f3c4db0
"on accelerating the development, production, and access to vaccines. COVAX, 
the vaccines pillar of ACT-A, had the remit of facilitating access to potential 
COVID-19 vaccines to the most vulnerable everywhere, regardless of their 
income;3  to date, it has delivered nearly 2 billion doses of COVID-19 
vaccines to 146 countries across the world.4 It is a collaborative work of 
the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the World 
Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) 
and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance which co-managed COVAX. 
COVAX accomplished a great deal, and according to estimates from Imperial 
College London,  the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations on COVAX AMC 
participants included the prevention of an estimated 2.7 million deaths 
worldwide.5 It could have made even greater impact had certain conditions 
been met even before it was launched in 2020. To that end, one must heed 
three categories of lessons that emerged while dealing with the pandemic"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/EnsuringEquitableSupplyOfVaccines.pdf|1|6d3b267a64e4447380d861e2af2085b7

21puzzle—the procurement, distribution, and administration of COVID-19 
vaccines across countries.  
First, the world must be willing to take risks and make contingent 
financing available to ramp up rapidly as health crises emerge. Before 
the COVID-19 pandemic broke out, there was nothing in the world like 
COVAX. It began without any funding and with virtually no personnel. 
Unlike sovereign governments with sizeable spending power, global health 
organisations and other international development agencies could not take 
on the risk of paying billions of dollars in purchase orders for vaccines.6
It thus took COVAX several months to raise sufficient funds to secure 
early-purchase agreements with vaccine makers. Meanwhile, vaccine 
manufacturers gave priority to bilateral customers—typically, well-resourced 
sovereign governments—even months before it was clear which, if any 
of the vaccine candidates would earn regulatory approval.7 That, in turn, 
left relatively few doses available early on for COVAX to procure. More 
importantly, some countries imposed export bans on vaccines or vaccine 
ingredients manufactured on their shores to ensure they would have enough 
supply for their citizens.8
It is understandable that countries will do everything they can to place 
the health needs of their citizens first in a crisis such as COVID-19. This"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/EnsuringEquitableSupplyOfVaccines.pdf|2|7bb65fb349424e1db705103fc033b0df
"the health needs of their citizens first in a crisis such as COVID-19. This 
dynamic will not change. The question, therefore, is how the world can 
navigate this geopolitical reality. 
One way is to put in place now contingent funding that will be immediately 
deployable as soon as another crisis strikes. That will help global health 
agencies—like a future version of the COVAX Facility—mount an even more 
effective global response. 
Such funding must be flexible and agile. It will require mechanisms to 
constantly update working assumptions regarding epidemiology, policy 
recommendations, supply, demand, R&D, manufacturing, country-level 
challenges, and other factors, and for making at-risk investments for 
multiple scenarios. This funding should also include a proportion that could 
be used with a high-risk appetite to secure vaccines that are at any R&D 
stage, even with the risk of vaccine failure.9"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/EnsuringEquitableSupplyOfVaccines.pdf|2|b756f59ae9c846d4b8cd180fdab678a9
"21The Lessons of COVAXAnother lesson is related to the value of an innovative financing mechanism 
that COVAX created, called the pandemic vaccine pool (PVP), which ensures 
that there will be cash on hand to make rapid procurement of vaccines 
available, especially to lower-income countries—even in a scenario such as 
the one in 2020 where it was uncertain which of the vaccine candidates 
would get approval.  Likewise, COVAX pioneered other new innovations out 
of the crisis—such as indemnification and liability agreements and a ‘no-
fault compensation scheme’ that would lower the risks for manufacturers—
which were also critical to removing bottlenecks and speeding up the 
response-time during COVID-19. Mechanisms that allow fast response and 
sharing of risk during an emergency are important features of any future 
responses.  
Moreover, multinational trade-facilitation measures must be strengthened 
to allow for the free flow of vaccines, manufacturing supplies, and other 
life-saving equipment during health emergencies. There should be in place, 
for example, exemptions and waivers that allow agencies involved in the 
global health response to ship life-saving medical countermeasures and 
materials to low- and middle-income countries as well as into humanitarian 
situations exempt from any trade barriers.10
Second, it is now known that turning vaccines  i n t o  vaccinations  depends 
upon strong, reliable health systems.  That is, getting shots in people’s"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/EnsuringEquitableSupplyOfVaccines.pdf|3|71ad7c0227f24ca38c4803f7f8cf8f8e
"upon strong, reliable health systems.  That is, getting shots in people’s 
arms requires complete end-to-end solutions at the country level, backed 
by investments—from early R&D; scaling-up manufacturing; securing deals; 
consistent policy guidance; and setting up operational, logistical, regulatory, 
and legal frameworks further along the value chain. This applies not just 
to the vaccines themselves but also ancillary supplies, such as cold chain 
and safe injection equipment, international freight and logistics as well as 
in-country delivery requirements, including personal protective equipment 
for healthcare workers.11
Many countries that lacked this infrastructure strained to get doses 
to the people who needed them. To be sure, the challenge was less 
pronounced—though still serious—in many countries where organisations 
like Gavi and WHO had already provided significant resources over many 
years to help strengthen health systems (particularly primary health care),"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/EnsuringEquitableSupplyOfVaccines.pdf|3|2067070d62214af186e8acbe3592ef65
"22Accelerating Global Health: Pathways to Health Equity for the G20
23build cold chains that facilitated the widespread delivery of vaccines, and 
establish relations with all the many stakeholders who make immunisation 
programmes work. 
At Gavi, which has supported the improvement of lower-income countries’ 
routine immunisation programmes since 2000, the concern was that 
those efforts to vaccinate mostly children would flag significantly under 
the extra burden of delivering COVID-19 vaccines to other populations. It 
was unexpected, therefore, when many showed relatively little decline in 
routine immunisation. To be sure, their systems were pushed to the limit. 
Vaccinators, doctors and nurses were burned out. However, considering that 
while responding to the pandemic and having to deliver three times the 
number of vaccines compared with previous years, immunisation in Gavi-
implementing countries suffered declines of only 4 percent in 2020 and 
1 percent in 2021 and a near return to pre-COVID levels by the end of 
2022—there was a lot more resilience than expected.12 
Those many years of health system strengthening investments apparently 
paid off. But these countries will need more, especially when it comes to 
building out primary healthcare services, cold chain, vaccine track-and-
trace, human resources and data monitoring systems13 that reach all their 
citizens, especially those with the least access to healthcare."|data_input/OrfPathHealth/EnsuringEquitableSupplyOfVaccines.pdf|4|ce903a70fac544b9beac7468f519c9eb
"trace, human resources and data monitoring systems13 that reach all their 
citizens, especially those with the least access to healthcare. 
One step in that direction, for example, is the COVID-19 vaccine Delivery 
Support (CDS) which was time-sensitive funding based on country’s 
requirements across various areas, including service delivery, data and 
monitoring, and supply chain systems that Gavi helped put in place 
to deal with funding gaps for delivery and improve countries’ capacity 
to rapidly scale up COVID-19 vaccinations. In addition to that goal, in 
many countries the programme has also contributed to health system 
strengthening, including upscaled cold chain infrastructure, digitisation of 
health data, improved outreach capabilities, combined COVID-19 and routine 
immunisation deliveries, and expanded vaccine supply chain capacity. 
Somalia, for example, where targeted CDS investment saw the digitisation 
of its health systems, strengthening of the country’s cold chain capacity, 
and the training of health workers at the front of community engagement 
and support of risk communications for both COVID-19 vaccination and"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/EnsuringEquitableSupplyOfVaccines.pdf|4|54286a988fb7490d9a86d8da96b43249
"23The Lessons of COVAXroutine immunisation helped increase primary COVID-19 vaccine coverage 
from 5 percent at the beginning of 2022 to 41 percent by the end of the 
year.14 Gavi invested approximately US$1.3 billion in health systems in 
Gavi-implementing countries from 2021 to 2022.15
Moreover, it must be ensured that every country puts in place regulatory 
readiness, harmonisation, and policy development for pandemic preparedness. 
They must build access for the most vulnerable people—especially those 
who are chronically hard to reach—into the pandemic architecture. This 
should acknowledge that, despite best efforts, there will be disparities in 
countries’ readiness levels, infrastructure, and capacity in the event of 
another pandemic.16 The global community cannot shirk from the challenge 
of closing those gaps, as much as possible.   
Third, it is important to lower barriers to the equitable supply of vaccines—
such as vaccine nationalism, hoarding, and export bans.  The very idea of 
the COVAX Facility emerged from a desire to prevent a replay of what took 
place in 2009 during the H1N1 pandemic when better-resourced countries 
dominated nearly all the global supply of vaccines.17 Countries with little 
financial resources and without their own vaccine production capacity were 
left largely empty-handed.18 
To solve that problem, COVAX sought to pool demand for COVID-19 vaccines 
from lower-income economies as well as from wealthier nations. With"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/EnsuringEquitableSupplyOfVaccines.pdf|5|89bc1967110149bbbeeab91bd2716113
"To solve that problem, COVAX sought to pool demand for COVID-19 vaccines 
from lower-income economies as well as from wealthier nations. With 
pooled demand and funding, COVAX would ideally be in a better position 
to make large-scale investments. It could build a diverse portfolio of what 
was eventually 11 vaccine-candidates across four technology platforms (10 of 
which received regulatory approval for use). This was the largest portfolio 
secured by any buyer, making more than 4 billion doses available to 191 
countries that were part of COVAX.19 
In other words, COVAX would be able to compete with better-resourced 
countries for what would surely be a finite supply of vaccine doses. Dose 
domination by relatively few countries would not follow the pattern of the 
H1N1 vaccine."|data_input/OrfPathHealth/EnsuringEquitableSupplyOfVaccines.pdf|5|81a04b1247ef4f6586112345ee3284c6
"24Accelerating Global Health: Pathways to Health Equity for the G20
25The experience during COVID-19 and previous pandemics cries out for 
increased and geographically diversified vaccine manufacturing, particularly 
across the African continent. Africa has an eighth of the world’s population 
but only about 0.1 percent of the vaccine manufacturing capacity.20 There is 
much work that must and can be done to help those regions establish this 
essential infrastructure, not just for emergencies but for the production of 
routine vaccines during non-crisis times. To help regional production take 
root and grow, there must be support for technology transfer as well as 
demand-side financing to promote a sustainable diversified manufacturing 
base.21 
With this goal in mind, Gavi and the African Union Commission entered 
into a Memorandum of Understanding in May 2023 (with the cooperation 
of the Africa Center for Disease Control)22 to work together to stimulate, 
among other health advances, sustainable regional vaccine manufacturing in 
the continent. The endeavour includes 10 commitments to increase political, 
financial, and technical investments in immunisation programmes.23 
Another one of the biggest lessons was that critical to an effective global 
response is putting models in place that can ensure, long before the 
occurrence of a pandemic, that lower-income countries receive volumes of 
vaccine doses at the same time and in the same levels that high-income"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/EnsuringEquitableSupplyOfVaccines.pdf|6|b6c2a98b763a48c2aae8cda39b29ffaa
"occurrence of a pandemic, that lower-income countries receive volumes of 
vaccine doses at the same time and in the same levels that high-income 
countries do to stop the spread of variants. This will require increased 
standards for manufacturers’ transparency about their order books so 
that it is possible to determine—and correct— the supply inequities among 
countries. This will also require that contingent financing continues to be 
readily available to allow response to unexpected trends in the trajectory 
of the pandemic. Discussions on the use of available COVAX AMC funding 
is currently ongoing, with consideration on using part of the available PVP 
funding channelled to the procurement of new products, including variant-
containing vaccine boosters, based on country requirements. 
Discussions also focus on the implementation of the 2024–25 COVID-19 
programme approved by the Gavi board in June 2023.24 Equally important 
considerations include using these funds to prepare for other health 
emergencies, catching up from the effects of the pandemic, accelerating 
diversified manufacturing—all of which will be discussed further at the 
December board meeting of Gavi."|data_input/OrfPathHealth/EnsuringEquitableSupplyOfVaccines.pdf|6|3692203dde53471fb79f6b9dd7bf58aa

"13Among the most important lessons the world should learn from 
the COVID-19 pandemic is that being prepared—being ready to act 
urgently with the right technology, know-how and resources—can give the 
world a crucial head start in tackling a newly-emerging infectious disease 
outbreak.
With COVID-19, many countries and regions of the world were seriously 
deficient on many important epidemic and pandemic preparedness measures, 
putting them way behind the line. However, in one key aspect of the race 
against the novel viral threat—vaccine development—the world had put 
itself a few critical steps ahead by the time the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus 
emerged in 2020.
This was in large part a result of many years of studying other similar 
viruses, whereby scientists had the chance to develop and hone techniques 
to facilitate new vaccine designs. Research initially on respiratory syncytial 
virus (RSV)—a virus first identified in 1956 that can cause respiratory 
tract infections—and subsequently on the SARS coronavirus that emerged 
in China in 2003, then on the MERS coronavirus that was first reported a

"13A Global Vaccine Librarydecade later in Saudi Arabia, meant scientists had well-developed insights 
into these types of viruses and knew how to go about designing effective 
vaccines against them. 
Those decades of work allowed scientists to understand, for example, the 
importance of the spike protein of the coronavirus for the production of 
neutralising antibodies. They had also developed and refined techniques 
for manipulating the spike protein to make it more visible to the immune 
system and therefore more able to illicit a potent immune response.
In early 2020 when the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 emerged, drug 
developers were able to create new candidate vaccines at record speed.   
They pulled off the shelf previous research, data and knowledge on RSV, 
SARS and MERS virology, vaccinology and immunology, and tweaked it to 
figure out how to best tackle the novel threat. Therefore, despite never 
before having seen the COVID-19-causing virus, they were not reinventing 
the wheel in developing COVID-19 vaccines. Humanity had a head start.
Consider also the case of Mpox. Formerly known as monkeypox, Mpox 
is a contagious disease caused by a virus from a family called the 
orthopoxviruses—a viral family that also counts smallpox, cowpox and 
many other pox viruses among its members. When Mpox began to spread 
in 2022 in a far larger outbreak that reached more geographies, humanity 
had again put itself a few critical steps ahead. It was in the late 1800s"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/GlobalVaccineLibrary.pdf|1|eac4fb2d0ec3485093755074f08e0cb4
"in 2022 in a far larger outbreak that reached more geographies, humanity 
had again put itself a few critical steps ahead. It was in the late 1800s 
when vaccines against the highly deadly smallpox were developed, before 
being refined and ultimately deployed to greatest effect in the 1970s and 
1980s when smallpox became the first—and so far only—human disease 
to be eradicated. After this success, however, many governments remained 
highly concerned about the potential for the smallpox virus to be used one 
day as a weapon of bioterrorism. This led national and international health 
security bodies to decide to maintain stockpiles of smallpox vaccines. 
Fortunately, those smallpox vaccines also offer broad protection against 
other viruses in the orthopoxvirus family, including Mpox. When  Mpox case 
numbers ballooned into an epidemic of international emergency proportions 
in 2022, the bank of knowledge, data and vaccines that could help public 
health authorities curb the outbreak was significant. Again, humanity had 
a head start."|data_input/OrfPathHealth/GlobalVaccineLibrary.pdf|1|ac169d2f7ba94e499cac064424d51111

15What if humanity could get itself a similar head start against any viral 
threat—known or unknown, novel or re-emerging? What if we could get 
ahead of any infectious pathogen with the potential to cause a serious 
and deadly epidemic?  Doing that would give us a far better chance of 
winning the containment race against an emerging virus and of controlling 
a nascent pandemic before it is able to spread across the world.
A Proposed ‘One World Vaccine Library’
At the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), of which 
the authors of this essay are part, we have a concept for how the world 
could do just this—by creating and stocking a library of knowledge, data 
and prototype vaccines against every one of the viral families we already 
know have the potential to cause human disease outbreaks. CEPI calls this 
the ‘One World Vaccine Library’—a vaccine library for the whole world that 
will help the global community achieve greater health security by being 
better prepared to beat the next pandemic threat, wherever it emerges, and 
whatever form it takes.
Vaccines are among the most potent tools against pandemic threats and 
will be critical to any future response to dangerous and deadly outbreaks 
of infectious disease. The faster an effective vaccine can be developed and 
deployed, the faster it can be used to mitigate and potentially contain an"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/GlobalVaccineLibrary.pdf|2|45c5d935196b4e8ab17e7b96fcbf2818
"deployed, the faster it can be used to mitigate and potentially contain an 
incipient pandemic. This is why we need to work on getting those head 
starts against as many as possible of our potential opponents.
Getting ahead of any potential viral threat, known or unknown, can at first 
sound like an impossible task.  There are between 250 and 300 viruses 
from around 25 viral families that are already known to have the ability 
to infect people, and the world’s scientists cannot create new vaccines 
against every one of them, just on a chance that they might one day pose 
a deadly threat.  
Yet the beauty of a One World Vaccine Library is that we do not need to.  
As those several hundred viruses all come from just 25 families, scientists 
can take a viral-family-based prototype vaccine approach to preparing 
the world’s defences against them. They can gather knowledge, scientific"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/GlobalVaccineLibrary.pdf|2|d44f7d2a0db640ff9c3ff89ee5b3668c
"15A Global Vaccine Libraryinsights and research data on a selection of representative viruses from 
each family and create vaccines that target their most common threatening 
features. That way, the world will have a bank of detailed fundamental 
knowledge about the threats posed by these virus families.
As things currently stand, scientists have already made meaningful 
progress—proven safe and effective vaccines are available against scores of 
viruses that come from and represent at least 15 of the 25 virus families. 
For the One World Vaccine Library to be able to help the world respond 
at speed to a newly emerging threat, however, those vaccines will need to 
be transferred onto so-called rapid response platforms—technologies like 
mRNA platforms or viral vector platforms that can be rapidly scaled up to 
allow for hundreds of millions of doses to be produced within months if 
needed.
Beyond that, the library will need to be stocked with data and research and 
potential vaccine candidates against viruses that represent all the remaining 
families, and its sections on the most threatening virus families must be 
filled with as much preparatory work as possible. That way, new vaccine 
development will be faster and more efficient, saving precious time, and 
potentially lives, that would otherwise be at risk if new vaccines had to be 
started from scratch each time a pandemic threat looms.
Take the paramyxoviruses, for example. The paramyxovirus family includes"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/GlobalVaccineLibrary.pdf|3|ec6c0366c902440a8d382c1a5bfe0978

Take the paramyxoviruses, for example. The paramyxovirus family includes 
a number of well-known human disease threats, including measles and 
mumps, as well as several less well-known ones, such as Hendra and 
Nipah. 
If the aim is to make similarly fast—indeed, ideally, faster—progress 
against a future emerging novel paramyxovirus threat as was made in 2020 
with the novel coronavirus, the One World Vaccine Library’s paramyxovirus 
section should be stocked with as much research, data and technical 
knowledge about how to design and make effective vaccines against the 
known and closely related viruses in that family. 
In other words, the library will collate scientific knowledge and prototype 
rapid-response vaccine candidates for measles, mumps, Nipah, Hendra and"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/GlobalVaccineLibrary.pdf|3|b0476594560848e5a8e36df2397bc0ea

17other known paramyxoviruses. If and when a novel paramyxovirus emerges 
and begins to infect people in a fast-spreading outbreak, the library can 
be accessed for knowledge that can help rapidly create vaccines or other 
medical countermeasures to prevent that spread as much and as soon as 
possible.
An Ambitious Yet Achievable Global Endeavour
Building a One World Vaccine Library and stocking it to its fullest possible 
capacity is a substantial task and will require sustained investment of time, 
effort and money. Such a Library, however, will mean the fruits of human 
ingenuity—the benefits of scientific progress—can potentially be made 
available to all, whenever and wherever they are needed.   It will mean that 
when the next viral pandemic threat emerges—whether it is a known virus 
or a novel one—humanity will have the knowledge and the technology to 
develop vaccines and other medical defences far more swiftly than it has 
ever done before. 
Researchers assessing a new outbreak and the virus causing it, wherever 
and whenever it occurs, will be able within days and weeks to sequence 
its genome, match it against related viruses and select prototype vaccines 
from the library to develop and deploy new vaccines against the epidemic 
or pandemic threat.
CEPI’s current work includes prioritising the development and stocking 
of sections of the One World Vaccine Library for the virus families that"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/GlobalVaccineLibrary.pdf|4|752aaba01d014b229677ddfa9be7e095
"CEPI’s current work includes prioritising the development and stocking 
of sections of the One World Vaccine Library for the virus families that 
pose the greatest and most urgent threats to global health security. CEPI 
is engaging virus experts to systematically rank each family to assess 
its potential to spawn the next Disease X. For each family selected, 
the aim is to create vaccine candidates for at least one and potentially 
several different viruses, depending on the family’s complexity and genetic 
diversity. Vaccines in the library will be taken through preclinical and 
early-stage clinical testing to build vital knowledge about the safety and 
immunogenicity of both the platform and the antigens they target. The 
larger goal is to establish clinical proof of concept for the lead candidates 
in multiple families over the next five years."|data_input/OrfPathHealth/GlobalVaccineLibrary.pdf|4|2b40e9b8f0d24ea9bf8b24f342c9a7d1
"17A Global Vaccine LibraryThe ‘100 Days Mission’ and the Need for Speed
Creating and stocking a One World Vaccine Library is a critical enabler of 
CEPI’s 100 Days Mission, embraced by the G7 and the G20, to compress 
the development timeline for new vaccines against emerging disease threats 
to 100 days. Coupled with improved surveillance providing earlier detection 
and warning of potential viral disease threats, and with swift and effective 
use of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as testing, contact tracing 
and social distancing to suppress disease transmission, delivering an 
effective new vaccine within 100 days would give the world a real chance 
to extinguish the existential threat posed by a future Disease X pandemic 
virus. 
The head starts in these viral races—and there are sure to be ever more 
frequent ones in this era of novel epidemic threats—will come from having 
a One World Vaccine Library that is comprehensive and extensive and, 
crucially, immediately accessible to all nations and regions whenever they 
need it. As the bank of knowledge builds up in the library, so too, does 
the potential for scientists to significantly accelerate vaccine development 
against a wide and growing range of virus families over time.

Public health workers are the backbone of the public health system 
and a determining factor in the capacity for emergency preparedness 
and response. The COVID-19 pandemic tested and exposed the weaknesses 
in core public health capacities around the world,1,2 which are often the 
result of decades of underfunding and lack of political commitment to 
public health.3,4 Alongside the number of confirmed deaths from COVID-19, 
there was increased mortality and morbidity due to the severe disruptions 
in essential health services, including preventive care such as routine 
immunisation.5,6 The inadequate preparedness of many health systems to 
respond to disease outbreaks partly explains these outcomes.7 However, the 
limited availability of the health workforce was the critical bottleneck.8,9 
This was largely due to longstanding workforce shortages that were 
exacerbated by COVID-19 infections and deaths among health workers; the 
burden placed upon them, which resulted in mental health issues, including 
burnout; and poor working conditions.10,11

approach.14 Strengthening the quantity and quality of the national public 
health workforce capacity to deliver these EPHFs is essential15 and requires

In May 2021, the G20 and invited leaders, heads of international and 
regional organisations, and representatives of global health bodies gathered 
in Rome for the Global Health Summit that culminated in the Rome 
Declaration.18 This political declaration recognised the impacts of the 
pandemic, the reversal of public health gains, and the sacrifices from 
the health and care workforce. The Rome Declaration set out a global 
consensus which subsequently informed the G20 Italia Declaration of 
Health Ministers in September 2021,19 where investment in health systems 
and public health workforce strengthening was identified as a prerequisite 
for countries to improve future pandemic preparedness and response. The 
declaration affirmed the role of political consensus in strengthening the 
health workforce. It highlighted the need to protect workers and invest 
in their education, employment, and retention, including to strengthen 
multidisciplinary teams to better respond to future emergencies and deliver 
the essential functions in “health care system and preventive care”.20

multilateral investment is leveraged to strengthen public health workforce

Advancing ‘One Health’ for a  
Better World
Human health is interconnected with the ecosystem that consists 
of animals, plants, and the environment. As such, any health 
intervention should be integrative of these connecting factors. ‘One Health’ 
(OH) is a holistic approach that considers all the determinants of health, 
designed for disease prevention and control. It is a transdisciplinary 
approach that allows multisectoral collaboration and deals with antimicrobial 
resistance and the prevention and control of zoonoses and vector-, food- 
and water-borne diseases. 
Since 2022, the Quadripartite collaboration between the World Health 
Organization, Food and Agriculture Organization, United Nations Environment 
Programme, and World Organisation for Animal Health has been responsible 
for OH operations, guiding countries in planning and adapting strategies 
for addressing global health challenges. Implementing OH will enhance 
pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response, and will also enable the 
strengthening of domestic health systems, including in India."|data_input/OrfPathHealth/BridgingTheDivide.pdf|0|8cb396872001467fa610927f2b7ca3b1

49Deconstructing ‘One Health’
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines ‘One Health’ (OH) as 
“an integrated, unifying approach that aims to sustainably balance and 
optimize the health of people, animals, and ecosystems.”1 In addition to an 
individual’s characteristics and behavioural patterns, social, economic and 
physical environments are important determinants of health, and include 
a variety of factors such as water, air, animals, plants, housing, and 
jobs. Animal trade, agriculture, livestock farming, urbanisation, extractive 
industries, climate change, habitat fragmentation, and encroachment into 
wild areas are some of the factors that can impact human health. It is 
essential to consider the possible interactions of these factors with an 
individual’s health to achieve optimal health outcomes. Therefore, no health 
intervention can be designed and implemented with the consideration of the 
health sector alone. There should be multisectoral inclusivity in addressing 
any health-related issues. For example, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) 
cannot be addressed only through medical intervention and also requires 
the checking of antibacterial content in food and water. 
The OH concept encourages a collaborative, multisectoral, and 
transdisciplinary approach at the local, regional, national, and global levels.

51Medicines become ineffective when pathogens undergo structural changes 
as a result of increased drug exposure. Misuse or overuse of antimicrobials, 
multiplication of pathogens due to unhygienic water and poor sanitation 
processes, and inadequate infection prevention and control measures in 
hospitals and healthcare settings are some of the other factors that cause 
AMR. It also arises due to the use of antibiotics in the farming, livestock, 
and fisheries sectors, which enables pathogens infecting these animals to 
develop resistance. Close contact with these animals and the contamination 
of soil and water with these microbes exposes humans to these bugs.  
AMR makes treating infections difficult, leaving patients with limited 
treatment options, if at all. In such cases, managing serious infections in 
children and adults alongside any surgical intervention becomes a challenge. 
Indeed, the global health system is already exposed to drug-resistant 
Tuberculosis, HIV infections, and specific AMRs such as artemisinin-based 
combination therapy-resistance in malaria treatment, and antileprotic drug 
resistance. 
Zoonotic diseases
Over the past three decades, around 30 pathogens have been detected, with 
75 percent of them originating from animals, causing zoonotic diseases and 
contributing to about 60 percent of emerging infectious diseases globally.4"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/BridgingTheDivide.pdf|2|dbd06533e0f8426bb5c48add38e4a7af
"contributing to about 60 percent of emerging infectious diseases globally.4 
These diseases can be spread directly through the saliva, blood, urine, 
mucous, faeces, or body fluids of infected animals, or indirectly through 
contact with areas where animals live and roam as well as through 
contaminated objects or surfaces. 
Urbanisation and the destruction of the natural habitats of animals, illegal 
trade in wildlife, and wet markets increase the chances of interaction 
between animals, animal products and humans, thereby increasing the risk 
of zoonotic disease and contributing to zoonotic spillover. Recent disease 
outbreaks such as SARS, MERS, Ebola, Nipah, and avian influenza are 
examples of zoonotic infections being established in humans. It is important 
to ensure the hygienic and appropriate care of animals in the agriculture 
sector, and the safe handling of meat, eggs, dairy, and vegetables to avoid 
contamination to prevent outbreaks of food-borne zoonotic diseases."|data_input/OrfPathHealth/BridgingTheDivide.pdf|2|2f884a037acc49378eeae7a7fb414b1e
"51Advancing ‘One Health’ for a Better WorldAddressing zoonotic infectious diseases through an OH approach includes 
multiple actions:
• Raising awareness at all levels of society on prevention and risk-
reduction strategies.
• Investing in interdisciplinary approaches including OH perspectives. 
• Initiating research to explore the complex social, economic, and ecological 
dimensions of diseases; to assess risks and effective interventions; and 
to conduct cost-benefit analyses. 
• Regularly monitoring food systems, from farm to fork, and improving 
sanitary measures. 
• Implementing biosecurity and zoonoses-control measures for both 
industrial and disadvantaged smallholder farmers and herders.
• Supporting agricultural and wildlife habitats by managing landscapes 
and seascapes collectively. 
• Promoting agro-ecological methods of food production, mitigating waste 
and pollution, reducing further destruction of wildlife and habitat loss, 
and maintaining ecological connectivity. 
• Being mindful of biodiversity during government and private-sector 
planning, decision-making, and capacity building.5 
WHO, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the World 
Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) have already established the 
Global Early Warning and Response System for Major Animal Diseases to 
combat zoonoses to coordinate risk assessment and assist in early warning, 
prevention, and control of disease threats.6

53Water-borne diseases
Drinking or coming in contact with contaminated water causes water-borne 
diseases. Faecal-contaminated water is consumed by two billion people 
globally, which causes diseases such as cholera, dysentery, typhoid and 
polio. These diseases are responsible for around 485,000 deaths every year.8 
Food-borne diseases   
Over 200 diseases, ranging from diarrhoea to cancers, are caused by 
eating or drinking food contaminated with animal or human faecal matter, 
chemical substances such as unpasteurised (raw) milk, undercooked meat 
or eggs, and raw fruits and vegetables. Globally, 600 million people are 
affected by food-borne diseases, in which 420,000 die each year, resulting 
in 33 million healthy life years lost. Access to adequate safe and nutritious 
food is key to sustaining life and promoting good health.9 
Operationalising ‘One Health’ 
In April 2022, WHO, FAO, United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), 
and WOAH signed a memorandum of understanding for joint work on OH, 
forming the ‘Quadripartite Collaboration for One Health’. The Quadripartite 
is a strategic coordination mechanism that  aims to work towards  “a world 
capable of preventing, detecting, containing,  eliminating, and responding to animal  
and public health risks attributable to zoonoses and animal diseases with an  impact  
on food security through multi-sectoral cooperation and strong partnerships”.10 The"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/BridgingTheDivide.pdf|4|c28f27b2026346d8b1c25d3ac4fb35f1
"on food security through multi-sectoral cooperation and strong partnerships”.10 The 
One Health High-Level Expert Panel comprising 26 key international experts 
serves as the advisory group to the Quadripartite.  In late 2022, the group 
launched the first One Health Joint Plan of Action (2022-2026) to combat 
health risks at the human–animal–environment interface.11 
The Quadripartite has urged all countries to translate the OH approach 
into policy actions by promoting and increasing investment in intersectoral 
health governance. Countries are encouraged to adopt national OH policies, 
and create and exchange research on OH. Research institutions can be 
encouraged to work on improved genomic surveillance and data-sharing 
practices. Academic courses on OH can help train and equip a workforce."|data_input/OrfPathHealth/BridgingTheDivide.pdf|4|3eb3f6d6d48542a68f240d92f26cae0b
"53Advancing ‘One Health’ for a Better WorldSince the OH approach is similar to pandemic prevention and preparedness, 
resources allocated for the latter can also be utilised for operationalising 
OH. For instance, the World Bank’s US$10-billion fund for pandemic 
prevention can be used to implement the OH approach. Additionally, 
the UN’s high-level meeting on pandemic prevention, preparedness, and 
response (scheduled for September 2023) is an opportunity to integrate the 
OH agenda into the pandemic action plan.
According to the World Bank, between US$10.3-11.5 billion is needed 
annually to implement OH at a global scale.12 But the lack of centralised 
OH funding is a challenge, leaving relevant ministries in each country to 
assume the responsibility for implementing necessary actions and activities. 
This hinders the development of effective global OH strategies. 
WHO has identified several other existing gaps in the implementation of 
the OH approach.13 These gaps are evident in the following areas: 
• Databases and knowledge-sharing resources for effective information 
exchange.
• Showcasing best practice examples to encourage successful OH initiatives.
• Mapping and generating an OH workforce to strengthen capacity.
• Developing a model for an integrated OH surveillance system.
• Establishing routine and emergency coordination mechanisms with

One Health approach in India17
The Indian government initiated the OH approach under the office of 
the Principal Scientific Adviser (PSA) with the aim to increase pandemic 
preparedness and integrated disease control against priority diseases in 
both human and animal sectors. A supplementary goal includes establishing 
an early warning system built on an integrated surveillance system and 
response-readiness for endemic and emerging epidemic or pandemic threats. 
The country has also sought to implement integrated disease surveillance, 
build environmental surveillance systems, and develop robust outbreak 
investigation mechanisms. The OH mission will also focus on:
 •Targeted R&D  to develop critical tools such as vaccines, diagnostics, 
therapeutics, and other prevention tools, and to invest in developing 
novel disease surveillance and control methodologies.

animal diseases.18
In 2008, an attempt to operationalise the OH approach for zoonotic 
disease control and prevention identified the barriers preventing effective 
cross-sectoral collaboration on disease control.19 These included a lack 
of supportive policies, conflicting departmental priorities and limited 
institutional capacities. A review of zoonotic policy documents revealed 
there is a lack of specific mechanisms or strategies to safeguard livestock 
health, and a lack of guidelines for promoting cross-sectoral action. It also 
revealed a lack of clarity and inadequate information regarding engagement 
in the animal and forest sectors. This study found that implementing the 
OH approach in India requires contextual adaptation based on the underlying 
sociopolitical, institutional, and cultural contexts.20  
Given India’s diverse context, the way forward involves developing strategies 
that focus on fostering existing informal interpersonal relationships and 
collaborations between different sectors to successfully adopt the OH 
approach. It also requires intersectoral coordination at all levels, including 
the veterinary workforce, academic institutions, and the local or grassroots 
population. For instance, to conduct the SARS-CoV2 vaccine trial, the Tamil 
Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University signed a pact with the"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/BridgingTheDivide.pdf|7|95e9919de1de4544bc48124bd30a8a42

Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University signed a pact with the 
Tamil Nadu Dr MGR Medical University for conducting joint academic and 
research activities. Similarly, during an outbreak investigation in Punjab, 
community health workers, non-government organisations, auxiliary nursing 
midwives, accredited social health activists (or ASHAs) and village leaders 
actively participated in efforts to address vaccine hesitancy.21 
Conclusion 
Implementing the OH approach will enhance pandemic prevention, 
preparedness, and response. It will also strengthen systems and cross-
sectoral capacities, allowing for the co-design and implementation of 
inclusive and equitable multi-level workplans and strategies in line with 
OH principles. It is essential to develop, disseminate, and utilise improved

communication and transportation to healthcare and entertainment, 
technology has redefined how we live, work, and interact. Its omnipresence 
is reshaping societal norms, revolutionising various sectors, and propelling 
us into the future.
Through improvements in diagnostics, treatment, and patient care, 
technological advancements have had a profound impact on healthcare. 
Medical devices, telemedicine, electronic health records, and artificial 
intelligence (AI)-driven diagnostics have transformed healthcare delivery by 
making it more precise, efficient, and accessible. Wearable devices and health 
apps have empowered individuals to monitor and manage their well-being 
proactively. Technology has also played a crucial role in advancing medical 
research, discovering new treatments, and improving overall healthcare 
outcomes. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the world witnessed the 
exponential growth of digital health."|data_input/OrfPathHealth/BuildingResilientDigitalHealthIndia.pdf|0|d2a4917ce8cf48d69608d55e8bdeefd7
"83Building a Resilient Digital Health Ecosystem in India Digital Health Landscape in India
Given India’s massive population, providing equitable access to healthcare 
services to all is an important agenda. By harnessing the power of 
technology, digital health can effectively address these challenges and 
ensure that healthcare services are accessible even in the remote regions. 
Patients can use digital platforms for convenient access to care. Digital 
platforms therefore bridge gaps and improve healthcare delivery across the 
nation.
In line with the ‘Digital India’ initiative and the vision to create 
interoperable and standardised electronic health records across the country, 
the Indian government  notified the Electronic Health Record1 standards in 
2016. The National Health Policy2 (2017) envisages the creation of a digital 
health technology ecosystem  that serves the needs of all stakeholders and 
improves efficiency, transparency, and citizens’ experiences across public 
and private healthcare.
Over the recent years, India has made progress in digital healthcare 
delivery, as demonstrated in national health programmes such as the 
Hospital Management Information System, Online Registration System, the 
national tuberculosis elimination (Ni-kshay) programme, Mother and Child 
Tracking System, Mera Aspataal  (My Hospital, a patient feedback system), the 
Health Management Information System, the Integrated Health Information"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/BuildingResilientDigitalHealthIndia.pdf|1|e645ea793f2148328e415470d8fad8f1

for secondary and tertiary care hospitalisation to the over 120 million 
crore poor and vulnerable families that comprise the bottom 40 percent 
of the Indian population.
These initiatives aim to scale up a wellness-oriented approach instead 
of an illness-focused one—a key step towards achieving universal health 
coverage (UHC) through patient data portability across primary, secondary, 
and tertiary levels. This essentially translates into an environment where 
all people can obtain health services anywhere in the country without 
suffering financial hardship or excessive indirect costs. 
Achieving such scale requires us to rethink the core technology backbone 
of our system and leverage cutting-edge digital solutions to tackle the 
challenge. However, it is also felt that all these efforts need to converge into 
a single framework to achieve interoperability of data, which would benefit 
both policymakers for decision-making and patients with effective services 
at the time of need. In response, the government developed the National 
Digital Health Blueprint as a framework for the efficient implementation of

the ABDM ecosystem.
ABDM has accelerated the participation of various stakeholders of the 
healthcare ecosystem and ensured deployment of patient-centric policies—
resulting in cashless care with improved access to ensure protection

The India government not only focused on the management of the pandemic 
through various activities but also formulated innovative solutions to ensure 
the continuity of health services across the spectrum. It has followed a 
‘whole of government, whole of society’ approach to battle the pandemic 
by engaging subnational and local governments, civil society organisations,

9293Lessons from 
India’s Digital Public 
Infrastructure 
Transformation 
Sameer Kanwar and Varun Kumar
In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, many countries are 
striving to establish and strengthen digital public infrastructure (DPI) 
to harness the transformative power of technology to benefit citizens. India 
has emerged as a noteworthy example by successfully using technological 
advancements to create robust DPI. It has implemented various initiatives 
that mobilise technology for inclusive growth, economic development, and 
improved governance. Countries around the world can learn from India’s 
experience and achievements to initiate similar digital transformations.
Through the Digital India programme, India is seeking to digitally equip 
citizens with access to all government services by improving internet 
connectivity and developing online infrastructure. This encompasses three 
key areas: (a) establishing a secure digital infrastructure; (b) successfully 
delivering digital services; and (c) ensuring that every citizen has access 
to the internet. India has also seen an increase in the number of digital 
technology users, with an estimated 750 million smartphone users,  and a 
projected one billion users by 2025.1 This increase has generated demand 
for a centralised digital architecture that functions as a single enterprise."|data_input/OrfPathHealth/LessonsIndiaDigitalHealthTfn.pdf|0|f1acb3a152d842edb93b59c44e1a1a29
"93Lessons from India’s Digital Public Infrastructure Transformation 
93In 2018, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) 
created the India Enterprise Architecture (IndEA) framework1 for the adoption 
of a whole-of-government enterprise architecture by central ministries, 
state departments, and public sector enterprises. Built with a focus on 
performance, IndEA offers open standards to promote interoperability 
and supports decentralisation. At the same time, it supports both new 
(greenfield) and legacy (brownfield) e-governance initiatives. The emphasis 
of the IndEA initiative is to enable “One Government – a government 
that is least visible but is effective” by implementing the concept of 
“virtualisation of departments” to activate synergy.2
Growing digitalisation will lead to the increased generation of data, 
and consequently, data protection and ownership must be addressed at 
the outset. The  Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture (DEPA)  
framework, introduced in 2020, seeks to ensure user control over data. 
DEPA suggests measures for consent-governed and secure data-sharing 
with third-party institutions. Controlled by consent managers, only relevant 
user data is plugged in to any private ecosystem and there is no need 
to set up bilateral databases.3 This empowers citizens with ownership and 
control over their own data and how it is shared. 
While DEPA has been flexibly applied in multiple sectors, it has been"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/LessonsIndiaDigitalHealthTfn.pdf|1|844ace5971524f39856818d72304f7c9

While DEPA has been flexibly applied in multiple sectors, it has been 
particularly well-used as a techno-legal solution in the finance sector. 
Since DEPA empowers individuals to securely share their financial data 
with banks, insurers, investors, and other stakeholders, its first immediate 
benefit has been to encourage competition among private players. 
Individuals and small businesses are now able to get loans, insurance, and 
other financial products at competitive rates, just by using their digital 
footprint. In practice, DEPA works closely with the many layers of India

Network to facilitate lending. India Stack has enabled the country to build 
its digital infrastructure, especially in establishing a design to improve 
private sector service delivery, and has served as India’s digital library, 
housing several digital global goods and offering learnings to the world.
Over the last decade, India has taken landmark steps to set in motion its 
vision of becoming an inclusive digital economy. This includes establishing"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/LessonsIndiaDigitalHealthTfn.pdf|1|2744d84fd22b428182e2ad368b01f58e

95robust DPI and the facilitation of digital governance by streamlining 
roles, accountability, and change management. This encompasses various 
components, including digital identification systems, digital payments 
systems, and digital service delivery platforms. 
Pillars of Digital Public Infrastructure in India
The foundation: Aadhaar5
India's Aadhaar programme, a biometric and face authentication-based 
digital identification system, has revolutionised identity verification 
and service delivery in the country. Aadhaar has provided a unique 
identification number to over 1.3 billion residents of India, enabling access 
to essential services such as government subsidies, bank accounts, and 
mobile connections. It has enabled the government to streamline service 
delivery and eliminate duplication by providing a single digital identity 
across multiple sectors. The world can learn from India's approach in 
implementing a centralised, secure, and inclusive identification system, that 
has facilitated interoperability across service delivery platforms, both public 
and private.
Driving financial inclusion: Unified Payments Interface6

created a platform that enables instant money transfers between bank 
accounts. It offers a smartphone-based interface to support seamless, 
interoperable, and real-time payments, available on the go. UPI has not only 
transformed the way individuals transact but has also provided a significant 
boost to the growth of the digital economy. Countries can gather important 
lessons from India's experience in fostering a competitive and interoperable 
payment ecosystem, which has led to increased financial inclusion, reduced 
reliance on cash, and enhanced transparency in transactions.

digital economy will grow to US$500 billion by 2025, with the potential 
to increase to US$1 trillion.8 In 2021, India had 48.6 billion real-time 
payments, as compared to 18.5 billion in China and 8.7 billion in Brazil.9 
This is indicative of the ease with which the Indian population has adopted 
digital platforms for making payments even if the average value of such 
payments may be rather low.
Efficient welfare delivery: Direct Benefit Transfer10
India's Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) programme is aimed at eliminating 
potential leakages in the physical delivery of financial benefits and ensuring 
an efficient transfer of welfare to the right beneficiaries. By leveraging 
digital payment systems, benefits are directly credited to the beneficiaries’ 
bank accounts, reducing corruption, eliminating middlemen, and improving 
transparency in the transfer of subsidies.11 The enablers for DBT in India 
are the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana, the Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile 
Yojana, and nearly 312 other schemes from 53 ministries across all states 
and union territories. More than INR 24,800 billion has been transferred 
through the DBT programme since 2013, with INR 6,300 billion transferred 
in FY 2021-22 alone. On average, more than 9 million DBT payments were 
processed daily in FY 2021-22.12

97Creating a digital ecosystem: Technology access and innovation
India has created a vibrant digital ecosystem that fosters innovation 
and entrepreneurship. Initiatives like Startup India15 a n d  M a k e  i n  I n d i a16 
have encouraged the growth of technology start-ups and attracted global 
investments. India has nurtured a conducive environment for technology 
and innovation through policy reforms, access to funding, and incubation 
support. Managed by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal 
Trade under the commerce ministry, the Startup India initiative has helped 
introduce various programmes that support entrepreneurs and create a 
healthy start-up ecosystem. Similarly, the ‘Make in India’ initiative has 
incentivised the development, manufacture, and assembly of products in the 
country, and has thus boosted partnerships, investments, and innovations. 
Growing digital literacy and inclusion in harnessing the benefits of 
technology has also been crucial achievements for the country. India's 
experience underscores the importance of widespread access to affordable 
internet connectivity, digital skills training, and tailored initiatives for 
marginalised communities. Initiatives like BharatNet,17 which aims to 
connect over 250,000 local rural bodies with high-speed internet, and the 
Common Service Centers,18 which provide access to government services in"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/LessonsIndiaDigitalHealthTfn.pdf|4|014f9ea7e74046c3a199e084f6657655

training programmes offered through government-supported bodies like 
the National Skills Development Centre19 and the National Institute for 
Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development,20 other private training 
institutes and online platforms have significantly contributed to digital skill 
building among citizens, both in urban and rural settings. By prioritising 
digital literacy and inclusion, countries can bridge the digital divide and 
empower their citizens to participate fully in the digital age.

"97Lessons from India’s Digital Public Infrastructure Transformation Ecosystem collaboration
India's success in digital service delivery can be attributed to strong 
collaboration between government agencies, industry leaders, startups, 
academia, and civil society organisations. This collaborative approach 
has fostered innovation, shared expertise, and effective implementation. 
India’s G20 presidency has further drawn attention to the importance 
of collaboration, with initiatives like the Global DPI Summit21 allowing 
a close agreement between partners (and non-partners alike) on the 
common principles and design aspects of DPIs. By bringing together all the 
stakeholders, the Indian government has created a collaborative environment 
for developing and implementing digital public infrastructure projects.
Industry players have contributed their expertise, resources, and technological 
innovations to build and maintain the required infrastructure. Similarly, 
collaborations with academic institutions and research organisations have 
aided innovation and helped address technical and policy challenges. Public-
private partnerships and international collaborations have further supported 
knowledge exchange, best practice sharing, and access to resources and 
funding.
The Indian government has been able to promote such an ecosystem 
collaboration by establishing platforms (such as, India Stack), forums (for"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/LessonsIndiaDigitalHealthTfn.pdf|5|3d69704c07bc45b798128faaee87c3c6
"The Indian government has been able to promote such an ecosystem 
collaboration by establishing platforms (such as, India Stack), forums (for 
example, India Stack Knowledge Exchange Forum, 202222), and regulatory 
frameworks (IndEA and DEPA) that encourage active participation, 
information sharing, and coordination between different stakeholders. 
These collaborations prioritise interoperability, data privacy, security, and 
scalability to build a robust and sustainable DPI in the country.
Scalability and inclusion
India's experience in scaling up its DPI demonstrates the significance 
of inclusivity, with the most successful case being that of its digital 
identification system.  MeitY, in response to an unstarred question in the 
upper house of Parliament (in July 2022), said that out of the approximate 
projected population of 1.37 billion, around 1.27 billion held a live Aadhaar  
number.23 By ensuring accessibility and ease of enrollment for all citizens,"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/LessonsIndiaDigitalHealthTfn.pdf|5|a3bb7b5785614744bfc93dc4ac04eaf8

99including marginalised communities, India has achieved a notable level of 
inclusivity. While there are gaps in digital inclusion across demographic 
locations (55 percent share of urban telephone subscribers, as of December 
202224) and gender (11 percent gender gap in mobile ownership, 202325), 
the country is consistently invested in closing this difference.
India’s digital infrastructure has been created keeping in mind future 
needs and potential growth. With a quantum increase in users connected 
to the internet, the emergence of multiple types of intermediaries (digital 
media, e-commerce, and others), and the possible use of connectivity to 
cause harm or commit crimes cannot be ignored. Comprehensive measures 
need to be taken to prepare for the future. To check a potential DPI’s 
scalability even before introduction, significant emphasis has been placed 
on considerations like robust technology frameworks, interoperability, open 
Application Programming Interfaces, data management, and addressing 
infrastructure gaps. 
India’s journey is an example of how scalability and inclusion work 
together in building a resilient and equitable digital public infrastructure. 
Key strategies that have helped the country’s efforts to establish its 
infrastructure at scale are ensuring accessibility, promoting digital literacy

innovation, the country has implemented robust regulatory measures to 
ensure the security and integrity of transactions.

to engage in policy discussions and regulatory consultations has helped 
in understanding their needs and concerns, thus informing the adoption 
of balanced regulatory policies. Recognising the fast-paced nature of the 
digital landscape, Indian regulators have also shown agility in updating and 
adapting regulations. Recent policy measures like the introduction of the 
Digital Personal Data Protection Bill 2022,26 which restricts the processing 
of personal data until after the individual’s consent has been recorded, and 
the presentation of the Digital India Act 2023,27 to set up global standard

2829Antibiotics have revolutionised modern medicine by reducing 
morbidity and mortality caused by bacterial infections. However, 
the overuse and misuse of antibiotics has accelerated the development of 
antibiotic resistance, making once-treatable infections increasingly difficult 
to manage.1 Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a grave global health crisis, 
posing significant challenges to achieving health equity on a global scale. 
In 2019 alone, bacterial AMR was directly responsible for 1.27 million 
deaths worldwide.2 If left unchecked, this is predicted to cause a staggering 
10 million deaths by 2050,3,4,5 u n d e r l i n i n g  t h e  u r g e n t  n e e d  f o r  a c t i o n .  
An increase in AMR will significantly impact the global economy and is 
expected to push an additional 24 million people into extreme poverty by 
2030.6 Although reliable estimates from developing nations remain limited, 
perhaps due to inadequate surveillance, the burden of AMR is suspected 
to be highest in low-income countries. Unless suitable interventions are 
implemented, certain susceptible bacterial pathogens will eventually become 
resistant to antimicrobials, thereby rendering treatments ineffective.7 This 
essay explores the multifaceted nature of AMR and its impact on healthcare 
systems and patient outcomes. The focus is on accelerating efforts to

"29The Battle Against Antimicrobial Resistance
29Understanding Antimicrobial Resistance
The emergence of AMR impedes the prevention and/or treatment of 
persistent infectious diseases. Although a number of measures have been 
initiated at the global, national, and regional levels, AMR persists.8 To 
effectively combat AMR, it is essential to comprehend its fundamental 
aspects. AMR refers to the ability of microorganisms, such as bacteria, 
viruses, fungi, and parasites, to withstand the effects of antimicrobial drugs. 
The development of resistance is part of the natural biological evolution as 
this is part of the defence system of microorganisms. Resistance can be 
inherent (i.e. no target for the antibiotic) or it can arise through various 
mechanisms, including genetic mutations, horizontal transfer of resistance 
genes between microorganisms, target modification, membrane permeability 
alteration, drug modification, and antibiotic efflux. Exposure to antimicrobials 
accelerates the generation of resistance by increasing rates of mutation 
and exchange of genetic resistance mechanisms as well as the killing of 
susceptible microorganisms (including many bacteria of the normal flora), 
thereby giving resistant microorganisms a competitive advantage (also 
known as ‘selection’). Resistance affects all types of antimicrobial agents, 
including antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, and antiparasitic drugs. There"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/TheBattleAgainstAntimicrobialResistance.pdf|1|4c09cfa7a92c4c6f91015c4bc12ca169

are five key factors that contribute to the rise of AMR (see Figure 1).

31a) Inadequate infection prevention and control: The spread of AMR is 
closely linked to the ability of bacteria and other microorganisms to 
rapidly multiply and spread their population through various vectors/hosts. 
Poor hand hygiene, improper disinfection and sterilisation practices, and 
inadequate sanitation can lead to the rapid spread of these drug-resistant 
pathogens. Strict adherence to infection control measures can lower the 
occurrence of hospital-acquired infections.9 Therefore, appropriate measures 
need to be taken to enhance the existing infection prevention framework and 
reduce the risk of the spread of AMR. A significant hurdle in implementing 
infection prevention and control (IPC) practices, especially in low- and 
middle-income countries (LMICs), is the presence of adequately-trained 
human resources. To address this, institutions such as the World Health 
Organization (WHO) and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
have developed training modules, while the Infection Control Academy 
of India (IFCAI) has developed a diploma course to build the capacity of 
infection preventionists.

pressure on microbes due to the use of antimicrobial drugs, social and 
administrative factors also contribute to, and exacerbate the emergence of"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/TheBattleAgainstAntimicrobialResistance.pdf|2|f264cfbdf5374cb18f41be2df1db4bc9
"pressure on microbes due to the use of antimicrobial drugs, social and 
administrative factors also contribute to, and exacerbate the emergence of 
AMR. One of the contributing factors is the availability, in many countries, 
of antimicrobials through over-the-counter (OTC) sales without requiring 
prescriptions. Furthermore, the inappropriate prescription of antibiotics by 
physicians contribute to the overuse of antibiotics. A study conducted by 
WHO highlighted that a significant proportion of antimicrobials prescribed 
in outpatient departments of various hospitals were unnecessary or 
inappropriate.10 Rampant use of antibiotics in the livestock sector, pressure 
from patients to be prescribed an antibiotic for immediate relief from 
symptoms, self-medication, and the discontinuation of antibiotic course 
after relief from symptoms—all worsen drug resistance in pathogens.11,12 
New legislation and the enforcement of existing regulations to prevent the 
OTC sale of  antimicrobials is crucial, as are stricter antibiotic prescription 
and consumption measures.

antimicrobial drug development process, from discovery to market entry, takes 
an average of eight to 12 years. Although advancements in computational"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/TheBattleAgainstAntimicrobialResistance.pdf|2|b25025b426a4481fb8034389f7d5521c
"31The Battle Against Antimicrobial Resistancechemistry and artificial intelligence (AI) have aided in drastically cutting 
down the timelines for the discovery of new antimicrobials, the in vitro 
and in vivo trials take time. Even after such laborious efforts, bacteria 
swiftly develop resistance to these antibiotics. Quicker and more efficient 
antibiotic testing and approval pipelines need to be established to combat 
AMR.13  
Recent advances in antimicrobial discovery—including the repurposing 
of existing drugs, exploration of natural products, employing alternate 
treatment strategies, the use of computational approaches for drug design, 
interdisciplinary collaborations, and the integration of new technologies may 
help in accelerating the discovery process14 a n d  i n  t h e  m i t i g a t i o n  o f  A M R .
Despite the recent advantages, investment in antibiotic research and 
development remains limited, resulting in a clinical antibacterial pipeline 
that is insufficient to address the emergence and spread of AMR infections. 
In 2021,15 there were only 77 antibacterials in the clinical pipeline that target 
WHO priority pathogens (Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter and P s e u d o m o n a s ) 
including tuberculosis.16 Of these, 45 are traditional antibacterial agents and 
32 are non-traditional. Of the 45 traditional antibiotics, 27 are reported 
to be active against the WHO bacterial priority pathogens, 13 against"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/TheBattleAgainstAntimicrobialResistance.pdf|3|d6a0fa9223a74b6bb573ddaa0d4a0b34
"32 are non-traditional. Of the 45 traditional antibiotics, 27 are reported 
to be active against the WHO bacterial priority pathogens, 13 against 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and five exclusively against Clostridium difficile. 
Only six of the 27 antibacterials targeting the priority pathogens fulfil at 
least one of WHO’s four innovation criteria (i.e., absence of known cross-
resistance, new class of drug, new target site, and new mode of action).17 
However, a robust pipeline of novel antibiotics is critical to tackling the 
increasing emergence and spread of AMR. The Global AMR R&D Hub 
and WHO18 reported on the progress and challenges for incentivising the 
development of new antibacterial treatments to tackle the emerging threat 
of AMR. The return on investment for new antibiotics fails to cover the 
costs of their development, manufacturing, and distribution.19 As a result, big 
pharmaceutical companies have exited the antibiotic market, and companies 
remaining in the space (often small or micro biotech firms) face challenges

33Innovative financing mechanisms play a crucial role in addressing the 
lack of financial incentives for the private sector to develop, test, and roll 
out new antimicrobials. One potential solution is the implementation of 
advance market commitment–type investments, such as those undertaken 
by organisations like DNDi (Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative), CEPI 
(Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations), and Gavi (Global Alliance 
for Vaccines and Immunization).
Under this model, governments pool funding to support manufacturers 
and the private sector in creating antibiotics, thereby reducing innovation 
risks and ensuring equitable pricing and access. This approach incentivises 
private-sector investment, overcomes financial barriers, and contributes to 
the fight against AMR, securing effective treatments for all.
d) Poor diagnostic capacity: Accurate and timely diagnostics are critical for 
identifying and managing infectious diseases effectively. Poor diagnostic 
capacity can lead to delayed or inappropriate treatment, increased morbidity, 
mortality, and spread of infectious diseases, including outbreaks. Poor 
diagnostics encompass several aspects, including limited access to diagnostic 
technologies, inadequate laboratory supplies and equipment, poor quality of 
chemicals and equipment, absence of reliable quality assurance systems,"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/TheBattleAgainstAntimicrobialResistance.pdf|4|a6e0c242b2ce4ecabcca7b5e2a13432e
"technologies, inadequate laboratory supplies and equipment, poor quality of 
chemicals and equipment, absence of reliable quality assurance systems, 
limited access to reference laboratories, inadequate infrastructure, lack of 
trained personnel, and delays in obtaining test results.20 Poor diagnostic 
capacity is one of the biggest challenges of the health sector in developing 
countries.21 Lack of timely diagnostics is also a challenge in vulnerable 
populations in high-income countries (HIC). Therefore, improving diagnostic 
capacity is essential, especially in LMICs, as is ensuring equitable access to 
diagnostics for vulnerable populations to enhance the quality and efficiency 
of healthcare delivery and for achieving the global health goals of reducing 
the burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases.22
Innovations Related to AMR
a) Exploration of alternative therapies: Alternate ways of treatment

"33The Battle Against Antimicrobial Resistancepostbiotics”25 rather than antibacterial agents alone, could be an alternate 
way to reduce the use of antimicrobials. 
b) Streamlined approval of new antimicrobials: Efficient and streamlined 
clinical trial processes are crucial for expediting the development timeline 
of new antimicrobials, including regulatory processes and innovative 
trial designs, such as adaptive dose-ranging studies and seamless phase 
transitions. This calls for better collaboration between regulatory agencies, 
researchers, and industry stakeholders to establish harmonised protocols, 
reduce administrative burden, and expedite patient recruitment, leading to 
faster completion of clinical trials.26
c) Repurposing of existing drugs:  Drug repurposing, or identifying new 
therapeutic applications for existing drugs offers another strategy to 
expedite antibacterial production. By leveraging the extensive knowledge 
and safety profiles of approved drugs, researchers could bypass certain 
preclinical and early clinical development stages, significantly reducing the 
overall timeline. Repurposing can be achieved through in-silico analyses, 
high-throughput screening, and exploring drug libraries, aiming to identify 
existing drugs with potential antibacterial activity.27
d) Harnessing the power of AI:  Machine learning (ML) and AI offer 
possibilities to accelerate drug repurposing in several ways, including the"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/TheBattleAgainstAntimicrobialResistance.pdf|5|eef5aa9b8739411b810009a682c605ea
"d) Harnessing the power of AI:  Machine learning (ML) and AI offer 
possibilities to accelerate drug repurposing in several ways, including the 
detection of the relationships among various biological components (such as 
genes, proteins, diseases, and drugs) and through the analysis of molecular 
fingerprints of compounds. Furthermore, neural network-based approaches 
can be trained to learn the patterns and properties of fingerprints, enabling 
prediction of drug activities and identifying potential drug candidates.28
AI can also be harnessed to streamline the diagnostic process. An academic–
industry collaboration in India (between Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher 
Learning, IFCAI and SCIINV Biosciences Private Limited) has developed 
AMRx™  , an AI/ML-based culture-free prediction system in the context of  
urinary tract infections. It is a clinical decision support system to improve 
empirical antibiotic prescriptions and to reduce unnecessary laboratory

35e) Collaborative research and funding initiatives: Global efforts are urgently 
needed to address the complex elements of AMR. These include coordinated 
leadership at the global, regional, and national level, involving diverse 
government agencies, academia, practitioners, and industry.29,30  Recognising 
the spread of AMR, WHO, the Food and Agriculture Organization, the United 
Nations Environment Programme, and the World Organisation for Animal 
Health have formed the Quadripartite to promote a ‘One Health’ approach31 
that aims to align actions across the human, animal, and environmental 
sectors. Several initiatives are ongoing, and 170 countries have developed 
national action plans (NAPs). However, only 10 percent of these plans are 
fully costed. Converting the NAPs to concrete AMR mitigation actions has 
proved to be difficult, including in the LMICs. 
In response, Denmark initiated the establishment of the International Centre 
for Antimicrobial Resistance Solutions (ICARS) to support these countries 
with funding and expertise to develop evidence-based, context-specific 
and cost-effective solutions that can be scaled to establish sustainable 
AMR mitigation. The AMR Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPTF) was launched 
in 2019 by the Quadripartite members to catalyse the implementation of 
One Health NAPs and to provide effective leadership and coordination of"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/TheBattleAgainstAntimicrobialResistance.pdf|6|8c316bb5722c4d8d86175a03d060beff

R&D Hub in Berlin is promoting collaboration and coordination of research 
and development on AMR, and is cataloguing the present funding in AMR 
R&D to provide the landscape of present funding for future prioritisation. 
Organisations such as CARB-X, Global Antibiotic Research & Development 
Partnership (GARDP), and the AMR Action Fund work to stimulate drug 
discovery and equitable access. To solve the market failure for antimicrobials, 
new models for financing the development of novel antimicrobials, where 
countries pay for the accessibility of drugs, are currently being explored.32

37Conclusion
AMR is an ongoing and evolving pandemic that impacts LMICs and 
vulnerable populations in HICs the hardest. This is aggravated by a drying 
pipeline of antimicrobials and the industry leaving the field of antimicrobial 
drug discovery due to lack of economic sustainability. The consequences of 
the AMR pandemic are already severe, but will become even more dire if 
not reversed. There is an urgent need for increased and focused action. Due 
to the complex nature of AMR, this effort needs to be multifaceted, both 
in reducing the circulation and spread of existing resistant microorganisms 
and in slowing the increase of novel resistance mechanisms. Key to this 
is lowering the overall use of antimicrobials (i.e. infection prevention), 
antimicrobial stewardship (including accessibility of affordable and timely 
diagnostics), and strengthening IPC and biosecurity procedures, all of which 
need to be carried out through the ‘One Health’ approach. This needs 
involvement at all levels and of all stakeholders, including civil society. 
Exploring alternative therapies such as bacteriophage therapy, repurposing 
existing drugs, harnessing the power of AI, and fostering collaborative 
research initiatives are key strategies in tackling AMR. These innovative 
approaches provide hope for the future, where a robust antibacterial 
pipeline can meet the challenges posed by evolving bacterial infections and"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/TheBattleAgainstAntimicrobialResistance.pdf|8|4232b39e033a479aa1395dd385b860ea

61This achievement demonstrates the potential of the G20’s collective 
commitment towards enhancing public health outcomes and underscores 
the importance of continued efforts to prioritise health equity between 
countries. There is still much to be done: within the group, there is an 
18.2-year difference in life expectancy between the highest and lowest 
achieving members. Imagine the life and health gains if all G20 countries 
levelled up.
The improvements in human health have been accompanied by an increase 
in healthcare spending in absolute terms. With the exception of India and 
Turkey, G20 nations saw a rise in the average healthcare expenditure as 
percent of GDP, from 6.8 percent to 8.5 percent between 2000 and 2019, 
or just above US$3,000 per capita.

There is recognition that investments in healthcare, overall, runs parallel 
to expansion in coverage of Universal Health Care (see Fig. 3). However, 
this coupling between healthcare spending and health outcomes is a topic 
of intense interest when discussing health finance in G20 countries. While 
increased healthcare expenditure often leads to improved health outcomes, 
this is not always the case and it is crucial to ensure that investments 
are directed effectively and efficiently. By adopting innovative financing 
mechanisms, G20 countries can optimise the impact of healthcare spending 
and achieve desired health outcomes for their populations. 
Persisting Out-of-Pocket Expenses
Despite progress, the issue of high out-of-pocket (OOP) expenses remains 
a significant concern in many G20 countries. OOP expenses often place 
a disproportionate burden on vulnerable populations, leading to financial 
hardships and limited access to healthcare.4 Embedded in the advocacy for 
health equity is the recognition that health disparities exist among different 
populations due to various factors such as socioeconomic status, race, 
ethnicity, gender, geographic location and access to healthcare services.5

63initiatives. As the COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated, no one is safe until 
everyone is, and even if primarily motivated by self-interest, there is an 
economic case (if not for reasons of equity) for uplifting the most vulnerable 
populations.
The efficiency of healthcare systems also varies greatly among G20 countries. 
While some economies have successfully implemented efficient and effective 
healthcare models, others continue to face challenges in delivering equitable 
care. The authors of this article examine the relationship between universal 
healthcare service coverage (UHC) and Out-Of-Pocket Expenses (OOPE) as a 
proportion of Current Health Expenditure for G20 countries (Fig. 4), reflecting 
targets 3.8.1 and 3.8.2 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals for Universal 
Health Care. 
UHC measures coverage of essential health services that include reproductive, 
maternal, newborn and child health, infectious diseases, non-communicable 
diseases and service capacity and access among the general and the most 
disadvantaged populations. Meanwhile, 3.8.2 highlights catastrophic OOP 
healthcare spending, usually defined as populations with household expenditure 
on health >10 percent or 25 percent of total household expenditure. The

North-West direction would be ideal as it highlights increased UHC 
with lower OOPE, i.e. better coverage at greater affordability. The most 
significant improvements are highlighted in green (China, India, Indonesia, 
Singapore). This article discusses efforts in Indonesia and Singapore that 
have contributed to these remarkable achievements. By examining diverse 
strategies, readers can gain insights into potential pathways towards 
achieving health equity within different national contexts, be they in 
developing or developed nations.  
Best Practices
Indonesia
Indonesia’s journey to UHC is a textbook case of adherence to expanding 
health insurance coverage and implementing social protection mechanisms. 
The landmark JKN National Health Insurance was implemented in 2014 
to provide access to healthcare for its population and today covers 
approximately 250M people.7 The JKN program covers all Indonesian 
citizens, including formal and informal sector workers, and those 
categorised as poor and near-poor, ensuring that everyone has access to 
essential healthcare services. It consolidates more than 300 risk pools and 
operates under a single-payer system, managed by the Social Security 
Agency for Health ( Badan Penyelenggara Jaminan Sosial Kesehatan  o r  B P J S ) .  
BPJS collects contributions, manages the insurance fund, and coordinates"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/EnsuringAccessToAffordableHealth.pdf|4|b4062701b5d347ce83cad737fb176357
"BPJS collects contributions, manages the insurance fund, and coordinates 
with healthcare providers. Participation for all eligible individuals is 
mandatory, and contributions are based on income and employment status, 
with the government subsidising the premium for the poor and near-
poor. The insurance scheme entitles every Indonesian to the same medical 
benefit package, decreasing OOPE from 47 percent to 34 percent in just 
four years.8 
Within this OOP spending, in LMICs (low- and medium-income countries) 
such as Indonesia, medicines typically account for 20-60 percent of total 
healthcare expenditure with nearly 90 percent of the population purchasing 
medicines through OOP payments.9 Managing drug pricing and procurement 
is thus a key lever for further managing costs and affordability. Indonesia"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/EnsuringAccessToAffordableHealth.pdf|4|b320f07f7cc04cf196f3f634b4508f39

65has implemented a generic medicine pricing policy where the retail price 
of generics cannot exceed the maximum retail price set by the MOH. 
A 2010 study across nine public hospitals, 64 private pharmacies, and nine 
NGO hospitals in four provinces in Indonesia, showed that the prices of 
Lowest Price Generic (LPG) and Innovator Brand (IB) medicines was lower 
in 2010 than in 2004, with declines ranging from 40 percent to 2200 
percent.10 This showed that generic medicine pricing policies have succeeded 
in lowering the price of medicines. Despite this success, however, there 
is wide variation in implementation as exemplified by the excess paid by 
patients compared to MOH set prices varying widely from 2 percent to 
600 percent. Even within countries, there is substantial opportunity to 
narrow the differences. More recently, the government has also embarked 
on working through state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to centralise drug 
procurement and leverage purchasing power, negotiating lower prices to 
further ensure availability of medications across facilities.
On the demand side, Indonesia has promoted the use of generics with 
public awareness campaigns to educate the public about their benefits. 
These campaigns aim to dispel misconceptions and increase confidence 
in the quality and efficacy of generic medications. Additionally, the"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/EnsuringAccessToAffordableHealth.pdf|5|6b7e7f21c99641d885aaabdde592722a
"These campaigns aim to dispel misconceptions and increase confidence 
in the quality and efficacy of generic medications. Additionally, the 
government has provided incentives for healthcare professionals to prescribe 
and dispense generic medications. These incentives may include financial 
incentives or recognition for healthcare providers who prioritise generic 
prescribing. Again, implementation has been varied. In an observational 
study at Kalisat District Hospital, doctor’s compliance in prescribing generic 
drugs reached 68 percent while the national standard in April 2013 reached 
90 percent.11 
Overall, in Indonesia, BPJS and various national policies have forged 
significant steps in achieving UHC. However, as highlighted above, uniform 
and consistent implementation remains a challenge. Beyond these, there 
are also additional efforts that Indonesia can undertake to improve UHC 
further. Whilst JKN has an extensive network of healthcare providers, 
including public and private hospitals, clinics and facilities, challenges 
exist due to disparities in healthcare infrastructure across the vast island 
archipelago, and despite co-payments by beneficiaries, the JKN also faces a"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/EnsuringAccessToAffordableHealth.pdf|5|839005dd18fd40a48a9e23aa520baa58

Expenditure and contribution compliance. At the same time, Indonesia can 
also improve primary care and manage spending and governance.12 
Singapore
Whilst Indonesia is rightly lauded as having the fastest growing insurance 
program in the world (with BPJS covering close to 91 percent of its 
population in less than 10 years),13 Singapore has had its 3M approach 
(Medisave - a compulsory health savings account, Medishield – catastrophic 
illness insurance and MediFund – a social security net for the indigent) 
initiated 30 years prior, in 1984. What has Singapore done in the past 
decade to continue to move the needle in improving UHC and affordability? 
Expanding capacity has been a priority. In 2009, there were approximately 
8,000 acute hospital and 9,000 nursing home beds in Singapore. Today, 
those numbers have grown to 12,000 and 17,000 beds, respectively, or 
a combined 70-percent increase in institutional places. With healthy 
economic and GDP growth, the Singapore government has been assiduously 
increasing healthcare infrastructure, particularly in the eldercare sector as 
it prepares to become the 2nd fastest aging economy in Asia outside of 
Japan. By 2030, one in every four Singaporeans will be above 65, and along 
with changing societal and family patterns, will require massive capacity"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/EnsuringAccessToAffordableHealth.pdf|6|cab8dbe7057d4de7995e3e7a9a909ac8
"with changing societal and family patterns, will require massive capacity 
to cater to the elderly who mostly live independently and require support 
with their daily activities. Singapore has tried to keep costs manageable for 
the eldercare sector by footing high land and building costs of residential 
nursing homes and then offering concessions through competitive bids for 
operators. Eligible seniors are means tested and substantial subsidies of up 
to 80 percent of monthly fees are extended. 
Widening coverage to become truly universal has been a highlight of 
the last decade. In 2015, MediShield was replaced by MediShield Life, a 
more comprehensive and universal health insurance scheme that extended 
coverage to all Singaporeans, including those with pre-existing conditions 
and older individuals who were previously excluded or had difficulty 
obtaining coverage. All citizens and permanent residents were automatically 
enrolled in the scheme with lifetime coverage. Whilst MediShield Life helps"|data_input/OrfPathHealth/EnsuringAccessToAffordableHealth.pdf|6|9b26e7c5228846a0ab6f8df2c92bd605

67to pay for large hospital bills and selected costly outpatient treatments such 
as dialysis and chemotherapy, Singaporeans also have access to CareShield 
Life, which is a long-term insurance targeted at severe disability, providing 
cash payouts for long-term care costs for life (and applicable towards 
nursing home fees). Both MediShield and CareShield premiums can be paid 
using Medisave, with needier beneficiaries able to benefit from top-ups by 
family members or occasionally, one-off government disbursements.   
Prudent and rational use of limited funds is a priority in Singapore, 
especially with increased investment. The visible, frontline expansion of 
services aside, the Ministry of Health has also been actively shoring up 
decision-making and support services for better health economics. The 
Agency for Care Effectiveness (ACE) was set up in 2015—subsuming the 
prior Pharmacoeconomic and Drug Utilization Unit (PEDU)—as an expanded 
health technology assessment (HTA) unit to support the MOH’s Drug 
Advisory Committee in making evidence-based recommendations for the 
public funding of drugs. Standardised HTA methods and processes have 
been developed in line with international best practices and since ACE’s 
establishment, subsidised medications are provided earlier within a drug’s

"establishment, subsidised medications are provided earlier within a drug’s 
life cycle and value-based pricing has led to more cost-effective prices 
being negotiated with pharma.14 However, bandwidth limitations and lack of 
skilled HTA practitioners impact ACE’s capacity to achieve greater impact. 
The cost positioning for Singapore was further improved when the public 
healthcare clusters banded together in 2018 to centralise procurement 
through the setting up of ALPS Healthcare. Touted as a supply chain 
partner, ALPS consolidates, negotiates and manages logistics for supplies 
for all public healthcare players—from primary to quarternary care and 
including the eldercare sector. ALPS’s coverage goes beyond pharmaceuticals 
to include consumables and even support services such as housekeeping 
and laundry. This is especially important given the small size of the 
domestic Singapore market and consolidation improves efficiency and more 
cost-effective procurement.  
Despite these cost-saving measures, Singapore has not escaped the

settings and providing care that is most appropriate for the individual and 
not necessarily just what is most advanced medically. 
As this article highlights the examples of Indonesia and Singapore, broad 
themes emerge in the approaches used in achieving universal health 
care. Expanding financial coverage is critical and with this, widening 
service accessibility, especially in primary care and judicious purchasing 
and effective procurement. Implementation is paramount and there is 
opportunity here for countries to learn and work better together. 
Particularly in Southeast Asia, where government procurement is 
significant and yet not entirely efficient, the region lacks cross-country 
learning opportunities. In the vein of RESYST (Resilient and Responsive 
Health Systems) and SPARC (Strategic Purchasing for Africa Resource 
Centre), international consortia focused on strategic purchasing, the

"Centre), international consortia focused on strategic purchasing, the 
South East Asia Regional Collaborative for Health (SEARCH)15 hosted 
by the National University of Singapore aims to review existing health 
purchasing mechanisms of all ASEAN countries and provide national and 
regional-level policy recommendations. This will be a meaningful step to 
educate policymakers and help countries overcome roadblocks to strategic 
purchasing.    
Beyond risk pooling, pricing and procurement, more efforts can be poured 
into strengthening primary care provision; there are additional opportunities 
from technology and digital modalities. Telehealth and insurtech, if devised 
and regulated appropriately, could allow the next step-change in improving 
access to healthcare, both within a dense urban city state like Singapore 
or a dispersed island nation such as Indonesia. The COVID-19 pandemic 
has shown the need and case for such services, and particularly for a 
developing nation like Indonesia, the vast proliferation of mobile services 
could pave the way for micro-insurance and insurtech to further improve 
affordability of healthcare services."|data_input/OrfPathHealth/EnsuringAccessToAffordableHealth.pdf|8|723242056cf44a109c21c203e36c671c
"68Accelerating Global Health: Pathways to Health Equity for the G20
69The journey to UHC and improving health equity is an ongoing endeavour. 
While G20 countries have made remarkable progress in improving human 
health and increasing healthcare spending, more can be done to ensure 
access to affordable healthcare for all. By prioritising health equity and 
implementing innovative approaches to health finance, G20 countries can 
accelerate progress in transforming public health systems. It is hoped that 
some of the learnings shared in this chapter may inform and support 
continued commitment to addressing the complex and interconnected public 
health challenges faced by societies worldwide.
