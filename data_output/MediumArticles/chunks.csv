"Intro to Interoperability

Introduction"|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|bb894d4a987241c6b7827d4acabac6dc
A long time ago, every mobile phone used its own unique charging port design. Even two different Nokia models (yes.. that old) would refuse to breathe electrons using the same charging pin. And now almost every phone—save Apple— uses USB C. While it does take the uniqueness of the character away from a mobile phone model, it indisputably provides a lot of convenience for us, the users. Our days of hunting for chargers urgently while our mobile phone takes its last breath of life, are over. Now any mobile phone can be plugged into any charger, any were. That sounds like an obvious idea in retrospect. Duh.. why were we doing all that charger-matching business for so long when the solution was so simple? For one, it was good business for the phone companies to keep selling chargers for their phone models by reinforcing the ‘one model on charger’ paradigm. But for another reason that I can vouch for having worked with electronic physical interfaces for a living, It is not easy to design a|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|ebcfb9727a42482d986fa2b0a64fa8ac
for a living, It is not easy to design a standard interface that can fit all. It is even harder to then convince all the parties (companies) to use this standard, even if technically it satisfies all the requirements. Long and hard it took, thousands of engineers toiled for years, thousands of leaders lobbied tirelessly, and we finally achieved mobile charging interoperability. Yay!|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|5799ce249cde44a28db1429ca4c2171f
Once we have achieved the charging interoperability bliss, it is so hard to imagine the match-making-charger-lugging-emergency-hunting hell we dealt with back then. Yups… Interoperability does that! Now that the benefits of Interoperability are firmly established (though I admit… with a vague example ), Let’s see if Data Interoperability in Health and Wellness (HnW) can be useful. Spoiler alert.. it is! Health Data Interoperability (HDI) can offer benefits that are much larger than Interoperability in mobile phone chargers. It is also much harder to achieve. After all, what is a challenge if easy?|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|7eb8854be27f45e195dea63b72e2a111
What is Health Data Interoperability? Health data interoperability means the ability of different health information technology systems to communicate and exchange data with each other seamlessly, securely, and efficiently with the Patient’s consent. Interoperability enables health data to be shared among healthcare providers, hospitals, and other healthcare organisations, regardless of the technology platform they are using. Simply speaking, that means you should not be needed to lug your entire medical history in hard copy to every doctor, every time you sneeze. We have all experienced going to a doctor carrying that big fat folder, filed with withering pages of our medical history. And when the doctor asks questions about the missing information, so hard we try to recollect the name of the drug prescribed by the last doctor, or our allergies (Thou shan’t forget those!). And still coming out of the cabin only to remember a crucial detail we forgot to mention… Dam! Well… that was an|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|73070e9dc04e4ac7922d1d0048b67ab7
we forgot to mention… Dam! Well… that was an oversimplified — and slightly exaggerated for dramatic effect — reconstruction of my medical experiences visiting a doctor. But it drives the point home. Remember the mobile charger hell… it is like that, only the stakes are higher. Every healthcare service provider these days uses a technology platform to manage its services. This includes a Hospital management system (HMS), Electronic Health Record (EHR), Patient Record (PHR) system etc.|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|cbe8dd638b924f8394985b67838e7023
In practical terms, health data interoperability means that healthcare information can be accessed by authorised providers across different systems, regardless of where the information was originally generated or stored. This includes data such as medical histories, lab results, imaging studies, Insurance coverage, and other clinical information. Apart from healthcare providers like a hospital or doctor’s clinics, The purview of Health Data Interoperability includes Diagnostic labs, Insurance providers, Pharmacies, Wellness Service providers (Gyms, Yoga centres), Mobile Health and Wellness (HnW) apps, Wearable devices (iPhone, Fitbit, Glucometer), Government Healthcare Schemes like CGHS etc, and even public health research. The lack of interoperability has been a major barrier to the adoption of health information technology and the sharing of patient data in the past. But before we dig deeper into that, we must Quench the Question that is Quintessential to the Quest for a change from|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|5b862aff6afd493b9766e242ae3ee0fb
is Quintessential to the Quest for a change from the Quiescence. (Wow.. what a Quip.. right?)|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|3e17c85278284d38a2df361c47779e3d
Why Interoperability? Unlike the charger example (which is slightly irrelevant by now), The benefits of health data interoperability stretch wider than just convenience. It spans Primary Care—which is generally the first level of care that patients receive when they have medical concerns or needs and takes a whole-of-society approach, Secondary care — provided by doctors and other health professionals, most often provided in hospitals, Tertiary, and quaternary care. Here are a few reasons why Interoperability is important: Improved patient care Patients can receive more coordinated and effective care when health data can be shared across different providers and organisations. Providers can access a patient's complete medical history, including information from previous providers and hospitals, which can help inform treatment decisions and avoid duplicative or unnecessary tests and procedures. Reduced healthcare costs Interoperability can help reduce healthcare costs by eliminating the|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|cea903ef8852462d825e97f8f7929111
help reduce healthcare costs by eliminating the need for redundant tests and procedures and improving care coordination, which can reduce the likelihood of medical errors and complications. Additionally, interoperability can help identify high-risk patients who may benefit from proactive interventions to prevent costly hospitalisations or other healthcare events.|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|78e6fecffe0f47b2a87181651b51c042
Easier insurance claim settlement Health data interoperability can help with insurance claims by streamlining the claims process, reducing errors, and improving the accuracy and completeness of the data submitted with claims. It can also help reduce administrative costs and speed up claims processing. It can Improve the patient experience by reducing the amount of paperwork required to file a claim. Not that I know anyone who doesn’t enjoy tons of papers work that are currently required to file a claim… just kidding! Predictive Healthcare It can enable the analysis of large datasets from different sources, such as electronic health records (EHRs), claims data, and public health databases. By integrating these datasets and applying advanced analytics, healthcare providers can identify patterns and insights that can help predict future health outcomes, identify patients at high risk of developing certain conditions, and provide targeted interventions to prevent disease progression.|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|ed57a1e8402d4528a2914f71760fba91
interventions to prevent disease progression. Improved public health Interoperability can help public health officials identify and respond to disease outbreaks more quickly and effectively. Remember COVID19! It can also facilitate research into the causes and treatments of diseases, which can lead to better health outcomes for patients.|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|c70a9f10efce49bd98ff27d64a35b5a0
Enhanced innovation Interoperability can accelerate the development of new healthcare technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning applications, that rely on the availability of accurate and comprehensive health data. In summary, Interoperability is essential for improving the quality of patient care and reducing healthcare costs by streamlining the sharing of data among healthcare providers. It can also facilitate the development of new healthcare technologies, such as wearable devices, remote monitoring systems, and artificial intelligence applications, that rely on the availability of accurate and comprehensive health data. Wow, So many benefits. Why then are we not doing it already? In short, it is a continuous quest for improvement in healthcare governance. It is technically very challenging. And the hardest of all, It is an exercise in persuasion at scale, involving numerous parties with diverse interests. But the wheels are rolling faster than ever. There|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|bb0225f858ca494ca8c4c8190349dbf7
the wheels are rolling faster than ever. There has been a growing effort in recent years to promote and facilitate interoperability, including the development of national and international standards for data exchange (more on that in a subsequent article) and the implementation of government regulations requiring healthcare organisations to share patient data (more on that too, later in a subsequent article).|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|fd2d01b4782d466db9c4b7273a896f62
There is a surge in offerings by the big cloud players (MAG), for healthcare IT components as a service (SaaS), consequently, There is also an increase in “Interoperability as a service” offerings. So, I guess Here it is High time we Heed the question we Have not discussed Hitherto… How!|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|0ff5cf6e60214b328520d10b6ed8eeec
How do we achieve Health Data Interoperability? Here is when the fun part starts for a techie like me. One of the reasons why Health data interoperability is so challenging is because of how sensitive the data is. Healthcare must be dealt with with the utmost sensitivity which parallels and probably supersedes that of the finance data. At best, healthcare data mismanagement can lead to a wrong diagnosis for a patient, at worst it can lead to a question of life, death and public health catastrophe. Special care must be taken when the data is in flight. Which is to say when the data is being exchanged from one system to another, or within a system. Broadly speaking, we must talk about the following issues when talking about Health Data Interoperability. •	Vocabulary (Tomey-Toh = Toma-toe, Potey-Toh = Potaa-toe) •	Standard for data exchange. Who started the FHIR (spelling mistake?) and why? •	User Consent. •	Data Security. I am afraid if I discuss each of these topics here in this|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|d9f17a05951440e5891234fbd510f819
if I discuss each of these topics here in this article, it might become a TL; DR. So I think it is best to break it down into a series of articles. In the next instalment, I will dig a little deeper into the above-mentioned aspects of HDI, and the challenges involved with them. We will come closer to answering the ‘How?’ Part of achieving data interoperability in Healthcare.|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|152cb8d26b6b485f9eeb988655619e37
"In subsequent articles, I plan to write about the following topics. •	Development of national and international standards for data exchange •	Health data interoperability for Public health, OPD, Value-based care, and Social Determinants of Health. •	What are the various initiatives the governments around the world are taking in the direction of HDI? •	What are the steps the Government of India is taking, to achieve HDI Bliss in our country?

I hope this article added a little bit to your repertoire of knowledge. Any suggestion will be highly appreciated with 🍺 Thanks for reading. --- About me I am a learner of architecture (not the buildings… the tech kind).

"Interoperability How?

introduction

Vocabulary Standards For HnW data to make sense, using a standard vocabulary is the first must."|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|5c3bbe4e43a943f2b2f6ca701194f742
Image Source: https://www.cartoonstock.com/cartoon?searchID=CS289733 Consider the case of the word Rubber. In India, the word means a rubber eraser that children use to erase the pencil. In the USA, Rubber is generally understood to mean Condoms. These two objects not only have different uses but also cater to a rather non-overlapping age group. One can imagine how many embarrassing, if funny, confusions this can lead to. We don’t want that kind of confusion between our doctor, pharmacy and path lab about our diagnosis or the name of our prescription medicine. Vocabulary standards ensure that the healthcare data is accurately and consistently represented and understood by different healthcare systems. Over the past, many vocabulary standards have evolved to provide a standard terminology for health concepts. Each of them is designed for a specific use case, for example, the classification of medicines, or to provide standard codes for medical procedures, etc. In the coming sections,|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|b6af8a61cfa54d30a9fb16aec67db57a
medical procedures, etc. In the coming sections, let’s discuss a few of the most widely used standards out of the lot. The aim of this discussion is not to gain mastery over the lore of health data vocabulary but Rather to develop an appreciation for the complex problem they are trying to solve and the beauty with which they are able to solve it. International Classification of Diseases (ICD) The ICD standard is used worldwide as the international standard for reporting and monitoring diseases and health conditions.|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|6154ed4901934d09a9acb8c670e841e0
"It is maintained by the World Health Organization (WHO) and is used by over 100 countries. ICD provides a system of diagnostic codes for classifying diseases, including a variety of signs, symptoms, abnormal findings, social circumstances, external causes, etc. The system is organised hierarchically, with the highest level being chapters, followed by sections, categories, and subcategories. Each level provides increasing detail about a particular condition. For example, here is how two kinds of headaches are classified under ICD version 11. Headache disorders  (8A80 to 8A8Z) — Migraine  (8A80) — Migraine with aura  (8A80.1) — Migraine with aura, unspecified  (8A80.1Z)

Headache disorders  (8A80 to 8A8Z) — Secondary Headache (8A84) — Has causing condition: 1B2Z Mycobacterial diseases, unspecified (cluster code:  8A84/1B2Z)"|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|b44d09e785ae4fc89b5bb70810e7bd99
ICD is used by a variety of stakeholders, including healthcare providers, researchers, and policymakers worldwide to collect, analyse, and share health data. It is also used for public health surveillance for disease outbreaks and the management of healthcare resources. The system is regularly updated by the WHO with new medical knowledge and changes in medical practices. The latest version of the ICD, ICD-11, was released in 2018.|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|4b2aff66872344cc96df73b00327a95e
"Systematised Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) SNOMED CT is a comprehensive clinical terminology system. It provides a standardised way of representing a hierarchy of clinical concepts and their relationships. For example, general concepts, such as ""disorders"", are subdivided into more specific concepts, such as ""cardiovascular disorders”. There are further subdivided into even more specific concepts, such as ""myocardial infarction”. I don’t know what any of these disorders mean, but it illustrates the point. One of the defining features of SNOMED CT is its ability to represent complex relationships between clinical concepts, like so — Concept_1 – Relation_x – Concept_2. These relationships help us understand the concepts’ semantic meaning and their interrelatedness. For example, let’s take these concepts. Concept 1: Common cold (code: 82272006) Concept 2: Rhinovirus (code: 415810000) Concept 3: Viral infectious disease (code: 1400000) In SNOMED CT, there are"|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|4c90251fc22d41b787474c2a79876879
disease (code: 1400000) In SNOMED CT, there are relationships between these three concepts that describe the causative agent and pathological process of the common cold. Common cold (82272006) — Has causative agent (246075003) — Rhinovirus (415810000) Rhinovirus (415810000) — Is a (116680003) — Viral infectious disease (1400000) Common cold (82272006) — Has pathological process (405813007) — Viral infectious disease (1400000) So… Why did the SNOMED CT concept go see a therapist? Because it had too many relationships to deal with!|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|efb0449e9bde4d83b5b0ad037234e91e
Sorry for the poor joke. SNOMED CT is considered the world’s most comprehensive, multilingual clinical healthcare terminology. The standard is available in more than 30 languages and used in over 70 countries. However, It is available for a license fee, not free to use.|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|2bede5a3aaac4e13ab882e445262ba61
Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) LOINC is a database and universal standard for identifying medical laboratory observations. LOINC system has two parts. The Laboratory LOINC codes are used to identify laboratory tests and results, such as blood tests, urine tests, etc. The Clinical LOINC codes are used to identify clinical observations, measurements and their interpretations, such as vital signs, and physical measurements. A fully specified name in LOINC includes the following six attributes: 1. Component: The measured substance or property, such as glucose or haemoglobin. 2. Property: The aspect of the component being measured, such as the mass concentration. 3. Time: Time interval for which the observation was made, such as fasting or post-prandial. 4. System: The observed organ or system, such as respiratory or cardiovascular. 5. Scale: The method used for the measurement, such as nominal or ordinal. 6. Method: The procedure used for the observation, such as|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|ac59624643d0472caf45cec9280f346b
The procedure used for the observation, such as immunoassay or electrochemistry. A unique code (format: nnnnn-n) is assigned to each concept upon registration. For example, LOINC Code 8462-4 Represents the Component: Haemoglobin [Mass/volume] in Blood, Property: Mass/volume, Time: Pt, System: Bld, Scale: Qn, Method: Spectrophotometry LOINC has been adopted in over 180 countries and is available in multiple languages.|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|742fdd3127ef47b3ba2fc0184d773d8f
The LOINC International Advisory Committee (LIAC) works to ensure that LOINC is usable across different regions and health systems. LOINC Standard is available for free use.|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|c616062ba1c14cca9c3b48afd3957ea7
RxNorm RxNorm provides a normalised naming and coding system for medicines and their clinical components for managing clinical drug information in electronic health records. The structure of RxNorm includes three main components: •	Concept: A unique identifier (RxCUI) representing a unique clinical drug or ingredient that can be prescribed, dispensed, or administered. •	Term Type: The type of the term associated with a concept, for example, brand name, generic name, or ingredient. •	Relationship: A relationship between concepts within RxNorm, like ingredient, strength, dose form, etc. RxNorm concepts are connected by various relationships that indicate the associations between different medications. For example, a relationship can mean that a specific medicine contains a certain ingredient or that two medications have different strengths but are otherwise the same drug. Using these relationships, we can navigate the RxNorm graph from an ingredient to a fully-specified drug, and so|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|a58828060685479096e84a0aa26a1f82
an ingredient to a fully-specified drug, and so forth. RxNorm was developed in 2001 by the National Laboratory of Medicine USA in consultation with the FDA and the HL7 Vocabulary Technical Committee. Although primarily focused on medication-related information used in the United States, efforts have been made to expand its coverage to include other countries. NLM also offers a comprehensive set of APIs for easy integration with EHRs and other HnW systems. It is available for free use.|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|f4eb676c6fab4dbaa12962adc052b56a
Current Procedural Terminology CPT was created by the American Medical Association (AMA) in 1966. The original intended purpose of CPT was to code diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Later this was adopted by the US government for billing and reimbursements by healthcare payers, such as insurance companies and government programs like Medicare. The codes are used to report services and procedures performed by healthcare providers and to determine the appropriate payment amount for those services. CPT codes are now also used for data collection and analysis, research, and quality measurement purposes. CPT is limited in scope and depth, but it is the most widely used standard in the USA to report physician procedures and services for insurance reimbursement.|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|83fcbc70f24e44aa953d41e089b13aad
Canadian Classification of Health Interventions (CCI) The CCI standard was developed by the Canadian Institute for Health Information, to serve a similar role in Canada as the CPT standard in the USA. It is a comprehensive classification system for coding health interventions, procedures, and treatments for various healthcare settings. The CCI standard is organised as a hierarchy of Chapter > Section > Subsection > Intervention. The codes themselves are alphanumeric strings of the format C.XX.00.ZZ, where each of the four sections corresponds to the respective level in the hierarchy For example Code: 1.HD.40.EG01 represents: •	Section: 1 (Medical, Surgical, Diagnostic, and Therapeutic Procedures) •	Body system: HD (Hemic and Lymphatic Systems) •	Root operation: 40 (Transfusion) •	Qualifier: EG01 (Blood, Platelets, or Plasma for Transfusion) Unlike CPT, CCI Is available as open source. Hence it might be easier to extend to different geographical contexts.|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|3a791d2e6ad04b5c8541ca57cbce14dc
Phew… so many standards. But there are many more, spanning the length and breadth of the Health domains and Geographies. Here are a few more commonly used ones: •	International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) •	International Classification of Health Interventions (ICHI) •	Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) •	... And the list goes on. It would be an exercise in futility to list all of them here. But I think by now, we already have a good appreciation for some of the most common ones. We already know a few different ways to equate the Tomey-tohs and Potey-tohs to Toma-toe and Pota-toe of Health and Wellness.|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|b262a26a8f8b46eb99e1050113c1839c
Unifying the standards We now appreciate the complexity of the problem of standardising vocabulary in HnW. The more general the problem, the more complex it is. So, unifying these standards and building an all-encompassing one is probably still a long shot. However, it is not for the lack of trying. For example, there have been intense efforts for sharing the ontology between SNOMED CT and ICD to harmonise the two. ICD-11, which was released in 2019, includes SNOMED CT codes for several disease entities and other health conditions. This effort is expected to continue and expand. Many of these standards also provide code mappings to and from other standards for data portability. For example, RxNorm supports the mapping of other drug terminologies, such as NDC and SNOMED CT, to RxCUIs. This creates portability between different drug terminologies. New systems are emerging that complement one vocabulary with another — like SNOMED for clinical terms with RxNorm for medications —  to build|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|64fe16b3e45447409ca1bb45a7341a04
"terms with RxNorm for medications —  to build a more comprehensive system for the vocabulary. OMOP Common Data Model The Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI,  pronounced ""Odyssey"") is a collaborative effort to provide a common framework for the analysis of healthcare data. OHDSI develops the OMOP CDM, which stands for Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model."|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|a35cfc0b12cd4d74af798cf133dd51c4
The OMOP CDM includes a common set of tables and fields that capture various aspects of healthcare data, such as patient demographics, clinical encounters, diagnoses, procedures, medications, laboratory results, etc. The data model includes standardised codes for various concepts, such as diseases, procedures, and drugs, which enable standardised querying and analysis of the data. It also includes standardised terminologies, such as SNOMED CT, ICD, and RxNorm — Hey… we already know all about these fancy acronyms now! — to enable consistent data mapping and analysis across different sources. OHDSI has also developed a suite of open-source tools for working with observational data in the CDM format. These include software for data extraction, transformation, analysis and visualisation.|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|7ca4f64d2d694bf68cd8c047714c53c4
Common Terminology Services 2 CTS2 is an open standard developed by the Object Management Group (OMG!). It is intended to improve interoperability between standards, such as SNOMED CT, LOINC, and RxNorm, by providing a standard interface. It defines a set of common services for managing terminology content. These services include: •	Query Service: For search for and retrieval of terminology content. •	Mapping Service: For mapping concepts between different terminologies. •	Code System Maintenance Service: To add, modify, and delete codes. •	Value Set Definition Service: For defining and retrieving subsets of concepts from a terminology system. •	Terminology Change Management Service. CTS2 also defines a set of data models for code system, value set, and mapping, for representing terminology content. CTS2 is designed to be an extensible standard that can be used in a variety of healthcare domains. It is a relatively new standard — the first version was released around 2010 — still in|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|9c91c046bcd64e1ba58b1741c679dcd7
first version was released around 2010 — still in the process of gaining traction.|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|b1e4486c026945a6864a5b4cda534017
"National Health Stack In India, the National Health Stack (NHS) — the Indian government's flagship digital health initiative — Aims to provide a common technology framework for the integration of various health information systems in the country. The NHS is based on open standards and architecture to facilitate data exchange between various systems. This is an absolute must for such a complicated health ecosystem as India. The NHS draws from several established standards we previously discussed, like ICD, SNOMED CT,  LOINC, etc. I am hoping to write more about the NHS in a separate article in this series.

That was a long read. I admit, it turned out to be longer than I originally intended. But now that we know so much about these standards, are we poised to ask our doctor to write her observations in SNOME codes, and prescriptions in LOINC codes? That may be more legible than the English written in a doctor's handwriting."|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|3333449909284dab8a68a82fd4b5f064
Just a harmless joke. I have a lot of respect for doctors 🙌. I think they are the hardest-working professionals we have. Image Source: xkcd Well… While that may not happen any time soon, We can certainly expect the encrypted versions of our prescriptions and diagnoses  —  residing somewhere in the cloud in an Electronic Health Record system or a Hospital Management System or the National Health Stack — Are using these coding systems that we now know so much about. Isn’t that an empowering thought? Now that we have established the vocabulary, the next challenge is to understand the standards of data exchange.

Messaging standards Introduction In the first article in this series, we discussed the ‘What?’ and the ‘Why?’ Of Health Data Interoperability (HDI). In the previous article, we discussed the ‘How?’ part. We discussed various vocabulary standards like ICD, SNOMED-CT, LOINC, etc. So, now we know a variety of terminologies commonly used in Health Data. However, till now we only know the words and their spellings. For any reasonable information exchange, we must also learn the grammar (structure) of the data. Before you feel a strong urge to run away, please be assured we will not discuss any grammar here. This is just a loose analogy. Here is a more precise demonstration of what can go wrong in a lack of effective messaging standards.|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|ca50a54f820149718b7085196211f41b
"Health data interoperability is all about sharing health data between different systems and making sure they can understand each other. To do that, we need some standards for how the data should look when it is exchanged. These Messaging standards help healthcare systems and providers exchange information in a standardised and consistent way. They define how data is organised, what data elements are required, and how data is transmitted between systems.

History and Evolution"|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|0a62c5ef3edd4b0482eb892776e56f83
The concept of Messaging standards is not new to us techies. We already know messaging standards like JSON and XML that are widely used in web applications. Why then do we need separate messaging standards for health data interoperability? Half of the answer lies in the history of the HDI. While HTTP messaging standards evolved from HTML to XML to JSON, HDI standards also had an evolution of their own. Standards were crafted in the days before the Transmission Control Protocol — A layer below HTTP in the software hierarchy — commonly known as the TCP. Consequently, they look alien to modern human programmers. Given the complexity, HDI messaging standards were also slower to evolve than web messaging standards. So the most widely used HDI Standards still look similar to the old ones. In the early days of health data exchange, the domain was replete with many proprietary messaging formats, making it difficult to share information between different systems. In the 1980s, the American|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|48d65aee6c1740aaad58df228dbc052e
different systems. In the 1980s, the American Society for Testing and Materials developed the first healthcare messaging standard (ASTM E1238). However, ASTM E1238 was limited in scope and was not widely adopted. In the 1990s, a new messaging standard was developed by HL7 international organisation, called Health Level Seven (HL7) Version 2. It allowed for the exchange of clinical data, such as lab results, patient demographics, and medication orders.|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|27422346aee04f6493536ececd6d1b5b
In the early 2000s, a new messaging standard called HL7 Version 3 was introduced, which was designed to be more flexible than the V2. But it was not as widely adopted due to its complexity. The 30-year-old HL7V2 remains the most widely used standard to date. Another reason why HDI standards are hitherto different from web standards is the technical requirements. Health data requires a specific structure and context. It requires stricter regulatory requirements for privacy and security. Data governance — i.e. the ability to track the version history and the change history of the data —  is also an important requirement for health records. Any health data system must satisfy the strictest of the regulations, HIPAA compliance, to operate legally. We will talk more about that in a subsequent article. Historically, web messaging standards were not subjected to such regulatory concerns. But the good news is that the HDI and Web messaging standards are starting to converge. The newer ones|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|1edd887919344641bdc4748a66244baf
are starting to converge. The newer ones increasingly look alike. In recent years, there has been a push towards more modern messaging standards, such as Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). FHIR is a web-based messaging standard that is designed to be more flexible, user-friendly, and human-readable than HL7 V2 or V3. There is no dearth of literature on the internet about health data messaging standards. So, we may do well not going deep into each of them.|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|b99b61327bbe412b821190f424940a73
"However, It may be a worthy pursuit to look at some of the most commonly used ones with an intent to gaze at the landscape of the lore. HL7 V2 HL7 standards started in 1987 with V1 and evolved to now V4. But it was the V2 that stole all the thunder. It is a 30-year-old standard that has no resemblance to any modern data standards. And yet It remains the most widely used standard to date. This is what a message written in HL7V2 looks like.

The message is hierarchically organised into Segments > Fields > Components •	Segments are the basic building blocks of the HL7v2 messages. They start with a ‘type identifier’ like MSH (Header) and PID (Patient demographic information) •	Fields are the units of data within each segment. Fields in a segment are ordered. For example, in the PID segment, the first field is the patient identifier. •	Components are the sub-elements of each field, like first name, middle name, and last name, separated by a delimiter character such as a ^ or a |.

no points for guessing why. — I know… if computers had tongues, this would be quite a tongue twister, right? Despite being illegible to humans, the structure of HL7 V2 messages is similar to any hierarchical data format. Every message comes with a header (MSH) that contains information about the message type, the sender and receiver, and the message version. The above message, for example, is an ADT A01 message, which is emitted on a patient’s admission.|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|87ad86a32f8d4a8fa3c6250e3d807a6d
The message body contains the actual data of the message in the form of segments, fields, and components. HL7V2 was designed to work with MLLP — Minimal Lower Layer Protocol — A lightweight protocol that provides reliable and secured transmission of messages over the TCP. MLLP also includes error checking and retransmission capabilities to ensure fault tolerance in the presence of network errors. Most healthcare systems in the USA currently use the HL7V2.

FHIR Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource 15 years ago when I was an engineering student, sometimes all it took to hack a site and see other users’ data was to change the user IDs embedded in the URL of a page. Thankfully we have moved on from those simple days. Web standards these days are increasingly cautious about security, privacy and regulatory concerns. FHIR takes advantage of these developments and brings the format of health data exchange closer to the web standards. FHIR, pronounced as ‘fire’, is an HDI messaging standard that looks like the standard we techies love… JSON. It uses a resource-based approach to represent healthcare data. Each resource represents a discrete piece of data, such as a patient record, a medication order, or a laboratory test result. Resources are identified by a unique URL, and they can be accessed and manipulated using standard HTTP verbs such as GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE. I guess any full-stack developer will be complete at REST with that,|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|d62feff28420482a8f600e9489f69386
developer will be complete at REST with that, pun intended. When talking about RESTful APIs, one can never overstate the importance of data schema and validation. That remains true for FHIR as well. Let us take a small detour to understand what are schema and validations. Schema is like the blueprint of a piece of data, also called a resource, which tells the server the elements to expect in a resource. For example, a person’s data should definitely include a name field of the type string and an age field of the type number.|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|7f070abac16d4609ae91de8175f47f78
Optionally it may include an email, which must be of the type string and the format xxx@yyy.com. Validations, as it sounds, refer to the process of validating if a piece of data follows the given blueprint. The API designers design their data schema and share it with the data’s consumers and producers. The server validates the incoming messages and determines whether the resources included in it are in accordance with this schema before accepting the request. In the case of FHIR, the schema is called the profile, and It is a much more universal concept because the base profiles are defined by the HL7 organisation itself. The base profile of a patient resource, for example, mandates that it must include the patient’s name and date of birth, or the resource will be considered invalid. HL7 also enumerates the various resources predefined in the given version. The current version of the FHIR standard is called R4, likewise, the current base profile is called the R4 profile. The base|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|a6b6a4bb9d054701a790019960b99302
base profile is called the R4 profile. The base profiles are very general and designed to fit every possible use case. But they can be further restricted or extended based on an organisation’s business needs. For example, a Telehealth service provider may mandate that, apart from the base profile, the patient resource must have at least one phone number and at most one medical record number. Profiles are a part of the FHIR Implementation guides of an organisation.|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|2d3b7f719bf44320ae8973626ad5bb58
Implementation guides, provide detailed instructions on how to implement FHIR profiles and resources within a specific healthcare ecosystem. The concept of profiles and implementation guides is so important to the FHIR standard that an entire DSL (Domain specific language) is invented to simplify the process of creating and maintaining them. The DSL is called FSH — FHIR Short Hand — pronounced as Fish. It also has its own compiler which is called… surprise surprise… SUSHI. If nothing else, FHIR standards surely win the naming game. Using FSH and SUSHI, an organisation can create its own Implementation guides, profiles, and Structured definitions for their FHIR validations. SMART on FHIR Substitutable Medical Apps, Reusable Technologies With SMART, FHIR takes interoperability (and its collection of cool names) a few notches further.

with Electronic Health Record systems to access FHIR data.

DICOM Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine FHIR and HL7 are all right but what about medical images like X-rays, MRIs, Ultrasounds or CT Scans? Hence… DICOM. DICOM is widely used around the globe for the communication and exchange of medical images between healthcare providers, systems, software, and medical imaging devices. The DICOM standard is not one but rather a set of standards that include: •	Information Object Definition: IOD specifies how data elements should be organised and represented within a DICOM object. For example, a CT image IOD specifies what a CT Scan DICOM object should look like. •	Data Elements: DICOM uses a predefined set of data elements to represent information within a DICOM object. For example, patient information, imaging parameters, study details, image pixel data, and more. •	Network Communication Protocol specifies the use of the TCP/IP protocol suite for network communication between DICOM devices. It defines how DICOM messages are|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|50e91ace46ca49379dd3ab43054f9301
DICOM devices. It defines how DICOM messages are encapsulated within network packets and transmitted over the network. •	Media Storage defines the format and organisation of medical images and related information when stored. It specifies the file format, directory structure, and metadata requirements for media storage. Apart from this, DICOM defines interactions and operations, like acquisition, storage and printing, on objects with Service Class Specifications (SCS).|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|48f47b9eb2164ce6a0fb5ba41804767b
"It also defines Data Transfer Syntaxes to govern how the data is encoded and compressed for transmission. DICOM was first released in 1985. Since then, it has continuously evolved to accommodate the latest technology and industry needs. Recent versions of DICOM include DICOM Web, a set of RESTful web services that aim for easier integration of DICOM into web-based applications and workflows. DICOM has been updated to better accommodate AI algorithms and workflows in medical imaging. This includes defining new data elements and modules for AI-related metadata and annotations. It has also evolved to support emerging imaging technologies, such as 3D printing, molecular imaging, and advanced visualisation.

CDA

Clinical Document Architecture"|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|c77319de283b4f898a0b0b8d22420b01
CDA is a standard developed by HL7 to represent and exchange clinical documents. CDA is focused on the structure and format of these documents, providing a standardised way to capture and share clinical information in a human-readable format. CDA is typically used for document-centric information exchange, preserving the original narrative and layout of the clinical documents. CDA is based on XML and follows a familiar hierarchical structure that includes Header, Body and Sections. CDA also provides templates that specify which sections and data elements are required, optional, or repeatable in a document. In that sense, it looks very much like an HTML page. Some common types of CDA documents are Continuity of Care Documents (CCD), Discharge Summaries, Laboratory Reports, etc. While HL7 v2 and FHIR are more focused on real-time data exchange, CDA is designed for sharing clinical documents in a structured format. While HL7 v2 and FHIR are suitable for transactional data exchange and|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|e72824d09b01455db507f5916bc37ac7
are suitable for transactional data exchange and accessing discrete data elements, CDA is commonly used for longer, narrative-based documents that need to be preserved in their original form.|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|045fe3e5dfd7435089b71450147047ef
We discussed some common standards for data exchange in Health and Wellness. We are now empowered to understand the various data regulations and technology initiatives adopted by public health organisations across the globe. Governments worldwide are actively implementing regulations and technology for health data interoperability. For example, The USA emphasises using FHIR for data exchange and encourages data sharing among healthcare providers. The UK, Australia, Netherlands, Estonia, Singapore and almost every other country with a vision for public health is implementing similar regulations and technology to improve health data exchange and promote interoperability in their healthcare systems. India too has an ambitious plan for the National Health Stack that envisions a unified and interoperable framework that connects various stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem, including patients, healthcare providers, insurance companies, and government agencies. Learning various data|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|2ccc33d78d5648019b9070572c8ea5d0
and government agencies. Learning various data exchange formats also provides a leeway into the exciting field of these data architectures in Health and Wellness Information Technology. How should the data be stored in a Health Information System? How and when should it be transformed for Interoperability? Can the Interoperability standards also govern the data storage models? What are the security and compliances concerns with Health Data Storage and Exchange? So many exciting questions remain to be discussed.|data_input/MediumArticles/Health Data Interoperability.txt|4720605569b4471bb16afaf40f97963b
