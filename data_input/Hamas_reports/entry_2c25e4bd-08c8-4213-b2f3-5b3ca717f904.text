Background
Since December 2019, the Cybereason Nocturnus team has been investigating a campaign targeting Palestinian individuals and entities in the
Middle East, mostly within the Palestinian territories. This campaign uses social engineering and decoy documents related to geopolitical
affairs and relations between the Palestinian government, and references Egypt, Hezbollah, and Iran.
During the attacks, victims are infected with a previously undocumented backdoor, dubbed Pierogi by Cybereason. This backdoor allows
attackers to spy on targeted victims. Cybereason suspects that the backdoor may have been obtained in underground communities rather than
home-grown, as the evidence found in the code of the backdoor suggests it may have been developed by Ukranian-speaking hackers.
The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), content, and theme of the decoy documents, as well as the victimology observed in the
campaign, resemble previous attacks that have targeted Palestinians. In particular, these campaigns appear to be related to attacks carried out
by a group called MoleRATs (aka, Gaza Cyber Gang, Moonlight), an Arabic-speaking, politically motivated group that has been operating in the
Middle East since 2012.

Key Points
Cyber Espionage with a New Malware: The Cybereason Nocturnus team has discovered recent, targeted attacks in the Middle East to
deliver the Pierogi backdoor for politically-driven cyber espionage.
Targeting Palestinians: The campaigns seems to target Palestinian individuals and entities, likely related to the Palestinian government.
Using Geopolitically-charged Lure Content: The attackers use specially crafted lure content to trick their targets into opening
malicious files that infect the victim’s machine with the Pierogi backdoor. The decoy content of the malicious files revolves around various
political affairs in the Middle East, specifically targeting the tension between Hamas and other entities in the region.
Perpetrated by an Arabic-speaking APT, MoleRATs: The modus-operandi of the attackers as well as the social engineering decoy
content seem aligned with previous attacks carried out by an Arabic-speaking APT group called MoleRATs (aka Gaza Cybergang). This
group has been operating in the Middle East since 2012.

Infection Vector via Social Engineering
Similar to previous attacks, this campaign starts with social engineering. In one instance, it lures victims to open an email attachment. In
others, it persuades victims to download a report about a recent political affair pertaining to the Middle East and specifically to Palestinian
matters. In most cases, the downloaded file is either an executable that masquerades as a Microsoft Word document or a weaponized
Microsoft Word document.

Decoy Content
As soon as the victim double-clicks on the dropper, they are presented with the decoy document. The document lowers the victim’s suspicions
by distracting them with a real document while the dropper installs the backdoor. However, some of the documents also play an additional role
in the attack. While some are more neutral, quoting from newspapers and the media, others seem to report fake news to spread
misinformation that serves a political agenda. With regards to decoy content themes, this campaign resembles previous campaigns reported in
blogs by Vectra, Unit 42, and Talos. The contents of the decoy documents seems to include:
Potentially fake documents that appear to be issued by the Palestinian government.
Meetings minutes of different Palestinian organizations.
News about Hamas and the Palestinian National Authority.
Potentially fake, leaked Hamas documents.
Criticism of and embarrassing content about Hamas.

When the victims open the document, they are encouraged to click on Enable Content, which causes the embedded malicious macro code to
run.

Contents of the weaponized Microsoft Word document.
The macro code embedded in the document is rather simple and is not obfuscated. In fact, it is almost unusual in its unsophistication.
The macro code does the following:
1. Downloads a Base64 encoded payload from the following URL:
hxxp://linda-callaghan[.]icu/Minkowski/brown.
2. Writes the decoded payload to C:\ProgramData\IntegratedOffice.txt.
3. Decodes the Base64 payload and writes the file to C:\ProgramData\IntegratedOffice.exe.
4. Runs the executable file and deletes the .txt file.

Analysis of the Pierogi Backdoor
Pierogi, the backdoor in this attack, appears to be a new backdoor written in Delphi. It enables the attackers to spy on victims using rather
basic backdoor capabilities. While it is unknown at this point whether the backdoor was coded by the same members of the group behind the
attacks, there are indications that suggest that the malware was authored by Ukranian-speaking malware developers. The commands used to
communicate with the C2 servers and other strings in the binary are written in Ukrainian.
This is why we chose to name the malware Pierogi, after the popular East European dish.

Strings embedded in the backdoor binary that show Ukranian words.
The backdoor has the following capabilities:
Collects information about the infected machine.
Uploads files to the attackers’ server.
Downloads additional payloads.
Takes screenshots from the infected machine.
Executes arbitrary commands via the CMD shell.
In addition to spy features, the backdoor also implements a few checks to ensure it is running in a safe environment. Specifically, it looks for
antivirus and other security products.
1. The backdoor queries Windows for installed antivirus software using WMI: SELECT * FROM AntiVirusProduct

6/11

2. It looks for specific antivirus and security products installed on the infected machine, such as Kaspersky, eScan, F-secure and
Bitdefender.

Strings of security products found in the backdoor code.

Persistence Mechanism
The backdoor achieves persistence using a classic startup item autorun technique:
1. A shortcut is added to the the startup folder: C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup.
2. Once the user logs on to the infected machine, the shortcut points to the file binary location in the C:\ProgramData\ folder.

The backdoor persistence shown via Sysinternals Autoruns tool.

The GUID generated by the malware is saved in a file called GUID.bin. This file is created in the same folder as the binary of the backdoor
(C:\ProgramData\GUID.bin).

Contents of the GUID.bin file generated by the backdoor.

C2 Communication by the Pierogi Backdoor

7/11

The backdoor has rather basic C2 functionality implemented through a predefined set of URLs:
1. Sending machine information and a heartbeat to the C2:
URL: hxxp://nicoledotson[.]icu/debby/weatherford/Yortysnr
The information sent to the C2 includes:
cname: computer name, username, and GUID
av: Name of detected antivirus
osversion: version of the operating system
aname: the location of the malware on the infected machine

Sending basic information about the infected machine

2. Requesting commands from the C2 server:
URL: hxxp://nicoledotson[.]icu/debby/weatherford/Ekspertyza
Ekspertyza means expertise or examination in Ukranian. There are 3 basic commands coming from the server in the form of md5 hashes:

3. Uploading data (mainly screenshots) to the C2:
URL: hxxp://nicoledotson[.]icu/debby/weatherford/Zavantazhyty
Zavantazhyty means to load or download in Ukranian. This command is used to upload collected data to the C2 server. For example, in some
instances the backdoor uploads screenshots taken from an infected machine, as can be seen in the example below.

8/11

The backdoor uploads a screenshot of the infected machine to the C2 server.
4. Removing information:
URL: hxxp://nicoledotso[.]icu/debby/weatherford/Vydalyty
Vydalyty means to remove or delete in Ukrainian. The malware can delete various requests based on the command below.

Excerpt from the code that handles deletion requests from the C2 server.

Recent Infrastructure
The records of the domains and IPs involved in this campaign seem to show that the attackers created a new infrastructure specifically for this
campaign. The domains were registered in November 2019 and operationalized shortly after, as shown below.

Conclusion
In part two of this research, we examined the Pierogi campaign. Cybereason suspects this campaign targets Palestinian individuals and
entities in the Middle East, specifically directed at those in the Palestinian government. The threat actors behind the campaign use social
engineering to infect their victims with the Pierogi backdoor for cyber espionage purposes.
The threat actor behind the attack invested considerable time and effort to lure their victims with specially-crafted documents that target
Palestinian individuals and entities in the Middle East. In our analysis, we reviewed the TTPs and the decoy content, and pointed out the
similarities between previous attacks that have been attributed to MoleRATs, an Arabic-speaking, politically motivated group that has operated
in the Middle East since 2012.

9/11

The Pierogi backdoor discovered by Cybereason during this investigation seems to be undocumented and gives the threat actors espionage
capabilities over their victims. Based on the Ukranian language embedded in the backdoor, Cybereason raises the possibility that the backdoor
was obtained in underground communities by the threat actors, rather than developed in-house by the group.
