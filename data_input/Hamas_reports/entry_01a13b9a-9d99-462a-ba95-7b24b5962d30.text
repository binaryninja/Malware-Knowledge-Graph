The Cybereason Nocturnus Team has identified an active espionage campaign employing
three previously unidentified malware variants that use Facebook, Dropbox, Google Docs
and Simplenote for command & control and the exfiltration of data from targets across the
Middle East. The full report can be downloaded here (ungated) and the Indicators of
Compromise can be downloaded using the link in the header at the top of this blog.
In February 2020, Cybereason researchers reported the discovery of the Spark and Pierogi
backdoors that were assessed to be part of targeted attacks against Palestinian officials. The
attacks were attributed to Molerats (aka The Gaza Cybergang), an Arabic-speaking,
politically-motivated APT group that has operated in the Middle East since 2012.
The Cybereason Nocturnus Team has continued tracking the group, and in recent months
detected a new campaign leveraging two previously unidentified backdoors dubbed
SharpStage, DropBook, as well as a downloader dubbed MoleNet.
This latest campaign leverages phishing documents that include various themes related to
current Middle Eastern events, including a reportedly clandestine meeting between His Royal
Highness Mohammed bin Salman, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, the U.S. Secretary of State
Mike Pompeo and Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu.

2/5

New Espionage Tools Developed by Molerats: Cybereason identified two new backdoors
dubbed SharpStage and DropBook, as well as the MoleNet downloader, all of which can
allow the attackers the ability to execute arbitrary code and collect sensitive data for
exfiltration from infected computers.
The newly discovered DropBook backdoor used fake Facebook accounts or Simplenote for
command and control (C2), and both SharpStage and DropBook abuse a Dropbox client in
order to exfiltrate stolen data as well as for storing their espionage tools.
Political Phishing Themes: Themes used to lure the victims included the Israeli-Saudi
relations, Hamas elections, Palestinian politicians as well as other regional events including
a secretive meeting between His Royal Highness Mohammed bin Salman, Crown Prince of
Saudi Arabia, the U.S. Secretary of State and the Israeli Prime Minister
Connections to Previous Middle Eastern Campaigns: The newly discovered backdoors
have been observed being used in conjunction with the Spark backdoor previously attributed
to Molerats. The attackers also used the new espionage tools to download additional
payloads including the infamous open-source Quasar RAT that was used previously by
Molerats.
Targeting Across the Middle East: The operation was primarily observed targeting the
Palestinian Territories, UAE, Egypt as well as Turkey. Given the nature of the phishing
content, Cybereason assesses that the campaign operators seek to target high ranking
political figures and government officials in the Middle East.
