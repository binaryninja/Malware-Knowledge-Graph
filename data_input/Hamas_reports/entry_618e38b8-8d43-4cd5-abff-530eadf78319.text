New targets, use of MS Access Macros and CVE 2017-0199, and possible mobile espionage
1. Summary information
The Gaza cybergang is an Arabic-language, politically-motivated cybercriminal group, operating since 2012 and actively targeting the MENA
(Middle East North Africa) region. The Gaza cybergang’s attacks have never slowed down and its typical targets include government
entities/embassies, oil and gas, media/press, activists, politicians, and diplomats.
One of the interesting new facts, uncovered in mid-2017, is its discovery inside an oil and gas organization in the MENA region, infiltrating
systems and pilfering data, apparently for more than a year.
Another interesting finding is the use of the recently discovered CVE 2017-0199 vulnerability, and Microsoft Access files into which the
download scripts were embedded to reduce the likelihood of their detection. Traces of mobile malware that started to appear from late April
2017, are also being investigated.
Recent targets for the group seem to be varied in nature; the attackers do not appear to be choosing targets selectively, but rather seeking
different kinds of MENA intelligence.
Some of the interesting new updates about the Gaza cybergang:
Gaza cybergang attackers have continued their interest in government entities in MENA
New targets identified include oil and gas in MENA
New tools and techniques include
Abuse of the CVE 2017-0199 vulnerability

2. Technical details
Previously, Gaza cybergang attacks were surprisingly successful in using simple and common tools to achieve their goals. They relied on a
variety of Remote Access Trojans (RATs) to perform their activities, including Downeks, Qasar, Cobaltstrike…
As recently as June 2017, however, the attackers started using the CVE 2017-0199 vulnerability which enables direct code execution from a
Microsoft office document on non-patched victim systems (Cobaltstrike payload in this case). Another finding is a possible Android Trojan that
the attackers positioned on one of their command servers in April 2017.
In most cases, malware is sent by email as a compressed attachment or download links. Starting from March 2017, we have observed
downloaders or Microsoft office documents with embedded macros being sent to victims. When opened, the downloader would contact a URL
or IP address to retrieve the actual payload. Once successfully executed, the malware grants full access to the attackers, providing them with
the ability to collect files, keystrokes and screenshots from victims’ devices. If the initial downloaded malware was detected by the victim, the
downloader would attempt to retrieve other malware files to the victim’s device, in the hope that one of those files would work.
The full list of indicators of compromise (IOCs) can be found in Appendix I. The list of the most interesting lure content, malware files and
related droppers, and command servers can be found in Appendix II.

4. New findings

3/18

Gaza Cybergang attackers have been continuously evolving their skills on different levels, using new methods and techniques to deliver
malware, in addition to adapting social engineering decoys to regional political and humanitarian incidents.
In mid-2017, the attackers were discovered inside an oil and gas organization in the MENA region, infiltrating systems and pilfering data,
apparently for more than a year. The malware files that were found had been reported previously: https://securelist.com/gaza-cybergangwheres-your-ir-team/72283/
While traces of Android mobile malware have been spotted, attackers have continuously used the Downeks downloader and the Quasar or
Cobaltstrike RATs to target Windows devices, enabling them to obtain remote access spying and data exfiltration abilities. This is now
achieved more efficiently using the CVE 2017-0199 vulnerability which enables direct code execution abilities from a Microsoft office document
on non-patched victim Windows systems. The use of Microsoft Access database files has also enabled the attackers to maintain low levels of
detection, as it’s not an uncommon method to deliver malware.
These developments have helped the attackers continue their operations, targeting a variety of victims and organizations, sometimes even
bypassing defences and persisting for prolonged periods.

4.1. The extended use of humanitarian and political causes in social engineering attacks
Attackers have continuously targeted victims and organizations in government entities/embassies, oil and gas, media/press, activists,
politicians, and diplomats.
The Gaza cybergang relies increasingly on advanced and up-to-date social engineering techniques with political and humanitarian aspects that
directly reflect regional incidents. Here is a short list of incidents that were each used multiple times:
Palestinian Government not paying salaries to Gaza employees
Palestinian prisoners’ hunger strike in Israeli jails
The political crisis in Qatar
Recent targets for the group seem to be varied in nature, the attackers do not appear to be choosing targets selectively, but rather seeking any
type of intelligence.

Microsoft Access files with macro is another new development by the attacker group. MS Access database-embedded macros are proving to
have very low detection rates.

The attacks are a typical exploitation of CVE-2017-0199, starting with an email that distributes a malicious RTF document. The vulnerability is
in the code that handles Ole2Link embedded objects, which allows Microsoft Office Word to run remote files, downloaded in this case from
138.68.242[.]68. The downloaded payload is Cobaltstrike, which then connects to lol.mynetav[.]org to receive commands from the attackers.
Additional details on the Gaza cybergang’s use of CVE 2017-0199 with Cobaltstrike, can be found here:

4.4. Possible Android mobile malware
Traces of APK files have been seen on one of the attackers’ command centers, starting from 23-04-2017.
URL: http://alasra-paper.duckdns[.]org/send/%D9%88%ket-Edition-1.04_ApkHouse[.]com/Dont-Starve-Pocket-Edition1.04_ApkHouse[.]com.apk

The file name (Dont-Starve-Pocket-Edition-1.04_ApkHouse[.]com.apk), is an Android application file hiding as a popular game. We believe the
android Trojan could be related to a previously investigated Android Trojan around the Gaza strip: https://securelist.com/breaking-the-weakestlink-of-the-strongest-chain/77562/

5. Conclusion
The Gaza Cybergang has demonstrated a large number of attacks and advanced social engineering, in addition to active development of
attacks, infrastructure and the utilization of new methods and techniques. Attackers are actively improving their toolkit in an effort to minimize
their exposure to security products and services. Kaspersky Lab expects these types of attacks to intensify in the near term, both in terms of
quality and quantity.
In order to protect your company from malware, Kaspersky Lab researchers recommend implementing the following measures:
Educate staff to be able to distinguish spear-phishing emails or a phishing link from legitimate emails and links
Use proven corporate grade security solution in combination with anti-targeted attacks solutions capable of catching attacks by analyzing
network anomalies
Provide security staff with access to the latest threat intelligence data, which will arm them with helpful tools for targeted attacks
prevention and discovery, such as indicators of compromise and YARA rules
Make sure enterprise grade patch management processes are well established and executed.
