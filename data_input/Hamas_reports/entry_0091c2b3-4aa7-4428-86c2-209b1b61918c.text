Hamas Application
Infrastructure Reveals Possible
Overlap with TAG-63 and
Iranian Threat Activity

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Executive Summary
Insikt Group identified an application disseminated on a Telegram Channel used by members or
supporters of the Hamas terrorist organization. The application is configured to communicate with
Hamas’s Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades website — alqassam[.]ps. The website has worked
intermittently since the start of Hamas’s ground incursion into Israeli territory on October 7, 2023. From
October 11, 2023, onward, we observed the domain point to multiple different IP addresses, which is
likely related to attempts to evade website takedowns or, potentially, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
Infrastructure analysis associated with alqassam[.]ps led to the identification of a cluster of domains
that mimic the domain registration tradecraft of TAG-63 (AridViper, APT-C-23, Desert Falcon), a cyber
group that we believe operates at the behest of the Hamas terrorist organization. We also observed
that these domains were interconnected via a Google Analytics code. The domains were also
configured to redirect to alqassam[.]ps.
Last but not least, a domain associated with the cluster hosted a website that spoofs the World
Organization Against Torture (OMCT). Again, based on domain registration patterns, we observed a
likely Iran nexus tied to that domain.
Recorded Future Network Intelligence revealed a significant uptick in network traffic to the IP addresses
hosting alqassam[.]ps, which overlapped with the start of Hamas's attack on October 7, 2023, as well
as a significant reduction in traffic by late on October 10 (all times in this report are in UTC). This is
potentially due to website outages or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks directed at the website by third
parties.

Key Findings

●

The application dropped in a Telegram Channel claiming affiliation to Hamas’s Izz ad-Din
al-Qassam Brigades was designed to enhance the dissemination of the organization's message
via that application.
Multiple domains identified through Insikt Group infrastructure research revealed that they
shared a specific Google Analytics code; various domains were also identified redirecting to the
Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades website.
We observed domain registration tradecraft commonly associated with TAG-63, which shared
the website redirect to the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades website.
Our analysis suggests that infrastructure likely operated by the same threat actors revealed an
Iran nexus based on subdomain naming registration conventions. One of the subdomains
associated with this cluster hosted a spoofed page associated with the World Organization
Against Torture.
Recorded Future Network Intelligence observed an influx of network traffic to IP addresses
hosting the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades website at the start of Hamas’s incursion into Israeli
territory on October 7, 2023.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Analysis
The Al Qassam Application
The Al Qassam application was posted on October 10, 2023, via a Telegram Channel1 called
"‫( "كتائب الشهيد عز الدين القسام‬Martyr Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades) (Figure 1), where it was disseminated
to be shared with the group's membership base.

Figure 1: The application was advertised on the Telegram Channel of the Qassam Brigade on October 10, 2023. The statement
reads: "Download now the trial version of the ‘Al-Qassam Media’ application for ‘Android’ devices, so you can follow the news of
the Martyr Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades". (Source: Telegram)

The application is configured to communicate with the domain that acts as an outlet for the Qassam
Brigade — alqassam[.]ps — which, at the time of this analysis, resolved to the IP address 5.45.81[.]22
and is owned by a Panamanian entity called "IROKO Networks Corporation" (AS12722). We observed
the domain point to multiple different IP addresses from October 11, 2023, onward (Table 1).

The domain — alqassam[.]ps — resolved to 176.114.6[.]214 from May 2021 until October 11, 2023. On
October 11, the domain changed its resolution to 185.209.31[.]193, an IP address owned by a Russian
entity, "VDSINA VDS Hosting" (AS48282). According to public reports, this ASN is associated with
"Hosting Technology LTD'', an entity located in Moscow, Russia.

Sandbox Analysis
When analyzed in Recorded Future's sandbox (Android emulator), the application installed and
successfully launched but failed to load content, claiming a "connection failure" as noted in Figure 3.
The 2 options below the "connection failure" notification enable the user to attempt to connect again
via the "Try Again" (‫ )اعادة المحاولة‬option; we tried via various instances of the application loaded on
different virtual machines, but it failed to load content. The other option, "Close" (‫)اغالق‬, allows a user to
cancel, at which point the application terminates. As of this writing, it is almost certain the application
was not able to communicate successfully with the host website as it was knocked offline, potentially
due to hacktivist operations or a hosting provider takedown.

The application has been identified via different name variants (Table 2), but as of this writing all known
files are configured to communicate with alqassam[.]ps. Both the Recorded Future sandbox and
third-party sandboxes have determined the Android version of the application to be suspicious. That
said, the application does not request access to sensitive information from the device (such as images,
access to microphones and cameras, SMS, or geolocation data).

Identification of Domains and Suspected Link to TAG-63
We identified a cluster of domains that share the Google Analytics code UA-53251638, which is
associated with domains linked to Hamas threat actors, including the Al Qassam website (Tables 3 and
4). 4 of the 5 domains match the domain registration convention of TAG-63 domains we have identified
as part of our threat tracking. The domains listed in Tables 3 and 4 all shared the same redirect to
alqassam[.]ps.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Figure 4: Website redirect for the domains identified in Table 2 to the Qassam Brigades outlet (Source: DomainTools)

TAG-63 domains typically use English-language names — such as beatricewarner[.]com or
criston-cole[.]com — and are linked to attack activity through the dissemination of Micropsia malware.
In this case, the domains were all registered using the .icu top-level domain (TLD) and, unlike the
Hamas website, used privacy protections to mask the registrant name and other WHOIS data. The
threat actors also employed CloudFlare content distribution network (CDN) services for all domains
after they were registered using the NameCheap domain registration and hosting provider. Based on
the overlapping indicators, including the time of registration, we assess the domains are almost
certainly managed by Hamas operators.

This IP address is hosting legitimate domains and should not be assessed as attacker-controlled infrastructure.
This IP address is linked to the TAG-63 domains, however, via “First Seen” domain registration data.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

The domains listed in Table 3 are listed as malicious (1, 2, 3, 4) by a small number of antivirus engines;
Insikt Group has not identified any samples pointing to a specific malware family, like Micropsia.

Infrastructure Link to Iran
We observed a final domain — nikanps[.]top — sharing the above-noted redirect to the Al Qassam
Brigades website on May 25, 2023. This domain's registration history and details were also different
from the domains listed in Table 3. The domain nikanps[.]top was first registered on May 9, 2023, and
resolved to the Hetzner Online GmbH IP address as depicted in Table 4. The registrant also used
privacy protections to mask all pertinent WHOIS data. At the time of writing, the domain is not listed as
malicious by antivirus engines.

and DomainTools)

Recorded Future pDNS data indicates that the domain owner is highly likely also responsible for
registering the Dynamic DNS (DDNS) domain nikanpsx.hopto[.]org , which resolved to the same IP
address (91.107.188[.]236) in May 2023. As of this writing, the DDNS domain has not been listed as
malicious by antivirus engines.
Various subdomains of nikanps[.]top shared naming links to Iran, such as iran.nikanps[.]top ,
hamrah.nikanps[.]top , and modir.nikanps.top , for example. In Farsi, the terms "hamrah" and "modir"
mean "attendant" (or "along" or "comrade"), and "director" (or "manager"), respectively. As of this
writing, we have not been able to determine how they have been used by the owners of the domains.

The OMCT Page
The nikanps[.]top domain was, however, used to spoof a landing page associated with the World
Organization Against Torture (OMCT) (Figure 5). A subdomain — user.nikanps[.]top — that pointed to 2
IP addresses from May 9 to May 11, 2023, was detected via a urlscan submission on May 9.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Figure 5: Subdomain user.nikanps[.]top hosted a page spoofing the World Organization Against Torture (Source: urlscan)

At the time of submission, the subdomain resolved to 91.107.129[.]43. The second IP address that
hosted user.nikanps[.]top was 91.107.188[.]236, and while multiple other domains were hosted on the
latter IP address, only 2 others pointed to the former: admin.nikanps[.]top and hz.nikanpsx[.]top. The
earliest known "A" record of hz.nikanpsx[.]top dates to early January 2023. As of this writing, we have
not identified any malicious activity associated with the domain or infrastructure.
It is highly likely that the nikanpsx[.]top domain is owned by the same threat actors responsible for the
DDNS domain — nikanpsx.hopto[.]org — as well as nikanps[.]top. We have observed notable hosting
overlaps between subdomains associated with both apex domains — nikanpsx[.]top and nikanps[.]top
— since January 2023.

Google Code and Links to Palestinian Hacktivist Operations
We observed that many of the domains that share the same Google Analytics code (UA-53251638)
were also compromised and defaced (these are historical records) by threat actors that support the
Gaza-based organization behind the domain. In one of the defacements depicted in Figure 6, a
compromised Israeli website is defaced by an entity claiming to be Giant's-PS, a known hacktivist group
affiliated with the Palestinian Territories. One of the defacements revealed an uploaded video of an
operative dressed in military fatigues, with the Al Qassam Brigades flag in the background. We note,
however, that not all websites observed to have been defaced shared the same messaging and
presumed allegiance to the Qassam Brigades, as some depicted general support for Palestinian
statehood.

Network Intelligence
Recorded Future Network Intelligence revealed an increased level of traffic to alqassam[.]ps and
associated IP addresses that we investigated, which overlapped with the start of the ground attack into
Israeli territory on October 7, 2023. The sustained traffic peaked and started to decline by October 10.
We observed expected network traffic to a website that included connections to ports 80 and 443 from
globally dispersed IP addresses.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

The observation could be explained as internet user navigation to the organization's website, likely by
supporters or parties seeking to acquire information about the group's activities, as information was
shared by the group. Another explanation could be that the increased traffic may have been caused by
third parties seeking to attack the website using DoS techniques.

Outlook
The infrastructure overlaps that were identified between the Hamas application and the cluster of
domains we suspect are linked to TAG-63 tradecraft are notable — they depict not only a possible slip
in operational security but also ownership of the infrastructure shared between groups. One possible
hypothesis to explain this observation is that TAG-63 shares infrastructure resources with the rest of
the Hamas organization.
In relation to the Iran-nexus infrastructure link, we assess it is likely that the newly identified domains
(nikanps[.]top and nikanpsx[.]top) were operated by threat actors that share an organizational or
ideological affiliation with the Qassam Brigades. At the time of writing, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps (IRGC), and specifically the Quds Force, is the only known entity from Iran that provides
cyber technical assistance to Hamas and other Palestinian threat groups.
