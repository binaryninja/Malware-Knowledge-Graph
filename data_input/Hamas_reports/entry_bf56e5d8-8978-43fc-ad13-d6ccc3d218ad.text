Operation Desert Eagle
July 06, 2017

Operation Desert Eagle takes a look into the recent activity of the Molerats (Gaza cybergang) group.
These actors are believed to be politically motivated. For more on their earlier activity, see
(http://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Operation%20DustySky_TLP_WHITE.pdf).

Malware (NeD Worm?)
The quarrel between Trump and Abbas (a856f56fec6abdc3a93c3715be1567e5)

Network Activity:
DNS request

Server Response

Beacon
Connection check + Host identifier and campaign

Additional Beacon

2nd part of the beacon

POST /CheckVersion.php HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
User-Agent: 32170141182235342154130912011691581873993Send-N
Host: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
Content-Length: 447

9568=[host identifier]Random,&1077569=[Base64 Data]
User agent has campaign ID (Send-N, JOND, Random, or FUD) appended to the end of the victim’s
unique identifier string.
Another interesting thing to note is that the backdoor does not make the GET requests to the domain
names above (wiknet[.]wikaba[.]com or wiknet[.]moo[.]com). Rather it uses the IP that the host name
points to (in this case, my fakenet dns ip).
Let’s take a look on how this network traffic compares to the older NeD Worm samples

Host Activity:
Dropped Files:
C:\Program Files (x86)\%AppDate%\29175\explorer.vbs
C:\Program Files (x86)\%AppDate%\29175\News.url
C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\StartMenu\Programs\Startup\explorer.lnk

C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\StartMenu\Programs\Startup\explorer.vbs
C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\StartMenu\Programs\Startup\powershell.lnk
C:\CheckVersion.php

After execution, a registry key (HKU\...\Software\Microsoft\KeyName:) is created which contains the
backdoor in base64.

A VBScript replaces the following characters (~&^^%) each with a “0”. After the characters are
replaced, the file is then base64 decoded and executed.

C:\CheckVersion.php – contains the POST data used in the 2 nd portion of the beacon

Additional Backdoor Obfuscation/Delivery:
Sample (4cbebeda71dceb9914a21d06e22223af)
Once executed the sample makes a request for:
hxxps://gist[.]githubusercontent[.]com/0lol0/e69206a709a80133aebf55153847a6b2/raw/906a89289a
30dbef36b157600fac11f0f04e4684/System.ps1

System.ps1

The actors use the same obfuscation technique as the previous sample, this time replacing the
following characters “$#~dqw645” with “0”.

When taking a look at the github account for user “0lol0” we can see that the actors have reused this
account for another sample with a slightly different script.

The file 1.ps1 (other file on “0lol0’s” account) is a downloader (most likely for the backdoor):
