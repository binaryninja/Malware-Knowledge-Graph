By GReAT

Gaza Cybergang(s) is a politically motivated Arabic-language cyberthreat actor, actively targeting the
MENA (Middle East North Africa) region, especially the Palestinian Territories.
The confusion surrounding Gaza Cybergang’s activities, separation of roles and campaigns has been
prevalent in the cyber community. For a while, the gang’s activities seemed scattered, involving different
tools and methods, and different malware and infection stages, although there was an alignment in its
goals…
During our 2018 monitoring of this group, we were able to identify different techniques utilized by very
similar attackers in the MENA region, sometimes on the same target. The ﬁndings led to us distinguishing
between three attack groups operating within Gaza Cybergang:
Gaza Cybergang Group1 (classical low-budget group), also known as MoleRATs;
Gaza Cybergang Group2 (medium-level sophistication) with links to previously known Desert
Falcons;
Gaza Cybergang Group3 (highest sophistication) whose activities previously went by the name
Operation Parliament.
The groups use different styles and, in some cases, techniques, but deploy common tools and commands
after initial infection. The three attack groups were identiﬁed sharing victims. For example, Group1 would
deploy a script to infect a speciﬁc victim with malware belonging to Group2, or similarly between Group2
and Group3.
More information on previous Desert Falcons (Group2) and Operation Parliament (Group3) activities can be
found below:
Group2: ‘The Desert Falcons targeted attacks‘
Group3: ‘Operation Parliament, who is doing what?‘
Additional ﬁndings on Gaza Cybergang Group2 and Group3 will be presented in future publications. For
more information, please contact: intelreports@kaspersky.com

Summary
Gaza Cybergang Group1, described in this post, is the least sophisticated of the three attack groups and
relies heavily on the use of paste sites (with the operation name SneakyPastes) in order to gradually sneak
a remote access Trojan (RAT) or multiple, onto victim systems. The group has been seen employing
phishing, with several chained stages to evade detection and extend command and control server lifetimes.
The most popular targets of SneakyPastes are embassies, government entities, education, media outlets,
journalists, activists, political parties or personnel, healthcare and banking.
In this post, we’ll take a closer look at Gaza Cybergang Group1, including:
1. Updated 2018/2019 tactics, techniques and procedures
2. Victimology of the group between Jan 2018 and Jan 2019

Technical analysis
Through our continuous monitoring of threats during 2018, we observed a new wave of attacks by Gaza
Cybergang Group1 targeting embassies and political personnel. Gaza Cybergang Group1 is an attack
group with limited infrastructure and an open-source type of toolset, which conducts widespread attacks,
but is nevertheless focused on Palestinian political problems. The attackers rely a lot on chained attack
stages to evade quick detection and hide the communication infrastructure.
After an analysis of the samples, and through collaboration efforts with law enforcement agencies, we were
able to uncover the full cycle of the intrusions that spread across the majority of the cyber kill chain,
including but not limited to the toolset used, TTPs, infrastructure, action on objectives and the victimology.
These efforts have led to the takedown of a large portion of the related infrastructure.
In this campaign, Gaza Cybergang used disposable emails and domains as the phishing platform to target
the victims. Then pastebin.com, github.com, mailimg.com, upload.cat, dev-point.com and pomf.cat were
used as channels for the different malware stages before achieving a full RAT implementation, which then
communicates with the corresponding C2 server.
We have identiﬁed several implants that leveraged PowerShell, VBS, JS, and dotnet for resilience and
persistence. The ﬁnal stage, however, is a dotnet application that takes several commands such as
directory listing, screenshot, compress, upload, etc. It then creates random long string folder names in temp
directories to host the collected ﬁles per category before compressing, encrypting and uploading to the C2
server.

Spreading
The threat actor seemed able to spread attacks widely, but only deployed additional tools and data
collection functions in speciﬁc cases, as though they had a target list or a ﬁlter for targeted victims. Phishing
emails with political themes were used in the majority of the observed attack emails. These were necessary
to lure the intended type of victims – people involved in politics.
In order to meet the phishing emails’ infrastructure requirements, disposable domains and emails were
used as the delivery medium. On occasions, the phishing emails contained links to external domains to
download the ﬁrst stage, and sometimes the ﬁrst stage was attached to the email itself.

If the user clicks on the link, he will be prompted to download a RAR ﬁle that contains the stage 1
malware/lure, which he will execute afterwards.

Intrusion life-cycle analysis
The diagram below displays at a high level the steps taken by typical Gaza Cybergang Group1 lure
samples. While different samples may use different methods to infect (i.e. invoke PowerShell, VBS, .NET
app downloader, etc.), they generally stick to the same scenario of a persistent RAT that steals data and
uploads it to the C2 server despite the different hard-coded domains.

After analyzing the ﬁles downloaded from the above ﬁrst stage malware, it was clear that the threat actor
wanted to achieve stable persistence on the victim machine, and also used more than one technique to
exﬁltrate data. The analyzed samples had a lot of similarities in terms of the code used and especially in
the persistence techniques.

All the stages’ executables are created as chains to avoid detection and protect the C2 server. They consist
mainly of persistence mechanisms and simple instructions despite their different forms (VBS scripts,
PowerShell scripts, known software with open source code that can be backdoored, and in-house built
dotnet apps). The RAT, however, had a multitude of functionalities (as listed in the table below) such as to
download and execute, compress, encrypt, upload, search directories, etc. The threat actor’s main
objective for using this RAT (known as Razy/NeD worm/Wonder Botnet) was obvious from the victim data
that was collected – it was to search for speciﬁc ﬁle extensions such as PDF, DOC, DOCX, XLS, and XLSX,
where they are compressed in RAR ﬁles per category, stored in temp directories within a folder named by
victim ID (bot ID – long MD5 string), encrypted and uploaded to the C2.
Command

Brief Description

KEYWORD

Downloads encrypted strings found on the /Feed server page that represents speciﬁc keywords of inter‐
est which, if found, then compresses/encrypts using Winrar appending “Keyword” in the ﬁle name and
uploading to the C2 using a POST command at the path “/FeedBack.php”. FeedBack.php validates the
sender by User-Agent, saves the data in the “RAR” server directory and stores the metadata in the
mssql database for later reference.

Infrastructure
In 2018, the threat actor mostly relied on a single C2 server (192.169.7.250) and rotated a multitude of
domain names over a period of time. However, the attacks different stages were hosted on a variety of free
sites such as Mailimg, Github, Pastebin, dev-point.co, a.pomf.cat, and upload.cat.
The phishing email infrastructure though relied on disposable email providers such as bit-degree.com,
mail4gmail.com, careless-whisper.com and others.

Victimology
Based on the analyzed metrics, the victims were spread across 39 countries and reached 240+ unique
victims. The Palestinian Territories host the majority of the victims, followed by Jordan, Israel, then
Lebanon, as noted in the below table.
The most targeted entities are embassies, government entities, education, media outlets, journalists,
activists, political parties or personnel, healthcare and banking.

Conclusions
While Gaza Cybergang Group1 described in this post looks like a low sophistication group, with limited
infrastructure and attack ﬁles that can be found in the wild, they are the most relentless in their attacks, with
continuous targeting and high malleability. This has allowed the group to achieve reasonable success
against a relatively wide array of victims.
Gaza Cybergang is evolving and adapting to the MENA region – a complex setting with complex
requirements. The attacks are now divided into three groups with different levels of sophistication and
different levels of targeting. We expect the damage caused by these groups to intensify and the attacks to
extend into other regions that are also linked to the complicated Palestinian situation. The attackers also
seem to be within reach of more advanced tools, techniques and procedures, and we expect them to rely
more on these in future attacks. More information on Desert Falcons (Group2) and Operation Parliament
(Group3) will be presented in future publications.
