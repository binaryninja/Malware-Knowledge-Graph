KASPERAGENT Malware Campaign
resurfaces in the run up to May
Palestinian Authority Elections
ThreatConnect has identi ed a KASPERAGENT malware campaign
leveraging decoy Palestinian Authority documents. The samples date
from April - May 2017, coinciding with the run up to the May 2017
Palestinian Authority elections. Although we do not know who is behind
the campaign, the decoy documents’ content focuses on timely political
issues in Gaza and the IP address hosting the campaign’s command and
control node hosts several other domains with Gaza registrants.
In this blog post we will detail our analysis of the malware and
associated indicators, look closely at the decoy les, and leverage
available information to make an educated guess on the possible
intended target. Associated indicators and screenshots of the decoy
documents are all available here

[https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/campaign/campaign.xhtml?
campaign=4219181] in the ThreatConnect platform.

Some of the indicators in the following post were published on
AlienVault OTX on 6/13.

Background on KASPERAGENT
KASPERAGENT is Microsoft Windows malware used in e orts targeting
users in the United States, Israel, Palestinian Territories, and Egypt since
July 2015. The malware was discovered by Palo Alto Networks Unit 42
and ClearSky Cyber Security, and publicized in April 2017 in the Targeted
Attacks in the Middle East Using KASPERAGENT and MICROPSIA
[https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/04/unit42-targetedattacks-middle-east-using-kasperagent-micropsia/] blog. It is called
KASPERAGENT based on PDB strings identi ed in the malware such as
“c:\Users\USA\Documents\Visual Studio 2008\Projects\New folder
(2)\kasper\Release\kasper.pdb.”
The threat actors used shortened URLs in spear phishing messages and
fake news websites to direct targets to download KASPERAGENT. Upon
execution, KASPERAGENT drops the payload and a decoy document that
displays Arabic names and ID numbers. The malware establishes
persistence and sends HTTP requests to the command and control
domain mailsinfo[.]net. Of note, the callbacks were to PHP scripts that
included /dad5/ in the URLs. Most samples of the malware reportedly
function as a basic reconnaissance tool and downloader. However,
some of the recently identi ed les display “extendedcapability” including the functionality to steal passwords, take
screenshots, log keystrokes, and steal les. These “extended-capability”
samples called out to an additional command and control domain,
stikerscloud[.]com. Additionally, early variants of KASPERAGENT used
“Chrome” as the user agent, while more recent samples use “OPAERA” a possible misspelling of the “Opera” - browser. The indicators

associated with the blog article are available in the ThreatConnect
Technical Blogs and Reports source here
[https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/incident/incident.xhtml?
incident=4003314] .
The samples we identi ed leverage the same user agent string “OPAERA
[https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/customIndicator.xhtml
id=29927402&owner=Common+Community] ”, included the kasper PDB
string reported by Unit 42, and used similar POST and GET requests. The
command and control domains were di erent, and these samples used
unique decoy documents to target their victims.

Identifying another KASPERAGENT
campaign
We didn’t start out looking for KASPERAGENT, but a le hit on one of our
YARA rules for an executable designed to display a fake XLS icon - one
way adversaries attempt to trick targets into thinking a malicious le is
innocuous. The rst malicious sample we identi ed
(6843AE9EAC03F69DF301D024BFDEFC88
[https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/ le.xhtml?
le=6843AE9EAC03F69DF301D024BFDEFC88] ) had the le name
“testproj.exe” and was identi ed within an archive le
(4FE7561F63A71CA73C26CB95B28EAEE8
[https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/ le.xhtml?
le=4FE7561F63A71CA73C26CB95B28EAEE8] ) with the name “‫ﺍﻟﺗﻔﺎﺻﻳﻝ‬
‫ﺍﻟﻛﺎﻣﻠﺔ ﻷﻏﺗﻳﺎﻝ ﻓﻘﻬﺎء‬.r24”. This translates to “The Complete Details of Fuqaha's
Assassination”, a reference to Hamas military leader Mazen Fuqaha who
was assassinated
[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/world/middleeast/mazenfuqaha-hamas-killing-israel.html] on March 24, 2017.
We detonated the le in VxStream’s automated malware analysis
capability [https://www.hybrid-

analysis.com/sample/16df435ea8214cb0a62ab40720d8d0f5b65ba9268c84fc9e
and found testproj.exe dropped a benign Microsoft Word document
that pulls a jpg le from treestower[.]com
[https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?
host=www.treestower.com&owner=Common+Community] . Malwr.com
observed this site in association with another sample that called out
to mailsinfo[.]net - a host identi ed in the Targeted Attacks in the Middle
East Using KASPERAGENT and MICROPSIA
[http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/04/unit42-targetedattacks-middle-east-using-kasperagent-micropsia/] blog. That was our
rst hint that we were looking at KASPERAGENT.
The jpg pulled from treestower[.]com displays a graphic picture of a
dead man, which also appeared on a Palestinian news website
discussing the death of Hamas military leader Mazen Fuqaha. A
separate malicious executable 2DE25306A58D8A5B6CBE8D5E2FC5F3C5 [https://www.hybridanalysis.com/sample/5d329690a606857871f007b990b78f876c57a571b38cafd5
environmentId=100] (vlc.exe) - runs when the photograph is displayed,
using the YouTube icon and calling out to several URLs on
windowsnewupdates[.]com
[https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/host.xhtml?
host=windowsnewupdates.com&owner=Common+Community] . This
host was registered in late March and appears to be unique to this
campaign.
With our interest piqued, we pivoted on the import hashes (also known
as an imphash), which captures the import table of a given le. Shared
import hashes across multiple les would likely identify les that are
part of the same malware family. We found nine additional samples
sharing the imphash values for the two executables,

[https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/browse/index.xhtml?

Analysis of those les uncovered two more imphashes,

[https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/browse/index.xhtml?
lters=typeName%20in%20(%22Address%22%2C%20%22EmailAddress%22%2
, for a total of 20 malicious les. These additional samples behaved
similarly to the initial les; testproj.exe dropped benign decoy les and
started malicious executables. The malicious executables all called out
to the same URLs on windowsnewupdates[.]com.
These malware samples leverage the user agent string “OPAERA,” the
same one identi ed in the Targeted Attacks in the Middle East Using
KASPERAGENT and MICROPSIA
[http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/04/unit42-targetedattacks-middle-east-using-kasperagent-micropsia/] blog. Although the
command and control domain was di erent from those in the report,
the POST and GET requests were similar and included /dad5/ in the URL
string. In addition, the malware samples included the kasper PDB string
reported by Unit 42, prompting us to conclude that we were likely
looking at new variants of KASPERAGENT.

The Decoy Files
Several of the decoy les appeared to be o cial documents associated
with the Palestinian Authority - the body that governs the Palestinian
Territories in the Middle East. We do not know whether the les are
legitimate Palestinian Authority documents, but they are designed to
look o cial. Additionally, most of the decoy les are publicly available
on news websites or social media.
The rst document - dated April 10, 2017 - is marked “Very Secret” and
addressed to Yahya Al-Sinwar, who Hamas elected as its leader in Gaza
in February 2017. Like the photo displayed in the rst decoy le we
found, this document references the death of Mazen Fuqaha. The
Arabic-language text and English translation of the document are
available in ThreatConnect here

[https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/document/document.xhtml?
document=4219292] . A screenshot of the le is depicted below.

The second legible le, dated April 23, has the same letterhead and also
is addressed to Yahya al-Sinwar. This le discusses the supposed
announcement banning the rival Fatah
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah] political party, which controls the
West Bank, from Gaza. It mentions closing the Fatah headquarters and
houses that were identi ed as meeting places as well as the arrest of
some members of the party.

Looking at the Infrastructure
We don’t know for sure who is responsible for this campaign, but
digging into the passive DNS results led us to some breadcrumbs.
Starting with 195.154.110[.]237
[https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/address.xhtml?
address=195.154.110.237&owner=Common+Community] , the IP
address which is hosting the command and control domain

windowsnewupdates[.]com, we found that the host is on a dedicated
server.

ThreatConnect DomainTools Integration Results
Using our Farsight DNSDB integration, we identi ed other domains
currently and previously hosted on the same IP.

Reverse DNS and Passive DNS results for 195.154.110[.]237

Two of the four domains that have been hosted at this IP since 2016 -up le2box[.]com and 7aga[.]net -- were registered by a freelance web
developer in Gaza, Palestine. This IP has been used to host a small
number of domains, some of which were registered by the same actor,
suggesting the IP is dedicated for a single individual or group’s use.
While not conclusive, it is intriguing that the same IP was observed
hosting a domain ostensibly registered in Gaza AND the command and
control domain associated with a series of targeted attacks leveraging
Palestinian Authority-themed decoy documents referencing Gaza.

Targeting Focus?
Just like we can’t make a de nitive determination as to who conducted
this campaign, we do not know for sure who it was intended to target.
What we do know is that several of the malicious les were submitted to
a public malware analysis site from the Palestinian Territories. This tells
us that it is possible either the threat actors or at least one of the targets
is located in that area. Additionally, as previously mentioned, the decoy
document subject matter would likely be of interest to a few di erent
potential targets in the Palestinian Territories. Potential targets such as
Hamas who controls the Gaza strip and counts Mazen Fuqaha and
Yahya al-Sinwar as members, Israel which is accused of involvement in
the assassination of Mazen Fuqaha
[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/world/middleeast/mazenfuqaha-hamas-killing-israel.html] , and the Fatah party of which the
Prime Minister and President of the Palestinian Authority are members.
The campaign corresponds with a period of heightened tension in Gaza.
Hamas, who has historically maintained control over the strip, elected
Yahya al-Sinwar - a hardliner from its military wing - as its leader in
February. A Humanitarian Bulletin
[https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/AC8C02B3FA96AA208525811C0

published by the United Nations’ O ce for the Coordination of
Humanitarian A airs indicates in March 2017 (just before the rst
malware samples associated with this campaign were identi ed in early
April) Hamas created “a parallel institution to run local ministries in
Gaza,” further straining the relationship between Hamas and the
Palestinian Authority who governs the West Bank. After this
announcement, the Palestinian Authority cut salaries for its employees
in Gaza by 30 percent and informed Israel that it would no longer pay
for electricity provided to Gaza
[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/world/middleeast/palestinianauthority-hamas-gaza-electricity.html] causing blackouts throughout the
area and escalating tensions between the rival groups. Then, in early
May (two days after the last malware sample was submitted) the
Palestinian Authority held local elections
[http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/palestinian-west-banklocal-elections-test-fatah-party-47389952] in the West Bank which were
reportedly seen as a test for the Fatah party. Elections were not held in
Gaza.
All of that is to say, the decoy documents leveraged in this campaign
would likely be relevant and of interest to a variety of targets in Israel
and Palestine, consistent with previously identi ed KASPERAGENT
targeting patterns. Additionally, the use of what appear to be carefully
crafted documents at the very least designed to look like o cial
government correspondence suggests the malware may have been
intended for a government employee or contractor who would be
interested in the documents’ subject matter. More associated indicators,
screenshots of many of the decoy documents, and descriptions of the
activity are available via the March - May 2017 Kasperagent Malware
Leveraging WindowsNewUpdates[.]com Campaign
