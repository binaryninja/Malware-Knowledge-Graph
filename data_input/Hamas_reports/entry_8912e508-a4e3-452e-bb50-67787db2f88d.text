Current Landscape
International Relations
Iran’s foreign policy with its neighbours and globally
is entrenched in a number of issues. One that it is
dominated by the petrochemical industry, nuclear
enrichment, an ideological framework, regional turmoil
and relative isolation4. Since the fall of the Soviet
Union and the increased presence of US troops in the
region, it has had to handle perceived existential threat
from the US and its allies and a unique set of regional
influences5. Overall Iran experiences cordial relations
with South Caucasus and Central Asia, underpinned
by a pragmatic outlook that does not want to upset
Moscow or Beijing. It sees Armenia as its “gateway to
Europe” and Turkmenistan as its “gateway to Central
Asia”. Iran prioritises relations from the Persian Gulf
and Levant alongside Turkey. It sees Israel and Saudi
Arabia as threats to its existence and its future as the
dominant regional power. Iran’s nuclear ambitions have
been the cause for ongoing international sanctions
against its financial, petrochemical, transportation and
shipping sectors. Reports surrounding their enrichment
program suggest the country is a long way off equipping
missiles with nuclear warheads and that for the most

part they have an abundance of conventional missiles6.
However, the goal to become a nuclear power is in
alignment with its regional ambitions to have better US
deterrence and more regional political leverage. The
Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), set forth
requirements for Iran to halt its uranium enrichment,
and make efforts to alter regional activities, including
supporting proxy groups and terrorist organisations, for
some sanctions relief. The US Trump administration has
adopted an oppositional outlook towards Tehran once
again however, as evidenced by changing their position
on the JCPOA.

Internal security posture
Securing control of its internal political space is a top
priority for the Iranian regime. The ability to cause societal discontent through online communication channels,
and generate conflict was felt keenly by the Middle East
in the aftermath of the Arab Spring in 2011. Since then,
Iran has invested in internal internet governance and
pursued a hard-line stance against perceived dissident
or anti-revolutionary activity. The Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps (IRGC) website details some of the country’s

strategy in this area, and justifies its goals as helping to
define parameters for “acceptable culture”7. The pursuit of internal control has led to the implementation of
the National Information Network (NIN). This is based
on ideas to monitor internet usage, and block subversive content, not unlike SORM of Russia and the “Great
Chinese Firewall”. The data captured by this national
intranet can be accessed by the country’s intelligence
and law enforcement agencies8. Freedom of expression
is regularly reported as being restricted as well. Iranian
legislation makes many non-violent crimes punishable
by death. Many ordinary users of social media have been
brought to the IRGC or arrested for making comments
on controversial issues (such as fashion)9. In 2016 Iran
carried out the largest mass executions in years. Despite
being considered a moderate, President Rouhani has
been accused of not doing enough to counter the more
hard-line actions of the judiciary or the IRGC10.

Economy
Iran is the second largest economy (after Saudi Arabia)
in the Middle East and North African region (MENA),
and has the second largest population after Egypt11. The
country relies heavily on oil revenues. Rigorous implementation of sanctions over the last several years have
been hard hitting on the economy. Between 2011 and
2014 the currency took a nosedive as the Rial lost 80% of
its value against the dollar12. Iran has the second largest
proven natural gas deposits globally, and could counter
the impact of sanctions on oil, but it requires foreign
investment. Due to the sanctions, many countries and
companies have shied away from investing in Iran’s gas
deposits. Despite some gains under previous sanctions in the international community’s eyes, present US
leadership does not seem to articulate a very promising
outlook. However, Europe, Russia, China and India have

all voiced opposition to Trump’s unilateral stance. During
2016 the economy experienced a notable recovery.

National Cyber-Strategy
Iran’s attention was drawn to the development of its
own offensive and defensive cyber capability after being
attacked by the Stuxnet virus, followed by Duqu and
Flame. The government pledged $1 billion investment
in 201113, creating the Supreme Council of Cyberspace
(SCC), Cyber Headquarters (under the Armed Forces
General Staff), Cyber Command, the Basij cyberspace
council, Cyber Police FETA and began recruiting talent
into the industry. ICT ministries cooperated with the
AFGS Cyber Headquarters to monitor vulnerabilities
and threats to infrastructure. The SCC works with the
National Center of Cyberspace under the direction of
President Hassan Rouhani and Secretary Abolhassan
Firouzabadi, coordinating and implementing cyberspace
policy in Iran14. The MAHER/ Iran National CERT is
responsible for incident response15. Since Stuxnet, Iran
has matured into one of the more advanced actors
globally, not afraid of being offensively oriented.

Iranian Intelligence and Cyber
Services
The fast development of Iran’s cyber capability has meant
that a number of organisations have been either created
or have developed their own subdivisions to carry out
activity. The Supreme National Security Council under
the auspices of the Supreme Leader Khamenei, seems
to oversee all of the different intelligence services. The
most prominent intelligence service seems to be the
Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS), which works
in conduit with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp’s
(IRGC) Quds-Force and intelligence unit.

Activity Overview
The Islamic Republic’s revolutionary foundations have
helped to orient its offensive activities (both standard
and cyber) in an asymmetric fashion. This is because
of the unique regional influences it has to contend
with, including a number of global powers exercising
direct and indirect power over its affairs. Because of
the early trauma of the Stuxnet virus, Iran has been
able to experience first-hand the impact of such a
campaign. With investment, a sophisticated offensive
cyber capability could grant Iran the leverage it craves
as a US deterrent and regional power. Therefore, it is not
surprising that Iran capitalized on the attack and has
since aggressively pursued its own capability. They are
already more mature than most of the Gulf Cooperation
Council states (GCC).
One of the major worries from the international
community, voiced in the implementation of sanctions
over the years, has been Tehran’s support of proxygroups. Some of these groups, labelled as terrorist
organisations, operate in regional conflict hotspots such
as Palestine, Yemen and Syria. Iran provides training
and resources to groups such as Lebanese Hezbollah,
Badr Corps, Kata’ib Hezbollah and Asa’ib ahl al-Haq38. In
a similar fashion (and not unlike other global powers),
the Islamic Republic has been using hacktivist groups
to support its endeavours and further their own aims.
There has even been reports that Iran may has been
funding the Syrian Electronic Army (SEA)39 40. Its overt
support for Hezbollah, Houthis and Hamas are paralleled
in accusations that Iran is helping to form cyber units for
proxy groups as well.
Parallels can be drawn between those countries that
Iran perceives as a priority threat to the security of
the republic, and attributed cyber campaigns. This is
evidenced by US indictment of several Iranian individuals
believed to be associated with the IRGC. The indictment
is in response to denial of service attacks against US
financial entities between 2011 and 201341. In 2012,

the destructive Shamoon virus targeted Saudi Aramco
(Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil company). Saudi is a
competing regional power led by a Sunni government
that Iran is in direct confrontation with. This manifests
in the surrounding conflicts and in the energy industry.
They also share a long-term, overarching historic notion
of religious superiority that is in direct conflict (Sunni
vs Shia). This ideological conflict is entrenched and is
unlikely to be resolved.

Future Concerns
Saudi Arabia
The relationship between Riyadh and Tehran has been
tenuous and complex at best. The two regional powers
are usually discussed in context of their ideologically
opposed religious affiliation, Saudi Arabia has majority
Sunni population whilst Iran is Shia. The conflict between
the two countries was deepened more recently by a
harsh anti-Iranian resolution issued at the UN in 2016,
and the execution of a prominent Shia cleric Sheikh
Nimr al-Nimr42. When Iran was given the opportunity to
start participating in the international economic system
again, Saudi Arabia viewed this with alarm43. Given the
pragmatic approach Iran has displayed towards meeting
its requirements in the JCPOA, some would suggest that
Iran is not going to be provocative and offensive. Saudi is
better financed militarily and better equipped. However,
in the long-term, Iran sees itself as progressing and
only becoming more influential whilst Saudi Arabia
has to contend with maintaining an edge. Iran is likely
to continue to use indirect means to undermine Saudi
Arabia, using proxy-groups and disinformation.

The United States
The United States has already been the at the receiving
end of some of Iran’s offensive activity. The US is responsible for the implementation of harsh international
sanctions that have demonstrably impacted the Iranian
economy. The JCPOA, agreed upon by moderate President Hassan Rouhani with the P5+1, provided some

sanctions relief and this contributed to economic growth in
2016. However, the real threat of fresh and revived sanctions from the Trump administration is likely to hurt Iran’s
renewed optimism and hostility can already be observed.
Confounded by a mixture of Anti-American sentiment based
on historic regional US interference, Iran is unlikely to stop
perceiving the US as an adversary in the near future. Consequently, the US is a worthy adversary to conduct asymmetric activity against. This may manifest in both direct
and indirect campaigns. It is probably not a coincidence
that a country under harsh sanctions against its financial
sector has historically targeted the financial sector of the
said persecutor (US). This might be repeated, if so then the
mirror target for the IRGC would be US Cyber Command or
another government/military adversary. he ability for Iran
to think strategically has been observed too though. It may
opt for continuing its tradition of using proxy-groups to
provoke and attack larger better equipped forces it doesn’t
really want a full-scale war with44.

Israel
Iran has pursued an aggressive stance towards Israel since
fall of the Soviet Union, after which it severed diplomatic
relations. This may have been due in part, for the need to
appeal to Arab and Muslim opinion whilst relations were
redefined in that era. The then President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad used very anti-Semitic language45. The creation
of the state of Israel, and expansion of settlements, is a
historic wound and reminder of Western interference in the
region. Israel is accused of being behind the Stuxnet virus
alongside the US. Iran is accused of funding and equipping
Palestinian paramilitary group Hamas with missiles. During
Operation Protective Edge in 2014, in which 2,100 Palestinians (mostly civilians)46 were killed by the Israel Defense
Force (IDF), Iran is attributed to a number of cyber-attacks
against Israeli entities47. This relationship is unlikely to
change in the near future as Israel is viewed as a justifiable
adversary to attack and undermine through any means.

Kazakhstan
The location of Kazakhstan combined with it being the top
producer of Uranium, makes this country a very important ally of Iran. Sanctions impacted economic exchanges
between the two states. Diplomatic relations between the
two countries have come under suspicion in the past as Iran

is accused of only being interested in knowledge transfer
from Kazakstan’s scientists and as a source of Uranium48.
International suspicion has led Kazakhstan to be demonstrably cautious in its dealings with Tehran. Iran’s interest
in Kazakhstan’s scientists could be an area of intellectual
theft and cyber espionage as part of achieving its nuclear
ambitions.

Syria/Iraq
Tehran supports President Bashar al-Assad along with
Russia in the Syrian civil war. Continued engagement in
this area is highly likely. Iran shares a border with Iraq, so
the outcome of the conflict and the need for a pro-Iranian government is important. Iran is likely to continue to
undermine any progress Western-backed, or Saudi-backed
forces make in the area through proxy-groups, cyber-attacks and conventional military support.

Latin America
Iran has reportedly operated an intelligence network in
Latin America for decades49. The network is believed to
be channeled through embassies, mosques and affiliation
through Hezbollah. Hezbollah’s presence in the region has
been linked to organized crime and as a means for revenue50. Iran is also not shy about conducting cyber-attacks
in Latin America. A recent report showed Iran, working
in conduit with Venezuela, planning an attack against US
systems made to look like it originated from Mexico51.
Venezuela and Iran are both coping with oil sanctions, and
are working with Syria to construct a new refinery. With
this in mind, it would not be unreasonable to assume Iran
will continue to penetrate Latin America for intelligence
purposes, to subvert some of the constraints placed by
international sanctions and as a means for proxy attacks.

South Caucasus and Central Asia
Despite cordial relations with the majority of states in this
region, Iran has to be very strategic in how it handles its
relationships and access to resources. This is because of
the competing influences of China and Russia. Azerbaijan
has also been very close to Israel, exchanging defence technology and increased trade. This has given Iran some cause
for concern. Any opportunity to understand the web of
interests in this area is likely to be taken advantage of. This
might indicate an area of interest for espionage campaigns.
