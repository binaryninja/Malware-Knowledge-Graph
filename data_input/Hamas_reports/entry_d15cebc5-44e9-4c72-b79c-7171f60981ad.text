World War C: Understanding Nation-State Motives Behind Today’s Advanced Cyber Attacks

Executive Summary
Cyberspace has become a full-blown war zone as governments across the globe clash for digital
supremacy in a new, mostly invisible theater of operations. Once limited to opportunistic criminals,
cyber attacks are becoming a key weapon for governments seeking to defend national sovereignty
and project national power.
From strategic cyber espionage campaigns, such as Moonlight Maze and Titan Rain, to the destructive,
such as military cyber strikes on Georgia and Iran, human and international conflicts are entering a new
phase in their long histories. In this shadowy battlefield, victories are fought with bits instead of bullets,
malware instead of militias, and botnets instead of bombs.
These covert assaults are largely unseen by the public. Unlike the wars of yesteryear, this cyber war
produces no dramatic images of exploding warheads, crumbled buildings, or fleeing civilians. But the
list of casualties—which already includes some of the biggest names in technology, financial services,
defense, and government —is growing larger by the day.
A cyber attack is best understood not as an end in itself, but as a potentially powerful means to a wide
variety of political, military, and economic goals.
“Serious cyber attacks are unlikely to be motiveless,” said Martin Libicki, Senior Scientist at RAND Corp.
“Countries carry them out to achieve certain ends, which tend to reflect their broader strategic goals.
The relationship between the means chosen and their goals will look rational and reasonable to them if
not necessarily to us.”
Just as each country has a unique political system, history, and culture, state-sponsored attacks also
have distinctive characteristics, which include everything from motivation to target to type of attack.
This report describes the unique characteristics of cyber attack campaigns waged by governments
worldwide. We hope that, armed with this knowledge, security professionals can better identify their
attackers and tailor their defenses accordingly.
Here is a quick overview:
• Asia-Pacific. Home to large, bureaucratic hacker groups such as the “Comment Crew” who pursue
many goals and targets in high-frequency, brute-force attacks.
• Russia/Eastern Europe. These cyber attacks are more technically advanced and highly effective
at evading detection.
• Middle East. These hackers are dynamic, often using creativity, deception, and social engineering
to trick users into compromising their own computers.
• United States. The most complex, targeted, and rigorously engineered cyber attack campaigns
to date.

Introduction
World War Z—a bestselling book and Hollywood movie—detailed a global pandemic in which politics
and culture deeply influenced how the public—and by extension, governments—reacted to a zombie
plague. In one passage, for example, an Arab boy refused to believe that the disease was real,
suspecting that Israel had fabricated the story. The nations described in World War Z—the United States,
China, Russia, South Korea, Israel, and many others—are involved in a very different type of conflict,
but one with real and growing national security impact: World War C, where “C” stands for “Cyber”.
However, the same rule applies: each country has a unique political system, history, language, culture,
and understanding of human and international conflict.
Cyber conflict often mirrors traditional conflict. For example, China uses high-volume cyber attacks
similar to how it used infantry during the Korean War. Many Chinese soldiers were sent into battle with
only a handful of bullets. Given their strength in numbers, they were still able to achieve battlefield
victories. On the other end of the spectrum lie Russia, the U.S., and Israel, whose cyber tactics are more
surgical, reliant on advanced technologies and the cutting-edge work of contractors who are driven by
competition and financial incentives.
We are still at the dawn of the Internet Age. But cyber attacks have already proven themselves as
a low-cost, high-payoff way to defend national sovereignty and to project national power. Many of
today’s headlines seem to be pulled from the pages of a science fiction novel. Code so sophisticated it
destroys a nuclear centrifuge thousands of miles away. Malware that secretly records everything a user
does on a computer. A software program that steals data from any nearby device that has Bluetooth
connectivity. Encrypted code that decrypts only on one specific, target device. Such sophistication
speaks volumes about the maturity, size, and resources of the organizations behind these attacks. With
a few rare exceptions, these attacks are now in the exclusive realm of nation-states.
“The international community has developed a solid understanding of cyber technology,” said Prof.
Michael N. Schmitt of the U.S. Naval War College, in an email interview. “What is missing is a grasp of
the geopolitical context in which such technology operates. Attribution determinations made without
sensitivity to the geopolitical surroundings are seldom reasonable.”
World War C, like any analogy, has its limits. Cyber war has been compared to special operations
forces, submarine warfare, missiles, assassins, nuclear weapons, Pearl Harbor, 9/11, Katrina, and more.
Even our zombie analogy is not new. Often, any compromised computer, if it is actively under the
surreptitious control of a cybercriminal, is called a zombie, and botnets are sometimes called zombie
armies. Also, compared to stockpiling tanks and artillery, writing cyber attack code, and compromising
thousands if not millions of computers, is easy. Moreover, malware often spreads with the exponential
growth of an infectious disease.
This report examines many publicly known cyber attacks. By exploring some of the distinctive national
or regional characteristics of these attacks, organizations can better identify their attackers, anticipate
future attacks, and defend themselves.

A Word of Warning
The analytical waters surrounding cyber warfare are inherently murky. At the strategic level,
governments desire to have a degree of plausible deniability. At the tactical level, military and
intelligence organizations envelop such operations in layers of classification and secrecy. To be
effective, information operations rely on deception—and the Internet offers an ideal venue for
a spy’s smoke and mirrors. In practical terms, hackers often run their attacks through cyber terrain
(such as compromised, third-party networks) that present investigators with technical and jurisdictional
complications. And finally, cybercriminal tools, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) evolve so quickly that
cyber defense, legislation, and law enforcement remain behind the attacker’s curve.
“The biggest challenge to deterring, defending against, or retaliating for cyber attacks is the problem
of correctly identifying the perpetrator,” said Prof. John Arquilla, Naval Postgraduate School in an email
interview with FireEye.® “Ballistic missiles come with return addresses. But computer viruses, worms, and
denial of service attacks often emanate from behind a veil of anonymity. The best chance to pierce
this veil comes with the skillful blending of forensic back-hacking techniques with deep knowledge of
others’ strategic cultures and their geopolitical aims.”
Cyber “attribution”—identifying a likely culprit, whether an individual, organization, or nation-state—is
notoriously difficult, especially for any single attack. States are often mistakenly identified as non-state
actors, and vice versa. To make matters worse, ties between the two are increasing. First, a growing
number of “patriotic cybercriminals” ostensibly wage cyber war on behalf of governments (examples
include Chechnya and Kosovo in the 1990s, China in 2001, Estonia in 2007, Georgia in 2008, and every
year in the Middle East).1 Second, cybercrime organizations offer anyone, including governments, cyber
attack services to include denial-of-service attacks and access to previously compromised networks.
FireEye researchers have even seen one nation-state develop and use a sophisticated Trojan, and later
(after its own counter-Trojan defenses were in place) sell it to cybercriminals on the black market. Thus,
some cyber attack campaigns may bear the hallmarks of both state and non-state actors, making
positive attribution almost impossible. And finally, “false flag” cyber operations involve a hacker group
behaving like another to mislead cyber defense researchers.

The FireEye Perspective
Within the shadowy world of cyber warfare, FireEye occupies a unique position. First, our threat
protection platform has been installed on thousands of sensitive networks around the world. This gives
our researchers a global and embedded presence in the cyber domain. Second, FireEye devices are
placed behind traditional security defenses such as firewalls, anti-virus, and intrusion prevention systems.
This means that our “false positive” rate is extremely low, and that the attacks we detect have already
succeeded in penetrating external network defenses.

Asia-Pacific
China—the elephant in the room
The People’s Republic of China is the noisiest threat actor in cyberspace. The reasons for this include
its huge population, a rapidly expanding economy, and a lack of good mitigation strategies on the
part of its targets.
Chinese attacks on the U.S.
The list of successful Chinese compromises is long, and spans the entire globe. Here are some of the
most significant incidents in the U.S.:
• Government: By 1999, the U.S. Department of Energy believed that China posed an “acute” threat
to U.S. nuclear security via cyber espionage.2 By 2009, China apparently stole the plans for the most
advanced U.S. fighter jet, the F-35.3
• Technology: China hacked Google, Intel, Adobe, and RSA’s SecureID authentication technology—
with which it then targeted Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and L-3 Communications.4
• Business and Financial Services: Morgan Stanley, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and numerous
banks have been hacked.5
• Media: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, and more have been targeted
by advanced, persistent cyber attacks emanating from China.6
• Critical Infrastructure: Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reported in 2013 that 23 gas
pipeline companies were hacked (possibly for sabotage),7 and that Chinese hackers were seen
at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ National Inventory of Dams.8
Some of these cyber attacks have given China access to proprietary information such as research and
development data. Others offer Chinese intelligence access to sensitive communications, from senior
government officials to Chinese political dissidents.

CHINA

Chinese attacks outside the U.S.
Of course, the U.S. is not China’s only cyber target. All traditional, geopolitical conflicts have moved into
cyberspace, and Chinese compromises encompass the entire globe. But many contests have been
one-sided affairs, with all publicly known attacks emanating from China.
• Europe: In 2006, Chinese cybercriminals targeted the UK House of Commons;9 in 2007, German
Chancellor Angela Merkel raised the problem of nation-state hacking with China’s President;10
in 2010, British MI5 warned that undercover Chinese intelligence officers had given UK business
executives malware-laden digital cameras and memory sticks.11
• India: Indian officials worry that China could disrupt their computer networks during a conflict. One
expert confided that an exclusive reliance on Chinese hardware might give China a “permanent”
denial-of-service capability.12 One sophisticated attack on an Indian Navy headquarters allegedly
used a USB vector to bridge the “air-gap” between a compartmentalized, standalone network and
the Internet.13
• South Korea: The South Korean government has complained for years of Chinese activity on its official
computers, including a 2010 compromise of the personal computers and PDAs belonging to much
of South Korea’s government power structure14 and a 2011 assault on an Internet portal that held
personal information for 35 million Koreans.15
• Japan: Here, the target list includes government, military, and high-tech networks. Chinese
cybercriminals have even stolen classified documents.16

• Australia: China allegedly stole the blueprints for the Australian Security Intelligence Organization’s
new $631 million building.17
• Worldwide: In 2009, Canadian researchers discovered that China controlled a worldwide cyber
espionage network in over 100 countries.18 In 2010, a Chinese telecommunications firm transmitted
erroneous routing information for 37,000 computer networks, which misrouted some Internet traffic
through China for 20 minutes. The attack exposed data from 8,000 U.S. networks, 1,100 Australian
networks, and 230 French networks.19

Chinese cyber tactics
The People’s Republic of China (PRC) is home to 1.35 billion people, or more than four times the
population of the United States. Therefore, China often has the ability to overwhelm cyber defenses with
quantity over quality, just as it did in the Korean War and as it might do in any other type of conflict.
The Chinese malware that FireEye researchers have analyzed is not the most advanced or creative.
But in many circumstances, it has been no less effective. China employs brute-force attacks that are
often the most inexpensive way to accomplish its objectives. The attacks succeed due to the sheer
volume of attacks, the prevalence and persistence of vulnerabilities in modern networks, and a seeming
indifference on the part of the cybercriminals to being caught.

The “Comment Crew,”20 a prominent example of a Chinese cyber threat actor, is believed to be a
contractor to the PRC government. The Comment Crew is behind many noteworthy attacks, including
Operation Beebus, which targets U.S. aerospace and defense industries.21
One important characteristic of the Comment Crew—which puts it definitively in the category of an
advanced persistent threat, or APT—is that it is a bureaucracy. In-depth analysis reveals a small group
of creative and strategic thinkers at the top. One layer down, a larger group of specialists design and
produce malware in an industrial fashion. At the bottom are the foot soldiers—brute-force hackers who
execute orders and wage extended cyber attack campaigns, from network reconnaissance to spear
phishing to data exfiltration. The Comment Crew is so large, in fact, that when the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) decoded one of the group’s stolen caches of information, if printed out, it would
have created a stack of paper taller than a set of encyclopedias.22
Such a large bureaucracy helps to explain sometimes-incongruous cybercriminal behavior. A given
piece of malware, for example, may have been written by an expert but incorrectly used later by an
inexperienced foot soldier (such as a poorly written spear phishing email). Understanding this cyber
attack life cycle and its different stages can help cyber defenders recognize and foil an attack. In any
large organization, some processes are less mature than others, and therefore easier to recognize.

Chinese cyber defense
In its own defense, Chinese officials contend that their country is also a target of cyber attacks. In 2006,
the China Aerospace Science & Industry Corporation (CASIC) found spyware on its classified network.23
In 2007, the Chinese Ministry of State Security stated that foreign cybercriminals were stealing Chinese
information, with 42 percent of attacks coming from Taiwan and 25 percent from the United States.24
In 2009, Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao announced that a cybercriminal from Taiwan had stolen
his upcoming report to the National People’s Congress.25 In 2013, Edward Snowden, a former system
administrator at the National Security Agency (NSA), published documents suggesting that the U.S.
conducted cyber espionage against China;26 and the Chinese Computer Emergency Response Team
(CERT) stated that it possessed “mountains of data” on cyber attacks by the U.S.27

North Korea—the upstart
North and South Korea remain locked in one of the most intractable conflicts on Earth. North Korea
(supported by China) would seem to be stuck in a cyber Stone Age—especially relative to South Korea
(supported by the U.S.)—has the fastest download speeds in the world28 and will issue its students with
computer tablets instead of books by 2015.29 Even so, the Internet offers anyone, and any nation, an
asymmetric way to gather intelligence and project national power in cyberspace—and North Korea
appears to have acquired cyber attacks as a new weapon for its arsenal.
In 2009, North Korea launched its first major assault on South Korean and U.S. government websites. The
attack did little damage, but the incident gained wide media exposure.30 By 2013, however, the threat
actors had matured. A group dubbed the “DarkSeoul Gang” was responsible for at least four years of
high-profile attacks on South Korea. The group’s attacks included a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)
attack and malicious code that wiped computer hard drives at banks, media, ISPs, telcos, and financial
services companies—overwriting legitimate data with political messages. In the Korean conflict, such
incidents often take place on dates of historical significance, including July 4, the U.S. Independence
Day.31 Suspected North Korean attacks on U.S. institutions include U.S. military elements based in South
Korea, the U.S.-based Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, and even the White House.
North Korean defectors have described a burgeoning cyberwarfare department of 3,000 personnel,
largely trained in China and Russia. The defectors stressed that North Korea has a growing
fascinationwith cyber attacks as a cost-effective way to compete against its conventionally superior
foes. They believe that North Korea is growing increasingly comfortable and confident in this new
warfare domain, assessing that the Internet is not only vulnerable to attack but that this strategy can
create psychological pressure on the West. Toward this end, North Korea has focused on disconnecting
its important servers from the Internet, while building a dedicated “attack network.”32
FireEye researchers have seen a heavy use of spear phishing and the construction of a “watering hole,”
in which an important website is hacked in the hope of compromising the computers of its subsequent
visitors, who usually belong to a certain VIP-profile the attacker is targeting. Some North Korean attacks
have begun to manipulate a victim’s operating system settings and disable their anti-virus software—
techniques that are normally characteristic of Russian cybercriminals. In other words, North Korean
hackers may have learned from or have contracted support in Russia.
Apart from any possible disruption or destruction stemming from cyber attacks, computer network
operations are an invaluable tool for collecting sensitive information, especially when it resides on
government or think-tank networks normally inaccessible from the Internet. North Korea, China, and
Russia are all naturally interested in collecting cyber intelligence that would increase their comparative
advantage in classified information, diplomatic negotiating positions, or future policy changes.

At the same time, North Korea also asserts that it is a target of cyber attacks from South Korea and the
U.S. In June 2013, when the North suffered a two-day outage of all of its in-country websites, its state
news agency denounced “concentrated and persistent virus attacks,” and proclaimed that the U.S.
and South Korea “will have to take the responsibility for the whole consequences.” The North noted that
the attack took place in parallel with Key Resolve (joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises), but the
U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff denied any connection.33

India-Pakistan: old rivals, new tactics
A heavily fortified border separates India and Pakistan on the map. But the quiet, borderless nature
of cyberspace means both sides are free to engage in cyber warfare—even during peacetime.
In 2009, India announced that Pakistani cybercriminals had placed malware on popular Indian music
download sites as a clever, indirect way to compromise Indian systems.34 In 2010, the “Pakistani Cyber
Army” defaced and subsequently shut down the website of the Central Bureau of Investigation, India’s
top police agency.35 In 2012, over 100 Indian government websites were compromised.36
Not to be outdone, in 2013, cybercriminals in India undertook “Operation Hangover,” a large-scale
Indian cyber espionage campaign that hit Pakistani IT, mining, automotive, legal, engineering, food
service, military, and financial services networks.37 Although researchers could not definitively tie the
attacks to India’s government, many of the targets represented the country’s national security interests.38

Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN): emerging economies as soft targets
Since at least 2010, many APTs (likely China-based) have targeted the governments, militaries, and
businesses of ASEAN, the Southeast Asian geopolitical and economic group composed of Brunei,
Burma (Myanmar), Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.
Although chances of any regional war erupting in the near term are low, a large volume of ongoing,
regional cyber espionage activity is a constant. Targeted industries include telecommunications,
transportation, oil and gas, banks, and think tanks. The usual motivation is to gain tactical or strategic
advantage within the political, military, and economic domains.39
FireEye researchers are following numerous APT actors in this region, including BeeBus, Mirage, Check
Command, Taidoor, Seinup, and Naikon. Their most common tactic is spear phishing, often using
legitimate decoy documents that are related to the target’s national economy or politics, or to regional
events such as ASEAN summits, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summits, energy exploration,
or military affairs.

FireEye believes that many of these regional economic organizations are attractive targets for APT
campaigns because the information they possess is valuable and their level of cyber security awareness
is low. Often, these organizations have inconsistent system administration, infrequent software patch
management, poor policy control, or some combination of these issues. Thus, many of these networks
are “low-hanging fruit” for attackers. And to make matters worse, compromised systems are used as
staging grounds for further attacks on regional targets, by installing illicit command-and-control (CnC)
servers, abusing legitimate email accounts, and disseminating stolen office documents as “bait.”

Russia/Eastern Europe

Russia—a little bit “too quiet?”
In 1939, Winston Churchill declared that Russia was a “riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma …”.
Seven decades later, cyber defense researchers would say that not much has changed. Compared
with the constant attacks detected from China, you can almost hear the snow falling on Red Square.
One of the outstanding questions in cyber security today is: Where are the Russians? Perhaps they are
simply great hackers. Maybe they have sufficient human intelligence. Whatever the reason, cyber
defense analysts often look in vain for the traces of Russian cybercriminals. As a step toward finding
some answers, however, consider the second half of Churchill’s quote: “… but perhaps there is a key—
that key is Russian national interest.”40 In other words, where there is smoke, there is usually fire.
In the mid-1990s, at the very dawn of the World Wide Web, Russia was engaged in a protracted struggle
over the fate of Chechnya; the Chechens became pioneers in cyber propaganda, and the Russians
became pioneers is shutting down their websites. In 1998, when Russian ally Serbia was under attack from
NATO, pro-Serbian hackers jumped in the fray, targeting NATO with DoS attacks and at least twenty-five
strains of virus-infected email. In 2007, Russia was the prime suspect in the most famous international cyber
attack to date—the punitive DDoS on Estonia for moving a Soviet-era statue.41
In 2008, researchers uncovered clear evidence that computer network operations played a supporting
role in Russian military advances during its invasion of Georgia.42 Also in 2008, Russia was suspected in
what U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense William Lynn called the “most significant breach of U.S. military
computers ever”—an attack on Central Command (CENTCOM), delivered through an infected USB
drive.43 In 2009, Russian cybercriminals were blamed in “Climategate,” a breach of university research
intended to undermine international negotiations on climate change mitigation.44 In 2010, NATO and
the European Union warned of increased Russian cyber attacks, while the FBI arrested and deported a
possible Russian intelligence agent named Alexey Karetnikov, who had been working as a software
tester at Microsoft.45

One ironic aspect of nation-state cyber attacks—especially in authoritarian countries—is that many
of them are inward facing. In 2012, Russian security firm Kaspersky Lab announced the discovery of
“Red October,”46 a cyber attack campaign that spied on millions of citizens around the world, but
chiefly within the former Soviet Union. Targets included embassies, research firms, military bases, energy
providers, nuclear agencies, and critical infrastructure.47 Similarly, in 2013, researchers found malware
on millions of Android devices in Russia and in Russian-speaking countries. Either or both of these attacks
could be partially explained as the Russian government keeping an eye on its own population, and that
of neighboring countries.48
On the brighter side, as a step toward cyber détente, the U.S. and Russia in 2013 signed an agreement
to build a cyber “hotline”—similar to that used for nuclear scares during the Cold War—to help defuse
any computer-related crises in the future.49 But, just to be on the safe side, Russia is taking the extreme
cyber defense measure of buying old-fashioned typewriters,50 and the Russian military is (like the U.S.,
China, and Israel) creating cyber warfare-focused units.51

Russian tactics
Though relatively quiet, Russia appears to be home to many of the most complex and advanced
cyber attacks FireEye researchers have seen. More specifically, Russian exploit code can be significantly
stealthier than its Chinese counterpart—which can also make it more worrisome. The “Red October”
campaign, including its satellite software dubbed “Sputnik,” is a prominent example of likely
Russian malware.
TTP often includes the delivery of weaponized email attachments, though Russian cybercriminals
appear to be adept at changing their attack patterns, exploits, and data exfiltration methods to
evade detection. In fact, one telltale aspect of Russian hackers seems to be that, unlike the Chinese,
they go to extraordinary lengths to hide their identities and objectives. FireEye analysts have even
seen examples in which they have run “false-flag” cyber operations, designing their attack to appear
as if it came from Asia.

One further problem for cyber defense researchers is that some Russian back doors into compromised
systems are hard to distinguish from advanced cybercriminal break-ins.

Middle East
As a region, the Middle East may not possess the arsenal of zero-day exploits available in Russia, or
the brute-force numbers of China. Therefore, some Middle Eastern hackers may have to rely on cyber
tactics that emphasize novelty, creativity, and deception.
For example, the 2012 Mahdi campaign, which infected targets in the Middle East, used malicious
Word documents, PowerPoint files, and PDFs to infect targets. That approach is similar to many other
attackers. But these attacks were accompanied by some imaginative elements such as games,
attractive images, and custom animations specifically designed to aid in the attack.
Not only did they trick users into executing commands to install malicious code, but they also distracted
users from seeing malware-related warning messages. Furthermore, Mahdi attacks were tailored to
specific target audiences—for example by offering variations of games unique to each organization.
Such pinpoint strikes rely on prior reconnaissance, help to evade cyber defense behavioral-detection
mechanisms, and dramatically increase the odds of compromise. So in the Middle East, the relative
sophistication of an attack may be calculated less in the technology, and more in the clever ways in
which malware is delivered and installed on a target network.

Iran: a “hot” cyber war
Wherever significant activity erupts in the real world (including crime, espionage, and warfare), parallel
activity unfolds in cyberspace. It is therefore unsurprising that Iran—which has tense international
relations and is on the verge of acquiring a nuclear bomb—has also experienced the most
sophisticated cyber attacks to date.
In 2010, Stuxnet was a “cyber missile” of sorts designed with painstaking precision to burrow deep
into Iran’s nuclear program and destroy physical infrastructure. To some degree, this piece of software
replaced a squadron of fighter aircraft that would have violated foreign airspace, dropped laserguided bombs, and left a smoking crater in the Earth’s surface.52 Beyond Stuxnet, other advanced
espionage attacks have worried security experts, including Duqu, Flame, and Gauss, which all may
have come from the same threat actor.53 And even amateurs are successfully targeting Iran; although
the “Mahdi” malware is by comparison far less sophisticated than Stuxnet and its cousins, Mahdi has
still managed to compromise engineering firms, government agencies, financial services firms, and
academia throughout the Middle East.54

So how does anyone, including a nation-state, respond to a cyber attack? Does the counterstrike
remain within the cyber realm, or can it come in the form of a traditional military (or terrorist) assault? In
2012, Iran appears to have chosen the first option. A hacker group called the “Cutting Sword of Justice”
used the “Shamoon” virus to attack the Saudi Arabian national oil company Aramco, deleting data on
three-quarters of Aramco’s corporate PCs (including documents, spreadsheets, e-mails, and files) and
replacing them with an image of a burning American flag.55 And over the past year, another group
called Izz ad-Din al-Qassam launched “Operation Ababil,” a series of DDoS attacks against many U.S.
financial institutions including the New York Stock Exchange.56
Other examples of cyber attacks abound. In 2009, the plans for a new U.S. Marine Corps 1 presidential
helicopter were found on a file-sharing network in Iran.57 In 2010, the “Iranian Cyber Army” disrupted
Twitter and the Chinese search engine Baidu, redirecting users to Iranian political messages.58 In 2011,
Iranian attackers compromised a Dutch digital certificate authority, after which it issued more than
500 fraudulent certificates for major companies and government agencies.59 In 2012, Iran disrupted
the BBC’s Persian Language Service, and University of Toronto researchers reported that some versions
of the Simurgh “proxy” software (which is popular in countries like Iran and anonymizes Internet traffic)
also installed a Trojan that collected usernames and keystrokes, sending them to a likely intelligence
collection site.60 Finally, in 2013 the Wall Street Journal reported that Iranian actors had increased their
efforts to compromise U.S. critical infrastructure.61

Syria: what is the Syrian Electronic Army?
Syria is in the midst of a civil war, so researchers have a lot of cyber activity to analyze. The most
prominent hacker group by far is the Syrian Electronic Army (SEA), which is loyal to Syrian President
Bashar al-Assad. SEA has conducted DDoS attacks, phishing, pro-Assad defacements, and spamming
campaigns against governments, online services, and media that are perceived to be hostile to
the Syrian government. SEA has hacked Al-Jazeera, Anonymous, Associated Press (AP), BBC, Daily
Telegraph, Financial Times, Guardian, Human Rights Watch, National Public Radio, The New York Times,
Twitter, and more.62 Its most famous exploit was a hoax announcement using AP’s Twitter account that
the White House was bombed and President Obama injured—after which stock markets briefly dipped
to the tune of $200 billion.63

In the month of July 2013 alone, SEA compromised three widely used online communications websites:
Truecaller (the world’s largest telephone directory),64 Tango (a video and text messaging service),65 and
Viber (a free online calling and messaging application).66 These types of compromises are significant
because they can give Syrian intelligence access to the communications of millions of people, including
political activists within Syria who might then be targeted for espionage, intimidation, and arrest.
To compromise its targets, the SEA often sends socially engineered, spear-phishing emails to lure
opposition activists into opening fraudulent, weaponized, and malicious documents. If the recipient falls
for the scam, Trojan horse, remote access tool (RAT) software is installed on the victim’s computer that
can give the attacker keystrokes, screenshots, microphone and webcam recordings, stolen documents,
and passwords. And of course, the SEA likely sends all of this information to a computer address lying
within Syrian government-controlled Internet Protocol (IP) space for intelligence collection and review.67

Israel: old conflict, new tactics
Even during the Cold War, the Arab-Israeli conflict saw many hot wars, and it was often the testing
ground for new military weapons and tactics. Nothing has changed in the Internet era. Since at least
2000, pro-Israeli hackers have targeted sites of political and military significance in the Middle East.68
In 2007, Israel reportedly disrupted Syrian air defense networks via cyber attack (with some collateral
damage to its own domestic networks) to facilitate the Israeli Air Force’s destruction of an alleged
Syrian nuclear facility.69

But as an advanced industrial nation, Israel also depends on information technology. The nation has
proven to be vulnerable to cyber attacks, which often target the Israeli economy. In 2009, during Israel’s
military operation in Gaza, hackers briefly paralyzed many government sites with a DDoS attack from at
least 500,000 computers. The 2009 attack consisted of four independent waves, each stronger than the
last, peaking at 15 million junk mail deliveries per second. The Israeli “Home Front Command” website,
which plays a key role in national defense communications with the public, was down for three hours.
Due to technical similarities with the 2008 cyber attack on Georgia during its war with Russia, Israeli
officials surmised that the attack itself might have been carried out by a criminal organization in the
former Soviet Union, and paid for by Hamas or Hezbollah.70
Often, the trouble with cyber attacks is that they do not need to be highly sophisticated to succeed,
even against security-conscious Israel. In 2012, the ineptly written71 “Mahdi” malware compromised at
least 54 targets in Israel.72 Last but not least, in 2013, the Iranian media reported that the Syrian army had
carried out a cyber attack against the water supply of the Israeli city of Haifa. Prof. Isaac Ben-Israel, a
cyber security adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said that the report was false, but added
that cyber attacks on critical infrastructures pose a “real and present threat” to Israel.73

The West
United States
Analysts believe that the U.S. has conducted the most highly engineered cyber attacks to date,
including Stuxnet,74 Duqu, Flame, and Gauss.75 This family of malware is unparalleled in its complexity
and targeting. Stuxnet in particular was developed with a singular goal (to disrupt Iranian nuclear
enrichment) that was both narrowly focused and capable of yielding strategic gains in the international
arena. In contrast to computer worms such as Slammer and Code Red, Stuxnet did not seek to
compromise as many computers as possible, but as few as possible. Even more amazing, its malicious
behavior was concealed under a veneer of apparently legitimate operational data—but ultimately,
the malware destroyed Iranian centrifuges.
This family of malware was exquisitely designed. For example, its payload can arrive at its destination
encrypted—and become decrypted and installed only on a target device. This helps the malware to
evade the prying eyes of cyber defenders, making discovering and reverse engineering the malware
much more difficult.
Ironically, this family of malware could be a paragon of over-engineering. For example, it not only
uses multiple zero-day exploits, but also world-first computational achievements such as a forced
cryptographic “hash collision.”76 In the case of Iran (which is currently subject to a trade embargo
that restricts its acquisition of high technology), it is doubtful whether Iranian software is up-to-date or
properly configured. So the authors of Stuxnet could likely have used more conventional computer
exploits and still succeeded.

Table 4: Characteristics
of Western cyber attacks

One possible telling aspect of U.S. cyber attacks: they require such a high level of financial investment,
technical sophistication, and legal oversight that they will stand out from the crowd. On the last point,
Richard Clarke, who served three U.S. Presidents as a senior counterterrorism official, argued that Stuxnet
was a U.S. operation because “it very much had the feel to it of having been written by or governed
by a team of Washington lawyers.”77 Finally, the amount of work involved in these operations suggests
the participation of an enormous defense contractor base, with different companies specializing in
particular aspects of a large and complex undertaking.
On the downside (and similar to the Israeli case), all advanced industrial economies are vulnerable
to cyber counterattack. In 2008, a CIA official informed a conference of critical infrastructure providers
that unknown cybercriminals, on multiple occasions, had been able to disrupt the power supply in
various foreign cities.78 In the military domain, Iraqi insurgents used $26 off-the-shelf software to intercept
live video feeds from U.S. Predator drones, likely giving them the ability to monitor and evade U.S.
military operations.79 In the economic sphere, the U.S.-based International Monetary Fund (IMF) fell
victim to a phishing attack in 2011 that was described as a “very major breach.”80
Thus, while cyber attacks are relatively a new phenomenon, they represent a growing national security
challenge. As part of a broader effort to mitigate the threat, President Obama signed a directive in
2013 that the U.S. should aid allies who come under foreign cyber attack.81

Europe
No prominent examples have been discovered of the European Union (EU) or the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) conducting their own offensive cyber attacks. On the contrary, their leaders have
so far foresworn them.82 But many examples reveal European networks getting hacked from other parts
of the world, particularly China and Russia.
Within government, cyber attacks on the British Foreign Ministry evaded network defenses in 2010 by
pretending to come from the White House.83 In 2011, German Police found that servers used to locate
serious criminals and terrorism suspects had been penetrated, initially via a phishing attack.84 Also in 2011,
European Commission officials were targeted at an Internet Governance Forum (IGF) in Azerbaijan.85
In the military sphere, in 2009, French Navy planes were grounded following an infection by the
Conficker worm.86 In 2012, the UK admitted that cybercriminals had penetrated its classified Ministry of
Defense networks.87
In business, the European Union’s carbon trading market was breached in 2011, resulting in the theft
of more than $7 million in credits, forcing the market to shut down temporarily.88 In 2012, the European
Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS) and German steelmaker ThyssenKrupp fell victim to
major attacks by Chinese cybercriminals.89
Security professionals should particularly be on the lookout for APT cyber threats just before and during
international negotiations. In 2011 alone, the European Commission complained of widespread hacking
before an EU summit,90 the French government was compromised prior to a G-20 meeting,91 and at
least 10 Norwegian defense and energy companies were breached during large-scale contract
negotiations, via phishing that was specifically tailored to each company.92

Conclusion
World War Z told a story of idiosyncratic national behavior in response to a major international crisis.
This report sought to highlight the same phenomenon in regard to the challenges posed by national
cyber insecurity and international cyber attacks. Behind every incident is an agenda—and individual
human beings—each unique and ultimately identifiable. The bigger the cyber campaign, the more
data it generates for security researchers, and the more difficulty attackers will have remaining
anonymous and hiding their agenda.
As for crystal balls: no one knows what the next cyber attack will look like. But considering recent trends,
we can make a few educated guesses.
Here are five factors that could change the world’s cyber security landscape in the near- to medium-term:
1. Outage of national critical infrastructure: we know that cyber attacks can disrupt government
networks, but most current cases simply do not rise to the level of a national security threat. Stuxnet—
and Iran’s alleged retaliation against Saudi Aramco—has shifted the thinking on cyber war from
theory to something closer to reality. But have we seen the limit of what cyber attacks can achieve,
or could cybercriminals threaten public safety by downing a power grid or financial market?
2. Cyber arms treaty: if world leaders begin to view cyber attacks as more of a liability than an
opportunity, they may join a cyber arms control regime or sign a non-aggression pact for
cyberspace. However, arms control requires the ability to inspect for a prohibited item. President
Reagan’s favorite Russian proverb was доверяй, но проверяй, or “trust but verify.” Given that a single
USB stick can now hold billions of bits of information, verifying would be easier said than done.
3. PRISM, freedom of speech, and privacy: we are still at the dawn of the Internet era, and this
conversation has only just begun. It encompasses Daniel Ellsberg, Chelsea Manning, and Edward
Snowden, as well as the Declaration of Independence, Enigma, and The Onion Router (TOR). Today,
politicians, spooks, and hippies are all aware of a critical debate on the horizon—just how much
online privacy should we have?
4. New actors on the cyber stage: the revolutionary nature of computers and the amplification power
of networks are not exclusive to the world’s largest nations. Iran, Syria, North Korea, and even nonstate actors such as Anonymous have employed cyber attacks as a way to conduct diplomacy and
wage war by other means. Researchers have little reason to think that other governments are not
active in this domain. Possible candidates could be:
		a. Poland: it was the Poles who first broke the German Enigma cipher—way back in 1932!
		 Today, with programming talent and well-known rivalry with Russia, it is a possibility.
		b. Brazil: Home to some of the world’s most prolific cybercriminals, will Brazil’s government,
		 be angry about recent revelations of U.S. cyber spying, harness this talent for geopolitical ends?
		c. Taiwan: with constant cyber attacks emanating from Mainland China, Taipei may have
		 little choice but to react.
5. Stronger focus on evasion: as we have seen, some nation-states know how to launch stealthy cyber
attacks. But as the discipline of cyber defense matures, and as public awareness of the World War C
phenomenon grows, some “noisy” cyber attackers such as China may be forced to raise their game
by trying to fly under a more finely tuned radar.

The analysis and conclusions drawn in this paper are conjectural. Cyber security, cyber espionage,
and cyber war are new and rapidly evolving concepts. Furthermore, most computer network
operations are shrouded in secrecy. Deception is a given.
“A cyber attack, viewed outside of its geopolitical context, allows very little legal maneuvering room
for the defending state,” said Prof. Thomas Wingfield of the Marshall Center, in a recent email interview
with FireEye. “False flag operations and the very nature of the Internet make tactical attribution a
losing game.”
But Wingfield adds that strategic attribution—fusing all sources of intelligence on a potential threat—
allows a much higher level of confidence and more options for government decision makers.
“And strategic attribution begins and ends with geopolitical analysis,” he said.
With this in mind, we hope that an awareness of this World War C dynamic helps cyber security
professionals better understand, identify, and combat cyber attacks in the future.
