Introduction:
Earlier today, IDF’s spokesperson revealed that IDF (Israel Defense Force) and ISA (Israel
Security Agency AKA “Shin Bet”) conducted a joint operation to take down a Hamas
operation targeting IDF soldiers, dubbed ‘Rebound’.
In this article, we will describe the capabilities and provide technical analysis of the malware
used, along with the attack’s affiliation to APT-C-23, a hacking group with previously reported
attacks in the Middle East
Technical Analysis:
This MRAT (Mobile Remote Access Trojan) is disguised as a set of dating apps, “GrixyApp”,
“ZatuApp”, and “Catch&See”, all with dedicated websites, and descriptions of dating
applications.

The victims received a link to download the malicious application from a Hamas operator
disguising themselves as an attractive woman. Once the application is installed and
executed, it shows an error message stating that the device is not supported, and the app
will uninstall itself – which actually does not happen, and the app only hides its icon.

While hidden, the application communicates with the same server it was downloaded from,
using the MQTT protocol.
The main functionality of this malware is to collect data on the victim such as phone number,
location, SMS messages and more, while having the capability to extend its code via a
received command. The command can provide the application with a URL to a DEX file,
which is then downloaded and executed.

Affiliation:
The tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used in this new wave of attacks are similar
to ones used in the past by previous APT-C-23 campaigns.
First, the threat group develops backdoors for Android devices that are usually disguised as
chatting applications.

Second, dedicated and specially crafted websites are set up by the threat group to promote
those backdoors, explain their functionality, and offer a direct link to download them. Those
domains, and others that are used for C&C communications by known APT-C-23 samples,
are usually registered using NameCheap, and this was also the case with the newly
discovered websites.
Lastly, malicious samples affiliated with APT-C-23 made references to names of actors, TV
characters and celebrities both in their source code and C&C communication. Although the
new backdoors lacked those references, we were able to see name of celebrities and known
figures such as Jim Morrison, Eliza Doolittle, Gretchen Bleiler and Dolores Huerta in the
backdoor’s website, catchansee[.]com.

This campaign serves as a sharp reminder that effort from system developers alone is not
enough to build a secure Android eco-system. It requires attention and action from system
developers, device manufacturers, app developers, and users, so that vulnerability fixes are
patched, distributed, adopted and installed in time.
It is also another example for why organizations and consumers alike should have an
advanced mobile threat prevention solution installed on the device to protect themselves
against the possibility of unknowingly installing malicious apps, even from trusted app stores.
