Sonoluminescence is a captivating phenomenon that bridges the worlds of acoustics and optics, revealing the unexpected ways in which different physical phenomena can intersect. The fact that light can be emitted from the collapse of a sound-driven bubble challenges our intuition about how energy is transferred and processed in various states of matter.

Here's another fascinating fact from physics that doesn't include any of the previously mentioned facts:

The Meissner effect, also known as the Meissner-Ochsenius effect, is a defining characteristic of superconductivity. It was discovered by Walther Meissner and Robert Ochsenius in 1933 when they observed that certain materials undergoing a phase transition to a superconducting state expel magnetic fields from their interior.

In normal conductors, currents induced by an external magnetic field create circulating loops of magnetic flux within the material, known as eddy currents. However, in a superconductor below its critical temperature, the presence of a magnetic field actually enhances the superconductivity by aligning the electron pairs more closely with the applied field. This alignment leads to a complete expulsion of the magnetic field from the bulk of the material, a phenomenon known as perfect diamagnetism.

The Meissner effect is one of the hallmarks of the BCS theory of superconductivity, which describes how Cooper pairs form due to the attractive interaction between electrons mediated by phonons at low temperatures. This pairing mechanism allows for the flow of electrical current with zero resistance and the expulsion of magnetic fields, as described by the London equations.

The Meissner effect is not only a fundamental property of superconductors but also has practical applications in devices such as superconducting magnets, which can achieve extremely high magnetic fields without any power input once they are established, thanks to the complete absence of resistance in the superconducting material.

In summary, the Meissner effect demonstrates the counterintuitive behavior of matter at very low temperatures and is a cornerstone of our understanding of the quantum mechanical properties of superconductors.
