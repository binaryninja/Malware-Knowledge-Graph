The Meissner effect is a striking demonstration of the unique properties of superconductors, where the expulsion of magnetic fields leads to the creation of perfect diamagnetic materials. This phenomenon has not only revolutionized our understanding of quantum mechanics but also paved the way for numerous technological advancements in fields such as magnet levitation trains and medical imaging.
