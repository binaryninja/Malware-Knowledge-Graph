HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2020/2021

INTRODUCTION

As the world continues to be rocked
by an unpredictable pandemic, with borders still closed, businesses struggling
to stay afloat, and political confrontations becoming increasingly hostile,
one thing has remained constant: The
steady growth of cybercrime.
For 17 years, Group-IB has dedicated
its efforts to investigating cybercrime,
monitoring the evolution of attackers’
tactics and instruments, and developing
innovative technologies to hunt for and
eliminate cyber threats. The company
actively shares its insights and investigations with the expert community and
general public, and this expertise culminates in the annual Group-IB Hi-Tech
Crime Trends report.
In their new report, Hi-Tech Crime
Trends 2020-2021, Group-IB experts
name the key changes that have
occurred in the field of high-tech crime,
revealing the inner workings of the
cybercrime underground, communication between different threat groups,
and affiliate programs that sell malware and other malicious services.
Traditionally, Group-IB investigates not
only attacks on the commercial sector
but also those on critical infrastructure.
The latter are typically the result of covert activities conducted by the special
services of various countries around the
world.
Hi-Tech Crime Trends gives you access
to the most complete trove of strategic
data and detailed information on active
cyber threats. By reading the report,
you will get the answer to these burning
questions:
— Who are your enemies
in cyberspace?
— How do they operate today?
— How will their toolkits adapt for
future attacks?
— How can you protect yourself
against them?
Armed with this knowledge, companies
worldwide, regardless of industry, will
be able to build more effective cybersecurity strategies.

The paralysis of entire economic
sectors, mass transition to remote
work, and widespread layoffs have led
to a surge in cybercriminal activity.
Threat actors have taken advantage
of the unique global situation and
become more creative, developing increasingly elaborate schemes
to achieve their illicit goals. In the spring
of 2020, Group-IB experts predicted
that there would be a growth in the
number of financial crimes, and cyberattacks on the computers, computer
equipment (routers, web cameras), and
unprotected networks of at-home workers. Those employees working in financial institutions, telecom operators,
and IT companies would be the primary
targets. Unfortunately, the predictions
were right.

The market for Cybercrime-as-a-Service
is actively developing. The phenomenon directly correlates with the renting
out of computer networks that are
infected with malware (botnets) and
used for organizing DDoS attacks,
sending phishing emails, and providing
proxy servers. There have emerged new
sellers of network access who form
partnerships with ransomware operators and APT groups that have shifted
their focus from bank theft to working
with private affiliate programs. Statesponsored threat actors have likewise
jumped on bandwagon, opening the
doors of corporate infrastructure to ransomware. This threat has become larger
than life and can no longer be ignored
by any company, no matter its industry
or geographic location.

During the pandemic, Group-IB analysts
noticed a spike in the number of cyberattacks originating from state-sponsored threat actors and criminals using
spyware, ransomware, and backdoors
to exploit people’s fears and anxiety
over the coronavirus. The analysts also
noted that attackers actively looked
for ways get into enterprise networks,
a goal they achieved by infecting the
computers of remote workers with
malware.

We are confident that with the constant exchange of information, joint
efforts to maintain stability in the
global cyberspace, and the creation and
development of partnerships between
private companies and international law
enforcement agencies, we can effectively combat cybercrime. By raising
the global community’s awareness
of cybercrime, we can help preserve
and protect the opportunities cyberspace give us.

While the overall number of successful targeted attacks on banks went
down, Group-IB analysts discovered
a shocking increase in the use of social
engineering to commit fraud. The main
attack vectors are vishing and phishing,
whose victims are mainly bank customers. The fraudsters’ main goal is still
to steal money and information that can
be sold, but they go about it in a new
way.
The past year saw the majority of cybercriminal groups switch to working with
ransomware. With ransomware in their
arsenal, attackers are able to earn
no less than they would in a successful
bank attack and with a much easier
technical execution. Big Game Hunting,
or attacking large companies with the
aim of collecting the largest possible
ransom, is gaining momentum. New
groups are joining the game and creating dangerous affiliations and partnerships in the cybercrime underworld.

KEY FINDINGS
AND FORECASTS

group-ib.com

HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2020/2021

→ Key findings and Forecasts

Ransomware attacks
Current threats
The main goal:
create access to corporate networks
for ransomware purposes

Ransomware affiliate
programs shape the market of corporate
network access for sale

— Over the past year, seven new
ransomware affiliate programs have
emerged (bringing the total to 15),
which has shaped the market of corporate network access for sale.
— Between H2 2019 and H1 2020, the
number of access for sale offers has
increased 2.6-fold (from 138 to 362)
compared to the previous period.
— There are more and more users who
actively sell access to corporate networks. In 2019, there were 50 active
sellers; in the first half of 2020,
Group-IB identified 63.
— Owners of the banking botnets
TrickBot, Qbot, Silent Night, and RTM
have started using their botnets
to deploy ransomware.
— The cybercriminal groups Cobalt
and Silence, which had previously focused on targeted attacks
on banks, have presumably joined
ransomware affiliate programs.

— Primitive errors (such as vulnerable
software versions in public services
or weak passwords) pose one of the
most serious risks to companies.
If a vulnerable system is compromised, adversaries will usually
attempt to inflict as much damage
to the business as possible, followed
by extortion.
— Ten ransomware affiliate programs
involve brute-force attacks on servers accessible externally through
Remote Desktop Services. Three programs exploit vulnerabilities in VPN
services.
— New botnets that perform distributed brute-force attacks on remote
access interfaces (RDP, SSH, VPN)
and other services have been
identified.
— One of the most common ways
that victims are tricked into paying
ransoms is stealing data from the
network and threatening to leak the
information online.
— In an effort to increase their profits, some groups have conducted
auctions to sell stolen data instead
of publishing it online.
— Ransomware proved so popular that
criminals began to publish readymade ransomware-as-a-service
(RaaS) projects for Linux, MacOS, and
Windows (e.g., the RAASNet project)
on websites such as GitHub.

— Cybercriminals have mainly used
two post-exploitation frameworks
to move laterally and gain control
over targeted corporate networks:
a free tool called Metasploit and
a cracked version of Cobalt Strike.
Less often, adversaries used the
frameworks PoshC2 and Koadic.
During the reporting period,
Group-IB experts identified more
than 10,000 hosts with these frameworks installed. Between H2 2018
and H1 2019, Group-IB researchers
identified around 6,000 such hosts.
— The countries attacked the most
often were the USA, the UK, Canada,
France, and Germany. They suffered
381 attacks out of 505, i.e. 75%.
— The most attacked sector was manufacturing. Half of all attacks targeted
entities in the manufacturing, trade,
government, healthcare, construction, and academic sectors.
— Group-IB identified cases of threat
actors using new ransomware
designed to disrupt processes
associated with industrial network applications. Such tools help
cybercriminals encrypt valuable
data at manufacturing plants more
effectively.

— The number of ransomware affiliate
programs will grow for a brief time
only. Group-IB expects that the
market will stabilize and that numbers will stop increasing by the end
of 2020.
— There may be cases of ransomware
attacks targeting company mail systems. Hackers are likely to steal data
from local mail servers and disable
the mail system — bearing in mind
that stable email communications
are critical to businesses. This may
lead to cloud mail services becoming
more popular and the on-prem mail
storage model being abandoned.
— Groups that focus on attacks

on SCADA systems at industrial
enterprises in order to manipulate
production processes may emerge.
— Intelligence services may be interested in owners of affiliate programs
and use them to access networks
of interest.
— To inflict maximum damage on entities and divert attention away from
their attacks, special services may
start mimicking criminals by spreading documents that undermine the
attacked organization’s business
operations or by selling access to the
affected corporate networks.

Forecasts
— Group-IB expects that specialized
trading platforms will emerge for
exhibiting lots with access to corporate networks, which may lead
to even more related incidents.
— We expect that there will be more
demand for Linux malware designed
to achieve persistence in the network
and escalate privileges.
— IoT botnet owners may start selling
access to devices installed on corporate networks.
— New botnets and related criminal
services for distributed brute-force
attacks on remote control interfaces
will emerge.

Military operations
Current threats
More and more often
espionage is replaced
by active attempts
to destroy infrastructure facilities

High-profile attack
targets include
nuclear facilities in Iran and India
and Israel's water supply system

— Intelligence agencies are attacking
more aggressively. Their goal is now
not only to spy on targets covertly
but also destroy critical infrastructure facilities.
— During the reporting period, seven
new APT groups were identified.
Group-IB also identified six known
threat groups that had remained
unnoticed for many years.
— As part of an APT operation, adversaries shut down power units
at nuclear power plants and physically destroyed the surrounding
infrastructure.
— A major cyberattack on a water
management facility was thwarted.

During the incident, threat actors
attempted to poison water by altering water chlorine levels. Had it been
successful, the civilian population
in the country would have been seriously affected.
— Some country leaders began openly
announcing successful attacks
on other countries.
— Hacker arsenals were actively
replenished with tools designed for
attacks on air-gapped networks. Over
the past year, four tools using USB
for bridging the air gap have been
identified.

those related to nuclear energy.
— Security vendors have begun developing features for detecting backdoors at the UEFI level more actively.
Such tools will help detect new UEFI
malware leveraged during military
operations.

— New achievements made by Elon
Musk's companies in the space
industry may attract the attention
of special services, both for espionage purposes and in order to gain
control over the control systems
of his satellite internet constellation.

Forecasts
— Against the backdrop of rising
tension in the Middle East, attacks
on the control systems of transport
ships in the Persian Gulf may be carried out.
— Group-IB expects more sabotage
operations against Iran's critical
infrastructure facilities, especially

HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2020/2021

→ Key findings and Forecasts

Threats to the telecommunications sector
Current threats
State-sponsored groups
show an interest in the telecom sector and
conduct sophisticated attacks against it

2.3 Tb per second
and 809 million packets
per second
new records in DDoS attack power

— During the reporting period, six
groups linked to special services
actively attacked the telecommunications sector.
— China is expanding its capacities
in spying on mobile operators. To this
end, it has developed a special Trojan
for Linux servers that intercepts SMS
messages based on specific criteria.
— Threat actors have set new records
in DDoS attack power: 2.3 Tb per
second and 809 million packets per
second.

— 5G networks have not been widely
deployed yet, which explains why the
predictions relating to associated
threats that we made in our previous
report have not come true. They are
relevant for the next period, however.
— BGP hijacking and route leaks remain
a serious problem. Over the past
year, nine significant cases have
been publicized.

— The COVID-19 pandemic has forced
a significant number of people
to work from home, and many
of them will become permanent
work-from-home employees after
the pandemic ends. As such, the
number of attacks on home routers

and storage systems will continue to increase given that they
help advanced crime groups and
state-sponsored actors access
corporate data without infiltrating
an organization's perimeter.

Forecasts
— As interstate conflicts continue
to escalate, it is expected that threat
actors will attack telecom operators
for the first time in order to cause
logical network congestion, which
would lead to a cascading effect and
affect multiple industries.

Threats to the energy sector
Current threats
Both state-sponsored groups
and organized crime actors
disrupt facilities and encrypt data
in order to demand ransoms

Air gap bypassed:
new tools for attacks on isolated
networks discovered

— Adversary arsenals were actively
replenished with tools designed for
attacks on air-gapped networks.
Over the past year, four tools using
USB flash drives to bridge the air gap
have been identified.
— Nuclear power has become an obvious target for attackers. No such
attacks were reported in the past

year. In the reporting period, however, Iran's nuclear energy facilities
were sabotaged, while facilities
in India were subject to espionage
attacks. Threat actors are particularly
interested in India because the country is developing nuclear technology
and thorium-based reactors.
— No new frameworks able to influence
technological processes were identified in the reporting period, which
suggests that threat actors have
become more careful about concealing their use of such tools.
— Organized crime groups have begun
showing an active interest in energy
companies. Targeted attacks are carried out to seize control over entire
networks and infect infrastructure
with ransomware.

— During the reported period, nine
groups linked to intelligence services
attacked the energy sector. Seven
hackers reportedly sold access
to energy networks. In addition,
eleven successful attacks involving
ransomware were conducted on the
sector in question.
— Many types of ransomware have
been equipped with new capabilities
to detect processes associated with
industrial control systems, which has
led to substantial losses of critical
data and increased ransom amounts
for recovering access to such data.
This is especially true for data stored
on Historian servers.

last-mile energy distributors and
small suppliers that offer additional
services to energy corporations.
— 5G networks will connect a large
number of devices to global networks, including those belonging
to energy and industrial enterprises.
As a result, the attack surface will
increase dramatically.

— Cybercriminals (mainly sophisticated
hackers) will use the vector of initial
infection through vulnerable network
equipment more often. Less skilled
criminals will use common phishing
techniques.

Forecasts
— Espionage will remain the primary
goal of state-sponsored threat
actors.
— Sabotage attacks on the energy sector will be carried out in the Middle
East or in countries with emerging
military conflicts.
— To conduct attacks more effectively,
threat actors will target not only
large energy companies but also

Threats to the banking sector
Current threats
Targeted thefts are
becoming rare cases
relevant only for poorly protected banks

Hackers gaining access
and encrypting data
to obtain hefty ransoms
is a trend in the banking sector

— In 2020, there have so far been
no public reports on thefts through
SWIFT, ATM Switch, payment
gateways or ATMs when they were
accessed through a bank’s network.
— Nevertheless, the hacker group
Lazarus reportedly continued
to carry out theft attempts through
SWIFT. To gain initial access, the

hackers used a banking botnet called
Trickbot controlled by Russianspeaking cybercriminals. Moreover,
Group-IB researchers detected
activity by another threat group
that used publicly available Trojans,
keyloggers, and unmodified exploits.
Such toolsets are effective only
against banks with a minimum level
of security. Alternatively, during incident response, security teams may
have made mistakes that prevented
them from identifying more sophisticated tools.
— In the second half of 2019, only the
group Silence carried out successful
thefts without using SWIFT. They
stopped attacking the financial sector in 2020, however.
— The Philippine government-controlled United Coconut Planters Bank
(UCPB) was robbed in September

2020. The threat actors gained
access to the card processing system and changed withdrawal limits.
They also gained access to InstaPay,
an interbank transfer system.
As a result, they siphoned 167 million
pesos (USD 3.44 million) from the
bank.
— Tools used for attacks on ATMs have
evolved slightly. During the reporting
period, the following utilities were
identified: ATMDtrack developed
by Lazarus and a new version of the
ATM Trojan developed by Silence.
It has not been confirmed whether
either utility has been successfully
used in thefts.
— Cobalt and Silence have presumably
joined ransomware affiliate programs, but they have shifted their
focus from banks.

— However, stealing information about
financial transactions of VIP clients
and publishing it online may become
a more serious threat than data
encryption. Such attacks may cause
significant financial damage and
make banks pay ransoms to threat
actors more readily.
— Disclosing financial transaction data
could launch a series of investigative journalism cases similar
to the Panama Papers case in 2015
(a massive exposure of confidential

financial files belonging to Mossack
Fonseca, a Panamanian law firm),
in which some intelligence agencies
are likely to be interested.
— Another trend may be threat actors
threatening to send (fake) alerts
to financial regulators notifying
that a bank has security issues.
Threatening to send such notifications may act as an incentive
for banks to pay higher amounts
to extortionists.

Forecasts
— Next year, there will probably
be no traditional attacks on banks for
theft purposes. There may be rare
incidents, but this type of activity
will no longer be as widespread
as it used to be.
— As with other sectors, ransomware
operators will pose the biggest
threat to the financial vertical. This
hypothesis is confirmed by the
increasing number of offers selling access to corporate networks
belonging to financial institutions.

Threats to retail
Current threats
96 JS sniffer families
are currently being tracked
by Group-IB experts

156% more bank card dumps
stolen using POS Trojans were offered
for sale compared to the previous period

— It is possible to single out four main
threats targeting retailers that may
damage businesses: JS sniffers,
attacks on POS terminals, credential
stuffing, and ransomware.
— The number of known JS sniffer families has grown from 38 to 96 compared to the previous year.
— The state-sponsored threat
group Lazarus has started using

JS sniffers. The threat actor uses
a JS sniffer variant that automatically steals funds from Bitcoin
wallets.
— Techniques that prevent JS sniffers from being detected on web
resources have improved greatly.
— The carding market has doubled
from $880 million to $1.9 billion compared to the previous year.
— During the reporting period, 14 POS
Trojans were found to be active. They
were used to compromise and sell
63.7 million bank card dumps, which
is 156% more than in the previous
year.
— The amount of bank card textual
details offered for sale has increased
from 12.5 million to 28.3 million. The
largest bank card data leaks are due
to US retailers being compromised.

— During the reporting period, 19 compromised retailer networks were
identified, compared to 17 in the
previous year.
— Scammers primarily targeted bank
cards issued in the United States,
which accounts for more than 92%
of all card dumps, followed by India
and South Korea.
— Although many vendors offer solutions for protecting against bots and
attacks such as credential stuffing,
threat actors continue to actively
use bots without browsers, which
offers opportunities to create
more advanced tools for bypassing
defenses as well as possibilities
to develop the cybercrime market
in this direction.

— Attacks on computers with connected POS terminals aimed at collecting bank card dumps will remain
a major threat in the United States.
— Scammers often use a fraudulent scheme as part of which they
perform financial transactions
in a given location, then use access
to POS terminals to cancel the
operations in other countries. The
actions restore the card balance,
and the cybercriminals can continue to perform fraudulent financial
transactions. We may see similar
new schemes involving access
to online resources that accept card
payments.

— The carding market keeps growing.
However, arrests of main players
may stop this growth and redistribute carding activity between
criminals.
— The main schemes for obtaining
bank cards and the list of popular target countries are unlikely
to change.
— Carders may become more active
in Latin America, where there
is a large community of hackers with
experience in using financial Trojans.

Forecasts
— Many online resources are hacked
every day. Currently, the main monetization methods used by hackers
are selling databases and hosting
phishing pages. However, damage
to businesses may increase drastically, and along with it the profits
made by cybercriminals if the latter
begin actively cooperating with ransomware developers.
— Hacker groups using JS sniffers will
pose a major threat to online retailers, especially in the US. At the same
time, the main business risks will
be associated with fines for security
violations rather than with compensation for damage to customers
or reputational losses.

— Latin America, particularly Brazil,
has become the main source of new
banking Trojans.
— Russian-speaking owners of the
largest banking botnets (Trickbot,
Dridex, Qbot, and Silent Night) have
been following the main trend and
switching to ransomware.

— A total of 19 PC banking Trojans were
active this year, 12 of which were
written by Russian-speaking developers. Six Trojans were developed
by Latin American authors. One tool

which will also reduce this threat
significantly.
— Every year, three to five banking
botnets for PCs disappear from the
market. At this rate, the market for
PC banking Trojans may become

nonexistent in three to five years.
A similar situation may occur with
the market for Android Trojans, which
are becoming less and less effective
year after year.

Forecasts
— Russian-speaking owners of banking
botnets for both PCs and Android
devices will reduce their activity even
further. Eventually, such botnets will
cease to exist.

Web phishing and social engineering
Current threats
A 118% growth
in phishing compared to the previous year

New trend:
using one-time links
to phishing websites

— Over the period investigated, 118%
more phishing resources were
identified and taken down compared
to the previous reporting period.
— The COVID-19 pandemic has
encouraged more cybercriminals

to become involved in phishing
attacks, which is one of the key reasons for the above-mentioned rise.
— Phishing attacks targeting bookmakers increased in Q2 2020, amounting
to 6% versus 2% in the previous
quarter.
— Another attack type that increased
by 9% was phishing used to collect
accounts for various online services
such as Microsoft, Netflix, Amazon,
eBay, and Valve Steam.
— Phishing resources targeting cryptocurrency projects have disappeared
almost completely.

— So far, the main trend in 2020 is the
use of one-time unique links that
become inactive after the user
opens them. This approach helps
cybercriminals keep web phishing
resources from being detected.
— In Russia, the main reason for
the significantly higher numbers
of phishing attacks is the emergence of various affiliate programs
for hackers wanting to make money
off phishing related to fake bank
rewards programs, lottery draws,
paid surveys, etc.
— Phishing-as-a-Service projects have
become widespread in Russia.

— Phishing attacks have become
automated and longer-lasting thanks
to the emergence of scams propagated through the Phishing-as-aService model. We expect that such
projects will be actively developed
and distributed.

— One of the greatest challenges
for the cybersecurity industry will
be hackers using one-time web
phishing links.

Forecasts
— Phishing affiliate programs that have
become more popular in Russia
will be more actively used in other
regions.

Gaining access to corporate networks
for ransomware purposes
The emergence of ransomware affiliate programs
Going into 2019, many ransomware
operators shifted their focus from ordinary users to companies, government
agencies, and other victims that would
help them pocket more money. Yet
ransomware developers often lacked
the tools and capabilities to infiltrate
corporate networks. As a way to get
around this problem, they began setting
up affiliate programs. The scheme works
as follows: threat actors who specialize

in penetrating corporate networks
monetize their actions by distributing
ransomware. After the victim pays the
ransom, the ransomware authors send
a cut to their affiliates.

forums. Private affiliate programs,
on the other hand, are not advertised
and are intended to bring together
other types of threat actors (e.g. APT
groups) and trusted users.

There are two types of affiliate programs: public and private. Public programs first emerged in mid-2019. Their
distinctive feature is that the developers look for affiliates on underground

The table below contains information
on affiliate programs related to the

Many affiliates prefer to keep their
activities under the radar. However, analyzing their activity in the hacker community and information obtained during

incident response procedures has made
it possible to identify some of them.
Some users who showed an interest
in affiliate programs on underground

forums were involved in either selling
access or working with various malware
(including stealers). Examples of access

Access to a local network of an Indian financial institution
Posted October 21, 2019
I'm selling access to the local network of an Indian financial
institution. This is a mutual investment fund that belongs to
a large group of companies. I will sell this access to a single
customer and agree to work through an escrow service. I will
provide all the proof required. All details will be provided in
jabber (+OTP). Please share your contact details via PM.
Please ban my account as I want
to leave the forum.

Initial compromise vectors
Most often, the initial intrusion vector was a malicious email campaign,
a brute-force attack against Remote
Desktop Protocol (RDP), or the exploitation of public-facing applications
(including VPN-related).

Ransomware

Phishing

In addition, other methods of distributing ransomware included exploit kits,
VPNs, botnets, and other malware (e.g.,
downloaders). Supply-chain attacks
are extremely rare (the case of REvil).
In general, the above delivery methods
are also relevant for ransomware distributed without affiliate programs.

Post-compromise
Once inside, many ransomware operators first attempt to escalate privileges
by using exploits or post-exploitation
frameworks. They then gain access
to other accounts using various software (e.g., Mimikatz, LaZagne) or bruteforce attacks.

Cobalt Strike

Threat actors then perform network
reconnaissance using legitimate

as Cobalt Strike and Metasploit. They

Stealing and publishing data
In the early days, cybercriminals only
encrypted data and demanded ransoms
from victims. Since the end of 2019,
however, many have started using a new
technique: before encrypting all the
information, they copy it to their servers
for further blackmailing. They usually
Figure 3. Stolen data goes online

use the HTTP, HTTPS, and FTPprotocols
and legitimate cloud storage services.
On rare occasions, they use email and
instant messengers.
In such cases, if the victim fails to pay
the ransom, then in addition to the data

being stolen, the ransomware operators
will publish them online. To do so they
create special websites, usually in the
Tor network. An example of such a website is shown below.

Figure 4. REvil auction

Attack statistics
Ransomware victims include both
small local companies and international giants. Over the last year, there
have been reports of more than 500
successful attacks using well-known
ransomware on companies in more
than 45 countries. The total number

group-ib.com

of successful attacks is much higher,
but either the companies affected
decided not to publicize the incident
and pay the ransomware or the attack
did not involve publishing data stolen
from the victim's network.

The most popular targets (about 60%)
were US companies. European countries accounted for only about 20%
of all attacks. About 10% were countries
in North and South America (excluding
the USA) and Asia (7%).

HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2020/2021

Maze and REvil have been the
most active ransomware since
late 2019, accounting for over
50% of successful attacks.
Ryuk, NetWalker, DoppelPaymer
are in the second tier.
The most often attacked
sector was manufacturing.
Half of all attacks targeted
entities in the manufacturing,
trade, government, healthcare,
construction, and academic
sectors. Although they currently
focus on the above industries,
affiliates usually seek easier
targets, which explains the wide
distribution of attacks across
different verticals.

Estimated damage
Unfortunately, it is difficult to establish
the exact damage caused by ransomware groups. This is because the
amount should include the ransoms
paid by victims, losses caused by system downtime, and expenses of recovering internal systems. In addition,
it is difficult to obtain information about
all attacks because many companies
pay ransoms without making this fact
public.

The table below details past ransom amounts

What’s more, the amount often varies
from company to company:
— For example, the ransoms demanded
by the group REvil depend on the
size of the company and the number
of infected hosts. If only one computer on the network is infected, the
ransom amount is about $48,000;
but if several machines within the
company's network are infected,
then the average ransom amount
is $470,000. There were several
cases when the amount exceeded
$1,000,000. The average ransom
amounts to $260,000.

— A group called Maze usually
demands extremely high ransoms,
i.e. beyond one million dollars. The
average ransom is $2,420,000.
— Some groups such as WastedLocker
carried out very few attacks, but
the ransom amount exceeded
$10 million.
— The same applies to MegaCortex
ransomware. The exact number
of attacks it has been involved
in is unknown, but the ransoms
reportedly vary from 20,000
to $5,800,000.

This means that if combined publicly
known attacks and experts estimations
of possible ransomware incidents, the
total potential damage could exceed
one billion dollars ($1,005,186,000).
The data above only covers known incidents and shows the lower end of the
damage. It is just the tip of the iceberg.
For example, only 62 incidents involving Ryuk and spread using the banking
Trojan Trickbot have been reported.

According to Group-IB's statistics, however, the owners of the Trickbot botnet
have successfully encrypted more than
2,500 different networks over the past
year using ransomware such as Ryuk
(later Conti), Kraken, and Thanos. This
means that the 62 known incidents represent only 2.5 percent of all incidents.
The actual damage is likely to be much
greater.

As regards Dharma ransomware, its
source code was put up for sale last
year and could have been used by many
groups. Given the circumstances,
it is difficult to establish the damage
caused.

Increasingly larger market for selling
access to corporate networks
Sales of credentials are widespread
on underground forums and have taken
place since the early days of such communities. For a long time, cybercriminals
did not perform additional reconnaissance after finding servers and gaining
access to them, nor did they understand that the compromised servers

could belong to large companies and
that access to them could be capitalized on.

2018

2019

Sales of corporate network access are
increasing from year to year. The peak
of sales occurred in 2020, which is associated with an increase in the number

of new ransomware affiliate programs.
Between H2 2019 and H1 2020, the number of access for sale offers increased
2.6-fold (from 138 to 362) compared
to the previous period.

Nation-state actors sell access to networks
and use ransomware
In an effort to increase their profits,
some state-sponsored groups began
selling access to corporate networks
or even using ransomware like regular
cybercriminals.

A perfect example is an ad published
by a user with the nickname nanash
in June 2020. The seller offered access
to many networks, including some
belonging to US government departments, defense contractors (Airbus,

Although the message looks suspicious, further investigation revealed
that its author had access to at least
two companies from the list above.
Group-IB experts obtained screenshots
and a video demonstration of LDAP
access as evidence.

— Taiwanese authorities suspect
that Chinese hackers from APT41
were behind a ransomware attack
on Taiwan's energy and technology
companies in May 2020. The notice
included CPC Corp., a Taiwanese
company that delivers petroleum
products throughout the island,
among the victims. While the attack
did not affect CPC's manufacturing
processes, it prevented customers
from using CPC Corp.'s payment
cards to buy gas. During the wave
of attacks on Taiwanese targets,
threat actors used a new ransomware called ColdLock. Malware
analysis revealed similarities
between the program and two known
ransomware families: Freezing and
EDA2, an open-source ransomware
originally created for educational
purposes.

In the ad, the seller specifies that
the price of access to each company
is 11 BTC (USD 125,000). Access is sold
directly with partial prepayment: after
the customer has transferred 5 BTC, the
seller provides additional evidence and
the second transaction occurs.
In the message, the author did not
mention all the companies they have
access to, but the cost of accesses
to companies listed explicitly is close
to $5 million.
Another way for state-sponsored
groups to make money is to use
ransomware:

— The hacker group Lazarus has
resumed developing ransomware.
The fact was brought to light during
attacks on European companies
involving ransomware called VHD
Ransomware. The hackers gained
access through a vulnerable VPN
gateway, obtained administrator
privileges, and installed the Dacls
backdoor. They moved across the
victim's network and encrypted
files with a combination of AES-256
in ECB mode and RSA-2048.
— Another group of Chinese hackers,
IronTiger, was behind the attack
involving HybirdRansom ransomware
against companies in the AsiaPacific region in the fall of 2019 and
the spring of 2020. The ransomware
has three components that consequently launch each other to lock
the machine and encrypt file: Locker,
Loader, and Cryptor.

Compromised hosts by time (2019-2020)

Large companies under increasing threat from massive hacks
In the past, massive attacks did not
cause serious damage to large companies. This was because brute-force
attacks or exploiting vulnerabilities
in widespread software led to their
infrastructure being used to distribute
or manage malicious code, mine cryptocurrencies, conduct DDoS attacks,
or proxy traffic.
However, the market for the sale
of access to corporate networks, the
number of ransomware attacks, and APT
group activity have all increased, so the
cost of an error on a company’s external
perimeter has surged as well.
Ten out of 15 ransomware affiliate
programs focus on brute-force attacks
on RDP. Three programs actively exploit

vulnerabilities in VPN services.
APT groups performed similar actions.
For example, APT29 (aka Cozy Bear)
actively exploited the following vulnerabilities with public exploits:
— CVE-2019-19781 (Citrix)
— CVE-2019-11510 (Pulse Secure)
— CVE-2018-13379 (FortiGate)
— CVE-2019-9670 (Zimbra)
The APT group BlackEnergy (aka
Sandworm) exploited CVE-2019-10149
(a vulnerability in the Exim mail server)
to install an SSH backdoor.
Ordinary criminal groups carried
out similar actions. For example, the
group Clownz responsible for leaks

from GoDaddy and 247.ai also used
CVE‑2019-10149 (Exim) to install an SSH
backdoor. For several months of activity,
the group infected 80,000 servers.
As mentioned above, one of the main
ways to gain access to corporate networks is to conduct brute-force attacks
on remote access interfaces (RDP, SSH,
VPN). How effective such an attack
is will determine how many companies
will be compromised as a result and how
much money the fraudsters will make.
Another key change is the emergence
of new types of botnets. Their main
purpose is to help perform distributed
brute-force attacks from a large number
of infected devices, including servers.

Hey friends,
After one year of work, I'm happy to present a distributed
brute-force scanner.
The distributed scanner/ bruteforcer is a software that
distributes tasks to several computers to scan/brute-force
simultaneously. This speeds up the process significantly.
Can the solutions be used on computers found?
Yes, when using a module rootkit.

Inside the encrypted communications within the HTTP POST requests,
Group-IB researchers found the
malware version 1.0.1. Such a version number indicates an early stage

of development. Other fields suggest
the existence of plans for non-C++

measures much more effective, and
means that more and more attacks can
be tracked. Most such groups have their

Golden Falcon
An unexpected discovery in 2019 was
the activity of the group Golden Falcon
(aka APT-C-34), which became known
after one of the group's C&C servers
was detected.
The group hacked private companies and government organizations
in Kazakhstan. They mainly used two
tools. The first was a version of RCS
(Remote Control System), a surveillance kit sold by an Italian vendor called
HackingTeam. The second was a backdoor named Harpoon that appears

to have been developed by the group
itself. Documentation about the latter
in Russian was found on a C&C server,
which suggests that the group hired
third-party developers to write the
malware according to the group's own
technical specifications.
The group's activities resemble those
of the group DustSquad, which has
been active since 2017. They also
orchestrate espionage campaigns
in Kazakhstan, for which they used
the Octopus Trojan. The group may

in monitoring the situation in the
country.
Naikon
The prize for the most stealthy and
long-term campaign goes to the
Chinese group Naikon for its five-year
campaign against top government
agencies in target countries in the
APAC region. Naikon used a new backdoor called Aria-body that creates
and deletes files and directories, takes
screenshots, searches for files, and
collects data (file metadata, system
information, and location data). Even
though the threat actor uses common
initial intrusion vectors (emails with
malicious attachments), their attacks
are highly effective.
APT20
For two years, the group APT20
remained undetected while attacking
companies and government agencies.
The threat actor stole passwords and
bypassed two-factor authentication
to collect target data. Their large-scale
campaign called Operation Wocao
affected multiple industries including
aviation, construction, finance, healthcare, insurance, gambling, and energy.

APT30

The criminals effectively covered their
tracks by regularly removing data-stealing tools from infected computers.
APT5
Another surprise comeback came from
the group APT5 (aka Manganese). The
group has been active since 2007 and
consists of several subgroups with
specific tactics and infrastructure. The
criminals infiltrate organizations across
various verticals. Their primary interest
appears to be telecommunications and
technology organizations, with a particular affinity for satellite communication firms.
During the reporting period, APT5 created an infrastructure designed to scan

It was uncovered that the group APT30
has been upkeeping its 10-year-old
tools (BACKSPACE and NETEAGLE) and
has used them in attacks on Southeast
Asia. In addition, the hackers continued
with their old approaches to organizing
network resources and tested new software: RHttpCtrl and RCtrl.
Cycldek
The hacker group Cycldek also made
an appearance. The threat actor
uses the USBCulprit Trojan, which
is designed to steal data from corporate networks and helps gain access
to disconnected and physically isolated
devices. The malware had gone undetected since 2014, with new samples
appearing in 2019. The group focused
on government organizations in several
countries in Southeast Asia.

Attacks on nuclear facilities
India, 2019
In September 2019, Group-IB experts
discovered an archive containing
Dtrack, a remote administration tool
attributed to the North Korean group
Lazarus. Analysis revealed that the logs
contained data from a compromised
machine running Windows that belonged
to an employee of the Nuclear Power
Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL).
All the files in the archive were compiled
at different times, but the main file with
the compromised data is dated January
30, 2019, i.e. more than six months before
they were detected. This suggests that
the hackers remained unnoticed in the
victim’s network for a long time.
Analysis revealed that the attack against
NPCIL was taken even further and led
to Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant (situated in the south of the state of Tamil
Nadu) being compromised. On October
19, 2019, the power plant’s second power
unit was shut down. Group-IB believes
that these events may be linked.
According to the company officials, the
reason for the power unit being shut
down was a low SG level:
“The most important SG parameter
subjected to regulation is the SG level.
If the level is too low, the insufficient
heat removal by the secondary side may

group-ib.com

cause evaporation of the reactor coolant,
thus overheating of the reactor core.”
In other words, the pressure in the
steam generator, which is responsible
for transferring heat from the core to the
generator's turbine, was low. This could
have led to the core overheating.
After cybersecurity expert Puhraj Singh
tweeted about the attack, the nuclear
power plant's administration released
a statement in which Singh's words were
called “false information” and denied that
an attack had occurred, stating that “any
cyber-attack on the Nuclear Power Plant
Control System is not possible.”
The Nuclear Power Corporation of India
Limited, however, later confirmed that
the plant had been attacked. NPCIL’s official statement said that the malware
infected one computer connected to the
nuclear power plant’s administrative network, but did not reach its critical internal
network used to control the power
plant's nuclear reactors.
South Korea, 2020
In April 2020, Lazarus sent malicious
emails to a company in the energy sector
in South Korea. The hackers disguised
themselves using a document with
a description of a vacancy at KHNP
(Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co., Ltd.).

KHNP is a subsidiary of Korea Electric
Power Corporation. It operates large
nuclear and hydroelectric plants in South
Korea, which supply about 30% of the
country's electric power.
In addition, since October 2019, the North
Korean groups Lazarus and Kimsuky
have been actively attacking South
Korea's defense enterprises. The attacks
have intensified since April 2020.
Iran, 2020
On July 3, 2020, it transpired that the
Israeli authorities were suspected of carrying out a cyberattack on Iran's nuclear
facilities. The incident occurred on July
2 at Iran's largest uranium-enrichment
facility in Natanz and caused a fire
and explosion. Before the incident was
made public, a group calling itself the
Homeland Cheetahs sent a statement
to BBC Persian journalists and claimed
to be behind the attack. The group allegedly consists of "former members of the
Iranian security forces who have decided
to fight against the authorities."
Iran's officials said the incident had
caused significant damage that could
slow the development of advanced
uranium enrichment centrifuges, but that
there had been no casualties.

Attacks on Israel's water supply facilities
In April 2020, the Israeli National CyberDirectorate (INCD) issued a security
alert urging staff at companies in the
energy and water sectors to change
passwords for all Internet-connected
systems. According to the alert, the
agency had received reports of intrusion attempts at wastewater treatment
plants, water pumping stations, and
sewers, which was confirmed by the
Israeli authorities. Details of the attacks
were not disclosed, but INCD Head Yigal
Unn said they could have led to some
damage to the civilian population and
even temporary water shortages. Israeli
officials said that the attacks had

targeted SCADA systems of wastewater
treatment facilities, but that they had
been successfully thwarted.
Initial reports played down the April
attack, but a Financial Times report
a few month later cited its sources
as claiming that the hackers had gained
access to some of Israel's water treatment systems and tried altering water
chlorine levels before being detected
and stopped. If the sabotage attack had
been successful, attackers could have
poisoned the local population served
by the treatment facility affected.
In addition, the Israeli Water Authority
warned that in June 2020 water

supply and water treatment systems
were attacked again. The incidents
reportedly did not cause any damage
to Israel’s water system.
The first attack affected agricultural
water pumps in upper Galilee, while
the second one targeted water pumps
in the central province of Mateh Yehuda,
local media reported.
"These were specific, small drainage
installations in the agriculture sector that were immediately and independently repaired by the locals, causing no harm or any real-world effects,"
the Water Authority said in a statement.

Attacks on Iran’s critical facilities
On May 9, 2020, hackers carried
out a cyberattack on the systems of Iran’s Shahid Rajaee port
in the city of Bandar Abbas. According
to Iran's Ministry of Roads and Urban
Development officials, the attack
affected a limited number of private
operating resources in the port and did
not cause significant damage.

It was later revealed, however, that computers regulating the flow of vessels,
trucks, and goods all crashed at the
same time, creating massive backups
on waterways and roads leading to the
facility.
The attack was presumably in response
to an alleged Iranian attempt to hack
into Israel’s water infrastructure
systems.

The attack was followed by a series
of accidents and explosions at some
of Iran’s critical facilities, including petrochemical plants, uranium enrichment
facilities, power plants, and ports.

out a number of attacks recently.
In February 2020, the hackers successfully exploited a Cisco RV320 router
at a telecommunications organization.
It is unknown what specific exploit was
used, but there is a Metasploit module
that combines CVE-2019-1653 and
CVE-2019-1652 to enable remote code
execution on such routers. It also uses
wget to download specified payloads.
APT41 also exploited the CVE2020-10189 vulnerability in Zoho
ManageEngine, which allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code with SYSTEM/root privileges. The day after CVE-2020-10189
was fixed, the threat actors attacked
over a dozen systems and compromised
at least five. They then deployed a trial
version of the Cobalt Strike BEACON
loader and used another backdoor
to download VMProtected Meterpreter.

OilRig
The Iranian group OilRig has been
directly involved in two campaigns
affecting the telecommunications
sector.
One of the campaigns lasted three
years and was dubbed Fox Kitten
by security researchers. During the
campaign, the threat actors gained
access to and ensured persistence
in the networks belonging to numerous companies and organizations
from various sectors, including
telecommunications.
In most cases, target organizations
were initially infected through one-day
vulnerabilities in various VPN services
such as Pulse Secure VPN, Fortinet
VPN, and Palo Alto Networks’ Global
Protect. Once inside the company,
the attackers would try to maintain
access to networks by opening a variety
of communication tools, including opening RDP links over SSH tunneling. At the
final stage, after successfully infiltrating

The second campaign affected telecom
providers in South Asia and was discovered in April 2020. During the campaign,
the threat actors used post-exploitation
frameworks and tools such as Covenant,
Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, and Mimikatz.
In addition, the group used legitimate tools such as Plink, Bitvise, and
Bitsadmin. The threat actors used
phishing emails to gain initial access.
The campaign’s main aim was to steal
user credentials and gain access
to database servers using the obtained
credentials.
The attacks were long-term: the
threat actors may have infiltrated the
network of one organization as early
as in October 2019. The first activity
was detected on October 11, 2019,
when a malicious PowerShell command
was executed to install a Cobalt Strike
Beacon module. The threat actors then
executed a PowerShell command that
launched Metasploit for achieving persistence in the system.
The group’s activities resumed
on February 6, 2020, when a PowerShell
command was executed to search for
files similar to web.config. For each
file found, the threat actors extracted
username and password details where
possible. They may use the credentials
to access organizational resources such
as SQL servers.
On March 11, the threat actor attempted
to connect to a database server via
PowerShell, presumably using stolen
credentials. The hackers also used
an SQL command to obtain information about the database server version, possibly to verify credentials and
connectivity.
Molerats
Between October 2019 and early
December 2019, security researchers
identified multiple instances of phishing

attacks likely related to a threat group
called Molerats (also known as Gaza
Hackers Team and Gaza Cybergang).
The group targeted organizations in the
telecommunications, insurance, and
retail industries and government agencies, eight in total, all in six countries.
All the attacks involved spear-phishing emails with malicious documents
that required the recipient to carry out
certain actions. The social engineering
techniques involved misleading images
that tricked users into enabling content
to run macros. The hackers also threatened to release compromising pictures
to the media as a way of coercing users
into clicking a link and downloading
malicious payloads. During most such
attacks, the payload was a backdoor
called Spark, which allows threat actors
to open applications and run command
line commands on the compromised
system.
Mikroceen
Security experts analyzed a Trojan
used by an unknown Chinese APT that
spied on undisclosed companies in the
telecommunications and gas industries as well as a government entity
in Central Asia. The analysts called this
campaign Mikroceen.
As part of their operations, the threat
group used backdoors to gain permanent access to corporate networks. Based on the data obtained,
Group-IB researchers believe that
the same group was involved in other
attacks, including Microcin against
Russian military personnel, BYEBY
against the Belarussian government, and Vicious Panda against the
Mongolian public sector. The group has
been active since at least 2017.
The experts justify this theory by the
fact that the hackers used Gh0st RAT,
which has been used by Chinese APTs
often and for a long time. In addition,
the analysts discovered clear similarities in the malware codes.

Attacks on mobile operators
APT41, a Chinese state-sponsored
threat group, was highly active during
the investigated period. The group
actively deployed malware called
MESSAGETAP.
The malware is designed for Linux
devices and meant to be installed
on Short Message Service Center
(SMSC) servers located inside mobile
operator networks that handle SMS
communications. After compromising
a cluster of Linux servers belonging
to an unidentified telecom provider,
the group would intercept messages

group-ib.com

sent by individuals of interest to the
Chinese government. The criminals then
searched for messages based on the
keyword list containing items of geopolitical interest for Chinese intelligence
services. Sanitized examples include the
names of political leaders, military and
intelligence organizations, and political
movements at odds with the Chinese
government.
MESSAGETAP also sets aside SMS
messages if they are sent from
or to particular phone numbers,
or from or to a device with a particular

International Mobile Subscriber Identity
(IMSI) unique identifier. When it was
discovered, the malware was tracking
thousands of device phone numbers
and IMSI codes at a time.
During attacks, the threat actor also
interacted with call detail record (CDR)
databases to query, save, and steal
records about individuals of interest.
Targeting CDR information provides
a high-level overview of phone calls
between individuals, including time,
duration, and phone numbers.

HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2020/2021

→ Threats to the telecommunications sector

MESSAGETAP is a 64-bit ELF data miner
initially loaded by an installation script.
Once installed, the malware checks
for two files: keyword_parm.txt and
parm.txt, which contain instructions
for MESSAGETAP to target and save
SMS message content. Both files are
deleted from the disk once the configuration files are read and loaded into
the memory. After loading the keyword

and phone data files, MESSAGETAP
begins monitoring all network connections to and from the server. It uses
the libpcap library to listen to all traffic
and extracts SMS message metadata,
including SMS message content, IMSI
numbers, and source and destination
phone numbers.

Based on the above information, users
and organizations must consider
the risk of unencrypted data being
intercepted several layers upstream
in their cellular communication chain.
This is especially critical for frequently
targeted individuals such as dissidents,
journalists, and officials who handle
highly sensitive information.

BGP Hijacking
BGP hijacking remains a serious problem. Attacks and deliberate interruptions often occur because companies fail to correctly set configurations or prefix filters.

Growing power of DDoS attacks
An increase in the number of Internet
of Things (IoT) devices has led to more
and more hosts being added to infamous botnets such as Mirai. In addition,
new botnets have emerged.
As regards DDoS attack techniques,
SYN floods still remain the most
common type of attack. ICMP flood
attacks rose from last to second place
in popularity, and HTTP floods finished
in last place — they have become less
widespread since January 2019.
In 2020, denial-of-service attacks
became more effective. In the first half
of 2020, threat actors set new records
for DDoS attack power.

group-ib.com

Largest Gbps DDoS attack ever
recorded
According to Amazon's Q1 2020 threat
report, its AWS Shield service mitigated the largest DDoS attack ever
recorded, stopping a 2.3 Tbps attack
in mid-February this year. The company
did not disclose the attack’s target
or origin. The attack was carried out
using hijacked CLDAP web servers and
lasted three days. CLDAP (Connectionless Lightweight Directory Access
Protocol) is an alternative to the older
LDAP protocol that has been abused for
DDoS attacks since 2016. CLDAP servers are known to amplify DDoS traffic

by 56 to 70 times its initial size, making
it a highly sought-after protocol and
a common option provided by DDoSfor-hire services.
The previous record for the largest DDoS attack ever recorded was
1.7 Tbps. It was mitigated by NETSCOUT
Arbor in March 2018. The attack
abused Memcached servers exposed
to the Internet and reached massive
bandwidths.

Largest Mpps DDoS attack
A bank in Europe was hit by a massive,
distributed denial-of-service (ddos)
attack that generated a record 809
million packets per second (PPs). The
record ddos attack was mitigated
by Akamai on June 21, 2020. The company did not disclose the bank’s name.
it was unusual that 96.2% of the
iP addresses involved in the attacks
were not being tracked as recent
attacks, which suggests that a new

botnet emerged. The June 21 attack was
remarkable not only for its size, but also
because of how quickly it reached its
peak. The attack grew from normal traffic levels to 418 Gbps in seconds before
reaching its peak size of 809 Mpps
in approximately two minutes. in total,
the attack lasted just under 10 minutes.
Nation-level accessibility issues
in early February 2020, iran's infrastructure came under a large-scale ddos

attack, which left 25% of users in iran
without internet. The NetBlocks internet
observatory, which maps internet security and freedom in real-time, confirmed
that there was extensive disruption
to the iranian telecommunications
network that began on the morning
of February 8 at 11:45 local time.
The consequences of the massive ddos
attack left the country’s major network
operators unable to operate for one
to seven hours.

to the "Military Operations" section
of this report. As part of their operations, adversaries shut down power
units at nuclear power plants and
physically destroyed the surrounding
infrastructure.
in the reporting period, iran's nuclear
energy facilities were sabotaged, while
facilities in india were subject to espionage attacks. Threat actors are particularly interested in india because the
country is developing nuclear technology and thorium-based reactors.
Apart from special services, organized
crime groups also began to pose a serious threat to energy companies. Both
can disrupt production using ransomware to obtain a ransom.

attack. During the summer of 2019, the
attackers used a password spray from
a system on the local network to gain
access to additional accounts, install
ASPX web shells, and gain domain
administration privileges.

It also terminates the Outlook process and checks the Windows version
running on the system. If the system
is running Windows 10, the ransomware
carries out several Windows 10-specific
routines. Windows Defender is disabled, as is the ability to send feedback/
malware samples to Microsoft. Push
notifications are disabled as well.

After the device was compromised
through a vulnerable driver, the wiper
spread to other devices in the network
for further destructive attacks. The
malware then overwrote the master
boot record (MBR) and disk partitions
on Windows-based machines using
a legitimate driver, EldoS RawDisk. While
Group-IB researchers could not determine the exact number of organizations
that were impacted, at least 1,400 hosts
were affected by ZeroCleare.

The Chinese-backed hacker group
APT20 attacked companies in ten
countries as part of a campaign called
Operation Wocao. The group’s attacks
affected various industries, including
the energy sector.
The hackers compromised target
networks via vulnerable web servers
managed by a company or government
entity. The threat actor then propagated
across the network looking for system
administrator credentials with privileged
access to the infrastructure's most
critical parts.
APT20 installed keyloggers on computers used by administrators in order
to capture keystrokes and steal passwords. The campaign involved tools
such as web shells for file upload and
command execution, a script for scanning the system for information, the
custom XServer backdoor, CheckAdmin
to identify if administrators are logged
in, and others.
APT28
The group APT28 is believed to have
been behind a phishing attack against
the Ukrainian oil and gas group company Burisma in early November 2019.
The threat actors registered lookalike
domains that mimicked legitimate websites belonging to Burisma’s subsidiaries and partners. In particular, domains
targeting the following subsidiaries
were discovered: KUB-Gas LLC, EskoPivnich, and CUB Energy Inc.
To carry out the attack, the threat
actors sent employees emails with
links to login pages. The links looked
legitimate. In addition, the attackers
set up sender authentication records
using SPF and DKIM. After victims
followed the link and entered their credentials, the attackers gained access
to them and could use them to further
the attack. Some employees entered
their credentials on the fake webpages, which allowed the threat actors
to stealthily operate within the organization and obtain the information they
needed.
APT41
The group APT41 used a new ransomware family called ColdLock to conduct
a series of attacks against several
organizations in Taiwan. Analysis of the
malware revealed similarities between
ColdLock and the previously known
Freezing ransomware family as well
as the EDA2 “educational” ransomware
kit. For example, Freezing and ColdLock
have a similar method of propagating within networks (compromised
AD servers), similar reflective injection
methods, and a similar internal module
architecture.
ColdLock terminates the following services on the system before encrypting
their files:
group-ib.com

According to media reports, the
campaign struck the computer systems of Taiwan’s state-owned energy
company, CPC Corp., which delivers oil
products throughout Taiwan. Although
the attack did not affect the company’s energy production, it did reportedly
prevent some customers from using
CPC Corp.’s payment cards to purchase
gas.
PoetRAT
A new remote access Trojan
named PoetRAT was discovered
in February 2020. The attacks affected
Azerbaijan’s government agencies
and industrial companies, mainly
in the energy sector. The investigation
revealed that cybercriminals are particularly interested in SCADA systems
used in the electricity sector, specifically in wind turbine systems.
RAT is written in Python and has all the
features specific to this type of malware. It gives the operators complete
control over the compromised system.
The attackers sent malicious Microsoft
Word documents, some of which were
made to look like messages from
Azerbaijani government agencies
or from the Defense Research and
Development Organization of India.
Some of the file names mentioned
COVID-19.
The threat actors monitored specific
directories, which meant that they
wanted to exfiltrate specific information about the victims. The attackers
likely wanted to get a full picture of the
victims by using keyloggers, browser
credential stealers, and Mimikatz
and pypykatz for further credential
harvesting.
OilRig
Iranian hackers were once again found
to be using wipers, but this time the
attacks are attributed to the OilRig
group (aka APT34). A new Trojan called
ZeroCleare was used in a recently
discovered targeted attack on an oil and
gas company.
The attack most likely started in the fall
of 2018 with reconnaissance scanning
from various low-cost/free VPN providers and gaining access to one of the
accounts that was later involved in the

Later, a new strain of ZeroCleare
data-wiping malware called Dustman
was detected on the network belonging
to Bapco, Bahrain's national oil company. A common component of the
malware is EldoS RawDisk. Dustman
differs from other wipers by the fact
that the necessary drivers and loaders
are supplied in one executable file and
not two, as is the case with ZeroCleare.
Dustman also overwrites the volume,
while ZeroCleare erases it by overwriting it with junk data (0x55).
In this case, however, OilRig was most
likely trying to cover its tracks as the
hackers had previously made mistakes
that revealed their presence on the
network.
Orangeworm
Since January 2020, a wave of attacks
involving the Kwampirs Trojan has been
identified. The malware has been linked
to the Orangeworm group, which used
the Trojan to attack companies in the
healthcare sector, in particular software
supply chain companies.
After penetrating the system, Kwampirs
collects basic data about the device and
sends it to a remote server. Attackers
then gain access to sensitive data using
the backdoor on the infected machine.
If the compromised system is identified as potentially interesting, the data
is stolen and the malware is copied
to all available machines and network
resources.
This year, the threat actor has been
conducting supply-chain attacks
against software vendors, but the
group's ultimate interest has changed.
They now attempt to gain access
to organizations that support industrial
control systems (ICS) for the global production, transmission, and distribution
of energy.
Orangeworm is not officially associated with any country. The FBI has said,
however, that the Kwampirs source
code shows that the Trojan is similar to the infamous Shamoon wiper
developed by the Iranian hacker APT33,
though the latter does not have a wiper
component.

Modus operandi

Cycldek (China)

USBCulprit

USBCulprit is delivered using another Trojan (NewCore RAT), which
initially reaches users via spear phishing emails, usually politically
themed.
Once it is in the system, USBCulprit scans paths to executable
files, collects documents with certain extensions, and exports them
to USB drives connected to the system.
When a USB drive infected with USBCulprit is connected
to a computer, the Trojan will copy stolen files either to or from the
removable drive.

Tropic Trooper (China)

USB worm
USBferry

The threat actors ferry a malware installer via USB into an air-gapped
host.
The malware checks for network connectivity. If it determines that the
network is unavailable, it tries to collect information from the target
machine and copy the collected data to USB storage.
After that, the Trojan exfiltrates information and uploads it to the
C&C server.

Ramsay 2.a
(early March 2020)

All versions of the malware differ from each other and infect victims
in different ways. Versions 1 and 2.b exploit a vulnerability in .doc
(CVE-2017-0199), .rtf (CVE-2017-11882), and Visual Basic mechanisms
integrated into Word. Version 2.a is disguised as a 7zip installer.
The persistence mechanism is selected based on the Ramsay version
used. Some have a special Spreader component that copies Ramsay
to all PE files located on disks, including removable drives, in order
to eventually reach isolated systems.
The threat actor exfiltrates the collected data using an external
component that has not yet been detected.

Turla

COMpfun

The hackers have updated the classic COMpfun remote access Trojan
by adding the ability to check whether a USB drive is connected
to the infected host. Security experts believe that this mechanism
is used by Turla to infect physically isolated systems and spread the
Trojan automatically.

Transparent Tribe

USBWorm component
of the Crimson Trojan

USBWorm is a component developed for stealing files from
removable drives and spreading malware across systems by infecting
removable media. To steal data, the malware enumerates all the files
stored on the device and copies those with an extension matching
a predefined list.
As part of the infection process, the malware lists all directories.
Then, for each directory, it creates a copy of itself in the drive root
directory using the same directory name and changing the directory
attribute to “hidden”.
This results in all the actual directories being hidden and replaced
with a copy of the malware using the same directory name. Moreover,
USBWorm uses an icon that mimics a Windows directory, tricking the
user into executing the malware when trying to access a directory.

HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2020/2021

→ Threats to the telecommunications sector

Analysis of these attacks reveals that threat actors usually apply the following techniques to attack the energy sector:

Attack vector

Modus operandi

Reconnaissance via OPC

Attackers use the OPC protocol to gather information about the equipment being
used and to identify its topology.

Access to SCADA HMI

Since HMI workstations have a small attack surface, in addition to standard methods of gaining access
to computers running Windows, hackers actively investigate vulnerabilities in the HMI. Exploiting such
vulnerabilities means that malicious code can be executed.

Controller management

Attack frameworks (e.g., Idustroyer) are being supplemented with modules that allow threat actors
to manage controllers using standard protocols such as IEC 60870-5-101, IEC 60870-5-104, and IEC 61850.

Control over emergency
shutdown systems

Control over emergency shutdown systems allows hackers to stop production, so attackers have
developed specialized modules for this purpose (e.g., the Triton framework).

Infiltration through home
routers and NAS

In order to detect industrial networks, the threat actors load modules for traffic analysis and Modbus
protocol detection (e.g., the VPNFilter framework) on network devices.

Organized crime targeting the energy sector
Crime groups conduct two main types
of attack on the energy sector:
— Active sale of access, including
to networks belonging to energy
companies

— Ransomware attacks
Many types of ransomware have been
equipped with new capabilities to detect
processes associated with industrial
control systems. This has caused

substantial losses of critical data and
higher ransom amounts for recovering access to such data. This is especially true for data stored on Historian
servers.

Sale of access
In 2019, cybercriminals stopped publish
full company names very often, making
it more difficult to categorize a compromised company. Based on the descriptions presented, six companies in the
energy sector were identified. Five

of them are associated with the extraction of energy resources.
In 2020, Group-IB did not observe
an increase in the sale of access to networks belonging to energy companies.
This year, access to seven companies

was offered for sale. Two companies
are involved with energy directly and
five are associated with production. The
only company whose name has been
published is Entrust Energy.

THREATS TO THE
BANKING SECTOR
Focus shifted
to ransomware
сriminals use more convenient
and profitable methods

Small and poorly
protected banks
are still being successfully attacked
for targeted theft of funds

Leaks including
transaction history
are likely to pose risks to the sector,
together with ransomware

group-ib.com

The era of targeted attacks on banks
to steal funds is over. Last year's report
covered five active groups: Cobalt,
MoneyTaker, Silence, SilentCards,
and Lazarus, all of which successfully
committed thefts through SWIFT, ATM
Switch, card processing, and ATMs.
In 2020, such thefts have almost
stopped.

HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2020/2021

→ Threats to the banking sector

Recent thefts
SWIFT
Only Lazarus and Cobalt stole via
SWIFT. The most recent public incident
occurred in February 2019 at the Bank
of Valletta in Malta.
The most interesting events always
remain behind the scenes, however,
and attempts to commit theft have not

stopped entirely. Over the past year,
Group-IB researchers detected incidents in several countries (Argentina,
India, Kenya, Ghana, and Jordan) per
quarter, but not all attempts were successful. Two groups were active during
this period: NanoSwift and Lazarus.

NanoSwift
At least one known incident involving
this group took place. Compromise
was initially achieved using a legitimate
remote access tool called RMS, which
was installed using a VBS script:

install.vbs
c719a030434d3fa96d62868f27e904a6
f2f750a752dd1fda8915a47b082af7cf2d3e3655
2696ee4302a85c6b4101fc6d1ce8e38b94fd9c2bbd1acc73b553576b3aacb92f

This script has been “in the wild” for
a long time and was first uploaded
to VirusTotal on October 8, 2018.

For further propagation, the attackers used the well-known NanoCore
Trojan, which was saved on the system
as lanss.exe in the \LAN Subsystem\
lanss.exe directory, which is a typical
NanoCore indicator known since 2018.

The following tools were used to escalate privileges:

Tool

Description

Invoke-MS16135.ps1

A privilege escalation exploit that is a part of PowerShell Empire

Invoke-MS16032.ps1
RoguePotato.zip

Tools for running programs with SYSTEM privileges

cve-2020-0796-local.zip

CoronaBlue exploit

Hooker_3.4.zip

Hooker keylogger by Den4b

rkfree_setup_2.26_password_123.exe

Revealer keylogger

Evidence suggests that the threat actor
uses quite an old toolset. It is effective
only if the hackers attack a bank with
a minimum level of security and set
“traps” for the incident response teams.

Lazarus

What is notable, however, is the use
of CVE-2020-0796, which was made
public in March 2020, and the first
exploit was made available in the same
month. A file named cve-2020-0796-local.zip was published on GitHub on April
3. This indicates that the incident took
place between April and July 2020.

Lazarus mainly attacks small banks
because they are an easy target.
In 2020, it transpired that the group
purchases pay-per-install services from
operators of the TrickBot botnet. This
explains why, in the case of several
incidents, it was noted that the TrickBot
Trojan loaded into the memory malicious code developed by Lazarus, which
was downloaded from external servers.
The incidents involved two domains
used by Lazarus from which malicious
code was downloaded:

Based on the dates when the domains
were registered, the organizations were
compromised in April 2019 and January
2020, but the thefts were attempted
one to two months later.

Card processing
In the past, the groups Cobalt,
MoneyTaker, and Silence were reported
to attack card processing systems.
However, recent attacks of this type
were carried out by Silence only, in the
first half of 2019.

group-ib.com

The Philippine government-controlled
United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB)
was robbed in September 2020. The
reports mentioned that the attackers
increased the ATM withdrawal limit from
20,000 pesos to 10 million pesos per
day.

They also gained access to InstaPay,
an interbank transfer system.
As a result, they siphoned 167 million
pesos (USD 3.44 million) from the bank.
Following the investigation, four
Nigerian citizens were arrested.

HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2020/2021

→ Threats to the banking sector

ATM Switch
The only group that leveraged ATM
Switch access during the reporting
period is Lazarus. In August 2020,
US-CERT issued a security alert that

this group had resumed its activity and
that they had malicious code in their
arsenal that could be used to steal
funds through an ATM Switch running

Windows. In the past, this code was
used only to attack AIX operating
system versions. Despite the alert, the
most recent theft was detected in 2018.

ATM
Many groups (Cobalt, MoneyTaker,
Silence, Lazarus) possess ATM Trojans,
but they don't actively use these tools.

It is important to note that the functionality for working with ATMs has been borrowed from xfs-disp.exe, which we described in our report on Silence. The XDA.RAT
source code is therefore based on two projects: dnscat2 and xfs-disp.exe.

In September 2019, Group-IB researchers described a Trojan called Dtrack
used by Lazarus, which was discovered
back in 2018. Since then, it has not been
used for theft purposes.

When the Trojan receives the 9 command, it collects information in the same way
as xfs-disp.exe:

In the second half of 2019, Silence was
the only group to carry out attacks
on banks. They successfully infiltrated
several banks in Chile, Costa Rica,
and Bulgaria, but their attacks were
thwarted at early stages.
In November 2019, two files were
uploaded to VirusTotal from the
Republic of Senegal: xfs.dll and dns.dll.
The xfs.dll file was compiled on October
19, 2019. It is likely that the ATM attack
was carried out on this day, and this
is evidence of the last such successful
attack conducted by Silence. At the
time, the main Trojan used by Silence
was XDA.RAT.
The XDA.RAT source code is based
on an open-source project: https://
github.com/iagox86/dnscat2. The
application supports the following
commands:
— 0: ping command
— 1: create a cmd.exe process
— 2: execute a shell command
— 3: download a file
— 4: upload a file from the infected
device to the C&C server
— 5: close all connections
— 6: change the interval of making
requests to the server
— 7: save the %LOCALAPPDATA%\
updatea.bin file
— 8: overwrite the <%XDA_path%>\
updatea2.bin file
— 9: get information about the connected dispenser
— 10: carry out an ATM jackpotting
attack

group-ib.com

1. It attempts to connect to the following dispenser service providers:
— CashDispenser (Nautilus)
— NXCdm (Nautilus)
— DBD_AdvFuncDisp (Diabold)
— CurrencyDispenser1 (NCR)
— CDM30 (WINCOR)
— GEN (WINCOR GEN)
— ATM (GENERIC)
2. It logs the maximum number of banknotes that can be dispensed in a single
operation (using WFS_INF_CDM_CAPABILITIES).
3. It logs the current status of the dispenser (whether it is connected and busy),
the state of the safe door, the state of the dispenser’s logical cash units, the state
of the shutter, etc. The format is as follows:
state=%d, safedoor=%d, dispenser=%d, stacker=%d
pos=%d, OutputPosition=%d, shutter=%d, transport=%d
...
pos=%d, OutputPosition=%d, shutter=%d, transport=%d

4. It logs information about the status and contents of ATM cassettes. The output
is displayed as a format string:
Id:%s(nr=%d)(l=%d,h=%d), %d|%d|%d of %d [%s][%d][%d],[%d][%d]
...
Id:%s(nr=%d)(l=%d,h=%d), %d|%d|%d of %d [%s][%d][%d],[%d][%d]

The application receives the following parameters with the 10 command:
— Flag.
— If this value is 0, the application withdraws cash from a specific cash unit.
— If this value is 1, the application withdraws cash from all cash units.
— Integer value: Cash unit index
— Integer value: Cash count
The application performs ATM jackpotting attacks in the same way as xfs-disp.exe.
The only difference is that the application can extract a specific amount of money
from a given cash unit.

HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2020/2021

→ Threats to the banking sector

Shift in priorities
The main challenge that threat actors
face when attacking banks is not how
to gain access to the target system,
but how to eventually withdraw and
launder the stolen funds. If attackers
find an opportunity to make the same
amount of money while attracting
less attention from law enforcement
agencies with a higher chance of success, they shift their focus. This is what

happened with Cobalt and Silence.
We still come across the unique
malicious codes used by Cobalt and
Silence, but no related thefts have been
detected.
Presumably Cobalt or some of its members have joined the private Thanos
ransomware affiliate program. This fact
is confirmed by the use of a unique

packer for Thanos ransomware. The
same packer was used by Cobalt for
their unique CobInt Trojan.
Silence did not end their activity
in 2020, either. Group-IB discovered new
C&C servers used in attacks against
atypical targets: medical and industrial
companies in Western Europe.

There are four main threats that could
critically damage retail businesses:
— JS sniffers
— Attacks on POS terminals
— Credential stuffing
— Ransomware
Ransomware attacks are easy to understand and, as a rule, companies are
aware of them. As such, we will discuss
only the first three threats underlying
the carding and mass fraud market.

HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2020/2021

→ Threats to the retail sector

General carding trends
The carding market can be divided into
two main segments: sale of textual
card data (number, expiration date,
holder's name, address, CVV) and sale
of dumps (contents of magnetic stripe
cards).
Textual data is collected using phishing
websites, PC/Android banking Trojans,
and ATMs. Threat actors intercept

Textual
details

such data also by hacking e-commerce
websites and using JS sniffers. The
latter were this year’s main novelty and
are becoming increasingly widespread
among cybercriminals.
Dumps are obtained using skimming
devices and Trojans for computers with
connected POS terminals.

Total amount
(cards)

The carding market has grown from
$880 million last year to $1.9 billion.
The doubling applies to both text data
and dumps. The amount of text data
offered for sale has increased from
12.5 to 28.3 million cards, while dumps
have surged from 41 to 63.7 million.

HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2020/2021

→ Threats to the retail sector

JS sniffers
Over the past year, the number
of attacks on online stores has
increased. This is because the use
of JavaScript sniffers to steal bank
cards has become one of the main
techniques of obtaining large volumes
of payment information. The increase
in attacks was also caused by the trend
of reselling access to various websites
and organizations on underground
forums.
The most popular JS sniffer families
The number of known JS sniffer families
has grown from 38 to 96 compared to the
previous year. Each of the new families
deserves to be analyzed separately.
According to Group-IB's findings, over
the past year nearly 460,000 bank
cards compromised using JS sniffers.
Additionally, 645,000 bank cards were
put up for sale at card shops for a total
of $3.6 million.
The top nine banks that issued the
stolen cards are located in the US, with
170,000 cards in total. Cybercriminals are
also interested in cards issued in Brazil,
Australia, Canada, Spain, the United
Kingdom, India, Singapore, and France.
Lazarus, JS sniffers, and Bitcoin theft
In July 2020, security researchers
reported that the state-sponsored APT
group Lazarus used JS sniffers to steal
credit card data from 25 online stores
worldwide.
Group-IB researchers identified two
campaigns that involved infrastructure
previously seen in attacks attributed
to the North Korean group.
The first campaign began in May 2019.
The attackers used the ClientToken
sniffer family to infect 20 online stores.
The second campaign began in February
or March 2020 and targeted large online
stores. In total, three websites were
infected with the Preloader sniffer.
Group-IB found two websites that the
attackers used to collect cards stolen
during the Preloader campaign, which
may indicate a greater number of victims.
Group-IB researchers also discovered
the BTC Changer campaign, during which
a modified version of ClientToken was
used to spoof the address of a Bitcoin
wallet at the time of payment on online
stores that accept Bitcoin. Specialists
found two websites infected during this
campaign, which brought the attackers
0.66983720 BTC (approximately $7,800).
Sale of access to online stores
Access to hacked online stores — for
the purpose of subsequently deploying
a sniffer — can be purchased on underground forums. The price heavily
depends on the country in which the
store operates, the number of buyers
per day, and the type of payment system

used on the website. If payment is made
in a separate window opened in an iframe
or after being redirected to the payment
system website, then it is more difficult
to deploy a sniffer. Such lots will therefore be cheaper than websites on which
card data is entered on the website itself.
To gain access to a store or install
a JS sniffer, cybercriminals continue
to use known vulnerabilities in popular
e-commerce CMS. They also employ
malicious software to steal passwords
and conduct brute-force attacks
on administrative control panels of stores
or DBMS. For example, threat actors
continue to conduct attacks using the
GoBrut malware written in GoLang. The
program is used to conduct distributed
brute-force attacks on online stores and
administrative panels of popular CMS
such as Magento, OpenCart, phpMyAdmin, and cPanel. Subsequently, the threat
actors leverage access to administrative
panels and administration tools to install
JS sniffers on the target websites.
Evasion techniques
To prevent malicious code from being
detected and removed from the victim
website, cybercriminals use several
techniques.
— Most techniques are based on using
JavaScript to load the main JS sniffer
code when the user is on the checkout page. In the past, JS sniffers were
often loaded from a link using the
script tag.
— Another increasingly popular technique involves concealing the
JS sniffer code within an image. The
injector code downloads the image
from the attackers' server, extracts
the JS sniffer code, and executes
it on the online store page.
— Criminals still use the code for
detecting whether a browser's console is open to avoid being detected

by researchers and security tools. The
malicious code will not be run and will
not execute the main load if it detects
that the browser's developer console
is open on the visitor's website.
— To avoid detection, JS sniffer families
also use several different checks
under the responsibility of the server-side sniffer: the main JS sniffer
code will be obtained only if (i) the
user's IP address does not belong
to the network of a large cloud provider, (ii) the user's country (determined by IP address) corresponds
to the country of the store, and (iii)
the Referer field contains the address
of the infected store's payment
page. If at least one of these checks
fails, a benign JS script of a legitimate library is returned in response
to a sniffer code request.
— Loading the main sniffer code using
JavaScript helps attackers conceal
the address from which the code
is loaded. The simplest code samples
use Base64 to hide links to malicious
JS files. However, we often find
samples of malicious code in which
the link to the JS sniffer is stored
in encrypted form and as a concatenation of parts of a URL address
or a string with a reverse character
order.
— Group-IB Researchers also found
samples of malicious code that used
the Domain Generation Algorithm
(DGA) to obtain the website address
from which the main sniffer code will
be downloaded. The actual address
depended on the exact date that the
attackers created one domain for
each month. If one of the domains
was blocked, all they had to do was
wait and the flow of bank card data
from the infected store would resume.

Attacks on POS terminals
The main product sold by carders is bank
card dumps. In total, 63.7 million dumps
were found for sale during the reporting
period, which is 156% more than last
year.
The main method of compromising
magnetic stripe data is infecting computers with connected POS terminals
with special Trojans that collect data
from RAM. In total, 14 Trojans were found
to be active during the reporting period:

— RtPOS
— TinyPOS
— UdPOS
— FighterPOS
— DiamondFox
— GratefulPOS
— FrameworkPOS

— MajikPOS
— DMSniff
— PinkKite
— BADHATCH
— Pillowmint
— GlitchPOS
— Alina POS

During the reporting period,
Group-IB researchers established that
19 retail chains were compromised,
as a result of which millions of bank
cards were put up for sale.

Credential stuffing
One of the most common security
issues is the credential stuffing technique, i.e. extracting login-password
pairs from various leaks (email, phone
number, and other identification data
can be the login) for subsequent bruteforce attacks.

The problem is that many users choose
the same passwords for different
resources, and if one resource becomes
compromised, the same login credentials could be used on others. It is also
worth noting that currently almost
all major leaks are initially put up for

sale, then become publicly available
on underground forums, which makes
it easy for attackers to collect databases for credential stuffing attacks.
This applies to all retailers with personal
accounts on online resources, but also
to some bank accounts and e-wallets.

points can usually be used to pay for
only a part of a purchase, but in some
cases they can be used to pay for
an entire order.

from the retailer. In some cases, cybercriminals sell access to such accounts.

— A common method of monetizing
reward points is by purchasing goods
that can later be resold. Criminals
purchase gift cards for stores that
sell digital content (e.g., PlayStation
Store, Xbox Store), then resell the
cards or use them to pay in-store.
— If attackers gain access to many user
accounts, they can group reward
points together and pay for a large
number of purchases and/or buy
more expensive goods.
— In some retail chains, bonus points
can be used to pay at checkout
in-store. In such cases, cybercriminals use virtual loyalty cards,
barcodes, and discount coupons
from the user's personal account
to cash in bonus points and pay for
purchases.

Retailers offer users rewards and gifts
for upgrading to a higher level of service
or a more expensive tariff.

Types of monetization
Gaining access to bank accounts
and e-wallets
Bank accounts and e-wallets are among
the most obvious targets for cybercriminals. Hackers prefer attacking online
resources that give direct access to the
victim's money. Some banks provide
access to online banking using the pair
email:password or phone:password,
which makes them attractive targets.
It is difficult for cybercriminals
to directly withdraw funds from banks
because such operations usually require
confirmation (two-factor authentication)
from the account holder. This explains
why this monetization method is not the
most popular one.
That being said, e-wallets do not usually
involve such sophisticated security
measures as those deployed to protect
bank accounts. After gaining access
to the electronic wallet, attackers
attempt to either make purchases
at the victim’s expense or transfer the
funds to another wallet, registered
to a money mule, through various
exchange services.
Monetizing reward points
Online and offline retailers often offer
members of their loyalty programs
cashback for purchases in the form
of reward points or money. Reward

group-ib.com

Monetizing funds for paid services
Some retailers offer services that can
be paid for by topping up a personal
account on the website.

Receiving gift points or goods

Attackers can take advantage of access
to a user's account and independently
transfer it to another level of service
in order to receive a reward. The threat
actor will then sell the reward.
Access to personal data
In the user's personal account on the
retailer's website, attackers can gain
access to the following personal data:
— full name
— contact information (phone number,
email, delivery addresses)
— data about payment methods (bank
card and/or account numbers,
accounts in payment systems)
If personal user data in the retailer's accounts is poorly protected,
attackers can exfiltrate it for subsequent social engineering attacks
or to be sold to other interested parties.

If criminals gain access to a user
account with a positive balance on their
personal account, the threat actors can
use these funds to obtain paid services

page 60 of 78

HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2020/2021

→ Threats to the retail sector

Attack techniques
To carry out such actions, threat actors
need:
— login-password lists from various
leaks
— lists of proxy servers to bypass
blocking due to a limited number of requests allowed from one
IP address
— a program that will receive as input
the lists of logins, proxies, and the
address of the resource to check the
existence of a user with such login
and password details
Tools used to carry out the above
attacks are of the greatest interest
to threat hunters. They can be divided
into three main categories:
— bots without browsers
— browser bots
— hybrid solutions
Bots without browsers
This is the most primitive way to implement such tools. Bots without browsers
are extremely simple, they work reliably
and quickly, but they cannot bypass
anti-bot solutions.
There are many different offers
of ready-made tools on the market, but one of the most widespread
is OpenBullet, an open source tool. Its
main advantage is extensibility. Threat
actors must usually adapt the code
for each online resource, which needs

group-ib.com

to be checked for certain user accounts.
In OpenBullet, as in many other tools,
the code is adapted in configuration
files. This means that many users
write configuration files for different
resources, and the largest of them have
long been on the list.
A distinctive feature of paid resources
is a more comprehensive offer.
Developers of paid tools constantly
update proxy lists and write log parsers
to extract contact and payment information from personal accounts.
Since it is easy to conduct attacks using
bots without browsers, some scammers
prefer to write their own scripts to perform attacks against specific resources.
Hybrid solutions
Since bots without browsers cannot
pass CAPTCHAs and receive cookies,
scammers have developed a hybrid
solution.
Criminals launch the browser either
automatically or manually and receive
cookies. The cookies are then added
to the bot configuration file, after which
the bots check login and password
details (without the need to launch
a browser). This scheme is easy
to implement and, most importantly,
it works quickly and does not require
many computing resources.

that solve the simple types or SaaS
services for their solution. In the
latter case, scammers automatically
send the link to the service via the
API and receive a cookie or a solution
in response.
Hybrid methods can bypass almost all
anti-bot solutions.
Browser bots
It is rare to find resources with reliable
protection. More often than not, these
are large social media or IT giants that
use their own solutions to protect
against bots. In such cases, scammers
write unique browser bots for each
resource.
Browser bots are full-fledged browsers
that automatically start, open pages,
run scripts, and emulate user behavior
on a website.
This variant is much more expensive
than the previous ones. It requires
a great deal of customization, while
running many browsers requires more
server power and, most importantly,
is much slower.

To bypass various types of CAPTCHAs,
hackers can use either separate tools

ransomware
Owners of banking botnets
are following the popular trend

group-ib.com

Every year, several banking botnets disappear from the market and new ones
rarely take their place. This year was
no exception. At this rate, the market for
PC banking Trojans may become nonexistent in three to five years.

HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2020/2021

→ Banking Trojans

Trojans for PC
A total of 19 PC banking Trojans were
active this year, 12 of which were written by Russian-speaking developers.
Six Trojans were developed by Latin
American authors.
Russian-speaking owners of the largest
banking botnets have also followed the
main trend of switching to using ransomware. For example:
— Trickbot uses the following ransomware: Ryuk (later Conti), Kraken,
Thanos
— Dridex uses WastedLocker,
DoppelPaymer; it previously used
BitPaymer, Locky, Bart, and Jaff
— Qbot (Quakbot) started using
ProLock
— zLoader/Silent Night also switched
to using an unidentified ransomware
— RTM, which is the only banking botnet active in Russia, uses Cerber
A shift in focus does not mean that
threat actors stop committing thefts.
If they see an opportunity to transfer
a large amount of money, they will
take it. But as a general rule, their main
income now comes from ransomware.
This change in behavior has led to less
damage from theft and changed the
money laundering market.
Given that the most widespread
banking Trojans used to be developed
by Russian-speaking cybercriminals,
the decrease in thefts has led to this
segment degrading more significantly.

During the analyzed period, only
one new banking Trojan developed
by Russian-speaking authors appeared:
Silent Night. It is an improved version
of the old Axebot Trojan and was used
in attacks on German Internet users.
During the same period, another three
Trojans created earlier by Russianspeaking authors stopped being used
completely: TinyNuke, Panda Banker,
and Osiris.
Russia
The only banking Trojan for PCs
in Russia is RTM, which does not seem
to be used much and will likely soon
cease to exist. This banking botnet uses
Cerber ransomware.
Latin America
Latin America has become the main
source of banking Trojans. In 2020,
five new Trojans emerged: Guildma
(Astaroth), Grandoreiro, Javali, Melcoz,
and Metamorfo. All have been active for
several years, but attracted the attention of researchers only recently.

The developers of these Trojans live
in Latin America and their Trojans are
used locally, although some of them are
starting to attack Europe and the United
States.
USA and Canada
Traditionally, the US and Canada have
been the primary targets for banking
Trojans. Even Latin American developers
have added American banks to their
config files.
Currently, eleven Trojans for PCs pose
a threat to clients of US and Canadian
banks, ten of which were developed by Russian-speaking hackers:
Metamorfo, zLoader/Silent Night,
Gootkit, Trickbot, Gozi, IcedID, Danabot,
Ramnit, Dridex, LokiPWS, and Qbot.
APAC
In the APAC region, banking Trojans
have barely undergone any significant
changes. The key targets are Japan and
Australia, which are attacked using wellknown Trojans: Trickbot, Gozi, Danabot,
Ramnit.

Trojans for Android
The Android Trojan market is similar
to the PC Trojan market. The main developers are Russian-speaking hackers.
However, developers from Latin America
are actively expanding to the market
and use their tools to attack bank customers locally.
In total, ten Android banking Trojans
were active this year, five of which are
brand new.
An author of the Red Alert banking
Trojan with the nickname Sochi stopped
developing Trojans and switched
to working with JS sniffers.
Authors of Android Trojans are not picky
about names. For instance, Alien Bot
appeared in 2020, but Trojans with the
same name but from other developers
had existed before.
Android Trojans mainly use web fakes,
i.e. dialog boxes that request the
information required (passwords, bank
card numbers, etc.) from the victim.
Services offering to develop such web
fakes appeared in the Russian-speaking
underground segment. As a result,
banking Trojan authors no longer need

to spend time supporting certain
applications for collecting financial data.
It is enough to buy a set of web fakes
and the Trojan can be used in almost
any region, which is what usually happens with Trojans created by Russianspeaking cybercriminals.
Russia
Only two Android Trojans were active
in Russia: Flexnet and Anubis. They
did not cause significant damage. For
example, Flexnet spread more massively and was able to infect 50,000
devices and intercept data from just
over 5,000 bank cards.
Anubis spread more selectively, using
landing pages disguised a Russian bank
brand, and infected about 400 clients
in a targeted way.

Latin America
The locally developed BasBanke Trojan
was most active in Latin America.
BasBanke works as part of an affiliate
scheme, i.e. several people can distribute it at once.
USA and Canada
Russian-speaking authors adhere to the
unspoken rule that Android Trojans
should not be used to attack US clients,
although the authors of web fakes are
actively creating windows to collect
data from US financial institutions.
Only two Trojans pose a threat: the new
Alien Bot and BlackRock.
APAC
Threats for the APAC region are posed
by all Trojans developed by Russianspeaking hackers: Anubis, Gustuff,
Cerberus, and the new Alien Bot.

Between H2 2019 and H2 2020, 118%
more phishing resources were identified
and taken down compared to the previous reporting period.

from home. Scammers quickly
adapted to this trend and began
carrying out phishing attacks on services and individual brands, which
previously did not have much financial appeal to them.
— Change of tactics. In previous years,
attackers ended their campaigns
after fraudulent websites were taken
down and quickly switched to other
brands. Today, they are automating
their attacks instead and replacing
the blocked pages with new ones.

This significant growth can be explained
by two main factors:
— The pandemic. During lockdowns,
many attackers had more time
to devote to malicious activity.
In addition, phishing, as one of the
simplest earning schemes, attracted
the attention of a larger audience
as many people lost their income
due to the pandemic.
— On the other hand, lockdowns
increased the demand for online
shopping. More and more people
began to order goods and services

Phishing attacks targeting bookmakers increased in Q2 2020, amounting
to 6% versus 2% in the previous quarter.
Compared to H2 2018-H1 2019, phishing
targeting bookmakers grew by more

than 20% during the reporting period.
Postal services and financial institutions
also remained a key target for attackers.
Another attack type that increased significantly was phishing used to collect
accounts for various online services
such as Microsoft, Netflix, Amazon,
eBay, and Valve Steam.
Phishing resources targeting cryptocurrency projects have disappeared almost
completely. The main reason lies in the
waning interest in ICO projects, which
were a key target for phishers in 2017
and 2018.

Phishing evasion techniques

Affiliate programs

So far, the main 2020 trend is the use
of one-time unique links that become
inactive after the user opens them.
This means that if someone clicks
on the link at least once, it will not
be possible to obtain the same content
again in order to collect evidence. This
significantly complicates the process
of taking down phishing resources.

Phishing scammers cannot do much
damage on their own. As such, there are
affiliate programs that bring together
people who want to make money
by phishing.

Common evasion techniques used
by phishers are listed below:
— One-time links. A unique one-time
link is generated for each user.
— Blocking by subnets. The subnets
of many companies that provide
phishing page detection services
are blacklisted, and if a request for
a page comes from their subnets,
phishing content will not be shown.
— Blocking by user agent. Attackers
understand who their target audience is, and if it is clear from the
user agent that this is not a real user,
phishing content will not be shown.
For example, if a criminal carries out
an attack on mobile device users, all
visitors with a PC browser will not
receive the phishing page. Phishing
kit scripts usually contain a list
of keywords that are checked in the
user agent field.
— Blocking by region. GeoIP databases are actively used by various
criminals and phishing is no exception. If the target audience is located
in Singapore, there is no point
in showing the phishing page
to users in the United States.
— Redirects to official
websites. If some checks are
failed, instead of phishing content
visitors will be redirected to the
attacked brand’s official website
or to websites belonging to other
legal services.

group-ib.com

In Russia, the main reason for the significantly higher numbers of phishing
attacks is the emergence of various
affiliate programs for hackers wanting
to make money off phishing involving
fake bank rewards programs, lottery
draws, paid surveys, and more. At the
final stage of the scam, the victim
is prompted to enter their payment
details or make a transfer.
The affiliates distribute links to as many
people as possible. Affiliate program
organizers create landing pages, accept
payments, and help launder money. For
example, in a short period of time, one
of the affiliate programs created more
than 12,000 accounts of money mules
to transfer stolen money.
So far, this trend has been observed
only in Russia. Russia is often used
as a testing ground, so similar schemes
are likely to appear in other countries.
Automated management
of phishing projects
Since the start of the year, there has
been a rise in advanced social engineering, namely when multi-stage scenarios
are used in a phishing attack. As part
of such increasingly popular phishing schemes, threat actors first stake
out the victim: they establish contact
with the target individual (e.g., through
a messenger), create an atmosphere
of trust, and only then do they direct
the victim to a phishing page.

stolen funds through dedicated
Telegram channels and bots. A typical
infrastructure for such a project built
around Telegram might include the
following features:
— a bot for recruiting, where information about a new potential cybergroup member is entered (scamming experience, age, link to a profile
on the forum, etc.)
— a bot for displaying information
about successful thefts (nickname
in Telegram, how much money was
made and how)
— private channels for interaction/communication/support for members
of the scam group
— bots for generating phishing links
based on certain settings, which
are introduced by group members
during attacks
In addition to the traditional phishing kits, underground hacker forums
nowadays offer ready-made management platforms designed to automate
phishing projects. Thanks to such platforms distributed as SaaS, the number
of groups that can be easily scaled
is growing. The number of members
in a group built around such platforms can reach several dozen people.
Automating management of a criminal
group in turn leads to the emergence
and spread of more complex social
engineering. The latter is slowly starting
to be used in large-scale attacks and
not only in targeted attacks as before.

Communications between members
of such new criminal gangs are especially interesting. Hackers coordinate
attacks, communicate, and distribute

RECOMMENDATIONS
FOR TOP MANAGEMENT

HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2020/2021

→ Recommendations for top management

Three pillars of information security
Technologies
Nowadays, threat actors are continuously innovating.
Criminals implement new tools with more enthusiasm and
much faster than many companies. This is what affects the
balance of power on the information security battlefield. Take
advantage of the latest developments and solution classes
available on the market to prevent your opponent from gaining the upper hand.
Team

IS*

Even the latest generation of automated security systems
are managed by a team. It is this team of specialists that
determines how much of the product's capabilities you use
and therefore the effectiveness of the solution. Learning and
innovation must become a continuous process.
Processes
The number of people in your response team and existence
of playbooks is just as important as the coherence and
interchangeability of each unit within that team. Consultants
always advise you to assign roles in the team, but do you
conduct "rehearsals" on a regular basis? Do all team members
know how they should act in any given situation? Involve your
team in creating a playbook and establish effective interaction between teams and employees.

*Information security

General recommendations
Threat hunting
and proactive defense

Monitoring and proactive threat detection are not new for the cyber industry, but not everyone
is managing to implement these processes. You need to constantly collect and match indicators
of compromise and TTPs of attackers. Train your team in new techniques, improve their skills,
and provide them with the latest tools.

Hygiene
and hygiene

Phishing and social engineering have remained the most popular vectors of initial compromise. Ordinary employees hold their defenses behind their monitors and inboxes every day.
Establishing a password policy and conducting training and social engineering testing will help
protect against phishing and prevent corporate data leaks.

Trust MSS providers
and partners

Product innovations aren’t slowing down their momentum, and technical skills are always
needed to ensure information security. Therefore, more companies are delegating part or most
of their information security tasks to MSS providers. Doing so not gets best-in-class technical
specialists at your side without hiring but also is beneficial for budget allocation.

Keep in touch with
your competitors

To raise awareness of new threats, you need to go beyond professional trainings and start a dialogue with colleagues from your industry. Competitors could become your partners in the fight
against common enemies: APTs, pro-state groups, ransomware attacks, and others.

Checkups and cyber
risk insurance

Just as people need regular checkups, so do companies need to regularly assess their security
infrastructures. Nowadays, this applies not only to infrastructure but also to teams and processes. The standard set of checkups should be supplemented with a third-party audit as well
as an assessment of potential retrospective compromise. It is important to note that the above
does not negate the importance of cyber risk insurance, especially when you are responsible for
the information of your customers and employees.

Measuring
performance

Information security is becoming more expensive for companies, which is why many are
requesting that the effectiveness of solutions be measured and compared. The saturated
market dictates the new rules: solutions should not just be modern and efficient but also
advantageous for businesses. Comparing costs to the effectiveness of a tool in its pilot stage
also requires defining business metrics that differ in one way or another from the size of the
company and its infrastructure. Analysts from Gartner, Forrester, and other analytical agencies
handle the market's requests to collect performance measurements and their metrics.

HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2020/2021

→ Recommendations for top management

Recommendations for how to set up your technical
infrastructure and train your information security team
— Hunt for traces of covert activity
by threat actors in the company
network. This helps stop an ongoing
attack for which the initial stages were
overlooked by the organization's security controls.
— Implement a Malware Detonation
Platform that allows for suspicious
files and links to be run in an isolated
environment, be analyzed in detail,
and subsequently blocked if found
to be malicious.
— Use a Threat intelligence solution
to identify threats, leaks, breaches,
and other hacker activity before they
can harm you.
— Back up regularly. Any backups must
be separated from the main network
so that they cannot be accessed
by threat actors if administrator
accounts become compromised.
— Conduct round-the-clock monitoring
of information security events and
be prepared to promptly respond.

Unfortunately, it is not always possible to detect attacks at early stages:
threat actors continuously improve their
skills and implement new techniques
to gain access to networks of various
size. Detecting traces of compromise
at different stages of the cyber kill chain
requires an ia ntegrated approach. This
approach involves creating a centralized
data source about what is happening
in the network infrastructure and isolating compromised hosts. XDR solutions
can be used for these purposes, as they
are able to detect malicious activity

— Each incident should be matched with
its level of complexity. Incidents that
require analysis should be investigated, the causes and consequences should be identified, and the
problems that caused the incident
should be fixed. For the second level
of response, it is important to have
a third-party incident response team
with pre-negotiated agreement that
can assist in stopping a complex
targeted attack.
— Make sure that your team has the
necessary skills to perform threat
hunting and collect threat intelligence.
— Conduct regular digital hygiene training for employees.

— Conduct periodic fraud risk assessments to see if your solutions and procedures can defend against existing
attacks and fraudulent schemes that
use different attack channels. Identify
the main risk factors, and start from
existing and possible problems when
choosing a fraud protection solution.
— Create a layered protection for your
web portal using not only transaction
analysis, but also solutions for session
analysis of behavior and devices,
and unveil fraudulent operations that
occur on your web channel. Leave
only legitimate users on your portal
and take actions regarding blocking
suspicious users or bots.

— Perform security assessments
in a format that simulates real-life
actions taken by cybercriminals. This
approach will help identify weaknesses in the company's IT infrastructure and determine whether
the company is ready to combat real
cyberattacks.

at various layers, regardless of the tactics, techniques, and procedures used
by threat actors.
Reducing cyber attacker dwell time also
requires not only high-quality response
but also proactive analysis, which can
be carried out both by the organization's employees with relevant competencies and by outsourced experts.
The latter speeds up the investigation
and improves the quality of analysis
significantly.

Both reactive and proactive approaches
require not only relevant competencies
but also a significant amount of cyber
threat intelligence data. Strategic,
operational and tactical threat data help
organizations identify attackers during
the ongoing analysis and detect signs
of compromise at the earliest stages.

→ Technical recommendations for counteracting cyberattacks

Primitive errors: vulnerable
software versions in publicly
accessible services or weak
passwords; vulnerabilities
with public exploits

— Update software regularly.
— Automatically inventory software to identify outdated
programs.
— Regularly conduct security assessments and penetration
testing to identify weaknesses in the network and establish
possible attack vectors.
— Enhance your password policy.
— Implement multi-factor authentication.
— Implement VPNs to protect services on the external network
perimeter. If this is not an option, set up an SSO.

Distributed brute-force
attacks on remote access
interfaces (RDP, SSH, VPN)
and other services (using
new botnets)
IoT botnet owners selling
access to devices installed
on corporate
networks

— Make an inventory of the external network perimeter, firewall
rules, and network address translation (NAT) rules to prevent
services from being externally accessible by mistake.
— Do not, under any circumstances or even temporarily, make
devices that can easily be compromised accessible from the
Internet. These include devices used for video surveillance,
smart homes, office equipment (printers, scanners, and multifunctional devices), and storage such as NAS servers in the
SOHO segment.
— Ensure that remote access services for operating systems
are not accessible externally (e.g., RDP, SSH, VNC, SMB/RPC).
— If this cannot be avoided, change the SSH/RDP port
to a non-default one and implement a white list
of IP addresses that can access these services.
— Ensure that remote access meets the following
requirements:
— Multi-factor authentication.
— Enhanced password policy.
— The ability to restrict network access for the tasks
of a specific account (e.g., contractors are granted
access only to servers they need, not the entire segment
or network).
— Set fields such as "expires at" for accounts and access rules
in case manual revocation of remote access fails.
— Make an inventory of the external network perimeter,
firewall rules, and network address translation (NAT) rules
to prevent services from being externally accessible
by mistake.
— Do not, under any circumstances and even temporarily,
make devices that can be easily compromised accessible from the Internet: video surveillance devices, smart
home devices, office equipment (printers, scanners, and
multifunctional devices), and storage devices such as NAS
servers in the SOHO segment.
— Ensure that remote access services for operating systems
are not accessible externally (e.g., RDP, SSH, VNC, SMB/
RPC, etc.).
— If this cannot be avoided, change the SSH/RDP port
to a non-default one and implement a white list
of IP addresses that can access these services.
— Ensure that remote access meets the following
requirements:
— Multi-factor authentication.
— Enhanced password policy.
— The ability to restrict network access for the tasks
of a specific account (e.g., contractors are granted

HI-TECH CRIME TRENDS 2020/2021

→ Technical recommendations for counteracting cyberattacks

Ransomware

— Be prepared to identify signs of initial compromise,
methods used to achieve persistence in the system, and
lateral movement. Although attack techniques are usually
primitive and can be detected with the naked eye, more
advanced attacks can be identified only by hunting for
threats.
— Regularly check your infrastructure for known bad indicators
of compromise.
— The success of ransomware affiliate programs depends
on an organization's overall level of security. We recommend
using security systems such as Group-IB Threat Hunting
Framework and Group-IB Threat Intelligence
& Attribution.

Post-exploitation frameworks: a free tool called
Metasploit and a cracked
version of Cobalt Strike.
Less often, the frameworks
PoshC2 and Koadic.

— Ensure that your security tools are able to detect tracks
of popular post-exploitation frameworks.
— Ensure that a sufficient number of different and unique
data sources are used when assessing the security level
of your infrastructure and preparing for attacks.

Supply-chain attacks

— Ensure that your current security tools are able to detect
anomalous activity when legitimate software is being used.
Such activity may include launches of atypical processes,
creation of files, and file system or registry modifications
that are usually used to achieve persistence in the system.
— Common security tools are usually unable to handle such tasks, therefore we recommend considering
Group-IB Threat Hunting Framework.

Privilege escalation using
various software (e.g.,
Mimikatz, LaZagne) or
brute-force attacks

To counteract Mimikatz, we recommend:

Tools for attacks on physically isolated networks
that use USB devices
for jumping the air gap

Do not use untrusted USB devices or USB devices of unknown/
questionable origin.

group-ib.com

— Update your systems to Windows 10/2016 with the
Credentials Guard feature.
— Use the Protected Users group for administrator accounts.
— Build a privileged access management system in accordance with Microsoft recommendations.
— If you believe that attackers may bypass the methods listed
above, or if it is impossible to implement the above recommendations, ensure that the existing security controls are
able to detect the use of Mimikatz (most often launched
using post-exploitation frameworks).
— Log access to lsass.exe process memory and identify suspicious processes that may perform such activity.

BGP hijacking
and route leaks

How successfully you repel such attacks largely depends
on other Internet users.

Attacks on card processing and interbank transfer
systems

The success of such attacks is highly dependent on your
organization's level of security.

JS sniffers

— Regularly update CMS and plugins, and control versions
of website files.
— Enhance the password policy for administrative accounts
on websites.
— Use Group-IB Fraud Hunting Platform to detect web
injections.

Attacks on POS terminals

There are no specific recommendations, as the success
of such attacks is highly dependent on your organization's level of security.

— Implement Group-IB Threat Hunting Framework and Threat
Intelligence systems to check whether your organization
has been compromised

— Implement Group-IB Threat Hunting Framework and
Group-IB Threat Intelligence & Attribution systems to check
whether your organization has been compromised

— Implement Group-IB Threat Hunting Framework and
Group-IB Threat Intelligence & Attribution to check your
organization for compromise.

Credential stuffing

— Prevent users from registering on any third-party services using corporate emails. Users tend to use the same
password on multiple services or modify their passwords.
If passwords are leaked from one service, a hacker can
attack a given company directly.
— A threat actor can use a breached password to conduct
a social engineering attack against a specific user.
— Check databases of leaked credentials for your accounts
(e.g., using Group-IB Threat Intelligence & Attribution).

New records in DDoS attack
volume: 2.3 Tb per second
and 809 million packets
per second

— Switch to using an external balancer or proxy service;
increase architecture complexity; and move IP addresses
to external services to protect your entire infrastructure.
— Increase bandwidth.
— Purchase filtering hardware.
— Switch to operators with relevant anti-DDoS capacities.

Banking botnets, Trojans
(TrickBot, Qbot, Silent Night
and others)

1. Attack on vulnerable software: browsers, operating systems
— Perform timely software updates
— Do not click on suspicious links
— Do not install software from untrusted sources
2. Phishing campaigns:
— Do not open suspicious emails and attachments.
— Use Group-IB Threat Hunting Framework and similar solutions.
Such Trojans are well known and leave specific traces in the
target system. Make sure to install security tools that will detect
and repel Trojans in your infrastructure.

Web phishing and
social engineering

Recommendations for marketplace customers:
— Pay attention to domain names, especially those shown
in search engine ads and conversations with sellers.
— Do not switch to communicating outside marketplaces, since chat histories will not be saved, and the
resource's anti-fraud rules will not work.
— Pay attention to the seller rating.
Recommendations for marketplaces:
— Create a fraud prevention system.
— Use Group-IB Fraud Hunting Platform.
Recommendations for other websites,
online stores, and their visitors:
— Check the date when the domain name was registered and
whether the domain is spelled correctly.
— Check the website content, including product descriptions
and user reviews.
— Be attentive to websites that appear on the top of advertising in search engines. Cybercriminals often buy such ads
to promote their websites.
— Be attentive to websites where the price of products
is set too low.
— Implement Group-IB Fraud Hunting Platform
and Group-IB Digital Risk Protection.

Growing demand for Linux
malware designed to achieve
persistence in the network
and escalate privileges

— Install packages only using official repositories
— Carefully check information about developers of packages
that are not available in official repositories.
— Follow general cybersecurity recommendations of the
Linux communities (e.g., remove SUID bits off unnecessary
binaries).
— Use minimum privileges when using untrusted software.

Mobile RATs

— Do not install untrusted software
— Do not listen to intruders trying to persuade you to install
TeamViewer and any other software to connect a tech
support employee.
— Update software and operating systems in a timely manner.
For our clients: use Group-IB Fraud Hunting Platform, which
is able to detect active RATs on mobile devices.

Gaining access to SCADA
systems at industrial enterprises to manipulate production processes

— The success of such attacks is highly dependent on your
organization's level of security.
— Implement Group-IB's Threat Hunting Framework and
Group-IB Threat Intelligence & Attribution systems to check
whether your organization has been compromised

Exploits and spyware suits
for Android and iOS

— Do not visit untrusted/suspicious websites.
— Do not install software from unverified sources.
— Perform timely updates of operating systems and software
— Separate personal and work devices.
— Use one device for work, the other for personal life, do not
mix them.
— Use Group-IB Fraud Hunting Platform and Group-IB Threat
Intelligence & Attribution (with notifications on new attacks,
new software, and exploits).

Initial compromise
through VPN servers

— Ensure that remote access meets the following
requirements:
— Multi-factor authentication
— Enhanced password policy
— The ability to restrict network access for the tasks
of a specific account (e.g., contractors are granted
access only to servers they need, not the entire segment or network)
— Set fields such as "expires at" for accounts and access
rules in case manual revocation of remote access fails.
