Introduction
Charming Kitten is an Iranian cyberespionage group operating since approximately 2014. This report exposes
their vast espionage apparatus, active during 2016-2017. We present incidents of company impersonation,
made up organizations and individuals, spear phishing and watering hole attacks. We analyze their
exploitation, delivery, and command-and-control infrastructure, and expose DownPaper, a malware
developed by the attackers, which has not been publicly documented to date.
Incidents documented in this report are likely a small fraction of the actual amount of targeted attacks,
which may reach thousands of individuals. We expose more than 85 IP addresses, 240 malicious domains,
hundreds of hosts, and multiple fake entities – most of which were created in 2016-2017. The most recent
domains (com-archivecenter[.]work, com-messengerservice[.]work and com-videoservice[.]work) were
registered on December 2nd, 2017, and have probably not been used in attacks yet.
We present the connection between Behzad Mesri, an Iranian national recently indicted for his involvement
in hacking HBO, and Charming Kitten. We also identify other members of the group.
This report refers to two likely distinct groups, Charming Kitten and Rocket Kitten, together. This is not to
say that the two groups are one, but that due to overlap in infrastructure, tools, targets, and modus
operandi we are unable to precisely attribute each incident to one or the other. Further discussion appears
in the section "Charming Kitten or Rocket kitten?"

Targets
The attackers' focus appears to be individuals of interest to Iran in the fields of Academic research (i.e.
Iranists - Scholars who study Iran), Human right and media. Emphasis is given to Iranian dissidents living in
Iran or abroad, and people who come in touch with Iranians or report on Iranian affairs such as journalists
and reporters, media outlets covering Iran, and political advisors.
Most targets known to us are individuals living in Iran, the United States, Israel, and the UK. Others live in
Turkey, France, Germany, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, India, Denmark and other countries.
Notably, the attackers usually try to gain access to private email and Facebook accounts. They seek to
infiltrate the targets’ social network as a hop point to breach other accounts in their social network, or to
collect information about their targets. Sometimes, they aim at establishing a foothold on the target’s
computer to gain access into their organization, but, based on our data, this is usually not their main
objective, as opposed to other Iranian threat groups, such as Oilrig1 and CopyKittens2.

Charming Kitten or Rocket kitten?
While Iranian threat actors have been well documented by security researchers, the inner workings of the
ecosystem of Iran's hackers is not entirely clear. Groups can be vigorously active for years and then
disappear abruptly, sometimes due to being publicly outed. Researchers make a best-faith effort to assign
operations to certain groups, but the instability in the field makes the process challenging.
A case of these obscure lines can be found in a blogpost published in coordination and parallel to this report
-“Flying Kitten to Rocket Kitten, A Case of Ambiguity and Shared Code”3 by Collin Anderson and Claudio
Guarnieri. Flying Kitten (which is another name given by the security industry to Charming Kitten) was one of
the first groups to be described as a coherent threat actor conducting operations against political opponents
of the IRI (Islamic Republic of Iran) government and foreign espionage targets. FireEye’s publication of
“Operation Saffron Rose” report, which described Flying Kitten’s operations against aviation firms, led to the
dismantling of Flying kitten's infrastructure and the apparent end of its activities. Months later, another,
seemingly distinct group, “Rocket Kitten,” would be described by a series of reports.
While the two groups exhibited different behaviors that lend credence to the assumption they were distinct,
disclosures of private toolkits strongly suggest that Rocket Kitten had used Flying Kitten resources
throughout its credential-theft operations. Moreover, Rocket Kitten had experimented with reusing malware
that appeared to be an undisclosed precursor to Flying Kitten's “Stealer” agent documented by FireEye.
These overlaps provide some indication that Rocket Kitten had some relationship to Flying Kitten – perhaps
members of the latter joining the new team. Rocket Kitten has since largely subsided as a formidable actor,
and repeating the theme of its predecessor now only appears in echoes of other campaigns.

The HBO hacker and Charming Kitten
HBO hacking indictment
In November 21, 2017, the United States Department of Justice unsealed an indictment4 against Behzad
Mesri (A.K.A “Skote Vahshat”)5 for his involvement hacking and extorting HBO, and for subsequently leaking
the stolen content on the Internet. Leaked content included confidential information about upcoming
episodes of the popular television series, “Game of Thrones,” and video files containing unreleased episodes
of other television series created by HBO6.

According to the indictment, "Mesri is an Iran-based computer hacker who had previously worked on behalf
of the Iranian military to conduct computer network attacks that targeted military systems, nuclear software
systems, and Israeli infrastructure. At certain times, Mesri has been a member of an Iran-based hacking
group called the Turk Black Hat security team".

Connection to Iranian government backed threat agent
Security researcher Collin Anderson of Iran Threats7 tagged Mesri's twitter account8 in a tweet9 suggesting
that Mesri might be related to Charming Kitten.

Other stolen content includes: (a) confidential video files containing unaired episodes of original HBO television
programs, including episodes of “Barry,” “Ballers,” “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” “Room 104,” and “The Deuce”; (b) scripts
and plot summaries for unaired programs, including but not limited to episodes of “Game of Thrones”; (c) confidential
cast and crew contact lists; (d) emails belonging to at least one HBO employee; (e) financial documents; and (f) online
credentials for HBO social media accounts (collectively, the “Stolen Data”).

Subsequently, we tried to find connections of Mesri to other activities and people mentioned in this report.
Thanks to the public nature of how Mesri and other members of Turk Black Hat conducted their hacking
activities and private online life, we could find several connections. This is not to say that the HBO hack was
ordered by the Iranian government. Rather, we try to strengthen the assumption that Mesri was, at a certain
time, part of, or related to Charming Kitten. In addition, we unmask other members of the group based on
their connection to Mesri and to Charming Kitten infrastructure.

From Mesri to Charming Kitten
ArYaIeIrAN (AKA aryaieiran@gmail.com AKA aryaieiran@hotmail.com AKA mno_1988_fgh@yahoo.com)
is a 29 years old Iranian hacker and member of Turk Black Hat. Below is his profile page in "Iranian
engineers club"10:

A list of websites he defaced, listed on Zone-H11:

And a mirror page of a defacement he made in 2012, showing some of his team members and email address:

The same email address, aryaieiran@gmail.com, shows up in the SOA (Start of Authority) record of multiple
domains registered and used by Charming Kittens that are presented in this report. These include
britishnews.com[.]co, britishnews[.]org, broadcastbritishnews[.]com and mehrnews[.]info. All these websites
used persiandns[.]net as their NS (name server), as can be seen in PassiveTotal12 13:

aryaieiran@gmail.com also registered persiandns[.]net, potentially indicating that he is the administrator of
the services and an employee in the company:

In a defacement, still online at the time of writing, both ArYaIeIrAn and Skote_Vahshat, the HBO hacker, take
credit as members of Turk Black Hat. This indicates that both were members of Turk Black Hat at the same
time, and likely knew each other.

persiandns[.]net hosting services, which hosted malicious domains used by charming kitten, redirects to
mahanserver[.]ir, indicating it is the same company:

The about page (‫ )درباره ما‬of mahanserver[.]ir leads to a 404 error page:

Page 10 of 59
©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017

The CEO of mahanserver[.]ir is Mohammad Rasoul Akbari (A.K.A ra3ou1), likely the boss or partner of
ArYaIeIrA:

The two follow each other on twitter:

Akbari is a Facebook friend of the HBO hacker, Behzad Mesri 14.

On Linkedin, MahanServer only has two employees: CEO Mohammad Rasoul Akbari and Mohammadamin
Keshvari:

Interestingly, Mohammadamin Keshvari's profile picture is a pomegranate, like that of ArYaIeIrAN’s twitter
account15:

Moreover, Mohammadamin Keshvari mentions in his LinkedIn profile that he works at ARia Dc (ariadc[.]com,
ariadc[.]net) which was registered by aryaieiran@gmail.com for three days in 2013 before changing to a
generic email16:

ARia Dc later turned into MahanServer, as can be seen in Waybac Machine:

To sum up, the HBO hacker - Behzad Mesri is a member of Turk Black Hat along with ArYaIeIrAn, who
provides infrastructure for Charming Kitten activity via PersianDNS / Mahanserver together with
Mohammad Rasoul Akbari, who is a Facebook friend of Behzad Mesri's. We tend to identify ArYaIeIrAn with
Mohammadamin Keshvari, because the latter is the only other employee of Mahanserver and works in a
company whose domain was registered by the former (and both have a similar and unique profile picture).
We estimate with medium certainty that the three are directly connected to Charming Kitten, and
potentially, along with others – are Charming Kitten.
We used SocialNet, Shadow Dragon’s Maltego transform for social media analysis17 to analyze these
connections and visually depict them, as can be seen below:

Delivery and Infection
Charming Kitten attack their targets using the following methods:
•
•
•
•

Made up organizations and people – entities are made up to lure people into malicious websites or
to receive malicious messages.
Impersonating real companies – real companies are impersonated, making victims believe they are
communicating or visiting the website of the real companies.
Watering hole attacks – inserting malicious JavaScript code into breached strategic websites.
Spear phishing – pretending to be Gmail, Facebook, and other services providers, or pretending to
be a friend of the target sharing a file or a link.

These methods are elaborated below.

Made up organizations and people
British News
Charming kitten regularly target international media outlets with Persian-language services. Two recent
reports – "How Iran tries to control news coverage by foreign-based journalists"18 and "Iranian agents
blackmailed BBC reporter with ‘naked photo’ threats"19 describe harassment and intimidation methods
applied by Iranian intelligence agencies. These campaigns often target reporters and journalists in phishing
attempts.
On the same note, we identified a fake-news agency "established" by the attackers, called “The British news
agency” or “Britishnews” (inspired by BBC)20. Its website domain is britishnews.com[.]co and two other
domains, broadcastbritishnews[.]com and britishnews[.]org, redirected to it. Below are screenshots of the
main page of the website, which is online at time of writing:

Below is a screenshot from the “about” page of the fake news agency website, detailing its objectives and
giving the email addresses of various “employees”:

Page 17 of 59
©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017

Note the use of present perfect instead of past simple in "has been established" (instead of "was
established"), present progressive (we are covering) instead of present simple (we cover) to mark a habitual
aspect, and "began this work" – all suggesting a Persian-thinking writer.
This fake news-agency and accompanying social media accounts are not used to disseminate propaganda or
false information. Their content was automatically copied from legitimate sources. The purpose of this news
agency is to create legitimacy, with the end goal of reaching out to their targets and infecting them while
visiting the infected website.
The website contains BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework – a penetration testing tool that focuses on web
browsers), however it seems that the payload is sent only when the victim visits the site from IPs in a whitelist
managed by the attackers. This might indicate they are after specific targets or organizations rather than
widespread infection.
The screenshot below shows w3school.hopto[.]org, which served BeEF, called when britishnews.com[.]co is

Made up studens and jurnalists
Multiple Israeli Iranist and middle east researchers were sent emails and Twitter direct messages by made up
entities. These entities are reviewed below.
Zehavit Yehuda
One of the fake entities is “KNBC News journalist Zehavit Yehuda”, who sent the following phishing email:

The email links to a website, https://sites.google[.]com/view/docs-downloads, which was built with Google
Sites:

Page 24 of 59
©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017

The Download button is a redirection link:
http://www.google[.]com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fdownload-google.comorginallinks.ga%2Fdownload%2Ffile%2Fusr%<redacted>&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=<redacted>
Which leads to a fake log-in page in a domain registered by the attackers:
http://download-google.com-orginal-links[.]ga/download/file/usr/<redacted>

Yafa Hyat
Fake entity "Yafa Hyat" (@yafa1985hyat, online at time of writing) has contacted an
Israeli Iranist via a direct message on twitter, pretending to be a political researcher who
needs help with an article:

Page 25 of 59
©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017

The researcher was asked to read the article in her "google account", which was also a phishing page in Google
sites: https://sites.google[.]com/site/yaffadocuments/ :

Page 26 of 59
©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017

The site automatically redirects to a phishing website hosted in a domain registered by the attackers, downloadgoogle.orginal-links[.]com:

"Yafa" also sent an email from yaffa.hyatt9617@gmail.com to a university professor, asking to work at the
university center she is heading. The email itself did not contain malicious content, and was likely sent to build
trust prior to sending a phishing link or malware:

Page 27 of 59
©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017

Bahar Azadeh
Fake entity "Bahar Azadeh" (bahra.azadeh88@gmail.com and @baharazadeh122, online at time of writing)
sent emails with different background stories to multiple researchers. In two cases, she was a "Jewish girl
who has an Iranian origin and who has studied in the field of political science":

22

https://twitter.com/baharazadeh1

Yet in a third case she claimed to be Baha'i living in Tehran:

Translation:
Hello,
Mr. Dr., I am a Bahai living in Tehran, if you can call it a life. As you know, the present situation in Iran for
us Bahais is not good at all, so that we are even deprived of our natural right, that is, higher education, as
if we Bahais are not human and have no right to live.
<redacted>, I have been accepted to universities all across Iran, and after two years of studying in a
university, they realized from certain sources that I was Bahai, and expelled me. I did not sit idle and began
to constantly protest, I've been summoned [to court] quite a few times for this thing, and I already feel
Iran has become a hell for me, and as much as I try I can't find salvation from this hell.
One of the reasons I've asked you for help and guidance was reading your book (<redacted>), and your
research in this field has been really valuable and helpful, which made this book so beautiful.
"I have a few questions for you, please answer me".
The entities’ email address is connected to a fake Facebook entity called Emilia Karter
(online at time of writing):

Impersonating real companies
United Technologies impersonation
The attackers created a website impersonating UTC (United Technologies), “an American multinational
conglomerate which researches, develops and manufactures products in numerous areas, including aircraft
engines, [and] aerospace systems […]. UTC is a large military contractor, getting about 10% of its revenue
from the U.S. government”23. The fake website was first reported by Iran Threats researchers on 6 February
201724. We do not have evidence that UTC was targeted or impacted.
The fake website, which was built in January 2017, claimed to offer “Free Special Programs And Courses For
Employees Of Aerospace Companies like Lockheed Martin, SNCORP, ….”. It was a decoy to make visitor
download a “Flash Player”, which was in fact DownPaper malware, analyzed later in this report.

Watering holes
The attackers breached the following websites pertaining to Iranian and Jewish cultural affairs:
Breached website

hamijoo[.]com

An Iranian crowdfunding platform

www.jewishjournal[.]com

A Jewish news site

www.estherk[.]com

A personal blog of one of JewishJournal's writers

A sex education website for Iranian youth

levazand[.]com

A personal blog of an Iranian living in United sates

A script tag that loads BeEF JavaScript from w3school.hopto[.]org or from bootstrap.serveftp[.]com was
added, as can be seen in the images below:

Spear Phishing for credential stealing
The attackers sent hundreds, maybe thousands, of spear phishing emails to hundreds of targets. In this section,
we will present samples of spear phishing emails25.

Wave 1
The attackers breached the Gmail account of Alon Gur Arye, an Israeli film producer. Alon produced a satire
film about the Israeli Mossad, which potentially confused the attackers to thinking he is associated with the
Israeli Mossad. The breached account was used to send a phishing email to Thamar Eilam Gindin (who is
targeted by the group since 201526). Below is a screenshot of the phishing email:

The email contained a shortened bit.ly link to a domain registered by the attackers - drivers.documentsupportsharing[.]bid. In the statistics and usage page of the bit.ly URL we can see that the first click, likely a
test run performed by the attackers before sending the phish, was from Iran.

Names of victims and targets are shared with their permission.
See , Thamar Reservoir: http://www.clearskysec.com/thamar-reservoir/

The phishing page pretends to be a Gmail shared document downed page that requires the visitor to log in:

Page 35 of 59
©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017

Wave 2
Sometimes the phishing email does not contain live text, but only an image of text linked to a phishing page.
This is usually done to bypass text based spam filters.
The attackers used WebRTC (code copied from Github27) to detect the real IP address of targets who use
proxies (This method was documented by Iran Threats28):

While sending the spear phishing, the attackers preformed password recovery on the target’s Facebook
account, as can be seen below. Thus, she received fake emails and legitimate ones at the same time which
could cause her confusion and subsequently to give her credentials in the phishing.

Wave 3
The attackers often open a new Gmail account and send phishing emails from it. For example,
suspended.user.noitification@gmail.com was used to send the following email to targets:

Which leads to:

Page 37 of 59

In other cases, 7 different targeted phishing emails were sent to the same victim on the same day from
customers.mailservice@gmail.com:

Page 39 of 59
©All rights reserved to ClearSky Cyber Security, 2017

The phishing messages were sent to hundreds of recipients from a previously unknown email address:
mails.customerservices@gmail.com
They contained a link to goo-gle[.]mobi
Below are screen captures of two of the messages. The content is not copied directly from Googles original
notices, as evident from the spelling and grammatical errors, some of them typical of Persian speakers, e.g.
using direct speech where English would use indirect speech ("that" instead of "whether"):

Hamed Hashemi, an Iranian Independent researcher and photographer living in the Netherlands was targeted
in this campaign. He detected the malicious emails and wrote about them in his twitter account29 30:

Translation: "The brothers'31 new method for hacking e-mails. Do not be fooled by such an email".

Other reported receiving 6 spear phishing emails within a few minutes. For example, Soudeh Rad32 board
member at ILGAEurope33 (an organization for human rights and equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and
intersex people at European level):

Translation: "What's the most important thing to do when you're under a phishing attack? Keep your calm

account."

Behrang Tajdin34 a BBC Persian TV Reporter said35 36 he was targeted in a similar campaign in April 2017:

attempt to hack your google and Gmail account."

for "if you wait you regret" “

Email tracking services
The attackers often use mailtrack.io to track when phishing emails are opened. These services are often used
by marketing people to monitor their campaign effectiveness. Below is the source code of a spear phishing
email with a mailtrack.io tracking link:

Sometimes the attackers used a similar email tracking service, by Pointofmail. In this case, the malicious
email was sent from Pointofmail’s servers (this is part of their service, not due to a breach). The email
contained a redirect link to legitimate address advmailservice.com:

Which redirects several times, eventually reaching the malicious page:

Email address customers.mailservice@gmail.com was mostly used for spear phishing. Occasionally, it was
used to deliver links to malware. For example, the email below linked to http://tinyurl[.]com/hjtaeak which
redirected to http://login.radio-m[.[cf/i/10-unique-chocolates-in-the-world.zip. The final URL contained the
same sample of DownPaper that was hosted in the fake UTC website mentioned above
(be207941ce8a5e212be8dde83d05d38d).

Note, that the person who “shared” the file with the target in the malicious email was indeed a Facebook
friend of the target (the target shared a link by her a few hours prior to receiving this message), and the
subject of chocolate was trending on the target's feed at the time. The attackers spied on the target
(potentially by following her on various social networks), and crafted an email she would be likely to receive.

DownPaper Malware
DownPaper, sometimes delivered as sami.exe, is a Backdoor trojan. Its main functionality is to download
and run a second stage.
The sample used in our analysis (3261d45051542ab3e54fa541f132f899) was contained in a Cabinet selfextractor (be207941ce8a5e212be8dde83d05d38d), served from the following URL:
http://login.radio-m[.]cf/utc/dnld.exe
The process tree below shows dnld.exe drops sami.exe (DownPaper), which in turn runs Powershell to gain
persistency:

DownPaper performs the following steps:
1. Loads from a resource file a URL of a command and control server. In the sample we
analyzed, the URL was “http://46.17.97[.]37/downloader/poster.php”, Base64 encoded as
can be seen below:

2. Searches and reads the value of Window Update registry key in the following path:
HKCU:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run.
a. If the value is Null, a new mutex is created, called Global\UpdateCenter, and a mutex
synchronization function is executed.
b. If the value is different than the name of the running file, section 2.a. is executed and a
function called SetStartUp is called via PowerShell to create a registry key named
Window Update with the following value:

$scriptRoot\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\wuauclt.exe

3. Sends an HTTP POST request to get the location of a second stage from the command and control
server. The requests contain the following fields:
a. Infected computer host name
b. Username
c. Serial Number – Retrieved via the following query: SELECT * FROM Win32_BaseBoard
4. When a file is received, runs it in a new thread.
5. Pause for ten seconds, then repeat step 3.

MAGICHOUND.RETRIEVER
By pivoting off the malicious infrastructure we found a sample of MAGICHOUND.RETRIEVER, a malware
which is covered in a report by Palo Alto Networks about a group they call Magic Hound37. The report says
that Magic Hound “has primarily targeted organizations in the energy, government, and technology sectors
that are either based or have business interests in Saudi Arabia”. Also, “Link analysis of infrastructure and
tools […] revealed a potential relationship between Magic Hound and the adversary group called ‘Rocket
Kitten’”. The last notion is in line with our findings.
MAGICHOUND.RETRIEVER is a .NET downloader that retrieves secondary payloads using an embedded URL
in its configuration as the C2. Below is the sample that we found.
