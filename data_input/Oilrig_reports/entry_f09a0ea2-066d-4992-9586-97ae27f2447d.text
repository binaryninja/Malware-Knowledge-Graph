yber threats no longer
have borders and we
are now facing increasingly organized and international groups. The networks of
attackers have professionalized
and today target government
organizations such as large
companies or even the smallest
ones.
In recent years, recent health
and geopolitical crises have further increased the tensions of
the Cyber World and we now observe attacks targeting all sectors of activity whether for lucrative purpose as ransomware
attacks, espionage or even, data
theft.
The first weapon in the face of
this threat is to be able to understand our opponents, their
techniques, tactics and procedures of attackers in order to
ensure to protect the critical assets of our clients and government partners.
As the European leader in cyber security and the worldwide
leader in data protection, Thales
addresses the entire information security lifecycle, the cornerstone of digital trust. Thales
helps secure the digital trans-

formation of the most demanding government bodies, private
firms and critical infrastructure
providers.
Capitalising on our teams worldwide, with more than 11 consultancy teams and 6 Security
Operation Centres, we can leverage our international threats
expertise to ensure cyber protection to our customers from
space to the ground and from
information systems to operational technologies.
Our Cyber Threat Intelligence
expert team is screening on a
daily basis a rich database and
multiple cyber threat sources
around the world, which we
have been monitoring for several decades in order to ensure
actionable strategies for critical
companies or governments. It
relies among other things, on
collaboration and transparency
between organizations to ensure
the right sharing of information.
Today, we want to provide as
many expertise and solutions as
possible for a cybersecurity that
only makes sense if it is collective. It is with this objective that
we wanted to broaden the scope
of our Cyber Threat Atlas named “Cyber threat Hitmap” and
provide it, for the first time, in
a digital format opened to everyone.
Our Thales Cyber Threat Atlas
will open-source to everyone a
detailed knowledge of the cyber
threat ecosystem by contextualizing the activity of attacker
groups.
For this, we have selected a
sample of 50 preliminary attac-

ker groups that we believe are
particularly important in today’s
cyber threat landscape. The
knowledge of these attackers,
their nature, their motivations,
their tools and their operating
methods served as a basis for
the construction of this Atlas.
This work, which comes from
both geographical and sectoral angles, offers several complementary reading grids. Our
analysis shows a breakdown
into fourteen sectors of activity, allying the most traditional
sectors (transportation, energy,
education and research, telecommunications, health, government, legal, finance, manufacturing, retail) to innovative
industries (automotive, space,
maritime, aviation) which by the
strategic nature of their activity are of interest to advanced
threat actors.
Thales uses directly this information to feed its Cybels offer
of tools and services and provide high added value actions to
ensure a better protection for
everyone.
Understanding the geostrategic
frameworks as well as main targeted sectors threats is key to
the relevance of Cyber detection
and protection. Combined, they
provide much better understanding state of the threat.
I am sure that you will be able
to make good use of this book
for your detection and protection needs and I wish you a good
read and regular browsing on

Contextual analysis of Europe and geocyber risks
Europe today is an incredibly
complex geopolitical space —
the result of centuries of history marked by a constant oscillation between strife and union.
It is composed of over 40 different countries and cultures
with a great diversity of national and regional languages.
Geographically, Europe comprises a highly developed Western Europe, which has long
been open to globalisation and
its Atlantic interface; a Sou-

thern Europe with a Mediterranean culture and outlook;
an Eastern Europe observing
Western Europe on one side
and Russia on the other; and
a Northern Europe around the
Baltic. Modern Europe continues to reflect this history and
geography.
Despite these geostrategic and
cultural differences, a European
cooperation has been built
around the European Union,
the euro zone1 and bilateral

and/or multilateral agreements.
The European continent is a
privileged territory for the development of cyber threats: the
size of the attack surface (governmental structures, enterprises) provides opportunities
for cybercriminals, and different
motivations can come into play,
as Europe is both the cradle of
companies willing to pay ransoms and a powerful symbol of
the western world - justifying
ideology-based attacks.

_TERRITORY AND IDENTITY:
THE RISK OF CYBER DESTABILISATION

One of the greatest geocyber risks that Europe faces is
destabilisation. The purpose
of Europe as a combined entity is to be unified in order to
ensure a shared development
and a place on the international stage. This can lead to
attempts to weaken it from
abroad. One striking example
is Brexit, which has marked a
profound geopolitical reconfiguration in Europe. This shift
has been exploited by threat
actors to weaken political entities such as the European
Union and the United Kingdom itself.

Fake Brexit-related document containing the Zebrocy malware were sent
to multiple specific targets, enabling
ATK5 to break into the computer
networks of European government
agencies. Most importantly, this attack displays the ability of attacker
groups to leverage sensitive political
issues and turn them into potential
attack vectors. Zebrocy acted as a
first-stage backdoor and was used
to perform system reconnaissance,
create or modify files, execute commands, take screenshots and create
Windows scheduled tasks2.

_BREXIT EXPLOITED AS A
WAY TO TARGET GOVERNMENT AGENCIES IN THE UK
AND WESTERN EUROPE

_PLAYING ON THE WEST’S
FEARS: THE EXAMPLE OF
THE ATTACK ON TV5MONDE

In 2018, the ATK5 (APT28, Sofacy) group, known for its involvement on the 2016 U.S presidential
election campaign and its allegedly close ties to Russian intelligence, conducted a phishing scheme targeting Western Europe and
the United Kingdom in particular.

Some attacks also take advantage
of internal crisis in certain countries
to destabilise public opinion. On 8
April 2015, a hacker group took
control of the TV5Monde website
and its social media accounts and
caused television programmes to be
interrupted for several hours. We

12

now know that this attack was carried out by ATK5 (APT28), although
it has not been directly attributed to
the group. A hacker group calling itself the Cyber Caliphate, linked to
so-called Islamic State, first claimed
responsibility. To shed light on the
attack and identify the real perpetrators, TV5Monde called in technical
experts from ANSSI, France’s national agency for information system
security, who restored service and
conducted a forensic investigation
to search for clues. As their investigation progressed, suspicions began to point to ATK5 (APT28). The
evidence gathered by the experts
looked similar to a modus operandi
already used by the group. As reflected in this attack, it should be noted
that groups such as ATK5 (APT28)
use visceral issues of contention
between or within European countries to destabilise and weaken
them3. Interestingly enough, the
main destabilising agent is not
the attacks itself but rather its erroneous attribution to an entity

close to ISIS, creating an alliance of
circumstance between an ideological opponent wishing to undermine
European influence and a civilizational adversary who uses the claim to
instil fear within the population.

_TERRITORY AND DEVELOPMENT: CYBERCRIME RISK
AND INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE

Europe has many large corporations and SMEs (Small
to medium-sized enterprises)
that are interdependent at
continental level. They are
also part of the global economy. This European financial, industrial and innovation
ecosystem inevitably attracts
the attention of large cybercriminal groups as well as
actors motivated by industrial espionage.
_THE ERA OF CYBER-EXTORTION AND THE RISK OF GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS

_AIRBUS VICTIM OF INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE AND THE
RISK OF GLOBAL ATTACKS
VIA THE SUPPLY CHAIN

On 30 January 2020, French contractor Bouygues Construction was the
victim of an attack claimed by the
group of attackers behind the Maze
ransomware4.
The operators demanded a ransom of €10 million from
the French group in exchange for a
decryption key and the guarantee that
its sensitive data would not be leaked.
On 21 October 2020, Sopra Steria
announced that it had fallen victim
to the Ryuk ransomware5. A month
later, in November 2020, Italy-based
international energy group Enel announced that it had become the victim of the Netwalker ransomware and
that its operators were demanding a
payment of some €14 million6. Most
European companies are closely integrated into the market economy and
are therefore especially vulnerable
to supply chain attacks. During the
REvil ransomware attack on IT management software company Kaseya
in July 2021, over 1,000 other organizations were impacted, mostly in
Europe7. Swedish supermarket franchise Coop had to close 800 stores
because they were unable to use their
cash registers8. This supply chain attack culminated in a record ransom
demand of $70 million in return for a
universal decryption key.

Supply chain attacks on European
industrial or financial groups are not
only motivated by financial gain but
also by technological catch-up. As a
result, industrial espionage against
major European corporations is now
a significant threat. In 2019, Airbus
was hit by a supply chain attack designed to steal information about the
A350 airliner and the A400M military transport plane9. The attack was
initially attributed to the Chinese
hacker group ATK41 (APT10), then
to the ATK146 group (Avivore)10. It
should be noted that it is difficult to
determine the exact origin of this
attack, mainly because Chinese espionage groups tend to share their
infrastructure and attack tools. This
sophisticated attack demonstrated
the strategic adaptability of certain
groups and the advanced threat
posed by supply chain attacks. For
the attackers, the impossibility of a
frontal attack on the Airbus group
was circumvented by compromising
suppliers of the aircraft manufacturer such as Rolls-Royce or Expleo,
laying the ground for actors with basic capabilities to attack high value
targets11.

_TERRITORIES AND POLITICAL MODELS: RISK OF
STRATEGIC INCIDENTS OF
STRATEGIC INCIDENTS

Europe, as we explained earlier, is a geopolitical space
with a diverse array of identities, territories, political
orientations and societies,
which can lead to conflicts.
_AREAS OF INSTABILITY
UKRAINE
On the edge of Europe, in Ukraine,
an armed conflict between Ukrainian government forces and Russian separatist militias has been
ongoing since 2014. It is the result
of the annexation of Crimea by Russia, which provoked an open war in
eastern Ukraine. In 2014 and 2015,
Germany, France, Ukraine and Russia ratified two different versions of
the Minsk agreements to settle the
conflict and end the fighting in the
industrialized regions of Donetsk
and Luhansk. These agreements
were never implemented and the
conflict was prolonged, taking the
form of a trench war along the
front line. The conflict has escalated in December 2021 with Russia moving troops near the border,
making western governments fear
a military attack of Ukraine12.

itself, the European Union is trying
to bring political stability through

influence in the region, which can
exacerbate geopolitical destabilisation and lead to cyberattacks.

_CYBERATTACKS AGAINST
UKRAINE AMID TENSIONS
WITH RUSSIA
The
ongoing
armed
conflict
between the Ukrainian military and
pro-Russian troops has sparked an
intense cyber activity in the region,
targeting especially the Ukrainian
territory.
The ATK14 hacker group (BlackEnergy) has long been known for
targeting companies in Europe’s
energy sector. Starting in early
2015, the group infiltrated a large
number of Ukrainian electricity distribution companies in order to install the BlackEnergy malware and
access their OT/SCADA infrastructure. On 23 December 2015, hackers successfully compromised the
SCADA systems of three Ukrainian energy companies and shut
down their substations. They used
the KillDisk plugin to destroy files
on workstations. The group also
launched a more conventional
DDoS attack on the call centres of
the three companies to make them
unavailable to customers. The attack left about 230,000 people without power for nearly six hours in
the Ivano-Frankivsk, Chernivtsi and
14

Kiev oblasts (regions). This attack
is one of the first cases of cyber sabotage directed at a power grid and
demonstrates the determination
and skill of the attackers. It is still
not known whether the malware
caused the power outage, or simply
allowed its operators to do it manually.
On June 2017, a major cyberattack hit Ukrainian companies. The
malware used is a new version of
Petya, a family of ransomware uncovered in 2016, which had been infecting Windows-based systems. This
attack dubbed NotPetya, initially
targeting Ukrainian infrastructures
spread globally and is still considered as one of the most destructive
cyberattack ever achieved. The attackers leveraged the EternalBlue
vulnerability and used unpatched
computers to propagate across entire networks. The UK government,
through its National Cyber Security
Centre asserted with a high degree
of confidence that the Russian military had carried out the NotPetya
cyberattack, whose objective was to
disrupt energy companies and government institutions in Ukraine13.
The estimated cost for the global
economy reaches 10 billion dollars.

On the night of January 13-14,
2022, a cyberattack named “Operation Bleeding Bear” affected several Ukrainian government sites,
rendering the computer structure
of state-owned sites temporarily
inoperable. This low-complexity attack consisted of the defacement
of the targeted sites with the replacement of the homepage with a
propaganda message in Ukrainian.
It seems that the attacker exploited
a known vulnerability in a content
management system (CMS). Besides, a dozen of systems (Windows
and Linux) were also destroyed by
a wiper malware. This attack comes in a context of escalating tensions due to the failure of negotiations and the massive presence of
pro-Russian forces stationed at the
border. If Ukraine points the finger
at the group of hackers known as
UNC1151, affiliated with the Belarusian secret service, the low level of
technicality of the attacker opens
up a wide range of possibilities in
terms of its origin, from individual
hackers to state-sponsored groups.
This attack is indicative of the use
of non-traditional fields including
cyber in the pursuit of political objectives. In this case, the destabili-

BALTIC STATES
The Baltic states are a region where
the homogenisation four dimensions — identity, society, politics
and territory — is proving difficult.
These countries, which declared
independence in 1990 after the
collapse of the Soviet Union, quickly sought to distance themselves
from Russia’s sphere of influence
by refusing to be integrated into
the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS) and instead joining the
EU and NATO in 2004. Since the
2016 Warsaw Summit., they have
benefited from NATO airspace and
on the ground protection. While the
region may seem well protected, it
remains surrounded by Russian influence to the east and south (Kaliningrad enclave and Russian forces
in Belarus) and lies in part alongside

Russia’s access route to the Baltic
Sea. It should also be noted that
there are significant Russian minorities in these countries (26.5% in
Estonia, 26% in Latvia and 5.8% in
Lithuania)15.
_MASSIVE CYBERATTACKS IN
ESTONIA
In April 2007, dozens of Estonian
organisations — Parliament, banks,
government ministries, newspapers,
etc. — were simultaneously targeted
by a DDoS attack. In this large-scale
campaign, one of the malwares used
was none other than BlackEnergy
from the ATK14 group (BlackEnergy).
As a result of these significant and
destructive attacks, NATO decided
to set up its Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, which is
based in Estonia.
_A POWER SPACE AT RISK
FROM STRATEGIC ESPIONAGE
In addition to these attacks, which
are exceptional in terms of their
consequences, European countries
are regularly under threat from
strategic espionage campaigns by
foreign groups.
CONTINUOUS ESPIONAGE
In November 2019, ANSSI, France’s
national agency for information system security, reported cyberattacks
against service providers and design
offices. The hackers used the PlugX
malware to infiltrate their systems,
steal data and, almost certainly, access the networks of their clients. In
July 2021, it was discovered that the
Pegasus spyware was being used
on a massive scale — a reminder
of the strategic nature of certain

types of cyberattacks. More recently, in September 2021, the German
authorities announced that German
politicians had been spied on in the
run-up to the federal elections by
the Ghostwriter gang, an APT group
known for its alleged close ties with
Russian military service GRU. This
is not the first time Germany has
been at the center of an espionage-motivated attack campaign,
as between 2017 and 2018 its government agencies were reportedly
targeted by ATK56 (APT28), another group linked to Russia. During
this incident, the hackers managed
to gain access to the network of
several German ministries (foreign
affairs, defence) as well as the German’s Chancellery and the Federal
Court of Auditors. German interests are also closely scrutinized by
other countries, most notably Iran
and China. The activity of Iranian
attack groups on German targets
has intensified recently with the
rise of tensions in the Gulf and the
maintenance of financial sanctions.
A report by the Dutch intelligence
services even pointed to the Iranian
strategy of using cyber espionage
as a tool in the quest to acquire
European military technology. This
strategy even extends to the political domain with the surveillance
of its expatriate population in the
Netherlands and the monitoring of
the criticism addressed to the Iranian regime16.

Conclusion
As we have seen, Europe is
a complex geopolitical space
where multiple spheres of
power and various models are
at play, chief among them the
European Union, NATO and
Russia.
These
models
sometimes
clash, leading to crises that are
conducive to the emergence of
cyberthreats — as in Ukraine,

the Baltic countries and the
Western Balkans.
Europe is the product of permanent oscillation between unity
and plurality of identities, with
political aspirations that can
provoke societal, economic, political and territorial crises, and
that can be utilised as levers of
destabilisation by cyberattacker
groups.

Europe is also highly integrated
into the globalisation process,
with industrial and financial
champions, but also thanks to
a myriad of SMEs, which are
permanent targets of organised
cybercrime and even industrial
espionage.

Contextual analysis of CIS and geocyber risks
On 8 December 1991, just before the USSR officially collapsed, Russia, Ukraine and
Belarus signed the Minsk
Treaty. This treaty established
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which
was intended to guarantee a
form of multilateral consistency between the former Soviet
republics, despite the overall disintegration.

On 21 December, Armenia,
Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Moldova and Tajikistan
joined the CIS. Two years later, in 1993, Georgia joined the
group. It should be noted that
the Baltic States, former soviet
socialist republics, never joined
the CIS.
This organisation, built on the
historic foundations of the Eas-

tern Bloc, is made up of a set of
complex, intertwined dynamics,
a Soviet Union centred on Moscow and the influences of new
powers in a multipolar world.
This confrontation leads to the
emergence of regional tensions
that justify the use of cyber as a
vector of influence.

_CAUCASUS: A STRATEGIC
CROSSROADS

_SEPARATISM, NATIONALISM
AND JIHADISM IN GEORGIA

The Caucasus is a strategic zone
in several respects. First, geographically, it serves as a buffer zone
between two continents: Europe
and Asia. North of the Greater
Caucasus mountain range, on
the Georgian and Azerbaijani borders, lies Russia, the former heart
of the Soviet Union. To the south is Turkey, with its Sunni nationalist culture, and Iran, which
has a Shiite Islamic culture. The
three countries are geographically
intertwined and bordered to the
east by the Caspian Sea and the
west by the Black Sea.
This particular geography and topography makes the Caucasus a
narrow corridor and a crossroads
of cultures and identities. This
crossroads is also strategic and
lead certain nearby powers —
such as the European Union (with
NATO), Turkey, Iran and Russia
— to assert their influence in the
region

After the fall of the USSR, many internal conflicts broke out. In Georgia, a civil war (1991-1993) pitted
the secessionist provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia against
the central government in Tbilisi1.
Geographically,
the
Caucasus
extends into Russian territory,
with the North Caucasus. It was in
the North Caucasus that the First
Chechen War erupted in 1994.
This conflict — as in Abkhazia and
South Ossetia — was the scene
of confrontation between independence movements and a former
Soviet republic, in this case Russia.

by popular, peaceful demonstrations, these revolutions highlight
the confrontation between Western influence and Russia’s desire
to control its near abroad. The democratic aspirations of the people
and the spectre of the emergence
of pro-Western civil societies in
the region motivate Russian interference, particularly through disinformation campaigns as a part of a
more global hybrid warfare strategy.

18

The regional consequences of the
Russo-Chechen conflicts are significant and make terrorism even
more entrenched. For example, the
Pankisi Gorge crisis from 2002
to 2003 saw Georgia clash with
Chechen rebels and members of
Al-Qaeda.
The 2000’s were also marked by
the appearance of colour revolutions in former Soviet republics,
in Georgia in 2003 (Rose Revolution), in Ukraine in 2004 (Orange
Revolution) and in Belarus in 2005
(Jeans Revolution). Characterized

In 2008, a war broke out between
Georgia and South Ossetia, supported by Russia, Abkhazia and the
CIS armed forces. This conflict,
which Georgia lost, allowed to leave
the CIS. This conflict signals the
resurgence of Moscow’s influence,
which is posing as the protector of
secessions.
In 2007 and 2008, around the time
of the Russo-Georgian War and the
widespread attacks in Estonia, the
ATK5 group (APT28) really began
to structure its attack campaigns.
From 2007 to 2014, ATK5 (APT28)
massively targeted Georgian government agencies, including the
Ministry of the Interior and Ministry
of Defence, as well as civilians. The
ATK14 group (BlackEnergy) also
launched massive DDoS attacks

against Georgia and later began to
target Estonia as well. The source
code of the malware was sold at that
time, which increased the number
of attacks on Georgia. From 2011 to
2013, another ATK14 malware called
Potao was used to target Armenia
and Georgia. In late 2013, it began to
be deployed in Ukraine, with several
samples used to target this country.
From September 2014, the victims
of this malware included Ukrainian
government agencies and the armed
forces.
In spring 2010, the ATK7 group
(APT10) conducted actions across
the entire Caucasus and Central
Asia, with continued campaigns
using PinchDuke against Turkey and
Georgia as well as numerous campaigns against other members of
the Commonwealth of Independent
States, such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan.
This same malware was identified
in Chechnya in 2008. In 2015, ATK7
(APT29) also targeted Georgian entities with the CosmicDuke malware
and a file attachment with a name
in Georgian that translates “NATO
consolidates control of Black Sea.
docx”.

paign. Threat actors also conducted attacks against Armenian targets using Zero Days via Chrome
and Internet Explorer. Azerbaijan
was targeted by the ATK178 and
ATK228 groups and the PoetRAT
malware. The targets were highly
specific and appeared to be mainly Azerbaijani public and private
sector organisations, especially
ICS (Import Control System) and
SCADA (Supervisory Control and
Data Acquisition) systems in the
energy sector. The number and
variety of tools they used indicate
that the attacks were carefully
planned. The ATK228 group’s main
objective was to compromise the
wind power companies that produce Azerbaijan’s electricity. On 5
August 2020, ATK5 (APT28) also
launched an attack campaign using
the Zebrocy malware against several NATO member governments,
Middle Eastern governments and
the Azerbaijan government, which
cooperates with NATO. This attack
campaign came just days after the
clashes between Azerbaijan and
Armenia and less than two months before the conflict began on 27
September.

_CONFLICT BETWEEN ARMENIA AND AZERBAIJAN LINKED
TO THE QUESTION OF NAGORNO-KARABAKH
The path to the independence of
Armenia from Azerbaijan was made
in the throes of a war (1988-1994)
between these two former Soviet
republics. In 2020, a second war
broke out between Nagorno-Karabakh, supported by Armenia,
and Azerbaijan and the Syrian National Army, backed by Turkey. In
November 2020, a ceasefire was
jointly announced by the belligerents. Azerbaijan regained possession of the Agdam, Kalbajar and
Lachin districts. Tensions are still
extremely high in the region and
animosity between Armenia and
Azerbaijan remains significant.
The 2020 conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh was also the theatre of a
lot of cyber activity. The ATK116
group (Inception, Cloud Atlas) was
active in October and November
2020 with an espionage campaign
based on use of an article entitled:
“Armenia transfers YPG/PKK terrorists to occupied area to train
militias against Azerbaijan”. Both
sides were targeted in this cam-

ahead. An extensive network of
transport, pipeline and telecommunication infrastructure will form
the physical skeleton of a future
Eurasian “economic corridor”. This
network will link China to Western
Europe by land via Central Asia,
Asia Minor, the Persian Gulf, the
Caucasus and the Balkans. It will
also link them by sea via the South
China Sea, the Indian Ocean and
the Persian Gulf through to the
Mediterranean.
The $50 billion Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and
the $40 billion Silk Road Fund were
set up by Xi Jinping to inject investment into regional infrastructure.
Despite the altruistic rhetoric, Beijing is responding to national priorities and serving primarily Chinese
economic, political and strategic
interests. While based on the historic aura of the ancient road that
linked the Chinese and Roman empires, the objectives of these “new
silk roads” are adapted to serve
contemporary geopolitical needs.
Central Asia is a key part of the original New Silk Roads project, which
aimed to promote the construction
of transport infrastructure between
China and Europe. Xi Jinping’s
speech announcing the launch of
the Silk Road Economic Belt was
made in Astana (renamed Nur-Sultan on 23 March 2019), Kazakhstan.
The imagery of the Silk Roads is
especially resonant in this part of
the world, which was at the heart
of the trade flows between Europe,
the Middle East and the Chinese
Empire prior to the 15th century. Of
the six “economic corridors” in the
new Belt and Road Initiative (BRI),
two directly concern Central Asia:
the New Eurasian Land Bridge
(China, Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus, Poland, Germany) and the China-Central Asia-West Asia Economic Corridor (China, Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan,
Turkmenistan, Iran, Turkey).
In spite of having become the first
trading partner for central Asia
countries, China’s interest in its
neighbouring region to the west is
not only based on an economic vision. For the Chinese central government, helping stabilise and develop the countries on its western
front is a way to avoid instability at
the gates of its western Xinjiang region. This region, considered unstable by Beijing, is mainly populated
by ethnic Uyghurs2. Security coo20

peration between China and Central Asia is largely centred around
the Uyghur question and the fight
against the “three scourges” identified by the Shanghai Cooperation
Organisation (SCO): terrorism, separatism and religious extremism.
In the years ahead, Russia’s reactions to China’s growing presence
in its historic area of influence
will be closely watched. For Russia, the BRI certainly comes with
advantages, such as investment
capacities that it cannot offer its
partners and that will help improve
infrastructures and make trade
within the EAEU more seamless.
Launched in 2015, it does not
challenge Russia’s monopoly on
political-security issues in Central
Asia — at least for now — and it
supports institutional recognition
of the EAEU as a credible and legitimate regional organisation3.
Nonetheless, China’s security presence could be strengthened in the
medium or long term with the expansion of Chinese economic interests in the zone, as can be seen in
Tajikistan4.

_LOOKING AT THE MAJOR
ATTACKERS WHO HAVE TARGETED THE REGION, WE
QUICKLY SEE THAT THE GEOPOLITICAL CONTEXT HAS A
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE
NATURE AND STRUCTURE OF
THE CYBERTHREAT.
The cyber continuity of the Chinese
Silk Road initiative is rendered essential by the need to secure sea and
land routes. Among the 360 cyberattack campaigns observed since the
birth of the project, one can notice
the presence of high-intensity actors
with allegedly close ties to Chinese
authorities. The ATK15 (Emissary
Panda) group launched campaigns
between fall 2017 and March 2018
targeting a Central Asian data center. The use of a compromised router
(RouterOS Mikrokit) allowed the attacker group to access government
resources. While the beginnings of
ATK 15 date back to 2009, its recent
activity reflects China’s need to secure land and sea routes to Europe.
Nevertheless, while Central Asian
countries and Russia seem relatively
unaffected by the massive and repeated attacks that other countries
in the region (India in particular)
may suffer, several indicators tend
to show a reversal of this logic with
the spectre of direct attacks on
strategic infrastructures in Central
Asia or Russia.
Other active hackers in the region
such as ATK23 (Icefog) and ATK147
(Poison Carp) have targeted Uyghur
and Tibetan minorities in particular.

Conclusion
We have observed that the
countries of the Commonwealth
of Independent States, which
were formerly Soviet republics5,
share two main characteristics.
First, they have a high risk of
internal instability (within each
country and across the broader regions), notably due to the
emergence of separatist movements in the Caucasus.
In addition, they are strate-

gically
important,
because
their geographic location fuel
the geopolitical appetites of
neighbouring powers. The Caucasus is an interface between
Continental Europe and East
Asia. Central Asia, the heart of
Eurasia, is at the crossroads of
Russian, Chinese, Iranian and
Western (NATO) influences.
This second feature, shared by
the two zones and their res-

pective countries, is leading the
world’s major powers to project their influence on these
territories, even if it means taking advantage of or stirring up
potential internally destabilising
factors

increase in the median age by just
over five years, coupled with the
increase in per capita living standards by 2050, will also lead to a
diversification and increase in the
use of digital media.
Inevitably, the higher Internet penetration rate will spell an upsurge
in the number of interconnections
and, as a result, a greater vulnerability and threat surface.
The implication in terms of cyberthreats is directly apparent, but it

_INTERNET PENETRATION
To understand the cyberthreat in
Africa, one of the most significant
contextual trends is the exponential
growth of Internet penetration in
the various countries.
From 2000 to 2021, the African
population increased by almost
68%, from 817.67 million in 2000
to 1,373.49 million in 2021. Over
the same period, the number of
Internet users rose from 4.51 million to 590.3 million, an increase of
12,988.7% 1,2,3,4,5.
In 2021, Internet penetration in
Africa extended to 43% of the population, or almost one in two people.
This figure is 78 times higher than
20 years ago. Africa today is modern and connected.

This dual dynamic of a rapidly expanding vulnerability

impact on the level of cyberthreat observed across the
African continent.

_OPPORTUNITIES AND
CHALLENGES

The contextual issue for understanding the cyberthreat
in Africa is not simply the exponential increase in digital
technology across the continent. In reality, the problem
also lies in the imbalance
between this increase and
the status of cybersecurity
and cyberdefence in the societies concerned.
_LACK OF CYBER EXPERTS
This imbalance is mainly due to
three co-constituent factors. First,
it is a human problem, which
does not only concern the African
continent. In Africa, an additional 100,000 cybersecurity experts
are needed in order to respond to
the current challenges15. And the
trends we have discussed will further increase this need.

_POOR VISIBILITY OF THE
NUMBER OF SECURITY INCIDENTS
There is also a cultural issue in cybersecurity in terms of reporting
and fixing security incidents. Some
96%16 of incidents are not reported
or resolved, which means that the
level of cyberthreat in Africa is likely
to be much higher than we know.
_LEGAL AND STRATEGIC ARMOURY UNDER CONSTRUCTION
Most African countries have not
yet, or have not sufficiently, structured their legal armoury to deal
with the cyberthreat. In 2016, it was
estimated that over 40 countries
across the entire continent had not
or had only partially implemented
specific legal provisions to address
the challenges of cybercrime and
oversee the gathering of electronic
evidence17. It should also be noted
that only 15 African countries have
a national cybersecurity strategy in
place18.

Conclusion
Africa is destined to become
one of the geographic parts of
the world where the cyber issue will be the most decisive
factor for the future of societies and organisations.
Already, the continent’s colossal trends are fuelling a strategically important yet unsuspected cyberthreat. These trends
include the exponentially increasing Internet penetration
across society and industry (up
12,988.7% in 20 years), the de-

mographic structure of these
societies (1.2 billion people under 25 by 2050) and the rapidly
growing popularity of digital
tools.
At the same time, 96% of security incidents are unknown
or unreported and decisive attacks are already affecting the
continent, as we have seen in
Ethiopia, South Africa and Liberia.
These trends will obviously
continue to create huge issues

and challenges, yet a mismatch
is already apparent when we
consider the structure of cybersecurity and cyberdefence
across the continent. Three
challenges need to be met, namely the training of the population to create cyber experts,
the visibility of incidents and a
clearly defined legal and strategic framework to address the
cyberthreat.

_EXAMPLE OF SOUTH AFRICA
IN 2019
In July 2019, the City of Johannesburg fell victim to a devastating ransomware attack12. The operators of
the malware, the Shadow Kill Hackers, targeted City Power, the city’s
main power company, forcing the
authorities to shut down the city’s
website, e-services platform and billing system13. Electricity was also cut
off for several hours in the city.

_US FOREIGN POLICY HAVE
HAD SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES ON THE CYBERTHREAT LANDSCAPE.

Contextual analysis of North America and geocyber risks
The Americas can be divided
into three geographic regions:
North America, which includes
the United States, Canada and
Mexico; Central America; and
South America. This hemisphere is marked by its cultural
contrasts and, in particular, by
its economic diversity.
The United States and Canada
are rich and developed, while
other countries in the region
are considered to be emergent
or low-income economies. The
Americas are beset by many
geopolitical
tensions
taking
the form of border conflicts

between countries or even social conflicts within them. The
role of the United States, sometimes described as dominant, is
often cited as the cause.
More accurately, dominance on
the continent can be described
as being shared between the
United States and Canada, the
region’s two most developed
nations. This creates a geoeconomic contrast on the continent as a whole, as these two
countries constitute one of the
three major poles of the world
economy. Indeed, in 2015, the
GDP of the United States was

$18,036 billion, the highest in
the world. Canada’s was $1,550
billion, placing it in tenth. These
countries have diversified economies that are extremely
well-integrated into global trade.
The United States is home to
many of the largest multinational corporations and several
global cities, chief among which
is New York.
However, such disparities and
issues of hegemony can exacerbate international tensions,
fostering an environment of
heightened geopolitical cyberthreats.

_ONGOING INTERNATIONAL
TENSIONS IN NORTH AMERICA

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and
Mexican President Enrique Peña
Nieto have frequently remarked on
their disagreements with President
Trump, while remaining clear that
they wish to continue their cooperation with the world’s leading economy.
During his term, President Trump
oriented its foreign policy towards a strengthening of bilateral relationships with Russia, Iran, and
even China.

nefits from the hostility that exists
between the two countries. However, the US hardly revels in the
ongoing tensions, and does not appear to profit from them, not least
because as Russia grows more distant from other European countries
and US, it is becoming increasingly
dependent on its relations with
China and less inclined towards mitigating the increasing asymmetry
between these powers.

Since the end of the Second
World War – and, more to the
point, since the Bretton Woods
agreement in 1944 – the United
States has remained at the top of
the international order.
_THE US AND CHANGING FOREIGN POLICIES IN THE ERA
OF “AMERICA FIRST”
Canada, Mexico and the rest of
the world have had to significantly
amend their foreign policies over
the last several years, under
pressure during Donald Trump’s
term as President of the United
States from 2017 to 2021.

RUSSIA–US RELATIONS
The power balance between the
United States and these three nations was a touchstone of Trump’s
tenure, and continues to be so under Biden, albeit with less emphasis on Russia.
On Russia specifically, some observers of Russia–US relations, particularly pro-Kremlin Europeans,
have claimed that Vladimir Putin
is an “ideal” or “useful” enemy for
America. They imply that the US
is almost entirely responsible for
its tense, fragile relationship with
Putin’s Russia, or even that it be-

IRAN–US RELATIONS
Relations between the US and Iran
have become yet more precarious.
Indeed, the recent spike in tensions
starting in early 2019 is part of a
broader trend of escalating diplomatic disagreements between the
two countries. Already fraught after
the US’s withdrawal from the Iran
nuclear deal (JCPOA) in May 2018,
Iran–US relations have degraded
even further, especially since the
Trump administration added the
Revolutionary Guards to its list of
terrorist organisations in April 2019
and tightened its sanctions against
Tehran the following month. In

2020, relations between these two
countries were aggravated yet further with the killing of the Iranian
General Qassem Soleimani, the Islamic Republic’s representative in
Iraq and head of the Quds Force, in
an American raid in Baghdad on 3
January 2020. Despite an Iranian
retaliation in the form of several
missile strikes on US bases in Iraq,
tensions have begun to soften as
the two sides seek some level of
stability.
CHINA–US RELATIONS
In recent years, relations between
China and the United States have
been beset by several geopolitical
events that have strained the limits of diplomacy between the two
countries.
For example, in 2020, the US accused China at length of data theft
and widespread espionage, leading to the closure of the Chinese
consulate in Houston, Texas. The
US Secretary of State justified
these steps as being for the protection of US intellectual property
and the personal information of individual Americans. Mike Pompeo

also described the Chinese consulate in Houston as having been a
hub for espionage. Moreover, two
Chinese nationals were charged by
a US court with computer hacking
offences for allegedly stealing data
from a company working on a Covid-19 vaccine.
However, the closure of the
Houston consulate in particular
was all the more symbolic as it
was the PRC’s first in the United
States, having opened in 1979 with
the reestablishment of diplomatic
relations between the two powers.
China viewed the closure as a step
too far, declaring it an outrageous,
unjustified and unilateral provocation by the US. Beijing retaliated
by ordering the closure of the US
consulate in Chengdu, in central
China, on 24 July 2020. In a press
release, the Chinese foreign minister described this as a “legitimate
and necessary response to the
unreasonable measures taken by
the United States”.

The threat represented by Russia
has been compounded by a marked
increase in the number and severity of attacks since 2019. In cyberespionage, the SolarWinds attack
(December 2020) demonstrated
the danger posed by attacks from
state-sponsored groups. This supply chain breach had a particularly serious impact because, rather
than directly targeting the federal
government or a private company’s
network, the perpetrators attacked a
third-party software supplier serving
these entities. The target was an IT
management platform called Orion,
a product of Texas-based company
SolarWinds. More than 33,000 businesses used Orion. According to
SolarWinds, 18,000 of its clients
were affected, including 425 Fortune
500 companies.
This heightened threat is also exemplified by the ransomware attack
conducted by ATK168 using REvil,
also known as Sodinokibi. The attack on software company Kaseya
by the REvil ransomware operation
is considered the largest ever such
attack by a cybercriminal group.
While 2017’s three ransomware attacks (WannaCry, NotPetya and Bad
Rabbit) were larger, they were linked to state-sponsored actors rather
than groups with financial motives.
According to cybersecurity researchers at Symantec, some vague indications point to political motives
behind the attack. The US has not
explicitly linked the REvil attacks to
the Kremlin, but President Joe Biden has nevertheless warned his
Russian counterpart that the latter’s
government must act against such
criminal organisations, and that US
authorities would do so if necessary.
In January 2021, several members of
REvil were arrested by Russian authorities obeying to a US demand.
While it may appear as the reinforcement of collaboration between
the two countries, the timing of this
announcement raises questions as

were targeted by a cyberattack and
Russian troops are massed at the
border.
Likewise, the largest oil pipeline of
the US, Colonial Pipeline, fell victim to the RaaS (Ransomware-asa-Service), forcing the company to
temporarily shut down its activity.
The incident, which happened on
May 7, 2021, affected the delivery of
gas in Southern states, provoking
shortages at gas pumps.
Former US President Donald Trump
was also the target of several influence campaigns. These attacks
appeared to originate from groups
operating in China, including ATK213
(also known as APT31). This group
carried out more than 150 breaches
over the course of six months. In
2020, Trump called for the social
media platform Tik Tok to be banned
in the United States, on the basis
that the data collected through the
app was disseminated to the Chinese
government. This ban provoked
many Chinese actors to carry out
influence campaigns aimed at destabilising the US elections by sowing
disinformation about the President
to sway voters.

32

_THREATS ARE ALSO EMERGING FROM OUTSIDE OF
CHINA.
After months of heightened tensions between the US and Iran,
there were fears that this could have
been used as justification for an
attempt to destabilise the US election. After Trump withdrew the US
from the JCPoA in May 2018 and
Iranian general Qassem Soleimani
was killed on Iraqi soil in January
2019, the risk of cyberespionage or
more conventional attacks (such as
phishing or ransomware campaigns)
aiming to destabilise the then-US
President became markedly more
significant. In May and June 2020,
this fear was realised in the form of
an attack by the group Phosphorus, which gained access to several
accounts belonging to members of
the administration, Trump campaign
staff and others involved in the 2020
presidential election.
Twitter announced that it had deleted around 130 Iran-based accounts that had disrupted the public
conversation on the platform during

the first campaign debate between
Biden and Trump. This also illustrated a shift in technique as attackers targeted the two candidates
directly and the electoral process
itself. It is becoming more and more
difficult to predict this type of realtime attack and proactively analyse
the threat landscape to prevent
them.

Many of these disinformation campaigns have responded to significant
events such as the January 2017
massacre at a Quebec City mosque
or the June 2019 approval of the
Trans Mountain pipeline.

_MEXICO

_CANADA AND TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONS
In recent years, countries have
strengthened their diplomatic and
economic links with Canada as,
since 2017, the US has drifted further towards protectionism. The
US’s decision to heavily tax steel
and aluminium imports had been
extremely damaging to Canada and
the member states of the European
Union. The move even provoked
threats of retaliation from the EU,
Canada and Mexico. In May 2018,
Canadian Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau publicly declared his disap-

proval and, along with policymakers
in European countries, claimed that
the President’s invocation of the
national security defence, referring
to WTO regulations, did not hold
water.
It is therefore unsurprising to see
Canada looking to the nations of
the Old Continent for less protectionist economic partners, more
open to diplomatic relations.
This transition took a significant
step forward with the signing of
the Comprehensive Economic and
Trade Agreement (CETA) between
Canada and the EU in autumn
2016. The goal of this agreement
was to ease the export of Canadian
products to the European market
by almost completely eliminating
tariff and non-tariff barriers, while
creating a more stable investment
context for Canadian and European
businesses.
Prime Minister Trudeau and French
President Emmanuel Macron portrayed this bolstered Canada–
France relationship as favouring a
just, fair and rules-based international order. Canada and France have
instituted structural frameworks
for their joint activities, particularly
in the areas of culture, the environment, development aid, sustainable
development, artificial intelligence
and defence. The two countries
have committed to a joint meeting
of their cabinets with the goal of
building further institutional ties.

_IN CANADA, THE CYBERTHREAT ENVIRONMENT IS
CONSTANTLY CHANGING AS
BAD ACTORS CONTINUE TO
ADJUST THEIR STRATEGIES.
As Canadians adopt new technologies
and
Internet-connected devices, it is certain that new
threats will arise. Furthermore,
Canada’s rapprochement with Europe
may create a major risk from adversary foreign powers.
The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the cyberthreat
landscape in Canada. In 2019, the
medical laboratory company LifeLabs fell victim to a cyberattack
which compromised the personal
and medical data of 15 million Canadians. The company finally paid the
ransom to recover this data.
Geopolitical events such as the warming of relations between Canada
and the EU can also make cyberattacks more likely. For instance,
activists such as environmentalists
might aim to weaken CETA, as the
agreement eases the process of
importing polluting fuels and GMO
foodstuffs. This was observed in 2017
and 2019 when Twitter data revealed
that Russian and Iranian trolls had
been posting to the site using fraudulent accounts. The purpose of
this activity was to exacerbate divisions among Canadians and provoke
conflict by widening the reach of inflammatory content on political issues like terrorism, climate change,
pipeline construction, immigration
policy and refugees.

Although Mexico is a multiparty democracy, power remains concentrated in the hands of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI),
which controlled both chambers of
Congress and the presidency continuously from the Second World
War until 2018. Despite persistent
inequalities, the country’s industrial
sector has seen a meteoric rise
since the war.
Large oil reserves, exploited by
a state-owned corporation, have
contributed to Mexico’s economic
stability, which had been shaken
by plummeting prices during the
1980s.
However, Mexico’s ambition to become a major power on the international stage (and within North
America in particular) is hampered
by several factors, including crime
and immigration, which remains an
issue to this day.
_CRIME IN MEXICO
Mexican drug-trafficking cartels
are among the most developed organised crime rings in the world.
While fragmentation has reduced
the number of such groups with
large
international
operations,
those which remain have access
to networks covering most of the
Americas, even extending into Europe and Asia.
These international cartels interact
with foreign actors but generally
lack a strong grounding in Mexico.
Their activities more often take the
form of joint ventures with other
Mexican groups. These organisations focus on international drug
trafficking, which brings in millions
of dollars in revenue every year, but
also engage in other activities such
as oil theft, illegal logging, human
trafficking, kidnapping and extortion.

weapons, and conflict between rival

mon. Drug cartels control large
tracts of territory throughout Mexico, supplanting government authority by means of bribery and intimidation to facilitate illicit activities
and skew the democratic process.
Politicians are frequently assassinated or threatened by organised
crime groups, who ensure that public positions are filled by cooperative individuals.
In addition, the fragmentation
of cartels has produced smaller
offshoot groups with no permanent power structure, which pose
a security threat as turf wars become more common and localised. These groups generally lack
access to the necessary resources
to manage transnational drug trafficking networks and favour activities such as extortion, kidnapping,
vehicle theft, oil smuggling, human
trafficking and smuggling, wholesale drug dealing and illegal mining.
They play a key role in the drug
trafficking supply chain, handling
local transport and security within
wider networks.
While state actors do not control
criminal markets, corruption within the government and agencies
responsible for law enforcement
enables criminal networks and
shapes illicit activities, constituting a stream of income for highranking public officials.

_ORGANISED CYBERCRIME IN
MEXICO POSES A GROWING
THREAT TO CIVILIANS AS
WELL AS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ORGANISATIONS
As crime increases, the eyes of the
cybersecurity world have turned
towards the country. In fact, Mexico
has suffered more cyberattacks than
any other Latin American country
besides Brazil. In both countries,
emails containing links to malicious
websites are fairly common. Some
of these websites are believed to be
among the most prolific generators
of spam in the world.
Symantec placed Mexico among the
10 countries most affected by email
phishing scams. Mexico was ranked seventh, after Ireland, Australia,
New Zealand, Brazil, Norway and
the UK.
The last few years have seen
many criminal cyberattacks hit the
country. For example, sites belonging
to the Lotería Nacional y Pronósticos, the national lottery, were rendered inaccessible to visitors outside of Mexico after being targeted
using Avaddon ransomware.
Avaddon is found throughout the
world and spreads using emails
styled as love letters. It appears to
have been distributed by the botnet Trik (also known as Phorpiex)
since early June 2020. Avaddon’s
operators launched a data leak site

to extort victims in August of that
year. In conducting their activities,
the group observed the so-called
5×5 rule, wherein the starting price
in negotiations is placed at 5% of
the victim’s annual revenue, which
is estimated at a fifth of total revenue. Cybersecurity researchers at
Advanced Intel estimate Avaddon’s
total revenue at $87 million before
it ceased operations in June 2021.
Furthermore, attackers are increasingly using malware capable of
paralysing a whole set of systems,
including supply chains, manufacturing and payments, removing the
malware only after receiving substantial sums of money.
One notable example was the case of
Pemex, the Mexican state oil company, which was targeted using the
ransomware Ryuk. Ryuk generally targets businesses with revenue
between $500 million and $1 billion.
Although operations appeared to
continue as normal and petroleum
production and storage were not affected, this attack against critical infrastructure demonstrates the severity of the cyberthreat facing Mexico.

Contextual analysis of Latin America and geocyber risks
17 July 1979 remains a pivotal
date in the history of South
American geopolitics. A military
junta seized power in Managua,
Nicaragua’s capital, triggering
a civil war that engulfed the
country. The so-called Sandinista revolution marked the start
of more than 10 years of civil
war in Latin America.
Geopolitical tensions abound in
the Americas, fuelled by border
conflicts between countries or
social conflicts within them, as
well as the dominant role of the
United States.
Central and South America are
regions beset by perennial and
long-standing conflicts. In Central America, the Sandinista re-

_DEEP-ROOTED TENSIONS
IN CENTRAL AND SOUTH
AMERICA
In recent decades, urban conflicts
have erupted throughout Latin
America in response to several
phenomena including poverty and
rising inequality. As for international clashes, several Central and
South American countries have
been in conflict for many years.
Meanwhile, the same countries
are often plagued by internal tensions, as populations searching for
a new socio-economic order make
their grievances known through a
variety of protest movements.
_ECONOMIC MODELS IN LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES
Boosted by growth in the early
2000s thanks to sluggishness in
the US, South America has seen
some economic success. Brazil, for
example, is one of the five emer-

volution against the US-backed
dictatorship in Nicaragua in the
1970s marked the beginning of a
decade of strife.
In South America, some tensions are rooted in national borders drawn during the post-colonial period. The wounds of the
War of the Pacific, in which Bolivia lost its only province with
access to the sea to Chile, remain raw for many Bolivians.
The repercussions of this animosity are still being felt as Bolivia refuses to provide energy
resources to Chile. Since the
end of the 2000s, there have
also been significant tensions
between Colombia and Venezuela.

gent economies known as the
BRICS countries.
However, since 2011, this growth
has been merely relative, and most
Latin American countries have slid
into recession.
In fact, after a “golden decade”
between 2003 and 2013, during
which economies boomed and inequalities narrowed, Latin America’s
GDP (Gross Domestic Products)
per capita had collapsed to 2010 levels by the end of 2020. The price
of exported primary commodities
has weighed heavily on countries’
financial capacities as well as their
economic growth. The fossil fuels
sector has also been a factor in
this crisis: in 2014, oil prices plummeted in Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela.
_REGIONAL DIVISIONS
STOKING BORDER
CONFLICTS
Border conflicts in this region are
nothing new. For hundreds of years,
Latin America has been the setting

Despite these ongoing strains,
the continent is becoming more
and more integrated. Human
and capital flows are on the rise,
albeit oriented towards the US.
In North America, the USMCA

where capital and goods circulate freely. Its equivalent in the

and beyond.

for several international conflicts,
with some still ongoing that stretch
back to the 19th century.
Today,
political
disagreements
between countries continue for a
variety of reasons, including various permutations of nationalism
and conflicts of economic interest.
These battles are fought in the
raw materials sector, particularly
oil and gas, as well as within the
framework of increasingly fragile
regional alliances.
On 1 May 2006, Evo Morales nationalised Bolivia’s oil wells, hitting
Brazilian company Petrobras (a
third of whose shares are owned
by the Brazilian government) particularly hard and impacting other
foreign companies including Spain’s
Repsol. In response to objections
by Brazil, backed by Argentina, Bolivia gained the support of Venezuela, resulting in a temporary schism
between the region’s left-wing governments.
Furthermore, more than ten years
after its founding treaty was signed,
the Union of South American Na-

Areas of tension in the South American region

tions (UNASUR) is now moribund.
In 2018, six of its 12 members
announced their temporary withdrawal from the union and suspended their financial contributions
in response to the organisation’s
collective inability to designate a
new secretary general to succeed
the former president of Colombia.
This institutional breakdown is
the result of these countries’ shift
towards nationalism and prioritisation of their own economic interests, which has aggravated regional divisions and conflicts between
countries.
Their inward turn is hardly surprising, as many of them had endured
or continue to endure deep economic, political and social crises.
These situations dampen the driving force that motivates earnest
cooperation and regional projection,
instead favouring policy focused on
the internal welfare of the nation.
_FOREIGN POWERS CAN
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
DETERIORATING REGIONAL
UNITY THROUGH ESPIONAGE
ACTIVITIES
This was the case with ATK97,
known as “El Machete”, a cyberespionage group that has been active
since 2010. Its agents usually target the governmental and military
sectors in Latin America as well as
the US, Korea and several European
countries. The source code of the
group’s malware, which it usually
deploys in sophisticated spear phishing attacks, suggest that the developers are Spanish speakers. The
question of potential sponsorship
of the attacking group by a foreign
power remains unresolved. Most of
the victims of the group’s 2010 campaign of attacks were in countries
such as Venezuela, Ecuador, Colombia, Peru and Cuba.
Finally, it is interesting to note the
large number of countries around the
world that target this region with cyberattacks. In February 2021, of the
ten main countries from which attacks targeting Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Panama originated, China
was the source of 23,583 attacks,
Germany 10,847 and the US 10,019.

American societies. The OECD has
expressed concern at deteriorating
social cohesion and growing alienation between citizens and public
institutions in all countries in the
region.
With the exception of Venezuela,
where political and economic crises
have triggered a humanitarian crisis, the resultant turbulence has
manifested internally in other South American countries. Massive
protests erupted in Paraguay in op-

position to a decision by President
Mario Abdo to sign an agreement
with Brazil, considered disadvantageous to the small country,
concerning the Itaipu hydroelectric
power station.
Political tensions were particularly
marked in countries such as Peru,

dissolved Congress, triggering new
legislative elections. His actions led
to protests throughout the country.
In one case, protesters blocked acCyber Threat Handbook | 39

cess to a copper mine and forced it
to halt production.
In most countries, protests were
caused by political decisions that
may seem insignificant. However,
such decisions can exacerbate inequalities, increase tension in society and sometimes result in a
violent backlash by the population.
This was the case in Chile, in 2019,
where a political decision was made
to increase ticket prices on the
Santiago Metro.
This was merely a catalyst for a
much broader protest movement
challenging the Chilean economic model and spotlighting the

country’s inequalities. Surging poverty and inequality, deteriorating
public services and wage stagnation, combined with ever-increasing precarity and unemployment,
have laid bare widespread dissatisfaction and defiance towards elites
and governments.
In addition, corruption scandals
continue to come to light in a majority of countries, gradually under40

mining the legitimacy of political
systems and institutions as the public discovers their extent. The Odebrecht case embodies the current
situation with regard to corruption.
Some 10 countries have been impacted by the scandal, which led to
the downfall of Peruvian president
Pedro Pablo Kuczynski.
All of these factors have coalesced
to breed discontentment within Latin American societies and foster a
feeling of insecurity. Rising crime,
whether tangible or virtual, has
made the region one of the most
dangerous in the world.
Latin America is home to 40 of

the 44 cities where criminal activity poses the most severe threat.
For instance, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala have the highest homicide rates in the world. Much of this urban violence is
perpetrated by gangs, specialized
in drug trafficking. Indeed, due to
its geography, Latin America is an
active participant in the drug trade,
notably providing the US with co-

caine. Figures show that 80% of
cocaine arriving in the country
transits through Central America.
This lucrative and straightforward
business has led to the formation
of thousands of small, violent gangs
across the region (including maras,
Mexican cartels and Brazilian mafia
organisations). Law enforcement
and politicians are often powerless
to stop them, and the rot is often
worsened by corruption and public
officials accepting bribes.
_LATIN AMERICA’S
INSTABILITY HAS LED

OPENING THE DOOR FOR
CYBERCRIMINALS TO
CONDUCT VARIOUS TYPES
OF ATTACK CAMPAIGNS BOTH
WITHIN THE REGION AND
AROUND THE WORLD
These groups include ATK237, also
known as the Tetrade. This malware
family, of Brazilian origin, is characteristic of the country’s cybercrime
landscape. Until 2011, it primarily
targeted Brazilian victims, before expanding its focus worldwide. It comprises four malware families called
GUILDMA (aka Astaroth), GRANDOREIRO, JAVALI (aka Osaban) and
MELCOZ. Cybersecurity researchers from Kaspersky Lab identified this series of malware as being
responsible for attacks on financial
institutions in Brazil, other Latin
American countries and Europe. The
Brazilian cybercriminal underground
is known to be particularly geared
towards the development and sale of
banking trojans.
Finally, the group ATK243 (aka Carbanak or Anunak) is worth highlighting in order to demonstrate cybercrime’s important place in this
part of the world. The ATK243 label
was assigned to resolve confusion
between the aliases FIN7 and Carbanak/Anunak, two groups which are
tracked as a united operation. Their
common feature is the use of the
malware Carbanak. Note that, despite its shared interests with ATK32,
ATK243 is a separate group.
ATK243 was first identified in 2013.
Since then, they have attempted to
attack up to 100 banks, electronic
payment systems and other financial
institutions in around 30 countries,
including Brazil. According to data
from Kaspersky Lab, Cabarnak’s
targets include financial institutions
in Russia, the US, Germany, China,

Ukraine, Canada, Hong Kong,
Taiwan, Romania, France, Spain,
Norway, India, the UK, Poland, Pakistan, Nepal, Morocco, Iceland, Ireland, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, Brazil, Bulgaria and Australia.
_LATIN AMERICA
AND COVID-19
Covid-19 has caused over 1.5 million
deaths in Latin America and the
Caribbean, according to an AFP
study of official figures.
The early stages of the epidemic
were characterised by uncertainty,
as the region was initially only
marginally affected. However, Latin
America quickly became the hardest-hit region in the world (and
remained so until October 2020,
when the changing seasons put
Europe back in the lead), representing more than a quarter of the planet’s cases and a third of its deaths
with just 9% of its population.
The Covid death toll in Brazil has
exceeded 600,000, making it the
country with the second-most
deaths after the United States.
Mexico, Peru, Colombia and Argentina had the highest mortality rates
after Brazil.
In October 2021, Brazil was continuing to suffer heavily, with the hi-

Consequently, several indicators
have shown that Latin America is
on the verge of a major economic
crisis due to Covid-19 in the medium term. Countries in the region
lack resources, continue to fall deeper into debt and remain dependent
on raw materials exports to regions
in crisis, currently including China
and Europe.
The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean estimates that the pandemic will cause
the region’s economy to shrink by
5.3%, with 29 million falling into
poverty. South America will not return to its already poor pre-Covid
status quo until 2023 at best, and
possibly not until 2030.

ghest daily number of cases in the

Despite improvement, epidemics
have afflicted Latin America for decades, and the region accounts for
a disproportionate share of health
and economic costs as a result.
These challenges are compounded by rising hunger, economic
hardship, widening inequalities and
a rapidly approaching hurricane
season. Hunger and food insecurity have the potential to generate
widespread conflict, provoke political turbulence and force vulnerable
families to flee.

rise in brute force attacks due to
the increase in remote working. For
instance, the infamous ransomware
REvil, also known as Sodinokibi, was
one of the first to take advantage of
the pandemic to launch attack campaigns. In July 2020, REvil’s operators (ATK168) demanded a ransom of
$14 million from Brazilian electricity
provider Light SA. In 2021, Centrais
Eletricas Brasileiras (Eletrobras) and
the Companhia Paranaense de Energia (Copel), two major public electricity providers, announced that they
had suffered ransomware attacks in
the last week. In Copel’s case, the
attack was the work of the Darkside ransomware gang, who claim to
have stolen more than 1,000GB of
data including sensitive infrastructure access information and the personal details of top management and
customers. The attack on Eletrobras
affected servers on the company’s
administrative network and had no
impact on the operations of nuclear
power stations Angra 1 and Angra 2.

Cybersecurity company Fortinet recorded more than 2.6 billion cyberattack attempts in Brazil between
January and June 2020, out of a
total of 15 billion attempts in Latin
America and the Caribbean.
COVID has also led to an increase in
the use of phishing techniques by attackers. Cybercriminals would share
messages on WhatsApp aiming to
steal the victim’s personal data for
use in future attacks or trick the
victim into downloading legitimate
applications in order to collect payment from affiliate programmes.
Many elements of critical infrastructure in Brazil have been targeted
since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2020, the country saw a

_THE ARAB SPRING AND ITS
IMPACT ON THE MIDDLE EAST
In 2011, a wave of democratic protests swept across various countries in the Arab world. From Tunisia, the desire of the North African
peoples for democracy spread to
Western Asia, leading to radical responses, severe repression
(Kuwait) and even civil wars (Syria,
Yemen).
Initially, these protests took the
form of peaceful demonstrations,
where people expressed their disagreement with the political and
institutional systems, which they
deemed obsolete and corrupt.
The Middle Eastern region is built
around two types of political models: absolute or constitutional monarchies and republics. Many of the
most important uprisings were in
the Arab republics and have continued to this day in the form of civil
wars, most notably in Syria and Yemen. The countries of the Arabian
Peninsula, most of which are rentier states, have effectively established an unspoken social contract
by offering a high standard of living
for their populations.

form of a violent jihad. Jihad has
experienced several mutations. It
was theorized as a violent struggle
against the near enemy, which refers to the apostate regimes of the
Middle Eastern peninsula. The first
mutation appeared with Al-Qaeda.
The group exported jihad across regional border and started to target
the “far enemy”. Al-Qaeda first appeared in Afghanistan in 1987 and
has carried out numerous terrorist
acts, claiming responsibility for the
attack on the twin towers of the
World Trade Center in New York

in September 2001. The group is
still active in various parts of North Africa and the Middle East, with
the presence of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), the Arabian
Peninsula (AQAP) and the Indian
subcontinent (AQIS).
The second major mutation happened with Daech. The terrorist
group created a horizontal structure, relying on the masses. Formed in response to America’s intervention in Afghanistan in 2003,
it is mainly present in Iraq, where it
has its organisational core. It is also

present in North Africa, the Caucasus, Somalia, Southeast Asia and
the Indian subcontinent. In 2014,
Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi proclaimed
the creation of an Islamic State in
Iraq. The Islamic State group took
part in the Syrian conflict in 2013,
fighting both Kurdish militias and
Syrian regime forces, with the aim
of establishing an Islamic caliphate.
Building on an existing terrorist
group in the region, the Al-Nusra
Front, Islamic State became the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant
(ISIL).

CCA’s most significant cyber terrorist attack was in January 2015,
when the Twitter and YouTube accounts of US Central Command
and later the Twitter accounts of
Newsweek magazine were hacked.
• The Sons Caliphate Army (SCA)

was formed in 2016 as a subgroup
of the Cyber Caliphate. It is mostly
known for disrupting social media
traffic on Facebook and Twitter.
SCA claimed to have hacked into
10,000 Facebook accounts, over
150 Facebook groups and more
than 5,000 Twitter profiles.
• Kalashnikov E-Security Team was
initiated in 2016. This group focuses
on technology security consulting
for ISIS jihadists. It has uploaded
ISIS-related
jihadist
literature,
shared posts from cyber jihadist
groups, reported successful attacks
on websites or Facebook pages
and published various web hacking
techniques. Over time, the hackers
began to carry out or take part in
website hacking.
While we have not identified any
ATK133 attacks in almost two
years, it is highly likely that group
members have been redeployed to
new operations within other terrorist groups as a result of ISIS movements.

_CIVIL WAR IN SYRIA AND
YEMEN
When Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh was forced to accept the
terms of the revolutionaries under
the mediation of the Gulf Monarchies in 2011, no one thought the
country would collapse. However,
the now former President allied
with Shiite Houthi rebels, backed by

Iran, in order to regain power. The
country was plunged into a conflict
that became international in 2015
with the intervention of a Saudi-led
Arab coalition.
In Syria, the democratic aspirations
of 2011 quickly degenerated into a
civil war sparked by the killing of
children in Daraa by Bashar al-Assad’s regime. As with Yemen, the
conflict became international when
Islamic State got involved in 2013.
What began as a national conflict
quickly turned into a regional and
international conflict in which Russia, Iran and Turkey have taken
part. Russia and Iran have sent
militias to support President Assad’s regime and its strategic interests in the region. Turkey sent
in its armed forces in late 2019
after the US withdrawal from the
region, officially to protect its borders and fight jihadists. Unofficially,
Turkey has also been fighting the
Kurds, with whom it is in conflict
within its borders. This Kurdish population, present today in northern
Syria but also in Turkey, Iraq and
Iran, claims a territory in Syria’s
north. The Kurds, a minority which
has suffered for many years under
the Assad clan, were spread over a
territory straddling Iran, Iraq, Turkey and Syria, before the borders of
these countries were defined at the
end of World War II.
_USE OF CYBER WEAPONS IN
THESE CONFLICTS: THE EXAMPLE OF SYRIA
These conflicts also have a dimension that is much less reported in
the media because it is less visible:
cyber confrontations. In this respect,
the Syrian conflict demonstrates the
importance of the cyber weapon and
its use by the regime of Bashar al
Assad.
Firstly, the cyber tool allows the regime to carry out missions to spy
on the opposition. The technique
known as «man in the middle» allows
the interception of communications
between two stations without either
operator being aware of it1. Infowar
Monitor reported in May 2011 that
this type of attack was used in Syria on a secure version of Facebook,
allowing the attacker to access the
victim’s private conversations. Still
with the objective of espionage, the
Syrian government has used RATs
(Remote Administration Tools), proCyber Threat Handbook | 45

Geographical zones
grams that allow full remote control
of a computer from another device.
DarkComet is a French-made RAT
that has been modified to spy on Syrian revolutionary forces.
Secondly, the Damascus regime
uses the cyber tool to destabilize its
opponents. For example, the Syrian
government regularly cuts off the
country’s communications to interfere with the rebels’ exchanges.
In addition to cutting off the Internet and GSM networks at strategic
times, it may send a large number
of connection requests in order to
saturate the network.
The Syrian leaders regularly mobilise
hacker groups, such as ATK132 (Syrian Electronic Army) which carry
out DDoS (distributed denial of service) or defacement attacks. Certain
Arabic media outlets are regularly
targeted by the Syrian Electronic
Army (SEA). For example, the website of the Qatar-based Al Jazeera news channel was hacked by the
SEA in April 2012. At the same time,
the Twitter account of Al Arabiya, a
Saudi Arabian television news outlet, posted bogus messages about
an explosion at a Qatar gas facility,
the replacement of Qatar’s Prime
Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister
and the arrest of the Prime Minister’s daughter in London. The SEA
was almost certainly seeking to exacerbate the tensions between Qatar
and Saudi Arabia in order to undermine their partnership on the Syrian
issue. In January 2013, the Syrian
Electronic Army announced that it
had several documents detailing the
role played by Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar in the Arab world for
nearly two years. This information
was later published on the website
of Al Akhbar, a Lebanese newspaper
that is reputedly pro-Hezbollah. This
type of initiative is frequent and the
countries targeted are always those
that take an official position against
Bashar al-Assad and that are accused by the Syrian government of
militarily supporting the opposition.
_STRUCTURE OF THE CYBERTHREAT GENERATED BY THE
ASSAD REGIME
The Pat Bear group (ATK85) should
not be confused with the SEA,
though it is related to it. The SEA
emerged in 2011 to support the Assad government in the civil war, then
the regional war. Its objective was to
46

support the President’s image and
positions in a context of dissent and
violence against civilians. Logically,
the group uses website defacement,
spam, phishing and DoS techniques,
especially against opponents of the
regime. In 2014, the Golden Rat
group (ATK80) appeared. This group
also came out of the SEA, but it
does not have the same missions. It
specialises in espionage and mainly directs its actions at the national level. Pat Bear emerged in 2015
with the objective of launching cyber
offensive operations against the Sy-

(Syria, Yemen, etc.). This opposition is also evident in the realm of
cyberthreats.
_A BIPOLAR CONFIGURATION
REFLECTED IN CYBERSPACE
IIt appears that the Saudi bloc is
partly supported by the ATK144
group (DarkMatter, Project Raven).
Project Raven is a threat group that
has been conducting targeted spyware attack campaignsagainst Emirati journalists, militants, activists
and dissidents since at least 2012.

_THE IRAN-SAUDI
RELATIONSHIP
Iran and Saudi Arabia are two major regional powers whose fundamental mutual opposition tends
to shape tensions in the region. A
regional Cold War type scenario
has become established in the last
few years around two diametrically
opposed models. These two models, in the form of blocs, indirectly
confront each other in the region

2015

Circumstantial evidence suggests
that there could be a link between
this group and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) government. Project Raven is the offensive and operational
division of the National Electronic
Security Authority (NESA), the UAE
equivalent of the NSA. In 2016, this
project was moved to DarkMatter
and began targeting America. Raven’s targets include militants in
Yemen, foreign adversaries such as
Iran, Qatar and Turkey, as well as
specific individuals.
The opposition to the Saudi bloc has
been structured around groups that

are certainly Iranian in origin, such
as ATK40 (Oilrig), ATK26 (Rocket
Kitten), ATK35 (Magnallium), ATK19
(Cutting Kitten), ATK30 (Copy
Kitten), ATK51 (MuddyWater) and
ATK50 (Shamoon). These groups
have specialised in destructive wiper
malware attacks such as Zerocleare
and Shamoon. These are regularly
directed against vital Saudi organisations.
_THE 2017 QATAR CRISIS:
A SYMPTOM OF A BIPOLAR
STRUCTURE
From the 1990’s, Qatar gradually
broke away from the Saudi “bloc”
to demonstrate its independence
and moved closer to Iran. In June
2017, after some comments allegedly made by the Emir of Qatar in
which he praised Iran, Hezbollah
and the Muslim Brotherhood, the
petro-monarchies of the gulf severed diplomatic ties with Qatar.
On 16 July 2017, the Washington
Post claimed, based on sources
from the US Secret Service, that
the statement from the Emir originated from a computer hack perpetrated by the UAE. The objective of
destabilizing the Qatari emirate and
asserting Saudi power in the region
has proven to be counterproductive,
as witnessed by the rapprochement
between Qatar and Iran.
Above all, this crisis reveals the
fragmentation of the Middle East
around the opposition between
Sunni Wahhabi Saudi Arabia and
Shiite Iran. This confrontation is not
simply religious, with Sunnism and
Shiism, or cultural through Arab or
Persian influences, but geopolitical
with a desire for power and influence
in the Western Asia zone. As during the Cold War, the neighbouring civil wars in Syria, Yemen and
to a lesser extent Libya are turning
into theatres of indirect confrontation between the two blocs.

_JERUSALEM AND THE
ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN
CONFLICT
This diversity of religions lies at
the heart of the ancient problem in
the city of Jerusalem, which is the
cradle of the three monotheistic religions (Islam, Judaism and Christianity). Long contested because of
its religious significance, Jerusalem

today is the capital of both Israel
and Palestine.
In 1948, the declaration of independence of the Jewish State in Palestine, which then became Israel,
led the member countries of the
Arab League to contest and take
armed action against it. Numerous
confrontations between Arabs and
Jews ensued in the second half of
the 20th century, and countries
outside the conflict took a position.
What the Arab League contests is
Israel’s policy of expansion, which
it considers illegitimate. The Palestinians do not hesitate to protest
against this policy, and various terrorist movements have been born
out of this conflict. One example
is Hamas, which carried out suicide attacks until 2005 and now
focuses on attacks on Israeli cities. In response, Israel has stepped up its militarisation and accelerated the process of expansion
into the Palestinian territories. In
early 2021, clashes in Gaza, under
Israeli control, flared up again like
a recurring theme. They serve as a
reminder that the issue of territo-

ry that divides Israel and Palestine
is as contentious as ever, many
decades after the conflict began.
The conflict has given rise to several hacker groups, which structure
their actions around this issue.
_ATK89 (MOLERATS, GAZA
CYBERGANG) IS A POLITICALLY MOTIVATED GROUP. IT IS
ACTIVE WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING IN EUROPE AND THE
UNITED STATES, BUT MAINLY
IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND
NORTH AFRICA (MENA) AND
PALESTINE. THE GROUP IS
COMPOSED OF THREE SUBGROUPS:
• Gaza Cybergang Group 1 (aka MoleRATs). Its aim is to infect its
victims with a RAT, often via text
sharing platforms such as PasteBin, github.com, upload.cat and
others.
• Gaza Cybergang Group 2 (aka Desert Falcons). This subgroup uses
homemade malware tools and
techniques. Victims are often inCyber Threat Handbook | 47

fected by social engineering methods such as fake websites claiming to publish censored political
information, spear phishing emails
or social network messages.
• Gaza Cybergang Group 3 (aka
Operation Parliament). It focuses
on espionage and targets executive and judicial bodies around the
world, but mostly in the MENA
region, especially Palestine. The
group has used malware with
CMD/PowerShell commands for
its attacks.
Each group is different in its TTPs
(tactics, techniques and procedures), but they all use the same
tools after taking control of their
victims. ATK89 seems to still be active. In late 2020, it added two new
backdoors (DropBook and SharpStage) to its arsenal as well as a
downloader (MoleNet) in order to
target Israel in particular.
ATK66 (APT-C-23) is commonly regarded as an APT group linked to
the ruling Hamas organisation in the
Gaza Strip. The group was reportedly formed in 2011, but it became active in 2014, when the first attacks
were detected in the wild. By examining its victims and TTPs, it is
apparent that the group mainly attacks targets related to the Palesti48

nian Authority. APT-C-23 members
are native Arabic speakers in or from
the Middle East. One of the most
recent ATK66 campaigns began in
Palestine in late 2020 and targeted
people in the same region, including government officials, members
of the Fatah political party, student
groups and security forces.

_FINANCIAL RETURNS FROM
HYDROCARBONS AS A POLITICAL DRUG
The region is also rich in hydrocarbons (oil and uranium), which
ensures that the countries of the
Persian Gulf and Arabian Peninsula
benefit from significant financial returns. As a result, these countries
satisfy the primary needs of their
populations, such as medical care
and social infrastructure (universities, etc.) and even exempt them
from taxes.
Hydrocarbons are like a drug in the
Middle East. Internally, the rentier
countries enjoy the satisfaction of
substantial and continuous income
streams. However, this income is
dependent on world prices, which
can create a kind of “withdrawal”
effect. This serves as a geopolitical
lever in the region, especially in the

context of the Iran-Saudi Arabia
proxy conflict.
Riyadh and Tehran are among the
best supplied with hydrocarbons
and the largest producers in the
region. In 1960, they helped create
the Organisation of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) but
soon began to display doctrinal
divergences, especially at the Caracas summit in 1977, where the
members aligned around Saudi
Arabia’s productivist vision. Since
the 1980s, Saudi Arabia has increased its production in order to
bring down the price per barrel and
put financial pressure on Iran. The
Iranian economy, which was not
diversified at the time, was quickly
hit by American sanctions in the
1990s.
In the future, this energy lever could
pose a significant risk of geopolitical destabilisation and lead to an
increase in the level of cyberthreat.

Conclusion
As we have seen, the Middle
Eastern cyberthreat landscape
is shaped by several geopolitical factors. The region is highly
polarised around a fundamental divergence between Saudi
Arabia and Iran. This polarisation takes the form of a subre-

gional Cold War with a “bloc”
logic that is often reduced to
a simple opposition between
Sunnis and Shiites, but which
in reality is much more complex. These two blocs confront
each other indirectly in war
zones such as Syria and Ye-

men, as well as through militia
or Islamist intermediaries.
Ultimately, this complexity is
transposed into cyberspace
with an array of hacker groups
and a sustained level of activity.

The Far East is a vast area that comprises two naturally connected sub-areas: East
Asia and Southeast Asia.

economic sanctions against South
Korea in 2017. These sanctions
follow South Korea’s agreement
to host America’s Terminal High
Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)
anti-ballistic missile defence system4. On the other hand, relations between ASEAN, Japan and
the two Koreas remain cordial.
The Far East appears as a breeding ground for cyber threats.
At the regional level, a decisively
important game is clearly being
played out, fuelled by China’s desire to influence the zone and the
responses of the other countries.
Agendas are also being played out
in smaller arenas, as we will see
with the Korean question.

_THE FAR EAST AND CHINESE
POWER
Over the last decade, the cyberthreat landscape in this region
has been greatly impacted by the
growing influence of China as
an economic, political and cultural player. China has sought to
structure its presence by creating
international organisations in the
region and using them to exert its
influence.
Furthermore, the New Silk Roads
project launched by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013 directly serves Chinese foreign policy.
This project is supported by organisations with significant funds,
such as the Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank (AIIB).
Today, China is a key player in the
region and has been competing
with the Western powers for the
last decade. The growth of China as a focal point has prompted
the other Far Eastern countries
to adopt a cautious posture with
respect to Beijing.
For the main countries of the
zone, two objectives are emerging:
that of creating counterweigts to
Chinese influence with the aim
of strategic rebalancing, and that
of maintaining a peaceful relationship with Beijing in order to
preserve the economic ties.
Within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),
for example, trade between China and its southern interface has
created a strong interdependence,
so much so that China has become the largest trading partner in
the zone1.

_A REGIONAL STRUGGLE FOR
INFLUENCE REFLECTED IN
CYBERSPACE
From a geostrategic viewpoint,
Chinese domination is often presented as overwhelming and hard
to contest. Yet the cyber tool
creates a discrepancy in this logic of seemingly one-way domination. Indeed, the level of discretion and military effectiveness of
this weapon allows for a strategic rebalancing. This creates opportunities for other players to
assert themselves in the region.
This is evidenced by the activity
of several APT groups seeking to
be counterweights to Chinese influence.
_SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITY BY
GROUPS OF CHINESE ORIGIN
There are no less than 45 ATK
groups, known under more than
200 aliases, which appear to originate in China.

In turn, Japan has established
trade with the various countries
in the region and has maintained
relations with China, despite a difficult shared history and China’s
claim to certain islands in the archipelago. Tensions between the
two countries are ongoing in the
East China Sea over the delimitation of their exclusive economic
zones (EEZs).
North Korea is heavily reliant on

China, which accounted for 90%
of its trade before the Covid-19
crisis2. In addition, North Korea
remains the only country with
which China has signed a defence
treaty3.
Seoul remains relatively close
to Beijing, with regular bilateral
talks, which began to normalise in
late 2019. Trade between the two
countries is extremely limited,
however, since China introduced

_THESE GROUPS SHARE
A LOT OF TOOLS AND
MALWARE WITH EACH
OTHER, WHICH MAKES IT
DIFFICULT TO DELINEATE
THEIR ACTIVITIES
In 2014, the ATK34 group (Goblin
Panda) aided by the 1937CN group5,
launched cyber-espionage operations
on Vietnam’s oil sector. In 2016, the
same two groups carried out sabotage operations on the country’s
transportation sector, then in Au-

gust 2017 attacked its political institutions. This attack came a few days
after the re-emergence of tensions
around control of the South China
Sea between China and Vietnam,
which is set against the backdrop of
historic discord over the Paracel Islands6. On 5 August 2017, the meeting of foreign ministers of ASEAN
countries in Manila had resulted in a
resurgence of tensions provoked by
Vietnam against China.
In addition to the ATK34 group, of
which Goblin Panda is a part, the
ATK1 group (Lotus Blossom) regularly attacks the region. Before
2013, one of the group’s hackers
called Elise installed backdoors on
Southeast Asian networks, focusing especially on electronics manufacturers and telecommunication
companies, which enabled attackers
to penetrate the systems7. In 2015,
ATK1 conducted massive espionage
campaigns aimed at government
and military organisations across
Southeast Asia8. These campaigns,
whose objective was to weaken
political organizations and spy on
group members, are still ongoing.
The most prominent example is the
ASEAN, which suffered from a cyber
espionage attack operated by ATK1
in January 20189.
Other groups, considered less prolific, appear to be more responsive
to a political agenda. ATK34’s campaign of attacks on Vietnamese institutions in August 2017, for one,
reflects intensifying tensions with
China. The ATK29 (TEMP.Periscope)
group has also demonstrated its
ability to exploit local contexts and
leverage them into cyber attack opportunities. ATK29’s campaign in
Cambodia in July 2018 during the
legislative elections is indicative of
this trend. ATK29 group is interesting because the first evidence of its
activity dates from the start of the
Silk Roads project in 2013.
Initially focusing on the maritime domain, its range of targets was later
extended to the defence, transportation, engineering and space sectors.
In recent campaigns, it has directed
its attacks at the countries involved
in the Silk Roads project, reflecting
a shift in targets and paradigm. Its
activities have turned more particularly to industrial espionage and destabilisation. It was to this end that
ATK29 targeted Cambodia in July
2018. From September 2017, the
country had been plunged into si-

gnificant political stagnation, making
the attack all the easier. The leader
of the Cambodia National Rescue
Party (CNRP) had been charged
with treason and spying by Prime
Minister Hun Sen10. He had also
dissolved the CNRP, the only opposition party, ahead of the July 2018
legislative elections, which is when
the attack occurred. This created an
opportunity for the Chinese actor
to leverage its cyber arsenal to gain
high visibility on Cambodian politics
and the actions under consideration
by the government.
A similar scenario happened in the
Philippines in 2015. China refused to
take part in an arbitration procedure
with the Philippines at the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in
The Hague to settle territorial issues
in the Philippine Sea. In the same
year, Barack Obama raised the issue
of control of the South China Sea
at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit, which was
endorsed by the host country, the
Philippines11. Shortly after, ATK29
(NanHaiShu) attacked the Philippine
Department of Justice12.
_VIETNAM AND THE ATK17
GROUP (APT32)
VIETNAM ALSO MAINTAINS
THIS STANCE OF NON-SUBMISSION TO ITS GIANT NORTHERLY
NEIGHBOUR
Relying on a highly successful group
called ATK17 (APT32), Vietnam
conducts almost continuous espionage campaigns against diverse but
well-defined targets. The techniques
implemented by ATK17 include the
use of decoy documents that allow
for initial access to multiple platforms (Windows and MacOS in particular). The group was thus able to
achieve its objectives by carrying out
numerous attacks against Chinese
interests.
SOUTH KOREA IS ALSO RESPONDING TO CHINESE PRESSURE. KOREAN-SPEAKING
GROUP ATK52 (DARKHOTEL) IS
VERY ACTIVE AGAINST CHINA
While some experts link this threat
actor to North Korea, especially given the overlap between it and ATK4
(APT37), the consensus is that it is

actually linked to South Korea. It
targets government entities, especially in the areas of diplomacy, defence and justice. Its activity is focused in particular around the Sea
of Japan and the East China Sea. Its
purpose is to spy on specific people,
especially Chinese individuals. The
group leverages its cryptographic
skills to produce fake certificates
and use zero-day. It also has access
to an extensive and reliable network
infrastructure, which enables it to
maintain long-term access to its
targets.
_THE PHILIPPINES AND THE
NATIONAL BRANCH OF THE
LULZSEC MOVEMENT
TK129 (Pinoy LulzSec) is the Philippine branch of the international
LulzSec movement, embracing its
anarchist ideology. According to statements by its members, ATK129 has
been active since 2012, with a surge
of its activity in 2017 and 2018.
In April 2019, the Philippine government and its defence institutions
and industry were the victims of an
April Fools’ targeted campaign. The
hackers conducted dozens of attacks
during these campaigns, mainly website defacement and theft of data,
which was then leaked on online file
sharing platforms. The hackers primarily attacked government-related
targets, but they also targeted the
education sector.
These campaigns against the Philippine government came after President Duterte signalled a rapprochement with China. More recently,
the group’s attacks have directly
targeted the People’s Republic, with
the idea to pursue efforts to defend
the country’s sovereignty against
Chinese influence.
_TAIWAN AND THE ATK153
GROUP (APT-C-01)
Taiwan, with Hong Kong, is one of
the states most subject to Chinese
pressure and cyberattacks by
groups believed to be based in China.
However, the island state is supported by ATK153 (APT-C-01), an
APT group that has been conducting
cyber-espionage campaigns against
key Chinese units and departments

54

such as government, national defence, science and technology, education and maritime agencies for 11
years. The group mainly targets the
defence industry in connection with
strategic issues such as Chinese-US
relations, Cross-Strait relations and
maritime-related issues. This 11-year
series of cyber-espionage campaigns
in China includes no less than 15
major attacks on Chinese strategic
interests.
_THE KOREAN CHESSBOARD
Contrary to appearances, the Asian
chessboard is not only structured
around China as the focal point.
The Korean conflict is ongoing and
is guided and shaped independently
according to its own logics. On July
27, 2021, the two Koreas decided to
re-establish communication channels, witnessing a rapprochement.
Diplomatic ties had been cut a year
earlier, as a result of the stalled discussions. This resumption of dialogue comes at a time when North
Korea is going through a crisis related to the decline of its agricultural production, causing food shortages in the country.
The history between the two countries is complex and periods of escalation have followed periods of
relaxation. The rapprochement, initiated in the late 1990s around economic assistance, ended in 2008
with the arrival in power of the
conservative Lee Muyung-bak. The
dispute over the disputed maritime
zone regularly results in deaths on
both sides and the escalation of
tensions often lead to surges in cyber-activity from both sides.

Conclusion
Contextually, the cyberthreat in the Far East
is primarily driven by
the rise of Chinese influence.
For over a decade, this
geopolitical focal point
has prompted threat
groups in the region to
step up their activities
in support of the national interests of their
respective countries.
However, the cyberthreat is not only driven
by these regional factors. Certain geopolitical spaces have specific features linked to
their historic context,
as is the case with the
Korean peninsula.

_TENSIONS AND REGIONAL
INTEGRATION PROJECTS

Pakistan

South Asia is shaped by significant regional tensions, most notably between the three giants,
namely India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, but also by a desire for
rapprochement and integration
in order to protect from the influence of neighbouring powers.

Pakistan Kashmir

_AFGHANISTAN:
THE UNSTABLE STATE

_INDO-PAKISTANI TENSIONS
AND KASHMIR
The conflict between India and Pakistan began in 1947, when the two
countries gained independence and
the British Raj was split in two. Pakistan is a predominantly Muslim
country that was formed as the
Islamic Republic of Pakistan. India,
conversely, is a secular state that
inherited much of the territory of
the Raj.
Shortly after independence, the
First Indo-Pakistani war took place
in Kashmir. The Kashmir region,
independent since 1947, spans territories claimed by India, Pakistan
and China. Pakistan and India lay
claim to all of these territories. Reflecting this complex heritage, the
population of Kashmir is now predominantly Muslim, but it is ruled
by a Hindu Maharaja.
This first war ended in 1949 after
the United Nations brokered a ceasefire agreement based on a future Line of Control (LoC). Since
the LoC was established, Kashmir
has been a region in two parts: Indian Kashmir and Pakistani Kashmir. The Line of Control has become a militarised zone, with the
Indian and Pakistani armies facing

less, current tensions are high, and
groups of cyberattackers, suspected
to be from both countries, regularly conduct operations against each
other’s security forces. After the February 2019 suicide attack, the number of cyberattacks increased.
On the Pakistan side, ATK64 (alias
Mythic Leopard) is a Pakistan-based
group whose operations are most likely conducted from Karachi. It uses
social engineering and spear phishing to target Indian military and
defence entities.
On the Indian side, ATK11 (alias
Patchwork) is a cyber espionage
group active since at least 2010.
One of its specific techniques is the
use of code copied and pasted from
multiple online forums combined
with high-quality social engineering.
It began with Operation Hangover,
the purpose of which seemed to be
surveillance of targets of national security interest to India, such as Pakistan and the Nagaland movement.
The group was also involved in the
Monsoon campaign, which targeted
various sectors in India’s neighbouring countries.

off across the divide. The Indo-Pakistani conflict remains crystallized
on the Kashmir issue. Today, the
border between India and Pakistan
is considered one of the most dangerous in the world.
On 14 February 2019, tensions
between Pakistan and India reignited when a suicide attack claimed by Pakistan-based Islamist
group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM)
killed 41 Indian soldiers. The attacker was a 20-year-old Kashmiri rebel, whose act led to a resurgence
of military activism in the region.
Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of
India since 2014, condemned the
attack and announced that there
would be a response.
On 18 February, in retaliation, India conducted an armed raid in the
area where the attack had taken

place. Nine people were killed in
the town of Balakot, where a JeM
training camp is located. The resurgence of terrorist attacks in the
region is worrisome for the Indian
government, which is using all
possible means to protect against
them. Since both countries are
nuclear powers, and the border
between them is one of the most
militarised in the world, an open
conflict would be devastating for
the region.
_FOR THIS REASON, THE
CYBER LEVER APPEARS THE
BEST WAY FOR EACH SIDE
TO ASSERT ITS CLAIMS
Indo-Pakistani tension is mostly latent, with no open and direct
confrontation since 1971. Nonethe-

India and Pakistan have different
relationships with Afghanistan. Historically, each country’s bilateral
relations with its Afghan neighbour
have oscillated between long-term
support projects and containment
actions linked to the presence of
the Taliban.
India was the only South Asian
country to recognise the Soviet-backed Democratic Republic of
Afghanistan in the 1980s. In turn,
Pakistan suffered destabilisation attempts perpetrated by the Soviets
and implemented by the Afghan
government with the objective of
arming Pakistan’s Pashtun independence fighters so they could
overthrow the regime of the time.
Since then, Pakistan has continued
to treat its westerly neighbour with
suspicion.
With the rise of the Taliban movement, both countries have maintained their course of action. India
supported the then regime, helping
overthrow the Taliban, while Pakistan has been regularly accused
by Afghanistan of funding the mujahideen through its Inter-Services
Intelligence (ISI).
Before the Taliban came to power,

India provided Afghanistan with
substantial aid (it was the fifth largest contributor in 2017 with $3
billion) and maintained its stance
toward the Taliban. However, the
summer 2021 was marked by a
formal meeting between Taliban
leaders and an Indian delegation in
Qatar.
Relations between Pakistan and
the Taliban are more complex,
especially since the Taliban announced that it does not recognise
the Durand Line, which marks the
border between the two countries.
Furthermore, Pakistan, like Afghanistan, has suffered Taliban attacks
on its soil, which has prompted the
two countries to cooperate more
closely in recent years.
Despite Afghanistan’s instability
and this historic context, both India
and Pakistan are trying to cooperate with their neighbour. Notably,
Pakistan has reached a Memorandum of Understanding with Afghanistan for the establishment of
the Afghanistan-Pakistan Transit
Trade Agreement (APTTA) and the
construction of a rail link between
the two countries. This cooperation
may extend to joint defence and intelligence sharing operations.
In turn, India, which historically
has a stronger relationship with
Afghanistan, has set up agricultural development projects on Afghan
territory and, in the last decade, several hundred Afghan soldiers have
been trained at Indian institutions.
_DESPITE THESE PARALLEL
BILATERAL COOPERATIONS,
WHICH REMAIN IN PLACE TODAY, CYBER OPERATIONS ARE
STILL BEING CONDUCTED
For example, the ATK64 group
(Transparent Tribe, APT36), suspected of being sponsored by Pakistan,
has repeatedly targeted Afghanistan
in espionage operations. The most
recent attacks were in July 20211.
Another attacker group known as
SideCopy APT, affiliated with Pakistan, has led attack campaigns
against public and private organizations in South Asia, including ministries in India and Afghanistan. In
2021, some of the most notorious
victims included Afghanistan’s ministries of finance and foreign affairs, the administrative office of
the Afghan president, and a computer containing the credentials of

the Indian government and education departments. In the case of
the attacks against Afghanistan,
the attacker was able to exfiltrate
numerous personal documents including diplomatic visas as well as
the IDs of Afghan government officials. SideCopy APT uses fake documents as well as Trojan Horses
distributed via spear-phishing techniques2.

_COMMITMENT TO REGIONAL
INTEGRATION
_SOUTH ASIAN ASSOCIATION
FOR REGIONAL COOPERATION
At the regional scale, the eight
South Asian countries created the
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in 1985
to promote cooperation between
member states and drive economic
development.
This regional organisation has permanent links with the United Nations as an observer. It has also
developed ties with other regional organisations such as the European Union. In 2006, SAARC
created the South Asian Free Trade
Area (SAFTA) encompassing 1.6 billion people.
At the local level, cooperation projects are emerging. In 2015, the gas
pipeline project linking four South
Asian countries, namely Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and
India, was born. This project, which
allows the countries to achieve
greater energy autonomy, strengthens the ties between the South
Asian states.
These various cooperation projects,
aimed at better regional integration
and economic development, are
also intended to give the countries
in the region greater autonomy with
respect to neighbouring powers.
The region is surrounded by China
to the north and east and by Iran
to the west. It should also be noted
that Russia, further north, has a
historic influence in the region. This
influence has been achieved by cyberthreat actors suspected of being
sponsored by these neighbouring
powers.

Conclusion

A COMPLEX SINO-INDIAN RELATIONSHIP, SOURCE OF POLITICAL TENSIONS AND CYBER OPERATIONS
China and India are states that share
many similarities. Formerly under
colonial rule, both countries have
experienced exceptional economic
and demographic growth that has
allowed them to assert themselves
as major powers at the regional and
global levels. The two governments
maintain close relations, particularly at the economic level, marked by
bilateral partnerships and their leading role in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). In spite of
this collaboration, tensions remain
between the two political regimes
as they clash over their common
frontier as well as over the trade
routes developed in recent years.
CONFLICT AROUND THE SINO-INDIAN BORDER ZONE
June 15, 2020 is an important
date in the evolution of the border
conflict between the two countries. For the first time in 45 years,
the frontier zone was the scene of
violent clashes leading to the death

60

of Indian and Chinese soldiers in
the mountainous Galwan River valley. This historic conflict is based
on divergent views between the
two regimes, with India considering the frontier region to be nearly 3500 km long, compared to an
estimate repeated by the Chinese
media of around 2000 km. While
the likelihood of an open conflict
between India and China remains
low, the intensification of tensions
related to the frontier regions could
lead both sides to resort more frequently to the cyber tool.
SILK ROAD AND FREEDOM
ROAD: A SYMBOL OF SINO-INDIAN RIVALRY
In 2013, Xi Jinping gave a speech
in Astana in which he unveiled the
comprehensive project to build infrastructure along the ancient Silk
Roads. This project called «The New
Silk Roads» shows the Chinese hegemonic ambition to create a new
strategic paradigm along land and
sea routes. In order to compete
with this ambition, India and Japan
have developed an infrastructure
and transport project that is sup-

posed to revitalize the trade routes
between the Asian and African
continents: the «Freedom Road».
The rivalry between both projects
tends to intensify tensions between
Beijing and New Delhi. The port of
Gwadar, a symbol of the «New Silk
Roads», has to face competition
from the port of Chabahar, inaugurated in 2017 by an Indo-Iranian
alliance wishing to challenge the
grip of Chinese influence in Central
Asia.

South Asia is a geographic region that tends to move towards closer unity despite the dissensions and diversities.
It is physically permeated by
contradictory geopolitical issues, culturally shaped by beliefs, which are hard to reconcile, and historically marked
by a heritage of conflict. Tensions between India and Pakistan, the instability of Afghanistan and the great difference
in development and wealth
between the countries make

regional integration unlikely.
This is reflected in the many
cyberattacks between groups
in these countries.
However, the states in question
are trying to overcome the difficulties through development
projects, bilateral and multilateral cooperation and the creation of a free trade area.
These challenging attempts are
motivated by an awareness of
a broader contextual dimension. Regional integration, albeit imperfect, should help the

countries in the region protect
from neighbouring influences
and gain significance on the
international stage in an autonomous manner.
As we have seen, cyberattacks
from neighbouring countries
occur regularly and often focus on destabilisation and espionage by exploiting these
historic, cultural and physical
animosities.

THE RISE IN SINO-INDIAN TENSIONS HAS LED TO A SHARP
INCREASE IN CYBER ESPIONAGE
ACTIVITIES BY CHINESE-BASED
ATTACKER GROUPS ON INDIAN
TERRITORY
The energy sector has been particularly affected, as have port facilities. TTPs analysis seems to correlate these actions to the activity of
Chinese attacker groups, including
APT41, Tonto Team or even RedEcho.
In 2013, India announced its desire to
compete with the «New Silk Roads.»

Contextual analysis of Oceania and geocyber risks
Oceania extends over a vast
area of the Pacific Ocean, and
encompasses different sub-regions made up of island states
and island groups, including
Melanesia (the Solomon Islands,
Fiji and Vanuatu), Micronesia
(Mariana Islands, Marshall Islands, Caroline Islands, Nauru
and Guam), and the islands of
Polynesia (Hawaii and Easter
Island). It also includes New
Zealand and Australia, larger
countries which are more economically developed than the island states.
The region’s dynamics play out
at Pacific-wide, sub-regional,
and island levels. While Austra-

_AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND EXPERIENCE INCREASING TENSION IN RELATIONS

_TENSIONS BETWEEN CHINA
AND AUSTRALIA
Australia and China have adopted
a more confrontational approach to
each other.
In 2018, bilateral relations between
Australia and China appeared to
be at their lowest ebb for a decade
when Australia ruled out Chinese
telecom giant Huawei from building
its 5G network on national security grounds. Over the year 2020,
however, the relationship between
the two countries has deteriorated
even further, at a critical time for
the region.

Oceania are still over-dependent

to the development of a “north-south” divide in the region.

international relations, Oceania

post-war period. Australia and

and economic links. On April 19,
2020, Scott Morrison’s government upped the stakes even further with its proposal for a global
inquiry into China’s handling of the
Covid-19 epidemic in Wuhan, thereby suggesting that China might
be responsible for the global pandemic, and leading to an immediate
response from the Chinese government.
Australia and China subsequently became embroiled in an escalation of trade disputes. Starting
in May 2020, for example, China
introduced a series of commercial
sanctions against Australian products. The sanctions resulted in
higher tariffs and stricter quotas
being imposed on Australian products such as wine or barley.
In parallel with these commercial tensions, diplomatic disputes
between the two countries also
intensified. In May 2020, the Morrison government used its veto
power to cancel Chinese investments that were to expand the

The decolonisation process has
also focused attention on the
challenges and vulnerabilities of
small states in the region. The
economic and political emergence of Asian powers has
driven the development of closer links with Asia, and a stronger sense of belonging to the

While retaining ties with the
UK and with their European
heritage, Australia and New
Zealand are also turning to the
United States as a key security
ally, evidenced notably in the
AUKUS alliance in 2021, associated with the nuclear submarines scandal.

continent, in the state of Victoria.
In July 2020, Canberra promise to
offer a safe haven to residents of
Hong Kong after China rolled out
its national security law to the city.
The Chinese embassy in Australia
responded by accusing Canberra of
political interference in China’s internal affairs.
In November 2020, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao
Lijian tweeted – via his official
Twitter account – a controversial
fake image depicting an Australian
soldier holding a bloodied knife over
the throat of an Afghan child. Canberra requested that China apologise for this attack on the conduct
of Australian soldiers in Afghanistan, but received no reply.
This series of diplomatic incidents
between the two countries must be
viewed within the context of Australia’s broader security concerns
about Chinese growth presenting a
threat to the Asia-Pacific region. In
response to the issue, Australia has

consolidated its collaboration with
allies and regional partners, such
as the United States, the United
Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand,
Japan and India.
_ESCALATING ECONOMIC
AND DIPLOMATIC TENSIONS
IN 2020 BETWEEN CHINA
AND AUSTRALIA HAVE ENCOURAGED OFFENSIVES BY
CHINESE ATTACK GROUPS
AGAINST AUSTRALIAN TARGETS, NOTABLY NATIONAL
UTILITIES AND HOSPITALS
In June 2020, the Australian government issued an advisory on
increased cyber activity by a state
actor against networks belonging to
its agencies and companies in the
country.
According to the Australian’s government, the attack was operated
by a state-sponsored actor that relied on an exploit code which had
been slightly modified for past vulnerabilities. Unofficially, China was bla-

med. The actor targeted public-facing infrastructure through the use
of remote code execution vulnerabilities. This was the fourth warning in
a year from the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) about threat
actors exploiting critical vulnerabilities in Telerik UI (CVE-2019-18935,
CVE-2017-9248,
CVE-2017-11317,
CVE-2017-11357). Exploit code had
been publicly available for a while. If
they failed to gain initial access by
leveraging these flaws, the attacker
turned to spear phishing to harvest
credentials, deliver malware, and
steal Office 365 OAuth tokens.
A link to China is provided by the
threat actor’s use of malware –
such as PlugX – that has been associated with Chinese hacker groups,
some believed to work on behalf of
the government. Several actors, all
connected to China and engaged in
espionage activities, have PlugX in
their toolset (ATK2, ATK37, ATK220,
ATK41, and ATK15).

_NEW ZEALAND’S POSITION
IN THE OCEANIA REGION
The intensification of tensions
between China and Australia
raises questions about New Zealand’s strategic positioning in this
new context. On the one hand,
the country is a historical ally of
Australia and the trans-Tasman
relationship was built around a
common British colonial heritage.
The two countries are part of the
Commonwealth of Nations, the
Five Eyes for strategic intelligence
sharing, and have developed economic collaboration around the
Closer Economic Relations (CER)
free trade agreement. On the other
hand, China accounts for nearly 30% of Australia’s exports and
maintaining a peaceful bilateral relationship is critical to the sale of
Australian dairy products overseas.
In May 2020, the Five Eyes alliance
(Canada, the United States, the
United Kingdom, Australia and New
Zealand) decided to broaden its preCyber Threat Handbook | 65

Geographical zones
rogatives to allow for the display of
a unique posture on issues related
to democracy and fundamental human rights. In November 2020,
this new role took shape when the
alliance condemned China’s intervention in Hong Kong and called for
the reinstatement of the members
of the Legislative Council who had
been suspended by Beijing. This declaration also denounced the treatment of the Uighur population.
While New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern spoke of the
difficulty of «reconciling» differences
between the two countries, Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta refused
to join the Five Eyes alliance’s
condemnation of the treatment of
the Uighur minority in Xinjiang province.
This statement, in addition to jeopardizing the alliance’s political
project, shows the fragility of New
Zealand’s diplomatic position, torn
between preserving its relationship
with Australia and its economic

well-being. The progressive militarization in the South China Sea and
Chinese interference in Hong Kong
could lead New Zealand to adopt
a clearer strategic line in the future. Depending on the positioning
chosen, New Zealand could become a breeding ground for offensive
activity by Chinese cyber attackers.

_AUSTRALIA AND THE NEW
AUKUS ALLIANCE IN THE INDO-PACIFIC REGION
AUKUS (an acronym based on the
country names Australia, United
Kingdom and United States) is a
new trilateral strategic defence alliance. It was initially created for
the purpose of constructing a class
of nuclear-powered submarines,
collaborating in the Indo-Pacific
region (where the rise of China is
viewed as a growing threat), and
developing more advanced tech-

nologies. The agreement led Australia to terminate the contract
awarded to France in 2016 for the
construction of 12 diesel-electric
submarines to replace its ageing
fleet of Collins-class submarines.
Australia decided in November
2021 to engage alongside its American and British allies.
Aside from the United Kingdom,
this is the first time that the
United States has shared nuclear
propulsion technology with an ally.
Consequently, many observers
believe that Australia, the United
Kingdom and the United States
have entered into a historic nuclear
defence and security agreement
which will have consequences in
the Indo-Pacific region for decades
to come. The agreement will enable Australia to build a fleet of at
least eight nuclear attack submarines in order to counter Chinese
influence.
However, it is also interesting to
note that the AUKUS agreement
will include artificial intelligence as
well as other technologies, such
as cybersecurity. AUKUS could
therefore be one of the most important defence and cooperation
alliances for decades.
According to the associated press
release, the partnership is a historic opportunity for the three
nations to protect their shared
values, and contribute to the stability and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region, together with friends
and partners who share the same
ideas.
The decision to involve Australia in the longstanding cooperation
between the US and the UK reflects
the West’s growing concern about

66

Beijing’s military expansion, debt diplomacy and cyber-intimidation.
_THE AUKUS ALLIANCE GOES
WELL BEYOND JUST SUBMARINES
Attention has focused on French
and Australian diesel/nuclear submarines, and military hardware is
certainly a key component, in view
of the geopolitical issues at stake.
However, the agreement also covers
other forms of conflict. The AUKUS
alliance attaches particular importance to cyberspace.
At the press conference announcing the agreement, US president
Joe Biden said that a cybersecurity
component would be included, in

addition to submarine technology.
Although President Biden did not
specify this during the press conference, it appears probable that the
United States and the UK would
support Australia in the deployment
of cyber-defence, and potentially also
cyber-attack, capabilities.
In recent years, Australia has been
the target of several major cyber-attacks, one of the most striking of
which took place in June 2020.
Australian Prime Minister Scott
Morrison went on the record to officially state that the country had
been the subject of a sophisticated
state-sponsored cyber-attack.
Suspecting that China was responsible, Mr Morrison said that he
had talked to British Prime Minister
Boris Johnson about the incident,
although it is uncertain whether the
United Kingdom had provided cyber-expertise to Australia.

as companies in the telecommunications sector are not spared.
They notably used the Elise
malware, it was intended to spy on
many government organizations,
mainly in Southeast Asia. We can
think that this campaign was intended to support the Silk Roads
project by securing the maritime
side of the latter.
At the end of 2015, its “Emissary”
malware received numerous updates, probably to avoid being detected by security products. After
a very active period, the group remained discreet until the beginning
of 2017.
Other campaigns were carried out
sporadically until 2018, still using
Elise as the main attack vector,
and sometimes using new exploits,
such as CVE-2017-11882. ATK1 is
capable of performing very large
operations over a long period of
time, while developing its specific
arsenal.
These targets are extremely precise and the group rarely deviates
from them.

reveals that they correspond to the
preferred geographic areas followed
by offices 2 and 6 (units 61398

significant part of the email threat
landscape and is responsible
for the largest malicious spam

observed, distributing instances of
the Dridex banking trojan, Locky
ransomware, Jaff ransomware, the
Trick banking trojan, and several
others in very high volumes.
ATK103 use Necurs botnet to drive
massive spam campaigns. ATK103
seems to be motivated by financial
gains. It is hightly adaptable,
often changes its malwares and
techniques,
uses
off-the-shelf
malwares and operates on a
massive scale. It doesn’t seem to
be trying to stay stealthy. Since
March 2018, ATK103 was observed
using
FlawedAmmyy
RAT,
a
variant of the leaked AmmyyAdmin
3 (Remote Administration Tool).
The use of these tools can make
us think that this actor wants to
switch from big spam campaigns
to more targeted attacks. In July
2018, ATK103 has been seen
using the SettingContent-ms files
in their decoy documents. This
technique has been described by
Matt N. and in early June 2018,
MSRC responded with a note that
the severity of the issue is below
the bar for servicing and that
the case will be closed. Some of
these malwares were signed with
a COMODO SECURE certificate.
ATK103 seems to be a Russian
speaking group.

- However, this relationship is not
limited to ATK104. We know
that the ATK86 group (Silence

Threat Actor_

_DESCRIPTION

Targeted Areas_

ATK104 - First observed in mid2014, this malware shared code
with the Bugat (aka Feodo) banking
Trojan. However, Mummy Spider
swiftly developed the malware capabilities to include an RSA key exchange for command and control
communication and a modular architecture.
Mummy Spider does not follow typical criminal behavioral patterns.
In particular, Mummy Spider
usually conducts attacks for a few
months before ceasing operations
for a period of between three and
12 months, before returning with
a new variant or version. After
a 10 month hiatus, Mummy Spider returned Emotet to operation
in December 2016 but the latest
variant is not deploying a banking
Trojan module with web injects, it
is currently acting as a loader delivering other malware packages.
The primary modules perform reconnaissance on victim machines,
drop freeware tools for credential
collection from web browsers and
mail clients and a spam plugin for
self-propagation. The malware is
also issuing commands to download and execute other malware families such as the banking Trojans
Dridex and Qakbot.
Mummy Spider advertised Emotet
on underground forums until 2015,
at which time it became private.
Therefore, it is highly likely that
Emotet is operated solely for use
by Mummy Spider or with a small
trusted group of customers.
The group is composed of competent personnel, and Emotet is
regularly considered as one of the
most threatening malware for businesses.

ATK104
(aka: Mummy Spider) is a
criminal entity linked to the core
development of the malware most
commonly known as Emotet or Geodo.

The group seems to have an interesting interaction with the
ATK103 (TA505). TA505 is a financially motivated group that is
active since 2014, seemingly of
Russian origin. It is a significant
part of the email threat landscape
and is responsible of large malicious spam campaigns, mostly to
distribute the Dridex and Trickbot banking trojan, the Locky and
Jaff ransomwares, among others.
TA505 use Necurs botnet to drive
these campaigns. It is highly adaptable, often change its malwares
and techniques, regularly use offthe-shelf malwares and operate on
a massive scale.
Since March 2018, ATK103 was observed using FlawedAmmyy RAT, a
variant of the leaked AmmyyAdmin
3 (Remote Administration Tool).
The use of these tools can make
us think that this actor is willing to
switch from big spam campaigns
to more targeted attacks.
First, TrickBot is probably the
most distributed malware by Emotet, and has been distributed nearly every day since September 2018.
The links were rather tenuous
however, and TrickBot was just
another malware dropped by Emotet until September 2019. In the
beginning of June 2019, the group
took a break until September 16,
2019. The group, as previously
mentioned, came back with a new
infrastructure zone (Epoch 3).
Since this day, every time that a
TrickBot malware is deployed via
Emotet (currently, nearly every
day) its tag (an identifier that is
added to every build of TrickBot)
follows a specific pattern, while
previous distribution tags were
seemingly random. This hints to
a bigger cooperation between the
ATK103 group and Emotet. Moreover, on September 18, 2019 the
group introduced a new loader. This
loader, that is bigger, shares some
code with the TrickBot loader.
This might mean that the group

used the summer break they took
to strengthen their relationships
with ATK103. Indeed, deploying the
group malware in a privileged way
is one thing, but potentially sharing code is another.
On 27 January 2021 Europol announced that the infrastructure
of the Emotet network had been
neutralised through a multilateral
police operation.

_DESCRIPTION

espionage group active since at
least 2010. One of its specificity is

ATK11 - It started by the Operation
Hangover which goal seemed to be
the surveillance of targets of national security interests for India
such as Pakistan or the Nagaland
movement. This group was involved in the Monsoon campaign targeting multiple Indian neighbours
in various sectors.
Patchwork used actuality/sector
related themes in lure documents
exploiting known vulnerabilities in
Microsoft Office software send via
email with links to websites customized for the intended target. The
group is continuously adding new
exploit in their arsenal.
Patchwork uses different web
services as C2 channel like RSS
feeds, Github, forums, blogs or dynamic DNS hosts. These channels
can be difficult to detect in legitimate traffic.
Some RTF files used by this group
were linked with C2 servers which
were compromised and defanced
by Cyber Gangsters which is an
anti-Pakistan group. By following
the alias Fortinet managed to get
his identity in their article of April
2017. Nevertheless, Fortinet says if
it is really linked to the Badnews
malware or if it is a coincidence.
Multiple articles showed similarities between Patchwork behaviors
and other Confucius, Bahamut,
Donot Team or Bitter Apt, but
there is no definitive conclusion as
to whether these groups are the
same or not.

Re-emergence
of the Inception
Group

This group used a large CnC
network of infected machines and
dozens of domain names working
as a chain of proxies to hide the
attacker’s location. Cloud Atlas
is able to target mobile devices,
network equipment and removable
disk drives increasing the quantity of sensitive data accessible.
They use multiples exploits but not
0-days which can be interpreted as
a lack of ressources.
Cloud Atlas created the Inception framework. A sophisticated
framework able to launch multiple modules allowing the group to
adapt to its target. This framework
is still used in 2019.
After the Kaspersky disclosure in
2013, the group hid and then reappeared in 2014 with the Cloud Atlas malware. This behaviour will be
repeated thereafter in 2014 after
the publication of Symantec. The
group improved its C2 infrastructure in 2014 by using cloud services
which have the advantage of not
being blacklisted and use encrypted communication protocols. They
can also use compromised router
as proxies to hide their origin.
According to DomainTools the
ATK116 group (Inception, Cloud
Atlas) was active in October-November 2020 in the conflict
between Azerbaijan and Armenia in

2015

2016

2017

of a decoy article entitled: Armenia transfers YPG/PKK terrorists

_DESCRIPTION

Threat Actor_

ATK117 - This North Korean
state-sponsored cyberthreat actor
has similar prerogatives to those
of Unit 180 of the North Korean
Army’s General Reconnaissance
Bureau. The Unit 180 is the North
Korean Unit in charge of obtaining
funds for the cyber activity and
for the Noth Korean regime. This
activity exists since at least 2014
and seems to have been increasing since North Korea has been
subject to severe financial sanctions due to the development of
new weapons. The economic pressure on Pyongyang leads the North Korean government to find new
ways to obtain funding.

APT38 is a North Korean financially
motivated threat group who developed multiple ways to steal money
from the targeted attacks on banks
and cryptocurrency exchanges to
the spreading of ransomwares.
This group seems to be learning
about financial transaction in 2014
and developed a SWIFT malware
in 2015. From 2014 to 2017 they
mostly targeted organizations from
Southeast Asia and expand to South America and Africa in mid-2016.
They also targeted Europe and North America from October 2016 to
October 2017.
APT38 has a complete arsenal of
malwares and tools using defense
evasion techniques and false flags
(use of some poorly translated
Russian language in some malwares, re-useage of known malwares).
It is possible that these malwares
were developed by another Unit
(such as Unit 31), these techniques
could be used by other North
Korean groups. Despite this arsenal, APT38 uses Live-of-the-Land
tools when it is possible. They put
an effort into discovert the targeted
environment and maintain access
as long as possible while staying
undetected unitil they reach their

goal. FireEye estimates that they
stay in a victim network approximately 155 days.
Since 2018 the group has gone
from stealthy to noisy using the
destructive KillDisk malware as
a distraction tactic while they are
targeting the SWIFT network to
initiate malicious transactions.
We suspect the Unit 180 to be
source of the WannaCry ransomware in 2017.
The report from the UN Security
Council said that North Korea is
carrying out “widespread and increasingly sophisticated” cyberattacks and estimates that North Korea has generated $2 billon.

_DESCRIPTION

Targeted Areas_

ATK120 - LYCEUM may have been
active as early as April 2018. Domain registrations suggest that a
campaign in mid 2018 focused on
South African targets has been
conducted by ATK120. In May 2019,
the threat group launched a campaign against oil and gas organizations in the Middle East. This
campaign followed a sharp uptick
in development and testing of their
toolkit against a public multi-vendor malware scanning service in
February 2019. Its target core is
very similar to that of the APT Xenotime (ATK91), and some similarities can be found with Magnallium
and Chrysene. No definitive links
can be established.

ATK120
(aka: Lyceum, Hexane)
This threat group targets
organizations in sectors of strategic
national importance, including
oil and gas and possibly
telecommunications.

ATK128 is mostly known for taking
over Twitter accounts of high ranked personnel such as CEOs of large
cooperations and more, and Twitter
accounts of organizations themselves. In most cases they claimed that
they took over the account to show
its owner its low level of security,
while requesting them to contact the
group directly to solve this problem.
This shows that the group presents
itself as a kind of a grey-hat group
who looks for vulnerabilities and security issues in order to receive money from the companies in which
these issues were found. This was
also the case with the two DDoS attacks they launched against HSBC
bank and Pokemon Go (in 2016 and
2017 respectively), allegedly to enhance the level of security of those
companies. However, even though
OurMine tried to show themselves
as a group that enhances cyber security of companies, some of their
attacks were done as a revenge. For
example, they took over a media website after publishing an article that
allegedly revealed the real identity of
the threat actor behind the group,
a teen from Saudi Arabia. Another
example was when they leaked information of a company that did not
contact them about security issues
they found in its servers. Furthermore, in some cases they tried to
brag about their capabilities when
they were challenged to hack the
website of WikiLeaks in 2017. Overall, the group did not launch very
sophisticated attacks, and all the
attacks were detected very quickly.
Of note, since mid 2017, the group is
not active, and their website seems
to be under maintenance.

On January 22, 2020, the group
started to target social medias account (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram)
which combined have tens of millions of followers. they published the
message “Hi, we’re OurMine group.
We are here for 2 things: 1) Announce that we are back 2) Show
people that everything is hackable.

_DESCRIPTION
ATK13 is a Russian-speaking group
widely believed to be a Russian
state-sponsored organization.

ATK13
(aka: Turla, Uroburos, Waterbug,
Venomous Bear) is a cyber
espionage threat actor active since

In 2015, Kaspersky described
ATK13 as one of the “several elite
APT groups that have been using
— and abusing — satellite links to
manage their operations — most
often, their Command & Control
(C&C) infrastructure”. Indeed, while
APT C&C servers are regularly
taken down by authorities, satellite
connections hides the exact location of the servers. Satellite-based
Internet receivers can be located
anywhere within the area covered
by a satellite, and this is generally
quite large. To do that, the attacker
needs to pay an expensive connections (full duplex satellite links can
be very expensive: a simple duplex
1Mbit up/down satellite link may
cost up to $7000 per week) or hijack the network traffic between
the victim and the satellite operator that requires either exploitation
of the satellite provider itself, or of
another ISP on the way. The oldest
sample found by Kaspersky that
used a satellite connections has
been compiled in November 2007.

at least 2008, when it breached
the US Department of Defense.

Turla’s attack on one of Iran’s most
successful groups combines opportunism and international interests.
It should be recalled that since 2014
and the annexation of the Crimea,
Western pressures and the fall of
the oil price have plunged Russia
into recession. For this reason,
Russia has moved closer to Saudi Arabia, whose alliance with the
United States had weakened under the Obama era in the alder
of the Iranian nuclear agreement,

American diplomatic line since the
election of Donald Trump has not
diverted Saudi Arabia from this alliance. This rapprochement of interests is denounced by Iran, most
recently at the OPEC meeting in
Vienna in July 2019. The reason
for the tension is also economic
as both countries are positioning
themselves to address the European gas market.

Civil War in 2011. The group supports the current regime of Bashar
Al-Assad, and according to several
reports, it is actually part of it. In
the hight of the civil war, the group
launched
many
cyber-attacks,
usually against online platforms of
media outlets, in order to deface
them and spread their pro-Syrian
regime agenda. The attacks and
defacements were not just against
the official websites of the media
outlets, but also against their social media accounts and even their
registrar. In addition, the group is
known to use different types of
malware, usually against groups
and individuals that oppose Al-Assad’s regime. These malware are
of various types and usually have
advanced capabilities. In addtion,
they usually used spear-phishing as
their attack vector, but also other
techniques such as watering holes.
All of this indicates on the high professional level of its members and
their capabilities. Their attacks were
occasionally launched by affiliated
groups and hackers of the SEA,
such as Syrian Malware team, who
share infrastructure and personnel
with the SEA. Of note, in recent
years, cyber-attacks affiliated with
the group have become more and
more rare.
In October 2021, Facebook’s threat
disruption team took action against
hackers in Pakistan and Syria. They
specifically removed 3 Syrian hackers networks from the platform,
namely the SEA (APT-C-27, aka.
ATK132), APT-C-37 (aka. ATK85)
and a government-backed group
that targeted minority groups, activists, opposition, Kurdish journalists, activists, members of the
People’s Protection Units (YPG),
Syria Civil Defense and the White
Helmets. Note: SEA’s activity was
linked by Facebook to Syria’s Air
Force Intelligence in their latest
campaign.

_DESCRIPTION

Threat Actor_

Targeted Areas_

ATK15 - The group has a preference
for leveraging strategic web compromise (SWC) and scan-and-exploit techniques to compromise target systems.
The cyber-spies also used proprietary remote access tools in attacks observed since 2016, including SysUpdate and HyperBro. A
multi-stage malware, SysUpdate is
used exclusively by the group, being
delivered via multiple methods, including malicious Word documents
leveraging Dynamic Data Exchange
(DDE), manual deployment via stolen credentials, or via a redirect
from a strategic web compromise
(SWC).
Access to government resources
are abused to conduct their campaign attacks. The tools HyperBro
and shikata_ga_nai compressor
have been used in their recent campaigns. This group is known for their
strategic web compromises, relying
on whitelist to deliver payloads. The
group also has tendency to compromise Microsoft exchange servers.

ATK15
(Aka Emissary Panda) is a
cyber espionage group active since
at least 2009 (first spearphishing
spotted by TrendMicro on November
25, 2009), likely based in the Republic
of China.

_USED MALWARES

ATK168 - The group behind the
GandCrab ransomware was selling access for use in a program
partnership with a limited number
of accounts. In May 2019, the group
announced their retirement, which
coincided with the first appearance
of Revil / Sodinokibi in April of the
same year.

- GandCrab
- Sodinokibi

Revil is a Ransomware as a service ; (RaaS). In 2020, it is the
ransomware most often involved
in attacks. These not only consist
of encrypting the data that the victim can only recover for a ransom,
but in addition, the cybercriminals
blackmail the distribution of this
data.

_USED VULNERABILITIES
- CVE-2019-11510

_ATTACKS HAPPENED ON
> Continuous campaign using
the Sodinokibi ransomware
espionage campaign against
Israeli companies
Happened on: 2020-04-01

The main infection vector is a
phishing email that invites you to
download a compressed file, but
other techniques have been used
(such as in June 2021 a software
vulnerability of the company Kaseya). Several elements indicate a
Russian origin of this malware: the
program is instructed to suspend
its activity if it detects that the system language is Russian, and it is
for sale on Russian-speaking forums.
On 13 July 2021, REvil websites and
other infrastructure vanished from
the internet.
This group has been the source of
tensions between the newly elected
US President Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin, following the numerous
attacks suffered by the US from
Russia. Following the closure of the
group’s infrastructure, senior officials do not rule out the possibility
that the Russian government put
pressure on the group.

ATK17 - This group is known for
the diversity of the lures that it
uses in order to target its victims.
ATK17 is targeting foreign corporations with a vested interest in
Vietnam manufacturing, consumer
products, and hospitality sectors.
Furthermore, there are indications
that ATK17 actors are targeting peripheral network security and technology infrastructure corporations.
Furthermore to focused targeting
of the private sector with ties to
Vietnam, ATK17 has also targeted
foreign governments, as well as
Vietnamese dissidents and journalists since at least 2013. For instance, in 2017, social engineering
content in lures used by the actor
provided evidence that they were
likely used to target members of
the Vietnam diaspora in Australia
as well as government employees
in the Philippines.

Attackers group
_DESCRIPTION

Threat Actor_

ATK2 - They have the capability
to attack many organizations with
concurrently running campaigns.
They operate efficiently and move
quickly and methodically. Based
on these factors, the group would
need to be a sizeable organization
made up of between 50 and 100
individuals.

Targeted Areas_

ATK2
(aka: Aurora Panda) group
has been in operation since at least
2009 and is most likely a professional
organization that offers a “hackers
for hire” service.

The members of this group are experts at breaching systems. They
engage in a two-pronged strategy
of mass exploitation and pay-to-order targeted attacks for intellectual
property using two Trojans designed specifically for each purpose:

Much of the attack infrastructure
and tools used during these campaigns originate from network infrastructure in China. The ATK2
group makes regular use of zero-day exploits and has the ability
to rework and customize exploits
quickly. They are methodical in their
approach and they display a skillset
far in advance of some other attack
groups also operating in that region, such as the Comment Crew
(also known as APT1). The ATK2
group is an advanced persistent
threat that has been in operation
for at least four years and is brea-

_Team Naid distributes Trojan.
Naid, the Trojan found during the
Bit9 incident, which appears to be
reserved for more limited attacks
against high value targets. This Trojan was leveraged for a special operation during the VOHO campaign
and is probably used by a specific
team of highly skilled attackers within the group. This Trojan was also
found as part of “Operation Aurora”
in 2009.

king into some of the best-protected organizations in the world.
With a zero-day attack already under their belt in 2013, they continue
to operate at the leading edge of
targeted attacks.
Between January and March
2020, APT41 launched a large scan
attempting to exploit vulnerabilities in Citrix NetScaler/ADC, Cisco
routers, and Zoho ManageEngine
Desktop Central on a large number
of companies in many sectors and
countries. During these exploitation
attempt, APT41 only used publicly available malware such as Cobalt Strike and Meterpreter. These
tools were propably used as reconnaissance step before useing more
advanced custom malwares. This
campaign shows that the group is
ressourceful and can quickly leverage newly disclosed vulnerabilities.

ATK23 - This group is described
as a group having a relative lack
of complexity but they sucessfully
compromised their targets which
are mostly the defence contractors,
industrial campanies, shipbuilding companies, telecommunication operators and medias in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. This
group used spearphishing emails
exploiting CVE-2012-0158 and CVE2012-1856 or contains a web link
to Oracle Java exploits CVE-20130422 and CVE-2012-1723. It uses
already known and patched vulnerabilities. Its lure Word documents
contains pictures of a woman or
are related to political actuality.
This group also used HLP files abusing Windows features to drop its
malwares.
After the initial access, the group
list folder on the disk, IP configuration and information about the victim network. If the victim is interesting it deploys additional softwares
such as backdoor and lateral movement tools to dump password from
Windows, IE or Outlook and a legitimage RAR compressing tool. It
also try tool steal Windows address
books (.WAB files) and XSL, DOC
or HWP documents. The stolen
document are compressed and split
into multiple parts using WinRAR
or CABARC to be transfered to the
C2 server.
The lateral movement is done using
multiple tools to dump credential
from browsers or Outlook.
The C2 servers are hosted on shared
hosting plateforms and dedicated
hosting. Their C2 infrastructure is
very ephemeral. Icefog seems to
use a hit and run strategy. They
infects their victims, steal the data
and the C2 infrastructure expires in
a few months. This strategy indicates that they knew what they are
looking for. They did not maintain
a persistent presence on the compromised network when their goal
is reached.

nearly a year of silence, new variants of the ICEFOG (ICEFOG-M
and ICEFOF-P) have been found,
used during campaign which targets do not match with previously
seen campaign.
NB: According to the researcher
Chi-en Shen from FireEye, the new
variants of the ICEFOG backdoor
are used by multiple Chinese groups
(APT9, APT15, Goblin Panda and
another group name Temp Group
A which can actually be the original Icefog group). The conclusion
is that the ICEFOG backdoor cannot
be used to attribute a campaign.

_DESCRIPTION

_ATTACKS HAPPENED ON

ATK236 - (aka: TA551, GOLD CABIN, Shathak) is a financially-motivated threat group that has been
active since at least 2018 that uses
large-scale phishing campaigns to
deliver additional malware payloads.
IcedID and Valak were the predominant payloads we observed with
TA551 phishing campaigns in 2020.
The group has distributed different
malware families over time, but
consistently used password-protected ZIP archives containing
macro-enabled Office documents.
The group has primarily targeted
English, German, Italian, and Japanese speakers through emailbased malware distribution campaigns.
In September 2021, the group was
observed pushing Trickbot to the
infected hosts, which, in turns, delivered DarkVNC and Cobalt Strike
beacons.

ATK237 - The analysis of the
malware that makes up this
threat led to the name TETRADE
4 malware families, believing that
they are the result of a Brazilian
banking group / operation that is
evolving its capabilities by targeting
banking users abroad.

ATK237
A cyber group with a brazilian origin,
that was oriented until 2011 against its
compatriots before going international.
_Type of attacker: Cyber Criminal

New professionally executed, scalable and persistent operations,
creating various versions of the
malware, with significant infrastructure improvements that
allow cybercriminal groups from
different countries to collaborate.

The attacks seem to focus on the
Latin American victims although
casualties from all over the world
are possible, the banks being international.
Each campaign runs on its unique
identifier, which varies according
to the versions and Commands &

Brazilian cyber crime is prolific,
since then Android malware like
Ghimob has appeared, directly linked to GUILDMA. The tetrades are
just a small part of the threat from
Latin America.

It is impossible to know or recognize who are the groups or individuals behind its malware. It is
commonly accepted that there is a
community which, although competing, shares a lot of information
and infrastructures.

_ATTACKS HAPPENED ON
GUILDMA (aka Astaroth)
2015 : Spread primarily through
phishing emails disguised as legitimate business communications or
notifications. Acquisition of several
new evasion techniques, making it
difficult to detect.
2019 : malicious payload is hidden
in victim’s system with the help of
special file format.
Storage of its communication with
the control server in an encrypted
format on Facebook and YouTube
pages. Therefore difficulty in detecting communication traffic as
malicious and since no antivirus is
blocking either of these websites, it
ensures that the controlling server
can execute commands without interruption.

It focuses its efforts on evasion of
detection using modular installers.
The malware allows attackers to
conduct fraudulent banking transactions by using victims’ computers to bypass security measures
used by banking institutions.
JAVALI (aka Ousaban)
2017 : Uses multistage malware
and distributes its initial payload via
phishing emails, as an attachment
or link to a website. These emails
include an MSI (Microsoft Installer)
file with an embedded Visual Basic
Script that downloads the final malicious payload from a remote C2; it
also uses DLL sideloading and several layers of obfuscation to hide
its malicious activities from analysts and security solutions.

_DESCRIPTION
ATK241 - It seems that the group’s
shift in focus from mimicking a
criminal modus operandi with ransomware-like extortion campaigns
with data encryption to actually
using a wiper to destroy the target’s data.
This tactic of near luring by pretending to use one modus operandi
rather than another is not yet explained and is not common.
In all likelihood, the attacker must
be trying to buy time by hiding his
original intent behind a classic ransomware attack to have time to
erase all the data he wants from
his target.
The group is suspected of originating from Iran and of being a sponsored group. The link to Iran is argued by SentinelLabs under four
points:
• Firstly, the nature of the motivation and the modus operandi
using wipers echoes behaviour
observed in other groups suspected of being sponsored by the
Iranian state. The nature of the
targets is also reminiscent of the
geopolitical tension between Iran
and Israel. Another target located
in the United Arab Emirates had
already been targeted by Iranian
groups. It is a critical infrastructure facility of the Emirates.
• Secondly, some of the webshells
deployed by the group were modified versions of ASPXSpy. Three
of these variants were uploaded
to VirusTotal from Iran, the rest
from other Middle Eastern countries.
• Also, while the group regularly
uses public VPN providers (e.g.
ProtonVPN), it has used nonVPN nodes from servers linking
to Iranian domains in the past.
• Finally, Agrius uses the DEADWOOD wiper in its arsenal. This
software has been linked by some
sources to ATK35 (APT33), the
Shamoon operator. It seems
that Agrius and ATK35 share resources in this matter. This is because the variant used by Agrius
is an improvement of the original
software, which implies that the
group had access to the source
code of the latter or at least ex-

changed with the original developers. The use of DEADWOOD
came shortly after an attempt
by Agrius to use his personal wiper named Apostle. Apostle was
probably not fully operational at
the time of its deployment, which
prompted Agrius to use an equivalent from an outside source.

_DESCRIPTION

_USED MALWARES

ATK29 - Known for their attacks on
foreign maritime systems to extract
data necessary for the development
of Chinese navy skills, as well as for
its geostrategic use in the context
of the New Silk Roads project. This
group also campaigned against the
Cambodian government in the general elections of 29 June 2018.
The infrastructure used in this attack shares many similarities with
that used in campaigns against the
maritime domain. These similarities
allow us to reinforce the conclusions that link the group to these
two different campaigns and that
establish the Chinese origin of the
latter.
FireEye links the two groups TEMP.
Periscope and TEMP.Jumper definitively in a report published in March
2019. Since March 2019, there has
been a paradigm shift and a change
in the sectors targeted by the group.
Thus, while the group had mainly
targeted maritime companies in order to catch up with the Chinese
Navy, it is increasingly targeting
political organizations in Southeast
Asia. The purpose of these spying
actions is to support the Chinese
Silk Roads project on freight transport infrastructure projects.
ATK29 is a group whose campaigns
obey the Chinese needs for technological catch-up and Beijing’s
diplomatic ambitions. The group is
always very active, and is composed
of competent people. Its arsenal is
composed of many tools, which
are regularly changed. It is quite
reactive and has, in the past, used
security vulnerabilities only a few
days after their publication. Many
of the tools used by this group are
also used by other Chinese state
attackers, suggesting exchanges of
skills and tools between different
sections. In addition, the group
shared its infrastructure with another group of Chinese attackers,
Hellsing.
In January 2020, the group was
observed targeting Malaysian Government officials. The attack goal
was probably data exfiltration.

_A new relationship with the
United States?

2021

2020-08
Dream Job

It should be recalled that in February 2007 relations between the two
countries were due to be normalized following a bilateral agreement
signed in Beijing to record the closure of the Yongbyon power station.
However, one year after the agreement, North Korea announced the
reopening of this power station before firing a Unha-2 rocket which
was supposed to carry a communications satellite in April 2009.
However, according to military
security experts, it was a ballistic
missile. Since then, relations have
fluctuated between tension and
calm as North Korea under embargo is caught by the throat. In order
to calm its adversary, the United
States is providing food aid in exchange for a restraint effort. However, the aid is not enough, and North Korea has no other choice but
to repeat its pressure or to resort
to perilous barter. Therefore, for
decades, North Korea has been exchanging arms with countries such
as Syria, Iran, Congo, Myanmar,
Eritrea or Yemen in exchange for
food. The year 2018 is interesting
from this point of view, since the
paradigm of relations between the
United States and North Korea has
taken an unexpected turn.

Spring
Dream Job

After months of great tension
between Donald J. Trump and Kin
Jung Un, which caused the international community to fear a nuclear
incident, the North Korean leader

proposed to the American President
a meeting to discuss his country’s
military nuclearization. Prior to the
meeting on 12 June 2018, Kim Jung
Un redesigned the North Korean
army and said he wanted to maintain "the momentum of appeasement with the United States and
its willingness to eventually give up
its nuclear deterrent. The summit
resulted in a joint statement: Joint
Statement of President Donald J.
Trump of the United States of America and Chairman Kim Jong Un of
the Democratic People’s Republic
of Korea at the Singapore Summit.
Four main points emerged from
this statement.
First, the United States and North Korea are committed to establishing a new relationship in accordance with the desire of the people
of both countries for peace and
prosperity. Second, the two countries will join efforts to establish
a lasting and stable peace regime
on the Korean Peninsula. Thirdly,
by reaffirming the Panmunjeom
Declaration of 27 April 2018, North Korea is committed to working
towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Finally, the two States undertake to
recover the bodies of prisoners of
war and missing in action, including the immediate repatriation of
those already identified. The declaration also mentions that D.J. Trump undertakes to provide security
guarantees to North Korea in return.
_Cyber as a new strategic lever
for North Korean ambitions
How can we understand this turnaround in the geopolitical situation?
A potential answer: a new cyber
strategy.
North Korea is not to be outdone
in this respect. Already in December 2017, the peninsular state
had already distinguished itself with
the WannaCry malware affair. In a
quasi-joint statement, the United
States and Great Britain stated
that North Korea was behind this
massive attack, which affected almost 300,000 computers in 150
countries and caused billions of
dollars in damage. While no hard

evidence was provided, Thomas
Bossert, who is assisting the US
President, said that Australia, Canada and New Zealand shared the
same conclusions. The NCSC was
more specific in its statement,
saying that the North Korean piracy
group Lazarus was almost certainly behind the attack. In May 2017
the contaminated computers were
instantly locked down and users
were asked to pay a ransom in exchange for the restoration of their
data. Europol described the scale
of the attack as «unprecedented».
Already in 2014, North Korea had
attacked Sony Pictures. Due to
the scale of the damage, the U.S
received help from Microsoft and
Facebook to counter WannaCry.
Microsoft in a publication confirmed the statements of the British
NCSC and stated that «by working
with Facebook and other members
of the security community, we
have taken strong measures to
protect our customers and the Internet from ongoing attacks by an
advanced player in the persistent
threats known as ZINC also known
as the Lazarus Group». The attack,
while reaching known geopolitical
enemies such as Britain, whose
Health National Service (NHS) was
hit hard, also spread to states relatively close to North Korea such as
Russia. The country’s postal services were also severely disrupted.
_A cyber tool at the service
of the regime’s domestic and foreign policy
North Korea is using its cyber capabilities for two geopolitical purposes. First, as with the Sony and
WannaCry attacks, the country
is very simply targeting its classic
geopolitical enemies. In June 2018,
for example, North Korean hackers
targeted a South Korean think tank
specializing in national security issues. The hackers took advantage
of a zero-day to compromise the
organization’s website and insert a
backdoor for code injection. Earlier
in April 2018, Chinese state-sponsored hacking groups targeted Japanese defence companies to obtain information on Tokyo’s policy
towards North Korea. This information was likely shared. In May it was
the Google Play application that

group

was hacked. Compromised Android
applications, hosted on Google Play,
were stealing information from the
devices and allowing the insertion
of codes stealing photos, contact
lists and SMS messages.

Bureaus associated to the Reconnaissance General Bureau. The
Bureau 121 is the primary office tasked with cyber operations. It was
reorganized in September 2016 and
it is now composed of:

In addition to these direct attacks
or cyber-espionage actions of geopolitical origin, North Korea uses
cyber-espionage as a repercussion of geopolitical situations. As
we mentioned, the country has to
use barter to support itself and to
circumvent the Western embargo.
Cyber-attacks have become the
new tool of this North Korean policy of survival. In August 2018, the
Indian bank Cosmos was robbed of
13.5 million dollars by North Korean
hackers who, after penetrating the
structure’s banking system and
making thousands of unauthorized
ATM withdrawals, made several illegal money transfers via the SWIFT
financial network. The same technique was used, and the same
consequences were seen in April
2018 at a Central American online
casino with the aim of siphoning off
funds. Finally, although there are
many examples, as early as March
2018 the group of hackers in question targeted several major Turkish banks and government funding
agencies.

• Lab 110
It is the key cyber unit under the
RGB; it applies cyberattack techniques to conduct intelligence operations.

_What does Lazarus really mean?

• Unit 91
- focuses on cyberattack missions
targeting isolated networks, particularly on South Korea critical national infrastructure such as KHNP
and the ROK Ministry of National
Defense.
- stealing confidential information
and technology to develop weapons
of mass destruction.

The North Korean cyber threat
structure is unique. Several high-level groups exist with the characteristic of being dedicated to a specific function. However, all of these
groups are linked to the North
Korean military apparatus, in particular to Bureau 121 of the Reconnaissance General Bureau, which
leads most sources to amalgamate
them under a devoted name, Lazarus. Nevertheless, this concentration is detrimental to the analysis
insofar as the Lazarus prism leads
us to consider that only one group
pursues the motivations of APT,
cybercriminal, terrorist and hacktivist at the same time. We try as
much as possible to specify the Lazarus sub-groups for adequate intelligence.
AKT3 or Lazarus is not a single
Threat Group. It represents the Bureau 121 which is one of the eight
174

•Office 98
Primarily collects information on
North Korean defectors, organizations that support them, overseas
research institutes related to North
Korea, and university professors in
South Korea.
• Office 414
Gathers information on overseas
government agencies, public agencies, and private companies.
• Office 35
Office concentrated on developing
malware, researching and analyzing
vulnerabilities, exploits, and hacking
tools.
• Unit 180
Unit specialized in conducting cyber operations to steal foreign money from outside North Korea.

• 128 and 413 Liaison Office
Responsible of hacking foreign intelligence websites and train cyber
experts.
_The Bureau 121 conducted three
main types of operations:
• Cyber espionage: The Lazarus
Units conducted multiple cyber
espionage operations such as the
Kimsuki campaign and the Operation KHNP. These espionage
operations have different objectives like the tracking of North

Korean dissidents, the collection
of intellectual properties helping
the development of weapons of
mass destruction or political espionage.
• Cyber Terrorism: in 2013 North
Korea conducted disruptive attacks on South Korean media
and financial companies (Operation DarkSeoul) and was responsible for the Sony hack link
to the movie «The Interview» in
November 2014. These attacks
occured before the 2016 reorganization of the Bureau 121, that’s
why we can’t tell which Unit is
currently responsible of disruptive operations.
• Money theft: One of the mission
of the Bureau 121 is the collection
of liquidity to finance these cyber
activities and the DPKR itself. It
is done by spreading ransomware
like the infamous WannaCry
which collected $91.000 through
bank robbery. The cyber bank
robbery is done by infiltrating
the banking network to steal the
SWIFT credentials and use these
credentials to initiate transactions to an account controlled by
the attacker. The most known is
Bangladesh Central Bank Heist in
February 2016 allowing the theft
of $81m. This activity was carried
on by the Unit 180, which has similar objectives than the North
Korean threat group APT38 aka
Stardust Chollima or BlueNoroff.
_The Bureau 121 is supported by
other Units from the General Staff
Department
• The Operation Bureau
tasked to define cyber strategies
and plan operations.
• The
Command
Automation
Bureau
composed of three units:
- Responsible for malware development (seems redundant with the
Office 35)
- Unit 32: responsible for military
software development
- Unit 56: responsible for command
and control software development
• The Enemy Collapse Sabotage
Bureau
tasked with information and psychological warfare.

A cyber operation involves the interaction of these different teams.
For example, the Operation Bureau
defines an objective, the Office 35
finds a useable exploit, the Unit 31
develops the backdoor and the lure
documents with the help of the
Enemy Collapse Sabotage Bureau
to create efficient spear-phishing
document. The Unit 56 develops
C2 software and maintains a C2
infrastructure which will be used
by the Lab 110, Unit 180 or Unit 91
to achieve the objective. Due to
this configuration, it is expected to
find tools and infrastructure overlap between the different operation
units.

ATK32 - (aka: FIN7) is a financially motivated group that is active
since at least 2013, which primarily
targets the retail, hospitality and
restaurant sectors, mainly in the
U.S.. There are assumptions that
this is the same group as Carbanak, but it appears that these are
two separate groups using similar
tools, and therefore are currently
tracked separately. Its main goal
is to steal financial assets from
companies, such as debit cards, or
to get access to financial data or
computers of finance department
employees in order to conduct wire
transfers to offshore accounts. The
group’s often use phishing as their
main attack vector, including tailored spear-phishing campaigns.
In addition, the group used a front
company dubbed «Combi Security»,
purportedly headquartered in Russia and Israel, to provide a guise of
legitimacy and to recruit hackers to
join the criminal enterprise.

_DESCRIPTION
ATK33 - The attacks of this adversory are different from those seen
in untargeted or targeted attacks,
which makes it peculiar in many
ways. When part of the targeted
attacks can be qualified as opportunistic: This group will prefer to
modify their target profiles and
geographic attack zones based on
geopolitical events.
Thus, no target is immune in the
world. ATK33’s objective will be to
steal sensitive intellectual property
related to government interests,
The group has systematically targeted specific governments organizations, defense institutes, intelligence
agencies, diplomatic institutions
and telecommunications providers
in South and Southeast Asia. The
recurrent use of spear phishing
tactics (phishing attempts targeting
specific individuals) and access to
previously unknown zero-day exploits have made it a very resilient
threat.
For initial access it uses mainly
spear-phishing, we have also seen
the use of nuisance attacks against
vulnerable browser plugins. It uses
several zero-day exploits suggesting that this is a well-resourced
group. ATK33 is less prolific in the
field than ATK9 for example, but focuses on a small number per year
trying to hide its infections with
self-removing malware and using
one-shot delivery servers. It often
targets the private email accounts
of its victims and uses them to access the organization’s networks. It
uses custom developed tools which
are often updated to avoid detection. Its backdoors are configured
to operate during the victim’s working hours to hide network traffic
from legitimate traffic. Interestingly,
there is no code shared between
their different backdoors.
The CnC infrastructure is a mixture of registered domains and free
subdomains obtained through dynamic DNS providers. The group
uses compromised infrastructure
based in multiple countries.

2012

Used lure documents often address
controversial subjects to incite the
reader to open them.
Based on Microsoft’s investigations, here is a non-exhaustive list
of ATK33 characteristics.
• Implementation of several cyber
espionage campaigns since at
least 2009.
• Concentration on a small number of campaigns per year, which
reduces the risk of detection and
helps the group to remain unnoticed and focused longer.
• Targeting of governments and related organizations in South and
South East Asia. Using multiple
unpatched vulnerabilities in zero-day exploits against its victims.
• Main method: Spear phishing
Hiding its traces by automatic
removal of malicious components or by using single mode
server-side logic where remotely
hosted malicious components are
only allowed to load once.
• Harassment of its targets via
their unofficial or private email
accounts, to use them as a
springboard to the planned organization’s network.
• Use of malicious tools that are tailor-made and have the resources
to update these applications often
in order to avoid being detected.
• Configuring its backdoor malware
to restrict its activities to victims’
working hours, in an effort to disguise post-infection network activity from normal user traffic.
• Its espionage activity is not intended to achieve direct financial
gain, but rather uses stolen information for indirect economic
benefits.

Focusing on South Korean targets,
this group can be compared to Unit
91 which has similar objectives.
While from 2014 to 2017, ATK4
mainly targeted the South Korean
government, defense, its industrial
fabric and the media sector, ATK4
moved to more international targets with further attacks against
the Middle East, Japan and the
Vietnam. These new targets are all
tied to North Korean interests.
This group uses spear phishing,
strategic web compromises, or
torrent file sharing as an initial infection vector. From 2014 to 2017,
their decoy ducos were written in
Korean and related to a theme relating to the Korean Peninsula. It
uses various legitimate platforms
like C2 and has access to several
0-day vulnerabilities.
The group can integrate newly revealed vulnerabilities into their toolset. This can be explained with the
collaboration of different units within the North Korean General Reconnaissance Bureau.

ATK40 - The group targets as a
priority the financial institutions of
the Sunni Gulf States, but also the
United States and Israel, traditional geopolitical opponents of the
Republic of the Mullahs. During the
OilRig campaign in 2016 against
financial institutions in Saudi Arabia, the group demonstrated capabilities to adapt its procedures and
to use multiple delivery methods,
particularly through well-crafted
spear-phishing messages relevant
to the interests of targeted personnel and custom PowerShell implants like the Helminth backdoor.
He relies heavily on the human
factor for the initial access. After
the first report by FireEye and PaloAlto, the group has been actively
updating his tools and expanding
his scope of targets (Qatar, Turkey, Israel and United States). The
group continues to use communication through DNS Tunnelling to
the command and control server to
stay under the radar. In early 2017,
the group demonstrated the ability to use digitally signed malware
spread through fake websites (University of Oxford conference signup page and a job application website). PaloAlto observed an overlap
in C&C IP address used by OilRig
and used by Chafer for his Remexi
backdoor C&C, suggesting that
these groups are one entity or that
they share resources. Furthermore,
the similarity between the malware
ISMAgent used by OilRig and
ISMDoor used by GreenBug suggests a link between these groups.
This actor shows high capabilities
of adaptation, creating new custom
delivery documents and backdoor
and using multiple TTP to re-infect
previous targets who took actions
to counter their known TTP. We
did not observe this actor using a
zero-day exploit, but it quickly used
the CVE-2017-0199 and CVE-2017-

11882 which are widely used to improve the quality of his lure documents.
DragoS considers that ATK40
(OilRig) and ATK59 (Greenbug) are
the same threat group and carried
out initial preparations and network
intrusion in advance of the Shamoon event. This group test regularly its samples on anti-virus
testers like VirusTotal to determine
what content of their malwares are
detected. This technique helped to
build nearly undetected samples
but allowed researchers to follow
the modifications. In April 2019,
multiple OilRig tools were leaked on
a Github repository, including BONDUPDATER, the TwoFace WebShell and webmask, a tool linked to
DNSpionage. This leak was followed
in June 2019 by another about the
tool Jason.
OilRig infrastructure is continuously growing but overlaps with
previously used infrastructure. The
group reuses his tools, uses the
same attack protocols and has
a consistent victimology which
makes it easy to track down.

ATK5 - It is a skilled team which
has the capabilities to develop complex modular malwares and exploit
multiple zero-days. Their malwares are compiled with Russian language setting and during the Russian office working hours. Despite
number of public disclosure from
European governments and indictments from the U.S. Department of
Justice, this adversary continues to
launch operations targeting the political and defense sector in Europe
and Eurasia.
Between 2007 and 2014, ATK5 had
three kinds of targets:
- Georgian government agencies
(Ministry of Internal Affairs and
Ministry of Defense) or citizens
- Eastern European governments
- Security organisations
The attack of the Georgian Ministry
of Defense can be a response to
the growing U.S.-Georgian military
relationship. In 2013, the group targeted a journalist which is a way to
monitor public opinion, spread disinformations or identify dissident.
During 2015 and 2016, this group
activity increased significantly, with
numerous attacks against government departments and embassies
all over the world.
Among their most notable presumed targets are the American Democratic National Committee, the
German parliament and the French
television
network
TV5Monde.
ATK5 seems to have a special interest in Eastern Europe, where it
regularly targets individuals and organizations involved in geopolitics.
They also have been implicated in
the U.S. presidential election attacks in late 2016.
The 2016 attacks were visible and
disruptive but in 2017 the group
operated a great change to more
stealthy attacks to gather intelligence about a range of targets.

exploited no fewer than six zero-day
vulnerabilities. This high number of
zero-day exploits suggests significant resources available, either
because the group members have
the skills and time to find and
weaponize these vulnerabilities, or
because they have the budget to
purchase the exploits. In addition,
APT28 tries to profile its target
system to deploy only the needed
tools. This prevents researchers
from having access to their full
arsenal.

While some have
attributed this attacker to North
Korea, notably due to the overlap
between the group and ATK4, there
is a consensus linking this threat
actor to South Korea instead. This
actor targets government entities,
especially in the diplomatic, defense
and law enforcement sectors.

_DESCRIPTION

_ATTACKS HAPPENED ON

ATK52 - This Korean speaking
attacker is especially active in the
Sea of Japan and the East China
Sea. Its goal is espionage of specific individuals. The group possesses
extended cryptographic knowledge,
that allowed it to create fake certificates, a capacity to develop and
use 0-days (especially around Flash
Player). It also has access to an
extended network infrastructure
that is reliable, allowing the group
to maintain long-term access to
the system.

_DESCRIPTION

Targeted Areas_

ATK64 - Throughout 2016, these
actors used custom .NET downloaders to acquire basic system
information and download additional payloads to infect hosts. Based
on a generally low level of coding
complexity, CrowdStrike assesses
this adversary in terms of average
technical sophistication.

ATK64
A Pakistan-based adversary with
operations likely located in Karachi.
This adversary uses social engineering and spear phishing to target
Indian military and defense entities

“The CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence team tracking of this adversary began in late 2016, when evidence of an attack surfaced against
a victim based in India and working
in the hospitality sector. The attack
used an Excel spreadsheet containing macro code that deployed the
previously mentioned simplistic
.NET downloader payload. The basic nature of the malicious document and observed coding errors
in the downloader payload are the
basis for the assessment that this
actor demonstrates a low level of
technical skills.
MYTHIC LEOPARD was further observed in 2017 developing methods
for disguising custom malware implants. Two binder tools used to
disguise custom executables as legitimate Microsoft implants — were
discovered by Falcon Intelligence
and linked to MYTHIC LEOPARD in
July 2017.
Since April 2018, Falcon Intelligence has observed ongoing targeted intrusion activity using
malicious Microsoft Office Excel
documents likely associated with
the MYTHIC LEOPARD adversary.
As part of this campaign, the adversary leveraged generic themes
related to administrative, managerial or supervisory matters alongside a unique Visual Basic Script
(VBScript) technique used for installation. Falcon Intelligence has
observed MYTHIC LEOPARD using
this technique for several years
to install multiple first-stage implants and downloaders, including
the isqlmanager and Waizsar RAT
malware families. However, the use
of the UPX packer and timestomping techniques have not previously
been associated with this adversary
and likely indicates an incremental

increase in tradecraft and sophistication.
MYTHIC LEOPARD actors have
previously used an indigenously
produced .NET obfuscation tool to
hide malware implants as legitimate
tools. The malicious files visual_
HD.exe and skypee.exe both attempt
to impersonate a legitimate uTorrent executable once installed and
running. Both malicious files use a
previously identified MYTHIC LEOPARD command-and-control (C2)
domain msupdate.servehttp[.]com.
MYTHIC LEOPARD has previously
reused old C2 domains across medium to long periods of time, despite operational security concerns.
The related decoy document in this
attack simply displays a pay scale
without any further identifying information. However, the filename
(Pay Matrix Projected After 7th
CPC (3).xls) suggests that it is related to India 7th Central Pay Commission recommendations for government salaries. As noted above,
India is within the traditional target
scope for this adversary.”

ATK66 - Reportedly, the group was
established in 2011, but became active starting from 2014, when the
first attacks were detected in the
wild. By examining the group victims and its TTPs, it is apparent
the group mainly attacks targets
related to the Palestinian Authority. APT-C-23 members are native
Arabic speakers from the Middle
East. According to Kaspersky, at its
origins, APT-C-23 consisted of 30
members working in three teams
and operating mainly out of Palestinian Territories, Egypt and Turkey.

ATK7 - (aka: APT29, NOBELIUM,
UNC2452) is an attacker group
that exists since at least 2008
and that is believed to act for the
Russian government. The group
is composed of highy competent
members that are well organized,
allowing for complex and long-running campaigns. The group’s main
goal is espionage and intelligence
collection. The group therefore targets Western organizations, with a
special focus on governmental bodies, think tanks... It as also occasionally expanded its reach to governments in the Middle East, Asia,
Africa, etc. In order to reach its
goal, the group has used multiple
families of malware.
The group aims to act fast, albeit
in a noisy way: Their campaigns
are not designed in order to be
discrete, but to be distributed to a
large number of victims, followed
by deployment of a malware that
will quickly grab and exfiltrate every
potentially interesting information.
When a victim of interest has been
unmasked, the group will then often switch to a different, stealthier
malware, designed for long-term
persistence, in order to gather intelligence.
In recent years, the group has been
leading these campaigns bi-annually.
The group is suspected to be responsible for the 2015 hack of multiple governmental institutions in the
USA, including the White House,
the Pentagon and the DoS.
The threat actor behind the attacks against SolarWinds, the
SUNBURST backdoor, TEARDROP
malware, and related components.
They ran an election fraud themed
phishing campaign in mid-2021
which delivered a Cobalt Strike
beacon.
In the same year, they’ve also been
observed targeting an Israeli and an
Irianian embassy, the Indian gouvernment with maldoc delivering

multiple versions of the same Cobalt Strike beacon.
In 2022, the European government
and several diplomatic institutions
were targeted in the same way.

_DESCRIPTION

_ATTACKS HAPPENED ON

ATK73 - The group entered the
public spotlight following the 2017
hack of Larson Studios, and the
subsequent release of an entire season of the TV show “Orange is the
New Black”. “The Dark Overlord”
key business model is to hack into
low, medium and high-profile organizations, mostly in the healthcare,
education, and media production
sectors in the US and the UK, and
subsequently put the stolen data up
for sale or demand ransom from its
victims. The Dark Overlord appears
to primarily be a financially-driven
threat actor, with a proven history of success, and likely millions
of dollars in profits. The threat actor has been prevalently active on
Darknet marketplaces and hacking
forums, where he tries to sell “private” databases (databases that are
not in the public domain yet), but
also other goods, such as software
source code.

Thrip targets Southeast Asia

234

ATK78 - This group was uncovered in January 2018 by Symantec
during a campaign targeting an important telecommunication operator in Southern Asia.
The day of its publication, the article from Symantec described
five custom malwares: Rikamaru,
Catchamas, Mycicil, Spedear and
Syndicasec. But this article has
been modified, maybe due to a mistake, and nothing remains but the
Catchamas info stealer trojan. Because of these circumstances, the
information presented here is with
moderate confidence.

_Type of attacker: State Sponsored

Motivations_

_DESCRIPTION

During the last wave of attack,
which began in 2017, Thrip had targeted a satellite communications
operator. The attack group seemed
to be particularly interested in the
operational side of the company,
looking for and infecting computers
running software that monitors
and controls satellites. This suggests to us that Thrip’s motives go
beyond spying and may also include
disruption.
The group uses several Live off the
Land tools. It uses administrations
tools available on the compromised
machine to reach its goal. This
technique has multiple advantages:
- Reduced costs and development
time of an attack.
- The lack of custom malware
makes the intrusion difficult to
attribute.
- Usage of legitimate tools and legitimates protocol makes the detection of the intrusion difficult to
detect.
ATK78 uses PsExec, a legitimate
Microsoft Sysinternal for lateral
movement in the compromised
network. PsExec is used to install
the Catchamas trojan which allows
the adversary to steal information.
This malware is deployed on interesting compromised systems.
Symantec identified three computers based in China used to launch
the attack. Thrip targeted a telecommunication satellite operator.
It seemed to focus on systems executing the software used to control
the satellites. It is possible that the

objective was the perturbation besides the espionage. In the same
way, when the group targeted a
geospatial imaging organization, it
focuses on computers executing
the software "MapXtreme Geographic Information System", used
to develop geospatial applications,
Google Earth and Garmin imaging.
The group targeted three organizations from Southeast Asia in the
telecommunication sector and one
in the defense sector. The nature of
the attacks indicates that these organizations were targeted, not their
clients.

_USED TOOLS
- LogMeIn
- PowerShell
- PsExec
- WinSCP

_ATTACKS HAPPENED ON
> Thrip targets Southeast Asia
Happened on: 2018-01-01

Geographic targets and the kind
of targeted entities indicate a correlation with PRC interests in the
context of Sino-US tensions in the
China Sea especially with issues
of sovereignty around Spratly and
Paracel islands. This suggests a direct link between Thrip Group and
Chinese institutions.
The group therefore appears to act
based on a strategic framework defined by the Party, but also on immediate contextual indications. The
group’s nuisance capabilities and
usual targets make it formidable.
We draw attention on the fact that
we have chosen to treat only the
case of the Thrip group under the
ATK78, some sources also link it to
the aliases Lotus Blossom, Lotus
Panda, Spring Dragon. This state
of affairs stems from the high level of sharing that exists between
Chinese attackers and the structure of their cyber service leading
to confusion in their identification.

Suspected origin of the attacker_

ATK8 - The group has been discovered in March 2014 after the publication of a series of slides from
Edward Snowden. This group is
probably supported by a state-nation, considering the fact that it
uses advanced techniques but does
not seem to be financially motivated. Another more precise indication makes it possible to link
the group to France. For good reason, the name "Babar" given to the
group’s spyware echoes a strictly
French fictional character. Also,
the backdoor called "Tafacalou" has
a name whose meaning in Occitan
French regional language is translated as: "it’s gonna get hot".
While the group is not associated
to any campaign in particular, the
tool it uses have been in order to
target various organizations, notably in Syria, Iran and Malaysia.
“More broadly, the group deploys its
campaigns on a global scale with
some twenty countries concerned.”
The group mostly develops and
uses espionage tools, and the way
the malware are deployed to their
targets is mostly unknown, though
some documents containing zero-day exploits have been used.

ATK80
A threat actor which is active
since at least November 2014. This
group launched long-term attacks
against organizations in the Syrian
region using Android and Windows
malwares. Its objective is the theft
of sensitive information.

- The initial access techniques include the conception of fake websites helped by typosquatting
used to lead the user to download the malicious messaging app.
The group also used social media
like Facebook to induce users to
download the malicious softwares
from a specified link. 360 NetLab
reserchers assess that lure documents could be used to deliver the
payload through spear-phishing.

- Use of fake installation interface

Android RAT
The Android RAT is an application
pretending to be «ChatSecure»,
«WordActivation»,
«whatsappupdate_2017», and other common
chat office software. It incites the
user to activate Android Device
Manager to protect itself from
being easily uninstalled and hide its
icon to run in background. After
establishing a connection with the
C2 he wait for command and steal
data from WhatsApp, Viper and
other softwares. It has the ability
of recording, photographing, GPS
positioning, uploading contacts/call
records/sms/files, executing cloud
commands in xml format, etc.

_USED MALWARES

Windows RAT
This Windows RAT pretends to be
the Telegram chat application, using
strong phishing techniques (well
chosen icons, names, well made interfaces) with a fake installation interface to lead the user to install the
malware and, if needed, malicious
updates. It is created using .net and
has common backdoor abilities like
upload/download/create/move/delete/rename/run/zip/unzip files, get
process list and kill a process, take
and upload a screenshot or execute
a command.
VBS Backdoor
This group used a large number of
VBS scripts which are obfuscated.
These scripts have backdoor fonctionalities.
JS Backdoor
A JavaScript script able to create a
file or a script in the tmp directory
and run it, get a specified environment variable, executing a command and update itself.

_DESCRIPTION

Targeted Areas_

ATK86 - The group was using
very high level of Russian in their
phishing emails, and it was found
that some of the commands of
their tools were in Russian. However, along the years, the group has
shifted to attack banks all over the
world such as in East Asia, Europe
and more.

ATK86
A Cybercrime group that has been
active since the end of 2016, and that
has attacked mostly banks all over the
world. The group is believed to be from
Russia, because most of their attacks
(at least at the beginning), were directed against banks from Russia and
former Soviet Union countries.

Suspected origin
of the attacker_
Eastern Europe

The group is known for their sophisticated and profound attacks,
in which usually they take a long
period of time to study the potential victim, to maximize the attack against them. In most cases,
Spear-phishing emails were sent
to bank employees, while having
a malicious file attached to them.
This usually downloaded the Silence Trojan that has many capabilities of stealing data, downloading
additional tolls, track victims and
more. A few versions of the toll
were found, and it has shown that
the group is continuing to enhance
them. Furthermore, the group uses
malwares to attack ATMs specifically, such as Atmosphere. At the
begenning, the tools used to target ATM were developped by other
cyber criminals but the group is
currently using homemade tools.
Through this, the group was able
to steal millions of dollars in cash
along the years, mostly from banks
in Russia, and Eastern Europe.
Some IP addresses used during
theses attacks seems to be located
in France, mostly from the OVH
hoster.
In 2020 the group started to target Banks in Sub-Saharian Africa
and to threaten Australian banks of
DDoS attacks if they will not pay
large sums in Monero cryptocurrency.
According to Group-IB the Silence
group started to buy access from

TA505 to banks which correlate
with the diminution of spear-phishing attempt from Silence. TA505
seems to have sold at least the access to one European bank to Silence in end 2019.

ATK88 - (aka: FIN6) is a cybercrime group active since at least
2015, and focuses mostly on the
financial sector. Their claim to
fame is in attacking Point-of-Sales
and stealing credit card data from
them. Millions of cards were stolen
using this method in recent years,
and subsequently found to be sold
on the dark web. Furthermore, in
some cases, if they are unable to
steal this data, they move to target card-not-present (CNP) data.
They usually use specifically POS
malware, and their victims are from
companies that have many transactions. Therefore, most of their
activity is against victims in the US
and Europe. Of note, since mid2018, it was spotted that the group
has started to deploy ransomware
on non Ecommerce networks.
The group may also be part of attacks that deploy ransomware such
as Ryuk, LockerGoga and MegaCortex, again in likely partnership
with banking Trojan botnets, which
could be a further attempt to move
into new “markets” that do not rely
on the need to monetize credit card
data.

_DESCRIPTION

A particular international context

ATK91 - FireEye has awarded the
development of TRITON to a Muscovite research institute linked to
the Russian government. The attacker’s tools and TTPs indicate
that he has prepared to conduct
operations that can last several
years and require a long preparation. In the 2017 attack, the group
compromised the target’s network
almost a year before reaching the
SIS (Safety Instrument System).
During this period, priority seems
to have been given to safety operational. His lack of curiosity during
the operation may indicate that the
attacker is waiting for something
before acting visibly.

This initial attack on Saudi interests by a group whose origin appears to be Russian is taking place
in an unusual international context.
It should be recalled that since the
end of 2017, Russia and Saudi Arabia
have been moving closer together
on the diplomatic front. However, if
we look at the sector targeted, namely oil, we must remember that
since 2014 and the annexation of
Crimea, pressure from the West
on Russia has been added to the
fall in world oil prices, which has
plunged Russia into a recession. To
stimulate investment, the Kremlin
had to find capital and foreign exchange. For this reason, Russia
has moved closer to Saudi Arabia, whose alliance with the United
States had weakened under the
Obama era in the alder of the Iranian nuclear agreement, supported
by the former US President. On 1
January 2017, the two countries
decided to reduce oil production
volumes to 1.8 million barrels/day in
order to increase the price of black
gold. The attack on Triton at the
end of 2017 took place 9 months
later, when King Salman travelled
to Moscow (November 2017) to
prepare for the next OPEC+ meeting, which was supposed to lead
to a further reduction in production
after March 2018. Nevertheless, the
last 9 months have been marked
by two important events that have
redefined everyone’s interests. The
change in US position in favor of
Saudi Arabia during the Trump era
by denouncing the Iranian nuclear
agreement and the Gulf crisis of
June 2017, which increased tension between the Kingdom and its
Shiite alter ego, weakened relations
between Russia and the Saudis. After the meeting of the two leaders
and the attack on Saudi Arabia that
paralyzed its oil company, Triton
launched new attacks in 2018 in
the Middle East region and against
the United States. Good relations
between Saudi Arabia and Russia
were reconfirmed in the second
week of June 2018, when Saudi
Arabia and Russia agreed to stabilize oil prices at an average level
of 75 dollars per barrel, while King
Ben Salman and President Putin
were meeting in Moscow for ope-

Group description
Triton is a highly sophisticated
malware for manipulating the Industrial Control Systems (ICS) of
critical infrastructures discovered
at the end of 2017. It is difficult to
determine definitively the motivation
behind this campaign. According to
several observers, the main objective of the campaign was to test the
tools and refine the techniques.
It should be noted that according
to Dragos, the ATK91 (Xenotime)
group is probably one of the most
dangerous groups known to date,
since it attacks industrial security
systems almost exclusively with
destructive intent resulting in loss
of life. The Thales Cyber Threat Intelligence team shares this observation. Certainly, in its report of the
66 most dangerous attackers in
the world, the Centre for Technical Threat Analysis ranks the group
only 30th with a score of 59 out
of 100. This score means above
all that the group does not represent a global threat to date, as it
is extremely specialized and is not
yet operational to our knowledge.
However, the motivation and the
technical level reached by ATK91
(Xenotime), to compromise industrial control systems, makes it a
formidable attacker whose attacks
can have serious consequences
on the security of people and infrastructures.

ning the Football World Cup, which
took place on the 14th.
It should be noted that according
to Dragos, the Triton group (Xenotime) is undoubtedly one of the
most dangerous groups known to
date since it attacks industrial security systems almost exclusively
with destructive intent involving
loss of human life.
Kill Chain
At the end of 2017, an oil and gas
facility in Saudi Arabia experienced
downtime due to an infection with a
strain of malware capable of interfacing with the facility’s industrial
control systems. The malware was
targeted at Schneider’s Triconex
instrumented security system. Access to the system was achieved in
the classic way with phishing and
hacking of the ID by changing the
telephone number to receive the
SMS message giving the administrator password. The group then
compromised a system administrator workstation, after having laterally crossed the demilitarized zone
constituting the airlock between
the IT and OT network. The identifiers were then used to access and
compromise the SIS controllers.
The controllers were placed in Program Mode during their operation,
allowing the attackers to reprogram
them. The attackers stayed for almost a year in the Triconex system
engineering station. It was from this
starting point that they were able
to send a Trojan horse to infect the
memory of the SIS controllers via
a zero-day operation allowing a privilege upgrade. From that point on,
the attacker had complete control
of the plant. One year after the
intrusion, on June 3, 2017, ATK91
(Xenotime) went into attack mode.
Quickly, the procedure for securing
the petrochemical plant was triggered and the temperature and pressure began to drop. The machines
stopped in emergency. Two months
later, almost to the day, the same
phenomenon occurred, suggesting
a major cyber-attack.
It is believed that on the first attempt the group inadvertently shut
down the plant, as some controllers
shut themselves down when their

logic code failed a validation check.
The protocol attacked by the group
is proprietary, suggesting prior reverse engineering. In addition, the
development of the tool would require access to both hardware and
software that are difficult to acquire.
Such an attack requires a high level of technical knowledge and, although it is unlikely to be reproducible on a large scale, it shows that
the attacker is sufficiently capable
of attacking and potentially causing
physical damage to plants and industrial systems. The group would
be linked to the Central Scientific
Research Institute of Chemistry
and Mechanics in Moscow for the
following reasons:
- Personal links with that Institute,
- An IP address used by the attacker,
- Correspondence between business hours and working hours
in Moscow.
This institution studies ways to
protect
critical
infrastructure
and develops weapons and military equipment. The group has
been using test environments to
check the internal workings of its
malware since at least 2013. Other
intrusions by this attacker into the
Middle East were carried out at
undisclosed dates, focusing on oil
and gas companies until the end of
2018. It should be noted that the
group has also begun probing energy systems in the United States
and other countries.
Xenotime uses a dozen custom
and public tools to carry out its
attacks. The custom tools reimplement features of the public tools
by adding anti-detection methods.
These tools appear to be used during critical phases of the intrusion.
Attacks on industrial systems are
long (several months or years)
since they require learning how to
exploit the target’s industrial process and developing the appropriate
tools. The attack is therefore preceded by a discovery, learning and
preparation phase during which
the attacker will set up his attack
infrastructure. The infrastructure
uses VPS servers from international hosting providers (OVH or
UK-2 Limited), VPNs and Dynamic DNS allowing regular changes
of IP addresses. After penetrating
260

the target’s network, the attacker
needs to ensure persistent and
very discreet access throughout
the mission.
Xenotime therefore uses several
methods to hide its activities:
- Renaming files to make them appear legitimate (using Microsoft
Update file naming)
- Use of standard tools simulating
the activity of an administrator
(RDP, PsExec, WinRM)
- Editing legitimate Outlook Exchange files to open web access,
- Use of encrypted communication
for sending commands and programs
- Use of multiple subfolders rarely
used by users or programs,
- Regular cleaning of attack tools,
activity logs, temporary files after
use
- Changes to the dates contained
in the files (creation and modification dates)
- Use of VPN networks, allowing
to hide the IP address of the attacker
Malware persistence on compromised machines is achieved by
creating an Image File Execution
Options registry key or scheduled
tasks. After reaching the targeted
SIS controllers, the attacker focuses on deploying TRITON by limiting his activities to off-peak hours
to avoid being discovered. TRITON
then allows full control of these
systems.

as long as possible in the target’s
systems in order to increasingly
test his tool.
The case of this group shows that
the theory of security by darkness,
which consists in thinking that an
ICS/SCADA system is complex and
therefore secure, no longer holds.
The rise in the quality of attacker
groups, the generalization of protocols and the standardization of systems have changed the situation.

This modus operandi, largely based
on a concern for non-detection, allows us to draw two conclusions.
Firstly, this line of development is
typical of state-sponsored attackers. The latter do not wish to be
linked to offensive computer systems with a geo-strategic dimension and demand that the groups
finance the greatest possible discretion. In the present case, the
fact that the group is linked to a
national research institution and
that its modus operandi is devoted
to destruction reinforces this hypothesis. The second conclusion that
can be drawn from this emphasis
on concealment is that it confirms
the non-operational nature of the
attacker’s arsenal at the time of the
attack. The ambition is to remain

_UNDERSTANDING
THE CYBER THREAT
Billions are being lost due to the
rise of cyber attacks in the automotive industry. Industry experts
argue that there are several factors
that can cause cyber attacks to target this innovating sector. Over the
years, cyber attacks have evolved
and the emergence of highly autonomous vehicles in the automotive fleet has aroused the interest
of attackers in the cyber domain.
Today, if the research of vulnerabilities is focusing on this industry, it
indicates the importance and destructive potential of the forthcoming threat to the sector. In order
to protect vehicles from these malicious behaviors, it is imperative to
dive into the type of threats that
can affect a vehicle.

• IIn 2020, 77.8% of all incidents
were remote attacks and 89.9%
of the attacks were related to
vehicle’s communication channels
• Threats against vehicle data and
code account for 86.7% of all incidents
• There were 110 CVEs related to
the automotive industry, 33 in
2020 and 24 in 2019
• 40% of cyber activities against
vehicles resulted in car theft,
which makes it the category with
the greatest impact on mobility

_THE JEEP HACK (MILLER
AND VALASEK)
The Jeep hack is widely regarded as
a landmark event in the automotive industry’s understanding of the
cybersecurity challenges it faces. In
2015, two researchers, Miller and
Valasek exploited a vulnerability in
the CAN (controller area network)
bus of the Chrysler-manufactured
vehicle. The bus corresponds to the
car’s internal network. It oversees
the various components within the
vehicle such as the engine, sensors
and transmission. Taking control
of the CAN bus allowed them to

_THE MAIN ENTRY POINTS
FOR ATTACKERS

• In 2020, 55% of hacks were carried out by hackers to disrupt
business, steal property and demand ransom
• In 2020, 38.6% of hacks were
committed by hackers and researchers with 36% of incidents
in 2020 involving data and privacy breaches, and 28% of incidents involving theft or break-ins,
including in the context of an automotive bug bounty scheme

since in 2016, a team of Chinese
hackers managed to take control
of a Tesla Model S by creating a
Wi-Fi hotspot to which the car automatically connects if it is performing Web browsing. This allowed
them to access the CAN bus from
which they could send commands
and engage the brakes. By connecting physical device to internet, for

have created multiple entry points

_UNDERSTANDING
THE CYBER THREAT
The protection of airport IT systems is a major issue today and in
the very near future. Even a relatively minor bug can cause chaos,
resulting in flight delays and legal
action by disgruntled passengers.
The Delta Airlines computer system failure in 2016 is a good example of this phenomenon, as it
caused problems for hundreds of
thousands of people worldwide
who had their flights delayed or
cancelled. The threat to the airpo-

rt sector concerns simultaneously
the ground infrastructure, the aircraft and the passengers. Now, taking into account its destructive
potential, this particular threat has
emerged as a real concern for the
Aviation industry.

2020 aviation-related cyber-attacks
in 2020. In 2020, international
passenger traffic fell by 75.6% and
domestic traffic by 48.8%. However, as passenger traffic declined,
cyber attacks on the aviation sector are reported to have increased.

If serious incidents involving the
cyber-hijacking of an aircraft have
not been observed in the wild, tampering with airplane systems is a
source of concern for researchers.
In 2015, expert Chris Roberts claimed to the FBI that he had successfully penetrated multiple inflight entertainment systems and
was able to briefly change an aircraft’s direction. This case caught
the attention of the DHS (Department of Homeland Security), which
issued an alert recognizing the
potential for an attack on an airplane. In 2019, DHS released ano-

ther document highlighting that a
malicious threat actor with physical
access to a small aircraft would be
able to alter flight information via
the autopilot system. In addition,
exploiting vulnerabilities in satellite
communication technology (SATCOM) could be a vector for compromising in-flight communication
devices according to Sanatamarta’s research work.

plications like Telegram or Signal.
The main risk is that APT attackers
will take advantage of the influx of
WhatsApp users to Telegram or
Signal to expand their victim base
without users being aware of the
threat.
Several APT threat actors such as
ATK51 or ATK66 (APT-C-23) have
played a major role in attacks using
WhatsApp or even Telegram.
Furthermore, applications such as
Telegram can become a placeholder for the DarkWeb as shown by
the leak of several malware source
codes belonging to the ATK51 group
(MuddyWater). Indeed, a group calling itself «Green Leakers» used Telegram channels to sell ATK51 data.

becoming a new theatre of operations for organized cybercrime.

programming but has included a
wide range of internal information, including legal and research
resources. This gave them a very
clear picture of how these civil society groups operate.

_Civil Society
_UNDERSTANDING
THE CYBER THREAT
Civil society refers to non-profit,
citizen-based groups that are organized at the local, national or
international level. These groups
can take a variety of forms, ranging from unions and communities to think tanks and NGOs. The
very nature of their activities (often related to the political sphere)
coupled with limited budgets
(non-profit) to implement protective security measures make them
an enticing target for malicious
actors. This intuition is borne out
in the wild as civil society organizations and faces a dense cyber
threat landscape, both in terms of
numbers and variety of threat actors. From a hacker’s perspective,
the Civil Society represents a rich
environment as organizations process credit card data for donations
and may store personal information or even IP data.
_CYBERTHREAT LANDSCAPE:
NGOS AND CHARITIES
NGOs appear in many aspects as
the embodiment of the challenges faced by the Civil Society as
a whole. According to a survey
conducted by the Institute for Cri-

tical Infrastructures over NGOs
and NPOs, 50% of the respondents revealed they had been targeted by a ransomware and nearly
half (49%) admitted they did not
rely on a specific unit to deal with
cybersecurity issues. This gap can
be explained in part by the participatory funding of these organizations and the prioritization of
expenditures towards operational
needs.
Looking at charities, which are
critical in the civil society ecosystem, a few trends are worth noting. First, while many services
have gone digital, the rate of reporting cyberattacks has remained
steady. Just over one in four charities (26%) reported being the
target of a cyberattack in 2020,
and this trend seems to correlate
with the size of the organization,
as 68% of very high revenue charities recorded at least one cyber
incident. 80% of breaches involve
a phishing scheme.
_AN APPEALING TARGET FOR
STATE ACTORS
At 32%, NGOs represent the
largest sector targeted by nation-state
nefarious
activities,
ahead of professional services and

government organizations at only
13%. While both government agencies and politically oriented NGOs
collect public policy information,
the lack of safeguards encourages
threat actors to prioritize targeting the latter civil society organizations. In 2019, Microsoft observed 740 intrusion attempts from
nation-state actors targeting democracy-focused civil society organizations in the U.S.-including
political parties and think tanks involved in the election process. The
structure of American civil society
is interesting because organizations in this ecosystem are hailed
as major players in the national
political debate. This has prompted
adversaries of the United States
- namely China, Iran and Russia - to launch cyber operations
to retrieve any sensitive political
content that these organizations
may have. This includes projections on the leading policy issues
as well as staff and contact information.
Chinese-affiliated
actors
have
launched particularly aggressive
campaigns targeting U.S.-based
NGOs working on issues related
to human rights and democracy in China. In these campaigns,
the exfiltration of sensitive data

Philadeplhia Food Bank, the region’s largest
hunger relief organization, lost $1 million to a
business email compromise (BEC) scam. This
occurred while 5.6 million U.S. citizens were
dependent on food distributions due to COVID-19.

_MAIN THREAT VECTORS
• Spear-phishing: use of spoofed
email address to send malicious
URLS and ultimately gain credential access of employees
• CEO fraud: combines spear-phishing and identity theft to lure
naïve employees into making
money transfer. The associations Save the Children and
Roots for Peace both lost more
than $1 million following a CEO
fraud
_INTERFERENCES IN POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS
It is undeniable that political campaigns represent an opportunity
for attackers seeking to undermine

trust in the electoral process. As
such, democracy-based organizations face intensive malicious activity as election periods approach.
The 2016 U.S. and 2017 French
presidential elections were marked
by numerous cyberattacks, which
attempted to undermine Western
democracies. In 2016, two groups
of Russian hackers successfully
penetrated the U.S. Democratic
National Committee network and
exfiltrated sensitive emails in an
effort to support Donald Trump’s
candidacy.

Interestingly, cyber attacks against
civil society receive little attention
from leading CTI firms. This may
be due to the lack of financial resources for civil society to purchase threat intelligence. Therefore,
one should keep in mind that commercial threat reporting will tend
to focus on sectors that can afford
CTI services rather than segments
that cannot.

_UNDERSTANDING
THE CYBER THREAT
Schools and higher education institutions were among the most
popular targets in 2021. According
to Checkpoint, Education and Research was the industry most targeted by cyberattacks in 2021, with
organizations facing 1605 security

attacks per week. This figure represents a 75% year-on-year surge.
For
comparison,
cyberattacks
across all industries have increased
by 50% over the period. The reasons behind this growth appear
as both structural (valuable user
data, chronic under-appreciation of
cybersecurity), as well as cyclical
with the complex adaptation of pe-

dagogical methods to the COVID 19
pandemic. This combination of factors seems to explain why, despite
the sector facing major challenges
such as a lack of staff and a lack
of funding and resources, the prevalence of cyberattacks seems to
be increasing year after year, as
breaches in schools and higher
education are widely reported.

_OTHER MOTIVATION : USE
CASE SHED LIGHTS ON ESPIONAGE-DRIVEN PLAYERS

The NCSC (National Counterintelligence and Security Center) continues to respond to an increased
number of ransomware attacks affecting education establishments in
the UK, including schools, colleges,
and universities. Three reasons can
be put forward to explain the attractiveness of the sector for the
cybercriminal ecosystem.

As part of a campaign that begun
in April 2017, cyberattacks from
Chinese attacker groups have targeted U.S. universities in an effort
to collect military type intelligence.
The information sought was related
to underwater technology and although no public notice has been
issued, some institutions may have
been compromised. This demonstrates the value of academic research for states seeking information of strategic interest. Between
2013 and 2017, Iranian hackers had
already implemented a phishing
scam to recover the passwords of
hundreds of professors of American universities.

First, universities and educational
institutions hold valuable data that
can be mined. They have valuable
information about students and employees, namely medical records, PII
(personable identifiable information)
and financial information.
Second, their attack surface has
grown rapidly over the past two
years. Most companies are increasingly adopting new cloud and digital platforms, allowing them to
be much more effective than in
the past. Educational institutions
are no exception to this trend. Indeed, many had to react quickly to
challenging remote working conditions to add new capabilities for
engaging learners and storing files.
COVID 19 in that regard created
avenues for hackers to exploit remote systems. The limited budgets
of certain institutions and notably
pubic schools further contribute to
their vulnerability.
Third, paying ransom in the event
of computer systems being encrypted by ransomware often appears
to be the most viable option for organizations that cannot justify halting educational services.

_CYBERATTACKS WITH SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES
Far reaching consequences often
arise from cyberattacks on the
education and research industry.
The NSW Department of Education was hit by a cyberattack in
July 2021, provoking an utter paralysis of the education system. In
January 2022, Albuquerque Public
Schools district fell off to a cyberattack. The attack forced the superintendent Scott Elder to announce
the cancellation of classes for two
days in a row. This affected 75,000
students, or one in five school
children in New Mexico. Likewise, a
ransomware attack forced Howard
University to cancel classes and
shut down campus network in September 2021. Some organizations
turn to another solution, paying
the ransom, thus having to bear a
financial drop-off. The University of
California, San Francisco decided
to pay part of the ransom ($1,14 millions) demanded by the Netwalker
extortion group in order to decrypt
their system and recover their data.
In 2020, 77 individual cyber-extortion attacks affected nearly 1800
schools and resulted in $6.6 billions
of recovery costs alone.

Targeted sectors

_OTHER MOTIVATION : DISGRUNTLED EMPLOYEES/STUDENTS
With 20% of attacks being the
work of an internal actor, educational services are one of the sectors most affected by this threat.
It can result in DDoS attacks from
disgruntled students or staff. In
September 2015, the University of
London was affected by a DDoS
attack from an employee who was
targeting the senior executive responsible for his dismissal.
_FAMOUS RANSOMWARE
GANGS
Plenty of different behaviors are observed from ransomware operators
with regards to the education and
research industry. Some operators have an ethic chart preventing
them from infecting essential services such as government, healthcare organizations and education
institutions. Other operators do not
abide by those strict principles and
contemplate the sector as an easy
target. In March 2021, the FBI issued a FLASH, a document alerting
education institutions of the surge
of attacks directed at the sector by
the actor dubbed PYSA. The Grief
ransomware is another cyber-extortion actor targeting education
institutions. In May 2021, the group
stated it had exfiltrated 10 Gb of
personal and internal data belonging to a school district in Mississippi. Schools in Virginia and Washington state were also allegedly hit
by the Grief operators.

_UNDERSTANDING
THE CYBER THREAT
There are three characteristics
that make the sector particularly
vulnerable to contemporary cyber
threats:
• First, an increased number of
threats and actors targeting public services: state actors seeking
to cause security and economic
disruption, cyber criminals who
understand the economic value
represented by the sector, and
hacktivists seeking to publicly express their opposition to general
utility projects or programs
• Second,
the
extensive
and
growing attack surface of utilities,
resulting from their geographic
and organizational complexity, in-

cluding the decentralized nature
of many organizations’ cyber security leadership
• Finally, the electricity and gas
sector’s unique interdependencies between physical and cyber
infrastructure make companies
vulnerable to exploitation
_POWER LANDSCAPE
• The Power Sector is in transition.

Colonial Pipeline system map

In early May 2021, the Colonial Pipeline suffered a ransomware attack that forced it to shut down
its entire network to prevent the
malware from spreading.
Indeed, Colonial Pipeline, the largest oil pipeline in the United
States, halted its operations after
suffering what is believed to be a
ransomware attack. Colonial Pipeline transports refined petroleum
products between refineries on the
Gulf Coast and markets in the southern and eastern United States.
The company transports 2.5 million
barrels per day through its 5,500mile pipeline and supplies 45% of all
fuel consumed on the East Coast.

• Interestingly, the malware used by
Darkside does not seem to target
CIS (Community of Independent

good debugger and detection of
virtual environments. The sample
was found in multiple versions,
using multiple packers, which
may indicate that the attacker is
running tests. One uncommon
thing is that the URL of the data
is in the hardcoded ransom note,
which indicates that the malware
was compiled after the data was
stolen

• This difference tends to influencehackers to utilize the IT network
as an easier attack vector into OT

critical infrastructures show that
access to the control network
was gained by first compromising
the more exposed IT network

_Financial
_UNDERSTANDING
THE CYBER THREAT
Financial institutions are leading
targets of cyber attacks. Banks
are where the money is, and for
cybercriminals, attacking banks
offers multiple avenues for profit
through extortion, theft, and fraud.
Nation-states and hacktivists also
target the financial sector for political and ideological motivations. Regulators are taking notice, and implementing new controls for cyber
risk to address the growing threat
to the banks they supervise.
_WHO IS BEHIND
THE THREAT?
The malicious actors behind these
attacks include not only increasingly daring criminals, such as the
Carbanak group, which targeted
financial institutions to steal more
than $1 billion during 2013-18, but
also states and state-sponsored attackers (see table). North Korea, for
example, has stolen some $2 billion
from at least 38 countries in the
past five years.
Financial services companies are

well aware of the problem and are
working hard to combat cybercrime, but huge amounts of money are still being siphoned off every year by cybercriminals ($4.2B in
2020 according to the FBI).
State-sponsored adversaries may
attack the financial services sector to the extent that it disrupts
an activity essential to the functioning of a state. In 2020, New
Zealand stock exchange was halted
by a DDoS cyber attack, disrupting
during two days the cash and debt
market.
In summary, the motivations of
the attackers can be divided into
several categories: purely financial
(96%), espionage (3%) grudge (2%),
Fun (1%), ideology (1%).
_THE
TION

CYBERTHREAT

SITUA-

In the financial sector, in 51% of
those cases, the attackers succeeded in encrypting company data.
But 62% of victims said they were
able to restore fully from backups,
and only 25% paid a ransom, the
second lowest payment rate of all
industries surveyed, 7% below the
average.

In 2021, 44% of the breaches in
this vertical were caused by Internal actors (having seen a slow but
steady increase since 2017) (Figure
2). The majority of actions performed by these individuals are accidental actions, including sending
emails to the wrong people, which
account for 55% of all error-based
breaches (and 13% of all breaches
for the year).
_COST OF RANSOMWARE ATTACK IN FINANCIAL SECTOR
As shown in figure 3, healthcare,
energy and financials services and
pharmaceuticals experienced an
average total cost of a data breach
significantly higher than less regulated industries such as hospitality,
media and research. This can also
be explained by the value of the assets detained by financial services.
Indeed, bank account and credit
card number are high value commodities for cybercriminals looking
to monetize information on Dark
Web forums.

_LARGE-SCALE FRAUDS

than relying on stolen payment information in order to achieve fraudulent transaction. One player that
illustrates this trend is the Lazarus
Group. Affiliated to North Korea, the
group has pioneered the targeting of
SWIFT terminals. SWIF is a messaging network providing financial
institutions with a secure place to

_UNDERSTANDING
THE CYBER THREAT
For several years now, the strategic risks for the security of France,
Europe and, more generally, the
West, have changed in nature and
intensity. Today, the monopoly of
violence escapes the States and
war has become hybrid: civil and
interstate, internal and external,
material and immaterial. This observation applies particularly to cyber attacks. These transformations
are profoundly disrupting democracies, their values and their institutions. Many governments, particularly in Europe, have had to face a
much more dangerous cyber threat

targeting the very institutions of
those states and jeopardizing the
proper functioning of the targeted
governments.
_PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION
When it comes to governments,
it is necessarily appropriate to talk
about public administrations. By far
the biggest threat in this industry
is the social engineer. Actors who
can craft a credible phishing email

Military vulnerability to cyber attacks is a concern for obvious reasons: weapons are dangerous, and
those working in the military at this

level are the highest-ranking Defence staff who are most qualified
to protect the public. Yet, through
underinvestment, lack of awareness, rapid technological advancements in hacking software and any
number of factors, cyber attacks
on military weapons are an increasingly prevalent threat.
Indeed, many weapons or the systems that control them are vulnerable to some form of cyber attack.
These attacks can occur without
the military teams controlling the
weapons being aware of them.
These weaknesses have been referred to as ‘critical cyber vulnerabilities’. For five years, US Department
of Defense testers have routinely
discovered these vulnerabilities in
almost every weapon system under
development or in circulation.
This is made possible by a large
number of advanced weapons systems developed by private companies, which have factory-defined passwords on arrival. These
passwords have remained un-

changed, allowing them to be easily found online. Vulnerabilities
found in military systems included
the ability to turn a weapon on or
off, affect missile targeting, adjust
oxygen levels or manipulate what
controllers see on their computer
screens. All would be devastating in
a real combat operation and could
result in loss of life.
_LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES
As local governments and municipalities have gone increasingly digital and process more and more
data, they have become attractive
to cybercriminals. Indeed, these
local entities combine two central
elements that make them particularly appealing to malicious adversaries: the possession of high-value
data that can be used in identity
theft, including tax records that
compile PII, and the magnitude of
vulnerabilities that are the result of
these organizations’ underinvestment in their IT security due to fi-

nancial constraints. A 2020 study
showed that 97% of city employees
transfer sensitive documents via
their email boxes. Finally, the criticality of certain operations performed by local makes them prone
to paying ransomware to ensure
business continuity. In 2018, Iranian hackers launched a massive
ransomware attack against city
computer networks. The scale of
the incident created a disruption in
the operation of law enforcement,
court processing boxes, payment of
parking tickets and a halt in operations at Hartsfield-Jackson airport.
The city of Baltimore also fell victim to ransomware attacks in 2018
and 2019, causing server paralysis
and disruption to its 911 emergency call center. A coordinated ransomware attack also targeted 22
small towns in Texas, resulting in
ransom payments of hundreds of
thousands of dollars.

_COVID-19 AND THE HEALTH
SECTOR

_Health
_UNDERSTANDING
THE CYBER THREAT
Healthcare organizations are increasingly exposed to online attacks, threatening daily work and
compromising confidential patient
data. It has become apparent from
the many attacks that have occurred in recent years that healthcare
staff does not have the time or resources to minimally counter the
attacks. The potential disruption
caused by a complete overhaul of
online security is simply too great
for many organizations to even
consider. Despite the willingness of
governments to successfully limit
the number of attacks on critical
infrastructure, new threats continue to be discovered every day. The
high demand for patient information and often outdated systems
are among the many reasons why
the healthcare sector is now the
main target for online attacks.
_CYBERTHREAT SITUATION
Since 2019, the healthcare sector
has seen a shift from breaches
caused by internal actors to primarily external actors. It brings this
vertical in line with the long-term
trend seen by other industries.
While one of the primary concerns
in the healthcare industry remains
miscellaneous errors, with delivery
mistakes being the most common
incident (36% of human error),
these are not intentional in nature.
As a matter of fact, malicious insider breaches have not been among
the top three trends in the healthcare industry for several years.
While basic human error continues
to plague the healthcare industry,
organized cybercriminal groups
with a financial motivation continue to target it, with ransomware
deployment a preferred tactic.

Likewise, UHS (Universal Health
Services), which has 3.5 million
patients in 400 US and UK facilities, has faced major cyber attacks:
cybercriminals have used Ryuk.
This ransomware has recently
been used in numerous attacks
on healthcare systems around the
world. The sector’s attractiveness
to cyber criminals stems from the
information held by hospitals, namely PII (personally identifiable
information, medical records and
payment information.

is thus indirectly introducing, by
virtue of its exceptional nature in
all areas of everyday life, a great
deal of excitement in the world of
cyber security. This feverishness
has been identified by the cyber
threat ecosystem. This has been
particularly noticeable with many
institutions in the health sector
falling victim to numerous groups
of attackers:
• Hackers managed to penetrate the
system of one of the largest test
centres of Covid-19 in Antwerp,
Belgium. While its network was
still offline on Tuesday, the laboratory refused to pay the ransom
and filed a complaint.
• The European Medicines Agency
(EMA), which is responsible for
reviewing the dossiers of candidate vaccines, was hit by a cyber attack. Scientific data on the
Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the first
treatment on the market, was accessed by the criminals.
• On 15 September, the Paris Hospitals (AP-HP) reported that the
personal data of 1.4 million people
who had undergone Covid screening tests in the Ile-de-France region in mid-2020 had been stolen
during the summer. E-mail, telephone number, address, social

Six vulnerability points hackers target in hospital
cyberattacks
Networks
Without secure access
control, hackers can
infiltrate the network at
one point and then move
freely once inside.

Internet of Things
Connected medical
devices do not always
have built-in security
features.

Remote work
Remote COVID-19 testing
and vaccination sites as
well as more nonclinical
staff working from home
increases security risk.

Personal devices
The hospital network
becomes more vulnerable
to cyberattacks when
clinicians connect personal
devices.

Data storage
Ransomware attackers
can do more damage
when EHRs, payment and
insurance information are
stored in one place.

Records disposal
Improperly disposing
sensitive information can
lead to privacy breaches.

_THE INTERNET OF MEDICAL
THINGS (IOMT)
In order to improve efficiency and
performance, many hospitals are
equipped with connected devices
(15 to 20 in one hospital room on
average). Some of them, such as
ultrasound scanners and physiological monitors, are connected to
both the Internet and the hospital’s
computer network, thus providing
an entry point for an attacker. Internet of Things devices have many
intrinsic vulnerabilities, are rarely
protected by antivirus software and
are not regularly updated, which explain why they are exploited by malicious actors.

Technology

_UNDERSTANDING
THE CYBER THREAT
The high tech and IT sector’s relevance to economic, intelligence,
and security concerns likely make
it a target for a variety of threat
actors. The high-tech sector is often ground zero for cyberattacks.
One obvious reason is that these
organizations have very valuable information to steal. However, another more subtle reason is the very
nature of high-tech organizations.
High-tech companies generally
have a higher risk appetite than
their counterparts in other industries. In addition, they tend to be
early adopters of new technologies that are still maturing and are
therefore particularly vulnerable to
attacks and exploits. Parts of the
high-tech sector provide a path of
attack to other sectors, as hightech products are a key part of
the infrastructure for all kinds of
organizations. Technology is a key
enabler, but it can also be a key
source of vulnerability. For example, because of the tremendous
need to build trust on the Internet, attacks on certificate authorities have caused serious privacy
breaches in a number of industries.
In addition, vulnerabilities in pointof-sale systems have led to major security breaches for retailers,
and backdoors in communications
equipment have exposed organizations in all sectors to a wide range
of attacks.

_HIGH-TECH INDUSTRIES
HAVE BECOME A POPULAR
TARGET FOR CYBERCRIMINALS
The global technology market has
grown considerably in recent years.
According to the Forbes Global
2000 , the 184 technology companies on the list represent more
than $9 trillion in market value, $4
trillion in assets, and nearly $3 trillion in sales.
These high-tech organizations, as
well as those not on the top 2,000
list, come from a wide range of
sub-industries, from electronics

manufacturing and software development to digital media and space.
Although they apply their skills and
knowledge to different sectors,
high-tech organizations all have something in common: they operate
at the cutting edge of technology.
Innovation, secrecy, intellectual
property and, most importantly, security are imperative.

_Legal
_UNDERSTANDING
THE CYBER THREAT
Organizations in the Legal industry,
such as law firms, are increasingly
relying on IT for many of their critical operations. Besides, the very
nature of this industry makes them
prime candidates for ransomware
attacks, as they handle large volumes of sensitive data (confidential information related to mergers
and acquisitions, documents under
professional secrecy) that threat
actors perceive as valuable. This
combination of factors opens the
door to cyberattacks by groups
with primarily financial objectives.
_CYBER-EXTORTION AND
LEGAL SECTOR
The nature of cyber-extortion has
changed in recent years, from an
ecosystem dominated by the use of
ransomware as both a data encryption and ransom negotiation tool to
an environment where operators
use various blackmail techniques,
sometimes not even encrypting the
data. This new tactic, often referred as double-extortion reflects a

reality : for some companies, the
possibility of having their sensitive
data published is a greater risk than
having their servers paralyzed. This
observation applies to companies in
the legal sector for two main reasons.
First, a law company whose name
and sensitive documents were
leaked by a cyber-extortion gang
will suffer from reputational damage as clients will move away
from the firm. A law company loses
on average 5% of their clients after
a data breach.
Second, for European firms, the
provisions of the GDPR (General
Data Protection Regulation) provides for fines up to 4% of the company’s turnover in case of dissemination of confidential content.
Despite the uncertainty of negotiating with cybercriminals, those elements may explain why some law
firms decide to pay the ransom.

_EVOLUTION OF THE RANSOMWARE THREAT
Cybersecurity researchers at Digital Shadows reported the compromise of 18 legal services organizations at the end of 2020 and
32 in the first quarter of 2021, an
increase of 78%.
From Q1 2020 to Q1 2021, ransomware attacks targeting the legal
services sector increased by 967%,
from 3 reported organizations to
32.
In a survey conducted in April 2021,
with the participation of 1,263 professionals from different countries,
50% of legal businesses were forced
to lay off employees after falling to
a ransomware attack. It accounts
for the highest rate across all industries, followed by Retail (48%)
and Automotive (42%).

_Manufacturing
_UNDERSTANDING
THE CYBER THREAT
The manufacturing sector, due
to the nature of its activities, has
long been kept away from the prerogatives of protecting computer systems. The reason for this
is twofold: first, manufacturing
companies have long been able to
operate disconnected from the Internet and second, the general perception was that hackers were not
interested in the information and
assets owned by manufacturing
organizations. The emergence of
Industry 4.0 and the need for manufacturing companies to connect
their industrial control systems
(ICS) to the Internet has challenged
this paradigm. Thus, the novelty of
the emergence of network protection issues for these companies is
accompanied by a gap compared to
other sectors. This multiplies the
opportunities for intrusion by malicious actors, which can leverage
Intellectual property (IP) assets in
order to generate income.
_THE STATE OF THE THREAT
IN THE MIDST OF COVID 19
The manufacturing sector was particularly affected by the global COVID19 pandemic and continues its
rise among the sectors most affected by cyberattacks. According to
the 2021 Global Threat Intelligence
Report (GTIR), the sector has become the second most impacted
by cyberattacks, behind finance

and insurance, with a rise of 300%
in a year (2020 to 2021). A study
conducted by Deloitte also shows
that nearly 40% of manufacturing
companies have suffered a cyber
attack this year and that among
these companies, 38% have experienced a loss of over 1 million dollars. Critical manufacturing firms
involved in the vaccine cold chain
were targeted by a phishing campaign in a larger effort to gain access to sensible information pertaining to the COVID 19 vaccine.
_THE MOST COMMON
THREATS FOR MANUFACTURING COMPANIES
Phishing and Ransomware seem
to be the most common types of
threats targeting companies operating in the manufacturing sector.
Phishing techniques (represent
75.4% of social engineering attacks

conducted for this sector) are the
most common vector used to gain
initial access along with the use of
stolen credentials. The lack of preparation of the sector explains the
vulnerability of the industry to phishing attacks.
Ransomware operators and more
broadly cyber-extortion actors target heavily the manufacturing companies. Figures show that 92% of
the attackers targeting the sector
are financially motivated. Manufacturing companies have a particular incentive to pay large ransoms
insofar as a downtime would be
detrimental to their activity. As a
result the cost-effective option is
often the payment of the ransom.
In 2021, the manufacturing industry is the sector most represented
among cyber-extortion victims,
with more than 350 enterprises in
the ransomware leaks for the year.

_OTHER COMMON THREATS
• Manufacturing ranks 5th among
sectors with the highest risk
of internal threat. Employees
working in the sector are often
untrained and thus considered as
weak links that can be leveraged
by hackers. Malicious insiders are
also common in manufacturing
organizations, whether they are
after a fincancial or personnal objective.
• Manufacturing companies represent 22% of cyber espionage victims according to Verizon. This figure demonstrate the importance
of Intellectual property as a valuable asset that can be levergaed
by cyber attackers.

_REVIL’S ATTACK ON JBS
FOODS
June, 1, 2021, The meat supplier
JBS fell victim to a cyberattack by
the group REvil that affected the
company’s production activities in
several countries. This attack led
to a paralysis of servers, leading
to the suspension of production
lines, particularly in Australia and
the United States, where several
slaughterhouses suspended their
activities. This attack is a landmark
for the manufacturing industry as
JBS supplies almost a quarter of
the world’s meat. This incident resulted in a $11 million ransom being
payed to REvil’s operators.

_MANUFACTURING SECTOR
AND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURES
The critical manufacturing sector
is particularly at risk of being targeted by malicious actors. In December 2021, the CISA released a
report tackling the issue and providing insights on the evolution of
the cyberthreat for this sector. In
particular, the CISA has identified
vulnerabilities in ICS (Industrial
Control Systems) that are even
more crucial with the COVID pandemic forcing companies to adapt
to remote working. Managing cybersecurity risks has become more
complex, as companies are incited
to resort to process automation.
ICS play a key role in the securization of critical infrastructure, notably with regards to energy-related
infrastructure.

_UNDERSTANDING
THE CYBER THREAT
With 80% of world trade by volume
and 70% by value, the shipping industry is at the heart of the various
supply chains, making its operation
critical at the economic and strategic level. The sector’s need for efficiency has driven the maritime industry to increasingly integrate IT
systems into existing OT systems,
whose limited connectivity had
reduced the risk of intrusion for
many years. Today, the increasing
digitalization of the maritime sector induces a significant cyber risk
on ports, communication channels

them.
_INTERWOVEN OT/IT SYSTEMS
The explosion in the trade of goods
by sea, the increase in carrier capacity, and industrial digitization have
increased the complexity of the
maritime industry environment.
Operational needs for competitive-

ness have pushed ships and ports
towards automation of systems and
integration of IT with OT. Yet, by
connecting these two models, the
maritime industry has expanded
the surface, while neglecting cybersecurity investments.
The COVID 19 pandemic by inducing travel restrictions forced original equipment manufacturers
(OEMs) to connect standalone systems to the internet, making them
vulnerable. These OEMs have also
asked port personnel to establish brief connections between the
terrestrial network and their OT
system in order to perform security updates. These connections,
by creating entry points, expose
already permeable OT systems.

The blocking of the Suez Canal by
the Ever Given cargo ship symbolizes the potential damage of a cyber attack on a ship’s navigation
system, resulting in the daily loss
of $10 billion in trade. While an intrusion on the IT system can result
in financial losses as well as reputational damage, the compromise
of the OT system can have consequences on the physical safety of a
ship and its crew. By taking control
of a ship containing sensitive products (vaccines, liquid energy supply), an attacker has a major destructive potential that may appeal
to certain malicious actors.

The first half of the year 2020,
marked by the COVID-19 pandemic,
has exponentially increased the cyber risk on maritime transport. In
fact, over this period, attempted attacks increased by 400%. Over the

THE CYBER THREAT
In December 2015, the online video
gaming distribution platform Steam
revealed that 77,000 of its gamer
accounts were hacked every month. Steam has leveraged the increased digitalization of the industry to establish itself as a key
player. This very digitalization appears as a reason for the growing
interest of cyber attackers towards
the media and entertainment sector, which has been characterized
by a constant underappreciation of
cyber risks. The multiple companies
affecetd by attacks and the growing
concern with regards to the security of Iot devices did not help move
the needle and companies in the
sector continue to suffer from IP
theft andreputation damage.
_2014: THE SONY’S HACK
On November 24, 2014, Sony’s
employees realized their corporate
network had been hacked by a
group calling itself The Guardians

displayed on their computers (figure

days later, torrent links of unreleased Sony’s movies and confidential information about employees
are leaked. This attack, supposedly
operated by a North Korean group
stands out as a landmark for the
media and entertainment industry,
alerting the sector about the risks
of neglecting cybersecurity.
_INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS
A VALUABLE ASSET
Copyrighted material is an important resource in the media and
entertainment industry. Many cybercriminals have realized the value
of these assets and have started
to target this industry in a double

encryption put pressure on companies, but the exfiltration of such
information and the threat of its
release serves as an additional
blackmail technique. Indeed, the

risk that a media company cannot
afford to take. This logic is leveraged by cyber attackers specifically targeting the sector. The average
cost related to data breach for the
entertainment industry stands at
$4.8 millions.

High visibility as well as valuable
assets that can be leveraged are
enough to prompt different players
to express an interest in the sector. First, the airing of audiovisual
content may spark political controversies. 2014’s Sony Hack is widely
believed to be the work of a North
Korean APT group responding to
Sony’s release of “The Interview”,
a comedy movie staging the assassination of the north Korean lea-

der Kim Jong-un. State-sponsored
gangs may also target the industry in a larger effort to destabilize
a political adversary and excert influence. This motive is exemplified
by the hack of TV5 Monde in April
2015. Hacktimism is another reason for the targeting of this sector.
Indeed, individuals or groups of individuals may try to retrieve email
correspondence or personal information belonging to celebrities in
order to generate buzz. The most
crucial threat to the sector remains financially motivated actors.

decentralization of the model and
the intrinsic vulnerabilities of companies working in the media and
entertainment sector.

In U.S. Broadband Households

Third-party compromise is a classic
tactic that is particularly applicable
to the industry as media production
models are built on a decentralized
supply chain. Film directors, for
example, delegate specific tasks
such as editing, stunts, or art design to subcontractors, thus multiplying the entry points for an agile
attacker. The leak of several episodes of Netflix’s series Orange is
The New Black in April 2017 exemplifies this tendency as the hack
originated from the compromise of
a third-party entrepreneur working
for the show.

_RETAIL SAW THE HIGHEST
LEVEL OF RANSOMWARE
ATTACK

_Retail

Looking at the prevalence of ransomware across all the sectors
surveyed, retail, along with educa-

tion, experienced the highest level
of ransomware attacks: 44% of respondents in these sectors reported
being hit compared to the global
average of 37%.
Globally across all sectors, the
percentage of organizations hit by

ransomware in the last year has
dropped considerably from last
year, when 51% admitted being hit.
This drop can be partly explained
by the evolution of attackers behaviors.

_UNDERSTANDING
THE CYBER THREAT
The Retail industry continues to be
a target for financially motivated
criminals looking to cash in on the
combination of payment cards and
personal information. Social tactics
include pretexting and phishing,
with the former commonly resulting in fraudulent money transfers.
Retail is one of the most targeted
sectors for cyber-attacks in 2021.
The coronavirus pandemic has
forced retailers to adapt to survive, regardless of their size. While
smaller retailers have moved to
card payments and online operations, larger retailers have focused
on harnessing big data to achieve
efficiencies and maximize profit
margins.
This has introduced new threat
vectors as retailers’ attack surfaces
have expanded, and these vectors
are being exploited by cybercriminals keen to steal money and confidential financial information. Data
is the new currency for cybercriminals, who focus not just on money and goods but also customers’
personal data that can be stolen
and sold online. And with high staff
turnover and seasonal workers, retailers face threats from not just
cybercriminals, but also insiders.

Of the 357 respondents across all
sectors who reported that their organization paid the ransom, 282
also shared the exact amount paid,
including 36 in the retail sector.
Globally across all sectors, the average ransom payment was $170,404.
However, in retail, the average ransom payment was almost $23,000
lower, coming in at $147,811.
_RETAIL SECTOR AND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE
Many companies in the retail sector
are considered critical infrastructure. That is the case of the New
Cooperative, a US based merchant
wholesaler, hit by BlackMatter in
September 2021.
The attack was first discovered after a sample of the ransomware
was downloaded from a public
malware analysis site.
This sample provided access to
the BlackMatter ransom note, the
ransomware negotiation page and
a non-public data leak page containing screenshots of allegedly stolen
data.
Indeed, it is important to show
through this attack that when
the BlackMatter ransomware first
appeared, the attackers stated
that they would not target critical infrastructure facilities (nuclear
power plants, power plants, water
treatment facilities).
From screenshots of the trading
page shared on Twitter, the New
Cooperative asked BlackMatter
why they were attacked as they are
considered critical infrastructure
and the attack would lead to a disruption in the food supply for grain,
pork and chicken.
BlackMatter responded that they
did not «fall under the rules» and
threatened to double the ransom
if the New Cooperative did not
change its approach to the negotiation.

_VULNERABILITIES IN SPACE
SYSTEMS

Satellites are increasingly providing
essential services. They have become an essential element for the
successful accomplishment of military missions.
Nevertheless, for a number of
years, and especially with the onset
of the New Space, the issue of cybersecurity in space systems has
been sidelined, if not completely
ignored. The reasoning was that
since cyber attack techniques were
not as developed as they are today,
the functional and budgetary priority was not necessarily allocated
to the issue of cyber security.

The Space industry is organized
around several segments:
• Ground Segment
• Link Segment
• User Segment
• Space Segment

_SPACE SEGMENT
Once in orbit, a satellite has limited
physical contact with humans, although this does not mean that
security threats are not present.
Vulnerabilities in the software and
hardware used the satellite can
arise and impact the operation of
the satellite and the robustness of
security controls

_GROUND SYSTEM

_USER SEGMENT

Compromising the ground station
is ultimately the easiest way to
control a satellite because it provides the equipment and software
to legitimately control and track it.
Besides, it uses existing and established ground systems and attack
vectors. The types of threats are
generally the same throughout the
life cycle of a satellite.

Compared to the Link Segment
which corresponds to the interactions between the three segments,
the User Segment deals with the
applications of satellite systems.
Applications such as navigation, television and communications often

When we talk about threats to the
space sector it is first important
to recall the different dimensions
of the threat surface created by
the sector’s morphology. In reality
4 segments are to be identified:
space, ground, link, and user.
In the following section, we will
provide examples to explain the
ways in which attackers have found
to target these specific segments.
These examples focus mainly on
use cases of state-sponsored attacker groups, but they should not
suggest that organized cybercriminal gangs are not capable of acting
on these threat surfaces.

Living Off the Land tactic

_LINK SEGMENT AND ATK13’S
ATTACK EXAMPLE
The main advantage for an espionage group to leverage the Link
segment is that it is difficult to
identify. Indeed, the geographical
location of the C&C server is very
difficult to trace with this tactic

since Internet-based satellite receivers can be located anywhere
in the area covered by the satellite.
The only drawback is the instability
of the connection and its slowness.
In this case ATK13 used a very
simple method: Hijacking of DVB-S
satellite links.
The question is, how is this possible? As Kaspersky reminds us,
four basic elements are necessary:

• A satellite dish – the size depends
on geographical position and satellite,
• A low-noise block downconverter
(LNB),
• A dedicated DVB-S tuner (PCIe
card)
• A PC, preferably running Linux

_GROUND SEGMENT AND
ATK78’S ATTACK EXAMPLE
In January 2018, Symantec’s Targeted Attack Analytics TAA issued
an alert for a major telecom operator in South-East Asia. The alert
was linked to an attack by a group
called Thrip, which collects information on satellite-operating infrastructure.
To date, known targets are satellite operators in the USA and
South-East Asia but also defence
contractors, telecom operators and
organizations processing satellite
imagery. In particular, the group
looks for information linked to satellite operations and geospatial
imagery.
Thrip’s tactics are referred to here
as ‘living off the land’ and employ
legitimate tools often already installed on its victims’ computers
with some scripting and shell code
that is hardly visible. It is therefore
a dualisation of legitimate tools
used by satellite operators on the
ground for strategic and economic
espionage.

_USER SEGMENT: DATA
SPOOFING TO LURE THE
USER
There are many ways to spoof a
GPS satellite. One way is to compromise the satellite’s receiver and
alter its output signal. In 2017, the
U.S. Maritime Administration reported the first GPS spoofing attack against over 20 ships in
the Black Sea. Correspondence
between one of the impacted vessels and their command center indicates that over the course of the
attack, the GPS position displayed
on their navigation tool sometimes
showed ‘lost GPS fixing position’.
At one point during the attack, the
spoofed location showed the ship
was located near the Gelendzhik
airport but was in fact 25 nautical
miles from the reported location.
According to a non-profit organization called Resilient Navigation and
Timing, which monitors GPS inci-

dents, anecdotal spoofing reports
are not uncommon in Russian waters.
_SPACE SEGMENT: THE RISK
OF TAKEOVER
Attacks on the satellites themselves are less common in recent
times. Nevertheless, most of the
typologies of attacks described
above (living off the land tactic,
links hijacking, GPS Spoofing/Jamming, etc.) can be means to reach
the space segment as a final target.
Here, the most important risk is a
takeover or an OT attack on a satellite. In 2008 in a scientific article
by Jessica A. Steinberger reported

on a Trojan horse attack that allowed hackers to break into the
computer system of the Johnson
Space Center in Houston, Texas.
With this access they managed
to reach the International Space
Station (ISS) and disrupt on-board
operations. This use case, which
seemed unthinkable, was facilitated
using old software on board with
an almost non-existent patching
policy for vulnerabilities.

Wireless network connectivity is making railroads
easy target for hackers

_Transportation
_UNDERSTANDING
THE CYBER THREAT
In the age of automation and
networking, recent years have seen
an overwhelming increase in cyber
attacks against the transport industry. As a result of the proliferation of attackers and their modus
operandi, IT systems are often too
vulnerable. As a result, attackers
are finding more and more entry
points into increasingly vulnerable
systems. In addition, in 2020, a
number of global events have favoured attacks against this sector
of activity, such as the COVID-19
pandemic. Indeed, in this period of
coronavirus, attacking those in the
second line unfortunately makes
sense for malicious individuals. The
transport and logistics sector fulfils
vital missions and therefore needs

more than ever to have fully operational information systems.
It is important to know that the
transport sector is made up of six
sub-sectors: public transport and
passenger rail, pipeline systems,
road and highway transport, the
maritime transport system, rail
freight, and postal and maritime
transport. The vitality of the sector’s interconnectedness and global
presence makes it a tempting target for hackers.
_WHERE THE WEAKNESSES
ARE: THE RAIL INDUSTRY
In the rail industry, traditional wirebased train control and management systems (TCMS), which had
only limited communication with
external systems, are giving way
to wireless standards like GSMRailway, a relatively broad network
linking trains to railway regulation
control centers. As is the case for

all mobility providers these days,
T&L companies use vehicle infotainment services and other equipment that add another layer of internet-connected communications.
_WHERE THE WEAKNESSES
ARE: THE MARITIME SECTOR
In every segment of the transportation industry, the widened cyber-attack surface is evident. For
instance, among maritime companies, relatively simple distressand-safety systems have been replaced by full-fledged, cloud-based,
local area networks, like the International Maritime Organization’s
(IMO) e-navigation program. These
networks are a tempting target for
hackers because they collect, integrate, and analyze on-board information continuously to track ships’
locations, cargo details, maintenance issues, and a host of oceanic
environmental considerations.

_THE IMPACT OF CYBERCRIME IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR

• Blocked access to computer
systems, resulting in employees
using personal devices for work.

The fallout from cyber attacks can
sometimes be felt by organizations
for many months.
In addition to service interruptions,
cybercrime can also impact daily
operations and result in the exposure of sensitive data.
• Below are sample impacts of cyber attacks in the transportation
sector:
• Disruption to traffic lights, toll
booths and electronic traffic signs
• Interruption of ticket machines
and fare gates
• Blocked access to important files
and data
• Theft of sensitive information
from emails
• Interruption of payroll services
• Theft of personally identifiable information (“PII”)

_TRANSPORTATION CYBERATTACKS CAN BE DEVASTATING
Transportation is the tenth most
costly industry for experiencing a
data breach. On average, breaches
cost transit companies $3.58 million per incident and take 275 days
to contain. As cyberattacks on the
sector grow increasingly common,
these figures could grow, leading
to incredible losses.
Example of devastating attack: in
early May 2021, the Colonial Pipeline suffered a ransomware attack that forced it to shut down
its entire network to prevent the
malware from spreading.

Indeed, Colonial Pipeline, the largest oil pipeline in the United
States, shut down operations after suffering what is believed to
be a ransomware attack. Colonial
Pipeline transports refined petroleum products between refineries
on the Gulf Coast and markets in
the southern and eastern United
States. The company transports
2.5 million barrels per day through
its 5,500-mile pipeline and supplies
45% of all fuel consumed on the
East Coast
