That's a fantastic fact! The pH scale is indeed a fundamental tool in chemistry and has numerous applications across different fields. Here's another interesting chemical fact:

Did you know that water can act as an acid or a base? This concept might seem counterintuitive since water is typically neither acidic nor basic on the pH scale, but it actually has properties of both. When water (H2O) reacts with an acid or a base, it can donate or accept protons (hydrogen ions, H+), which makes it amphoteric.

In one common reaction, when water reacts with a strong acid like hydrochloric acid (HCl), the water acts as a base by accepting a proton to form the more stable hydronium ion (H3O+). The equation for this reaction is:

H2O + HCl → H3O+ + Cl-

In another reaction, when water reacts with a strong base like sodium hydroxide (NaOH), the water acts as an acid by donating a proton to form NaOH and a hydroxide ion (OH-). The equation for this reaction is:

H2O + NaOH → Na+ + OH-

These reactions are crucial in chemical processes and help maintain equilibrium in various systems, including the human body and environmental ecosystems.
