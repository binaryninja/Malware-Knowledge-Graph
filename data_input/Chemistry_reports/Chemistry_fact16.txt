**Point Defects:** These are individual atoms that are not located at their normal lattice points. There are three main types of point defects:
   - **Interstitial Atoms:** An extra atom occupies an interstitial site within the crystal lattice, distorting the surrounding atoms' positions.
   - **Substitutional Atoms:** A substitutional defect occurs when an atom of one element is replaced by another, such as in alloys where one metal replaces some atoms of another metal in the crystal lattice.
   - **Vacancies:** A vacancy occurs when an atom that should be present at a lattice point is missing, creating an empty space.

**Line Defects:** These are discontinuities or irregularities along the edges of crystals. They can include:
   - **Dislocations:** These defects occur when there is a displacement of one part of the crystal lattice relative to another, often associated with slips and cracks.
   - **Grain Boundaries:** In polycrystalline materials, these are the interfaces between crystallites (grains) of different orientations.

**Surface Defects:** These defects occur at the surface of a crystal and can include steps, kinks, or terrace edges, which are common on the surfaces of growing crystals.

**Volume Defects:** These are larger regions within the crystal where the lattice has been significantly disturbed, often due to impurities or other external factors.

Lattice defects can have a profound effect on the properties of a material. They can influence the material's electrical conductivity, optical properties, strength, and ductility. For example, dislocations are responsible for plastic deformation in metals and play a role in their malleability and formability.

The study of lattice defects is important in materials science and engineering, where controlling these defects can lead to improved performance in various applications, from electronic devices to structural materials.
