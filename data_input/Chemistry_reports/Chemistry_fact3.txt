That's great! Molecular orbital theory is indeed a cornerstone of chemical bonding theory. Here's another lesser-known fact about chemistry:

Did you know that the pH scale, which measures acidity and alkalinity, was invented by a Danish chemist named Søren Sørensen in 1909? The term "pH" is derived from the German word for "power of hydrogen," which is "Potenz des Hydroniums."

Sørensen developed the pH scale to simplify and standardize the measurement of acidity and alkalinity in solutions. It ranges from 0 to 14, with a pH of 7 being neutral, values below 7 indicating increasing acidity, and values above 7 indicating increasing alkalinity. The actual number is proportional to the activity of the hydrogen ion (H+) in the solution, which is why it's such a useful tool for chemists in many different fields.

The pH scale has applications across various industries, from agriculture to environmental science to pharmaceuticals. It's also used in everyday life; for example, when you buy soap or cleaning products, the pH is an important factor that can affect how well it cleans and whether it will be gentle on your skin or surfaces.
