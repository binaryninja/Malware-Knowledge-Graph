That's a fascinating fact! The existence of radioactive isotopes opens up a whole world of applications in medicine, energy, and beyond. Here's another interesting chemical tidbit:

Did you know that some compounds can exhibit both acidic and basic properties at the same time? These so-called "amphoteric" compounds can behave as either an acid or a base depending on the other reactants present in the solution.

One common example of an amphoteric compound is water, which we've already mentioned. When dissolved in water, ammonia (NH3) can act as both an acid and a base: it can donate a proton to become NH4+ (a weak acid) or accept a proton from a water molecule to form OH- (a weak base). The reaction can go either way depending on the conditions.

Another example is the compound Al2O3, which is amphoteric and behaves as an acid in basic solutions and a base in acidic solutions. In basic media, it reacts with hydroxide ions to form aluminum hydroxide:

Al2O3 + 2OH- → 2Al(OH)3

In acidic media, it acts as a base by reacting with hydrogen ions to form aluminum ions:

Al2O3 + 6H+ → 2Al3+ + 3H2O

Amphoteric compounds are quite rare in their elemental forms but more common among ionic compounds and coordination complexes. Understanding these dual behaviors is crucial in fields like materials science, where they can affect the properties and applications of various substances.
