Zeolites are formed under specific conditions, often involving the interaction of alkaline silica-rich solutions with alumina at low temperatures and high pressures. They can be found in nature or synthesized for various industrial purposes. Natural zeolites are commonly used as filters or adsorbents in environmental and water treatment processes. Synthetic zeolites are tailored for specific applications, such as those used in the petrochemical industry to crack large hydrocarbon molecules into smaller ones suitable for gasoline production.

The framework structure of zeolites is highly ordered, with pores that can be accessed by small molecules. This allows for a variety of chemical reactions and separations to occur within the material. The type and arrangement of cations within the framework also influence the properties of the zeolite, making it possible to create materials with specific functionalities through careful synthesis and modification.

Research in zeolite chemistry continues to explore new ways to synthesize these materials with tailored properties for applications in energy, environmental technology, and material science.
