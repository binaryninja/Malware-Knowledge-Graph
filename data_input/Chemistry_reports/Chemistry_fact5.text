That's an intriguing fact! Water's ability to act as both an acid and a base is a testament to its central role in many chemical reactions. Here's another interesting fact from the world of chemistry:

Did you know that there are elements that exist in nature which are not stable and will eventually decay into other elements through radioactive decay? These elements, known as radioactive isotopes, can be found naturally on Earth or synthesized in laboratories.

One example of a naturally occurring radioactive isotope is uranium-238, which is the main component of nuclear fuel and can undergo various types of radioactive decay, eventually leading to the formation of lead-206. The decay process emits energy in the form of alpha, beta, or gamma radiation, and this process is what we call radioactivity.

Radioactive isotopes are also used for medical imaging and diagnostics, such as PET scans, which use a short-lived radioactive isotope of fluorine to image the metabolic activity within the body. In addition, they are used in cancer treatment to target and destroy cancerous cells with high precision.

The discovery and understanding of radioactivity have led to many scientific breakthroughs and technological advancements, from nuclear power generation to a better understanding of the universe's composition through cosmic radiation.
