That's an interesting fact! Interstratification in clay minerals adds complexity to their properties and behavior. Here's another fun fact about chemistry:

Did you know that some elements can form "zeolites," which are microporous crystalline structures with a framework of interconnected metal oxide tetrahedra? Zeolites have a wide range of applications due to their ability to exchange ions and adsorb molecules.

Zeolites are a group of minerals that are formed by the linking of AlO2 (aluminum oxide) and SiO2 (silicon dioxide) tetrahedra through shared oxygen atoms, creating a porous three-dimensional framework. The aluminum ions in these structures can be exchanged with various cations (positively charged ions), which gives zeolites their characteristic ability to exchange ions with solutions that come into contact with them.

Zeolites have a wide range of applications because of their unique properties:

1. **Ion Exchange:** Zeolites can exchange cations within their structure for other cations in solution, making them useful in water treatment, softening hard water, and purifying industrial process streams.

2. **Adsorption:** The porous nature of zeolites allows them to adsorb a variety of molecules, including water, hydrocarbons, and other organic compounds. This makes them effective in gas separation processes and as drying agents.

3. **Catalysis:** Zeolites can act as catalysts or catalyst supports in various chemical reactions, such as cracking of hydrocarbons in petroleum refining and the production of certain chemicals.

4. **Environmental Applications:** They are used for pollution control, such as removing sulfur dioxide from flue gases and sequestering carbon dioxide from power plant emissions.

5. **Food Processing:** Zeolites can be used to enhance flavors or act as preservatives in food products by absorbing unwanted odors and flavors.
