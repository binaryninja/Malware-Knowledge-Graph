25 ESET RESEARCH CONTRIBUTIONS

Foreword
Welcome to the first quarterly ESET Threat Report!
The first quarter of 2020 was, without a doubt, defined by the outbreak of COVID-19 — now
a pandemic that has put much of the world under lockdown, disrupting peoples’ lives in
unprecedented ways.
In the face of these developments, many businesses were forced to swiftly adopt workfrom-home policies, thereby facing numerous new challenges. Soaring demand for remote
access and videoconferencing applications attracted cybercriminals who quickly adjusted
their attack strategies to profit from the shift.
Cybercriminals also haven’t hesitated to exploit public concerns surrounding the pandemic.
In March 2020, we saw a surge in scam and malware campaigns using the coronavirus pandemic as a lure, trying to capitalize on people’s fears and hunger for information.
Even under lockdown, our analysts, detection engineers and security specialists continued
to keep a close eye on this quarter’s developments. Some threat types — such as crypto­
miners or Android malware — saw a decrease in detections compared with the previous
quarter; others — such as web threats and stalkerware — were on the rise. Web threats in
particular have seen the largest increase in terms of overall numbers of detections, a
possible side effect of coronavirus lockdowns.
ESET Research Labs also did not stop investigating threats — Q1 2020 saw them dissect
obfuscation techniques in Stantinko’s new cryptomining module; detail the workings of
advanced Brazil-targeting banking trojan Guildma; uncover new campaigns by the infamous
Winnti Group and Turla; and uncover KrØØk, a previously unknown vulnerability affecting the
encryption of over a billion Wi‑Fi devices.
Before lockdowns became the new normal, experts from ESET Research Labs were sharing
their insights at security conferences and events around the world. In February, they unveiled the KrØØk vulnerability research and led a workshop for hunting Linux malware at
RSA Conference 2020, and presented two talks at BlueHat IL.
While seeing our researchers on stage might not be possible for a while, you can still
follow their findings on our blog, WeLiveSecurity, and the ESETresearch Twitter feed.
And, don’t forget, in these Threat Reports!
Happy reading, stay safe — and healthy!

ESET THREAT REPORT Q1 2020 | 2

ESET researchers uncover a previously unknown security flaw allowing
an adversary to decrypt some wireless network packets transmitted by
vulnerable devices.
ESET researchers discovered a previously
unknown vulnerability in Wi-Fi chips and
named it KrØØk.

FEATURED
STORY
KrØØk: Serious vulnerability
affected encryption of billion+
Wi‑Fi devices
Miloš Cermák and Robert Lipovský

Assigned CVE-2019-15126, this serious
flaw causes vulnerable devices to use an
all-zero encryption key to encrypt part
of the user’s communication. In a successful attack, this allows an adversary
to decrypt some wireless network packets transmitted by a vulnerable device.
KrØØk affects devices with Wi-Fi chips
madeby Broadcom and Cypress that
haven’t yet been patched. These are the
most common Wi-Fi chips used in contemporary Wi-Fi capable devices such as
smartphones, tablets, laptops, and IoT
gadgets.

Not only client devices but Wi-Fi access
points and routers with Broadcom chips
were affected by the vulnerability, thus
making many environments with unaffected or already patched client devices vulnerable anyway.
Our tests show that prior to patching,
some client devices by Amazon (Echo,
Kindle), Apple (iPhone, iPad, MacBook),
Google (Nexus), Samsung (Galaxy), Raspberry (Pi 3), Xiaomi (RedMi), as well as
some access points by Asus and Huawei,
were vulnerable to KrØØk. This totaled to
over a billion Wi-Fi-capable devices and
access points, at a conservative estimate. Further, many other vendors whose
products we did not test also use the
affected chipsets in their devices.
Both WPA2-Personal and WPA2-Enterprise
protocols, with AES-CCMP encryption, are
affected by this vulnerability.
KrØØk is related to KRACK [1] (Key Reinstallation Attacks), discovered in 2017
by Mathy Vanhoef, but also fundamentally different. In the beginning of our
research, we found KrØØk to be one of
the possible causes behind the “reinstallation” of an all-zero encryption key,
observed in tests for KRACK attacks.
This followed our previous findings that
Amazon Echo was vulnerable to KRACK [2].
We responsibly disclosed KrØØk to chip
manufacturers Broadcom and Cypress,
who subsequently released updates
during an extended disclosure period.

ESET THREAT REPORT Q1 2020 | 3

We also worked with the Industry Consortium for Advancement of Security on the Internet (ICASI) [3] to ensure
that all potentially affected parties — including affected
device manufacturers using the vulnerable chips, as well
as any other possibly affected chip manufacturers — were
aware of KrØØk.
According to our information, patches for devices from
major manufacturers have been released by now. To protect yourself, as a device owner, make sure you have applied the latest available updates to your Wi-Fi-capable
devices, including phones, tablets, laptops, IoT devices,
and Wi-Fi access points and routers. As a device manufacturer, please inquire about patches for KrØØk directly
with your chip manufacturer.
Special thanks to our colleagues Juraj Bartko and Martin
Kaluzník, who greatly contributed to this research. We’d
also like to commend Amazon, Broadcom, and Cypress for
their good cooperation in dealing with the reported issues
and ICASI for their assistance informing as many of the
impacted vendors as possible.
WeLiveSecurity blogpost [4] | KrØØk white paper [5] |
KrØØk website [6] | RSAC 2020 presentation [7]

The KrØØk vulnerability
KrØØk manifests itself after a disassociation. Once a station’s WLAN session gets disassociated, the session key
(TK) stored in the Wireless Network Interface Controller’s
(WNIC) Wi-Fi chip is cleared in memory — set to zero. This
is expected behavior, as no further data is supposed to be
transmitted after the disassociation. However, we discovered that all data frames that were left in the chip’s Tx
(transmit) buffer were transmitted after being encrypted
with this all-zero key.
As a result, the KrØØk vulnerability allows an attacker
to break into encrypted wireless network traffic of
unpatched devices.

* * * *

Fortunately, there are a few aspects that limit the impact
of the bug:
Firstly, it’s a vulnerability concerning encryption on the
wireless LAN (Wi-Fi) layer. It has nothing to do with TLS —
the encryption that secures online banking, email, and any
website prefixed with HTTPS. In other words, a successful attack exploiting KrØØk degrades a victim’s security a
step towards what they’d have on an open Wi-Fi network.
Secondly, as it’s tied to Wi-Fi, the attacker would have to
be in close proximity to the victim’s Wi-Fi signal. But —
wouldn’t need to know their Wi-Fi password!

Cryptomining
Stantinko botnet adds cryptomining to its pool of
criminal activities
ESET researchers discovered that the criminals behind the half-million-strong
Stantinko botnet [8] — known to have been active since at least 2012 and mainly
targeting users in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan — started distributing a
Monero-mining module to the computers they control. Previously, the botnet performed click fraud, ad injection, social network fraud and password stealing attacks.

Stantinko’s new cryptominer features unique
obfuscation techniques
In their investigation into Stantinko’s new cryptomining module, ESET researchers
discovered several obfuscation techniques intended to protect against detection
and thwart analysis. Aiming to help the cybersecurity industry improve protection
against sophisticated threats, ESET researchers shed light on the techniques and
described a possible approach to deobfuscating some of them — most notably obfus­
cation of strings and control-flow obfuscation.

Banking malware
Guildma: The Devil drives electric
ESET researchers dissected Guildma, a highly prevalent, Brazil-targeting banking
trojan notable for its innovative methods of execution, sophisticated attack techniques as well as impact in the region.

Latest findings from ESET Research
Labs across the world

Besides targeting financial institutions, Guildma also attempts to steal credentials
for email accounts, e-shops and streaming services. Like many other Latin American
banking trojans, Guildma implements a number of backdoor functions, abuses legitimate tools, and its functionality is split into many modules. It spreads via spam
emails with malicious attachments and has affected at least ten times as many
victims as other Latin American banking trojans analyzed by ESET.

Winnti Group
The Winnti Group, active since at least 2012, is responsible for highprofile supply-chain attacks against the video game and software
industries. It is also known for having compromised various targets in
the healthcare and education sectors.

Winnti Group targeting universities in Hong Kong

APT GROUP
ACTIVITY

ESET researchers discovered a new campaign run by the Winnti Group against two Hong
Kong universities. The researchers found a new variant of ShadowPad, the group’s
flagship backdoor, deployed using a new launcher and embedding numerous modules.
The Winnti malware was also found at these universities a few weeks prior to the
ShadowPad backdoor.
This campaign was taking place as widespread civic protests swept across Hong Kong,
including the territory’s universities.
In addition to the two confirmed compromised universities, ESET has indications that
at least three additional universities may have been affected. The attackers were
interested in stealing information from the victims’ machines.
ESET contacted the compromised universities and provided the necessary information
and assistance to remediate the compromise.

Both ShadowPad and Winnti, found at these universities in November 2019, contain
campaign identifiers and command and control URLs matching the names of the
universities, which indicates a targeted attack.
Mathieu Tartare, ESET Malware Researcher

Highlights from ESET investigations
into Advanced Persistent Threat
groups and their campaigns

ESET researchers recently published a white paper [12] updating their understanding
of the arsenal of the Winnti Group, following a blog post documenting a supply-chain
attack targeting the videogame industry in Asia [13]. Additionally, they published a
blog post on a new backdoor named skip-2.0 [14] that targets Microsoft SQL Server.

Compromised website

Turla
Turla, also known as Snake, is an infamous espionage group recognized for
its complex malware. It is believed to have been operating since at least
2008, when it successfully breached the US military.

New Turla backdoor delivered via watering hole on
Armenian websites

C&C

ESET researchers found a watering hole operation targeting several high-profile Armenian
websites. It relied on a social engineering trick — a fake Adobe Flash update — as a lure to
deliver two previously undocumented pieces of malware, dubbed NetFlash and PyFlash by
the researchers.
In this operation, Turla compromised at least four Armenian websites, including two
belonging to the government. Thus, it is likely the targets included government officials
and politicians. ESET notified the Armenian national CERT and shared the analysis with
them before publication.

Top 10 malware detections in Q1 2020 (% of malware detections)

ESET THREAT REPORT Q1 2020 | 8

Top 10 malware detections
LNK/Agent trojan Q4 2019: 1 ↔ Q1 2020: 1
LNK/Agent is a detection name for malware utilizing Windows LNK shortcut files to execute
other files on the system. Shortcut files have been gaining popularity among attackers,
as they are typically considered benign and less likely to raise suspicion. LNK/Agent files
don’t contain any payload and are usually parts of other, more complex malware. They are
often used to achieve persistence of the main malicious files on the system or as a part
of the compromise vector.

VBA/TrojanDownloader.Agent trojan Q4 2019: 2 ↔ Q1 2020: 2
VBA/TrojanDownloader.Agent is a detection typically covering maliciously crafted Microsoft Office files that try to manipulate users into enabling the execution of malicious
macros. Upon execution, the enclosed malicious macro typically downloads and executes
additional malware. The malicious documents are usually sent as email attachments, disguised as important information relevant to the recipient.

Win/Exploit.CVE-2017-11882 trojan Q4 2019: 4 ↑ Q1 2020: 3
This detection name stands for specially crafted documents exploiting the CVE-201711882 [17] vulnerability found in the Microsoft Equation Editor, a component of Microsoft
Office. The exploit is publicly available and usually used as the first stage of compromise.
When the user opens the malicious document, the exploit is triggered and its shellcode
executed. Additional malware is then downloaded onto the computer to perform arbitrary
malicious actions.

Win/Bundpil worm Q4 2019: 3 ↓ Q1 2020: 4
Win32/Bundpil is a worm capable of spreading via removable media. It is a part of Wauchos,
one of the largest botnet families, also known as Gamarue [18] or Andromeda. Bundpil was
designed to enhance the persistence of Wauchos and to make it harder to perform a global takedown of its network. As part of this, it contains a domain generation algorithm and
can alter DNS requests.

Win/Agent worm Q4 2019: 5 ↔ Q1 2020: 5
This detection name is for various malicious executables capable of self-replication.
Their common characteristics are the ability to spread to all available drives and gaining
persistence. In order to trick potential victims into executing these malicious files, the

filenames are often changed to impersonate harmless folders and files found on the system. They also usually contain basic backdoor capabilities, such as communication with a
C&C server, downloading and executing additional files, or keylogging.

HTML/Phishing.Agent trojan Q4 2019: 35 ↑ Q1 2020: 6
HTML/Phishing.Agent is a detection name for malicious HTML code often used in a phishing
email’s attachment. Attackers tend to use it instead of other file types, since executable
attachments are usually automatically blocked or more likely to raise suspicion. When
such an attachment is opened, a phishing site is opened in the web browser, posing as an
official banking, payment service or social networking website. The website requests
credentials or other sensitive information, which is then sent to the attacker.

Win/Phorpiex worm Q4 2019: 6 ↓ Q1 2020: 7
Win/Phorpiex is a worm that is used mainly to download other malware, distribute spam,
and perform DDoS attacks. It spreads via removable media and, to trick users into downloading and executing it, replaces legitimate files stored in web or FTP server folders
with copies of itself. It communicates through IRC channels.

Win/HackTool.Equation trojan Q4 2019: 7 ↓ Q1 2020: 8
The detection name Win32/HackTool.Equation covers tools attributed to the United States
National Security Agency (NSA) and made public by the hacking group Shadow Brokers. Soon
after the leak, these tools became widely used by cybercriminals. The detection also includes malware derived from these leaked tools or threats using the same techniques.

JS/Agent trojan Q4 2019: 16 ↑ Q1 2020: 9
This detection name covers various malicious JavaScript files. These are often obfuscated
to avoid static detections. They are typically placed onto compromised but otherwise
legitimate websites, with the aim of achieving drive-by compromise of visitors.

VBS/Agent worm Q4 2019: 8 ↓ Q1 2020: 10
VBS/Agent is a detection name for malicious Visual Basic scripts (VBS) spreading from one
system to another, mostly via removable drives and using various persistence methods.
Their purpose is to gather information about the compromised system, send it to a remote
machine and potentially download and execute other, usually more complex, malware.

ESET THREAT REPORT Q1 2020 | 9

Downloaders
The first quarter of 2020 saw weaker downloader activity but notable updates to the notorious Emotet trojan and its spreading mechanisms.
In Q1 2020, downloader families lost quite a bit of steam compared to Q4 2019, dropping in
overall numbers by more than 35%. ESET telemetry shows the most significant drop around
New Year’s Eve, which might be explained by transition from traditionally campaign-heavy
Christmas season to a calmer beginning of the year. Emotet’s “holiday break” [19] could
have also contributed to the plunge — note that VBA/TrojanDownloader.Agent is often
affiliated with Emotet.
The most significant spike of Q1 was observed around February 10. This could be explained
by the circumstances around the coronavirus outbreak in the Western Hemisphere. Malware
operators exploited the increased tension and fears among the general public to spread
coronavirus-themed malicious attachments, targeting mostly European countries in the
following order: Spain, Portugal, Czech Republic, Taiwan and Germany.
At the family level, VBA/TrojanDownloader.Agent has led the rankings since Q4. Its detections were four times higher than those of VBS/TrojanDownloader.Agent, the second-most
common family. VBA/TrojanDownloader.Agent is distributed through spam campaigns and is
predominantly spread via malicious Microsoft Office files. When opened, these macroenabled documents typically use PowerShell to download Win/Emotet binaries from
hacked websites.

Win/Emotet was particularly interesting this quarter. Researchers have spotted samples
[20] using its worm module to spread into nearby insecure Wi-Fi networks and infecting
connected users. ESET telemetry shows our products detected this Wi-Fi module as early
as April 2018, but only on a very limited number of occasions.

The low prevalence of the Wi-Fi module suggests that Emotet’s operators were
trying to keep it out of sight, perhaps reserving it for targeted attacks.

The Wi-Fi worm module saw a significant update at the beginning of February 2020. The
original version from 2018 was a self-extracting archive, containing the Emotet binary
and another malicious binary designed to brute-force access to nearby Wi-Fi networks and
subsequently to network shares. The updated version of Emotet’s Wi-Fi spreader added an
additional step after the brute-force attack, downloading second-stage malware from the
operator’s C&C, which then downloads the Emotet binary itself and runs it on the device,
making the update process more flexible.

ESET THREAT REPORT Q1 2020 | 10

Banking malware
Banking malware detections went up slightly in Q1 2020 according to ESET telemetry, with Win/Spy.Ursnif seeing the biggest increase compared to Q4 2019.
Following a significant drop in December 2019, global banking malware detections were on
a slight upwards trend in Q1 2020. The category was dominated by JS/Spy.Banker, which
accounted for more than a third of all banking malware detections. This detection name
covers a wide range of malicious scripts used to steal sensitive banking and credit card
information from victims’ browsers.
When comparing the most prevalent banking malware threats from Q1 2020 to those from
the previous quarter, Win/Spy.Ursnif saw the most significant change — a jump from 5.9%
of banking malware detections in Q4 2019 to 13% in Q1 2020.
Ursnif, also known as a variant of the Gozi malware, is a high-profile and very active
banking trojan specializing in credential and data theft. It is known to spread via email
through malicious links and attachments, and exploit kits. The uptick in detections in Q1
2020 is connected to a wave of malicious spam attachments we observed at the beginning
of the year. These spam messages claimed to be about legislative changes for 2020, while
the executable attachments were disguised as PPT or PDF files.

Top 10 banking malware families in Q1 2020 (% of banking malware detections)

Besides the most prevalent families, an interesting category of banking malware are the
banking trojans that specifically target Latin America. Investigating these threats, ESET
researchers have identified more than 10 malware families, interlinked through many common characteristics. In Q1 2020, ESET published its analysis of Guildma [11], an advanced
Brazil-targeting banking trojan.

The Latin American banking trojans we have identified have many things in
common: they are written in Delphi, contain backdoor functionality and are
usually delivered via quite long execution chains. To steal banking information,
they typically rely on a combination of social engineering and fake pop-up
windows — rather than web injections commonly used elsewhere.
Jakub Soucek, ESET Malware Analyst

Win/Spy.Grandoreiro being the most prevalent.

ESET THREAT REPORT Q1 2020 | 11

Ransomware
Ransomware operators add doxing as their new go-to tactic, yet vow to spare hospitals during the coronavirus pandemic.
ESET detected an overall drop in ransomware activity in Q1 2020 with January 2020 seeing
the most action despite a slow start after New Year’s Eve.

Win/Filecoder.WannaCryptor trojan
Win/Filecoder.Crysis trojan

According to ESET telemetry, the uptick in January was caused by two major campaigns:
one by the Crysis family (12.9% of all Filecoder1 detections in January) and another targeting South African users by the Sodinokibi family (13.4% of all Filecoder detections in
January). The latter malware strain used powershell.exe as its parent process, indicating
that the Sodinokibi operators delivered the payload via malicious email attachments using
PowerShell to run the ransomware.
WannaCryptor dominated the top 10 ransomware family ranking throughout the first
quarter of 2020, even though it has been almost three years since its largest outbreak in
May 2017. Most of the Q1 WannaCryptor detections were attributed to well-known samples
spread in regions with potentially higher numbers of unpatched devices, namely Turkey,
Thailand and Indonesia.

ESET telemetry showed a similar situation with detections of older variants of GandCrab,
some of which originated as far back as 2018. Operators behind the Q1 campaigns used
emails to spread these variants mostly to potential victims in Germany, Japan and Italy.
Just as in the music charts, there’s plenty of movement in the top positions — different
families move up and down in prominence. The most commonly seen, WannaCryptor, was followed by Crysis, Sodinokibi, STOP and Phobos families, which were fighting and replacing
each other in the rankings. February 2020 also saw a newcomer in the top 10, Nemty — first
observed in the wild in August 2019. However, Nemty was promptly replaced by Cerber in
the following month.

The last days of March saw an odd behavior by the DeathRansom operators, who started to
mimic an older version of the GandCrab ransomware, version 5.1. The most visible characteristic of this shift was the use of GandCrab’s ransom note. What differs is the TOR link
that does not include the “gandcrab” string — a “telltale” of the original perpetrators not
present in the current DeathRansom page. Further, DeathRansom’s landing page does not
resemble one that was used by GandCrab.

ESET classifies ransomware into Filecoder and Diskcoder categories, depending on whether they target files or disk volumes, respectively.

ESET THREAT REPORT Q1 2020 | 12

A significant new trend emerged toward the end of Q4 2019, as ransomware operators
started to steal their victims’ sensitive data and threaten to make it public, unless the
ransom is paid. This technique — also called doxing — is employed in addition to the
unwanted encryption of the victim’s data.
Attackers use this approach to increase pressure on the victim, who has to cope with
multiple problems including stalled business operations, financial loss, reputational harm,
reporting to authorities and potential fines (due to GDPR or other legislation) as well as
with loss of competitive advantage, if confidential data is leaked online.
Doxing had initially been used by operators of Maze ransomware; however, inspired by its
effectiveness, other ransomware operators followed suit in Q1 2020. High-profile families
seen adopting the approach include DoppelPaymer, Sodinokibi, RobinHood, and Nemty.
One of the first victims that was doxed by Maze was the US wire and cable manufacturer
Southwire. Maze operators stole 120 GB of its data, encrypted nearly 900 devices and demanded $6 million to restore to the previous state. When Southwire refused to pay, Maze
started publishing its data, which was met by a lawsuit and preventive steps against the
provider hosting the leaked data.

Some ransomware operators have decided not to attack medical organizations,
but that didn’t discourage others from doing so. There have been quite a few
examples of that in the first quarter of 2020.
Igor Kabina, ESET Senior Detection Engineer
An interesting ransomware-related case was described in a mid-February 2020 alert [24]
by US-CERT. The cyberattack targeted a natural gas compression facility. The threat actor
used a spearphishing link to gain initial access to the IT networks and leveraged that to
access the operational technology (OT) network. Both were subsequently compromised with
commodity ransomware. The incident led to loss of productivity and revenue but did not
cause the organization to lose control of operations. US-CERT also states that the case
could have been prevented if the victim had implemented robust segmentation between its
IT and OT networks.

Post by Maze operators on a Russian hacking forum (Image source: BleepingComputer.com [21])

Another interesting turn in Q1 2020 was prompted by the COVID-19 outbreak in Western
countries. Surprisingly, operators of some families (e.g. Maze, DoppelPaymer) released
public statements promising not to target health or medical organizations [22] so as not
to worsen the effects of the pandemic. However, some families — such as Ryuk — have
continued business as usual.

Q1 2020 shed some light on the earnings of ransomware operators. According to a talk
delivered by FBI Special Agent Joel DeCapua at the RSA 2020 Conference [25], attackers
using encrypting Filecoders have earned at least $140 million over the past six years.
At least that is the sum of all transactions observed on bitcoin wallets associated with
ransom notes. Most of the money has been transferred to wallets connected with Ryuk
(over $61 million) and Crysis/Dharma (almost $24.5 million).
Agent DeCapua also stressed that in the overwhelming number of cases, RDP is still
the primary vector used to compromise businesses. According to FBI data, up to 80%
of successful ransomware attacks are accomplished via breaking into the network by
brute-forcing RDP credentials. DeCapua’s full talk can be found on YouTube [26].

Cryptominers
In the cryptomining theater, the most notable trend observed in Q1 2020 was continuing decline of cryptomining activities. Cryptominers classified as
potentially unwanted applications have seen the most significant downturn.
ESET security products detect cryptominers as potentially unwanted applications (PUA) or
trojans — the latter being those configured to mine cryptocurrency without the victim’s
knowledge or consent. While in Q4 2019 the trojan:PUA ratio in cryptominers was 52:48,
the decline in PUAs led to the ratio growing to 60:40 in Q1 2020.
As seen in the chart below, there was a gradual but consistent decline in global
detections of malicious cryptominers, a trend that is a continuation of the decline
observed since the beginning of 2019.

As exchange rates of cryptocurrencies fall, so do the bad actors’ revenues.
As a result, their interest in having people’s devices mine coins wanes.
Juraj Jánošík, Head of Automated Threat Detection and Machine Learning

Besides the drop in price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the decline in crypto­
mining activities observed in Q4 2019 and Q1 2020 can be, to a large extent, attributed
to Operation Goldfish Alpha [27]. This operation, coordinated by INTERPOL, identified over
20,000 hacked routers in the ASEAN region, which reportedly accounted for 18% of global
infections of cryptomining malware. By late November 2019, the number of infected devices had been reduced by 78%, according to INTERPOL.
Malicious JavaScript used for in-browser mining, detected as JS/CoinMiner, didn’t recover
following the demise of the infamous Coinhive [28] mining service in March of 2019. While
in Q1 2019 these covered around 30% of all the cryptominer detections, in Q1 2020 their
share hovered just above 10%, virtually unchanged compared to Q4 2019.
Despite having been predicted by some to grow, Android coinminers — both trojans and
PUAs — remain virtually non-existent.

Spyware & backdoors
According to ESET telemetry, Q1 2020 saw a steady level of spyware and backdoor detections, with Win/HoudRat dominating the landscape.
Aside from the usual drop at the turn of the year, spyware and backdoor detections were
fairly constant across Q4 2019 and Q1 2020. Backdoor detections have been reaching
approximately double the number of spyware detections.

Exploits
Network security has come into the spotlight, with criminals apparently attracted by networks more open to incoming traffic due to more people working
from home.

Another vulnerability that saw the number of attack attempts dwindling in Q1 2020 was
BlueKeep [30]. This “wormable” critical Remote Code Execution vulnerability in Remote
Desktop Services was disclosed after being patched in May 2019. After some initial
dramatic spikes in activity, the number of attacks started to decrease, continuing
through Q1 2020.
From the network security point of view, one of the key pain points remains the Remote
Desktop Protocol (RDP). We witnessed large scale password guessing attacks, a trend that
recently strengthened, apparently with the coronavirus-induced lockdowns. In regard to
RDP security, refer to this ESET advisory [31].

Mac threats
According to ESET telemetry, Mac threats had a steady first quarter in 2020.
The first quarter of 2020 saw a small surge in macOS threat detections in January and
a subsequent return to a steady state slightly below the average for 2019. The vast ma­
jority of Mac threats detected by ESET products in Q1 2020 fall into the category of
Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUA), followed by Potentially Unsafe Applications
(PUsA), adware and trojans.

Mac computers (i.e. those powered by the macOS operating system) are less targeted by
malware than Windows or Linux devices. Apple’s “walled garden” strategy, albeit often
criticized for other reasons, makes it difficult for malware to sneak onto a Mac. A key
element of macOS security is the mechanism called Gatekeeper that checks if code
has been signed by Apple. Apps failing that check can only be installed with the
user’s explicit permission.

Android threats
Ad-displaying apps steadily dominate the Android threat landscape, but it’s stalkerware that is attracting the greatest attention.
Although overall Android threat detection levels were steady through Q1 2020, they were
at a noticeably lower level than in the first half of Q4 2019. Android/Hiddad continued
to rank first among detected families, and along with Android/HiddenApp and others, con­
tributed to Hidden Apps remaining the most prevalent category of Android threats. Their
key features are hiding their icons after installation and then going on to bombard users
with full-screen ads. These shady apps commonly make it into the Google Play store,
masquerading as attractive games or photo editing apps.

Apps in the Hidden Apps category display adware behavior, but their stealth
capabilities set them apart from traditional adware, and they are fairly prevalent.
For these reasons we have been tracking them outside of the broad adware
category.

Stalkerware
The number of detections in the Stalkerware category (also called spouseware by some) has risen by about a third compared to Q4 2019.
ESET treats the Stalkerware category of Android threats differently from the other types
of so-called Potentially Unwanted Applications that it technically belongs to. Stalkerware
is a classic example of dual-purpose technology — an otherwise legitimate tool that can be
easily misused to serve illegitimate goals.

Typically, stalkerware is marketed as a tool that enables monitoring children, students or
employees. In reality, these apps are often used for spying upon unsuspecting spouses or
romantic partners, sometimes with tragic consequences for those victims. For this reason,
ESET has reclassified these apps from the Potentially Unwanted Applications category in
order to raise warnings about their nature independent of the customer’s settings.

Android/Androidlost monitor

The class of Stalkerware apps is an extremely fragmented one: ESET researchers keep

of under five percent, while the dominant stalkerware family accounts for over 25% of
detections in this category.

Besides being a threat when used for illegitimate purposes, stalkerware apps tend to have

The trend data is broken down into categories based on the type of threat blocked:

• Malware: websites known to serve malware
• Scam: websites with fraudulent content
• Phishing: websites used to harvest sensitive data
• Malware Object: otherwise legitimate websites (e.g. cloud storage services) hosting
malicious code

While the Malware category had the most overall blocks, the largest number of unique URLs
blocked belonged to the Scam category. Phishing had the most blocked attacks per unique
URL — approximately 20.
According to ESET telemetry data, ESET customers in Russia, Peru, Japan, the United States

Coronavirus pandemic as a lure
In mid-March, we saw a surge in coronavirus-themed web attacks. These ranged from
fraudulent online stores claiming to sell face masks and other personal protective
equipment, all the way to websites distributing dangerous malware.
In the latter category, ESET telemetry detected a malicious website impersonating the
World Health Organization (WHO) that tried to manipulate users into downloading what is
presented as “COVID-19 Information App”. Instead, victims ended up downloading malware;
we’ve seen the website serve a malicious cocktail of downloaders, spyware and ransomware, with the payload changing frequently.

Top 10 blocked Malware, Scam and Phishing domains in Q1 2020

Homoglyph attacks
Homoglyph attacks rely on replacing characters (or glyphs in font design terms) in
URLs with ones that look similar — or are even visually identical — but are different to
computers, as they belong to different alphabets. These attacks may be very dangerous
for users, as they have only a limited chance of detecting the trap.
To protect high-value target domains — banks, financial institutions and payment
platforms, prominent email services, and reputable media — ESET products perform a
rigorous inspection. They check the letters of
protected URLs against a table of similar letters
banesco
from any other alphabet and warn the customer if
any deception attempt is detected.

instagram

According to ESET telemetry, the domain most
impersonated by “homoglyphed” lookalikes in Q1
2020 was apple.com, followed by instagram.com
and blockchain.com. In the case of apple.com, most
of the detections came from a single domain that
is educational in nature, and not malicious.
The domains impersonating instagram.com and
blockchain.com, however, are malicious.

1st and March 16th. Detection of these threats was most prevalent among ESET customers in
the United States, Russia and Ukraine, whose detections, combined, accounted for 70% of
the overall detections of these coronavirus-related web threats.
In the Malware category, coronavirus[.]zone was the most blocked threat, distributing
HTML/ScrInject.B — malicious code that redirects the browser to other URLs with further malware. Most prevalent in the Phishing category was chasecovid19v[.]com, while
survivecoronavirus[.]org was the most blocked Scam website.

When interpreting the data, it should be taken into account that our visibility into spam
traffic is limited, as emails may be filtered at the internet email service provider, or
elsewhere, before reaching ESET’s antispam solution on client machines. However, the
fact that the detected spam traffic may have bypassed other antispam solutions further
signifies its threat potential.

Coronavirus spam
As if the coronavirus outbreak wasn’t serious enough by itself, fraudsters wasted no
time in trying to profit from the uncertainty, fear, and supply shortages connected to
the crisis. In March 2020, we detected a flood of COVID-19 themed spam, spreading malware, phishing for sensitive information, or offering bogus products — face masks, natural
coronavirus remedies, or even a purported list of ingredients for a coronavirus vaccine.

the spammers incorporated characters from the Greek alphabet that look very similar to
standard Latin characters into the email’s text — for example, α (lowercase Alpha) is used
instead of lowercase a. In another twist on the same tactic, extortionists tried to intimidate the recipients by claiming the emails came from a neighbor — someone who is close by
and could easily infect them if they didn’t pay up.

In multiple campaigns, spammers took to impersonating the World Health Organization
(WHO), aiming to manipulate unsuspecting users into opening malicious links or attachments. The WHO, a major source of information about the pandemic, has addressed this
concerning trend on its website [32].

Spam email impersonating the WHO

Upsettingly, cybercriminals in the extortion email business have also been trying to profit from the coronavirus crisis, going as far as threatening to infect email recipients and
their families with coronavirus if no ransom is paid.
Coronavirus-themed extortion scam emails

In the spam campaign shown in the screenshot on the upper right, criminals took an email
template from one of the many previous (s)extortion scam campaigns [33] and customized it to fit the coronavirus pandemic theme. In an attempt to fool antispam engines,

As with most email extortion campaigns, the claims in these emails are unfounded and
should be treated as any other spam email.

IoT security
Years-old vulnerabilities that allow attackers to bypass access controls dominate the list of most frequent flaws detected on IoT devices.
Devices referred to as Internet of Things often suffer from vulnerabilities or misconfiguration issues that allow them to be exploited. ESET’s router vulnerability scanner module
scanned over a hundred thousand routers worldwide this quarter showing vulnerabilities
that could result in unauthorized access — such as password or information leakage or
directory traversal — to be the predominant type of IoT issues.
This finding is further bolstered by this kind of flaw representing seven of the top ten
IoT vulnerabilities detected by ESET’s scanner. What stands out is also the age of the
front-runners in that list. According to ESET telemetry, none of the top 10 were discovered after 2017 and five out of the ten have been known since 2014.
The leading vulnerability — CVE-2012-5687 [34] — is even older and was first reported in
October 2012. Despite being around for seven-plus years it still accounts for 19% of all
vulnerabilities found. Old command-injection vulnerabilities are quite prevalent too,
occupying second (CVE-2014-8361 with 12%) and third (CVE-2014-9583 with 8%) places.
ESET’s telemetry also provides insight into the prevalence of cases when hosted services
are protected by weak or default passwords. Such linkage seems to be particularly strong
in cases where HTTP was used, representing 63% of detections, followed by telnet with
22% and FTP with 13%.

Weak password prevalence per hosted service in Q1 2020

A powerful illustration of how deficiencies in IoT security can severely weaken security
of entire networks is illustrated by the KrØØk vulnerability [5].
KrØØk manifests itself as wireless network data being encrypted with a WPA2 pairwise
session key that is all zeros and occurs on vulnerable chips following a Wi-Fi disassociation (“disconnection”). Such disassociations (and reassociations) occur naturally for a
variety of (legitimate) reasons, such as signal interference or roaming between access
points. Thus, anyone sniffing network data is theoretically able to decrypt the small
amount of data that was that was queued for transmission just before the disassociation.
Obviously, such a passive approach would require a large element of luck in order to
obtain any data of interest.
For a much more effective attack, an active adversary can exploit KrØØk by manually triggering disassociations on the target’s device repeatedly, thus greatly increasing the
likelihood of intercepting (potentially sensitive) data of interest.

When compared to other techniques commonly used against Wi-Fi, exploiting
KrØØk has a significant advantage for attackers: while they need to be in range
of the Wi-Fi signal, they do not need to be authenticated and associated to the
WLAN. In other words, they don’t need to know the Wi-Fi password.”

MITRE ATT&CK contributions
Besides publishing, and presenting their findings at conferences, ESET researchers
regularly contribute to MITRE ATT&CK® [38] — a globally-accessible knowledge base of
adversary tactics and techniques.
As of April 2020, ESET is one of the top five contributors to the ATT&CK Enterprise Matrix
[39], one of the first and most active contributors to the Mobile Matrix [40], and one of
the most heavily referenced sources in both matrices.
At the time of writing, there are more than 100 contributors and 300 referenced sources
for the Enterprise Matrix and six contributors and more than 100 referenced sources for
the Mobile matrix.

Contributions from the threat intelligence community play a critical role in
helping us refine and extend the coverage of the MITRE ATT&CK® knowledge
base. Making cyberspace safer requires a collaborative effort, and the realworld reporting of adversary tactics and techniques from outside sources
helps make ATT&CK a valuable asset for defenders.
Adam Pennington, MITRE ATT&CK Lead

ESET’s contributions include new entries to the Enterprise and Mobile Techniques, Groups
and Software categories, as well as extensions of existing entries.
In the Enterprise Techniques category, one of ESET‘s notable contributions is the unique
Transport Agent (T1505) [41] arising from ESET’s analysis of LightNeuron [42], a backdoor
used by the Turla group. LightNeuron implements a malicious Microsoft Exchange transport
agent for persistence.
The Software category features LoJax (S0397) [43], a UEFI rootkit used by Sednit (also
known as APT28), discovered [44] by ESET and the first UEFI rootkit found in the wild.
In the Groups category, one of ESET’s contributions is Machete (G0095) [45], a cyberespionage group with high-profile targets in Latin American countries, reported [46] by ESET
researchers to have stolen gigabytes of confidential data over the course of a year.
ESET’s Android threat research also made it into ATT&CK — the Mobile category includes
the Input Injection (T1516) [47] and Access Notifications (T1517) [48] techniques, used by
various kinds of data-stealing Android malware.
Along with ESET references on the ATT&CK website, readers will also find tables mapping
adversary techniques to the ATT&CK knowledge base in the end sections of ESET research
publications on the WeLiveSecurity blog [49].

Other contributions
ESET researchers have also been contributing to the YARA code base, a tool widely used by
the malware research community. In Q1 2020, ESET had two pull requests merged into the
main code base.
The first accepted pull request [50], based on research by ESET malware researchers Peter
Kálnai and Michal Poslušný, extended YARA’s Rich Header functionality to better represent
the underlying data and enable full utilization of Rich Header data.
The second contribution [51] driven by ESET malware researcher Anton Cherepanov, improves YARA’s PE module by adding a new feature for parsing PDB strings. This new feature
makes it possible to create better YARA rules to hunt and detect Windows malware that
has specific keywords in PDB paths.

The threat statistics and trends presented in this report are based on global telemetry
data from ESET. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the data includes threats regardless
of the targeted platform and includes only unique daily detections per device.

Foreword
Roman Kovác, Chief Research Officer

This data was processed with the honest intention to mitigate all known biases, in an
effort to maximize the value of the information provided on the most significant inthe-wild threats.
Further, the data excludes detections of potentially unwanted applications [52],
potentially unsafe applications [53] and adware, except where noted in the more detailed,
platform-specific sections and in the Cryptominers section.
Most of the charts in this report show detection trends rather than providing absolute
numbers. This is because the data can be prone to various misinterpretations, especially
when directly compared to other telemetry data. However, absolute values or orders of
magnitude are provided where deemed beneficial.
