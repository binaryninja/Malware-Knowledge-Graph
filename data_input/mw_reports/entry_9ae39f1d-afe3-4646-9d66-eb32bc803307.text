A new CryptoMix Ransomware variant has been discovered that appends the .CLOP or
.CIOP extension to encrypted files. Of particular interest, is that this variant is now indicating
that the attackers are targeting entire networks rather than individual computers.
This variant was discovered by MalwareHunterTeam, who has noticed that the developers
are switching between different email addresses and slight variations in the extension.
Signed & low detected (as usual), yesterday evening build of CryptoMix Clop
ransomware sample: https://t.co/20KMkc3S9X
Again some changes in the note, and now it has 3 email addresses...
Also, new mutex and "messages" too.

As we are always looking for weaknesses, if you are a victim of this variant and decide to
pay the ransom, please send us the decryptor so we can take a look at it. You can also
discuss or receive support for Cryptomix ransomware infections in our dedicated
1/9

Cryptomix Help & Support Topic.

The Clop CryptoMix Ransomware variant
It has been quite a while since we covered a new CryptoMix variant and some things have
changed since then.
This variant is currently being distributed using executables that have been code-signed
with a digital signature. Doing so makes the executable appear more legitimate and may
help to bypass security software detections.

In an analysis by security researcher Vitali Kremez, when started this variant will first stop
numerous Windows services and processes in order to disable antivirus software and close
all files so that they are ready for encryption. Examples of processes that are shutdown
include Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, BackupExec, and more.

Sample of Stopped Services (Source: Vitali Kremez Tweet)
Another item noticed by BleepingComputer in this variant is that it will create a batch file
named clearnetworkdns_11-22-33.bat that will be executed soon after the ransomware is
launched. This batch file will disable Windows's automatic startup repair, remove shadow
volume copies, and then resize them in order to clear orphaned shadow volume copies.

Remove Shadow Volume Copies
The ransomware will then begin to encrypt a victims files. When encrypting files it will
append the .Clop or .CIop extension to the encrypted file's name. For example, a test file
encrypted by this variant has an encrypted file name of test.jpg.CIop.

Encrypted CIop Files
This variant will also create a ransom note named CIopReadMe.txt that is now indicating
that they are targeting an entire network rather than an individual computer. Whether this is
true or not is not known at this time, as the ransomware itself does not have the ability to
self-propagate, but could be done manually if the attackers are hacking into Remote
Desktop Services.

Ransom Note
This ransom note also contain the emails
unlock@eqaltech.su, unlock@royalmail.su, and kensgilbomet@protonmail.com that
can be used to contact the attackers for payment instructions.
Unfortunately, at this time the ransomware cannot be decrypted for free. You can receive
support or discuss Cryptomix ransomware infections in our dedicated Cryptomix Help &
Support Topic.

How to protect yourself from the Ransomware
In order to protect yourself from ransomware it is important that you use good computing
habits and security software. The most important step is to always have a reliable and
tested backup of your data that can be restored in the case of an emergency, such as a
ransomware attack.
You should also make sure that you do not have any computers running remote desktop
services connected directly to the Internet. Instead place computers running remote
desktop behind VPNs so that they are only accessible to those who have VPN accounts on
your network.

5/9

A good security software solution that incorporates behavioral detections to combat
ransomware and not just use signature detections or heuristics is important as well. For
example, Emsisoft Anti-Malware and Malwarebytes Anti-Malware both contain behavioral
detection that can prevent many, if not most, ransomware infections from encrypting a
computer.
Last, but not least, make sure you practice the following security habits, which in many
cases are the most important steps of all:
Backup, Backup, Backup!
Do not open attachments if you do not know who sent them.
Do not open attachments until you confirm that the person actually sent you them,
Scan attachments with tools like VirusTotal.
Do not connect Remote Desktop Services directly to the Internet. Instead, make sure
they can only be accessed by logging into a VPN first.
Make sure all Windows updates are installed as soon as they come out! Also make
sure you update all programs, especially Java, Flash, and Adobe Reader. Older
programs contain security vulnerabilities that are commonly exploited by malware
distributors. Therefore it is important to keep them updated.
Make sure you use have some sort of security software installed that uses behavioral
detections or white list technology. White listing can be a pain to train, but if your
willing to stock with it, could have the biggest payoffs.
Use hard passwords and never reuse the same password at multiple sites.
BACKUP!

If you look at it from a different angle, then the same letter "L" is used for the
extension and name of the note, but not "I".

To see it where the letter l and I of the font are similar, just need to translate the letters
into another font.
