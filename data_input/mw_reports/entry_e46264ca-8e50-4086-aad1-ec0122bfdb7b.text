Ukraine's Computer Emergency Response Team is warning that threat actors are distributing
fake Windows antivirus updates that install Cobalt Strike and other malware.
The phishing emails impersonate Ukrainian government agencies offering ways to increase
network security and advise recipients to download "critical security updates," which come in
the form of a 60 MB file named "BitdefenderWindowsUpdatePackage.exe."

Phishing email urging the download of a fake AV updater (CERT-UA)
These emails contain a link to a French website (now offline) that offers download buttons for
the alleged AV software updates. Another website, nirsoft[.]me, was also discovered by
MalwareHunterTeam to be acting as the command and control server for this campaign.

When a victim downloads and run this fake BitDefender Windows update [VirusTotal], the
screen below will be shown prompting the users to install a 'Windows Update Package.'

However, this 'update' actually downloads and installs the one.exe file [VirusTotal] from the
Discord CDN, which is a Cobalt Strike beacon.
Cobalt Strike is a widely abused penetration testing suite that offers offensive security
capabilities, facilitates lateral network movement, and ensures persistence.
The same process fetches a Go downloader (dropper.exe) which decodes and executes a
base-64-encoded file (java-sdk.exe).
This file adds a new Windows registry key for persistence and also downloads two more
payloads, the GraphSteel backdoor (microsoft-cortana.exe) and GrimPlant backdoor (oraclejava.exe).

The infection chain of the uncovered campaign (CERT-UA)
All executables in the campaign are packed on the Themida tool, which protects them from
reverse engineering, detection, and analysis.

Go payloads
Both GraphSteel and GrimPlant are malware written in Go, a versatile and cross-platform
programming language with minimal footprint and low AV detection rates.
The capabilities of the two tools cover network reconnaissance, command execution, and file
operations, so the fact that both are deployed in the same system is likely done for
redundancy.
GraphSteel features:
Gather hostname, username, and IP address information
Execute commands
Steal account credentials
Use WebSocket and GraphQL to communicate with C2 using AES and base64
encryption
GrimPlant capabilities:
Gather IP address, hostname, OS, username, home dir
Execute commands received remotely and return results to C2
Use gRPC (HTTP/2+SSL) for C2 communication
Not many technical details have been provided on these two payloads, and we can't exclude
the possibility of them being known backdoors given new names in this report.

Attribution
Given the current situation in Ukraine, it's easy to attribute all hostile activity to Russian and
pro-Russian threat actors, and this seems to be the case here too.
The Ukrainian Computer Emergency Response Team associates the detected activity with
the UAC-0056 group with medium confidence.
UAC-0056, also known as "Lorec53", is a sophisticated Russian-speaking APT that uses a
combination of phishing emails and custom backdoors to collect information from Ukrainian
organizations.
UAC-0056 was spotted ramping up its phishing distribution and network compromise efforts
in Ukraine since December 2021.
The same actor was spotted targeting Georgian government agencies with phishing lures in
the recent past, so there's a high level of coordination and alignment with the interests of the
Russian state.
