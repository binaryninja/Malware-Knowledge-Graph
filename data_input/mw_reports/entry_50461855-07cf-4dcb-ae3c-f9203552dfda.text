This blog post will try to explain how the ransomware called DarkSide works. Based on my
research, this ransomware uses Salsa20 encryption to encrypt files and RSA encryption to
encrypt the key used by Salsa20. A new key is created per file based on random bytes.

1/8

A new ransomware operation named DarkSide began attacking organizations earlier
this month with customized attacks that have already earned them million-dollar
payouts.
Starting around August 10th, 2020, the new ransomware operation began performing
targeted attacks against numerous companies.
In a “press release” issued by the threat actors, they claim to be former affiliates who
had made millions of dollars working with other ransomware operations.

Unpacking
The executable is compressed with UPX
file 9cee5522a7ca2bfca7cd3d9daba23e9a30deb6205f56c12045839075f7627297
[...]: PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows, UPX compressed

After the first instruction pushad I put a breakpoint on the ESP register and continue.

The execution breaks on the instruction lea eax, dword ptr ss:[esp80] . After the loop
is executed it jumps to the entry point of the packed executable.

Once the executable is unpacked, we can analyze the ransomware

Anti-analysis
To make static analysis harder the ransomware resolves DLL’s and API calls dynamically
using LoadLibrary , GetProcAddress and 2 custom functions shown below. In this
screenshot, the address of _wcsicmp is resolved in memory.

Preparation
The mutex Global\\3e93e49583d6401ba148cd68d1f84af7 is created to make sure only
one copy of the ransomware is running, otherwise the ransomware exits. This is done based
on the name of the executable. Then SetThreadExecutionState is called to force the
system to be in the working state by resetting the system idle timer.
Services
To make sure certain services are not running the following services are stopped using
ControlService - SERVICE_CONTROL_STOP and DeleteService . Deleting a service is
not useful if an organization pays the ransom and wants to go back into production quickly.
As a system administrator, I wouldn’t be happy about this.
vss
sql
svc$
memtas
mepocs
sophos
veeam

Shadow Copies
Using CreateProcessW the following Powershell script is executed which deletes Shadow
Volume Copies.
powershell -ep bypass -c \"(0..61)|%{$s+=[char][byte]
('0x'+'4765742D576D694F626A6563742057696E33325F536861646F77636F7079207C20466F724561636
$s\"

When deobfuscated, we can see that this PowerShell command is used to delete
Shadow Volume Copies on the machine before encrypting it.
Get-WmiObject Win32_Shadowcopy | ForEach-Object {$_.Delete();}

Processes
To make sure certain processes are not running a list of processes are terminated
(https://pastebin.com/WWSQxhcq.

Encryption
The encryption routine skips a few files, file extensions and directories
(https://pastebin.com/WWSQxhcq).

The encryption routine of the ransomware is shown below.

Debugging mode
5/8

I don’t know why but it seems the authors have forgotten to disable debugging functionality in
their code or maybe they are using this to verify that the files are encrypted. (XXX = file
name). This file was in the same directory as the executable.
