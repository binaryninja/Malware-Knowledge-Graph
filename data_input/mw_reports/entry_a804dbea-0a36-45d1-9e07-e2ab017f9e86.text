WeTheNorth: A New Canadian Dark Web Marketplace
recordedfuture.com/wethenorth-canadian-dark-web/

This Summer, Insikt Group discovered a new Canada-focused darknet marketplace called
WeTheNorth, a salute to the Toronto Raptors basketball team slogan. This localized criminal
marketplace features a variety of illegal goods and services for sale, many of which pose a
threat to local and global enterprises.
Insikt Group judges that with moderate confidence that WeTheNorth market was likely
created to replace the now debunked The Canadian Headquarters, which shut down in July
2021. Insikt Group’s Criminal Underground Team first discovered WeTheNorth in July 2021
in advertisements posted on open source forums such as Reddit. The new market appears
similar in appearance to the now-debunked Empire market, Alpha Bay, and Torrez.
What makes WeTheNorth unique is the lengths the administrators have gone to create a
marketplace that is ostensibly geared toward protecting Canadian buyers and sellers and
fostering a relatively safe place to complete transactions.
Their mission statement is “to provide a safe environment so that Canadians are able to
purchase safely, scam-free and away from the street violence, drugs and other items that are
more potent, cleaner and safer to use.”
The rules of the marketplace are geared towards reigning in what types of services can be
sold, as well as being explicit about what is not allowed: sharing of third-party contact
information, sales of weapons, and anything related to terrorism.
Additional safeguards include mandatory two-factor authentication (2FA) for all vendors,
when signing up users are given a unique token to protect their account, vendor fees are
non-refundable to prevent scamming, and there are rules in place to prevent padding
accounts with fake reviews.
Like many darknet markets that operate in service of customers, WeTheNorth offers 24/7
customer service in both English and French, and it’s open to anyone who uses the site.
Vendors or buyers having trouble with the site can reach out and ask for assistance at any

1/2

time, report technical issues, vendor problems, and scams.
The types of transactions that occur on WeTheNorth are largely illegal and undermine any
appearance of legitimacy. The most popular sales are drugs such as marijuana, cocaine, and
party drugs, but WeTheNorth marketplace also allows the sale of digital products such as
stolen credit cards, login credentials, accesses, software and hardware exploits, fraud
tutorials, and more.
Insikt Group researchers discovered issues with the policing and categorization of listings on
WeTheNorth market. Many items are cross-posted and do not align with the category they
are listed under. The administrator of the site, whose contact information is also associated
with other darknet markets, has not cracked down on cross-category posting and multiple
listings, which could be an indicator that their attention is still focused elsewhere, leaving
WeTheNorth open to low-level drug sellers that wish to bypass market rules.
WeTheNorth is a new Canadian dark web marketplace that appears to be hosting a semisafe space for locals to sell illegal goods and services. There are strict rules in place and
they have banned certain categories to help the site be more legitimate and not attract a
certain clientele.
Dark web markets like WeTheNorth serve as valuable sources of cyber threat intelligence for
both private and public sector alike. Insikt Group has observed an increase in localized dark
web markets and predicts with moderate confidence that criminal underground websites
such as WeTheNorth will continue to increase as international criminals look to localize
operations and avoid international law enforcement. As law enforcement cracks down on
dark markets and threat actors move quickly to stand up replacement websites, it is
imperative for information security teams to monitor these sources for fraud, theft, and
targeting of employees, and be able to stop fraudsters and cybercriminals before they use
these tools to move through the attack chain. Recorded Future clients can access more
