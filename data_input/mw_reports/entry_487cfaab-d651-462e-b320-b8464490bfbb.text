About the webinar
On March 10, 2022 Kaspersky’s Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) shared their
insights into the current (and past) cyberattacks in Ukraine. In this post we address the
questions that we did not have the time to answer and provide the Indicators of Compromise
(IoCs) that can help you defend against the identified threats. You can watch the full
recording of the webinar here: ‘A look at current cyberattacks in Ukraine‘
The webinar included an historical overview of attacks on Ukraine; and an overview of
current cyber-activity in the country, which comprises known APT activity, unknown parties
carrying out DDoS attacks and leveraging commodity RATs, hacktivism, activities by
cybercriminals and unattributed attacks.

In the webcast, we also provided an analysis of attacks identified using Kaspersky’s
honeypot network in Ukraine; as well as an analysis of the APT attacks by Gamaredon,
Cyclops Blink, Hades/Sandworm and unknown groups, using commodity malware such as
PandoraBlade. We also looked into different wipers that have been used against
organizations in Ukraine, including HermeticWiper, WhisperGate, IsaacWiper and
HermeticRansom. We also covered unknown and unattributed attacks and hacktivist activity
taking place in the same timeframe.
We assess that the number of cyber attacks in Ukraine will increase during the next six
months. While most of the current attacks are of low complexity – such as DDoS or attacks
using commodity and low-quality tools – more sophisticated attacks exist also, and more are
expected to come. Current complex activities include the employment of HermeticWiper,
which stands out due to its sophistication, as well as the Viasat ‘cyber event’ – the partial
network outage that impacted internet service for fixed broadband customers in Ukraine and
elsewhere on the European KA-SAT network that affected over 30,000 plus terminals in
Europe.
Currently, we assess that the risk of the cyber component of this conflict spilling over to
Europe is medium-high.
We advise organizations to:
Take typical measures against DDoS attacks, ransomware and destructive malware,
phishing, targeted attacks, supply-chain attacks and firmware attacks
Make sure that any and all internet-facing systems are up-to-date with all the latest
patches installed
Install security software on endpoints
Set up extensive logging that will allow defenders to be alerted about suspicious events

Establish strict application white-listing on all machines
Actively hunt for attackers inside the company’s internal network
Integrate Threat Intelligence into SOC, EDR and leverage IOCs, YARA, Suricata and
Sigma rules. We would also refer you to Kaspersky’s Threat Intelligence Resource
Hub, which currently provides free access to independent, continuously updated and
globally-sourced information on ongoing cyberattacks and threats.

Q&A
Due to time limitations, we could not address all questions during the webinar, so here are
our answers for the remaining questions we received in the live session:
Q: What are the chances that we’ll see attacks using enterprise resources to launch
attacks?
A: Depending on the nature of the attack, actors may not differentiate between home, SMB
and enterprise systems. For example, infected IoT and network devices such as IP-cameras
may be used by anyone, and may be infected and abused by attackers to launch attacks
such as DDoS attacks. Attackers will use and abuse any resources they require in order to
conduct their attack. If this includes enterprise resources then they will be included in the
attackers scope.
Q: Currently we have seen massive connection outbreaks in many different services
over TOR-exits located in the German region. Does this provide a “true” picture of the
threat landscape, since many attackers seem to be from – in this instance – Germany
but might originate from regions that are very interested in causing damage to Europe
or Ukraine specifically right now?
A: We commonly take TOR and other anonymizing services into account when it comes to
the origin of attacks. Not all attacks, for example on our honeypot infrastructure, are easily
possible through TOR due to enforced policies on exit-nodes.
Q: I’m wondering what you can say about the attacks on Russian targets, both from
“hacktivists” and others? Can you help us separate the hype and exaggerations from
attacks that are having a real impact?
A: We have seen several public “hack” announcements. Most of them don’t include enough
evidence to confirm a real hack; nor do we have the abilities or resources to verify most of
them as they are very specific and “targeted”.
The most important suggestion is to not blindly trust all messages, reports and claims –
especially unverified content or if it’s from unverified channels/accounts.
Q: We all know of REvil group activity and the Kaseya case. REvil members were
arrested by the Russian FSB a few months ago. Do you believe that these people
might be “employed” by the Kremlin to organize an attack against Ukraine? Or you
3/6

think it might be possible to determine if any attackers are former REvil members?
A: We don’t have any insights into the employment of criminals or other threat actors; nor
into plans and strategies of any government or related organizations. Our focus is on the
technical aspects only, which is where our expertise and focus lies. The real world identity of
criminals and other threat actors is the focus area of law enforcement and related agencies.
Q: How may this conflict between Russia and Ukraine affect financial operations? Are
firewalls and antivirus tools enough to defend against a cyberattack that comes from
Europe?
A: Financial transactions and other operations are handled through the networks of financial
institutions. These are usually secured using many different methods. The origin (that is,
region or country) is usually not the first question in regards to defense, but rather technical
aspects and targets. Depending on that, particular methods and policies should be applied to
protect against attacks.
Q: Do you have any current readings on attacks on NGOs?
A: Several investigations reveal that targets include NGOs – these are accessible through
our Threat Intelligence Reporting Service.
Q: How can we use the Kaspersky honeypot and sandbox?
A: Our honeypots are not part of any Kaspersky products. They are dedicated systems
where specific sensors are installed in order to monitor attacks. However, you may join our
honeypot initiative (for details, email us at honeypots@kaspersky.com).
You may access and use the Kaspersky Sandbox within our Product & Service offerings:
Kaspersky Sandbox and Kaspersky Threat Intelligence. File analysis can also be conducted
through OpenTIP.
What follows is the list of IoCs we derived from our honeypot-sensors in Ukraine. These are
the observed, most prominent and relevant attacking IP addresses.
