WASHINGTON - The Department of Justice today announced that it has seized 63.7 bitcoins
currently valued at approximately $2.3 million. These funds allegedly represent the proceeds
of a May 8, ransom payment to individuals in a group known as DarkSide, which had
targeted Colonial Pipeline, resulting in critical infrastructure being taken out of operation. The
seizure warrant was authorized earlier today by the Honorable Laurel Beeler, U.S. Magistrate
Judge for the Northern District of California.
“Following the money remains one of the most basic, yet powerful tools we have,” said
Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco for the U.S. Department of Justice. “Ransom
payments are the fuel that propels the digital extortion engine, and today’s announcement
demonstrates that the United States will use all available tools to make these attacks more
costly and less profitable for criminal enterprises. We will continue to target the entire
ransomware ecosystem to disrupt and deter these attacks. Today’s announcements also
demonstrate the value of early notification to law enforcement; we thank Colonial Pipeline for
quickly notifying the FBI when they learned that they were targeted by DarkSide.”

“There is no place beyond the reach of the FBI to conceal illicit funds that will prevent us
from imposing risk and consequences upon malicious cyber actors,” said FBI Deputy
Director Paul Abbate. “We will continue to use all of our available resources and leverage our
domestic and international partnerships to disrupt ransomware attacks and protect our
private sector partners and the American public.”
“Cyber criminals are employing ever more elaborate schemes to convert technology into
tools of digital extortion,” said Acting U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California
Stephanie Hinds. “We need to continue improving the cyber resiliency of our critical
infrastructure across the nation, including in the Northern District of California. We will also
continue developing advanced methods to improve our ability to track and recover digital
ransom payments.”
On or about May 7, Colonial Pipeline was the victim of a highly publicized ransomware attack
resulting in the company taking portions of its infrastructure out of operation. Colonial
Pipeline reported to the FBI that its computer network was accessed by an organization
named DarkSide and that it had received and paid a ransom demand for approximately 75
bitcoins.
As alleged in the supporting affidavit, by reviewing the Bitcoin public ledger, law enforcement
was able to track multiple transfers of bitcoin and identify that approximately 63.7 bitcoins,
representing the proceeds of the victim’s ransom payment, had been transferred to a specific
address, for which the FBI has the “private key,” or the rough equivalent of a password
needed to access assets accessible from the specific Bitcoin address. This bitcoin
represents proceeds traceable to a computer intrusion and property involved in money
laundering and may be seized pursuant to criminal and civil forfeiture statutes.
The Special Prosecutions Section and Asset Forfeiture Unit of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for
the Northern District of California is handling the seizure, with significant assistance from the
Department of Justice Criminal Division’s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section
and Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, and the National Security Division’s
Counterintelligence and Export Control Section. The Department components who worked
on this seizure coordinated their efforts through the Department’s Ransomware and Digital
Extortion Task Force, which was created to combat the growing number of ransomware and
digital extortion attacks.
The Task Force prioritizes the disruption, investigation, and prosecution of ransomware and
digital extortion activity by tracking and dismantling the development and deployment of
malware, identifying the cybercriminals responsible, and holding those individuals
accountable for their crimes. The Task Force also strategically targets the ransomware
criminal ecosystem as a whole and collaborates with domestic and foreign government
agencies as well as private sector partners to combat this significant criminal threat.
