Executive Summary
On Feb. 16, 2021, Unit 42 researchers discovered attacks leveraging a number of vulnerabilities, including:
VisualDoor (a SonicWall SSL-VPN exploit).
CVE-2020-25506 (a D-Link DNS-320 firewall exploit).
CVE-2020-26919 (a Netgear ProSAFE Plus exploit).
Possibly CVE-2019-19356 (a Netis WF2419 wireless router exploit).
Three other IoT vulnerabilities yet to be identified.
On Feb. 23, 2021, one of the IPs involved in the attack was updated to serve a Mirai variant leveraging CVE-2021-27561 and
CVE-2021-27562, mere hours after vulnerability details were published. On March 3, 2021, the same samples were served
from a third IP address, with the addition of an exploit leveraging CVE-2021-22502. Furthermore, on March 13, an exploit
targeting CVE-2020-26919 was also incorporated into the samples.
The attacks are still ongoing at the time of this writing. Upon successful exploitation, the attackers try to download a malicious
shell script, which contains further infection behaviors such as downloading and executing Mirai variants and brute-forcers.
Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall customers with Threat Prevention, WildFire and URL Filtering security
subscriptions, as well as AutoFocus can detect and block all the exploit attempts from this kind of malware family.

Vulnerabilities Being Exploited
Five known vulnerabilities and three unknown vulnerabilities were exploited in this attack. Upon successful exploitation, the
wget utility is invoked to download a shell script from the malware infrastructure. The shell script then downloads several Mirai
binaries compiled for different architectures and executes these downloaded binaries one by one. Vulnerability information is
shown in Table 1, below.

Table 1. List of vulnerabilities.

Exploit Payloads
1. VisualDoor: SonicWall SSL-VPN Remote Command Injection Vulnerability

Figure 1. VisualDoor SonicWall SSL-VPN exploit payload.
The exploit of SonicWall SSL-VPN targets an old version of Bash, which is vulnerable to ShellShock. An attacker can send a
crafted Common Gateway Interface (CGI) request to a particular shell script leading to an unauthenticated remote code
execution (RCE) vulnerability.
2. CVE-2020-25506: D-Link DNS-320 Firewall Remote Command Execution Vulnerability

Figure 2. D-Link DNS-320 exploit payload.
The exploit targets a command injection vulnerability in a system_mgr.cgi component. The component does not successfully
sanitize the value of the HTTP parameters f_ntp_server, which in turn leads to arbitrary command execution.
3. CVE-2021-27561 and CVE-2021-27562: Yealink Device Management Pre-Auth ‘root’ Level Remote Code Execution
Vulnerability

Figure 3. Yealink Device exploit payload

2/13

The exploit works by chaining a pre-auth Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability and a command injection
vulnerability, making it possible to execute commands as root without authentication, simply by sending an HTTPS request to
the remote target.
4. CVE-2021-22502: Micro Focus Operation Bridge Reporter (OBR) Remote Code Execution

Figure 4. Micro Focus Operation Bridge Reporter exploit payload.
The exploit works due to the unsanitized use of the “username” and “password” parameters in requests made to the
LogonResource API. The vulnerability can be exploited to allow unauthenticated RCE as root on the OBR server.
5. CVE-2019-19356: Netis WF2419 Wireless Router Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

Figure 5. Netis WF2419 exploit payload.
The exploit targets an RCE vulnerability in a diagnostic tool utility. An authenticated attacker can perform command execution
via multiple vulnerable parameters such as IP address or domain name.
6. CVE-2020-26919: Netgear ProSAFE Plus Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

Figure 6. Netgear ProSAFE exploit payload.
The exploit targets debug web sections and an attacker can execute system commands through it. This is due to lack of
proper checks on access controls leading to RCE with administrator privileges.
7. Unidentified vulnerability (lang parameter command injection)

Figure 7. Unidentified vulnerability exploit payload.
The exploit of an unidentified vulnerability targets a command injection vulnerability in certain components. The component
does not successfully sanitize the value of the HTTP parameter lang, which in turn leads to arbitrary command execution.

3/13

8. Unidentified vulnerability (key parameter command injection)

Figure 8. Unidentified vulnerability exploit payload.
The unknown exploit targets the login CGI script, where a key parameter is not properly sanitized leading to a command
injection.
9. Unknown vulnerability (op_type parameter command injection)

Figure 9. Unidentified vulnerability exploit payload.
This exploit targets the op_type parameter, which is not properly sanitized leading to a command injection. It has been
observed in the past being used by Moobot, however the exact target is unknown.

Malware Behaviors
Binary

Functionality

lolol.sh

After deleting some key folders from the target machine (such as ones containing the existing scheduled jobs,
as well as startup scripts), this script downloads the “dark” binaries explained below, saves them to a
misleadingly named file “nginx” and tries to run each one. Since the “dark” binaries downloaded are each
compiled for a different architecture, only the one compatible with the target machine would actually execute.
Following that, it schedules a job that would (supposedly) run every hour to rerun the lolol.sh script. However,
the cron configuration is incorrect. This would have been an attempt to ensure the process is re-launched in
case it crashes or is killed for some other reason.
Finally, several packet filter rules are created to block incoming traffic directed at commonly used ports like the
standard SSH, HTTP and telnet ports, among others. This is probably to make maintenance of and remote
access to the affected system more challenging for an administrator.
In one of the two observed versions of the script, it also downloads and runs the “install.sh” script described
below.

install.sh

This script downloads GoLang v1.9.4 onto the target system and adds it to the system path. In addition, it also
installs the GoLang standard SSH package and zmap (a common network-scanning package).
It also downloads the “nbrute” binaries and the “combo.txt” file described below. As was the case for the
previous script, the “nbrute” binaries downloaded are each compiled for a different architecture, increasing the
probability of compatibility with the target machine.
Finally, zmap is run to scan port 22, and IPs found with port 22 open are sent as input to the nbrute binary.

nbrute.
[arch]

These binaries are written in GoLang and mainly serve the purpose of brute-forcing the various credentials
found in “combo.txt” while initiating an SSH connection with a certain IP.

combo.txt

Plain text file containing numerous combinations of credentials (often default credentials on devices).

dark.
[arch]

These binaries are based on the Mirai codebase, and mainly serve the purpose of propagation – either using
the exploits described in the section above, or by brute-forcing SSH connections using some hard-coded
credentials in the binary.
The key used for the standard Mirai byte-wise XOR encryption routine is 0xbaadf00d.

Conclusion
The IoT realm remains an easily accessible target for attackers. Many vulnerabilities are very easy to exploit and could, in
some cases, have catastrophic consequences. We strongly advise customers to apply patches whenever possible.
