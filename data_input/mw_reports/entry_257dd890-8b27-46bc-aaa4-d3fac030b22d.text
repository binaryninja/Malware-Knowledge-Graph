Investigating Threats in HP Sure Controller 4.2: TVRAT
HP Sure Click Enterprise captures a wealth of information about threats at the time of execution. HP Sure Controller is a management
interface that is designed to help security analysts to quickly understand the nature of threats isolated by HP Sure Click Enterprise. In this
blog post, we describe a typical investigation workflow, highlighting some of the useful features and views built into HP Sure Controller that
enable security teams to investigate threats efficiently.
Background
The attack was an attempted intrusion against a financial organisation in January 2020 that was stopped by HP Sure Click Enterprise. The
delivery method of the downloader, a malicious Microsoft Word document, was notable because the attacker disguised it as a resume and
then uploaded it to a legitimate job portal website. It was subsequently downloaded and opened by a member of the target organisation’s
human resources department, bypassing email gateway and web proxy security controls. Ultimately, the downloader delivered TVRAT (also
known as Spy-Agent), a remote access Trojan that is capable of remotely controlling an infected PC, transferring files and accessing the
victim’s microphone and webcam.
Threat Table
The threat table view lists alerts generated by HP Sure Click Enterprise. To prioritise which activity to investigate, you can apply filters to the
table by clicking on the ‘Add Filter’ button. You can also create and apply labels to alerts to organise them. Figure 1 shows a filter applied for
alerts containing high severity events that HP Sure Click Enterprise has classified as malicious (true positive) or unknown. Two alerts for
malicious Microsoft Word documents match this filter criteria.

Threat View – Summary Tab
Clicking on one of the alerts opens the threat view ‘Summary’ tab, which gives an overview of information about the alert to enable an
investigator to understand the threat quickly. The information about the alert shown on the ‘Summary’ tab includes:
the hostname of the endpoint
the user of the endpoint at the time of the activity
the names and hash values of resources that triggered the alert, e.g. filenames and URLs
the classification given by HP Sure Click Enterprise, i.e. True Positive, False Positive, Unknown
the time and duration of the activity, including if the alert was uploaded to Threat Cloud for additional analysis
MITRE ATT&CK techniques observed during the lifetime of the trace
files written to the filesystem during the lifetime of the micro-VM
DNS events
a process interaction graph showing parent-child relationships between processes
geolocation and a summary of network activity
a log of recent activity that allows HP Sure Controller users to comment on the threat
The Summary tab also allows users to download the files that triggered the alert (.VMM file) and the micro-VM trace (.XEVTS and .DEVTS
files) at the time of the activity, in case there is a need to analyse the threat using other tools.

Figure 2 – The threat view of an alert in HP Sure Controller.
The severity of this alert is ‘High’ which indicates that suspicious behaviour commonly associated with malware occurred during the lifetime of
the micro-VM.
In the ‘Resources’ section (Figure 2) a URL and a file called ResumeGabriellaGrey.doc are listed. The URL indicates that the user visited the
website then downloaded and opened the file. To the left of the filename is a grey-coloured cloud icon which indicates that the file’s hash
value is not currently recognised by Threat Cloud. However, a file called wpvnetwks.exe listed in the ‘Blacklistable Files’ section (Figure 2) is
known by Threat Cloud. It was marked as clean, as indicated by the green cloud icon. An unknown dynamic link library (DLL) was also
written to the filesystem three times during the trace:
msi.dll
KBuGDorsqg.dll
X6IPAYFwa2HOpeVE3gLRKCMb[1].dll
Looking up the hash value of wpvnetwks.exe in a malware repository such as VirusTotal reveals that the file is a legitimate digitally-signed
executable used by TeamViewer, a remote access tool. In the ‘DNS Events’ section (Figure 3) you can see that seven suspicious DNS
queries were made, including to domains associated with TeamViewer infrastructure.

Figure 3 – Continued threat view of an alert in HP Sure Controller.
The process interaction graph shows the parent-child relationships between processes created in the micro-VM and is designed to enable
investigators to identify suspicious process relationships visually. You can see that a Microsoft Word process, winword.exe, created two child
processes, wpvnetwks.exe and regsvr32.exe. Given our suspicion that wpvnetwks.exe is a file related to TeamViewer, it is unlikely that
Microsoft Word would run this program legitimately. The other process created by Microsoft Word is also highly suspicious because
regsvr32.exe is a tool that can be used to run malicious DLLs (T1117). At this stage, it seems a reasonable hypothesis that regsvr32.exe was
used to run the DLL listed in the ‘Blacklistable Files’ section.
Despite TeamViewer being a legitimate tool, the summary of the activity in this alert suggests that it was likely used for a malicious purpose.
We can inspect the micro-VM’s activity in granular detail using the other tab views to confirm this assessment.
Threat View – Graph Tab
The Graph tab displays a timeline view of the events that occurred in the micro-VM, which enables investigators to trace through activity
event by event to understand it in more detail. Clicking on an event in the left-hand column highlights it on the timeline. High severity events
are indicated by their pink-coloured background. The Graph view is often useful to understand the context of events, for example, by

examining the activity that occurred immediately before and after a high severity event.

Figure 4 – Graph view of an alert in HP Sure Controller.
In Figure 4, you can see that a high-severity event was generated when winword.exe executed wpvnetwks.exe from
C:\Users\bruser1729\AppData\Roaming\Windows Media Player\. Looking at the previous events reveals that winword.exe also launched
regsvr32.exe, which in turn ran one of the copies of the unknown DLL, KBuGDorsqg.dll. One of the libraries that wpvnetwks.exe loads at
runtime is msi.dll, a legitimate Microsoft DLL located in the System32 directory. However, the events after wpvnetwks.exe was executed
shows evidence of DLL side-loading (T1073). Another copy of the unknown DLL, msi.dll, was loaded into the process of wpvnetwks.exe
instead of the legitimate msi.dll.
Threat View – Behavioural Tab
The Behavioural tab displays micro-VM events in a chronological table and allows investigators to filter on events based on properties such
as type, action, severity and name. For example, Figure 5 shows the Behavioural view that has been filtered to only show process execution
and network events. You can see that approximately seven seconds before the high severity event, HP Sure Click Enterprise saw an HTTPS
connection to morteson[.]com (194.67.90[.]67). Afterwards, KBuGDorsqg.dll was written to the filesystem in two locations, which suggests
that the file was downloaded from morteson[.]com. The downloaded file was then run using regsvr32.exe and was shortly followed by a DNS
query to creatorz123[.]top (176.121.14[.]139), indicative of command and control (C2) check-in activity. Tracing through the events also
shows network activity relating to teamviewer[.]com, which corroborates the hypothesis that wpvnetwks.exe is a TeamViewer binary.

Threat View – Network Tab
The Network view is a table that lists all network communications that the micro-VM made during its lifetime. Figure 6 shows that
approximately 26 seconds after the triggering high severity event an HTTPS session was established to 123faster[.]top (176.121.14[.]139)
over TCP port 443. The network activity shows that roughly every minute a CONNECT method request occurred to that domain, indicating
that this session is likely the C2 connection used by the threat actor.

Threat View – Metadata Tab
The Metadata view gives information about the host that triggered the alert, such as its HP Sure Click Enterprise configuration policy and the
versions of software running on the host. This information may be relevant to identify whether an exploit affects only certain versions of
software installed within micro-VMs.

Threat View – Files Tab

7/9

The Files view is a table that lists all files that were created or modified during the lifetime of the micro-VM. If Threat Cloud is enabled, the
reputation of the files based on their hash values is checked against a database of known-good and known-bad files. Figure 8 shows that
several known-good files related to TeamViewer were written to the user’s AppData directory in a subfolder named ‘Windows Media Player’.
You can optionally blacklist a file for a device, device group or all for devices by clicking on the grey-coloured flag icon to the right of the hash
value.

Closing Thoughts
The different views in HP Sure Controller make it possible to characterise each stage of the attempted infection and obtain indicators of
compromise (IOCs) such as the domains and IP addresses of the malware’s C2 channel. Based on the information captured by HP Sure
Click Enterprise we can identify the malware as a variant of TVRAT. As you have seen from this example, the information presented in HP
Sure Controller enables security teams to efficiently investigate threats without having to re-run samples in sandboxes or resort to manual
analysis, saving time and effort.
