Current Landscape
International Relations
The Russian Federation has conducted itself in a far
more assertive manner than has previously been
observed post the fall of the Soviet Union. In 2008,
Russia engaged in open warfare with Georgia. In 2014,
Russia seized and annexed Crimea, followed by overall
intervention in Ukraine4. In 2015, Russia deployed
forces to Syria to aid the regime of Bashar al-Assad.
This was the first “out-of-area” military operation since
independence 5. There has also been bold retaliation
towards uncooperative states, most recently involving
the expulsion of 755 US diplomats from their diplomatic
posts in response to a US sanctions bill 6. Russia has

repeatedly tested defences by sending aircraft into
European airspace, and most recently staged a Naval
celebration day that included Chinese warships as part
of the demonstration. Russia desires to be seen as an
alternative to the NATO-led West for other nations.
Russia has used both economic and military power to
exert pressure. Russian state-owned gas giant Gazprom
has wielded influence over the politics and economics of
many European countries7.

Internal security posture
Putin’s leadership as President has seen marked
efforts to increase internal surveillance and controls.
This has taken the form of new legislation to “weaken
independent civic actors… with selective prosecutions
aimed at intimidating society”, “discrediting foreign-

funded groups” and efforts to “fund and promote
apolitical and pro-government organisations” 8. Freedom
House has given the country an aggregate “freedom
score” of 22 out of 100 9. Unpunished violence against
journalists has contributed to violations against media
freedom. The “Yarovaya Law” has included new powers
that provide the state authorities with the ability to
repress religious groups for the purpose of fighting
extremism 10. Legal repercussions for expressing
opinions online have also increased. As an example, in
2016 Alexsei Kungurov was sentenced to two years in a
penal colony for criticizing Russia’s actions in Syria11.

further thwart the only recently recovering
Russian economy.

National Cyber-Strategy
According to the Centre for naval Analysis
(CNA), Russian military theorists use the term
“informatsionnaya voyna,” or information warfare, over
the popular use of “cyber” or “cyberwarfare”. The national
doctrine uses a broader understanding of information
warfare, which sits along other more traditional
weapons such as “disinformation operations, PsyOps,
electronic warfare and political subversion”15. The
Swedish Defence Agency reported in 2010 that “several
organisations are responsible for handling information
warfare capabilities” whilst the FSB and the GRU are
most likely to be operating Russian
offensive and defensive capabilities16.
The FSB is believed to maintain and
operate SORM, the states internal cyber
surveillance system17.

Economy
Despite a weak external environment, the Russian
economy was predicted to grow at a rate of
1.3% in 201712. During 2016, low oil prices
and sanctions over Ukraine negatively
impacted the Russian economy before
finally taking a turn towards recovery at
the end of the year. Russia is one of the
world’s leading energy exporters, making
the fall in commodity price and high inflation
particularly tough on ordinary households13.
The Financial Times reported that Russia’s
climb out of recession has brought the
forecast for gross domestic product growth
up to 1.5%. Putin has outlined an interest
in building a “digital economy” in areas
such as “big data, artificial intelligence and
virtual reality.”14 A recent visit from the
German Chancellor Angela Merkel to Russia
highlighted the importance of cooperation
between the two countries in economic
terms. Germany features as a major import
and export partner for Russia. Despite the
topic of sanctions not being brought up,
Russia is currently having to contend with
threats from the US around fresh sanctions.
Although recovering, new sanctions could

GRU

FSB

SVR

Russia’s most recent “National Security
Strategy” does not use the term “cyber”
at all. Instead, it uses phrases such
as “information sphere,” “Information
security” and “information infrastructure”.
There are a number of entries pertaining
to the recognition of information and
communication technologies as a source
of national security risk, as well as
inferences as to the strengthening of
controls. The 2015 “Military Doctrine of
the Russian Federation” highlighted the
need “to enhance capacity and means
of information warfare” and recognised
that there are “subversive information
activities against the population,
especially young citizens of the State,
aimed at undermining historical, spiritual
and patriotic traditions related to the
defense of the Motherland”18.

Russian-Based Organised Crime
Organised crime thrives in the right ecosystem. There
is a growing body of evidence that Russian-based
organised crime (RBOC) has links to the SVR, GRU and
FSB. In the past, crime groups have been used as tools
of the state to conduct intelligence activity27. Today,
RBOC accounts for approximately a third of heroin in
Europe, a large amount of human trafficking and illegal
weapons imports. Political and business affiliations,
used to facilitate the efficacy of organised crime, have
likely helped RBOC to grow. Belarus (for example), a
key Russian export/import partner, has a large spread
of Russian community and business connections in local
politics28. The same approach has been seen between
cyber-criminals and the state security services. Talent
in the right skillsets has been notoriously difficult to
acquire globally, but not when there is already a culture
for collaboration internally between underground actors
and the state29. This approach enables Russia to conduct
operations with plausible deniability. It is also worth
noting that Russian criminals have the benefit of both
virtual and physical safe-havens. Eastern European
countries and Russia do not have extradition treaties
with the West, and as long as the criminals do not
attack Russian infrastructure they have largely been
protected30.

Interpol defines cybercrime into two different areas:
• Advanced cybercrime (or high-tech crime)
• Cyber-enabled crime
Technology and the dark web have been widely adopted
by criminals to conduct activities. This is evidenced by
the large number of online markets selling access to
drugs, weapons and other illegal products and services.
Russian carding sites follow this trend, providing access
to sensitive financial information as well as sharing tools
and tricks to help advance other would-be criminals
repertoire of abilities. This type of activity would be
categorised as cyber-enabled crime. On the other hand,
sophisticated attacks, such as those linked to Carbanak
Gang and the FIN campaigns, fall under the category of
“advanced cybercrime”. It is not difficult to draw linkages
between traditional organised crime (their advancement
in methodologies) and current trends in cybercrime.
It is therefore not surprising that such a potent region
for organised crime also has a hefty reputation for
conducting cybercrime.

Civil society and its discontents
Just as RBOC can be used to “outsource” the mission
objectives of the state, so too can hacktivism be
weaponised for motives that benefit the government.
Russia is not alone in this thought process; protest
groups and activism have been carefully interfered with
in the past by many states. The activity allows them
to enhance an agenda or justify further actions. In the
“information sphere” this has taken the guise of groups
such as the “CyberCaliphate,” which hacked into TV5
Monde in France32, and “Tsar Team” (previously linked
to apt28) leaking information about athletes’ medical
histories. The Ukrainian based “Cyber Berkut” has been a
feature of attacks against pro-European institutions and
national infrastructure during the conflict. The “Yemen
Cyber Army” (YCA) has also been accused of having been
created by the same organisation behind APT28 (FSB)33.
Information taken from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (after being hacked by the YCA) was then published
on WikiLeaks.
Psychological operations (PsyOps) and social media have
also played a role in influencing the “perceptions, attitudes
and behaviours of target populations”. This can be done by
spreading rumours, usually by exploiting already

embedded dislikes and prejudices, fear and exploiting
hopeful wishes for possible outcomes34. Russia has been
accused of using this tactic via social media to influence
the outcomes of the US elections. The activity forms a
basis for why sceptics are unsure as to why the Kremlin
would have wanted Donald Trump in the White House35.
Disinformation forms a part of this process and groups
such as Cyber-Berkut have been using strategically placed
“leaks” to further pro-Russian rhetoric36, 37. They have also
leaked information that discredits Hillary Clinton in the
past, outlining her relationship with Ukrainian billionaire
Victor Pinchuk38. The FSB 16TH Center and 18th Center
were found to be behind an internet propaganda effort
directed at Ukraine; Ukrainian news sites were controlled
by Russia and anti-Ukrainian activists39.
One way to generate mass amounts of disinformation is
the use of bots, which can be used to swamp social media.
For example, activists in Turkey and Syria were subject
to “bot spamming campaigns” in an attempt to drown out
oppositional influence40. Bot spamming was allegedly
used during the first US presidential debate, when 37.7%
of pro-Trump tweets (22.3% pro-Clinton tweets) were
suggested to have been from bots.41

Future Concerns

Balkans

In light of Russia’s assertive foreign policy and willingness
to conduct information warfare, there are some predictive
areas which may see either direct attacks or more subtle
influence:

Russia has stepped up its hybrid warfare tactics in the
Balkans. This was seen in Montenegro previous to its
recent successful application to NATO when in 2016 the
country was victim to an orchestrated coup44. Montenegro
sought support from Britain as it faced cyber-attacks
on the day the coup was supposed to take place, and
then again in February this year45. Russian media outlets
targeted Montenegro citizens with campaigns several
weeks before the Parliamentary elections in October
2016, depicting the country’s leadership as “corrupted,
bribed and a pawn of the US and NATO”46. An uptick in
Russian cyber activity is increasingly likely as NATO
deployments expand in surrounding areas, and Russian
military presence increases respectively. The Balkans
sits precariously between these rival regions of influence.
Due to the encroaching influence of NATO in the region,
and Russia’s failed attempt at dissuading Montenegro
from joining the NATO alliance, retribution in the form of
continued interference is a strong possibility. NATO was
undermined by lack of coherent support when Crimea
was annexed. Russia will attempt to posture and send a
strong signal to the Balkan region. Kosovo falls within this
vulnerable group as it has sought NATO membership as
well.

European elections
There are a number of European elections in 2017. If it
is the case that European democratic uncertainty or the
right government can help Russia achieve its strategic
goals, the likeliness of interference in the campaigns up
to and during the elections should be considered likely.
Because certain economies are more important to Russia,
it is more likely that these are the ones Moscow will be
observing carefully and attempting to manipulate. The
following elections are set to take place:
• Norwegian parliamentary election, 11 September 2017
• German federal election, 24 September 2017
• Catalan independence referendum, 1 October 2017
• Portuguese local election, 1 October 2017
• Austrian legislative election, 15 October 2017
• Czech legislative election, 20-21 October 2017
• Danish local elections, 21 November 2017
• Slovenian presidential election, November 2017
• Georgian local elections, 2017
• Estonian municipal elections, 2017
The outcome of Germany’s election will be important
as they are a substantial export and import partner.
Russia was reported to have hacked into the German
parliamentary systems in 201542 and Germany’s proimmigrant stance was also undermined by fabricated
stories of rape published in Russian media43. It would be
prudent to observe if any candidates stand out as being
more sympathetic to Moscow, or as being outliers capable
of undermining confidence and observing potential PsyOps.

Central Europe and the Baltic states
Estonia and Latvia are recognised as being particularly
vulnerable to any attempt at a Russian fuelled Hybridwar or even conventional war. They are already NATO
members, but there are concerns that Russia will seek to
use Russian minorities to gain influence47. This is likely
to take the same Modus Operandi as other previously
articulated attempts to interfere; PsyOps, electronic
attacks aimed at spreading disinformation and discrediting
or undermining current leadership. The form of
interference might be ambiguous, which serves to thwart
a confident stance from NATO and the EU. This would
further undermine the credibility of the US.

The four “Visegrad” countries (Poland, Hungary,
Czech Republic and Slovakia) are a group of Central
European nations that have a shared history, including
a communist past and Soviet occupation. Russia
exerts broad internal influence in these countries
through its regional energy policy, diplomatic activity
and information warfare. A study on the vulnerability
to subversive influence places Hungary as the most
vulnerable to “hostile foreign influence”48. In Hungary,
it appears that the ruling party “Fidesz” has positioned
itself as openly pro-Russian since 201049, 50. It is Russia’s
role in the energy sectors of these countries that helps
further their influence51. Poland is the least susceptible
to this type of influence from Russia.

The Unites States and the Kremlin
The foreign relations between the US and Russia have
turned rapidly frosty. During the first week of August
President Donald Trump signed a bill into law that
levies new sanctions on Russia. Trump has largely
been seen as a President that does not seek to label
Russia as an “enemy”52. This law however, prevents
President Trump from lifting the sanctions or returning
two US-based Russian diplomatic compounds. Russia
retaliated against the sanctions by announcing 755
American diplomatic staff are to be expelled, and two US
diplomatic properties seized53, 54. Although supported by
US congress, the decision to impose sanctions has not
been met with the same confidence in Europe. Germany
and Austria detailed concerns in a joint press release.

This is likely to be because of anxieties over the planned
“Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline”55.
The economic future of Russia, which has been markedly
affected by previous sanctions, affects other European
countries too. This conflict of interests will likely
continue as the impact of the sanctions is felt moving
forward. Because Russia seems to have felt there was
a possibility of the sanctions being lifted, the new bill
may be seen as a betrayal. As a result, it is unlikely that
Russia will cease seeking to undermine US economic
interests in Europe and abroad. This activity will likely
take a number of forms to continue Russia’s strategic
plans:
• Proxy cyber wars fought between the two regions are
a possibility in areas of strategic significance;
• Economic espionage to hinder or steal an advantage
from competing companies affected by the sanctions;
• Direct retaliation in order to exert influence over the
US and its decisions.
All possibilities are converged due to the consequences
of the sanctions in Europe. Meaning that European
countries will also have to make decisions as to their
own position, and subsequent accepted risk of retaliation
from Russia. The real impact of this issue remains to be
seen.
