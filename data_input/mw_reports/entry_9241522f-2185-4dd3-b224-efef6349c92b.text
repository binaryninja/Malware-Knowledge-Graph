Malware has become an ever-growing threat in the cyber landscape with the rise in
ransomware and as-a-service offerings. ZeroFox Threat Research has identified a change in
focus among the developers of an information stealer known as Raccoon Stealer. In this
post, we’ll take a closer look at the pivot towards protecting this information stealer through
the use of “crypters” and offer recommendations for how security teams can address this
ongoing threat.

Defining Raccoon Stealer
An information stealer (also known as an infostealer) typically acts as a Trojan designed to
gather information from a system. The most common stealers collect data such as
usernames and passwords, which it then sends to another system via email, over a network
or other means of export. Keyloggers are another popular information stealer that focuses on
logging a user’s keystrokes to uncover sensitive information and additional access.
Raccoon Stealer is an information stealer type of malware first advertised on various
underground forums in April 2019 by an actor going by the handle “raccoonstealer.” Like
most stealers, it can steal stored auto-fill data, cookies, credentials, credit card data and
history from Chromium-based browsers such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.
Targeted theft of several cryptocurrency wallets is also supported. Updates often add support
for new cryptocurrencies, though it can also be configured to locate any wallet.dat file as
well.

Its focus is on being small, efficient and simple enough for anyone to use. To accomplish
this, Raccoon Stealer was created as a service offering, complete with a cloud control panel
allowing would-be subscribers to configure everything in “just a few clicks.” At just $75 per
week or $200 per month, Raccoon Stealer is relatively cheap for threat actors as well.

Raccoon Stealer Updates Focus on Protecting Payloads
Multiple updates have happened since the start of the quarter, most notable among them
being the addition of new “crypters.” A crypter’s purpose is to obfuscate a given binary by
using tactics such as inserting junk code, breaking up the flow of code without changing the
original functionality or encrypting sections of code so static signatures cannot detect them.
Other updates include support for stealing several new cryptocurrency wallets and adding
Discord to the list of targeted applications.

On August 4, 2021, the actor raccoonstealer announced that they were looking to cooperate
with other crypter developers and had completed an “automatic system for issuing an
encrypted build.” This was seemingly in response to subscriber feedback.

The actor racoonstealer has also been observed reminding others that “usage without crypt
is prohibited.”

The recently introduced “Raccoon Clipper” was also updated at the end of July 2021, adding
support for the Monero and ZCash cryptocurrencies. Racoon Clipper is an add-on developed
separately from the main stealer and works as the name may suggest: monitoring the
Windows clipboard. Once it detects a supported cryptocurrency address, it will replace it with
one configured by the subscriber in hopes that unsuspecting victims will continue the
transaction, unaware that the target address has been changed.

The group behind Raccoon Stealer has established itself as a capable group in the two years
since they debuted, providing new features regularly and earning a primarily positive
reputation within the community. They’ve also shown a willingness to add features based on
the demands of their subscribers, as demonstrated by the recently created API for
automatically generating encrypted builds. With the development of a new API for
automatically providing obfuscated or “crypted” builds, new targeted applications and support
for more cryptocurrency wallets, this quarter has been an active one for Raccoon Stealer.

Information Stealer Resources and Recommendations
As malware attacks continue to increase and the tactics evolve, security teams must act
quickly. Here are a few recommendations from the ZeroFox Threat Research team:
When breaches occur, always change known compromised passwords, as well as
passwords on critical accounts.
If the initial attack vector is known, ensure that the vulnerabilities leveraged are
corrected immediately.
Perform a penetration test to determine weaknesses in the network configuration and
correct the findings as soon as possible.
Enable 2-factor authentication for all your organizational accounts to help mitigate
phishing and credential stuffing attacks.
Review network logs for potential signs of compromise and data egress.
Enforce administrative or application control restrictions to prevent the unauthorized
installation of software or media.
The ZeroFox team continues to produce informative resources and engaging events to help
security teams and organizations as a whole navigate unknown territory. To learn more about

increase, download the latest ZeroFox Quarterly Threat Landscape Report.
