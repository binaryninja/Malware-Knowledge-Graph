We recently discussed how cyber criminals are using the popular voice/chat client Discord to
steal cookies from the running Roblox process on a Windows PC. Since then, we’ve noticed
another attack going after the same information, only this time it is via Chrome extensions
(CRX files).
While it currently only targets Roblox users, the same technique can be used to steal cookies
from any website. The stolen information is sent via Discord, but this could also be
configured to use other chat platforms. We learned this particular Chrome extension was, in
fact, for sale on the Dream Market underground marketplace for only 99 cents:

We obtained samples of this bot using the following file names: ROBLOX
BOT.zip, Crm5extension.crx, Roblox Enhancer.crx, and DankTrades.zip. The first .ZIP file
contains a file named bgWork.js.

Searching for the terms CRM5 or bgWork.js lead right back to the forum v3rmillion.net. This
underground marketplace forum is a hotspot for Roblox hacks, where users even trade
ROBUX (the in-game currency of Roblox) for other work or products.

Looking into bgWork.js, there is a configured Discord webhook that sends out the stolen
Roblox cookie via the Discord API when installed. In this case, the example shows that the
extension is called a Trade Bot and claims to be a RAP (Recent Average Price) Value
assistant that can help you trade your ROBUX for something else. This extension doesn’t do
that; it will only send a stolen cookie to a Discord channel, leaving the user with nothing in
return.

bgWork.js will send the message via Discord using a predefined webhook, which could also
be changed to use any of the other chat platforms discussed in our paper titled How New
Chat Platforms Can Be Abused by Cybercriminals.

The extension also sets up an alarm that will trigger an event every 15 minutes. This event
will send the stolen cookie (again) through the Discord API. These alarms ensure that the
updated cookie is constantly uploaded to the attacker.

At the beginning of the bgWork.js file (where the variables are configured), the attacker can
change their webhook URL, or the cookie they want to steal. This means that this could be
used to steal any cookie that is in the web browser; this capability is new to this version.

Because CRX files are just ZIP files with a different extension, the malware can be easily
reconfigured to steal the cookies from any website besides Roblox. Changing the
extension’s manifest.json file will allow for its properties to be changed (such as its name and
description), making it more likely for an unsuspecting user to fall victim to this attack.

Unless a user looks into the extension’s code, it looks benign. It may run for a long period of
time, allowing an attacker to steal ROBUX repeatedly if the victim keeps purchasing or
acquiring new ROBUX. All it takes is one time running the extension for the ROBUX cookie
to be stolen and sent to the actor.

The extension sends the Roblox cookie to a Discord channel like the previous malware, as
seen below. We modified the code to send it to a Discord channel of our choice:

Unlike previous versions of Roblox cookie stealers like TSPY_RAPID.A and TSPY_RAPID.D
that were compiled using C#, this particular malware will also work on Macintosh computers.

The version we found required the user to manually install the extension into his Chrome
browser, which required Developer Mode to be turned on. We wondered if any of these trade
bots made it into the official Chrome web store, and found that they did:

Checking the reviews for these add-ons, we saw that some users complained that these
were stealing ROBUX. One reviewer even stated it steals the whole Roblox account.

We looked at all the Roblox trade bots that were listed in the web store, and found that all of
these were malicious; they would send your cookies to a remote Discord webhook. One of
them, once installed, even shares the same icon as the malicious extension that was
discussed earlier.

This shows that even extensions inside the Chrome web store can be malicious and steal
ROBUX from user accounts.

This is a good time to remember to always verify the permissions required before installing
any Chrome extension. If you are unsure about these permissions, it’s better to not install the
extension in the first place. This particular malicious extension requires the “Read and
change all your data on the websites you visit” permission, which should be a hint of its
malicious behavior.

Anyone who has downloaded one of these extensions should delete this extension from their
browser. This can be done via the Extension Manager within Chrome; Google provides stepby-step directions on how to do so here.
Trend Micro detects these malicious extensions as BREX_CUKIEGRAB.SM. We have
already reported these extensions to Google; as of this time they have not yet removed
them.
