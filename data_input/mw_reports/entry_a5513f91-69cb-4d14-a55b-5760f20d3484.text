Today, FUJIFILM announced that their Tokyo headquarters suffered a cyberattack Tuesday
night that they indicate is a ransomware attack.
"FUJIFILM Corporation is currently carrying out an investigation into possible unauthorized
access to its server from outside of the company. As part of this investigation, the network is
partially shut down and disconnected from external correspondence," FUJIFILM said in a
statement.
"We want to state what we understand as of now and the measures that the company has
taken. In the late evening of June 1, 2021, we became aware of the possibility of a
ransomware attack. As a result, we have taken measures to suspend all affected systems in
coordination with our various global entities."
"We are currently working to determine the extent and the scale of the issue. We sincerely
apologize to our customers and business partners for the inconvenience this has caused."
Due to the partial network outage, FUJIFILM USA has added an alert to the top of their
website stating that they are experiencing network problems that are impacting their email
and phone systems.

While FUJIFILM has not stated what ransomware group is responsible for the attack,
Advanced Intel CEO Vitali Kremez has told BleepingComputer that FUJIFILM was infected
with the Qbot trojan last month.
"Based on our unique threat prevention platform Andariel, FUJIFILM Corporate appeared to
be infected with Qbot malware based on May 15, 2021," Kremez told BleepingComputer.
"Since the underground ransomware turmoil, the Qbot malware group currently works with
the REvil ransomware group."
"A network infection attributed to QBot automatically results in risks associated with future
ransomware attacks."

The operators of the Qbot trojan have a long history of working with ransomware operations
to provide remote access to compromised networks.
In the past, the ProLock and Egregor ransomware gangs partnered with Qbot, but with the
shutdown of those operations, the REvil ransomware operation has been utilizing the botnet.
While ransomware has been active since 2012, it has recently gained worldwide attention
after the attacks on Colonial Pipeline, the US's largest fuel pipeline, and the world's largest
beef producer, JBS.
The US government has created a ransomware task force to recommend new policies and
guidelines for battling the growing threat.
