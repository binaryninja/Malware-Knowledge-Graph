Abraham's Ax Likely Linked to Moses Staff

Both personas are likely operated by the Iranian COBALT SAPLING threat group. Thursday,
January 26, 2023 By: Counter Threat Unit Research Team
Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers investigated similarities between
the Moses Staff hacktivist group persona that emerged in September 2021 and the
Abraham's Ax persona that emerged in November 2022. The analysis revealed several
commonalities across the iconography, videography, and leak sites used by the groups,
suggesting they are likely operated by the same entity. CTU™ analysis indicates that
Abraham's Ax is another hacktivist group persona operated by the Iranian COBALT
SAPLING threat group.
Abraham's Ax announced their existence and mission through social media channels such
as Twitter posts on November 8, 2022. The group's iconography is reminiscent of Moses
Staff (see Figure 1). The Moses Staff logo shows an arm extended from a sleeve holding a
staff with a clenched fist. Abraham's Ax shows a clenched fist holding an axe from a different
perspective. Both illustrations use a similar style.

Abraham's Ax and Moses Staff use a WordPress blog as the basis for their leak sites.
Although the overall aesthetics are different, there are clear connections in their operations.
Both sites offer multiple languages. Moses Staff is available in Hebrew and English, while
Abraham's Ax is available in Hebrew, Farsi, and English. Both sites provide versions

available via Tor websites, although the Abraham's Ax site appeared to be under
construction at the time of analysis. Both use domains registered with EgenSajt . se (see
Table 1).

Although the threat actors registered .nu and .se domains that use the abrahams-ax name,
the group appears to use the .nu version in promotional material (see Figure 2). The
abrahams-ax . nu domain was registered approximately three weeks before the group
emerged publicly.

CTU analysis of the hosting infrastructure for the Moses Staff and Abraham's Ax leak sites
revealed that at early points in their lifecycles, both sites were hosted in the same subnet,
nearly adjacent to each other (see Figure 3). This is highly unlikely to occur by coincidence
and strongly indicates that the same entity chose to host the two sites in near contiguous IP
address space.

Moses Staff claims to be anti-Israeli and pro-Palestinian and encourages leak site visitors to
take part in "exposing the crimes of the Zionists in occupied Palestine." Moses Staff posted
16 "activities" to their site as of December 2. The leaked information is predominantly data
sets stolen from Israeli companies but also includes compilations of personal information on
individuals affiliated with Israel's signals intelligence Unit 8200. Some of the intrusions have
been confirmed, although it is likely that Moses Staff embellished the nature and extent of
the compromises. The threat actors have reportedly used the custom PyDCrypt loader and
DCSrv cryptographic wiper. DCSrv encrypts data using the open-source DiskCryptor library
and installs a custom bootloader message. Although the wiper is styled as ransomware, the
threat actors do not make a serious attempt to extort a ransom payment. The attacks appear
to be politically motivated and focused on disruption and intimidation. The StrifeWater remote
access trojan (RAT) (also known as brokerhost.exe) has also been linked to the group based
on technical overlaps between intrusions, such as the use of the same customized ASPX
web shells. An auxiliary tool named DriveGuard has been deployed alongside StrifeWater to
monitor its execution. Malware artifacts indicate that COBALT SAPLING has been operating
since at least November 2020 (see Figure 4), even though the Moses Staff persona did not
emerge until September 2021.

Like Moses Staff, Abraham's Ax uses a biblical figure as the basis of their persona and
includes religious quotes throughout their site. However, Abraham's Ax states they are
operating on behalf of the Hezbollah Ummah. Hezbollah is a Lebanese Shia Islamist political
party and militant group that is backed by Iran. Ummah refers to a Muslim community. As of
this publication, there is no evidence to suggest that Abraham's Ax is linked to Hezbollah.
Rather than attacking Israel directly, Abraham's Ax attacks government ministries in Saudi
Arabia. They published sample data allegedly stolen from attacks on the Ministry of the
Interior, along with a video that purportedly presents intercepted phone conversations
between Saudi Arabian government ministers. The group may be attacking Saudi Arabia in
response to Saudi Arabia's leadership role in improving relationships between Israel and
Arab nations. In June 2022, media reports described secret talks regarding potential air
defense collaborations, which Iran perceived as a significant threat to its interests in the
region. Progress on normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel is fragile, and
Iran may see these attacks as a way to discourage those efforts.
Moses Staff and Abraham's Ax have both produced and released videos as part of their
operations. The videos often depict Hollywood-style hacking involving satellites, CCTV, 3D
building models, and fast scrolling through documents allegedly stolen as part of their
operations. Some videos depict multiple mobile phones combined with audio playback to
suggest that mobile phone calls of senior government officials were intercepted. The video
files released by the two groups show clear repetition and evolution of visual themes. The
comparison of video screen captures in Figure 5 shows strong similarities between the
groups. The Abraham's Ax videos use several of the same stock video elements used by
Moses Staff but include additional visual embellishments. One odd addition to the
background of Abraham's Ax videos is scrolling text taken from a 2015 news report on
former British Prime Minister David Cameron visiting a factory in the UK. This selection
appears incongruent with the visual theme and message of the overall campaign.

The Abraham's Ax persona does not appear to be a direct replacement for Moses Staff. The
Moses Staff leak site and Telegram channels remained active following Abraham Ax's
emergence. In late November, Moses Staff claimed to have compromised a CCTV system
that monitored the site of a terrorist attack in Israel, releasing previously unseen footage of
the explosion. Malware and technical indicators from Abraham's Ax operations have not
been identified. Assuming that both personas are operated by COBALT SAPLING, it is
plausible that the threat actors use the same tools and techniques in their intrusions.
To mitigate exposure to this malware, CTU researchers recommend that organizations use
available controls to review and restrict access using the indicators listed in Table 2. Note
that IP addresses can be reallocated. The domains and IP addresses may contain malicious
content, so consider the risks before opening them in a browser.
