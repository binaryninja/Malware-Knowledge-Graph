North Korean Hacking Team Responsible for Global WannaCry 2.0
Ransomware, Destructive Cyberattack on Sony Pictures, Central
Bank Cybertheft in Bangladesh, and Other Malicious Activities
A criminal complaint was unsealed today charging Park Jin Hyok (박진혁; a/k/a Jin Hyok
Park and Pak Jin Hek), a North Korean citizen, for his involvement in a conspiracy to conduct
multiple destructive cyberattacks around the world resulting in damage to massive amounts
of computer hardware, and the extensive loss of data, money and other resources (the
“Conspiracy”).
The complaint alleges that Park was a member of a government-sponsored hacking team
known to the private sector as the “Lazarus Group,” and worked for a North Korean
government front company, Chosun Expo Joint Venture (a/k/a Korea Expo Joint Venture or
“KEJV”), to support the DPRK government’s malicious cyber actions.

1/5

The Conspiracy’s malicious activities include the creation of the malware used in the 2017
WannaCry 2.0 global ransomware attack; the 2016 theft of $81 million from Bangladesh
Bank; the 2014 attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE); and numerous other attacks or
intrusions on the entertainment, financial services, defense, technology, and virtual currency
industries, academia, and electric utilities.
The charges were announced by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, FBI Director Christopher A.
Wray, Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers, First Assistant
United States Attorney for the Central District of California Tracy Wilkison and Assistant
Director in Charge Paul D. Delacourt of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office.
In addition to these criminal charges, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced today
that the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated
Park and KEJV under Executive Order 13722 based on the malicious cyber and cyberenabled activity outlined in the criminal complaint.
“Today’s announcement demonstrates the FBI’s unceasing commitment to unmasking and
stopping the malicious actors and countries behind the world’s cyberattacks,” said FBI
Director Christopher Wray. “We stand with our partners to name the North Korean
government as the force behind this destructive global cyber campaign. This group’s actions
are particularly egregious as they targeted public and private industries worldwide – stealing
millions of dollars, threatening to suppress free speech, and crippling hospital systems. We’ll
continue to identify and illuminate those responsible for malicious cyberattacks and
intrusions, no matter who or where they are.”
“The scale and scope of the cyber-crimes alleged by the Complaint is staggering and
offensive to all who respect the rule of law and the cyber norms accepted by responsible
nations,” said Assistant Attorney General Demers. “The Complaint alleges that the North
Korean government, through a state-sponsored group, robbed a central bank and citizens of
other nations, retaliated against free speech in order to chill it half a world away, and created
disruptive malware that indiscriminately affected victims in more than 150 other countries,
causing hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars’ worth of damage. The investigation,
prosecution, and other disruption of malicious state-sponsored cyber activity remains among
the highest priorities of the National Security Division and I thank the FBI agents, DOJ
prosecutors, and international partners who have put years of effort into this investigation.”
“The complaint charges members of this North Korean-based conspiracy with being
responsible for cyberattacks that caused unprecedented economic damage and disruption to
businesses in the United States and around the globe,” said First Assistant United States
Attorney Tracy Wilkison. “The scope of this scheme was exposed through the diligent efforts
of FBI agents and federal prosecutors who were able to unmask these sophisticated crimes
through sophisticated means. They traced the attacks back to the source and mapped their
commonalities, including similarities among the various programs used to infect networks
across the globe. These charges send a message that we will track down malicious actors
2/5

no matter how or where they hide. We will continue to pursue justice for those responsible for
the huge monetary losses and attempting to compromise the national security of the United
States.”
“We will not allow North Korea to undermine global cybersecurity to advance its interests and
generate illicit revenues in violation of our sanctions,” said Treasury Secretary Steven
Mnuchin. “The United States is committed to holding the regime accountable for its cyberattacks and other crimes and destabilizing activities.”
Park is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, which
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and one count of conspiracy to commit
wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.
About the Defendant Park and Chosun Expo Joint Venture
According to the allegations contained in the criminal complaint, which was filed on June 8,
2018 in Los Angeles federal court, and posted today: Park Jin Hyok, was a computer
programmer who worked for over a decade for Chosun Expo Joint Venture (a/k/a Korea
Expo Joint Venture or “KEJV”). Chosun Expo Joint Venture had offices in China and the
DPRK, and is affiliated with Lab 110, a component of DPRK military intelligence. In addition
to the programming done by Park and his group for paying clients around the world, the
Conspiracy also engaged in malicious cyber activities. Security researchers that have
independently investigated these activities referred to this hacking team as the “Lazarus
Group.” The Conspiracy’s methods included spear-phishing campaigns, destructive malware
attacks, exfiltration of data, theft of funds from bank accounts, ransomware extortion, and
propagating “worm” viruses to create botnets.
The Conspiracy’s Cyber Attacks, Heists, and Intrusions
The complaint describes a broad array of the Conspiracy’s alleged malicious cyber activities,
both successful and unsuccessful, and in the United States and abroad, with a particular
focus on four specific examples.
Targeting the Entertainment Industry
In November 2014, the conspirators launched a destructive attack on Sony Pictures
Entertainment (SPE) in retaliation for the movie “The Interview,” a farcical comedy that
depicted the assassination of the DPRK’s leader. The conspirators gained access to SPE’s
network by sending malware to SPE employees, and then stole confidential data, threatened
SPE executives and employees, and damaged thousands of computers. Around the same
time, the group sent spear-phishing messages to other victims in the entertainment industry,
including a movie theater chain and a U.K. company that was producing a fictional series
involving a British nuclear scientist taken prisoner in DPRK.
Targeting Financial Services
3/5

In February 2016, the Conspiracy stole $81 million from Bangladesh Bank. As part of the
cyber-heist, the Conspiracy accessed the bank’s computer terminals that interfaced with the
Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) communication
system after compromising the bank’s computer network with spear-phishing emails, then
sent fraudulently authenticated SWIFT messages directing the Federal Reserve Bank of NY
to transfer funds from Bangladesh to accounts in other Asian countries. The Conspiracy
attempted to and did gain access to several other banks in various countries from 2015
through 2018 using similar methods and “watering hole attacks,” attempting the theft of at
least $1 billion through such operations.
Targeting of U.S. Defense Contractors
In 2016 and 2017, the Conspiracy targeted a number of U.S. defense contractors, including
Lockheed Martin, with spear-phishing emails. These malicious emails used some of the
same aliases and accounts seen in the SPE attack, at times accessed from North Korean IP
addresses, and contained malware with the same distinct data table found in the malware
used against SPE and certain banks, the complaint alleges. The spear-phishing emails sent
to the defense contractors were often sent from email accounts that purported to be from
recruiters at competing defense contractors, and some of the malicious messages made
reference to the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system
deployed in South Korea. The attempts to infiltrate the computer systems of Lockheed
Martin, the prime contractor for the THAAD missile system, were not successful.
Creation of Wannacry 2.0
In May 2017, a ransomware attack known as WannaCry 2.0 infected hundreds of thousands
of computers around the world, causing extensive damage, including significantly impacting
the United Kingdom’s National Health Service. The Conspiracy is connected to the
development of WannaCry 2.0, as well as two prior versions of the ransomware, through
similarities in form and function to other malware developed by the hackers, and by
spreading versions of the ransomware through the same infrastructure used in other cyberattacks.
Park and his co-conspirators were linked to these attacks, intrusions, and other malicious
cyber-enabled activities through a thorough investigation that identified and traced: email and
social media accounts that connect to each other and were used to send spear-phishing
messages; aliases, malware “collector accounts” used to store stolen credentials; common
malware code libraries; proxy services used to mask locations; and North Korean, Chinese,
and other IP addresses. Some of this malicious infrastructure was used across multiple
instances of the malicious activities described herein. Taken together, these connections
and signatures—revealed in charts attached to the criminal complaint—show that the attacks
and intrusions were perpetrated by the same actors.
Accompanying Mitigation Efforts
4/5

Throughout the course of the investigation, the FBI and the Department provided specific
information to victims about how they had been targeted or compromised, as well as
information about the tactics and techniques used by the conspiracy with the goals of
remediating any intrusion and preventing future intrusions. That direct sharing of information
took place in the United States and in foreign countries, often with the assistance of foreign
law enforcement partners. The FBI also has collaborated with certain private cybersecurity
companies by sharing and analyzing information about the intrusion patterns used by the
members of the conspiracy.
In connection with the unsealing of the criminal complaint, the FBI and prosecutors provided
cybersecurity providers and other private sector partners detailed information on accounts
used by the Conspiracy in order to assist these partners in their own independent
investigative activities and disruption efforts.
The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided
here for informational purposes only, as any sentencings of the defendant will be determined
by the assigned judge.
This case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Stephanie S.
Christensen, Anthony J. Lewis, and Anil J. Antony of the United States Attorney’s Office for
the Central District of California, and DOJ Trial Attorneys David Aaron and Scott Claffee of
the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section. The
Criminal Division’s Office of International Affairs provided assistance throughout this
investigation, as did many of the FBI’s Legal Attachés, and foreign authorities around the
world.
The charges contained in the criminal complaint are merely accusations and the defendant is
presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.
