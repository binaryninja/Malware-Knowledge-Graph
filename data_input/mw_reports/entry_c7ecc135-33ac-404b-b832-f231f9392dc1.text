Cisco 2016 Annual Security Report

Executive Summary

Executive Summary

Security professionals must rethink their defense strategies.
Adversaries and defenders are both developing technologies
and tactics that are growing in sophistication. For their part,
bad actors are building strong back-end infrastructures
with which to launch and support their campaigns. Online
criminals are refining their techniques for extracting money
from victims and for evading detection even as they continue
to steal data and intellectual property.
The Cisco 2016 Annual Security Report—which presents
research, insights, and perspectives from Cisco Security
Research—highlights the challenges that defenders face
in detecting and blocking attackers who employ a rich
and ever-changing arsenal of tools. The report also
includes research from external experts, such as Level 3
Threat Research Labs, to help shed more light on current
threat trends.
We take a close look at data compiled by Cisco researchers
to show changes over time, provide insights on what this
data means, and explain how security professionals should
respond to threats.

In this report, we present and discuss:
THREAT INTELLIGENCE
This section examines some of the most compelling trends
in cybersecurity as identified by our researchers as well
as updates on web attack vectors, web attack methods,
and vulnerabilities. It also includes a more extensive look
into growing threats such as ransomware. To produce
its analysis of observed trends in 2015, Cisco Security
Research used a global set of telemetry data.

INDUSTRY INSIGHTS
This section examines security trends affecting enterprises,
including the growing use of encryption and the potential
security risks it presents. We look at the weaknesses in
how small and midsize businesses (SMBs) are protecting
their networks. And we present research on enterprises
relying on outdated, unsupported, or end-of-life software
to support their IT infrastructure.
SECURITY CAPABILITIES BENCHMARK STUDY
This section covers the results of Cisco’s second Security
Capabilities Benchmark study, which focused on security
professionals’ perceptions of the state of security in their
organizations. In comparing 2015 survey results with
those of 2014, Cisco found that chief security officers
(CSOs) and security operations (SecOps) managers are
less confident that their security infrastructure is up to
date, or that they are able to thwart attacks. However,
the survey also indicates that enterprises are stepping
up training and other security processes in a bid to
strengthen their networks. The study’s findings are
exclusive to the Cisco 2016 Annual Security Report.
A LOOK FORWARD
This section offers a view of the geopolitical landscape
affecting security. We discuss findings from two
Cisco studies—one examining executives’ concerns
about cybersecurity, and the other focusing on IT
decision-makers’ perceptions about security risk and
trustworthiness. We also give an update on our progress
in reducing time to detection (TTD), and underscore
the value of moving to an integrated threat defense
architecture as a way to combat threats.

Major Developments and Discoveries

Major Developments
and Discoveries

Cybercriminals have refined their back-end infrastructures to
carry out attacks in ways that increase efficiency and profits.
•• Cisco, with help from Level 3 Threat Research Labs
and cooperation from the hosting provider Limestone
Networks, identified and sidelined the largest Angler
exploit kit operation in the United States, which was
targeting 90,000 victims per day and generating tens
of millions of dollars annually for the threat actors
behind the campaign.
•• SSHPsychos (Group 93), one of the largest distributed
denial of service (DDoS) botnets ever observed by
Cisco researchers, was significantly weakened by the
combined efforts of Cisco and Level 3 Threat Research
Labs. Like the Angler case study mentioned above, this
success points to the value of industry collaboration to
combat attackers.
•• Malicious browser extensions can be a major source
of data leakage for businesses and are a widespread
problem. We estimate that more than 85 percent of
organizations studied are affected by malicious
browser extensions.
•• Well-known botnets like Bedep, Gamarue, and Miuref
represented the majority of botnet command-andcontrol activity affecting one group of organizations
we analyzed in July 2015.

•• Cisco’s analysis of malware validated as “known bad”
found that the majority of that malware—91.3 percent—
uses the Domain Name Service (DNS) to carry out
campaigns. Through retrospective investigation into
DNS queries, Cisco uncovered “rogue” DNS resolvers
in use on customer networks. The customers were
not aware that the resolvers were being used by their
employees as part of their DNS infrastructure.
•• Adobe Flash vulnerabilities continue to be popular
with cybercriminals. However, software vendors
are reducing the risk that users will be exposed to
malware through Flash technology.
•• Observing the trends in 2015, our researchers suggest
that HTTPS-encrypted traffic has reached a tipping
point: it will soon become the dominant form of
Internet traffic. Although encryption can help protect
consumers, it also can undermine the effectiveness
of security products, making it more difficult for the
security community to track threats. Adding to the
challenge, some malware may initiate encrypted
communications across a diverse set of ports.
•• Bad actors are making use of compromised websites
created by the popular web development platform
WordPress for their criminal activities. There, they can
marshal server resources and evade detection.

5

Cisco 2016 Annual Security Report

•• Aging infrastructure is growing and leaves
organizations increasingly vulnerable to compromise.
We analyzed 115,000 Cisco devices on the Internet
and discovered that 92 percent of the devices
in our sample were running software with known
vulnerabilities. In addition, 31 percent of the Cisco
devices in the field that were included in our analysis
are “end of sale” and 8 percent are “end of life.”
•• In 2015, security executives showed lower confidence
in their security tools and processes than they did in
2014, according to Cisco’s 2015 Security Capabilities
Benchmark Study. For example, in 2015, 59 percent
of organizations said their security infrastructure was
“very up to date.” In 2014, 64 percent said the same.
However, their growing concerns about security are
motivating them to improve their defenses.

Major Developments and Discoveries

•• The benchmark study shows that small and midsize
businesses (SMBs) use fewer defenses than larger
enterprises. For example, 48 percent of SMBs said
in 2015 that they used web security, compared to
59 percent in 2014. And 29 percent said they used
patching and configuration tools in 2015, compared
with 39 percent in 2014. Such weaknesses can place
SMBs’ enterprise customers at risk, since attackers
may more easily breach SMB networks.
•• Since May 2015, Cisco has reduced the median time
to detection (TTD) of known threats in our networks to
about 17 hours—less than one day. This far outpaces
the current industry estimate for TTD, which is
100 to 200 days.

Eye on the Prize:
For Modern Cybercriminals,
Making Money Is Paramount
In the past, many online criminals lurked in the shadows
of the Internet. They tried to avoid detection by making
only brief incursions into enterprise networks to launch
their exploits. Today, some emboldened cybercriminals are
tapping into legitimate online resources. They leach server
capacity, steal data, and demand ransoms from online
victims whose information they hold hostage.
These campaigns are a sobering escalation in the war
between defenders and attackers. If adversaries find more
places online from which to operate, then their impact can
grow exponentially.
In this report, Cisco security researchers highlight the
tactics that threat actors use to build a solid infrastructure—
to make their campaigns stronger and more effective.
Adversaries continue to adopt more efficient methods for
boosting their profits—and many are paying special attention
to harnessing server resources.

The explosion in ransomware (see page 10) is a prime
example. Ransomware provides criminals with an easy
way to extract more money directly from users. When
adversaries establish campaigns that compromise tens of
thousands of users per day with little or no interruption, the
“paycheck” for their efforts can be staggering. In addition
to developing better ways to monetize their campaigns,
attackers are encroaching on legitimate resources as
staging grounds.
Creators of some ransomware variants as well as
developers of other exploits are now shifting traffic to
hacked WordPress websites as a way to avoid detection
and use server space (see page 33). And the perpetrators
of SSHPsychos, one of the largest botnets ever seen
by Cisco researchers, operated on standard networks
with little interference, until a combined takedown effort
by Cisco and Level 3 Threat Research Labs persuaded
service providers to block the botnet creator’s traffic.

Cisco has assembled and analyzed a global set of telemetry data for
this report. Our ongoing research and analysis of discovered threats,
such as malware traffic, can provide insights on possible future criminal
behavior and aid in the detection of threats.
Featured Stories
Industry Collaboration Helps Cisco Sideline Far-Reaching and
Highly Profitable Exploit Kit and Ransomware Campaign
The Angler exploit kit is one of the largest and most
effective exploit kits on the market. It has been linked to
several high-profile malvertising (malicious advertising) and
ransomware campaigns. And it has been a major factor
in the overall explosion of ransomware activity that our
threat researchers have been monitoring closely for the
past several years. Miscreants use ransomware to encrypt
users’ files, providing the keys for decryption only after
users pay a “ransom”—usually in the $300 to $500 range.
As reported in the Cisco 2015 Midyear Security Report,
cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and anonymization networks
such as Tor make it easy for adversaries to enter the
malware market and quickly begin generating revenue.
Ransomware’s rise in popularity can be tied to two main
advantages: It is a low-maintenance operation for threat
actors, and it offers a quick path to monetization because
the users pay adversaries directly in cryptocurrencies.
Through research of Angler and related ransomware trends,
Cisco determined that some operators of the exploit kit were
using an inordinate percentage of worldwide proxy servers for
Angler that were on servers operated by Limestone Networks.
This server use is a prime example of another trend that our
researchers have been observing in the shadow economy
of late: threat actors commingling legitimate and malicious
resources to carry out their campaigns.

SHARE

In this case, the IP infrastructure supporting Angler was
not large. The daily number of active systems generally
hovered between 8 and 12. Most were active for only one
day. Figure 1 shows the number of unique IP addresses
that Cisco observed throughout July 2015.
Cisco found that Angler operators were essentially
rolling through IP addresses in a linear fashion to conceal
the
threat
Figure
X.activity and to prevent any interruption to
their
moneymaking.

As Figure 2 illustrates, Angler starts with an IP address
(here, 74.63.217.218). As the system compromises users
and generates “noise” that defenders begin to detect, the
adversaries shift to an adjacent IP address (74.63.217.219).
This activity continues through near-contiguous blocks of IP
space from a single hosting provider.
Cisco examined the IP information to identify the autonomous
system numbers (ASNs) and the providers associated with the
IP addresses. We determined that most of the Angler-related
traffic was coming from servers operated by two legitimate
hosting providers: Limestone Networks and Hetzner
(Figure 3). They accounted for almost 75 percent of the
overall volume of traffic for the month of July.
Cisco reached out first to Limestone Networks, which
appeared to be hosting the largest global portion of
Angler. Limestone embraced the opportunity to collaborate.
The company had been dealing with excessive credit card
chargebacks every month because adversaries were using
fraudulent names and credit cards to buy random batches
of their servers worth thousands of dollars.

Cisco 2016 Annual Security Report

To investigate this activity, Cisco enlisted help from
Level 3 Threat Research Labs as well as from OpenDNS,
a Cisco company. Level 3 Threat Research Labs was able
to provide greater global insight into the threat, giving
Cisco the ability to see a little deeper into the scope of
the threat and how far-reaching it was at its peak. OpenDNS,
meanwhile, provided a unique look at the domain activity
associated with the threat, giving Cisco a more complete
understanding of how techniques like domain shadowing
were being incorporated by the adversaries.
Cisco threat researchers then looked into how, specifically,
users were encountering Angler and subsequently being
served malicious payloads. The researchers observed
popular websites redirecting users to the Angler exploit kit
through malvertising. The false ads were placed on hundreds
of major news, real estate, and popular culture sites. These
types of sites are commonly referred to in the security
community as “known good” sites.
Additionally, Cisco threat researchers found countless
examples of small, seemingly random websites doing
the same type of redirection, including a single person’s
obituary from a small, rural newspaper in the United States.
More than likely, the latter strategy was designed to target
elderly people. This population is generally more likely to use
default web browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer and
are less likely to be aware of the need to regularly patch
Adobe Flash vulnerabilities.
Another notable aspect of this Angler operation was the
volume of unique referers and the low frequency with which
they were used (Figure 4). We found more than 15,000
unique sites pushing people to the Angler exploit kit,
99.8 percent of which were used fewer than 10 times. Most
of the referers were therefore active only for a short period

and were removed after a handful of users were targeted.
In our July 2015 analysis, we noted that the peaks in activity
coincided with the various Hacking Team zero-day exploits
1
(CVE-2015-5119,
Figure
X. UniqueCVE-2015-5122).

The adversaries’ approach to purchasing the servers made
it difficult to associate the fraudulent activity with a single
actor. For example, a miscreant might buy three or four
servers on one day, and then use a different name and
credit card to purchase three or four servers the next day.
In this way, they could essentially “roll” from one IP address
to the next when compromised servers were identified and
taken offline by defenders.

Cisco determined that about 60 percent of the Angler
payloads delivered through this particular operation were
delivering some type of ransomware variant, the majority
being Cryptowall 3.0. Other types of payloads included
Bedep, a malware downloader that is commonly used
to install click-fraud campaign malware. (See “Browser
Infections: Widespread—and a Major Source of Data
Leakage,” page 16.) Both types of malware are designed to
help adversaries make a lot of money from compromised
users very quickly, and with little or no effort.

According to Cisco’s research, the primary actor
responsible for about half of the Angler exploit kit activity in
this particular campaign was targeting up to 90,000 victims
per day. By our estimation, the campaign was netting the
adversaries more than $30 million annually.

SHARE

Presumably, the network out of Hetzner had a similar
success rate. That means the threat actor behind the
operation involving the Limestone Networks and Hetzner
servers was responsible for half of all global Angler activity
at the time of Cisco’s analysis. Cisco researchers estimate
that this operation was capable of generating gross
income of $60 million per year.

Cisco also discovered that the servers that the users were
connecting to did not actually host any of the malicious
Angler activity. They were serving as a conduit. A user
would get into the redirection chain and submit a GET
request for a landing page, which would land on the proxy
server. The proxy server would route the traffic to an exploit
server in a different country, on a different provider. During
our research, we found that a single exploit server was
associated with multiple proxy servers. (See Figure 5.)
Cisco identified a status server that was handling tasks
such as health monitoring. Every single proxy server that
the status server was monitoring had a pair of unique URLs.
If the path was queried, the status server would return
an HTTP status code “204” message. The adversaries
could uniquely identify each proxy server and make sure
it not only was operating, but also that defenders had not
tampered with it. Using the other URL, the attackers could
collect the logs from the proxy server and determine how
efficiently their network was operating.
Industry collaboration was a critical component in Cisco’s
ability to investigate the Angler exploit kit activity. Ultimately,
it helped stop redirects to the Angler proxy servers on
a U.S. service provider and bring awareness to a highly
sophisticated cybercrime operation that was affecting
thousands of users every day.

SHARE

Cisco worked closely with Limestone Networks to identify
new servers as they were brought online and monitored
them closely to make sure they were taken down. After
a while the adversaries moved away from Limestone
Networks, and a global decrease in Angler activity followed.

For more information on how Cisco disrupted a
significant international revenue stream generated
by the Angler exploit kit, read the Cisco Security
blog post “Threat Spotlight: Cisco Talos
Thwarts Access to Massive International
Exploit Kit Generating $60M Annually from
Ransomware Alone.”

Coordinated Industry Effort Helps
Cripple One of the Internet’s Largest
DDoS Botnets
Integrated threat defense technologies can often halt major
attacks before they affect enterprise networks. However,
in many cases, bringing down a potentially massive
attack requires not only technological defenses, but also
coordination among service providers, security vendors,
and industry groups.
As criminals become even more serious about monetizing
their activities, the technology industry needs to do a
better job of partnering to take down criminal campaigns.
SSHPsychos (also called Group 93), one of the largest
DDoS botnets ever observed by Cisco security
researchers, was significantly weakened after Cisco
collaborated with Level 3 Threat Research Labs.
14

Cisco 2016 Annual Security Report

Threat Intelligence

UNIQUE THREAT
The SSHPsychos DDoS network is a unique threat for
several reasons. Because it enlists tens of thousands of
machines distributed across the Internet, it has the power
to launch a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack
that cannot be addressed on a device-by-device basis. In
this case, the botnet was being created using brute-force
attacks involving secure shell (SSH) traffic (Figure 6).
The SSH protocol is used to allow secure communications,
and it is commonly used for the remote administration of
systems. At times, SSHPsychos accounted for more than
35 percent of all global Internet SSH traffic (Figure 7),
according to analysis by Cisco and Level 3.

SSHPsychos is operational in two countries: China and
the United States. The brute-force login attempts,
using 300,000 unique passwords, originated from a hosting
provider based in China. When adversaries were able to log
in by guessing the correct root password, the brute-force
attacks ceased. Twenty-four hours later, adversaries then
logged in from a U.S. IP address and installed a DDoS
rootkit to the affected machine. This was clearly a tactic to
reduce suspicion from network administrators. The botnet’s
targets varied, but in many cases appeared to be large
Internet service providers (ISPs).

COLLABORATING WITH SECURITY EXPERTS
Because of the scale of the DDoS network, our researchers
believed that the damage would be difficult to contain. It
was essential to work in tandem with an organization that
could remove the brute-forcing group from the Internet
effectively. However, backbone providers are hesitant to
filter their customers’ content.
Cisco reached out to Level 3 Threat Research Labs.
Level 3 analyzed the traffic at the netblock, or range of
IP addresses, where SSHPsychos was thought to reside
(103.41.124.0/23). It confirmed that no legitimate traffic
was originating from, or destined for, that address. It nullrouted the network traffic within its own networks. Then it
contacted service providers for the relevant domains to ask
them to remove the network’s traffic.
The results of this effort were seen immediately (Figure 8).
The original network showed almost no new activity.
However, a new network at netblock 43.255.190.0/23
showed large amounts of SSH brute-force attack traffic.
It had the same behavior that was associated with
SSHPsychos. Following this sudden re-emergence of
SSHPsychos-like traffic, Cisco and Level 3 decided to
take action against 103.41.124.0/23, as well as the new
netblock 43.255.190.0/23.
Taking down the netblocks used by SSHPsychos did
not permanently disable the DDoS network. However,
it certainly slowed down its creators’ ability to run their
operations, and it prevented SSHPsychos from spreading
to new machines, at least temporarily.

Threat Intelligence

As cybercriminals build large attack networks, the security
industry must explore ways to collaborate when faced
with a threat such as SSHPsychos. Top-level domain
providers, ISPs, hosting providers, DNS resolvers, and
security vendors can no longer sit on the sidelines when
online criminals launch their exploits on networks that are
intended to carry only legitimate traffic. In other words,
when criminals deliver malicious traffic in what is more or
less plain sight, the industry must remove the malicious
pathways to these legitimate networks.

Research Labs’ response to the SSHPsychos
threat, read the Cisco Security blog post

Browser Infections: Widespread—and a
Major Source of Data Leakage
Security teams often view browser add-ons as a lowseverity threat. However, they should make monitoring
them a higher priority so that they can quickly identify and
remediate these types of infections.
The reason for urgency: Our research indicates that
browser infections are much more prevalent than many
organizations may realize. From January to October 2015,
we examined 26 families of malicious browser add-ons
(Figure 9). Looking at the pattern of browser infections
during these
months, theEncryption

Cisco 2016 Annual Security Report

Malicious browser extensions can steal information, and
they can be a major source of data leakage. Every time a
user opens a new webpage with a compromised browser,
malicious browser extensions collect data. They are exfiltrating
more than the basic details about every internal or external
webpage that the user visits. They are also gathering highly
sensitive information embedded in the URL. This information
can include user credentials, customer data, and details about
an organization’s internal APIs and infrastructure.
Multipurpose malicious browser extensions are delivered
by software bundles or adware. They are designed to pull
in revenue by exploiting users in a number of ways. In an
infected browser, they can lead users to click on malvertising
such as display ads or pop-ups. They can also distribute
malware by enticing users to click a compromised link or
to download an infected file encountered in malvertising.
And they can hijack users’ browser requests and then inject
malicious webpages into search engine results pages.
Across the 45 companies in our sample, we determined
that in every month we observed more than 85 percent
of organizations were affected by malicious browser
extensions—a finding that underscores the massive scale
of these operations. Because infected browsers are
often considered a relatively minor threat, they can go
undetected or unresolved for days or even longer—giving
adversaries more time and opportunity to carry out their
campaigns (see “Time to Detection: The Race to Keep
Narrowing the Window,” page 60).
We therefore suggest that it is well worth security teams’
time to devote more resources to monitoring this risk, and to
consider increased use of automation to help prioritize threats.

Botnet Command and Control:
A Global Overview
Botnets are networks of malware-infected computers.
Adversaries can control them as a group and command
them to carry out a specific task, such as sending spam
or launching a DDoS attack. They have been growing in
both size and number for years. To better understand the
current threat landscape on a global scale, we analyzed the
networks of 121 companies from April to October 2015 for
evidence of one or more of eight commonly seen botnets.
The data was normalized to provide a general overview of
botnet activity (Figure 10).
We found that during this period, Gamarue—a modular,
multipurpose

has been around for

years—was
the
most
common
command-and-control
threat.

This pattern is deceptive, however. The increasing
volume of HTTPS traffic over those months made it
difficult to identify the indicators of compromise typically
associated with the 26 families we tracked, because URL
information was not visible due to encryption. (For more
on encryption, and the challenges it creates for defenders,
see “Encryption: A Growing Trend—and a Challenge for
Defenders,” page 30.)

A significant spike in the number of infections involving
the ransomware Cryptowall 3.0 was identified in July. This
activity is attributed largely to the Angler exploit kit, which
is known to drop the Cryptowall payload. As reported in the
Cisco 2015 Midyear Security Report, the authors of Angler
and other exploit kits have been quick to exploit “patching
gaps” with Adobe Flash—the time between Adobe’s release
of an update and when users actually upgrade.² Cisco
threat researchers attribute the July 2015 spike to the Flash
zero-day exploit CVE-2015-5119 that was exposed as
part of the Hacking Team leaks.³
The Angler exploit kit also delivers the Bedep Trojan, which
is used to perform click-fraud campaigns. A slight spike in
the prevalence of that threat was noted during July as
well (Figure 11).
Bedep, Gamarue, and Miuref (another Trojan and browser
hijacker that can perform click fraud) together represented

The percentage of Bedep infections remained relatively

decrease in Miuref infections was observed. We attribute
this to the increase in HTTPS traffic, which helped to
conceal Miuref’s indicators of compromise.
Figure 12 shows the types of botnets that were responsible
for the most infections during the time frame we monitored.
Multipurpose botnets like Gamarue and Sality led the pack,
followed by click-fraud botnets. Banking Trojans were third,
showing that this type of threat, while old, is still widespread.

The DNS Blind Spot: Attacks Using DNS for Command and Control
Cisco’s analysis of malware validated as “known bad”
found that the majority of that malware—91.3 percent—use
the Domain Name Service in one of these three ways:
•• To gain command and control
•• To exfiltrate data
•• To redirect traffic
To arrive at this percentage, we mined all sample behaviors
from a variety of sandboxes that we own. Malware that was
determined not to use DNS in any way, or that simply used
DNS to conduct Internet “health checks,” was removed
from the sample for analysis. The remaining malware was
using DNS to connect to sites that were validated as bad or
were considered suspicious.
Despite adversaries’ reliance on DNS to help further malware
campaigns, few companies are monitoring DNS for security
purposes (or monitoring DNS at all). This lack of oversight
makes DNS an ideal avenue for attackers. According to a
recent survey we conducted (see Figure 13), 68 percent of
security professionals report that their organizations do
not monitor threats from recursive DNS. (Recursive DNS
nameservers provide the IP addresses of intended domain
names to the requesting hosts.)

Why is DNS a security blind spot for so many organizations?
A primary reason is that security teams and DNS experts
typically work in different IT groups within a company and
don’t interact frequently.
But they should. Monitoring DNS is essential for identifying
and containing malware infections that are already using
DNS for one of the three activities listed earlier. It is also
an important first step in mapping out other components
that can be used for further investigating an attack, from
determining the type of infrastructure supporting the attack
to finding its source.
Monitoring DNS takes more than collaboration between
security and DNS teams, however. It requires the alignment
of the right technology and expertise for correlation
analysis. (For more insight, see “Industry Collaboration
Helps Cisco Sideline Far-Reaching and Highly Profitable
Exploit Kit and Ransomware Campaign” on page 10, to
find out how OpenDNS helped Cisco gain more domain
visibility into the IPs that the Angler exploit kit was using.)
RETROSPECTIVE DNS ANALYSIS
Cisco’s retrospective investigation into DNS queries and
subsequent TCP and UDP traffic identifies a number of
malware sources. These include command-and-control
servers, websites, and distribution points. Retrospective
investigation also detects high-threat content using
intelligence from threat lists, community threat reports,
observed trends in cyber compromises, and knowledge of
the unique vulnerabilities facing a customer’s industry.
Our retrospective reporting helps to identify “low-and-slow”
data exfiltration attempts commonly associated with advanced
persistent threat (APT) behavior and which, in many cases, is
not captured by traditional threat detection technologies.
The objective of the analysis is to identify anomalies within
the vast quantity of outgoing communications traffic.
This “inside out” approach can uncover possible data
compromises and damaging network activity that might
otherwise be overlooked.

Cisco 2016 Annual Security Report

This is how we have uncovered “rogue” DNS resolvers in
use on customer networks. The customers were not aware
that the resolvers were being used by their employees as
part of their DNS infrastructure. Failing to actively manage
and monitor the use of DNS resolvers can result in malicious
behavior such as DNS cache poisoning and DNS redirection.
Besides discovering and identifying rogue DNS resolvers,
retrospective investigation has also uncovered the following
issues in customer networks:
•• Customer address space found on third-party spam
and malware blocklists
•• Customer address space beaconing for known Zeus
and Palevo command-and-control servers
•• Active malware campaigns, including CTB-Locker,
Angler, and DarkHotel
•• Suspicious activity, including the use of Tor, email
auto-forwarding, and online document conversion

ADOBE FLASH: ON THE WAY OUT—EVENTUALLY
Despite the fact that overall Flash volume has decreased

developers. In fact, there was no discernible trend in
Flash malware either increasing or decreasing in 2015
(Figure 14). Flash-related malware is likely to remain a

Source: Cisco Security Research

Industry pressure to remove Adobe Flash from the browsing
experience is leading to a decrease in the amount of Flash
content on the web (see next section, “Adobe Flash and
PDF Content Trends”). This is similar to what has been
seen with Java content in recent years, and which has, in
turn, led to a steady downward trend in the volume of Java
malware (In fact, Angler’s authors don’t even bother to
include Java exploits anymore). Meanwhile, the volume of
PDF malware has remained fairly steady.
Microsoft Silverlight also has diminished as an attack vector
because many vendors have discontinued supporting
the API that Silverlight uses to integrate into browsers.
Many companies are moving away from Silverlight as
they embrace HTML5-based technologies. Microsoft has
indicated that there is no new version of Silverlight on the
horizon and is currently only issuing security-related updates.

ADOBE FLASH AND PDF CONTENT TRENDS
Cisco researchers have been watching a general decline in
the amount of Adobe Flash content on the web (Figure 15).
Recent actions by Amazon, Google, and other large players
in the Internet space are a factor for the decrease in Flash
content. These companies either no longer accept web
advertising that uses Flash, or they block it.
PDF content, meanwhile, has remained fairly stable over
the past year and is likely to remain so. However, it has not
been a major web attack vector for some time.
The decline in Flash content is likely to continue—and
perhaps, even accelerate—in the near term now that Adobe
has announced that it will be phasing out Flash.⁵ But it will
likely be some time before Flash content fades. Flash is
embedded in browsers such as Google Chrome, Microsoft
Internet Explorer, and Microsoft Edge and is still widely
used in web content, including gaming and video content.
However, in the years ahead, as new technologies are
adopted (such as HTML5 and mobile platforms), the
longer-term trend for web attack vectors like Java, Flash,
and Silverlight is becoming increasingly clear. Over time,
they will become less prevalent. Therefore, they are likely
to become much less attractive vectors to profit-minded
adversaries who focus on vectors that allow them to easily

Figure 16 can essentially be viewed as a collection of
types of malware that criminals use to gain initial access.
These are the tried-and-true and most cost-effective
methods of compromising large populations of users with
relative ease. JavaScript exploits and Facebook scams
(social engineering) were the most frequently used attack
methods, according to our research.
Figure 17 shows lower-volume malware. Note that “lower
volume” does not mean “less effective.” According to Cisco
Security Research, lower-volume malware can represent
emerging threats or highly targeted campaigns.
Many of these more sophisticated techniques are designed
to extract as much value as possible from compromised
users. They steal high-value data, or hold users’ digital
assets for ransom.
Therefore, when monitoring web malware, it is not enough
to simply focus on the types of threats most commonly
seen. The full spectrum of attacks must be considered.

ADOBE FLASH TOPS VULNERABILITIES LIST
The Adobe Flash platform has been a popular threat vector
for criminals for several years. Flash vulnerabilities still
turn up frequently on lists of high-urgency alerts. In 2015,
the good news was that the vendors of products in which
these exploits commonly occur, such as web browsers,
recognized this weakness and are now taking steps to
reduce opportunities for adversaries.
In 2016, criminals are most likely to focus their exploits
and attacks on Adobe Flash users. Some of these Flash
vulnerabilities have exploits available online either publicly
or for sale as part of exploit kits. (As noted on page 21, the
volume of Flash-related content has declined, but Flash
Figure X. Total Number of CVEs by Vendor
remains a primary exploitation vector.)

Threat Intelligence

Following up on tactics used to lessen the impact of Java—
another common threat vector—many web browsers block
or sandbox Flash as a way to protect users. Although this
is a positive development, it’s important to remember that
attackers will still succeed in launching exploits for some
time to come. Users may fail to update their browsers
as needed, and criminals will continue to launch exploits
aimed at older versions of browser software.
However, Cisco researchers believe that the protections
now built into some commonly used web browsers and
operating systems will lessen criminals’ reliance on Flash.
Because online attackers focus on achieving the best
possible results (such as high profitability) for the most
efficiency, they will put little effort into attacks that are less
likely to provide a return on investment.

Vertical Risk of Malware Encounters

Figure 21 shows the top 28 industries and their relative
block activity as a proportion of normal network traffic.
A ratio of 1.0 means the number of blocks is proportional
to the volume of observed traffic. Anything above 1.0
represents higher-than-expected block rates, and anything
below 1.0 represents lower-than-expected block rates.

To track high-risk verticals for web malware encounters,
we examined the relative volumes of attack traffic (“block
rates”) and “normal” or expected traffic.

Figure 22 illustrates how adversaries’ focus on specific
verticals can be fleeting. (Zero represents no net change.)
From January to March 2015, government was the vertical
with the highest block rate activity. From March to May, it
was electronics. In midsummer, professional services saw
the most blocks. And in the fall of 2015, healthcare was
leading all verticals in the number of block rates.

According to our research, the four verticals with the most
block activity in 2015 were all targeted with Trojan-related
attacks. The government vertical also faced a high number
of PHP injection attacks, while the professional services
vertical was hit with a high number of iFrame attacks.

Web Block Activity: Geographic Overview
We also examined where malware-based block activity
originates by country or region, as seen in Figure 23. The
countries were selected for the study based on their volume
of Internet traffic. A “block ratio” value of 1.0 indicates that
the number of blocks we see is proportional to network size.

Countries and regions with block activity that we consider
higher than normal probably have many web servers and
hosts with unpatched vulnerabilities on their networks.
Malicious actors do not respect country boundaries and
will host malware where it is most effective.

A presence in large, commercially viable networks that
handle high Internet volume is another factor for high block
activity—which is one reason why Hong Kong tops our list.
Figure 24, which shows a month-to-month comparison of web
blocks by country or region from November 2014 to October
2015, provides some additional context for these rankings.

Note that Hong Kong saw higher than normal web block
activity beginning in the spring of 2015, as did France.
Both have since experienced a significant drop in web
block activity, but because the higher rates of activity earlier
this year were so far above the baseline, the recent decline
in activity still leaves Hong Kong quite higher by the end
of the year than at the start. The spike in block activity in
France returned to normal levels by midsummer.

Cisco provides research and analysis on security trends and practices.
Paradoxically, some may make defenders’ ability to track threats more
challenging and place organizations and individual users at greater risk
for compromise or attack.
Encryption: A Growing Trend—and a Challenge for Defenders
Encryption makes sense. Companies need to protect their
intellectual property and other sensitive data, advertisers
want to preserve the integrity of their ad content and backend analytics, and businesses are placing more focus on
protecting their customers’ privacy.
But encryption also creates security issues for organizations—
including a false sense of security. Organizations have
become better at encrypting data when it is transmitted
between entities, but data at rest is often left unsecured.
Many of the most notable breaches in the last few years
have taken advantage of unencrypted data stored in the data
center and other internal systems. For attackers, this is like
following a secured supply truck to an unlocked warehouse.
It is also important for organizations to understand that
end-to-end encryption can lessen the effectiveness of
some security products. Encryption conceals the indicators
of compromise used to identify and track malicious activity.
But there is no excuse to leave sensitive data unencrypted.
Security tools and their operators need to adapt to this brave
new world by gathering headers and other non-encrypted
parts of the data stream along with other sources of
contextual information to analyze encrypted traffic. Tools
that rely on payload visibility, such as full packet capture,
are becoming less effective. Running Cisco NetFlow and
other metadata-based analyses is now essential.

Observing the trends of 2015, our researchers suggest that
encrypted traffic, particularly HTTPS, has reached a tipping
point. While not yet the majority of transactions, it will soon
become the dominant form of traffic on the Internet. In fact,
our research shows that it already consistently represents
over 50 percent of bytes transferred (Figure 25) due to the
HTTPS overhead and larger content that is sent via HTTPS,
such as transfers to file storage sites.

For any web transaction, a number of bytes is sent out
(outbound) and received (inbound). HTTPS transactions
have larger outbound requests than HTTP outbound
requests—about an extra 2000 bytes. HTTPS inbound
requests, meanwhile, also have overhead, but this becomes
less significant with larger responses.

Figure X. HTTPS Request- Biggest Changes
from January to September 2015

By combining the incoming and outgoing bytes per web
transaction, we can determine the overall percentage of all
bytes involved per web transaction that are encrypted using
HTTPS. Due to the increase in HTTPS traffic and the extra
overhead, we determined that HTTPS bytes represented
57 percent of all web traffic in October 2015 (Figure 25),
up from 46 percent in January.
We also determined through web traffic analysis that
HTTPS requests have been increasing gradually, but
significantly, since January 2015. As Figure 25 shows,
24 percent of the requests in January used the HTTPS
protocol; the rest of them used HTTP.

Ultimately, there is increasing encrypted activity occurring in
both the number of encrypted transactions and the number
of encrypted bytes in each transaction. Each one poses its
own benefit and its own potential risk, ushering in the need
for an integrated threat defense that helps increase visibility.

Looking at the top domains by requests (Figure 27), we
see that many of the main content pages of Google and
Facebook are encrypted. Typically, only 10 percent of their
advertising traffic is encrypted.
Regardless of the challenges, data encryption is a requirement
in the current threat landscape. Attackers are too adept
at circumventing access control for users to leave critical
information unprotected at any stage of storage or transfer.
This is why it is essential for security teams to monitor
web traffic patterns to make sure that HTTPS requests
are not coming from, or going to, suspicious locations.
A word of caution: Don’t look for encrypted traffic over a
predefined set of ports. As discussed in the next section, our
research shows that malware is likely to initiate encrypted
communications over a diverse set of ports.
THE ENTROPY FACTOR
High entropy is a good indication of encrypted or compressed
file transfers or communication.⁶ The good news for
security teams is that entropy is relatively easy to monitor
because it does not require knowledge of the underlying
cryptographic protocols.

During a 3-month period beginning June 1, 2015, Cisco
security researchers observed 7,480,178 flows from
598,138 “threat score: 100” malware samples submitted.
There were 958,851 high-entropy flows during this period,
or 12.82 percent.
We also identified 917,052 flows over the Transport
Layer Security (TLS) protocol (12.26 percent). In addition,
8419 TLS flows were over a port other than 443—the
default port for secured HTTP. Some of the ports that the
observed malware used for communication were ports 21,
53, 80, and 500.
As the level of encrypted Internet traffic continues to rise,
it will become increasingly important for organizations to
embrace an integrated threat defense architecture (see
“The Six Tenets of Integrated Threat Defense,” page 62).
Point solutions are not effective at identifying potential
threats in encrypted traffic. Integrated security platforms
provide security teams with more visibility into what’s
happening on devices or networks, so they can more easily
identify suspicious patterns of activity.

⁶ Entropy: In computing, entropy (lack of order or predictability) is the randomness collected by an operating system or application for use in
cryptography or other uses that require random data.

The Move Toward Encryption: Case Data
Lancope, a Cisco company, examined encryption
rates for both internal and Internet traffic across three
business sectors (two universities, a hospital, and an
ISP provider, all based in the United States).
At one of the universities, Lancope found that almost all
internal traffic was encrypted (82 percent). In addition,
53 percent of the university’s Internet traffic was
encrypted. These findings are on par with trends that
Lancope has observed in other industries.

The study by Lancope tells a story of broad-based
adoption of encryption for data in motion across various

Online Criminals Increase Server Activity on WordPress
As discussed in the introduction to this report, online criminals
are continually on the lookout for methods to add efficiency
and cost savings to their operations—along with new ways to
evade detection. Increasingly, cybercriminals are finding
this efficiency within websites created using WordPress,
the popular website and blog development platform. In
WordPress sites, attackers can take control of a steady
stream of compromised servers to create an infrastructure
that supports ransomware, bank fraud, or phishing attacks.
The Internet is filled with abandoned sites created
with WordPress that are not maintained from a security
perspective; as new security issues surface, these sites are
often compromised and incorporated into attack campaigns.
Analyzing the systems used to support ransomware and
other malware, Cisco security researchers found that many
online criminals are shifting online activity to compromised
WordPress servers. The number of WordPress domains
used by criminals grew 221 percent between February and
October 2015 (see Figure 28).
This shift in venue, Cisco researchers believe, has
happened for a couple of reasons. When ransomware
uses other tools to communicate encryption keys or other

command-and-control information, those communications
can be detected or blocked, which prevents the encryption
process from completing. However, communications that
relay encryption keys through compromised WordPress
servers may appear normal, thus increasing the chances
that
file encryption
will beDomains
completed.
In other words, the

To sidestep the drawbacks of other technologies, criminals
have turned to WordPress, which they use to host malware
payloads and command-and-control servers. WordPress
sites offer several advantages. For example, the many
abandoned sites give criminals more opportunities for
compromising sites with weak security protections.

These vulnerabilities allowed attackers to co-opt WordPress
servers and use them as malware infrastructure (see Figure 29).

The risk of using compromised systems to run a malware
operation is that one of the hacked servers may be taken
down when the compromise is discovered. If this happens
in the middle of a campaign, the malware downloader may
fail to retrieve its payload or the malware may be unable
to communicate with its command-and-control servers.
Cisco security researchers noticed that malware overcame
this by using more than one WordPress server; Cisco even
discovered lists of compromised WordPress servers stored
on data-sharing sites such as Pastebin.

•• Configuration files for malware such as Dridex and Dyre

The malware used these lists to find working commandand-control servers, allowing the malware to operate even
if a compromised server failed. Researchers also identified
malware downloaders that contained a list of WordPress
sites storing payloads. If one download site was not working,
the malware went to the next one and downloaded malicious
payloads from the working WordPress server.

Cisco researchers have identified some of the software and
file types commonly hosted on compromised WordPress sites:
•• Executable files that are payloads for exploit kit attacks
•• Proxy code that relays command-and-control communication to hide command-and-control infrastructure
•• Phishing webpages for collecting usernames
and passwords
•• HTML scripts that redirect traffic to exploit kit servers
In addition, Cisco researchers have identified many
malware families that are using compromised WordPress
sites for infrastructure:
•• Dridex infostealer
•• Pony password stealer
•• TeslaCrypt ransomware
•• Cryptowall 3.0 ransomware
•• TorrentLocker ransomware

The compromised WordPress sites were often not running
the latest version of WordPress, had weak admin passwords,
and used plugins that were missing security patches.

•• Andromeda spam botnet
•• Bartallex Trojan dropper
•• Necurs infostealer
•• Fake login pages

Aging Infrastructure: A Problem
10 Years in the Making

6

We recently analyzed 115,000 Cisco devices on the Internet
and across customer environments as a way to bring
attention to the security risks that aging infrastructure—
and lack of attention to patching vulnerabilities—present.
We identified the 115,000 devices in our one-day sample
by scanning the Internet and then looking at the devices
from the “outside in” (from the Internet view and into
the enterprise). Through our scanning and analysis, we
found that 106,000 of the 115,000 devices had known
vulnerabilities in the software they were running. That
means 92 percent of the Cisco devices on the Internet in
our sample are susceptible to known vulnerabilities.
Cisco also discovered that the version of the software
that those devices were running had 26 vulnerabilities, on
average. In addition, we learned that many organizations

All companies today are IT companies to some degree,
because they are dependent on their IT and OT (operational
technology) infrastructure to be connected, digitized, and
successful. That means they need to make IT security a
priority. Yet many organizations rely on network infrastructures
built of components that are old, outdated, and running
vulnerable operating systems—and are not cyber-resilient.

We also discovered that many of the infrastructure devices
we analyzed had reached their last day of support (LDoS)—
meaning they cannot be updated and made more secure
(Figure 31). These devices are not even receiving patches
for known vulnerabilities, so they are not being provided
information
about new threats.

In addition, 8 percent of the 115,000 devices in our sample
that we analyzed have reached their end-of-life stage, and
another 31 percent will reach end of support within one to
four years.
Aging, outdated IT infrastructure is a vulnerability for
organizations. As we move closer to the Internet of Things
(IoT)—and the Internet of Everything (IoE)—it becomes more
important for businesses to make sure they are relying on
a network infrastructure that is secure, thus ensuring the
integrity of the data and communications traversing the
network. This is critical to the success of the emerging IoE.

Industry Insights

Many Cisco customers built their network infrastructure a
decade ago. Back then, many businesses simply did not
account for the fact that they would be 100 percent reliant
on that infrastructure. Nor did they anticipate that their
infrastructure would become a prime target for adversaries.
Organizations tend to avoid making infrastructure updates
because it’s expensive and requires network downtime.
In some cases, a simple update won’t be enough. Some
products are so old they cannot be upgraded to incorporate
the latest security solutions needed to protect the business.
These facts alone speak to the criticality of maintaining
infrastructure. Organizations need to plan for regular
upgrades and recognize the value of taking control of their
critical infrastructure proactively—before an adversary does.

Cumulative Alert Totals Show Growing Commitment to Managing Vulnerabilities
Reliance on aging infrastructure opens the door to
attackers. However, the rise in cumulative alerts—
which include product vulnerabilities in open-source
and proprietary solutions—is a positive sign that
the technology industry is paying close attention to
eliminating opportunities for attackers.

21% from 2014 to 2015

Cumulative alert totals have increased 21 percent from
2014 to 2015. From July through September 2015,
the increase was notably high. This increase can be
attributed in large part to major software updates from
vendors such as Microsoft and Apple, because product
updates lead to more reporting of software vulnerabilities.
Major software vendors now release patches and
upgrades in greater volume, and they are more
transparent about this activity. The increasing volume
is a main driver for organizations automating their
vulnerability management through the use of security
intelligence and management platforms that help
manage the volume of system and software inventory,
vulnerability, and threat information. Using these systems
and application programming interfaces (APIs) allows for
more efficient, timely, and effective security management
across large and small organizations.

Threat Categories: Decline in Buffer Errors, Information Leaks, and Disclosures
In examining common vulnerability categories, cross-site
scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities dropped 47 percent from
2014 to 2015 (Figure 33). The decrease may be a result
of the greater attention paid to vulnerability testing.
Vendors have become more skilled at identifying these
particular vulnerabilities and fixing them before their
products go to market.

Information leak or information disclosure vulnerabilities
dropped 15 percent in 2015. These vulnerabilities
involve unintentional disclosures to parties that don’t
have explicit access. Vendors have become attentive to
controls that allow or disallow access to data, making
this common vulnerability a less-frequent occurrence.

Are Small and Midsize Businesses a Weak Link to Enterprise Security?
SMBs play a critical role in national economies. When
entrusted with data by their customers, SMBs also carry
the responsibility of protecting this information from online
attackers. However, as detailed in the Cisco 2015 Security
Capabilities Benchmark Study (see page 41), SMBs show
signs that their defenses against attackers are weaker than
their challenges demand. In turn, these weaknesses can
place SMBs’ enterprise customers at risk. Attackers that
can breach an SMB network could also find a path into an
enterprise network.

Judging from the results of the Cisco 2014 Security Capabilities Benchmark Study, SMBs are using fewer processes
to analyze compromises and fewer threat defense tools
than they used last year. For example, 48 percent of SMBs
said in 2015 that they used web security; 59 percent said they
did in 2014. Only 29 percent said they used patching and configuration tools in 2015, compared with 39 percent in 2014.
In addition, of the SMB respondents that do not have an
executive responsible for security, nearly one-quarter do
not believe their businesses are high-value targets for online
criminals. This belief hints at overconfidence in their business’s
ability to thwart today’s sophisticated online attacks—or, more
likely, that attacks will never happen to their business.

SMBS LESS LIKELY TO USE INCIDENT RESPONSE TEAMS
In many cases, SMBs are less likely than large enterprises

This may be due to budget constraints: Respondents
pointed to budget issues as one of the biggest obstacles
to adopting advanced security processes and technology.
Seventy-two percent of large enterprises (those with more
than 1000 employees) have both teams, compared with
67 percent of businesses with fewer than 500 employees.

Why is it significant that SMBs tend to use fewer defenses
than their larger counterparts? In a security environment
where attackers are developing more sophisticated
tactics for entering networks and remaining undetected, no
business can afford to leave its networks unprotected, or to
put off using processes that might offer insights on how a
compromise occurred so it can be avoided in the future.
In addition, SMBs may not realize that their own vulnerability
translates to risks for larger enterprise customers and
their networks. Today’s criminals often gain entry into one
network as a means to find an entry point into another,
more lucrative network—and the SMB may be the starting
point for such an attack.

SMBs’ view of their businesses as targets of cybercriminals
may demonstrate a gap in their perception of the threat
landscape. As illustrated above in Figure 38, 22 percent of
businesses with fewer than 500 employees said they do not
have an executive with direct responsibility and accountability
for security because they do not view themselves as
high-value targets.

Industry Insights

SMBs MORE LIKELY TO OUTSOURCE SECURITY FUNCTIONS IN 2015
Although the survey shows that more SMBs overall are
outsourcing some of their security functions, SMBs are
generally less likely than large enterprises to outsource
certain services, such as advice and consulting. For
example, 55 percent of large enterprises outsource advice
and consulting services, compared with 46 percent of
businesses with fewer than 500 employees. Fifty-six percent
of large enterprises outsource security auditing tasks,
compared with 42 percent of businesses with fewer than
500 employees (see Figure 39).

The fact that more SMBs are adopting outsourcing as a
way to manage security is good news. It says that SMBs
are seeking flexible tools for securing networks that
do not place a burden on their smaller staffs or more
conservative budgets. However, SMBs may mistakenly
believe that outsourcing security processes will greatly
reduce the likelihood of a network breach. Or they may
place the onus for security on a third party. Such a
viewpoint would be wishful thinking, since only a truly
integrated threat defense system—one that examines and
mitigates attacks as well as prevents them—can provide
enterprise-level security protection.

However, in 2015, more SMBs are outsourcing at least
some security services. In 2014, 24 percent of SMBs with
less than 499 employees said they did not outsource any
services. In 2015, only 18 percent of SMBs said the same.

Cisco Security Capabilities
Benchmark Study
To gauge the perceptions of security professionals on the state of
security in their organizations, Cisco asked chief security officers
(CSOs) and security operations (SecOps) managers in several
countries and at organizations of various sizes about their perceptions
of their security resources and procedures. The Cisco 2015 Security
Capabilities Benchmark Study offers insights on the maturity level of
security operations and security practices currently in use, and also
compares these results with those of the inaugural 2014 study.
Decline in Confidence Amid Signs of Preparedness
In the face of more sophisticated threats, the Cisco study
suggests that the confidence of security professionals
appears to be flagging. On the other hand, deepening
concerns about security are changing how these
professionals protect networks. For example, we are
seeing more security training, an increase in formal written
policies, and more outsourcing of tasks such as security
audits, consulting, and incident response. In short, security
professionals show signs that they are taking action to
combat the threats that loom over their networks.

The moves toward training and outsourcing are positive
developments, but the security industry can’t stop there.
It must continue to increase its use of tools and processes
to improve the detection, containment, and remediation of
threats. Given the barriers of budget limitations and solution
compatibility, the industry must also explore effective
solutions that provide an integrated threat defense. The
industry must also do a better job of collaborating with
other organizations when public breaches occur (such
as with the SSHPsychos botnet; see page 14), since
knowledge-sharing can help prevent future attacks.

RESOURCES: ORGANIZATIONS MORE LIKELY TO OUTSOURCE
As security professionals become aware of threats,
they may be seeking ways to improve their defenses—
for example, by outsourcing security tasks that can be
managed more efficiently by consultants or vendors. In
2015, 47 percent of our surveyed companies outsourced
security audits, an increase from 41 percent in 2014.

In addition, more security professionals are outsourcing
at least some security functions. In 2014, 21 percent
of the survey respondents said they did not outsource
any security services. In 2015, that number dropped
significantly, to 12 percent. Fifty-three percent said they
outsource services because doing so was more costefficient, while 49 percent said they outsource services
to obtain unbiased insights.
To add protection to their networks and data, security
professionals indicated that they are receptive to the
concept of hosting networks off-premises. While onpremises hosting is still the favored option, the number of
professionals using off-premises solutions has increased.
In 2015, 20 percent used off-premises private cloud
solutions compared with 18 percent in 2014 (Figure 41).

The security teams surveyed by Cisco are more intent on
protecting their networks more effectively, but they may
be limited in their ability to carry out their plans. Security
professionals said that budget constraints (39 percent) top
the list of likely reasons to choose or reject security services
and tools, followed by technology compatibility issues
(32 percent; see Figure 42). Budget constraints become
more of a problem for enterprises that rank in the low and
lower-mid maturity levels (see Figure 43). In the responses
from all security professionals, 39 percent cite budget
constraints as an obstacle to adopting advanced security
processes. That figure is 43 percent of enterprises in

One sign that some organizations are giving more thought to
their security resources is how they structure their security
budget. The survey shows a slight increase in the number of
organizations that separate the security budget from overall
IT budget. In 2014, 6 percent of professionals said they had
completely separated security and IT budgets; in 2015, that

CAPABILITIES: CONFIDENCE IS DOWN
In 2015, security professionals were less confident that
their security infrastructure is up to date than they were
in 2014. This decline in confidence is due, no doubt, to
the steady drumbeat of high-profile attacks on major
enterprises, the corresponding theft of private data, and
the public apologies from companies whose networks
have been breached.

As a sign that confidence is on the decline, security professionals show slightly less confidence in their technologies. In
2014, 64 percent said their security infrastructure was up to
date and constantly upgraded. In 2015, that number dropped
to 59 percent (Figure 48). Also, in 2014, 33 percent said their
organizations were not equipped with the latest security tools;
that number rose to 37 percent in 2015.

Confidence is somewhat higher among CSOs, who are more
optimistic than security operations managers: 65 percent
of CSOs believe their security infrastructure is up to date,
compared with 54 percent of SecOps managers. The
confidence of SecOps managers is likely to suffer because
they respond to day-to-day security incidents, giving them
a less positive view of their security readiness.

Security professionals also show mixed levels of confidence
in terms of their ability to thwart attackers. Fifty-one percent
strongly believe they can detect security weaknesses before
they become full-blown incidents; only 45 percent are
confident in their ability to determine the scope of a network
compromise, and to remediate the damage (see Figure 49).

Security professionals also show weaker confidence levels in
their capability to defend their networks against attacks. For
example, in 2015, fewer professionals strongly believe that
they do a good job of building security into procedures for
acquiring, developing, and maintaining systems (54 percent
in 2015, compared with 58 percent in 2014; see Figure 50).

Similar to the respondents in 2014, more than one-fourth of the security professionals in 2015 said they perceive their security
tools to be only somewhat effective (Figure 53).

Cisco 2016 Annual Security Report

Public security breaches tend to be a defining moment
for organizations. Once they occur, organizations seem
to become more aware of the need to prevent future
breaches. However, in 2015, fewer security professionals
said their organizations had to deal with public security
breaches: they made up 53 percent of the professionals
in 2014, and 48 percent in 2015 (Figure 54).
Professionals acknowledge the value that breaches have in
terms of delivering a wake-up call about the importance of
strengthening security processes: 47 percent of the security
professionals affected by public breaches said the breaches
resulted in better policies and procedures. For example,
43 percent of the respondents said they increased security
training after a public breach, and 42 percent said they
increased investments in security defense technologies.
The good news is that organizations that have suffered
a public breach are increasingly likely to strengthen
their security processes. In 2015, 97 percent of security
professionals said they conduct security training at least
once a year, a solid increase from 82 percent in 2014
(see Figure 90 on page 82).

Based on Security Processes

As organizations deploy more sophisticated security practices
and policies, their perceptions of their security readiness
may shift. The Cisco 2015 Security Capabilities Benchmark
Study places survey respondents and their organizations
into five maturity categories, based on responses about
their security processes (Figure 56). The study examines
how different characteristics such as capabilities, industries,
and countries may affect maturity levels.

Cisco explored several options for sample segmentation before
selecting a five-segment solution based on a series of questions
targeting security processes. The five-segment solution maps
fairly closely to the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI).
5–Segment–Based Solution

Interestingly, organizations at different maturity levels
seem to share some of the obstacles to implementing
more sophisticated security processes and tools. Although
the exact percentages may vary, the challenge of budget
constraints ranks at the top of the list at every level of
maturity (Figure 57).

RECOMMENDATIONS: RESPONDING TO
THE REALITY CHECK
As our Security Benchmark Capabilities Study shows,
reality has set in for security professionals. Security
professionals’ confidence in their readiness to block
attackers is wavering. However, the reality checks provided
by high-profile exploits have had a positive effect on the
industry, judging from the uptick in security training and
formal policy development. In addition, the more frequent
outsourcing of audits and incident response services
indicates that defenders are searching for expert help.
Enterprises should continue to raise their awareness of
their security preparedness, and security professionals
must champion the growth of budgetary outlays to support
technology and personnel. In addition, confidence will rise
when security practitioners deploy tools that can not only
detect threats, but also contain their impact and boost
understanding of ways to prevent future attacks.

Cisco geopolitical experts offer insight on the changing landscape for
Internet governance, including changes in data transfer legislation and
the debate over the use of encryption. Also featured in this section
are select findings from two Cisco studies. One examines executives’
concerns about cybersecurity. The other focuses on IT decisionmakers’ perceptions about security risk and trustworthiness. We
also give an overview of the value of an integrated threat defense
architecture and provide an update on Cisco’s progress in reducing
time to detection (TTD).
Geopolitical Perspective: Uncertainty in the Internet Governance Landscape
In the post–Edward Snowden era, the geopolitical landscape
for Internet governance has changed dramatically. There
is now pervasive uncertainty surrounding the free flow of
information across borders. The landmark case brought
by the Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems against the
social networking giant Facebook had perhaps the biggest
impact, leading the Court of Justice of the European Union
(CJEU) to overturn the U.S. Safe Harbor agreement on
October 6, 2015.⁷
Consequently, companies are now forced to rely on
mechanisms and legal safeguards other than Safe Harbor
when transferring data out of the EU to the United States—
which are, in turn, subject to investigation. Data companies
are still trying to assess the fallout from this move. And
while EU and U.S. authorities have been working on a
replacement for Safe Harbor for the last two years, there
are concerns about the anticipated new mechanism. It
could either fail to materialize by the January 2016 deadline

or, perhaps more likely, fail to restore market confidence
if it does not fully address the concerns of the CJEU and
proves once more to be at risk of invalidation.⁸
Data protection experts expect Safe Harbor 2.0 to be no
less controversial than its predecessor. It may even follow
the same path by being challenged in court and also
declared invalid.⁹
End-to-end encryption—how it benefits consumers and
organizations, and the challenges it creates for law
enforcement in their investigations of criminal and terrorist
activity—will also be a topic of much debate between
governments and industry in the year ahead. The terrorist
attacks in Paris in November 2015 have some policymakers
pushing even harder to give investigators the ability to
access the content of encrypted communications.¹⁰ This
could give additional momentum to the development of
Safe Harbor 2.0, as civil liberties concerns take a backseat
to security concerns.

⁷ “The Court of Justice declares that the Commission’s U.S. Safe Harbour Decision is invalid,” CJEU, October 6, 2015:

Cisco 2016 Annual Security Report

A Look Forward

Amid such uncertainty, what should organizations ask
data providers in order to make sure that their business
is in compliance with data transfer regulations? In the
short term, they should certainly seek assurances from
vendors that they are using EU Model Contract Clauses or
Binding Corporate Rules—and not just Safe Harbor—when
transferring data out of the EU.
Another major geopolitical issue that organizations should
monitor relates to vulnerabilities and exploits. Some
governments are expressing great concern about the
rise of a market for unpatched vulnerabilities—so-called
weaponized software. Such tools are vital to the security
research community as it looks for ways to protect
networks around the globe. But in the wrong hands,
particularly those of repressive regimes, this technology,
intended for good, could be used for financial crime, to
steal national and commercial secrets, suppress political
dissent, or disrupt critical infrastructure.

Cybersecurity Concerns Weigh on
Minds of Executives
Obviously, in-depth security can help enterprises avoid
calamitous breaches and attacks. But can it help improve the
chances of a company’s success? According to an October
2015 Cisco study of finance and line-of-business executives
regarding cybersecurity’s role in business and digital strategy,
enterprise executives understand that protecting their
businesses from threats may dictate whether they succeed
or fail. As organizations become more digitized, growth will
depend on their ability to protect the digital platform.
As the survey shows, cybersecurity is a growing concern
for executives: 48 percent said they were very concerned,
and 39 percent said they were moderately concerned about
cybersecurity breaches. This concern is on the rise; 41 percent
said they were much more concerned about security
breaches than they were three years ago, and 42 percent
said they were a little more concerned than before.

How to restrict access to unpatched vulnerabilities without
Business leaders are also anticipating that investors
tying the hands of those conducting vital research is an issue
and regulators will ask tougher questions about security
that governments will clearly wrestle with in the coming
processes, just as they ask questions about other business
months and years. As governments attempt to tackle

Sixty-eight percent of the respondents to our study
identified malware as the top external security challenge
that their organization faces. Phishing and advanced
persistent threats rounded out the top three responses—
at 54 percent and 43 percent, respectively (see Figure 65).
As for internal security challenges (see Figure 66), more
than half (54 percent) of our respondents cited malicious
software downloads as the top threat, followed by internal
security breaches by employees (47 percent), and hardware
and software vulnerabilities (46 percent).
We also found that most enterprises (92 percent) employ
a dedicated security team within their organization.
Eighty-eight percent of respondents reported that they
have a formal, organization-wide security strategy that
is renewed regularly. However, only 59 percent have
standardized policies and procedures in place to validate
IT vendor trustworthiness (see Figure 67).
In addition, about half (49 percent) of large enterprise
organizations keep their security infrastructure up to date
with the most current technologies, and most others
upgrade their infrastructure regularly. Very few wait
to upgrade until the technology they use is obsolete,
according to our study.

How Vendors Can Demonstrate Trustworthiness
In today’s threat-centric landscape, confidence
in a vendor’s processes, policies, technologies,
and people—and the ability to verify them—are
foundational to building a lasting, trusted relationship
between vendors and enterprises.

Technology vendors demonstrate trustworthiness by:
•• Building security into their solutions and the value
chain from inception
•• Having and following policies and processes in
place that reduce risk
•• Creating a security-aware culture
•• Responding to breaches quickly and transparently
•• Providing rapid remediation and constant
vigilance after an incident

Upgrading infrastructure is good practice, of course.
Organizations of all sizes need to deploy a secure, trustworthy
infrastructure in which security is designed into all facets
of the network. However, they can also help to shrink the
attack surface by fostering an open, security-aware culture.

Time to Detection: The Race to Keep
Narrowing the Window
We define “time to detection,” or TTD, as the window of
time between the first observation of an unknown file and
the detection of a threat. We determine this time window
using opt-in security telemetry gathered from Cisco
security products deployed around the globe.

Building this culture requires that organizations implement
consistent, enterprise-wide policies and processes
that ensure security is embedded into every aspect

Cisco 2016 Annual Security Report

A Look Forward

From January to March, the median TTD was roughly the
same—between 44 and 46 hours, but with a slight trend
downward. In April, it had edged up slightly to 49 hours.
However, by the end of May, TTD for Cisco had decreased
to about 41 hours.

Since that time, the median TTD has been on a
rapid decline. By October, Cisco had reduced
the median TTD to about 17 hours—less than
one day. This far outpaces the current industry
estimate for TTD (100 to 200 days). The speed
is due to the inclusion of more detail about how
short-lived infections are mitigated.

The industrialization of hacking and the greater use of
commodity malware have played an important role in our
ability to narrow the window on TTD. As soon as a threat
becomes industrialized, it becomes more widespread and
thus easier to detect.
However, we also suggest that the combination of sophisti-

and significantly reduce the median

The TTD comparison in Figure 69 shows that many
threats in June were being caught within around 35.3
hours. By October, more threats were being stopped within
around 17.5 hours. Again, we attribute the reduction in
median TTD partly to a faster identification of commodity
malware, such as Cryptowall 3.0, Upatre, and Dyre. The
integration of new technologies, such as those from
ThreatGRID, a Cisco company, is another factor.
However, even with the narrowed time window for
TTD, some threats remain harder to detect than others.
Downloaders that target Microsoft Word users are
typically the easiest to detect (<20 hours). Adware and
browser injections are among the most difficult threats to
detect (<200 hours).
One reason the latter threats are so challenging to detect
is that they are typically designated as a lower priority by
security teams, and are therefore often overlooked in the
race to deflect adversaries’ onslaught of zero-day attacks
(see “Browser Infections: Widespread—and a Major Source
of Data Leakage” on page 16).
Figure 70 provides an overview of the types of threats that
usually come to light within 100 days.

The Six Tenets of Integrated
Threat Defense
In the Cisco 2015 Midyear Security Report, Cisco security
experts asserted that the need for adaptive, integrated
solutions will lead to major changes in the security
industry within the next five years. The outcomes will be
industry consolidation and a unified movement toward a
scalable, integrated threat defense architecture. Such an
architecture will provide visibility, control, intelligence, and
context across many solutions.
This “detection and response” framework will make
possible a faster response to both known and emerging
threats. At the core of this new architecture will be a
visibility platform that delivers full contextual awareness and
is continuously updated to assess threats, correlate local
and global intelligence, and optimize defenses. The intent
of this platform is to build a foundation that all vendors can
operate on and contribute to. With visibility, there is more
control, which leads to better protection across more threat
vectors and the ability to thwart more attacks.

A Look Forward

2. Best-in-class technology alone cannot deal with the
current—or future—threat landscape; it just adds to
the complexity of the networked environment.
Organizations invest in “best-in-class” security
technologies, but how do they know if those solutions
are really working? The headlines about major security
breaches over the past year are evidence that many
security technologies aren’t working well. And when
they fail, they fail badly.
A proliferation of security vendors offering best-inclass solutions doesn’t help to improve the security
environment unless those vendors offer radically
different—not just slightly different—solutions from
those of their competitors. But today, there are no stark
differences in many offerings from leading vendors in
most core areas of security.
3. More encrypted traffic will require an integrated
threat defense that can converge on encrypted
malicious activity that renders particular point
products ineffective.

Below, we present six tenets of integrated threat defense
to help organizations, and their security vendors, better
understand the intent and potential benefits of this architecture:

As discussed in this report, encrypted web traffic is on
the rise. There are good reasons for using encryption,
of course, but encryption also makes it challenging for
security teams to track threats.

1. A richer network and security architecture is needed
to address the growing volume and sophistication of
threat actors.

The answer to the encryption “problem” is to have more
visibility into what’s happening on devices or networks.
Integrated security platforms can help to provide this.

For the past 25 years, the traditional model for security
has been “See a problem, buy a box.” But these
solutions, often a collection of technologies from many
different security vendors, don’t talk to each other in any
meaningful way. They produce information and intelligence
about security events, which are integrated into an event
platform and then analyzed by security personnel.
An integrated threat defense architecture is a detection
and response framework that offers more capabilities
and supports faster threat responses by collecting
more information from deployed infrastructure in an
automated, efficient manner. The framework observes
the security environment more intelligently. Instead
of just alerting security teams to suspicious events
and policy violations, it can paint a clear picture of the
network and what’s happening on it to help inform
better decision-making around security.

4. Open APIs are crucial to an integrated threat
defense architecture.
Multivendor environments need a common platform that
provides greater visibility, context, and control. Building
a front-end integration platform can support better
automation and bring better awareness into the security
products themselves.
5. An integrated threat defense architecture requires
less gear and software to install and manage.
Security vendors should strive to offer platforms that
are as feature-rich as possible and that offer extensive
functionality on one platform. This will help to reduce
the complexity and fragmentation in the security
environment that create too many opportunities for
easy access and concealment for adversaries.

62

Cisco 2016 Annual Security Report

6. The automation and coordination aspects of an
integrated threat defense help to reduce time to
detection, containment, and remediation.
Reducing false positives helps security teams focus on
what matters most. Contextualization supports a frontline analysis of events underway, helps teams assess
whether those events require immediate attention,
and can ultimately produce automated responses
and deeper analytics.

Power in Numbers: The Value of
Industry Collaboration
Industry collaboration is essential not only to developing
a future architecture for integrated threat defense that
will enable faster threat response, but also for keeping
pace today with a global community of increasingly bold,
innovative, and persistent threat actors. Adversaries are
becoming only more adept at deploying hard-to-detect and
highly profitable campaigns. Many now employ legitimate
assets in the infrastructure to support their campaigns—and
with great success.

Given this landscape, it is not surprising that the defenders
surveyed for our Cisco 2015 Security Capabilities Benchmark
Study are less confident in their ability to help secure their
organization. We suggest that defenders consider the
powerful impact that proactive and continuous industry
collaboration can have in bringing cybercriminal activity to
light, undermining adversaries’ ability to generate revenue,
and reducing the opportunity to launch future attacks.
As discussed in depth earlier in this report (see “Featured
Stories,” starting on page 10), collaboration between a Cisco
Partner Contributor and within our Cisco Collective Security
Intelligence (CSI) ecosystem, and cooperation with service
providers, were significant factors in Cisco’s ability to
uncover, verify, and sideline global operations involving the
Angler exploit kit, and to weaken one of the largest DDoS
botnets our researchers have ever observed, SSHPsychos.

About Cisco

About Cisco

Cisco delivers intelligent cybersecurity for the real world, providing
one of the industry’s most comprehensive advanced-threat protection
portfolios of solutions across the broadest set of attack vectors.
Cisco’s threat-centric and operationalized approach to security
reduces complexity and fragmentation while providing superior
visibility, consistent control, and advanced threat protection before,
during, and after an attack.

Threat researchers from the Cisco Collective Security
Intelligence (CSI) ecosystem bring together, under a single
umbrella, the industry’s leading threat intelligence, using
telemetry obtained from the vast footprint of devices and
sensors, public and private feeds, and the open-source
community at Cisco. This amounts to a daily ingest of
billions of web requests and millions of emails, malware
samples, and network intrusions.
Our sophisticated infrastructure and systems consume
this telemetry, helping machine-learning systems and
researchers to track threats across networks, data centers,
endpoints, mobile devices, virtual systems, web, email, and
from the cloud to identify root causes and scope outbreaks.
The resulting intelligence is translated into real-time
protections for our products and services offerings that
are immediately delivered globally to Cisco customers.

security, visit www.cisco.com/go/security.

Security Risk and Trustworthiness Study
Research Background and Objectives

Figure 93. Background and Methodology
Cisco is interested in obtaining a deeper understanding of Enterprise and Service Provider IT decision makers’ perceptions of their
organization’s security risks and challenges and the role that IT vendor trustworthiness plays in IT solution purchases.
Specific objectives include:

Gauge the level of risk
from external and
internal threats and
vulnerabilities

Understand the
strategies, policies,
and solutions being
implemented to
mitigate security risks

Identify the purchase
process for IT
solutions and the role
of IT vendor trustworthiness in that process

Gauge interest in
receiving communications about how to
validate IT vendor
trustworthiness

Determine if there are
differences in security
risk perspectives or
approaches to
mitigating risks across
industries and
audiences

Methodology: Quantitative and Qualitative Approach

Two methodologies were utilized to provide insight into each of these research objectives:
(All respondents involved in IT purchase decision=making)
Quantitative web-based survey among

Qualitative in-depth interviews among

1050 enterprise ITDMs

20 service providers

(402 US, 282 UK, 197 Germany, 169 France)

(7 US., 3 Canada, 3 U.K., 4 Germany, 3 France)

Research was conducted in the U.S., U.K., France,
Germany, and Canada (IDIs only)
