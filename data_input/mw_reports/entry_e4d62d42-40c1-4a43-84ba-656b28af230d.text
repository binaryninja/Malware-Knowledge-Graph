Damballa discovers new toolset linked to
Destover
Attacker’s arsenal helps them to broaden attack
surface
November 18, 2015
Tags: Destover, malware, trojan
Destover is best known as the malware used in
the attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment in
November 2014, and also for its relationship
based on its wiping technique with the Shamoon
malware used in the attack on Saudi Aramco in
2012. The Destover trojan is a wiper that deletes
ﬁles off of an infected system, rendering it
useless.
Unlike most malware, the goal of Destover and
other wiping malware is to cause damage for
ideological and political reasons not for ﬁnancial
gain. For example, at Sony, attackers wiped ﬁles
off of workstations making them completely
inoperative for unclear political goals of the
attackers. The Saudi Aramco attack using Shamoon was so destructive it temporarily drove up the price
of hard drives because an estimated 50,000 were needed to help Saudi Aramco recover, also for
unclear ideological and political motives against the Al-Saud royal family.
Much was revealed In the weeks and months following these breaches, except for how attackers were
able to stay undetected within the network long enough to expand their presence and exﬁltrate
Terabytes of sensitive information.
While researching a newer sample of Destover, we came across two ﬁles that were identiﬁed by one

While researching a newer sample of Destover, we came across two ﬁles that were identiﬁed by one
antivirus product at the time under a generic signature. After analyzing further, we found two utilities
closely related to Destover. Both utilities would be used during an attack to evade detection while
moving laterally through a network to broaden the attack surface. Both utilities had usage statements
and were named as setMFT and afset.

What is setMFT?
setMFT is used to copy the timestamp settings from a source ﬁle on disk to a destination ﬁle, also
called timestomping. Timestomping combined with similar ﬁle naming enables a ﬁle to blend in with
legitimate ﬁles in the same directory. This can conceal a ﬁle’s existence from security personnel looking
for malicious ﬁles or scans of ﬁles created after a certain date. Timestomping can get past a cursory
check for malicious ﬁles. A thorough forensic examination will reveal that a ﬁle has been timestomped
based on conﬂicting record dates and possibly log ﬁles.
The sample discovered by Damballa requires the presence of the ﬁle ‘usbdrv3.sys’ in the same
directory. It turns out to be the renamed Eldos RawDisk driver used by Destover to gain direct access to
disk. Either the driver is meant to be delivered with setMFT or is dropped along with setMFT from
Destover itself. Destover and setMFT are related via the lengthy license key used with the Eldos driver:
99E2428CCA4309C68AAF8C616EF3306582A64513E55C786A864BC83DAFE0C78585B692047273
B0E55275102C664C5217E76B8E67F35FCE385E4328EE1AD139EA6AA26345C4F93000DBBC7EF1579D4F
Another feature is that this utility interacts with the attacker through on the command line rather than
being delivered and executed by a dropper without interaction. setMFT comes with an English usage
statement in case the attacker forgets the placement of arguments:

What is afset?
afset, like setMFT is also used to timestomp ﬁles plus clean Microsoft Windows logs based on criteria
(id, time) from the user. It also changes the PE build time and checksum. afset provides more granular
functionality to allow the user to set only certain timestamps on a ﬁle (sia, fna or both). To achieve the
timestomping and log cleaning functions, afset uses the RawDisk driver with the same lengthy license
key.
The afset sample we obtained appeared to be incomplete or a partial development version. The sample
attempted to write a randomly named ﬁle with a .sys extension to the local directory with the contents of
the “ICONS” resource which is supposed to be the encoded RawDisk driver. However, it failed to
decode on execution. If the driver write had completed it would have registered as a service using the
same random driver name. Plus, it would have been used to obtain a handle to write the MFT record for
the target ﬁle to match either a user supplied ﬁle or by default the ﬁle
“%SYSTEMROOT%\system32\tapi32.dll”.
According to the handy usage statement, conditional log cleaning is only available on 32-bit systems.
From our dynamic testing, it appears to clear the event log and then rewrite it without the offending
entries. A full reversing of the log cleaning feature was not performed and dynamic analysis failed due
to errors in the driver extraction routine from the resources. Fortunately, the usage statement gives
insight to the full functionality of the tool:

Afset is used interactively on the target system. It allows the attacker to remain stealthy and erase their
tracks as they move through the network. A full forensic analysis of a system would reveal the
presence of afset and missing log activity but it’s likely this activity would go undetected initially creating
high-risk infection dwell time.
For enterprise security teams, the utility of setMFT and afset means that many of the tools and methods
they use to identify the presence of attackers would be thwarted. If the adversary gains access to
corporate servers and can clean and redirect log ﬁles, they can prevent any evidence of their activity
from reaching a SIEM or log analysis solution.
These tools appear to have limited distribution, which means that newer versions of the tools could go
undetected by standard AV for an extended length of time. Also, as mentioned, the ability to have the
tools blend with legitimate system ﬁles allows the attacker to evade detection during a cursory glance
by personnel. These capabilities, when used together with tools that enable attackers to obtain network
credentials and disable defenses, allows them to permeate the network undetected for an extended
period of time.

Conclusion
The attackers behind large and long-lasting attacks are very well organized, patient and determined.
Toolsets like Destover, afset and setMFT are part of an arsenal used during a cyber attack. These tools
are mainly used to help the attackers remain under the radar for months or longer. Gaining a foothold
inside the victim’s network is a top priority. History tells us that in most of the high-proﬁle hacks making
news headlines, the attackers were able to spend months hidden inside the victim’s network exﬁltrating
Terabytes of data.

different steps. There is no doubt that attackers are using these tools right now and are continuing to
develop their capabilities.
