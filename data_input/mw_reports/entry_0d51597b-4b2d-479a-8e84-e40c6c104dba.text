Chubb, a major cybersecurity insurance provider for businesses hit by data breaches, has
itself become a target of a data breach.
The insurance giant told TechCrunch it was investigating a “security incident” involving the
unauthorized access to data belonging to an unnamed third-party. Chubb spokesperson
Jeffrey Zack said the company had “no evidence” the incident affected Chubb’s own network
and that its network “remains fully operational.”
But the spokesperson declined to comment further or answer any of our questions, including
if its customers were affected.
Brett Callow, a threat analyst at security firm Emsisoft, first alerted TechCrunch to the breach
on Thursday. According to Callow, the security incident was a data-stealing ransomware
attack launched by the Maze ransomware group. Maze not only spreads across a network,
infecting and encrypting every computer in its path, it also exfiltrates the data to the
attackers’ servers where it is held for ransom. If a ransom isn’t paid, the attackers publish the
files online.

In December, the FBI privately warned businesses of an increase in Maze-related
ransomware incidents.
Callow said the attackers behind the incident posted a listing on their website claiming to
have data stolen from Chubb in earlier in March. The listing included the names and email
addresses of three senior executives, including CEO Evan Greenberg.
At the time of writing, the attackers have not yet published any of the stolen files.
Chubb is one of the largest cybersecurity providers in the United States, offering incident
response services and covering companies from losses caused by data breaches. Target
last year filed a $74 million lawsuit against Chubb after the retailer claimed the insurance
carrier failed to properly compensate it for the costs incurred from its 2013 data breach
involving the theft of 110 million customers’ data.
