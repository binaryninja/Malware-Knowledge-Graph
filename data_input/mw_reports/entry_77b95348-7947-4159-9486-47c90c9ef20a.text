During her monolog on the Moth podcast back in 2011, Satori Shakoor described how she
returned to dating sometime after mourning the deaths of both her mother and her son. “So, I
went on Craigslist,“ she told the live audience, " 'cause Craigslist deliver right now.”
Craigslist, that old-fashioned website people still use to find things locally — and urgently —
has become the latest phishing vector. In addition to the inherent time pressure of its
marketplace, a feature on the site that appeals to phishers is the mail relay function. In the
service of safety and anonymity, Craigslist lets people seeking or offering things send an
email through the system to anyone else. What the recipient sees for a sender’s address is
<a long hex string>@<subdomain>.craigslist.org. Craigslist knows the identities of everyone,
but unless a correspondent discloses details, they are perfectly anonymous to others on the
system.
This situation suits phishers just fine. They can shoot their poisoned arrows from behind a
local mail proxy. And shoot they did — a number of times in early October.

Quick Takes: Attack Flow Overview
1/8

Type: phishing
Vector: fakes notifications sent from Craigslist
Payload: malware hosted on abused OneDrive page
Techniques: brand impersonation, abuse of the legitimate website
Platform: Gsuite and Office365
Target: Gsuite & Microsoft users

The Attack
In early October, several INKY users received real Craigslist email notifications informing
them that a published ad of theirs included “inappropriate content” and violated Craigslist’s
terms and conditions. The notifications gave false instructions on how to avoid having their
accounts deleted.
In our analysis, we learned that a common thread among recipients of this particular phish
was the fact that they were active Craigslist users. The notifications were “real” in the sense
that they really did come from a Craigslist domain, but they were fake in the sense that
Craigslist itself, either its humans or its machines, did not intend to send them. Without
verification from Craigslist, we can't be sure, but it appears as if Craigslist was compromised
since the recipients were not random (they posted ads on the platform) and the emails
originated from Craigslist.
A sample email looked like this:

That

big purple button looks pretty tempting.

However, if a recipient tried to rectify this supposed problem by clicking on the big purple
button, they were taken to a customized document uploaded to Microsoft OneDrive. It
appears as if bad actors were able to manipulate the email’s HTML to create that button and
link it to OneDrive. Recipients were then instructed to use the “Download” link on OneDrive
to fill out the form and return it to violations@craiglist.org.
Hovering over the link revealed a Russian domain (myjino[.]ru).

Victims who clicked saw “The online version is not available at the moment” and were asked
to download the form
Clicking on the link automatically downloaded a zip file named “form_148400455210012021.zip.”
Uncompressing the file revealed a macro-enabled spreadsheet named “form_148400455210012021.xls,” a document that had already been flagged by security vendors.

3/8

Not a good spreadsheet
The spreadsheet impersonated DocuSign and also used Norton and Microsoft logos to imply
that the file was safe. DocuSign does not in fact have a service called “DocuSign Protect
Service." The company itself observed this particular misuse of its brand in a posting on the
alerts section of its website from November 2020. It does have a service named “DocuSign
Protect and Sign.”

4/8

Not DocuSign, nor Norton, much less Microsoft
Users who clicked on “Enable Editing” and “Enable Content” bypassed Microsoft Office
security controls and allowed the macros to be executed.
We confirmed malicious activity in a malware sandbox. Files were created and modified. The
malware also attempted to make external connections to download more components or
exfiltrate data, but these attempts received a “404 not found” error.

5/8

View

from the sandbox
The error was likely due to a mistake on the part of the bad actors, or it's possible that the
malicious content was discovered on those hosts and had already been taken down.
If this attack had been successful, some of the possible outcomes could have been:
The installation of a remote access tool;
A full-blown ransomware attack;
The launching of Emotet to compromise an email account and use it to spam other
recipients;
The exfiltration of saved login credentials from a browser; or
The installation of a keylogger.

Techniques
Sent from an authentic Craigslist IP address (208.82.237.105), these attacks looked like real
Craigslist email notifications, which, because they appeared to be legitimate, were able to
pass standard email authentication (SPF, DKIM, and DMARC).

Header analysis showing legit sender
In this case, the recipient (the potential victim) had indeed posted a help-wanted listing,
seeking a housekeeper in Moscow.

Indication of original Craigslist posting
The phishers were able to manipulate the Craigslist email system to send a fake violation
notification to that individual. Since the URL to resolve the issue hosted a customized
document placed on Microsoft OneDrive, it did not appear on any threat intelligence feed,
allowing it to slip past most security vendors.

Recap of Techniques:
Brand impersonation — a macro-enabled spreadsheet festooned with logos of
DocuSign, Microsoft, and Norton implies safety and trust
Abuse of cloud and web resources — bad actors send fake violation emails from
Craigslist and lead victims to a legitimate but abused Microsoft OneDrive site that hosts
a customized document with a malware download link
Malware — macro-enabled spreadsheet manipulates files, attempts to download more
malware from an external source to infect the victim’s machine

Best Practices: Guidance and Recommendations

7/8

Recipients should be on the lookout for unusual requests. A red flag ought to go up right
away if a violation notice comes in that doesn’t correspond to any recipient behavior on the
platform in question.
Another red flag is the mixing of platforms. It doesn’t make sense to resolve a Craigslist
issue through a document uploaded to OneDrive.
Recipients should also be suspicious about the indirect way they are being asked to sign the
form. Proper protocol would have the form attached directly to the email rather than requiring
a trip up to OneDrive and an additional link-click there.
