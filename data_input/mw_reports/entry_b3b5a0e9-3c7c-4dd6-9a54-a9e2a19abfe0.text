Researchers at Palo Alto Networks recently published a report regarding the
NOKKI malware, which has shared code with KONNI and, although not in the report by
Palo Alto, KimJongRAT (discovered by Paul Rascagnères of Cisco Talos in 2013), and
another report on how there is evidence of the NOKKI malware connecting to the North
Korean threat actor known as APT37, Reaper, or Group123.
New report by @PaloAltoNtwks on #NOKKI malware with similarities to #KONNI also
has code relations to #KimJongRAT in a report from 2013 by @r00tbsd

The malicious document related to NOKKI, using VBScript, downloads a newly discovered
malware named Final1stspy, due to the PDB string inside. As noted by Palo Alto Networks,
Final1stspy comes in 2 components, the EXE named “LoadDll” with the sole purpose of
loading up a DLL payload, internally named “hadowexecute.” After collecting information
1/4

about the infected computer, the end result is that the DOGCALL malware, also known as
ROKRAT, is downloaded as the final payload, thus being one of the links between NOKKI
and APT37.

LINKS THROUGH CODE REUSE
The DLL payload component under the hash that was listed in the report was not available
on VirusTotal. We created some YARA signatures from the code of “LoadDll” and did a hunt
via VirusTotal. Since the EXE component shares code with the DLL, the YARA hunt led us
to find an earlier version of the DLL component of Final1stspy with 2/67 detections,
compilation timestamp of May 21, 2018, and first upload to VirusTotal date of July 11, 2018.
This is an earlier version than described in the Palo Alto report. After obtaining the
hadowexecute DLL component, we checked to see if there was any code reuse in the
Intezer Analyze™ system.

Intezer Analyze™
We see that there is some code shared between the EXE component of Final1stspy and
other code that has been seen before in the FreeMilk campaign which utilized ROKRAT.
Let’s see the shared code between ROKRAT and Final1stspy by doing comparison of these
functions in IDA. If you take a look, there is an identical match between them.

2/4

(ROKRAT & Final1stspy hadowexecute function comparison)
This function is unique code that has only been seen before in Group123’s ROKRAT and
the DLL component of Final1stspy. The identical function gathers information about the
operating system and stores it in the same format.

CONCLUSION
The evidence in Group123 being the threat actor involved here does not only lie in the final
delivered payload, but in the code itself. This code reuse provides more evidence towards
the relationship of KimJongRAT, KONNI, NOKKI, Final1stspy, ROKRAT, and APT37.
