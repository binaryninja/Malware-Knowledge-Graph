In May 2021, Fortinet published a report about the early stages of an ongoing phishing attack
against the Ukrainian government. The attack, initially based on the Saint Bot downloader,
also targeted Georgia as reported by Malwarebytes. Since June we have seen this threat
actor expand its operation with new samples targeting government entities in Georgia. In this
report we will cover the new malware samples we found.

Method of Infection
The attack’s entry point is a spear phishing email referencing government-related topics
including veterans, Ukraine’s Anti-Terrorist Operation (ATO), Georgia’s Internally Displaced
Persons (IDPs), organizations in Georgia’s private sector and COVID-19. The attack mainly
targets government agencies in Ukraine and Georgia.

The Malware
1/14

The main payload delivered by the malware is an infostealer written in AutoIt. Its main goal is
to steal files from the victim’s machine, uploading them to a predefined Command and control
(C2) server. Based on victimology and the fact that this attack tries to steal files from
government entities, a classic goal of nation-state groups, it is likely operated by a Russian
nation-state. There are also several similarities between this attack and past APT28
campaigns which we will discuss later. Below we summarize the early stages of the attack
and show the latest malware targeting government entities in Georgia. We assess with high
confidence that this attack may expand its operations to target additional Eastern European
countries.

Technical Analysis
The attack flow, described below, begins with a phishing email containing a malicious
shortened URL. The URL redirects to a Command and control (C2) where a ZIP file or
malicious document is hosted. The ZIP file contains a malicious file and in some emails also a
harmless PDF file. The malicious attachment varies between RTF, DOC, PDF, JS, LNK or
EXE. Its main goal is to drop the packed payloads from the C2. The method in which a
dropper contacts the C2 in order to deliver the packed payload varies between the different
file types and stages of the attack. The packed executable loads an AutoIt payload into
memory. The payload searches for files on the victim’s machine based on a list of file
extensions and uploads them to a C2 that is hardcoded in the script.

Attack flow.
An example of one of the phishing emails sent to the Ukrainian government is below. The
threat actor references payments made to veterans of the Anti-Terrorist Operation (ATO).

Phishing email sent to the Ukrainian government. Translation from Ukrainian – Subject:
“Payments to ATO Veterans.” Content: “It must be filled in and sent back.”
The link, masqueraded as a Ukrainian .gov domain, is actually a shortened URL
(https[://]cutt[.]ly/WcBTVdf) which contacts http[://]gosloto[.]site/doc/form_request.doc and
downloads form_request.doc to the victim’s machine. This document is an RTF file that once
runs will present content related to the Israeli Merkava, the main battle tank used by the
Israeli Defense Forces.

Reference to Israeli Merkava in the RTF file.
This file is incharge of dropping the final payload from the C2. In other phishing emails, this
file is named NATO_06042021 (44697aad796c0d82c1adbee15fd1266b).

First we Take Kyiv, then we Take Tbilisi
Combined with continuous attacks against Ukraine, the threat actor has expanded its
campaign to target government entities in Georgia. The following malicious documents were
uploaded to VirusTotal from Georgia on June 17 and July 5.

The PDF File
The PDF file, named “Georgia_Private_Sector_Poster_Inputs_06_2021.pdf,” was uploaded to
VirusTotal on June 17, 2021. The PDF contains an action object. Upon a victim opening the
PDF it will send a query to Google containing the C2: http://www[.]google[.]com/url?
q=http%3A%2F%2F93482432493824792343432843240234327488
92349702394023.xyz&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFWmVffgSGlrrv-2U9sSOJYzfUQqw) The
system will prompt a security warning allowing the document to contact
“http[:]//www.google.com.”

System prompt message.

Once the document connects to Google a short series of network redirections occurs. First,
Google will redirect to the C2’s URL. Then, as described in the image below, the C2 contains
a frame with an src to another C2 URL (https[://]16868138130[.]space/000/), which then
redirects to a shortened URL (https[://]qaz[.]im/load/rKtsZD/hDKKFD) using a meta refresh
redirect. This will finally drop georgia_private_sector_poster_inputs_06_2021.cpl
(02f0118bd15dabf727659b9fd27c86c9).

Network redirections for delivering the payload.
This redirection process, starting with Google as the first domain the PDF attempts to access,
is an obvious Antivirus evasion technique.
georgia_private_sector_poster_inputs_06_2021.cpl is a DLL which upon clicking on it, runs
under a trusted control panel process. The DLL is incharge of dropping and running the
packed payload from the C2, 16868138130[.]space/000/000.exe

The AutoIt script’s main goal is to upload files from the victim’s machine to a predefined C2.
The main logic (see image below) calls the _filsearch function (two images below) which looks
for files containing the following extensions:
*.doc;*.pdf;*.ppt;*.dot;*.xl;*.csv;*.rtf;*.dot;*.mdb;*.accdb;*.pot;*.pps;*.ppa;*.rar;*.zip;*.tar;*.7z;*.txt.

_filsearch uses @ComSpec environment variable (which usually points to CMD). The process
tree created by the AutoIt file is below.

Each file is uploaded to the C2 via a multipart/form-data POST request. The file’s directory is
sent as Hex. Below is an example of a file upload request.

Lastly, the AutoIt script creates and runs a batch named “r.bat” which deletes the malware
from disk and kills the process.

The Document Files
Both malicious Word documents uploaded to VirusTotal on July 5 display similar behavior.
Let’s look at 900e892c8151f0f59a93af1206583ce6. Once a user opens this document, it will
run a VBA macro with the main logic to create, write to and run a batch file named
“ballDemocrat.bat.” The script written to the batch file will run a PowerShell command that
drops an executable from the C2 (http[://]1221[.]site/15858415841/0407.exe) and saves it as
centuryarticle.exe.

The file dropped from the C2 is a packed .NET file that loads the AutoIt payload into memory.

Possible Russian Connection
We noticed similarities between this attack and Russia’s APT28 campaigns. While these
similarities alone are not enough to attribute APT28, victimology and intent to conduct
espionage on various government entities in Eastern European regions gives us reason to
believe that Russia is behind the attack.
1. Victimology: APT28 has targeted Ukraine and Georgia in the past. [1][2][3]
2. Phishing theme: APT28 previously used COVID-19-related phishing themes to target
countries including Ukraine. APT28 also used NATO as a phishing theme in the past. [1]
[2][4][5]
3. Use of AutoIt: One of Zebrocy’s (malware from APT28) variants is written in AutoIt. [6]
[7]
4. File search with predefined extensions: Zebrocy searches for predefined file
extensions on the victim machine. [8][9][13]
5. Compressed file holding both malicious and benign files was used in an APT28
COVID-19 phishing attack last year and in other campaigns in the past. [4][8]
6. Use of spear phishing emails containing URL-shortener was documented in past
APT28 campaigns. In one of the campaigns, this URL hosted a ZIP file containing a
benign PDF and a malicious executable. [8][10][11]
7. Use of Hex encoding: The Zebrocy AutoIt version uses String to Hex encoding. [7]
8. Use of batch files, PowerShell and CMD are part of APT28’s documented TTPs. [8]
[12]

Mitigation
Take the following precautions to keep your organization clean and safe from phishing
attacks.
1. Enhance social engineering awareness within your organization.
2. Use an email gateway to analyze attachments and links. Intezer Analyze now supports
analysis for Microsoft Office documents, PDFs and scripts.

3. Conduct proactive threat hunting on all endpoints inside your organization to routinely
ensure that no traces of malicious code or malware exist in-memory. Intezer’s live
Endpoint Scanner can help you achieve this at scale by collecting all binaries running inmemory, including fileless, and classifying them using Genetic Code Analysis
technology. We also have a Volatility plugin for analyzing memory dumps.
