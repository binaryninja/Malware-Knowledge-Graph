Palmerworm: Espionage Gang Targets the Media,
Finance, and Other Sectors
symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/palmerworm-blacktech-espionage-apt

The Threat Hunter Team at Symantec, a division of Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), has
uncovered a new espionage campaign carried out by the Palmerworm group (aka
BlackTech) involving a brand new suite of custom malware, targeting organizations in Japan,
Taiwan, the U.S., and China.
The attacks occurred in 2019 and continued into 2020, targeting organizations in the media,
construction, engineering, electronics, and finance sectors. We observed the group using
previously unseen malware in these attacks.
Palmerworm uses a combination of custom malware, dual use tools, and living-off-the-land
tactics in this campaign. Palmerworm has been active since at least 2013, with the first
activity seen in this campaign in August 2019.

Tactics, Tools, and Procedures
Palmerworm was observed using both dual-use tools and custom malware in these attacks.
Among the custom malware families we saw it use were:
Backdoor.Consock
Backdoor.Waship
1/3

Backdoor.Dalwit
Backdoor.Nomri
We have not observed the group using these malware families in previous attacks – they
may be newly developed tools, or the evolution of older Palmerworm tools. Malware used by
Palmerworm in the past has included:
Backdoor.Kivars
Backdoor.Pled
While the custom malware used by the group in this campaign is previously undocumented,
other elements of the attack bear similarities to past Palmerworm campaigns, making us
reasonably confident that it is the same group carrying out this campaign.
As well as the four backdoors mentioned, we also see the group using a custom loader and
a network reconnaissance tool, which Symantec detects as Trojan Horse and Hacktool. The
group also used several dual-use tools, including:
Putty – can be leveraged by attackers for remote access, to exfiltrate data and send it
back to attackers
PSExec – is a legitimate Microsoft tool that can be exploited by malicious actors and
used for lateral movement across victim networks
SNScan – this tool can be used for network reconnaissance, to find other potential
targets on victim networks
WinRAR – is an archiving tool that can be used to compress files (potentially to make
them easier to send back to attackers) and also to extract files from zipped folders
All these dual-use tools are commonly exploited by malicious actors like Palmerworm, with
advanced persistent threat (APT) groups like this increasingly using living-off-the-land tactics,
including the use of dual-use tools, in recent years. These tools provide attackers with a
good degree of access to victim systems without the need to create complicated custom
malware that can more easily be linked back to a specific group.
In this campaign, Palmerworm is also using stolen code-signing certificates to sign its
payloads, which makes the payloads appear more legitimate and therefore more difficult for
security software to detect. Palmerworm has been publicly documented using stolen codesigning certificates in previous attack campaigns.
We did not see what infection vector Palmerworm used to gain initial access to victim
networks in this campaign, however, in the past the group has been documented as using
spear-phishing emails to gain access to victim networks.

Victims

2/3

Symantec identified multiple victims in this campaign, in a number of industries, including
media, construction, engineering, electronics, and finance. The media, electronics, and
finance companies were all based in Taiwan, the engineering company was based in Japan,
and the construction company in China. It is evident Palmerworm has a strong interest in
companies in this region of East Asia.
We also observed Palmerworm activity on some victims in the U.S., however, we were
unable to identify the sector of the companies targeted.
Palmerworm activity was first spotted in this campaign in August 2019, when activity was
seen on the network of a Taiwanese media company and a construction company in China.
The group remained active on the network of the media company for a year, with activity on
some machines there seen as recently as August 2020.
Palmerworm also maintained a presence on the networks of a construction and a finance
company for several months. However, it spent only a couple of days on the network of a
Japanese engineering company in September 2019, and a couple of weeks on the network
of an electronics company in March 2020. It spent approximately six months on one of the
U.S.-based machines on which we observed activity.
