By The PhishLabs Team | March 13, 2018
A newly observed variant of BankBot has been discovered masquerading as Adobe Flash
Player, Avito, and an HD Video Player. This variant, now detected by PhishLabs as BankBot
Anubis, was first identified on March 5, 2018.
BankBot Anubis takes mobile threats to the next level incorporating ransomware, keylogger
abilities, remote access trojan functions, SMS interception, call forwarding, and lock screen
functionality.
Android Banking Trojans are sinister enough on their own; however, there is now a growing
trend of integrating the functionality of other malware genres alongside Banker’s typical
phishing overlay and SMS-stealing capabilities. According to our research, Lokibot was the
first Android banking trojan to integrate ransomware functionality. Now, one BankBot actor is
further upping the ante with code aimed at delivering functionality that ranges from
ransomware to remote access.
When the BankBot source code was first publicly leaked, many researchers forecasted an
increase in the number of threat actors using the malware and a spike in the development of
new variants with unique features. This forecast has now come to fruition, and multiple
variants are currently active.
When reviewing recent detections we noticed that some new network endpoints had been
introduced to the command and control (C2) server infrastructure of one of the variants
PhishLabs tracks. These new endpoints clued us into the new functionality and feature juicy
names like locker, keylogger, and ratgate.
Figure 1 illustrates the typical set of PHP files referenced in earlier samples (left) alongside
the PHP files referenced in recent samples.

The BankBot malware’s configuration is stored in a file named ‘set.xml’ in the application’s
‘shared prefs’ directory. This file is updated following installation, giving additional clues
regarding the new functionality.
Figure 2 shows an example of the static configuration and Figure 3 shows an updated
version. The updated version, which stores a base64-encoded image as part of an HTML
file, has been truncated for readability.

Locker – AnubisCrypt
As seen in the configuration, there are several entries related to the new ransomware
functionality. These include ‘htmllocker’, which is updated after installation to contain the
HTML code for a lock screen. This lock screen, shown in Figure 4, contains a poorly-worded

message about illicit activity being detected on the victim’s phone.

Figure 4. Lock screen

While the lock screen is reminiscent of other locking ransomware that simply disables access
to the user interface, this implementation is indeed crypto ransomware. Some of the code
responsible for the ransomware functionality is shown in Figure 5. The encrypted files are
renamed with the extension ‘.AnubisCrypt’ and files are encrypted using a 256-bit symmetric
key.

Additional configuration fields related to the ransomware functionality include lock_btc ,
lock_amount, and key. These fields are updated via communication with the C2 server and
were never updated during execution of the samples analyzed for this article. Figure 6 shows
the code for populating these configuration entries. It appears that files encrypted with
AnubisCrypt will be recoverable, based upon the symmetric key being stored in the
configuration.

Remote Access Trojan
In addition to the ransomware functionality detailed above, this version of BankBot now
contains remote access trojan (RAT) functionality. Commands available via the RAT service
include Open Directory, Download File, Delete File/Folder, Start & Stop VNC, and Stop &
Start Sound Recording. This functionality allows the attacker to directly manipulate the file
system and monitor the victim’s activity. Figure 7 displays code for some of the
aforementioned RAT functions.

The malicious actor behind this update has also implemented keylogger functionality. The
ability to record sound and log keystrokes makes this malware both potent and remarkably
invasive. Figure 8 shows the implementation of the keylogger functionality, including the
name of the log file.

Banking Trojan & Additional Functionality
Even with all the new functionality, BankBot is still a banking trojan at heart. Like most
Android bankers, BankBot monitors for a targeted application to be launched, and then
overlays the legitimate app with a phishing screen to steal the victim’s credentials. It then
uses its SMS theft capabilities to intercept any subsequent security codes sent from the
bank.
Additional functionality found in BankBot Anubis includes:

Monitor for attempts to remove the malware or reset the system
Abuse accessibility features to authorize actions on behalf of the user
Send, receive, and intercept SMS
Lock the screen with an overlay
Display fake notifications and alerts
Collect system information such as installed applications, IP address, and GPS location
Request additional permissions
Send USSD requests
Forward calls to a specified number
Launch applications & open URLs
Update command and control servers
Clear configuration data to kill the bot

Campaign Details
The samples analyzed for this article targeted a total of 275 unique applications from
organizations across the globe. Recent additions to this list of targets include 29
cryptocurrency applications. The domains utilized for command and control in these samples
were registered from a variety of geolocations, including Japan, Moldova, and France. The
infrastructure was hosted on servers in Ukraine, Germany, and the Netherlands.
Nearly all of the relevant strings in the sample are in English although there are some
grammatical and spelling errors. The malware configuration contains one string in Bulgarian
(perehvat_sws → intercept SMS), however, the fact that this variant is based on leaked
source code renders this less meaningful. This updated variant has been observed
masquerading as Adobe Flash Player, Avito, and an HD Video Player.

We published this in an earlier blog post (The Evolution of Mobile Banking Trojans… and
What To Do About Them (Part II) but it’s worth mentioning again to help safeguard against
mobile threats.

Staying Safe
As an individual, there are plenty of things you can do to minimize the chances of your
devices being infected by mobile banking trojans. Among other things, you can:
Watch out for suspicious activity on your device and associated accounts, e.g., New
and unknown device admin users being added, apps requesting extensive
permissions, and strange activity on accounts accessed via mobile.
Use antivirus software. This will help you to detect indicators that can’t be identified
manually.
Don’t root your devices, and don’t change your settings to allow apps from unknown
sources. Seriously, just don’t do it.
Don’t install apps distributed by SMS, email, or ads, and don’t visit unofficial app stores.
Exercise caution even when installing from official stores. Only follow links to
applications from trusted sites, and if you’re in any doubt, don’t install.
Keep software and operating systems up to date, as many malware variants prey on
older, insecure versions.
Enable account notifications from your bank. Most banks offer these for when certain
types of activity are detected.

9/10

But of course, mobile banking trojans aren’t just an issue for individuals. If you’re concerned
your organization or customers could be harmed by mobile banking trojans, there are are
several steps you can take:
Attacks will happen. Educate your customers, particularly if your organization offers
one or more legitimate apps through official app stores, and provide users with best
practice information.
Allow users to report attacks or suspicious applications, and make sure you look into
each reported incident.
Make use of alternative two-factor authentication techniques (i.e., not SMS) – Physical
tokens, biometrics, and one-time password applications are all good options.
Monitor transactions and IP geolocation information to identify suspicious activity. On
the same note, provide your users with an easy way of informing you about upcoming
travel or significant activity in order to avoid unnecessary lockouts.
Offer account notifications to inform your users of suspicious activity.
