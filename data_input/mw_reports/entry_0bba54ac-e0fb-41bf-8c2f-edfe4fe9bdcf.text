The source of the report intelligence is sensitive TLP: RED internal communications
between Conti and TrickBot operators. The report is declassified as TLP: WHITE in the
interest of public awareness.

Our investigative intelligence work at AdvIntel is primarily directed at top-tier cybercriminal
groups. We perceive cybercrime as a constantly-maturing community from which its most
skilled actors merge together to form elite collectives, capable of taking down GDP-size
infrastructures and extorting tens of millions of dollars, while the less gifted are left to gossip
on darknet forums.

In past years, we’ve established visibility into even the most advanced cyber gangs and
syndicates, but within this selective world, there has been one group that has been
especially outstanding—TrickBot.

TrickBot: Origins
2/7

AdvIntel has been closely following TrickBot since it was primarily a banking trojan designed
to steal personal financial data. By 2019, it had evolved into the most prolific tool of
information theft.

TrickBot relies on a modular system. This means that its separate modules can be utilized for
different purposes, making it especially flexible malware. For instance, in July 2020, TrickBot
test piloted a mysterious module known as grabber.dll linked to the arrest of Vladimir
Dunaev, identified by AdvIntel earlier. The module version was meant for browser theft and
affected Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge as well as
browser cookies.

The Future of Cybercrime

In October 2021, TrickBot even developed a function designed to inspect the UEFI/BIOS
firmware of its targets, in order to survive any system re-imagining efforts during the recovery
phase of a Ryuk (Conti) ransomware event, further allowing adversaries to semi-permanently
brick an affected device. The installation framework of TrickBot’s notorious AchorDNS
malware has also been used by some of the most notorious (specifically Russian and North
Korean) threat actors to target healthcare, finance, telecoms, education, and critical
infrastructure.

By 2019, TrickBot possessed a highly developed organizational network, with operations in
all avenues of cybercrime.

However, the most salient and worrisome prediction for TrickBot was its role as the most
dangerous tool in ransomware’s future arsenal. The group’s elite division, called Overdose,
managed the TrickBot campaigns that resulted in the creation of Conti and Ryuk
ransomware. The group has made at least $200 million USD with one extreme case
extorting ~$34 million USD from a single victim and has perpetrated a spate of attacks on
numerous healthcare organizations, including Universal Health Services (UHS) via
BazarBackdoor to Ryuk ransomware (the attack was estimated for an account for $67 Million
USD in damages).

AdvIntel has been tracking this specialization of TrickBot since its early stages, remaining
vigilant in monitoring its relationship with Ryuk (now Conti) which became one of the most
damaging cybercrime alliances in recent history. After Ryuk’s rebrand and subsequent
attempt to take down TrickBot in October, we have observed that this partnership in crime
began to change.

Notably, Alla Witte, a Latvian national who was hired under the alias "max" to develop
another ransomware internally called "Enigma" or "Diavol" for TrickBot backwards
compatibility, is to be extradited and arrested by the Department of Justice.

An Offer TrickBot Couldn’t Refuse

In 2022, Conti has expanded to the point that they now fit the definition of a crime syndicate,
hitting many key hallmarks such as A) the unification of many highly skilled and proficient
members of the same craft with little autonomy (in contrast to other RaaS groups) and B) the
organization’s clear end-goal to monopolize the market. Currently, only EvilCorp has earned
this title in the ransomware community.

Its relationship with TrickBot was one of the primary reasons for the rapid rise of Conti,
possibly even for its survival. The Emotet-TrickBot-Ryuk supply chain was extremely
resilient. And with a stable and high-quality supply of accesses coming from a single
organized source, Conti was able to maintain its image without any major structural changes.
When the rest of the ransomware gangs were massively hiring random affiliates and
delegating them to breach corporate networks, Conti was working in a trust-based, teambased manner. And when said random affiliates began to randomly hack Western
infrastructure and randomly blackmail Western leaders, calling the wrath of the Russian
security apparatus on their heads, Conti merely kept a clear code of conduct and continued
operations as normal.

As its competitors began going down one-by-one, either hit by the sudden crackdown of
Russia’s government or simply incapable of breaching enough networks to survive, Conti
prospered. Suddenly TrickBot, formally Conti’s partner and equal, was turning into its
subsidiary. At the same time, Conti turned into the sole end-user of TrickBot’s botnet product.
By the end of 2021, Conti had essentially acquired TrickBot, with multiple elite developers
and managers joining the ransomware cosa nostra.

BazarBackdoor’s Kiss of Death

At this point, AdvIntel’s adversarial visibility can clearly confirm that TrickBot is still
operational, however, the botnet is reaching its limits. According to our sensitive source
intelligence, the availability of TrickBot IOCs has made it highly detectable, and Conti is no
longer using it.

6/7

Conti has already hired TrickBot’s top members, and can now invest in newer and better
products. TakeBazarBackdoor - TrickBot group’s newer, stealthier replacement malware that
is now being leveraged at high-value targets. BazarBackdoor was formerly a part of
Trickbot’s toolkit arsenal but has now become its own fully autonomous tool.

Moreover, the Conti syndicate is powerful enough to have even summoned Emotet from the
dead, not to mention QBot and IcedID, with more sophisticated email campaigns dropping
Cobalt Strike.

Leaving the “Backdoor” Open for a Sequel

In name, at least, this means that TrickBot’s four-year saga is now coming to a close—the
liaison that has defined the cybercrime domain for years has been reborn into a newer,
possibly even deadlier form.

However, the people who have led TrickBot throughout its long run will not simply disappear.
After being “acquired” by Conti, they are now rich in prospects with the secure ground
beneath them, and Conti will always find a way to make use of the available talent.

In addition to monitoring TrickBot, AdvIntel provides early warning services for all its
alternatives used by the top-ransomware groups, including Emotet, QBot, IcedID, Log4shell
CVE adversarial datasets, and others.
