Spamhaus Botnet
Threat Update
Q3 2022
Well, Q3 was a busy quarter. There was no vacation for
botnet C&Cs this year. With a 38% increase in botnet C&Cs
detected by the research team, there was a lot of movement
across all the charts with multiple new entries. There is a
strong Chinese element felt throughout this report as we see
a vast amount of botnet C&Cs out of China relating to Cobalt
Strike – a legitimate penetration testing tool being used for
nefarious purposes.
Welcome to the Spamhaus Botnet Threat Update Q3 2022.

About this report
Spamhaus tracks both Internet Protocol
(IP) addresses and domain names used
by threat actors for hosting botnet
command & control (C&C) servers. This
data enables us to identify associated
elements, including the geolocation of the
botnet C&Cs, the malware associated with
them, the top-level domains used when
registering a domain for a botnet C&C, and
the sponsoring registrars and the network
hosting the botnet C&C infrastructure.

This report provides an overview of the
number of botnet C&Cs associated with
these elements, along with a quarterly
comparison. We discuss the trends we
are observing and highlight service
providers struggling to control the number
of botnet operators abusing their services.

Initial Access Brokers – are they selling
access to your network?
Initial Access Brokers (IABs) have been one of the top
threats over the past years. But what are they, and why
are they so dangerous?

An explanation
The term “Initial Access Brokers” refers to threat
actors who usually operate in groups, trying to breach
corporate networks. They use various tactics, techniques,
and procedures (TTPs) to achieve their goals.

Ways IABs operate
One of their preferred TTPs is to spread malware via
opportunistic or targeted malspam campaigns. For
this purpose, brokers either develop their own piece of
malware or rent access to Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS)
botnets. The list of malware families known to be used
by such brokers is long: Emotet, IcedID, Dridex, Qakbot,
and many more. One of the most recent emerging threats
used by such brokers is BumbleBee. You can read more
about the rise of BumbleBee in this update.

However, malware isn’t the only way these IABs enter
your corporate network. Another tactic is to exploit
exposed software or devices connected to the internet.
Brokers focus on known software vulnerabilities that
potential victims have failed to patch (e.g., Microsoft
Exchange Servers). Alternatively, they’ll use brute force
attacks where weak credentials are employed, e.g.,
for remote access.

And after they’ve breached your network…?
Initially, the broker will try to identify which network
they have penetrated. Important information for the
attackers to ascertain is the organization’s country and
sector along with its size, e.g., the number of employees
& revenue.
Armed with a good understanding of the value attached
to the “asset”, the broker will then engage with potential
buyers to see who wants to purchase access to the
victim’s network.

And then?
What happens from this point forwards wholly depends
on the buyer. They may not use the access immediately.
On the other hand, the buyer may immediately conduct
reconnaissance and lateral movement as soon as they
have access, which may lead to full encryption of the
victim’s network with ransomware within just a couple
of hours.

How can you protect against IABs?
While this may sound scary, there are simple ways
to protect yourself from this kind of threat.
1.	Watch out for indicators of potential compromise
on the network level and your endpoints.
2.	Secure any remote access with multi-factor
authentication (MFA).
3.	Deploy critical security patches as soon as possible,
once they are released.
This may sound like security 101, but breaches regularly
occur because organizations do not follow these best
common practices.

Number of botnet C&Cs observed,
Q3 2022
In Q3 2022, Spamhaus identified 4,331 botnet C&Cs
compared to 3,141 in Q2 2022. This was a 38% increase
quarter on quarter. The monthly average increased from
1,047 in Q2 to 1,444 botnet C&Cs per month in Q3.

What are botnet command
& controllers?
A ‘botnet controller,’ ‘botnet C2’ or
‘botnet command & control’ server
is commonly abbreviated to ‘botnet
C&C.’ Fraudsters use these to both
control malware-infected machines
and extract personal and valuable
data from malware-infected victims.
Botnet C&Cs play a vital role
in operations conducted by
cybercriminals who are using
infected machines to send out
spam or ransomware, launch
DDoS attacks, commit e-banking
fraud or click-fraud, or mine
cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.
Desktop computers and mobile
devices, like smartphones, aren’t
the only machines that can become
infected. There is an increasing
number of devices connected to the
internet, for example, the Internet of
Things (IoT), devices like webcams,
network attached storage (NAS),
and many more items. These are
also at risk of becoming infected.

Geolocation of botnet C&Cs,
Q3 2022
Botnet C&C boom in China
The number of newly observed botnet C&C servers in
China went through the roof last quarter - we recorded
a 3884% increase in botnet C&C activity in China. That’s
more than 900 additional botnet C&Cs than we saw in Q2.
Most of the activity in this region was related to misuse of
the legitimate penetration testing tool, Cobalt Strike.

Increase in botnet C&C activity in central
Europe and North America
We saw an increase in botnet C&C activity across central
Europe, including Switzerland (+126%), United Kingdom
(+116%), Germany (+57%), France (+54%) and Netherlands
(+36%). Meanwhile, the United States experienced a 140%
increase in botnet C&Cs, and Canada was a new entry
at #11.

Improvements across Eastern Europe
An interesting observation for Q3 is that overall, many
Eastern European countries experienced a decrease
in the numbers of botnet C&Cs, e.g., Bulgaria, Latvia,
Moldova, Romania and Ukraine. As a result, these
countries all departed from our quarterly ranking.
Nice work!

Significant decrease in Russia
One surprise in Q3 was a significant decrease in the
number of newly observed botnet C&Cs in Russia.
The number fell by 891, from 1254 botnet C&Cs
in Q2 to only 363 in Q3. That’s reduced by almost
three quarters (-71%).

Improvements continue across the
LatAm region
With the exception of Brazil, the situation in LatAm
countries continues to improve in Q3, as it has done since
the beginning of the year. The Dominican Republic (-44%)
and Mexico (-24%), both experienced a reduction in the
number of botnet C&Cs. Let’s hope they drop off the
Top 20 in Q4, just as Uruguay did in Q2.

Malware associated with botnet C&Cs,
Q3 2022
Cobalt Strike strikes!
We have previously reported on Cobalt Strike - sadly,
despite being a legitimate tool, Cobalt Strike is extensively
used by threat actors with malicious intent, for example,
to deploy ransomware. Last quarter, we identified almost
2,000 new Cobalt Strike botnet C&Cs, making it the most
dominant threat in Q3.

RedLineStealer C&Cs go through the roof
RedLineStealer has been present in our Top 20 for
years. However, the number of newly observed C&Cs
associated with RedLineStealer exploded in Q3 by 409%,
from 77 to 392. RedLine is one of the most successful
credential stealers, sold as Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS)
on the dark web.

RATs and more RATs!
Remote Access Trojans (RATs) have always been very
popular among threat actors - in Q3, they accounted
for 35% of all botnet C&Cs. Increases occurred across
almost all of the popular RATs that criminals are
currently selling on the dark web, including DCRat
with 521% (#10), NanoCore with 264% (#15) and
Remcos with 200% (#10).

Hello, BumbleBee!
Heard about BumbleBee before? If not, keep reading!
BumbleBee is a backdoor that provides threat actors
access to the victim’s machine. Like Emotet and IcedID,
BumbleBee acts as an Initial Access Broker, selling
access to compromised corporate networks on the
dark web that often leads to ransomware. In Q3,
BumbleBee eclipsed all its competitors, including
Emotet. We suggest you keep a close eye on this
threat over the coming months!

7 | Spamhaus Botnet Threat Update Q3–2022

What is Cobalt Strike?
Cobalt Strike is a legitimate
commercial penetration testing tool
that allows an attacker to deploy an
“agent” on a victim’s machine.

Malware associated with botnet C&Cs,
Q3 2022 (continued)
Emotet
Since we’ve mentioned Emotet, we thought some readers
might wonder if its appearance in the Top 20 means this
malware is back up and running following its takedown in
January 2021. The truth is that while our researchers are
observing botnet C&Cs firing, we haven’t seen Emotet
activity for some time i.e., the house door may be open,
but no one is home.

Flubot labeling
Although FluBot’s activity decreased massively in the
second half of 2022, we continue to see a high number
of newly observed botnet C&Cs associated with it.
As we’ve mentioned in previous updates, this is because
Flubot is using a technique called “FastFlux” to host its
botnet C&Cs. The same botnet infrastructure also serves
as C&Cs for other malware families, such as TeamBot.
To make our internal tracking of this threat easier, we
continue to label the associated infrastructure as “FluBot.”

Most abused top-level domains,
Q3 2022
Freenom continues to dominate our Top 20
While a few of the TLDs operated by Freenom improved
over the last quarter, others had marked increases in the
number of new botnet C&Cs associated with them. TLDs
gq, tk, ga, ml, cf are all operated by Freenom and appear
too frequently in the Top 20. Come on, Freenom – you
can do better.

Increase in botnet C&Cs hosted on LatAm TLDs
When it comes to the LatAm region, both ccTLD .co (#13)
and .br (#20) both experienced significant increases in
botnet C&Cs associated with their TLDs in Q3.

Interpreting the data
Registries with a greater number of active domains have
greater exposure to abuse. For example, in Q3 2022,
.com had more than 150 million domains, of which 0.001%
were associated with botnet C&Cs. Meanwhile, .ga had
approximately 6,500 domains, of which 3.263% were
associated with botnet C&Cs. Both are in the top ten
of our listings. Still, one had a much higher percentage
of domains related to botnet C&Cs than the other.

Top-level domains (TLDs)
a brief overview
There are a couple of different
top-level domains (TLDs) including:
Generic TLDs (gTLDs) - these are
under ICANN jurisdiction. Some
TLDs are open i.e. can be used by
anyone e.g., .com, some have strict
policies regulating who and how
they can be used e.g., .bank, and
some are closed e.g., .honda.
Country code TLDs (ccTLDs) typically these relate to a country
or region. Registries define the
policies relating to these TLDs;
some allow registrations from
anywhere, some require local
presence, and some license their
namespace wholesale to others.

Most abused top-level domains,
Q3 2022 (continued)
Working together with the industry for
a safer internet
Naturally, our preference is for no TLDs to have botnet
C&Cs linked with them, but we live in the real world
and understand there will always be abuse.
What is crucial is that abuse is dealt with quickly.
Where necessary, if domain names are registered
solely for distributing malware or hosting botnet C&Cs,
we would like registries to suspend these domain names.
We greatly appreciate the efforts of many registries
who work with us to ensure these actions are taken.

Most abused domain registrars,
Q3 2022
Kudos to Key Systems and PDR
The German-based domain registrar Key Systems and
Indian-based PDR have both improved massively. PDR’s
numbers have dropped by 46%, and Key Systems has
completely dropped off the Top 20. Other departures
are CentralNic, dnspod.cn, Gransy, Launchpad, and
OwnRegistrar. Well done to you all!

Russian domain registrars on the rise (again)
We have seen an increase in fraudulent domain
registrations across Russian-based domain registrars,
specially RegRU (+50%) and Ru-Center (new entry).
We hope that the situation at these two registrars
will improve in the coming quarter.

Ups and downs at NameSilo and Namecheap
The two North American domain registrars, NameSilo
(CA) and Namecheap (US), continue to lead our
quarterly ranking. While the number of newly observed
botnet C&C domains registered through their services
improved in Q2, the situation worsened in Q3 with an
increase of 18% and 5%, respectively. We suspect (sadly)
that both will continue to lead our ranking in Q4.

Networks hosting the most newly
observed botnet C&Cs, Q3 2022
There was even more movement than usual in Q3 among
the Top 20 networks hosting the largest number of
botnet C&Cs. With 15 new entries and departures, there’s
plenty to catch up on…

Does this list reflect how quickly networks deal
with abuse?
While this Top 20 listing illustrates that there may be
an issue with customer vetting processes at the named
network, it doesn’t reflect on the speed abuse desks
deal with reported problems. See the next section in this
report, “Networks hosting the most active botnet C&Cs”,
to view networks where abuse isn’t dealt with promptly.

Chinese networks skyrocket to the top!
As mentioned earlier, the number of botnet C&Cs hosted
in China soared in Q3! Two cloud hosting providers
contributing to this increase were Tencent and Alibaba,
taking the top two spots in our Top 20.

A disappointing reappearance from Hetzner
If you are one of our regular readers, Hetzner will
undoubtedly ring bells. Many moons ago, Hetzner was
a favorite among threat actors for hosting botnet C&Cs.
Thankfully, Hetzner managed to address these abuse
problems and as a result didn’t appear in our Top 20 for
some time… until now. We are disappointed to see that
Hetzner is evidently struggling with botnet C&C abuse;
and we desperately hope this is just a “blip” and they
can rapidly rectify these issues.

15 | Spamhaus Botnet Threat Update Q3–2022

Networks and botnet
C&C operators?
Networks have a reasonable
amount of control over operators
who fraudulently sign-up for
a new service.
A robust customer verifica-tion/
vetting process should occur
before commissioning a service.
Where networks have a high
number of listings, it highlights
one of the following issues:
1. Networks are not following
best practices for customer
verification processes.
2. Networks are not ensuring that
ALL their resellers follow sound
customer verification practices.
In some of the worst-case
scenarios, employees or owners
of networks are directly benefiting
from fraudulent sign-ups, i.e.,
knowingly taking money from
miscreants in return for hosting their
botnet C&Cs; however, thankfully,
this doesn’t often happen.

Networks hosting the most newly
observed botnet C&Cs, Q3 2022
(continued)
Threat actors love western cloud providers
Western cloud providers are cheap and reliable. Sadly,
this results in their infrastructure being a favorite place
for threat actors to host their botnet C&Cs.
Many western network brands appeared in last quarter’s
Top 20 including; Amazon (#3), DigitalOcean (#4),
Hetzner (#6), OVH (#7), Microsoft (#13), Leaseweb (#14)
and ColoCrossing (#17).
We believe these operators should set an example across
the industry in preventing malicious customers from
signing up to host botnet C&Cs on their networks.

Delis LLC - a new bulletproof hoster in town?
One of our newcomers in Q3 was the Dutch hosting
provider delis.one. Their website address doesn’t even
serve up a functioning website, which immediately raises
a red flag. Therefore, it will come as no surprise that they
entered the Top 20 at #5. Have we sniffed out a new
bulletproof hosting company? We are sure that time will
reveal all.

Networks hosting the most active
botnet C&Cs, Q3 2022
Finally, let’s review the networks that hosted the largest
number of active botnet C&Cs at the end of Q3 2022.
Hosting providers in this ranking either have an abuse
problem, do not take the appropriate action when
receiving abuse reports, or omit to notify us when they
have dealt with an abuse problem.

Chinese cloud providers leading this ranking (too)
Given the amount of newly observed botnet C&Cs hosted
in China in Q3, it is not a big surprise that China is leading
this ranking too. Tencent and Alibaba were hosting the
most active botnet C&Cs by the end of Q3.

We are delighted to see that the number of active
botnet C&Cs has improved at both Microsoft (Azure)
and Cloudflare. Both dramatically decreased botnet C&C
numbers hosted on their services by -80% (Microsoft) and
-58% (Cloudflare). Well done, and keep up the great work
on dealing with abuse reports quickly and effectively!
