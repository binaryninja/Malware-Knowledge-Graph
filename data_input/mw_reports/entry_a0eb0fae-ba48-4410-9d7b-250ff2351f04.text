Security Brief: TA544 Targets Italian Organizations with Ursnif Malware

2/6

September 29, 2021 Selena Larson and Proofpoint Staff
Proofpoint threat researchers identified an increase in targeted threats impacting Italian
organizations in 2021. This spike in observed threats is largely driven by a group called
TA544 leveraging the Ursnif banking trojan. Proofpoint has observed nearly 20 notable
campaigns distributing hundreds of thousands of messages targeting organizations in Italy
so far this year, which equals 80% of the total number of similar campaigns in the entirety of
2020. As many as 2,000 organizations were targeted in each of the Italian-language
campaigns.
TA544 is a cybercriminal threat actor that distributes banking malware and other payloads in
various geographic regions including Italy and Japan. Proofpoint has tracked this actor since
2017. Typically, this group varies its payloads which appear to be targeted by region – for
example, in 2021, all TA544 Ursnif campaigns have specifically targeted Italian organizations
while Dridex payloads associated with this threat actor do not have specific geographic
targeting.
Ursnif is a trojan that can be used to steal data from websites, with the help of web
injections, proxies and VNC connections; steal data such as stored passwords; and
download updates, modules, or other malware. Although this malware is used by multiple
cybercriminal threat actors, TA544’s activity targeting Italy differentiates it from other actors.
Between January and August 2021, the number of observed Ursnif campaigns impacting
Italian organizations surpassed the total number of observed Ursnif campaigns targeting this
region in all of 2020.
Campaign Details
In recently observed campaigns, TA544 purports to be Italian courier or energy organizations
soliciting payments from the targeted individual.

Attached to the emails are malicious Microsoft Office documents containing macros. If the
macros are enabled, the document will download Ursnif malware.

In the observed campaigns, TA544 often uses geofencing techniques to detect whether
recipients are in targeted geographic regions before infecting them with the malware. For
example, in recent campaigns, the document macro generates and executes an Excel 4
macro written in Italian, and the malware conducts location checks on the server side via IP
address. If the user was not in the target area, the malware command and control would
redirect to an adult website. So far in 2021, Proofpoint has observed nearly half a million
messages associated with this threat targeting Italian organizations.
According to Proofpoint data, Ursnif is currently the most frequently observed malware
targeting Italian organizations based on campaign data. Earlier this year, Proofpoint
researchers observed multiple Emotet campaigns targeting the region as well – however,
following the disruption of the Emotet botnet in January 2021, all Emotet activity has
disappeared and this malware is no longer an ongoing threat. Credential phishing is also a
frequently observed threat targeting Italian organizations, and threat actors have attempted
to steal credentials relating to logistics or banking services, for example.
Web Injects
Recent TA544 Ursnif campaigns included activity that targeted multiple sites with web injects
and redirections once the Ursnif payload was installed on the target machine. Web injects
refer to malicious code injected to a user’s web browser that attempts to steal data from
certain targeted websites. The list included dozens of targeted sites. For example, the list of
impacted sites includes login portals related to:

UniCredit Group
Agenziabpb
ING
BNL
Ebay
Amazon
Paypal
Banca Sella
CheBanca!
IBK
The identified web injects are designed to steal credentials from a wide variety of sites and
services likely to be used by Italian users. Although Ursnif has previously leveraged web
inject capability to infect targeted users. This indicates TA544 is not interested exclusively in
obtaining banking credentials, but also usernames and passwords affiliated with websites
associated with major retailers.
Conclusion
Today’s threats – like TA544’s campaigns targeting Italian organizations – target people, not
infrastructure. That’s why you must take a people-centric approach to cybersecurity. That
includes user-level visibility into vulnerability, attacks and privilege and tailored controls that
account for individual user risk.
Here’s what we recommend as a starting point.
Train users to spot and report malicious email. Regular training and simulated attacks
can stop many attacks and help identify people who are especially vulnerable. The best
simulations mimic real-world attack techniques. Look for solutions that tie into realworld attack trends and the latest threat intelligence.
Threat actors frequently distribute documents that require macros to be enabled to
deploy the malicious payload. Ensure macros are disabled for all employees and
include macro-laden attack simulations in security training demonstrations.
At the same time, assume that users will eventually click some threats. Attackers will
always find new ways to exploit human nature. Find a solution that spots and blocks
inbound email threats targeting employees before they reach the inbox. Invest in a
solution can manage the entire spectrum of email threats, not just malware-based
threats. Some threats—including business email compromise (BEC) and other forms of
email fraud—can be hard to detect with conventional security tools. Your solution
should analyze both external and internal email—attackers may use compromised
accounts to trick users within the same organization. Web isolation can be a critical
safeguard for unknows and risky URLs.
