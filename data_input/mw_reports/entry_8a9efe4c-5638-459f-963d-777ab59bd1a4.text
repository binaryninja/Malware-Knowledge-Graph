Foreword
Ransomware attacks commanded headlines around the world in 2021, and show no
signs of slowing down. In fact, cybercriminals are doubling down by finding additional
ways to extort victims in conjunction with ransomware. Double extortion first took off in
2020 with the rise of dark web leak sites that cybercriminals used to identify ransomware
victims and threaten to leak sensitive corporate data. In 2021, ransomware gangs took
these tactics to a new level, popularizing multi-extortion techniques designed to heighten
the cost and immediacy of the threat. For example, we’ve seen gangs make threatening
phone calls to employees and customers and launch denial of service (DoS) attacks to
shut down a victim’s website in an effort to incentivize payments.
In 2021, we also saw ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operators grow. RaaS operators
offer a wide array of easy-to-use tools and services that make launching ransomware
attacks almost as simple as using an online auction site. These operators have been
making investments during these past few years to optimize their businesses – they have
perfected their malware, developed marketing strategies to recruit more affiliates, and
even built up technical support operations to help victims get back online once they pay
their ransoms.
All these innovations have made it harder for organizations to defend against
ransomware, forcing some to make the hefty sorts of payments that are documented in
this report. The average ransom demand on cases worked by Unit 42 consultants last year
climbed 144% to $2.2 million, while the average payment rose 78% percent to $541,010.
As these ransomware gangs and RaaS operators find new ways to remove technical
barriers and up the ante, ransomware will continue to challenge organizations of all sizes
in 2022. As a result, ransomware has become one of the top threats in cybersecurity and a
focus area for Palo Alto Networks. This report provides the latest insights on established
and emerging ransomware groups, payment trends, and security best practices. I hope
these insights will help you better understand and manage the threat to your organization.

Executive Summary
Ransomware was a headliner in 2021, with a series of high-profile attacks
disrupting businesses, governments and schools around the globe. The attacks
interfered with a number of everyday activities people take for granted: seeing
a doctor, getting gas, buying groceries, watching the local news on TV, paying
bills, booking travel, and even calling for emergency assistance.
Unit 42 has compiled the 2022 Ransomware Threat Report to help put all this
ransomware activity into context and offer a better understanding of the scope
of the ransomware landscape and where it is headed. To generate the report,
our researchers and security consultants pulled data from two sources:
1.

The cases handled by Unit 42, which provide an on-the-ground
view of the diverse range of threat actors out there.

2. The analysis of leak sites, where ransomware operators provide
snippets of stolen information as part of their name-and-shame
(multi-extortion) tactics designed to coerce victims to pay
ransom demands, as well as general underground forums where
cybercriminals discuss the tools of their trade.

One key takeaway is that ransoms keep rising – both demands and payments.
Among our incident response cases in 2021, which were predominantly in the U.S.,
the average ransom demanded was approximately $2.2 million. This represents
about a 144% increase from the average demand of $900,000 from the cases our
consultants handled in 2020. The average payment in cases worked by Unit 42
consultants climbed to $541,010, which is 78% higher than the previous year.

Ransomware 101
Ransomware comes in many varieties.
Different ransomware groups are known for the types of attacks they launch – the
files, methods, tactics, and notes they use – and the targets they go after. Recent
headlines have been dominated by ransomware gangs such as Conti and REvil. These
groups actively recruit affiliates (cybercriminals) to carry out their attacks. Sometimes,
ransomware groups maintain an online presence, such as a leak site, “support” site,
and/or social media profile to help them with their affiliate recruitment and overall
success rates.

Ransomware is a type of malware used by cybercriminals for financial
gain. It is delivered in the same way any type of malware makes its
way onto victim systems. For example, attackers will exploit known
vulnerabilities, take advantage of systems that have already been
compromised, and/or use social engineering tactics, such as phishing
emails that attempt to trick users into downloading infected files or
clicking on malicious links, to get a foothold into an organization that they
can use to carry out their attack.

Once in, the ransomware will take over the victim’s files or systems and
encrypt key information to render it unusable to the organization.
The attacker will demand a ransom be paid in exchange for a decryption
key, which will presumably return the files to their original state.

The Ransomware
Landscape
After analyzing ransomware activity in 2021 and comparing it to the activity of the past
several years, we have seen some recurring techniques and tactics that attackers rely
on, as well as some emerging trends that are shaping the ransomware landscape. The
following are the observations that you need to be mindful of — both old and new —
when building strategies to bolster your defense.

How Ransomware Actors Behave
Attackers Take Shortcuts
Using an initial access broker, who sells ready access to corporate networks
to anyone who will pay for it, is becoming standard for many ransomware
gangs. While many in the cybercrime world want this kind of access,
ransomware operators are particularly interested because it saves their
affiliates a lot of effort and time. The cooperation is very profitable for both
the ransomware operators and the access brokers. It also enables less
sophisticated threat actors, who lack the skills to find an unobtrusive way
into a network, to quickly and easily carry out attacks by simply dropping
ransomware into an already compromised environment. Organizations
should remain vigilant and do all they can to uncover attackers hiding in their
environment, looking for lateral movement and dormant executable files that
could indicate the presence of an attack foothold.

Attackers Will Use Any Tricks They Can
Attackers are increasingly using anonymized services, which makes it more
difficult for security researchers and law enforcement to track activities
and identify indicators of compromise (IoCs) that can be used for network
defenses. Tor, short for The Onion Router, and other anonymous services are
very popular with ransomware groups and will likely continue to be a critical part
of their tactics to make it as hard as possible to defend against their attacks.

2022 Ransomware Threat Report

02 | THE RANSOMWARE LANDSCAPE

Attackers Are Innovative
Ransomware threat actors continue to invest in their own tooling to
keep compromising victims, developing new and updated ransomware
variants for use as standalone malware or alongside commodity
malware. More ransomware groups are developing variants to target
additional operating systems, such as Linux (e.g., HelloKitty), or
leveraging highly customizable programming languages, such as Rust
(e.g., BlackCat), to create attacks more easily. It is clear that adversaries
will continue to create new variants and build out their capabilities
to target all kinds of systems, which will widen the scope of possible
victims in the process. Organizations need to do the same with defenses,
adapting and adding capabilities to minimize the attack surface.

Three Ransomware Trends to Know for 2022

1

Victim Shaming Is on the Rise
Increasingly, ransomware gangs are using multi-extortion techniques in
an effort to strong arm the victim organization to pay the ransom demand.
They not only encrypt an organization’s files, but also leverage leak sites
and threaten follow-on attacks (e.g., DDoS) to incentivize a swift payout.

35
NEW
RANSOMWARE
GANGS IN 2021

Releasing samples of the victim’s stolen/compromised data on the dark
web or their gang’s leak site is a way for the perpetrator to prove they have
the information and the threat is serious – they may even include details
on the total amount of data they have – to name and shame the victims
into payment. These tactics prevent offline backups from stopping all the
negative effects of a ransomware attack.

VICTIMS PUBLICLY

Multi-extortion techniques were less than a year old heading into 2020,
but exploded in popularity last year. At least 35 new ransomware gangs,
such as Black Matter, Hive, and Grief emerged and threatened to expose
data or utilized leak sites in 2021. Suncrypt and a new player, BlackCat,
began executing triple extortion attacks, siphoning a victim’s data
before deploying their ransomware and then threatening to release the
information and launch a DDoS attack if the ransom was not paid. In 2021,

While there is some reliance on older, unpatched vulnerabilities, we believe threat actors are increasingly
tracking high-profile vulnerabilities and exploiting them to gain an initial foothold in an organization.
The timeframe from vulnerability to exploit is getting shorter – it can practically coincide with the reveal
if the vulnerabilities themselves and the access that can be achieved by exploiting them are significant
enough. We saw this with Hafnium’s advanced persistent threat against Microsoft Exchange Server
vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858, and CVE-2021-27065), where
various attacks were launched by multiple threat groups to capitalize on vulnerable systems.

Another example came at the beginning of September when Conti used CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523, and
CVE-2021-31207 (ProxyShell) in their ransomware attacks and then, in December, started exploiting the recent
vulnerability CVE-2021-44228, known as Log4Shell, as a way to gain entry to victims as well as to move laterally
across internal devices.

As long as vulnerabilities are available (unpatched), attackers will take advantage of them to
further their objectives. It’s important to keep in mind that attackers may also take advantage of
vulnerabilities in third-party software or attack supply chain elements, which can introduce risks
for many organizations down the line. We saw this with REvil in the Kaseya attacks.
Organizations may have previously grown used to taking time between the disclosure of a
vulnerability and patching it, but while it’s still necessary to perform due diligence on a patch,
attackers’ ability to scan the internet in search of vulnerable systems means it’s more important
than ever to shorten the time it takes to patch. Organizations need to ramp up patch management
and orchestration to try to close these known holes as soon as possible.

Conti
As noted, Conti was the most active ransomware group among the incidents
handled by Unit 42 in 2021. They impacted large victims asking for very high
ransom demands. We first observed them in March with an initial ransom
amount of $50,000. This was the lowest request reported during the year
for this group. They quickly and significantly increased their demands,
averaging around $1.78 million for the year – their top initial payment request
was $3 million. Given their initial (only observed) ransom demand in 2020
was $187,114, it is fair to say they have been quickly growing in numbers and
confidence.
Conti stands out as one of the most ruthless ransomware gangs since their
emergence in 2020. They operate without a “code of honor” that some other
threat actors claim to observe when it comes to targeting vital or particularly
vulnerable victims. Conti carries out attacks against hospitals, emergency
services, and law enforcement agencies, using double extortion techniques
to shame victims into paying a ransom. From leak site data, which includes
victims beyond those handled by our incident response team, we found that
Conti has leaked the information of more than 600 organizations since 2020.

REvil - also known as Sodinokibi
REvil/Sodinokibi was the second most active ransomware group during 2021,
dropping slightly from being the most active in 2020. From our 2021 incident
response data, they averaged an initial ransom demand of approximately $2.2
million. This was significantly higher than what was observed during 2020, when
their average ransom demand was $488,928.52. In 2020, their top initial ransom
demand was $3 million; in 2021 their highest demand was $5.4 million.
The operator behind this ransomware, PINCHY SPIDER, switched its GandCrab
operations to REvil/Sodinokibi in mid-2019. This was probably due to recent arrests
of affiliates suspected of about 7,000 infections. The switch, however, did nothing
to lower their profile; in fact, thanks to the Kaseya VSA and other big headline
attacks, they are one of the world’s most notorious ransomware operators.

REvil/Sodinokibi is also one of the most prominent providers of RaaS, taking a
percentage of the negotiated ransom price as their fee. The size of specific ransoms
depended on the size of the organization and type of data stolen. Further, when victims
failed to meet deadlines for making payments via Bitcoin, the attackers often doubled the
demand. Eventually, they posted stolen data on leak sites if the victim didn’t pay up or
enter into negotiations.

BlackCat
BlackCat (aka ALPHV) is notable because of the group’s meteoric rise – just
one month after surfacing, in November 2021, BlackCat had the seventh-largest
number of victims listed on their leak site among ransomware groups tracked
by Unit 42. Operating a RaaS business model, BlackCat was observed soliciting
affiliates in known cybercrime forums. They offered to allow affiliates to leverage
the ransomware and keep 80-90% of the ransom payment, paying the remaining
10-20% to the BlackCat author. The largest number of the group’s victims so far are
U.S. organizations, but BlackCat and its affiliates have also attacked organizations
in Europe, the Philippines, and other locations. Victims include organizations in the
following sectors: construction and engineering, retail, transportation, commercial
services, insurance, machinery, professional services, telecommunication, auto
components, and pharmaceuticals.

BlackCat ransomware is one of the first, if not the first, to be coded in the Rust
programming language (though other malware has used Rust). Rust has numerous
native options and is highly customizable, which makes it easier for malware authors to
pivot and individualize attacks. By leveraging this programming language, ransomware
attacks can be easily compiled against various operating system architectures, which
could account for BlackCat’s fast, prolific nature.

AvosLocker
AvosLocker is RaaS that started operations in late June, using a blue
beetle logo to identify itself in communications with victims and “press
releases” aimed at recruiting new affiliates. AvosLocker was observed
promoting its RaaS program and looking for affiliates on dark web
discussion forums and other forums. Like many of its competitors,
AvosLocker offers technical support to help victims recover after being
attacked with encryption software that the group claims is “fail-proof,”
has low detection rates, and is capable of handling large files. This
ransomware also has an extortion site, which claims to have impacted six
organizations in the following countries: the U.S., the U.K., the U.A.E.,
Belgium, Spain, and Lebanon.

Hive Ransomware is double-extortion ransomware that started
operations in June. Since then, Hive has impacted 66 organizations that
are now listed on the group’s extortion site, including a European airline
company and three U.S.-based organizations. Hive uses all tools available
in the extortion tool set to create pressure on the victim, including
publishing the date of initial compromise, a countdown, the date the leak
was actually disclosed on their site, and even providing the option for
visitors to the leak site to share the disclosed leak on social media.

HelloKitty
HelloKitty is not a new ransomware group – it can be traced back to
2020, when it mainly targeted Windows systems. However, in July,
we observed a Linux variant of HelloKitty targeting VMware’s ESXi
hypervisor, which is widely used in cloud and on-premises data centers.
We also observed two clusters of activity. Across the observed samples,
some threat actors preferred to communicate with victims via email, while
others used the peer-to-peer anonymous instant messenger service,
TorChats. The observed variants impacted five organizations in Italy,
Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, and the U.S.

LockBit 2.0
LockBit 2.0 (previously known as ABCD ransomware) changed their
name to LockBit in July 2021 and launched a slick marketing campaign to
recruit new affiliates. It appeared to work, since the three-year-old RaaS
operator was linked to some high-profile attacks in 2021 across multiple
industries. Their success prompted the Federal Bureau of Investigation
to publish a warning on them in early 2022. The group claims to offer
the fastest encryption on the ransomware market. To date, there are
406 victims listed on the group’s leak site, including organizations in the
U.S., Mexico, Belgium, Argentina, Malaysia, Australia, Brazil, Switzerland,
Germany, Italy, Austria, Romania, and the U.K.

Mespinoza
Mespinoza was observed targeting real estate, manufacturing, and
education organizations. Through research and analysis, Unit 42
researchers have concluded that Mespinoza has a large global reach,
with victims in the U.S., Canada, South America, Europe, South Africa,
and Australia. Mespinoza uses the remote desktop protocol as an initial
intrusion vector and exfiltrates files for exposure on leak sites.

eCh0raix
eCh0raix has been active for about a year targeting Synology networkattached storage (NAS) and Quality Network Appliance Provider (QNAP)
NAS devices used in small offices and home offices (SOHOs). To date,
the attacks have resulted in modest payouts. SOHO users are attractive
to ransomware operators because they typically don’t employ dedicated
IT or security professionals, which makes them less prepared to
block ransomware attacks. They also offer a potential way into larger
enterprises, if attackers can use the SOHO NAS devices as a stepping
stone of supply chain attacks on an enterprise.

Initial Ransom Amount versus Payment Amount
While many ransomware families made ransom demands that were substantial, for
the most part, actual payments in incident response cases we handled tended to
be less significant. There are always outliers, such as BlackCat getting one payout
of $8.5 million, which was pretty close to the initial $9 million demand, but the
majority of payments ended up being significantly less than initial demands.
For instance, in one case, Suncrypt received a final payout of $200,000, which
was 1.67% of the initial demand of $12 million. From a case by case viewpoint, we
calculated that victims on average paid 42.87% of the initial ransom amount. Figure
8 shows the difference between actual ransom payouts and initial ransom demands
for those incidents where the ransomware gang wanted $3 million or more and the
victim chose to pay the ransom. With one exception, all payouts in the graph were
at least 50% less than the demand, which indicates just how much room there is for
negotiation when a victim is attacked.

The Rise of Double (and Multi) Extortion Techniques
Maze popularized the double extortion tactic in 2019, laying the path for future
ransomware operators. With double extortion techniques, adversaries demand a
ransom and then inform victims that they will publicly expose the stolen data if the
ransom is not paid, presumably to incentivize swift payment in full. In 2021, we
observed 35 new groups emerge using the same extortion model.
We also started to see ransomware groups apply triple extortion techniques.
Suncrypt, originally seen in October 2019, was one of the first, along with BlackCat,
to apply these triple extortion tactics. This means that, along with data encryption

Sectors and Industries Most Heavily Targeted
Based on ransomware leak site data, the Professional and Legal Services industry
was the most targeted by ransomware breaches in 2021, with more than 1,100
victims listed on various sites. Following this sector was the Construction industry,
which included more than 600 victims.
These organizations may be prone to cyberattacks because they often run on
systems with out-of-date software that isn’t easily or regularly updated/patched –
ransomware operators can take advantage of these old vulnerabilities to initiate their
exploits. Add in the rapid adoption of IoT, and attackers have a rapidly expanding
attack surface through which they can deploy their ransomware (e.g., WannaCry).
Another reason these industries could be a popular target is that attackers know if
the victim’s operations are disrupted, it means they can’t provide their products or
services. Many organizations within these sectors use their own technologies to
provide their services, if impacted by a ransomware attack, productivity stops and
processes slow down, which could impact business and generate significant costs
and damages. Ransomware groups hope the pressure these organizations are under
to meet deadlines and produce deliverables will lead them to quickly pay in full, so
they can get back up and running as fast as possible.

The Ebbs and Flows of Ransomware Gangs
The activity of individual ransomware groups tends to go up and down – a group
that’s prominent and active one month may seem to disappear altogether the next
month. These ransomware groups shut down or go quiet for various reasons. For
instance, they may be under pressure or scrutiny from law enforcement, sorting out
internal struggles (between operators and affiliates), or dealing with competition
(e.g., a new RaaS with better rates that incentivize affiliates to switch).
Sometimes a group may simply rebrand or re-launch their product.
Operators need people (affiliates) who are willing to use their
ransomware – if they can’t sell it, they may try to retool and rebrand. One
interesting use case is the critical flaw that Emsisoft researchers found
in DarkSide and BlackMatter ransomware, which enabled victims to
decrypt and recover their files without having to pay a ransom. This cost
the ransomware groups millions of dollars in ransom payments and is
likely related to why they went offline. It is presumed they went quietly
to work on a better version (it’s suspected they are the BlackCat group,
which suddenly came on the scene and made waves in November 2021,
but Unit 42 researchers have not yet confirmed this).

Examples of some swings in ransomware group activity seen in 2021:
•

LockBit successfully pulled off a rebrand last year with their launch of LockBit 2.0.
After their initial debut in July 2021 they added victims at a very stable rate for a few
months, peaking in September 2021.

•

Avaddon decreased submissions to their sites in early June, and then halted
operations altogether mid-June, when they released decryption keys for all of their
2,934 victims. (It’s worth noting that this activity shows how challenging it is to get
visibility into ransomware operations – their site only had 180 victims publicly listed.)

•

REvil/Sodinokibi activity was noticeable throughout the year, but due to their attack
against Kaseya, they stopped submitting victims after July 2021. The group reemerged in September as displayed on the chart, but went back to being offline for
the remainder of the year, most likely as a result of law enforcement action against
the group.

•

Pysa re-emerged at the end of the year with lots of activity, after no activity during
the summer of 2021.

•

November was a very active month for Conti, LockBit 2.0, and Pysa, with more than 30
submissions into their respective leaksites.

Ransomware in
Cloud Environments
In general, we believe public clouds that follow cloud security best practices have the
potential to be more resilient to ransomware than on-premises environments. The shared
responsibility model significantly reduces the burden on any one organization to secure
infrastructure, platform, and software. API-driven cloud services make monitoring,
automation, and centralized access control easier, and cloud-native backup services
provide reliable ways to recover cloud resources. Nevertheless, it is an organization’s
responsibility to securely configure, operate, and monitor cloud workloads.
As the IT infrastructure grows with the business, securing thousands of
dynamic workloads in a multi-cloud and hybrid cloud environment can be
challenging. However, DevOps security automation practices allow IT and
security teams to maintain security over highly dynamic environments.
Given the amount of valuable data in the cloud, it is only a matter of time before we see
ransomware groups target cloud environments. However, to launch ransomware attacks
in cloud environments, threat actors will likely use new TTPs, which means organizations
will need to be prepared to adjust their defensive approaches in turn.

Hardening Cloud Workloads
from the Image Down
The Log4J vulnerabilities highlight the need for a good vulnerability management program
and compensating controls where updates aren’t possible. A majority of attacks on cloud
workloads are known vulnerabilities. That’s why it’s critical to ensure that vulnerabilities
are patched and misconfigurations, like privileged containers, are remediated before
and through runtime. For zero-days and unpatchable workloads, it’s necessary to have
compensating controls in place, such as virtual patching and anomolous process, network,
and file access. Cloud resource segmentation via tightly controlled IAM policies can also help
ensure that if a workload is compromised, the infection is contained to a single or at least
small number of workloads.

2022 Ransomware Threat Report

05 | RANSOMWARE IN CLOUD ENVIRONMENTS

Securing Cloud APIs through IAM Best Practices
Threat actors seeking to deploy ransomware in the cloud will not be able to simply
infect more hosts and encrypt the files they find there. Instead, they will use cloud
APIs to access and encrypt data, which means that organizations will need to
secure access to those APIs.
This is one of the ways that following cloud security best practices is key. All API
communications require identity and access management (IAM) access keys and
sufficient permissions for the cloud resource the user is trying to interact with.
Threat actors seeking to abuse cloud APIs would have to steal access keys and then
test their permissions, which means that organizations can defend against this type
of attack by closely monitoring IAM permissions. First, organizations should check
for misconfigurations, overly broad permissions, and other weaknesses in IAM
access. Next, organizations should institute procedures to identify exposed IAM
access keys and continuously monitor IAM access keys to cloud resources.

Threat Actors Face Barriers in the Cloud, Which Buys
Time for Organizations to Prepare Now
For now, various barriers will likely slow threat actors seeking to attack
organizations through the cloud. The supported APIs for each cloud service are
different, and each cloud service provider offers a number of different data storage
services. This doesn’t mean organizations should assume they’re immune to
ransomware in the cloud. The time to institute best practices, especially regarding
identity and access management, is now, so those protections are in place before
threat actors focus their efforts on deploying ransomware in this manner.
This can include the use of a Cloud Security Posture Management tool to help
ensure the deployment of proper compliance frameworks and perform valid asset
control over cloud environments. A Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management
tool can assist with IAM security monitoring. Other tools such as Cloud Code
Security and Cloud Workload Protection can be configured automatically to ensure
that security teams can scale as the cloud scales.

Costs of Ransomware
As ransomware gangs become bolder, they are having a bigger impact on
the organizations they target. While it is generally advised not to pay the
ransom, the prolonged effects of a shutdown can force organizations to
consider other options to restore operations.
The long-term effects of a ransomware attack can pose a substantial
challenge for organizations. A Canadian study found that of the businesses
hit by ransomware, a majority (58%) of IT decision-makers say their
organization paid the ransom, with 14% saying their organization paid more
than once.

In addition to the ransom—whether or not the organization decides to pay

inflicted by an attack:

To minimize the impact of a successful attack or, ideally,

both backup systems and proactive defenses are in place to
accelerate an organization’s recovery.

Conclusion and
Recommendations
As ransomware actor activity continues to rise worldwide, preparation is key to
thwarting attacks. Because double extortion and leak sites are the new normal for
emerging ransomware families, the ante has been raised – it’s no longer just access
to data that’s at stake, as significant as that can be, but also a victim’s reputation
and the trust a customer has in an organization that is on the line. While maintaining
good cyber hygiene and implementing security awareness training is a foundational
starting point, Unit 42 makes the following recommendations to help you become
more resilient against ransomware.

1

Stay Up to Date on the Evolving Threat Landscape
The ransomware threat landscape will undoubtedly continue to evolve,
as threat actors leverage new creative techniques to stifle business
operations. Keep your security team and key executive stakeholders
better informed of the current state of ransomware threats, their potential
impact to your business, and actionable steps your organization can take to
prevent attacks. This means educating your key C-level stakeholders and
the board by speaking the language of the business and leveraging threat
briefings to strategically inform your risk profile and security strategy. You
must also educate your technical security team on the latest ransomware
threats, including attack vectors, TTPs, ransom demands, and top
safeguards to prevent attacks.

2

Analyze the Business Impact of Losing Critical Data
To understand the impact of losing access to critical data, you must first
gain full visibility into your assets and understand where critical data
lives, how it’s accessed, and how it’s used across your organization. We
recommend completing a data mapping exercise, ensuring that access
to confidential information is on a need-to-know basis. Next, conduct

2022 Ransomware Threat Report

32

07 | CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

a business impact analysis to fully understand the risks associated with
not having access to that data – both from an upstream and downstream
perspective. For example, if you’re a retail organization, what is the
downtime that is going to occur at your headquarters, in your stores, and
in the supply chain if your point-of-sale system is down and you can’t do
manual processing?

3

Assess Internal and External Readiness
You run the increased risk of a successful – and highly damaging –
ransomware attack if you don’t consistently assess your security posture.
Assess the most significant ransomware risks ahead of you within the
context of your unique combination of people, processes, technology, and
governance capabilities. You will also need to look across the business
to identify any third-party elements, partner elements, or supply chain
elements that could introduce risks. With this knowledge, you can
establish a prioritized mitigation roadmap detailing the requirements to
reach your organization’s security goals aligned with strategic business
objectives.

4

Review and Test Your Incident Response Plan
Pressure test and update your incident response plan on a regular basis
leveraging the latest ransomware threat intelligence to conduct tabletop
exercises and purple team testing simulations. By conducting mock
incident response walkthroughs, you can measure your ability to respond
to a ransomware attack before it happens and evaluate your ability
to counter the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by common
ransomware groups. These types of exercises can help you identify gaps
and areas for improvement to help bolster your readiness and strengthen
your overall cyber defense capabilities to combat ransomware.
As a part of these exercises, leaders should ensure that decision trees
are formally defined and socialized with key stakeholders to facilitate
discussion and buy-in. When a change in stakeholder personnel occurs,
these decision trees should be revisited and updated as required. Having
the tough conversations before an incident occurs will save valuable time

2022 Ransomware Threat Report

33

07 | CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

and enable organizations to focus on what matters most – maintaining
critical operations and recovering to a state of normalcy.
• Under what circumstances would you pay a ransom?
• How would you maintain customer trust if the media was swirling with
rumors and your stock price was sinking?
• What would happen if your CISO was incapacitated when an incident
was discovered?
• Who would you call to stop an active incident from spreading like
wildfire?

5

Implement Zero Trust
Zero Trust, a strategic approach to cybersecurity to secure an organization,
eliminates implicit trust and continuously validates every stage of digital
interaction. The Zero Trust Model has become increasingly top of mind
for executives who need to keep up with digital transformation and adapt
to the ever-changing security landscape. Many organizations still struggle
with a poorly integrated, loose assembly of point products that do not
align with the strategic approach expected by board members and C-level
executives. Deployed properly, Zero Trust simplifies and unifies risk
management by making security one use case across users, device, source
of connection, or access method.

6

Identify Your Exposed Assets
Implement a system of record to track every asset, system, and service
you own that is on the public internet. This includes tracking across all
major cloud service providers and dynamically leased (commercial and
residential) Internet Service Provider (ISP) space, using comprehensive
indexing and spanning common, and often misconfigured, port/protocols
(i.e., not limited to the old perspective of only tracking HTTP and HTTPS
websites). For example, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is the most
popular initial ransomware attack vector, accounting for the majority of
ransomware infections, since attackers can easily uncover this protocol
thanks to working from home now being a common norm. M&A, supply
chain, and IoT also bypass change controls, making them another popular
vector. M&A activity, for example, has reached an all-time high during the
COVID-19 pandemic, changing the face of networks almost overnight.

2022 Ransomware Threat Report

34

07 | CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

While security teams are doing a good job, it’s no longer sufficient to
protect a static IP address – infrastructure changes quickly.
An attack surface management (ASM) platform can provide a complete
and accurate inventory of an organization’s global internet-facing assets
and misconfigurations to continuously discover, evaluate, and mitigate
security issues on an external attack surface, flag risky communications,
evaluate supplier risk, find RDP instances, or assess the security of
acquired companies.

7

Prevent Known and Unknown Threats
To prevent known threats, you need to stop known exploits, malware, and
command-and-control traffic from entering your network. Once those have
been stopped, the cost of executing an attack rises and, subsequently,
reduces its likelihood, by forcing attackers to create new malware variants
and launch new exploits against lesser-known vulnerabilities.
You also need to prevent users from inadvertently downloading a malicious
payload or having their credentials stolen by preventing access to known
malicious and phishing URLs. Blocking these threats removes them from
the equation entirely. Once these known threats have been blocked, you
need to scan for known malware on your SaaS-based applications, as they
are increasingly leveraged to deliver threats. Any identified malware and
exploits from the scan should be blocked. The same should be done for
known malware and exploits on the endpoint.
Once the known threats have been blocked, it is imperative to identify and
block any unknown threats, as attackers continue to deploy new zeroday exploits and develop new ransomware variants. Identify all traffic on
the network and block unknown, potentially high-risk traffic (e.g. macros
downloaded from the internet) at the edge, ensuring you have coverage of
web and non-web traffic. Next, detect unknown threats in files and URLs.
As new files are submitted, it is essential to detonate, analyze, and look for
malicious behavior.
Additionally, you need to automatically push the protections to different
parts of the security infrastructure as fast as possible in order to prevent
threats from becoming successful. These protections should include an

2022 Ransomware Threat Report

35

07 | CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

understanding of the context of the attacker, malware, campaign, and IoCs
associated with the attack. Once unknown threats or trends of suspicious
behavior have been identified and blocked, block unknown malware and
exploits on the endpoint to ensure that all access points are secure.
The ultimate goal of this process is to turn the unknown into the known
and improve the security posture with new protections at a faster pace
than attackers can develop their malware and exploits – across the entire
attack lifecycle.

8

Automate Where Possible
Consider implementing tools that support the automated remediation of
events that leverage pre-made playbooks to respond and recover from
incidents. Incident response (IR), SecOps, and threat intelligence teams
can save many hours of manual labor trying to piece disparate sources
of information together from multiple tools. Security orchestration,
automation, and response (SOAR) products can automate the whole
process of user investigation, endpoint isolation, notifications,
enrichment, and threat hunting by orchestrating across security
information and event management (SIEM), firewalls, endpoint security,
and threat intelligence sources so that response teams can quickly shut
down the ransomware, minimize the risk of losing data, and limit the
financial impact of ransom demands.

Secure Cloud Workloads
Securing cloud workloads for ransomware defense begins with a secure
posture. Ensure that all cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes, and container
images are securely configured and steps have been taken to minimize
vulnerabilities. Check that standard policies, like encryption, MFA delete,
versioning, and backups that are built into cloud provider offerings, but
off by default, are turned on and properly configured. Check open source
packages and libraries for vulnerabilities that can be patched. Identify
and remove overly permissive or unused IAM entitlements. This is best
checked throughout the development lifecycle, making sure the code is
secure before it turns into cloud applications and infrastructure. At runtime,
check for known bad and anomalous activities that indicate a compromise.

07 | CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Track and block bad behavior at a process, file, and network level. Isolate
services to just their intended dependencies and block lateral and external
access that isn’t required to operate. Blocking threat behaviors at all of
these levels creates a layered approach that maximizes security.

Reduce Response Time with Retainers
It’s critical to take swift action once a potential breach has been
identified. With an IR retainer in place, you can make IR experts an
extension of your team, having them on speed dial whenever you require
assistance. You won’t engage in a frantic search for resources when
there is a problem – instead, you know the correct specialist will show up
within hours. And because IR consultants will already understand your
environment, they can respond faster and more accurately should an
incident occur. You won’t experience the anxiety of answering baseline
questions from uninformed third-party investigators when all you want
to do is get on with eliminating the problem. You’re able to create a
predictable incident response budget and take faster action to minimize
the impact of an attack.

Methodology
This report is based on data from multiple sources, both internal and
external. The objective is to expose threat actors, not their victims, so
all case data has been anonymized and only categorized by topics, such
as industry, geography, and attack vector. The source of specific data
referenced in the report is noted throughout.

Internal data for this report (referenced primarily in Section 2) was anonymized
information collected during security consulting and incident response
engagements from clients predominantly based in the U.S. One service that Unit 42
Security Consulting performs is ransomware negotiations on behalf of clients. For
the subset of clients who use this service and elect to pay the ransom, Unit 42 tracks
key information, including the ransomware variant, initial demand, amount paid,
and whether or not the threat actor provided the decryption utility upon payment
for the initially agreed-upon amount. Additional data for this report comes from
managed threat hunting, product security telemetry, and threat research organically
developed during the course of business.
External data (referenced primarily in Section 3) was collated and analyzed from
ransomware leak sites to identify ransomware families performing double extortion.
Most of the time these ransomware notes include onion links, which direct victims
to their site – these sites are hosted in a repository and monitored by the team to
understand their activity throughout the year. The majority of the sites are publicly
available and found on the “dark web,” which allows the team to scrape victim
names, dates, and the sites where the data is hosted. After the data is collected, it
is enriched by the team with the victim’s industry, sector, location, and any other
details that can be discerned.
We recently revised the methodology we use to calculate average ransom demands
and payments. As a result, we’re restating the 2020 average payment to $303,757
(from $312,493 published in the 2021 Ransomware Threat Report).
