October 19, 2020

NYANxCAT is a prolific hacker who programs new pieces and versions of malware, shares it widely, and

records blackhat hacker educational YouTube videos which has over 150,000 views. He uses GitHub repository, sells his hacker tools and
services using PayPal and Bitcoin. In this report, we discuss some of the samples of NYANXCat malware, his business models, and possible
Kuwaiti identity.

Details
NYANxCAT Possible Identity
NYANxCAT stays under the radar for Google/Youtube, PayPal, Github and other services, as he claims his blackhat hacking videos, tools, and
malware are only “for educational purposes.” At the same time, NYANxCAT hides his real-life identity behind aliases. During his recent hacker
career, he was also using semi-private tools such as Protonmail for communication and Bitcoin for donations and payments. Despite these
measures, Red Sky Alliance analysts were able to analyze NYANxCAT’s communications and identify a possible hint to his real identity:

Figure 2. NYANxCAT hacking video and a PayPal donation link
Some of the NYANxCat’s hacking videos had a Paypal donation link given via an URL shortener: bit[.]ly/2B07Jaa (Figure 2).[1] This link is
connected to Paypal hosted button id UEAXKSXDFJ2X6 and exposes email address humooud.m@gmail.com (Figure 3).

Figure 3. NYANxCAT linked PayPal page exposes his personal Gmail address
Analysis of the past uses of humooud.m@gmail.com shows that this email was used in 2017 to register domain odin-samsung[.]com. These
records expose possible NYANxCAT identity as Hmoud Aljraid and his possible address in Jahra, Kuwait (Table 1).
Table 1. WHOIS historic record includes NYANxCAT’s email address
Domain Name:

odin-samsung[.]com

2/10

Time Period:

2017-02-09 – 2018-02-12

Registrant Name:

Hmoud Aljraid

Registrant Address:

ST 58 HOUSE# 8 Jahra KU 65852 KW

Registrant Phone:

965.9982545

Registrant Email:

humooud.m@gmail.com

Note that “Humooud” and “Hmoud” are likely the same Arabic name that could be written in English in more than two ways.
Additional research on humooud.m@gmail.com reveals that it is connected to Google User ID 106720573170316530671. That is listed as
Humoud Meshal and is active leaving Google reviews in the vicinity of Kuwait City in the last 3 years, and Sri Lanka 6 years ago (Figure 4).[2]

Figure 4. Humoud Meshal’s locations in Kuwait and Sri Lanka
Kuwaiti location matches cases when NYANxCAT actually put Kuwait as his country on his accounts (e.g. Github).[3] Past Sri Lankan location
matches the nature of his past domain registration activity (Table 1). Most of NYANxCAT persona content is in English, but he is still able to
have a conversation in Arabic as could be seen in some of his Youtube threads (Figure 5).

3/10

Figure 5. NYANxCAT is proficient in Arabic, Youtube comments
The search for Humoud Meshal’s user picture reveals connection to technical Arabic blog bomish3l[.]com. This blog references additional
Youtube “Bomish3l” and Twitter @HumoudMJ accounts (Figure 6).

Figure 6. Humoud’s photo on Twitter (left) and on his autotranslated blog (right)
Humoud’s Twitter account, @HumoudMJ follows a number of exploit-related accounts. He lists his name in Arabic, that autotranslates as
Hammoud Al-Jerid which matches the historic WHOIS record (Table 1).
Humoud’s Youtube account had videos on a couple of topics including Android and hacking, e.g. video, “Hacking devices in wireless networks
using your Android phone”.[4] It is interesting that that YouTube account was posting videos since 2013, last one was in 2017. But in 2018,
we see another YouTube channel becoming active: NYANxCAT.[5]
Humoud Meshal aka Humoud Aljraid uses aliases like HumoudMJ or hmj_7, so it is logical that Meshal is his middle name (M), while Aljraid/Al
Jerid is his last [J].[6]
As NYAnxCAT and Humoud accounts are connected via the used PayPal and Gmail accounts, Kuwaiti location, hacking interest, and
language capabilities, we assess with medium confidence that Humoud is the real NYANxCAT identity (see The NYANxCAT Hacker Profile
above).
From Donations to Services
NYANxCAT was trying to monetize his notoriety in various ways. He would often include donation links into his source code and educational
videos – often it was his Bitcoin addresses, sometimes PayPal donation link (see above, Figure 2,3).

4/10

Figure 7. NYANxCAT hacker shop at Sellix as of July 2020
NYANxCAT created a personal shop page at Sellix. Earlier this year, he was selling three items: his C# hacking tools and malware coding
services, his hacker tool Lime Crypter, and his malware Mass Logger (Figure 7). Later in October 2020, NYANxCAT removed the offer of the
programming services, leaving the malware and the hacking tool for sale.
NYANxCAT Samples
We analyze various malicious samples associated with NYANxCAT – mostly recent ones from September 2020. These samples cover different
stages of malicious attacks, some of them are source code and crypters used for weaponization – preparation of the attack. Some are the
delivery mechanism for later stage malware. Others are installation artifacts. See the brief description below and the Indicators table attached.
We also included some personal strings: emails, cryptocurrency addresses, aliases. Those are useful for the profile building, but they are also
helping find new samples in the wild as they often have strings with NYANcCAT aliases or his Github page. When listing indicators, we do not
include “NYAN CAT” alias as it brings some true positives, but also bring many false positive as it was an original popular meme name that
was adopted by this hacker.
LimeCrypter
NYANxCAT programmed and is promoting and distributing his hacker tool called LimeCrypter (also Lime-Crypter). One of the latest
LimeCrypter version seen in the wild is 2.0.7552.41963, executable sample hash:
f55a23559bb981f9a054297b003293b890b8caa2b7abccef9464b817787352a6.[7]
This hacker tool calls to NYANxCAT hidden paste on Pastebin for the list of recent upgrades and added features. It claims a first release date
of 18 July 2020, and the last update as of this writing, 8 October 2020.[8] NyanxCAT Github shows that he was working on the LimeCrypter
since at least August 2019, possibly since 2018.[9]

Figure 8. NYANxCAT’s Youtube video shows LimeCrypter made a malware undetectable
Since August 2020, NYANxCAT posted four videos explaining and promoting this hacker tool, showcasing how it helps to avoid antivirus
detections (Figure 8).[10]
RATs
AsyncRAT by NYANxCAT can often be seen among samples in the wild. Executable sample hash:

5/10

22096a0846ab1399647bb2cc5596c649fa6508d2bd09db05476b27acd9d4eea2.[11] Async RAT can be detected using Yara rule win_asyncrat
by Johannes Bader @viql.[12]
Archived sample containing another NYANxCAT-related RAT, Revenge-RAT v3, could be found using the following hash:
2cf26e5fe9f31386d57170cc51ec46d6e4b73e4760826d65ca1a7afc8c82acc2.[13]
Downloaders
A few small NYANxCAT related samples in the wild represent various downloaders (droppers). Those include JS Downloader, VBS Shell, and
a number of unidentified droppers (see Indicators Table attached below). A sample of JS Downloader code with payload URL could be found
using this hash:
5747ad762067a8a6617d2a4362304c24e11b21d6deed2da2adb31b8d55a4607c.[14]
Miners
Some of the NYANxCAT-related malware has cryptomining capabilities. One example is NYANxCAT-branded Lime Miner, executable sample
hash:
74de28d70ee4bd414597561b696f865cb3c88fd3626161d36c423d35154e11a5.[15] Another example is a case of AsyncRAT.exe with Monero
cryptocurrency mining capability (see Indicators below).
Modifications
It was also common for NYANxCAT to take an old piece of malicious code and to adapt/modify it for more malicious potential. Examples are
Revenge-RAT v0.3, Neshta 1.0 – modified and branded by NYANxCAT.[16]
Waiving Responsibility
NYANxCAT often includes a waiver that his code is not for malicious use. But examining samples of code signed by NYANxCAT we can see
them dropping ransomware, backdoors, and other kind of malware.[17] Moreover, studying NYANxCAT videos confirms those are not just
sandbox exercises, but involve actual victims.
Conclusion
NYANxCAT started his blackhat hacker career in at least 2018. While he is not the most advanced, his opportunistic behavior and abuse of
legitimate services such as YouTube and Github allows him to rapidly expand his criminal network and is negatively affecting the number of his
victims.
