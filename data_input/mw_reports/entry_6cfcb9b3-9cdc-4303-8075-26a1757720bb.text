Introduction
TeamTNT is a cybercrime group that targets cloud environments including Docker and
Kubernetes instances. The group has been previously documented using several tools
including crypto-miners and Amazon Web Services (AWS) credential stealing worms.

TeamTNT has also been spotted using a malicious Docker image which can be found on
Docker Hub to infect its victims’ servers. Now the group is evolving. In a recent attack
observed by Intezer, TeamTNT uses a new technique by abusing Weave Scope, a trusted
tool which gives the user full access to their cloud environment and is integrated with
Docker, Kubernetes, the Distributed Cloud Operating System (DC/OS), and AWS Elastic
Compute Cloud (ECS). The attackers install this tool in order to map the cloud environment
of their victim and execute system commands without deploying malicious code on the
server.
To our knowledge, this is the first time attackers have been caught using legitimate
third party software to target cloud infrastructure. When abused, Weave Scope gives
the attacker full visibility and control over all assets in the victim’s cloud environment,
essentially functioning as a backdoor.
Below we will describe the attack flow and the use of Weave Scope by the attacker.

Attack Flow
TeamTNT’s attacks typically involve the use of malicious Docker images from the Docker
Hub in addition to crypto-miners and malicious scripts. The uniqueness of the recent attack
observed by Intezer is the group abuses a legitimate open source tool called Weave Scope
to gain full control over the victim’s cloud infrastructure.
Weave Scope is an open source tool from Weave Works, a company that offers automation
tools for working with containerized applications. It provides monitoring, visualization, and
control over Docker and Kubernetes. Using a dashboard accessible from the browser the
user gains full control over the infrastructure including all information and metadata about
containers, processes, and hosts.
Weave Scope is a powerful utility, giving the attackers access to all information about the
victim’s server environment with the ability to control them including: installed applications,
connection between the cloud workloads, use of the memory and CPU, and a list of existing
containers with the ability to start, stop, and open interactive shells in any of these
containers. By installing a legitimate tool such as Weave Scope the attackers reap all the
benefits as if they had installed a backdoor on the server, with significantly less effort and
without needing to use malware.

The image above is a Weave Scope visualization of a Linux server. On the left is the open
terminal of a Nginx-based container. On the right is a view of all the containers on the
server.
To install Weave Scope on the server the attackers use an exposed Docker API port and
create a new privileged container with a clean Ubuntu image. The container is configured to
mount the file system of the container to the filesystem of the victim server, thus gaining the
attackers access to all files on the server. The initial command given to the container is to
download and execute several cryptominers.
The attackers then attempt to gain root access to the server by setting up a local privileged
user named ‘hilde’ on the host server and use it in order to connect back via SSH.
Next the attackers download and install Weave Scope. As described in the installation
guide in Weave Scope’s git, it takes only a few commands to complete installation of the
tool.

Once installed, the attackers can connect to the Weave Scope dashboard via HTTP on port
4040 and gain full visibility and control over the victim’s infrastructure.
From the dashboard the attackers can see a visual map of the Docker runtime cloud
environment and give shell commands without needing to deploy any malicious backdoor
component. Not only is this scenario incredibly rare, to our knowledge this is the first time
an attacker has downloaded legitimate software to use as an admin tool on the Linux
operating system.

Mitigation Recommendations
Precise and correct configuration of cloud workloads and services can prevent many
attacks which is why it’s important to take the time and effort to check them. To protect
yourself from this attack we recommend to:
Close exposed Docker API ports: This attack takes advantage of a common
misconfiguration of the Docker API which gives the attacker full control over the
Docker service. Therefore, Docker API ports should be closed or contain restricted
access policies in the firewall.
Block incoming connections to port 4040: Weave Scope uses default port 4040 to
make the dashboard accessible and anyone with access to the network can view the
dashboard. Similar to the Docker API port, this port should be closed or restricted by
the firewall.

Apply Zero Trust Execution to Your Workloads
Zero Trust Execution is viewed by market research firms as the best practice for securing
cloud workloads for reasons like the nature of this TeamTNT attack. ZTE creates a trusted
baseline of your workloads and monitors for any new process or injected code. Any
unauthorized code or applications that drift from the pre-approved baseline are blocked
from running in your cloud environment, allowing you to retain a trusted state.
In this scenario, although Weave Scope is a legitimate administration tool (it’s not malware
and therefore doesn’t contain malicious code), the application was still flagged by ZTE
because it’s unauthorized code that deviates from the trusted baseline.
This article explains how you can adopt a genetic-based ZTE approach to alleviate some of
the high overhead caused by traditional implementations.

Weave Works has since provided this in-depth article on how to prevent malicious attacks
using Weave Scope. The article covers both how Scope is used and how you can prevent it
being misused by securing it in any Kubernetes installation.
A special thank you to Idan Katz for his contribution to this research.
