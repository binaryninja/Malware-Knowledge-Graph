The blog has been updates at the request of Brazilian cybersecurity authorities
In January 2021, Group-IB Threat Intelligence unit discovered sensitive personal information
of over 20,000 Brazilian citizens on a publicly available server. The data set contained the
photos of individuals holding their national IDs. A quick analysis showed that the server had
been exposed for at least two months. While not entirely clear if this was a breach or a leak
and who was behind it, the data was most likely obtained from one of the Brazilian
government portals, as deeper examination revealed.

Our first thought was — wow, someone forgot a 55GB directory with sensitive data on a
publicly available server. The only right thing to do was to reach out to the relevant Brazilian
cybersecurity authorities so they could take the necessary actions to mitigate the risks

Anastasia Tikhonova, Head of Advanced Persistent Threat Research at Group-IB’s Threat
Intelligence team
Immediately upon discovery, Group-IB’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-GIB)
alerted Brazil's cybersecurity authorities about the incident. The case highlights the
importance of rapid threat intelligence exchange and collaboration between the CERTs all
over the world – the information provided by CERT-GIB was actioned swiftly. Within ten
hours, the server was taken offline.
This was not the first time Brazilians’ sensitive data ended up available to the public. In 2020,
personal records of over 243 million Brazilians were exposed. As the world goes digital, the
security risks of online identity verification are becoming more pervasive. The incident
demonstrates why government and private sector organizations that process sensitive
personal data need stringent cybersecurity measures, including threat intelligence and
hunting operations in place, to avoid financial losses, reputational damage, and data
breaches.
At the end of this post, cybersecurity professionals can find recommendations and
remediation techniques to avoid and address similar incidents.

How Group-IB uncovered the breach
As part of Group-IB’s threat intelligence gathering processes, the entire IPv4 internet space
is scanned continuously for anomalies, signs of suspicious and malicious activity,
misconfiguration causing digital assets to be exposed to a wider public. Automated tools
assess online resources and identify high-risk infrastructure that requires further evaluation.
In this case, a publicly accessible server hosted in the US with the directory listing function
enabled was discovered on 8th January. Disabling directory listing on a web server is a
normal security precaution to avoid the exposure of sensitive information. However, this was
not the case. Anyone on the internet could access the server’s contents.
Within the directory, several files were found, including a 27 GB zip-archive containing more
than 20,000 Brazilian citizens’ ID selfies, a custom web crawling script written in Python,
and an open source web tunneling tool.

Server directory
Based on the archive’s last modification date, Group-IB’s analysts concluded that the file had
been uploaded to the server no later than November 2021.
A crawler script, used for data collection, also caught Group-IB team’s attention. As its code
examination revealed, the crawler connected to one of the Brazilian government portals. The
crawler’s developer left a little more in the source code. Group-IB analysts spotted a phrase
in Portuguese which says “Deu erro aqui nessa merda!” (ENG: “You got this s*** wrong”).

The server in question was located outside of Brazil.

Given all the above evidence, it is fair to assume that the server appears to have been used
by an authorized third party as a staging area while they gathered sensitive personal
information with unclear but most likely malicious intent. However, it is not clear what was the
end goal of the party that collected sensitive data.

The privacy dangers of digital verification
Personal ID discovered on the server is the Cédula de identidade, the national identity
document in Brazil, commonly referred to as ‘carteira de identidade’ or simply “RG” (from
Registro Geral, General Registry). The card contains the name of the bearer, filiation, place
of birth, date of birth, signature and thumbprint of the bearer and, optionally, CPF number
(‘Cadastro de Pessoas Físicas’), the country’s individual taxpayer registry identification.
The identity card is used for a number of private and public purposes including obtaining a
driver's license, opening a bank account, buying or selling real estate, financing debts,
applying for a job, giving testimony in court, and entering some public buildings. The card
can also be used for travel between Mercosur member countries and associates (except
Guyana and Suriname).
Around the world, many organizations are implementing digital verification processes as they
undergo digital transformation, making the services available via mobile apps or web portals.
For the end-user, this model can be appealing; it is a fast and easy way to sign up for
services, completely removing the need to visit a physical point of presence. However, when
the data is not managed properly without cyber security considerations in mind, it is almost
inevitable that personal information will be exposed. Digital Verification based on selfies has
been gaining momentum in recent years and is used on everything from dating apps to tax
returns. Just in February, the US IRS had to walk back their use of selfie-based ID.ME
amidst a storm of privacy concerns.
Risks of having personal such information exposed vary for users and companies.
For the individuals that had their personal information exposed, they are at risk of:
Identity theft
Account takeover
Extortion
Spear phishing attacks
Theft of money

The organizations that experienced the data breach can also be at risk of:
Financial loss
Legal action
Reputational damage

Disclosure announcements if there is a breach

Upon the discovery, Group-IB’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-GIB)
immediately took steps to remediate the risks, and within 10 hours the server was taken
offline by the Brazil's cybersecurity authorities.

Why Group-IB reported this breach
Group-IB's mission is to fight against cybercrime. As part of this mission, Group-IB
continuously scans the internet for unsecured databases containing private and personal
information. When we uncover unsecured data, we immediately take steps to mitigate the
risks to users, organizations and government departments.
Under a responsible disclosure protocol, Group-IB always does its best to reach out to the
affected parties so they can take the necessary steps to eliminate the threat. Typically,
Group-IB launches an investigation to determine who the owner is, what information is at
risk, who is affected, and the potential impact on data subjects. After identifying whoever is
responsible for an exposed database, we utilize our contacts in the security community,
including CERTs, law enforcement partners and threat analysts, to alert the appropriate
parties to secure the data as quickly as possible.

Recommendations
How to prevent a similar data breach
Know all of your internet-facing assets
The forgotten server had an HTTP directory listing, which allowed anyone to discover and
utilize the information. Inappropriately exposed directory listing is categorized by MITRE as a
Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE-548).

6/8

Organizations should conduct attack surface management to identify all of their internetfacing assets, including servers that have been forgotten. An audit or vulnerability scan of the
identified infrastructure can reveal weaknesses including CWE-548, allowing security teams
to remediate them before they are exploited.
Prevent automated tools exploiting known vulnerabilities
Improper authentication (CWE-287) occurs when an unauthorized third party claims to be an
authenticated user, such as falsifying cookies to bypass authentication checks. This
technique is sometimes used in conjunction with Improper Control of Interaction Frequency
(CWE-799) which can allow the attacker to launch brute force attacks, such as repeatedly
guessing the credentials of an administrator until a correct combination is found.
Servers and applications should be penetration tested to identify security issues such as
CWE-287 and CWE-799. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) also known as web
application vulnerability scanning, is a method for finding externally visible issues and
vulnerabilities, and can further help identify issues. Equipping developers with Open Web
Application Security Project (OWASP) Top Ten Web Application Security Risks document
can help avoid the most critical security risks.
Prevent compromised information from being exploited
By identifying the exposed personal information Group-IB was able to alert Brazilian
authorities, allowing them to take steps to prevent the information from being used for
fraudulent purposes. For a private organization, a parallel could be identifying administrator
credentials for critical infrastructure on the internet, knowing that these credentials have been
compromised the organization can revoke the account’s permissions before it is used for
malicious purposes.
Scanning the open internet, dark web and closed threat actor forums for compromised
information can help prevent it from being utilized by threat actors. This activity is performed
by threat intelligence teams that have the resources and skills to find, process and
disseminate this information. Timeliness is a factor for preventing compromised information
from being used and should be a factor when evaluating threat intelligence solutions.

What to do if you believe you have experienced a breach
If an attack has taken place the first step is to remove the threat actor from your network,
revoking account privileges, disabling communications with C2 servers and disrupting any
persistence techniques. The anatomy of the attack should then be explored to understand
the kill chain that allowed the attacker to gain a foothold within the organization and move
laterally. Lastly, remediating steps should be actioned to prevent similar attacks from
occurring in the future.
