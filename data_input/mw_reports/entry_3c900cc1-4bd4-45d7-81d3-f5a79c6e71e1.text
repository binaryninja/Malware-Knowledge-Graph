May 21 2020 Edition
Howdy, and welcome to the ThreatConnect Research Roundup, a collection of recent
findings by our Research Team and items from open source publications that have resulted
in Observations of related indicators across ThreatConnect’s CAL™ (Collective Analytics
Layer).

Roundup Highlight: Possible APT33 Infrastructure

Our highlight in this Roundup is Incident 20200518A: Suspicious Realhosters Name Server
Domain taskreminder[.]net, which identifies network infrastructure possibly related to APT33.
The domain taskreminder[.]net was registered on May 14 2020 using
wayne.williams1986@protonmail[.]com and uses a ns1.realhosters.com name server. As of
May 18 2020, this domain is hosted on a probable dedicated server at OVH IP
137.74.157[.]84.

While not definitive in terms of attribution, it’s worth noting that some APT33 related
infrastructure like times-sync[.]com has previously used the same name server and OVH IP
space for hosting. For example, the 137.74.157[.]84 IP was identified in a December 2019
Trend Micro report on APT33 obfuscated botnets. Previously identified infrastructure was
documented in 20200106A: Suspicious Realhosters Name Server Domains.
We don’t have any information on the extent to which, if any, this domain has been used
maliciously. However, given the minimal use of the ns1.realhosters.com name server and
APT33’s potential reuse of it, any domains using it merit scrutiny as possible APT33
domains.

Update 5/21/20: The taskreminder[.]net domain is now hosted on a probable dedicated
server at OVH IP 91.134.187[.]25. To receive ThreatConnect notifications about updates to
Host DNS changes, remember to check the “Follow Item” box on that item’s Details page.

ThreatConnect Research Team Intelligence:
These are items recently created or updated in the ThreatConnect Common Community by
our Research Team. They include threat actor profiles, malware families, campaigns,
signatures, and incidents based on our research and threat hunting activities. This week, we
highlight new infrastructure registered using previously observed APT33 techniques,
suspicious domains spoofing Poste Italiane, and an update to previously reported domains
using “msupdate” strings.
20200514A: Poste Italiane Spoofed Domains Registered through Reg[.]ru
ThreatConnect Research identified a series of domains spoofing Poste Italiane that
have been registered through Reg.ru since late April 2020 and are hosted on probable
dedicated servers. While we have not identified activity leveraging these domains,
given the domain name strings, they probably have been used in credential harvesting
efforts.
20200511A: Suspicious “msupdate” Domains Registered Through Njalla
ThreatConnect Research identified three “msupdate” themed domains that were
registered at essentially the same time through Njalla on May 9 2020. As of May 11
2020, the domains have not been hosted. The identified domains include the following:
afr-msupdate.com
asia-msupdate.com
de-msupdate.com
Update 5/13/20: The aforementioned domains are now hosted on a probable dedicated
server at OVH IP 158.69.30.194. Additionally, the domains are also now using their own
name servers.
