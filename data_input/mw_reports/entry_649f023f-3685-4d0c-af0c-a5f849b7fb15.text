November 29, 2019

While we have been following cyberespionage group TICK (a.k.a. “BRONZE BUTLER” or
“REDBALDKNIGHT”) since 2008, we noticed an unusual increase in malware development
and deployments towards November 2018. We already know that the group uses previously
deployed malware and modified tools for obfuscation, but we also found TICK developing
new malware families capable of detection evasion for initial intrusion, as well as escalation
of administrative privileges for subsequent attacks and data collection. We also found the
group using legitimate email accounts and credentials for the delivery of the malware,
zeroing in on industries with highly classified information: defense, aerospace, chemical, and
satellite industries with head offices in Japan and subsidiaries in China. Given their targets,
we have named this campaign “Operation ENDTRADE,” and identified some of the findings
in our research “Operation ENDTRADE: TICK’s Multi-Stage Backdoors for Attacking
Industries and Stealing Classified Data”.
This research paper was submitted and presented for the DeepINTEL Security Intelligence
2019 Conference on November 27, 2019 in Vienna, Austria.

As part of their attacks in January 2019, TICK was conducting their research by
compromising a Japanese economic research company and a public relations (PR) agency
to steal email credentials and files as decoy documents. These email addresses were used
for spear phishing, prompting potential victim organizations to open the attachments with
malware payloads. Meanwhile, the documents were embedded with malware, and sent to
individuals and companies knowledgeable in Japanese or Chinese, and interested in the
Chinese economy. The emails had the following features:
They were sent from legitimate email accounts
They were written as legitimate reports and prompted the users to open the
attachments
They contained subject topics related to “salary rate increase” or “job market,” or with
special interests in the economic affairs of China such as the US-China trade mandates

Figure 2. Spear phishing sample in fluent Japanese
Based on the language that was hardcoded in the samples we found, TICK appeared to be
targeting Japanese organizations with subsidiaries in China to serve as footholds for
intrusion: TICK hard-coded two code pages 932 and 936, referring to Japanese and
Simplified Chinese characters respectively. Moreover, we found successful transfers of
malicious executable files in the shared folder from a Chinese subsidiary with an infected
desktop, and an employee in Japan that executed the said file.
Figure 3. Language code pages
While we found intrusions in a large number of companies in the abovementioned industries
before May 2019, further analysis revealed that one of the main targets was the defense
sector. We found TICK trying to steal military-related documents from the victim network
during an extended assistance for incident response in the region. However, TICK seemed to
shift their attention to the chemical industry by mid-May, which may indicate the group’s
sponsor organization’s goal: To steal proprietary and classified information such as military
data and advanced materials.
Malware Analysis
Our research lists some of the new and adjusted malware routines we found from Operation
ENDTRADE, which we named based on their characteristic program database (PDB)
strings. For a complete list and analyses of the trojans, downloaders, and modified tools, you
may access the research brief here.

DATPER
While this backdoor routine has been associated with TICK’s weapons arsenal, the sample
we derived from this campaign had two adjusted mutex objects — d0ftyzxcdrfdqwe and
*&Hjgfc49gna-2-tjb — that retrieve information from the victim’s machine. The latest variant
also has a new set of parameters that allow it to evade anti-virus (AV) product pattern
detections, implying the ease by which the group can change their routines to suit their
goals.

down_new
This malware combines features of existing trojans in the malware family’s development,
based on the adjustments TICK made as we analyzed their test versions. It adds features
(listed below) that can be found separately on previous iterations:
Adds Autorun to the registry.
Gets MAC address and volume information to send back to the C&C.
Executes only during working hours (8:00AM-6:00PM, using kernel32.GetLocalTime
API)
Uses AES encryption and base64 encoding method to encrypt the call back message.
Uses legitimate websites for the C&C server.
Detects anti-virus products and processes.

Table 1. down_new command list
As we studied its processes to compare with the others, the call back information stood out:
The HTTP post header is hard-coded in the sample, getting the infected machine’s specific
information to single out the identity of the users. As a cyber-espionage group with specific
goals based on their sponsoring organization’s objectives, TICK only goes after specific
targets and only uses other non-targeted individuals and enterprises as footholds to meet
their purposes.

Avenger
Our analysis found that Avenger has a number of variants and versions depending on their
targets. For example, some variants have autorun functions while others execute a sleep
mode upon system infection. We found that the downloader has three stages:
3/6

1. The first stage collects volume information, AV product, and OS bits version from the
host, and sends it to the command and control (C&C) server to ensure that the host is
the intended target.

Figure 8. First stage: Information collection
2. It then checks if the host matches their C&C server reference. Avenger collects the
victim’s detailed information from the system by browsing the folders, files, and domain
information.
Figure 9. Second stage: Collected information is written into a .txt file
3. If the host doesn’t exist, Avenger will download an image with an embedded
malware hidden via steganography and extract a backdoor.
Figure 10. Third stage: Sending the encrypted file to the C&C
While steganography is always used as part of TICK’s malware techniques, we found that
the group used a more sophisticated steganography technique in this campaign.

Figure 12. Upgraded steganography technique
We found a newer version of Avenger with a clearer code structure and internal IP testing
URL (aptly named Avenger2 in the PDB strings), though the rest of the components had
minimal differences with the previous version.

Casper
Casper is a modified version of the Cobalt Strike backdoor, showing the team server SHA1
hash if the controller connects to the C&C. If accessed by the client, Cobalt Strike confirms
with the user if they recognize and match the SHA1 hash of a specific team server’s SSL
certificate.
Figure 14. Casper C&C with Cobalt Strike’s server fingerprint
The backdoor is usually hidden in the steganography photo and uses several techniques and
tools to bypass AV detection. One technique involves launching itself with a legitimate
Windows application with Dynamic Link Library (DLL) side loading techniques. Another
involves injecting the backdoor’s shellcode into svchost.exe.

Publicly available RATs and modified tools
Included in all the malware routines, we also found TICK using publicly available remote
access trojans (RATs) and ope n source tools, and either modified or imported the
techniques into their malware. For instance, they cloned Lilith RAT from GitHub, studied and
implemented its features into their customized backdoor under continued development. The
list of modified tools the group used include Mimikatz, RAR compression tool, port mapping
tool, and screen capture.

Conclusion
TICK is an organized and persistent cyber espionage group specialized in targeting highvalue individuals and organizations, with the skills and resources needed to coordinate
sophisticated attacks.
This operation not only highlights the need for stronger monitoring systems foremost in
countries’ critical infrastructures and multinational enterprises, but also firmer operational
chains of command and redundant security policies established. Persistent criminal groups
will continue to target enterprises, and will look for security gaps to exploit to gain
unauthorized entry. Organizations with foreign subsidiaries can make it difficult to take
control and implement security procedures and policies, making monitoring, isolating,
investigating, incident response, and recovery more difficult. To top it all, employees’ security
awareness and consciousness will remain a significant part of making sure the security
measures in place are maintained for regular operations.
