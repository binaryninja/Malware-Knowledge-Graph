From Word to Lateral Movement in 1 Hour
thedfirreport.com/2021/06/20/from-word-to-lateral-movement-in-1-hour/
June 20, 2021

Introduction
In May 2021, we observed a threat actor conducting an intrusion utilizing the IcedID
payloads for initial access. They later performed a number of techniques from host discovery
to lateral movement, using RDP and SMB to access the file servers within an enterprise
domain.
IcedID (known as BokBot) first observed in 2017, continues to be an active and capable
threat against both individuals and organizations. The IcedID malware utilizes a modular
malware framework and incorporates a number of anti-forensic and defense evasion
capabilities. This malware has like others before it moved into the initial access broker
market being used as an entry point for follow on activity like Cobalt Strike, and has lead to
multiple domain wide ransomware deployments such as Revil and Conti.

Summary
We assess with medium confidence that the initial IcedID infection was delivered via a
malspam campaign, which included an attachment with a password protected zip archive.
Once extracted, the user would find a Word document with a macro, which upon execution,

1/18

would deliver the initial DLL loader. Discovered in 2017, what started as a commodity
malware, IcedID is now currently being deployed as an initial access broker by ransomware
threat actors.
In this case, the threat actor appeared to have specific goals, and did not waste any time.
Within 35 minutes after the initial infection, they made their way in to the network via a Cobalt
Strike Beacon deployed from the IcedID infected host.
The first task of the threat actor was to enumerate the network by establishing a list of the
domain admins using living off the land techniques, such as net.exe. A freely available tool
Adfind.exe was also utilized to further enumerate the domain. The threat actor was also
observed stealing credentials from the lsass.exe process.
Five minutes after the above discovery activity, we observed the actors moving laterally to
other hosts on the network with the credentials of a domain administrator account. In this
case, Cobalt Strike was also used to create the administrative token, and attempted to install
a service using a windows service executable. The service was tasked to run an encoded
PowerShell command which would download and execute the Cobalt Strike beacon over
HTTP.
Based on the name of the hosts that the threat actors decided to pivot, we judge that they
were able to digest the ‘AdFind’ results and focus on, what they believed to be, important
targets – critical assets such as file servers, domain controllers, etc. It is also worth
mentioning that even after the unsuccessful remote execution attempt against a few servers
due to AV, the actors decided to connect via RDP and spend over an hour looking for
valuable data before disconnecting and leaving the network.
No exfiltration of data or impact to the systems was observed but at least one command and
control. It is unclear why the actors decided not to continue with their operation. No attempt
was made to clean up the intrusion by the actors – artifacts that were deployed were still in
operation, including C2 implants.

Services
We offer multiple services including a Threat Feed service which tracks Command and
Control frameworks such as Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, Empire, PoshC2, etc. More
information on this service and others can be found here. The Cobalt Strike server used in
this attack was added to our Threat Feed on 5/7/21.
We also have artifacts available from this case such as pcaps, memory captures, files, Kape
packages, and more, under our Security Researcher and Organization services.

Initial Access
The first stage of the IcedID malware that was executed on the host was dropped via a
macro enabled Word document – as seen by Unit42.

In our case, the IcedID dll loader was manually executed using regsvr32.

Persistence
From the initial access, a scheduled task was created. This can be observed by EventID
106: New task registered:

4/18

Inspection of the task file located under ‘c:\windows\system32\tasks’:

‘License.dat’ is an encrypted binary file and is a tell-tale indication of an IcedID compromise.
The corresponding DLL (upefkuin4.dll) is used with license.dat to maintain persistence using
the Task Scheduler. After decrypting License.dat using Binary Defense’s decryption tool, we
can see some information stealing functionality:

5/18

EventID 200: Task executed shows the persistent IcedID core being executed, on average
every 1 hour via Rundll32.exe.

Credential Access
The LSASS process was accessed by an unusual process “wuauclt.exe” on the beachhead
host. This was the Cobalt Strike Beacon and was used to access the credentials.

6/18

EventID: 10
Description: Process Access
SourceImage: "C:\Windows\system32\WUAUCLT.exe"
TargetImage: “C:\Windows\system32\lsass.exe”
GrantedAccess: 0x1FFFFF
CallTrace:
C:\Windows\SYSTEM32\ntdll.dll+9c584|C:\Windows\System32\KERNELBASE.dll+2730e|UNKNOWN(0

This is not the first time we have observed this process (wuauclt.exe) being used. In our
previous report with another IcedID infection leading to Sodinokibi ransomware we also
observed the same process being used.
The same process was also observed invoking PowerShell scripts:

“Wuauclt.exe” is normally used for the Microsoft Windows Update Service and this was an
attempt to blend into the OS environment.

Discovery
Discovery commands were run by IcedID during the initial execution on the beachhead.
These commands use the Microsoft Windows built-in commands and utilities, such as
WMIC, ipconfig, etc. The aim was to determine the installed Anti-virus software, network
configuration, domain configuration and user accounts. The following are the commands that
were executed:
7/18

WMIC /Node: localhost /Namespace: \\root \SecurityCenter2 Path AntiVirusProduct Get *
/Format: List
ipconfig /all
systeminfo
net config workstation
nltest /domain_trusts
nltest /domain_trusts /all_trusts
net view /all /domain
net view /all

Using the information gathered, the IcedID operator was able to focus on specific targets,
obtaining access to the privileged accounts and the high value hosts.
Once the IcedID operators were able to establish a C2 session to the initial compromised
host, the operators were observed executing the following command:
net group "domain admins" /DOMAIN

Interestingly, we observed the operator deploying and utilizing AdFind to collect information
about the hosts on the network. AdFind is an Active Directory query tool developed by
JoeWare, a useful utility for system administrators, but also popular among threat actors.
cmd.exe /C C:\Recovery\AdFind.exe -f objectcategory=computer -csv name cn
OperatingSystem dNSHostName > C:\Recovery\DOMAIN.csv

AdFind was transferred and executed on the beachhead host. The threat actor placed the
AdFind binary and the results in the ‘C:\Recovery’ folder. We assess this folder location was
chosen to avoid raising suspicion, as compared to executing from a user or temporary folder
location.

Lateral Movement
The threat actors attempted and successfully managed to pivot laterally to various hosts on
the domain. This was achieved by connecting via SMB and starting a service that would
execute an encrypted PowerShell command with embedded Cobalt Strike SMB beacons.

8/18

The PowerShell is base64 encoded. Decoding the PowerShell shows that the SMB pipe is
named \\.\pipe\halfduplux_9e.

Using the ‘Administrator’ account, SMB sessions were established to the hosts, primarily
using ADMIN$, but IPC$ was also observed.

This activity triggered two Emerging Threat (ET) alerts related to RPC access and binary
execution, “ET RPC DCERPC SVCCTL – Remote Service Control Manager Access” and
“ET POLICY SMB2 NT Create AndX Request For an Executable File”.

Command and Control
IcedID:
Throughout the intrusion the threat actor used a mix of Port 80 and 443 for C2. Port 80 was
observed in the communication to testsubnet[.]com which contains a HTTP Cookie in the
format: wordpress_<Base64EncodedString>. This activity was observed at a rate of every 24 seconds.
