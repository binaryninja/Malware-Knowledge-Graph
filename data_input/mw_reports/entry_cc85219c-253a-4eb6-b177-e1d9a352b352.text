Background story 1/2

 At the end of April 2020, Diebold Nixdorf, one of the world's largest ATM
manufacturers experienced an IT outage of some of their services.
 This included the company's homepage and some of its mail servers,
which were temporarily unavailable.

Background story 2/2
 On May 11, 2020 Krebsonsecurity.com
reported about a ransomware incident at
Diebold Nixdorf.
 Some key statements:
 According to DN, the company‘s security team
discovered a ransomware attack on April 25,
2020.
 An investigation determined that the attackers
installed the ProLock ransomware.
 The incident did not affect the ATMs
customers networks or the general public and
its impact was not material to their business.
 DN informed their customers about the
situation and how they addressed it.

Risk situation from customers perspective 1/2
 Unfortunately, the detail level in the blog post
was not comprehensive enough to adequately
clarify the question of how the attacks could
spread to the company's own IT
infrastructure.
 Due to the increasing number of supply chain
attacks in the last three years, the risk
situation in the financial sector has also
changed significantly.
 This has led us to consider some worst-case
scenarios which were already observed in the
wild in a similar form.

CLEAN SUPPLY CHAIN

Service Provider

Manufacturer

Customers

Risk situation from customers perspective 2/2

 Assuming threat actors successfully
implemented a sophisticated backdoor in
the manufacturer’s ATM sources, they
could gain unauthorized access to all
devices on which the modified code has
been deployed.
 Furthermore, stolen credentials typically
intended for customer support access,
could also lead to attacker opportunities.

INFECTED SUPPLY CHAIN

How the investigation started 1/3
 Looking for more details about the perpetrators, their actions and objectives,
Fiducia & GAD conducted its own investigation to better understand the risk
situation.
 A specific search on the Virustotal resulted in two documents that were
uploaded at the beginning of May 2020.

How the investigation started 2/3
 Inspecting the file with hash 5267cc… reveals information about its origin,
its creator and another editor of the document.
 In addition, there is also the date of initial creation on April 28, 2020 and
the date of the last editing on May 1, 2020.

How the investigation started 3/3
 The document was uploaded from Slovakia by an unknown
user.
 Based on the DN job openings (as of May 2020) available in
that country, it is reasonable to assume that an incident
response analyst from the Security Operations Center
decided to scan the file for viruses before execution and
uploaded it to Virustotal.
 An OpSec failure unfortunately occurring quite often, even
among people with security know-how.

Examination of the document content 1/2
(hash 5267cc…)

 The forensic traces confirm the statements
on Krebsonsecurity.com that files were
encrypted with the ProLock ransomware.
 Another interesting IOC is the reference to a
Qakbot payload.
 On May 4, 2020 the FBI issued a security
alert reporting the ProLock gang gains
initial access to victim networks via the
Qakbot trojan since March 2020.
 Files such as rdp.bat, Psexec.exe and
adfind.exe were likely used for lateral
movement to gain access to the domain
controller or other interesting targets.

Examination of the document content 2/2
(hash 5267cc…)

 In addition to the Qakbot sample, the payload domain can also be
found in the IOC document  sollight.com[.]hk
 Apparently, IP addresses of the range 172.x.x.x also showed malicious
activity, which will be discussed later.

Infection timeline
 A Netflow analysis of the Qakbot
payload domain sollight.com[.]hk
reveals a top talker with a source IP
208.87.12.248 (belonging to DieboldNixdorf US).
 As the chart illustrates the
communication to the C2 has been
terminated on April 26, 2020 after the
company's employees noticed the
attack and disconnected systems from
their network to contain the spread of
the malware. This coincides with the
statements in the report on
Krebsonsecurity.com

Reconstructed infection process

Malicious file analysis
Operating Agreement_1.doc
Compressed OLE stream containing
obfuscated malicious macro code

Deobfuscated macro code reveals
PowerShell script downloading and
executing the Qakbot payload.

Payload staging
Based on the 172.x.x.x IP addresses from the IOC report, payloads were identified involved in the attack.
For staging purposes attackers spawned a PowerShell script on infected systems, which in turn applies a
Cobalt Strike shellcode.

ProLock Ransomware installation process 1/3
There are usually 4 files involved in the installation of the ProLock ransomware:





run.bat
WinMgr.xml
clean.bat
WinMgr.bmp

Filenames can vary, e.g. next to .BMP files also other formats have been spotted itw.
Diebold-Nixdorf case  A fake .DIB file, which is preceded by a
random 8-character name, e.g. 8A67B05B.dib, as the IOC report reveals.
The file Run.bat is used to install a scheduled task on the Windows target systems.

ProLock Ransomware installation process 2/3
Schtasks.exe parses the configuration data from the file
WinMgr.xml and then executes clean.bat.

Clean.bat then executes a Base64-encoded PowerShell script.
…

ProLock Ransomware installation process 3/3
 The decoded PowerShell script then reads the content of WinMgr.bmp
 At first sight it appears to be a legitimate image file, but at a certain position the file
contains the actual ProLock Ransomware shellcode, which the PowerShell script
reads and then executes in memory.

Runtime decryption
ProLock decrypts suspicious strings at runtime, trying to stay under the radar as long as possible.

Conclusion
 Ransomware attacks have increased massively in the last two
years, and the success rate even at large companies
illustrates how sophisticated and professional the perpetrators
operate to reach their goal.
 If companies become victims of such an attack, a quick
response is essential before the attackers can encrypt
systems and/or exfiltrate sensitive data.
 Keeping in mind that supply chain attacks are a growing
threat, affected companies should provide customers with as
much as information as possible, including TTPs, IOCs and
recommendation for actions.
 Gaining threat intelligence can help to get more insights even
without having first hand information.

Thanks to @Cocaman for exchanging ideas!
Acknowledgement to Diebold Nixdorf for being
cooperative after sharing my analysis with them,
which allowed us to get further insights into their
internal DFIR process of this case.
