A large number of state organizations and businesses from various industry fields in the Ukraine and Poland
have been targeted in recent attacks. What would otherwise be a mundane scenario in today's world of
cybercrime is spiced up by the fact that the malware-spreading campaigns have leveraged the tense current
geopolitical situation in Eastern Ukraine and the use of a malware family with a rich history. The most recent
campaigns are dated August 2014.
BlackEnergy is a trojan which has undergone significant functional changes since it was first publicly analysed
by Arbor Networks in 2007. It has evolved from a relatively simple DDoS trojan into a relatively sophisticated
piece of modern malware with a modular architecture, making it a suitable tool for sending spam and for online
bank fraud, as well as for targeted attacks. BlackEnergy version 2, which featured rootkit techniques, was
documented by SecureWorks in 2010. The targeted attacks recently discovered are proof that the trojan is still
alive and kicking in 2014.
We provide a technical analysis of the BlackEnergy family, focusing on novel functionality and the differences
introduced by new 'lite' variants. We describe the most notable aspects of the malware, including its techniques
for bypassing UAC, defeating the signed driver requirement in Windows and a selection of BlackEnergy2 plugins used for parasitic file infections, network discovery and remote code execution and data collection.
The many targets in the Ukraine and Poland have been infected through several known and unknown infection
vectors. The most effective ones appear to be spear-phishing emails with subjects related to the current
Ukrainian crisis combined with the exploitation of MS Office documents. CVE-2014-1761, which made the
headlines earlier this year, was also used to spread BlackEnergy.
Apart from sharing our most noteworthy findings, we aim to pose some questions that warrant further
research.
