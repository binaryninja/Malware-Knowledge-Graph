Linux Backdoor RedXOR Likely Operated by Chinese Nation-State

2020 set a record for new Linux malware families. New malware families targeting
Linux systems are being discovered on a regular basis. Backdoors attributed to advanced
threat actors are disclosed less frequently.
We have discovered an undocumented backdoor targeting Linux systems, masqueraded
as polkit daemon. We named it RedXOR for its network data encoding scheme based
on XOR.
Based on victimology, as well as similar components and Tactics, Techniques, and
Procedures (TTPs), we believe RedXOR was developed by high profile Chinese threat
actors. The samples, which have low detection rates in VirusTotal, were uploaded from
Indonesia and Taiwan, countries known to be targeted by Chinese threat actors. The
samples are compiled with a legacy GCC compiler on an old release of Red Hat
Enterprise Linux, hinting that RedXOR is used in targeted attacks against legacy Linux
systems.
During our investigation we experienced an “on and off” availability of the Command
and Control (C2) server indicating that the operation is still active.

Connections to Chinese Threat Actors
We uncovered key similarities between RedXOR and previously reported malware
associated with Winnti umbrella threat group. These malware are PWNLNX backdoor
and XOR.DDOS and Groundhog, two botnets attributed to Winnti by BlackBerry.
The below samples can be used for reference:
Similarities between the samples:
1. Use of old open-source kernel rootkits: RedXOR uses an open-source LKM
rootkit called “Adore-ng” to hide its process. Based on a FireEye report Winnti
used this rootkit in their “ADORE.XSE” Linux backdoor. Embedding open-source
LKM rootkits is a common Winnti technique. The group has been documented
using Azazel and Suterusu.
2. The CheckLKM function name used by RedXOR has also been used in PWNLNX
and XOR.DDOS.
3. Provides the operator with a pseudo-terminal: RedXOR uses Python pty
shell by importing the python pty library. PWNLNX implements the pty shell
function in c.

4. Encoding network with XOR: The backdoor encodes its network data with a
scheme based on XOR. Encoding network data with XOR has been used in
previous Winnti malware including PWNLNX.
5. Persistence service name: As part of its persistence methods, RedXOR
attempts to create a service under rc.d. The developer added “S99” before the
name of the service to lower its priority and make it run last on system initiation.
This technique was used in XOR.DDOS and Groundhog samples where the
malware developer added “S90” to the service name.
6. Main functions flow: PWNLX and RedXOR have a main function which is in
charge of initialization. In both backdoors, the main function calls another
function which is in charge of the main logic. The main logic function names are
main_process in RedXOR and MainThread in PWLNX. Both main functions
daemonize the process to detach from the terminal and run in the background.

7. XML for file listing: RedXOR’s directory function and PWNLNX’s getfiles
function are both in charge of directory listing. Their code flow implementation is
different, however, as both malware send the directory listing as an XML file to the
C2 server. Figure 2 shows the XML structure used in PWNLNX and RedXOR. The
file’s data used in both functions are: path, name, type, user, permission, size,
time.

Figure 2: The XML structure used by PWNLNX’s getfiles function and RedXOR’s
directory function
8. Legacy Red Hat compilers: RedXOR and PWNLNX were both compiled with a
Red Hat 4.4.7 compiler. This compiler is the default GCC compiler on RHEL6.
9. Chown similarity: Both PWNLNX and RedXOR change the file’s user and group
owner to a large ID. The same technique has been used by the XOR.DDoS malware
as referenced in the analysis by MalwareMustDie.

Figure 3: Similarity between PWNLNX and RedXOR of the UID and GID used
with “lchown” function call
10. Overall flow and functionalities: The overall code flow, behavior, and
capabilities of RedXOR are very similar to PWNLNX. Both have file uploading and
downloading functionalities together with a running shell. The network tunneling
functionality in both families is called “PortMap”.
11. Unstripped ELF binaries: Malware developers will often tamper with a file’s
symbols and/or sections, making it harder for researchers to analyze them.
However, RedXOR and various Winnti malware, including PWNLNX and
XOR.DDOS, are unstripped.

Technical Analysis
The samples are both unstripped 64-bit ELF files called po1kitd-update-k. Uploaded
to VirusTotal from Taiwan and Indonesia, they are low detected at the time of this
writing.

Malware Installation
Upon execution RedXOR forks off a child process allowing the parent process to exit.
The purpose is to detach the process from the shell. The new child determines if it has
been executed as the root user or as another user on the system. It does this to create a
hidden folder, called “.po1kitd.thumb”, inside the user’s home folder which is used to
store files related to the malware. The malware creates a hidden file called “.po1kitd2a4D53” inside the folder. The file is locked to the current running process, seen in
Figure 5, essentially creating a mutex. If another instance of the malware is executed, it
also tries to obtain the lock but ultimately fails. Upon this failure the process exits.

Figure 5: The malware creates a “mutex” file locking it to the process ID
After the malware creates the mutex, it installs itself on the infected machine. As shown
in Figure 6, the malware looks up its current path and moves the binary to the created
folder. It hides the file by naming it “.po1kitd-update-k”.

Figure 6: Malware moves the binary to the hidden folder “po1kitd.thumb” created
earlier. It first tries to use the “rename” function provided by libc. If this fails, it
executes an “mv” shell command via the “system” function
After installing the binary to the hidden folder, the malware sets up persistence via “init”
scripts. The following files are created after executing the malware on boot:
/usr/syno/etc/rc.d/S99po1kitd-update.sh
/etc/init.d/po1kitd-update
/etc/rc2.d/S99po1kitd-update
The malware checks if the rootkit is active by creating a file and removing it. Then, the
malware compares the “saved set-user-ID” of the process to the user ID. If they don’t
match, the rootkit is enabled. If they match, it looks to see if the user ID is “10”. If this is
the case, the rootkit is enabled. This logic is shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7: Logic used by RedXOR to check if the rootkit is enabled
The “CheckLKM” logic is almost identical to the “adore_init” function in the “adore-ng”
rootkit. Afore-ng is a Chinese open-source LKM (Loadable Kernel Module) rootkit. This
technique allows the malware to stay under the radar by hiding its processes. The code
for the init function is shown in Figure 8.

Configuration
The malware stores the configuration encrypted within the binary. In addition to the
Command and control (C2) IP address and port it can also be configured to use a proxy.
The configuration includes a password, as can be seen in Figure 9. This password is used
by the malware to authenticate to the C2 server.

Figure 9: Configuration options for the malware
The configuration values are decrypted by the “doXor” function. A pseudo-code
representation of the function is shown in Figure 10. The decryption logic is a simple
XOR against a byte key. The byte key is incremented by a constant for each item in the
buffer. The only configuration value that is not encrypted is the server port. The port
value is used to derive the key and the adder. The key is derived from bit shifting the
port value eight steps to the right. The constant uses the port value.

byte that is incremented by a constant for each entry in the buffer

Communication with the C2
The malware communicates with the C2 server over a TCP socket. The traffic is made to
look like HTTP traffic. Figure 11 shows a pseudo-code representation of the function
used by the malware to prepare data that is to be sent to the C2 server. First, it fills the
buffer with null bytes. The request body is XORed against a key. The malware uses the
buffer length as the key. This value is also passed into the function as the “total_length”
argument.

Figure 11: Function for preparing data to be sent to the C2 server
The same logic is used to decrypt the response body from the C2 server. From the
response, the malware extracts “JSESSIONID”, “Content-Length”, “Total-Length” and
the response body. The data is added to a struct with the following layout:
0x0 JSESSIONID as int
0x8 Content-Length as long
0x10 Total-Length as long
0x18 Response body

The content length is the length of the response body but also used as the key. The total
length value is used as a constant which is added to the key in each iteration. The
JSESSIONID value holds the command ID for the job the C2 wants the malware to
perform.

Commands
The C2 server tells the malware to execute different commands via a command code that
is returned in the “JSESSIONID” cookie. The codes are encoded as decimal integers. A
full list of commands supported by the analyzed malware sample are shown in the table
below. They can be grouped into command types. Commands in the 2000 range provide
“filesystem” interaction, 3000 handle “shell” commands, and 4000 handle network
tunneling.

System Information
When the malware first contacts the C2 server it sends a password encoded in the
request body. The C2 server responds with the command code 0 to collect system
information. The data collected about the system by the malware is listed in the table
below. The data is serialized into a URL query-like string, encrypted and then sent as the
request body.

Update Functionality
The malware can be updated by the threat actor. This is performed by sending command
code 8 to the malware. When the malware receives this code the following actions are
taken:
The malware opens the mutex file for writing.
It sends a request with the command code 8 and an empty request body to the C2
server.
The response body from the server is written to the mutex file. The response body
is not encrypted.
The lock is released on the mutex file.
The malware executes “chmod” to set the execution flag on the file via the libc
system function.

The malware sleeps and tries to obtain the lock on the file again when it wakes up.
If it fails, it assumes the update was successful, closes the connection to the C2
server and exits.

Shell Functionality
The malware has the ability to provide its operator with a “tty” shell. If a shell is
requested via the command code 3000, the malware creates a new thread executing
“/bin/sh”. In the new spawned shell, the malware executes python -c “import
pty;pty.spawn(‘/bin/sh’)” to get a pseudo-terminal (pty) interface. Any shell commands
sent to the malware with the command code of 3058 are executed in the pty and the
response is returned to the operator.

Network Tunneling
Network tunneling is enabled by sending the command code 4001 to the malware. As
part of the request, a “configuration” is sent as part of the response body. The
configuration consists of three items separated by a “#” character. The items are: a port
to bind to, the IP to connect to, and a port to connect to. The malware uses a modified
version of the open-source project Rinetd for the tunneling logic. Rinetd is designed to
use a configuration file stored on the machine. To get around this, the malware author
has modified the function that parses the configuration in order to directly take the
required values normally found in the configuration file.
