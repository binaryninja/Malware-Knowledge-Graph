As the IT and OT environment becomes more complex, adversaries are quick to adapt
their attack strategy. For example, as users’ work environments diversify, adversaries are
busy acquiring the TTPs to infiltrate systems. Recently, we reported to our Threat
Intelligence Portal customers a similar malware framework that internally we called
MATA. The MATA malware framework possesses several components, such as loader,
orchestrator and plugins. This comprehensive framework is able to target Windows,
Linux and macOS operating systems.
The first artefacts we found relating to MATA were used around April 2018. After that,
the actor behind this advanced malware framework used it aggressively to infiltrate
corporate entities around the world. We identified several victims from our telemetry and
figured out the purpose of this malware framework.

Windows version of MATA
The Windows version of MATA consists of several components. According to our
telemetry, the actor used a loader malware to load the encrypted next-stage payload.
We’re not sure that the loaded payload is the orchestrator malware, but almost all victims
have the loader and orchestrator on the same machine.

This loader takes a hardcoded hex-string, converts it to binary and AES-decrypts it in
order to obtain the path to the payload file. Each loader has a hard-coded path to load the
encrypted payload. The payload file is then AES-decrypted and loaded.
From the loader malware found on one of the compromised victims, we discovered that
the parent process which executes the loader malware is the
“C:\Windows\System32\wbem\WmiPrvSE.exe” process. The WmiPrvSE.exe process is
“WMI Provider Host process”, and it usually means the actor has executed this loader
malware from a remote host to move laterally. Therefore, we assess that the actor used
this loader to compromise additional hosts in the same network.

Orchestrator and plugins
We discovered the orchestrator malware in the lsass.exe process on victims’ machines.
This orchestrator malware loads encrypted configuration data from a registry key and
decrypts it with the AES algorithm. Unless the registry value exists, the malware uses
hard-coded configuration data. The following is a configuration value example from one
orchestrator malware sample:
Victim ID

Random 24-bit
number

Internal version number

3.1.1 (0x030101)

Timeout

20 minutes

C2 addresses

108.170.31[.]81:443
192.210.239[.]122:443
111.90.146[.]105:443

Disk path or URL of plugin (up to 15) to be loaded on
start

Not used in this
malware

The orchestrator can load 15 plugins at the same time. There are three ways to load them:
Download the plugin from the specified HTTP or HTTPS server
Load the AES-encrypted plugin file from a specified disk path
Download the plugin file from the current MataNet connection
The malware authors call their infrastructure MataNet. For covert communication, they
employ TLS1.2 connections with the help of the “openssl-1.1.0f” open source library,
which is statically linked inside this module. Additionally, the traffic between MataNet
nodes is encrypted with a random RC4 session key. MataNet implements both client and
server mode. In server mode the certificate file “c_2910.cls” and the private key file
“k_3872.cls” are loaded for TLS encryption. However, this mode is never used.

The MataNet client establishes periodic connections with its C2. Every message has a 12byte-long header, where the first DWORD is the message ID and the rest is the auxiliary
data, as described in the table below:
Message
ID

Description

0x400

Complete the current MataNet session and delay the next session until the
number of logical drives is changed or a new active user session is started.

0x500

Delete configuration registry key and stop MATA execution until next reboot.

0x601

Send configuration data to C2.

0x602

Download and set new configuration data.

0x700

Send the C2 the infected host basic information such as victim ID, internal
version number, Windows version, computer name, user name, IP address
and MAC address.

0x701

Send the C2 the configuration settings such as victim ID, internal version
number and session timeout.

The main functionality of the orchestrator is loading each plugin file and executing them
in memory. Each DLL file type plugin provides an interface for the orchestrator and
provides rich functionality that can control infected machines.
Plugin name

Description

MATA_Plug_Cmd.dll

Run “cmd.exe /c” or “powershell.exe” with the specified parameters,
and receive the output of the command execution.

MATA_Plug_Process.dll

Manipulate process (listing process, killing process, creating process,
creating process with logged-on user session ID).

MATA_Plug_TestConnect.dll

Check TCP connection with given IP:port or IP range.
Ping given host or IP range.

MATA_Plug_WebProxy.dll

Create a HTTP proxy server. The server listens for incoming TCP connections on the specified port, processing CONNECT requests from
clients to the HTTP server and forwarding all traffic between client
and server.

MATA_Plug_File.dll

Manipulate files (write received data to given file, send given file after
LZNT1 compression, compress given folder to
%TEMP%\~DESKTOP[8random hex].ZIP and send, wipe given file,
search file, list file and folder, timestomping file).

MATA_Plug_Load.dll

Inject DLL file into the given process using PID and process name, or
inject XORed DLL file into given process, optionally call export function with arguments.

MATA_Plug_P2PReverse.dll

Connect between MataNet server on one side and an arbitrary TCP
server on the other, then forward traffic between them. IPs and ports
for both sides are specified on the call to this interface.

There is an interesting string inside the MATA_Plug_WebProxy plugin – “Proxy-agent:
matt-dot-net” – which is a reference to Matt McKnight’s open source project. There are
some differences though. Matt’s project is written in C# rather than C++. The MATA
proxy is noticeably simpler, as there is no cache and no SSL support, for instance. It’s
possible that MATA’s authors found and used the source code of an early version of Matt’s
proxy server. It looks like the malware author rewrote the code from C# to C++ but left
this footprint unchanged.

Non-Windows version of MATA
The MATA framework targets not only the Windows system but also Linux and macOS
systems.

Linux version
During our research, we also found a package containing different MATA files together
with a set of hacking tools. In this case, the package was found on a legitimate
distribution site, which might indicate that this is the way the malware was distributed. It
included a Windows MATA orchestrator, a Linux tool for listing folders, scripts for
exploiting Atlassian Confluence Server (CVE-2019-3396), a legitimate socat tool and a
Linux version of the MATA orchestrator bundled together with a set of plugins. Chinabased security vendor Netlab also published a highly detailed blog on this malware.
The module is designed to run as a daemon. Upon launch, the module checks if it is
already running by reading the PID from “/var/run/init.pid” and checks if the
“/proc/%pid%/cmdline” file content is equal to “/flash/bin/mountd”. Note that
“/flash/bin/mountd” is an unusual path for standard Linux desktop or server
installations. This path suggests that MATA’s Linux targets are diskless network devices
such as routers, firewalls or IoT devices based on x86_64. The module can be run with
the “/pro” switch to skip the “init.pid” check. The AES-encrypted configuration is stored

in the “$HOME/.memcache” file. The behavior of this module is the same as the
Windows MATA orchestrator previously described. The plugin names of Linux MATA and
the corresponding Windows plugins are:
Linux plugin

Corresponding Windows plugin

/bin/bash

MATA_Plug_Cmd

plugin_file

MATA_Plug_File

plugin_process

MATA_Plug_Process

plugin_test

MATA_Plug_TestConnect

plugin_reverse_p2p

MATA_Plug_P2PReverse

Note that the Linux version of MATA has a logsend plugin. This plugin implements an
interesting new feature, a “scan” command that tries to establish a TCP connection on
ports 8291 (used for administration of MikroTik RouterOS devices) and 8292
(“Bloomberg Professional” software) and random IP addresses excluding addresses
belonging to private networks. Any successful connection is logged and sent to the C2.
These logs might be used by attackers for target selection.

macOS version
We discovered another MATA malware target for macOS uploaded to VirusTotal on April
8, 2020. The malicious Apple Disk Image file is a Trojanized macOS application based on
an open-source two-factor authentication application named MinaOTP.

Trojanized macOS application
The Trojanized main TinkaOTP module is responsible for moving the malicious Mach-O
file to the Library folder and executing it using the following command:
cp TinkaOTP.app/Contents/Resources/Base.lproj/SubMenu.nib ~/Library/.mina >

MATA: Multi-platform targeted malware framework | Securelist

/dev/null 2>&1 && chmod +x ~/Library/.mina > /dev/null 2>&1 && ~/Library/.mina >
/dev/null 2>&1
Upon launch, this malicious Mach-o file loads the initial configuration file from
“/Library/Caches/com.apple.appstotore.db”.
Like another strain running on a different platform, the macOS MATA malware also runs
on a plugin basis. Its plugin list is almost identical to the Linux version, except that it also
contains a plugin named “plugin_socks”. The “plugin_socks” plugin is similar to
“plugin_reverse_p2p” and is responsible for configuring proxy servers.

Victims
Based on our telemetry, we have been able to identify several victims who were infected
by the MATA framework. The infection is not restricted to a specific territory. Victims
were recorded in Poland, Germany, Turkey, Korea, Japan and India. Moreover, the actor
compromised systems in various industries, including a software development company,
an e-commerce company and an internet service provider.
We assess that MATA was used by an APT actor, and from one victim we identified one of
their intentions. After deploying MATA malware and its plugins, the actor attempted to
find the victim’s databases and execute several database queries to acquire customer lists.
We’re not sure if they completed the exfiltration of the customer database, but it’s certain
that customer databases from victims are one of their interests. In addition, MATA was
used to distribute VHD ransomware to one victim, something that will be described in
detail in an upcoming blog post.

Attribution
We assess that the MATA framework is linked to the Lazarus APT group. The MATA
orchestrator uses two unique filenames, c_2910.cls and k_3872.cls, which have only
previously been seen in several Manuscrypt variants, including the samples
(0137f688436c468d43b3e50878ec1a1f) mentioned in the US-CERT publication.

Unique file name
Moreover, MATA uses global configuration data including a randomly generated session
ID, date-based version information, a sleep interval and multiple C2s and C2 server
addresses. We’ve seen that one of the Manuscrypt variants
(ab09f6a249ca88d1a036eee7a02cdd16) shares a similar configuration structure with the
MATA framework. This old Manuscrypt variant is an active backdoor that has similar
configuration data such as session ID, sleep interval, number of C2 addresses, infected
date, and C2 addresses. They are not identical, but they have a similar structure.

Manuscrypt configuration structure

Conclusion
The MATA framework is significant in that it is able to target multiple platforms:
Windows, Linux and macOS. In addition, the actor behind this advanced malware
framework utilized it for a type of cybercrime attack that steals customer databases and
distributes ransomware. We evaluate that this malware is going to evolve, so we will be
monitoring its activity in order to protect our customers.
