Introduction
This Threat Analysis from the SecureWorks CTUSM provides a brief overview of the current
version of ZeuS and its modules, along with the market pricing. We will then see how ZeuS is
actively being used and the irony of how the criminals themselves can sometimes be the
victims.
ZeuS is a well-known banking Trojan horse program, also known as crimeware. This trojan
steals data from infected computers via web browsers and protected storage. Once infected,
the computer sends the stolen data to a bot command and control (C&C) server, where the
data is stored.
ZeuS is sold in the criminal underground as a kit for around $3000-4000, and is likely the one
malware most utilized by criminals specializing in financial fraud. ZeuS has evolved over time
and includes a full arsenal of information stealing capabilities:
Steals data submitted in HTTP forms
Steals account credentials stored in the Windows Protected Storage
Steals client-side X.509 public key infrastructure (PKI) certificates
Steals FTP and POP account credentials
Steals/deletes HTTP and Flash cookies
Modifies the HTML pages of target websites for information stealing purposes
Redirects victims from target web pages to attacker controlled ones
Takes screenshots and scrapes HTML from target sites
Searches for and uploads files from the infected computer
Modifies the local hosts file (%systemroot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts)
Downloads and executes arbitrary programs
Deletes crucial registry keys, rendering the computer unable to boot into Windows

Zeus Author Protects Code with Hardware-Based Licensing System
1/13

The latest version of ZeuS as of this date is 1.3.4.x and is privately sold. The author has
gone to great lengths to protect this version using a Hardware-based Licensing System. The
author of Zeus has created a hardware-based licensing system for the Zeus Builder kit that
you can only run on one computer. Once you run it, you get a code from the specific
computer, and then the author gives you a key just for that computer. This is the first time we
have seen this level of control for malware.

Zeus Versions
The version number breakdown is as follows (from the ZeuS manual):
What do the numbers [signify] in the version?
a.b.c.d
a(1) - a complete change in the bot. This has never changed from 1.
b(3) - Major changes that cause complete or partial incompatibility with the previous
versions. Recently we moved from version 2 to version 3.
c(2) - This is for bug fixes, improvements, and adding features.
d(1) - This for a small revision in the code to make the malware undetectable by AV vendors.
The latest public version the CTU has encountered is 1.2.7.19. This version is actively being
traded and has the Firefox form grabber module enabled. The Firefox module allows the
ZeuS trojan to grab data out of any forms completed on the Firefox web browser. The
webinjects text file, which allows for the injection of fields into the Internet Explorer (IE) web
browser, does not work with Firefox and only works with IE. The function of the webinjects
text file is to display an extra field for a victim to complete when they log onto a banking site
(see Figures 1 and 2). The extra field asks for data in addition to the username and
password. This technique is similar to phishing, but the extra field is not part of the original
site.
The current list of modules that work with ZeuS are as follows:
Zeus Kit for Version 1.3.4.x ($3,000 to $4,000)
The Private Version of the Zeus Kit is running between $3,000 and $4,000. The latest
private version of ZeuS, as of this date, is 1.3.4.x. This private version seems to be
only sold by the author, and he is protecting all of its functionality through the hardware
l I.D., locking which we mentioned previously.
Backconnect $1500
The backconnect module allows an attacker to 'connect back' to the infected computer
and make financial transactions from it. This way, banks that try to track where money
transfers originate will always trace it back to the computer of the account holder.

2/13

Firefox form grabber $2000
The Firefox form grabber module grabs data out of fields that are submitted using the
Firefox web browser. This data can include personally identifiable information (PII) as
well as usernames and passwords for bank accounts, trading accounts, online
payment accounts, and anything else that would require the use of a username and
password.
Jabber (IM) chat notifier $500
The Jabber module allows an attacker to receive stolen data in "real time". If a bank
account is being protected with a token that generates random numbers, then the
attacker can access the victim's account in real time after the victim logs in using the
token. An example of what would be sent via the Jabber module is:
Request Type :Domestic Wire
Name :John Smith
Address :1234 Main Street
City :Atlanta GA 12345
Payee Name :Some Bank
Memo :Credit to acc:1111111111
Beneficiary Account :Checking #0000001234
Beneficiary Address 1 :Georgia
Payee Bank ID :0123456
Bank Name :Some Bank
Addr1 :Atlanta Some Bank
Amount :1500000.00
From Account :My Money Market #123456789
Date Posted :01/01/10
Time Posted :2:00 PM

VNC (Virtual Network Computing) private module $10,000
The VNC module is similar to the backconnect module, except that it allows you to establish
a fully functioning virtual connection. The attacker can take control of the infected computer
without the victim being aware of it. Essentially, the VNC provides the hacker with not just a
Network Proxy but with a Total Presence Proxy (it is the total package), allowing the hacker
to use all of the victim's hardware and software, including its browser, so as to avoid a bank's
fraud detection systems. Essentially, it allows the hacker to get around many hardwarebased authentication systems. Additionally, if the victim is doing large dollar transactions and
is required to insert a smartcard into their computer that the bank will recognize, the hacker
will have access to that smartcard via the VNC module.

Windows 7/Vista Support $2000
3/13

This module allows the ZeuS trojan to infect these Windows 7 and Vista systems. Without it,
the botnet controller is limited to Windows XP systems.

ZeuS 1.4 Adds Polymorphic Encryption and Web Injects for Firefox
The authors of ZeuS are currently developing 1.4 which is being beta tested. It includes two
key components which make the ZeuS Banking Trojan even more stealthy and
comprehensive, due to its ability to also do web injects for the Firefox browser. The
components are:
1. Web Injects for Firefox
2. Polymorphic Encryption: The 1.4 version of ZeuS will enable the ZeuS Trojan to reencrypt itself each time it infects a victim, thus making each infection unique. The 1.4
version also enables the ZeuS file names to be randomly generated, thus each
infection will contain different file names. This will make it very difficult for anti-virus
engines to identify the ZeuS Banking Trojan on the victims' system.

How Zeus Works
ZeuS performs stolen data exfiltration and remote commands via encrypted HTTP POST
requests to a Command and Control web server. The encryption ZeuS uses is RC4, with a
key that is embedded in the binary. While the primary function of this malware is to commit
financial fraud, its general information stealing behaviors make it a threat to all enterprises.
Basic credential theft is not targeted, meaning the ZeuS botnet controller does not run the
botnet to just see what it can get. The botnet controller usually has a financial target in mind.
The criminals typically search for data of interest to directly derive value or to sell the data to
another criminal.
Several of these tasks can be done "on-demand" via the HTTP-based control panel, and
directed to selected infected computers. These on-demand tasks may be performed via
special scripts that can be executed on select systems. These scripts can be used to take
screenshots of infected systems or to do ZeuS binary updates.

new fields.
ZeuS includes these capabilities to assist with automated clearing house (ACH) fraud. ACH
is an electronic network for financial transactions in the United States. It is used for online bill
payments, payroll direct deposits from employers and to transfer money from one account to
another. ZeuS is aimed at taking advantage of ACH to transfer money to criminal accounts.

How to detect the ZeuS Banking Trojan on your computer
5/13

Computers infected with this version of ZeuS will have the following files and folders
installed. The location depends on whether the victim has Administrator rights. The files will
most likely have the HIDDEN attribute set to hide them from casual inspection.
With Administrator rights:
%systemroot%\system32\sdra64.exe (malware)
%systemroot%\system32\lowsec
%systemroot%\system32\lowsec\user.ds (encrypted stolen data file)
%systemroot%\system32\lowsec\user.ds.lll (temporary file for stolen data)
%systemroot%\system32\lowsec\local.ds (encrypted configuration file)

Without Administrator rights:
%appdata%\sdra64.exe
%appdata%\lowsec
%appdata%\lowsec\user.ds
%appdata%\lowsec\user.ds.lll
%appdata%\lowsec\local.ds

ZeuS also makes registry changes to ensure that it starts up with Administrator privileges:
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon
From:
"Userinit" = "C:\WINDOWS\system32\userinit.exe"
To:
"Userinit" =
"C:\WINDOWS\system32\userinit.exe,C:\WINDOWS\system32\sdra64.exe"

Without Administrator rights:
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
Add:
"Userinit" = "C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;user&gt;\Application Data\sdra64.exe"

The sdra64.exe program uses process injection to hide its presence in the list of running
processes. Upon startup, it will inject code into winlogon.exe (if Administrator rights
available) or explorer.exe (for non-Administrators) and exit. The injected code infects other
processes to perform its data theft capabilities.

Types of data being targeted by ZeuS
6/13

The following figures illustrate what type of data is stolen and collected from infected
computers. The list of infected systems shown in Figure 3 can range from the hundreds to
thousands. The number of infected systems usually depends on how long the botnet is
active and how well the bot controller spreads the malware.

Figure 3. List of infected systems. Each system is a folder on the C&C server.

Figure 4. Sample of collected information from an infected system for a social networking
site.
Figure 4 illustrates a fragment of information collected from an infected system.
This listing begins with the bot id, which is usually the name of the affected computer.
Next is the name of the botnet that includes the affected computer. Also listed is the bot
version.
Next appears the IPv4 IP address of the affected computer and the country it belongs
to. This information is not always accurate because a host with an internal IP will not
display correctly.
Further down the list appears the OS.
7/13

This log was captured from an Internet Explorer web browser used to visit a popular
social networking website.
ZeuS captured the language used, full page parameters, email address, password, and
anything else that was being generated from the login attempt.

Figure 5. Sample of banking information collected from an infected system.
Figure 5 is similar in function to the previous listing, but this time ZeuS is stealing the login
information for a bank account. Figure 6 shows the same user transferring money from
checking to savings. These examples demonstrate the risks that infected computers and
their users are susceptible to.

Figure 6. Sample of banking transaction information collected from an infected system.

8/13

Figure 7. PFX (PKCS #12) Digital Certificate file collected from an infected system.
ZeuS even steals PFX (PKCS #12) Digital Certificates that the victim's web browser uses to
authenticate to a site (Figure 7). So the victim is still vulnerable if their banking site uses
assigned certificates.

Figure 8. ZeuS server control panel, operating system statistics.
Figure 8 shows a ZeuS server using the 1.2.4.2 version control panel. The screen displays
totals of the bots and what OS version they are running, the most popular being Windows XP
Professional SP3. This ZeuS bot also infected Vista users, which means the bot controller
paid extra for the Vista/Windows 7 module.

9/13

Figure 9. ZeuS server control panel, statistics summary.
Figure 9 shows the same botnet, listing bots by country. It lists the most prevalent country as
BG (Bulgaria), but according to reports from bot operators, this value is not accurate
because ZeuS could not determine the country listing from internal IP addresses. Note that
this botnet has 1,827 infected computers (bots) in it and has logged 551,492 reports.

Stolen ZeuS data cache
Now we will take a look at how botnet data gets stolen and leaked. Figure 10 shows a botnet
controller looking for a partner for his ZeuS botnet.

Figure 10. Message from botnet controller looking for business partner.
Now his ZeuS server gets hacked and the database is posted online. The download contains
the entire database plus the server-side ZeuS PHP files. The attacker is even happy enough
to tell you what server he got it from.

Data Stolen by ZeuS
The total size of the PHP files for the ZeuS server is 20MB, and the stolen database is
900MB. The database contained login credentials from 1,827 victims located in the US, UK,
Canada, Europe, etc. These login credentials were for banking, stock trading, credit union,
online payment, insurance, social networking, government, and military accounts. The bank
account, credit union, stock trading, and online payment credentials were for many large and
medium sized institutions in the US, UK and Canada.

11/13

Figure 12. Message listing account credentials from the ZeuS database.
Figure 12 shows the same user posting account usernames and passwords to try to prove
that there is valuable data in the stolen ZeuS database file.

12/13

Figure 13. Message explaining how to import the ZeuS database in MySQL.
The same user then gives details on how to import the database into a MySQL server so that
anyone can start sorting through the data. He also gives the username and password for the
login. Figure 13 mentions the same person that was looking for a partner in Figure 10. The
CTU has observed other ZeuS databases for sale on various underground black markets.
Their size is typically over 10GB, which is a botnet of approximately 23,000 infected
computers (bots).

How to Protect Yourself from ZeuS
The CTU recommends that businesses and home users carry out online banking and
financial transactions on isolated workstations that are not used for general Internet
activities, such as web browsing and reading email which could increase the risk of infection.
Businesses may even consider using an alternative operating system for workstations
accessing sensitive or financial accounts. Keep your antivirus, operating system and
software patches up to date. Also do not open suspicious e-mail attachments or links from
people that you do not know and even if you do know them, check with them to find out if
they sent you something prior to opening the email. Additionally, awareness for both
customers and employees is crucial. In particular, employees who interface with clients
should be made aware of these types of threats to help triage potential victims.
