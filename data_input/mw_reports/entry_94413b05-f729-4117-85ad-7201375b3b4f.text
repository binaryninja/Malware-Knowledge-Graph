RiskIQ collaborated with Proofpoint Cyber Security on research for a report published today
investigating the activities of North Korea’s Lazarus Group, which highlights the group’s
recent focus on cryptocurrency investors and exchanges. Earlier this year, the activities of
the Lazarus group in South Korea were discussed and analyzed, as they managed to
compromise accounts on various South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges. More recently,
they were seen targeting a United Kingdom-based cryptocurrency exchange. In this blog, we
will show and explain our analysis of the infrastructure used in the cyber attack described in
the Proofpoint report.

The Start: Lazarus Group's IDN Phishing for Infections
In early November, Proofpoint uncovered a large active phishing campaign that sent out
messages about fake Bitcoin Gold (BTG) wallet software. The actors abused IDN registration
attempting to impersonate the official bitcoingold.org website using sender IDN domains and

the decoded notations. Below are four examples of domain names registered for this
campaign:
IDN version

Decoded version

xn--bitcoingod-8yb.com

bitcoingou013ed.com

xn--bitcoigold-o1b.com

bitcoiu0146gold.com

xn--bitcoingld-lcb.org

bitcoingu00f6ld.org

xn--bitcingold-hcb.org

bitcu00f6ingold.org

The domains shown above appeared in our crawl data, meaning we had a full copy of the
webpage and any metadata present on it. We’ll take a look at xn--bitcingold-hcb.org which, in
our data, looked identical to the genuine site:

Above, the fake page set up by the Lazarus group is on the left. Note the download button
and pushed down ‘Roadmap button,' which do not appear on the official site on the right,
which has a logo and roadmap button instead. The actors copied the index page from the
official Bitcoingold website and modified it, but they still link to the CSS, Javascript, and
image resources of the official website, which we can see in the source of the page:

The information above is really valuable to our investigation. As RiskIQ stores host pairs for
sites that point to each other in a parent or child relationship. We can call upon this data set
for the official Bitcoingold website and see at least two of the fake websites in its parent Host
Pair set:

Note: We filtered on parent relationships to see hosts that pointed to bitcoingold.org, not
hosts bitcoingold linked to itself.
As reported by Proofpoint, the "download" button linked to a backdoored PyInstaller
installation that was set up to download a version of the PowerRatankba implant. The button
was linked via an onclick event to a JavaScript function:

The invoked script redirects the user to the file download:

The file downloaded here was seen with the following SHA256 hash:
eab612e333baaec0709f3f213f73388607e495d8af9a2851f352481e996283f1
Besides Bitcoingold, the Lazarus group performed the same kind of IDN ‘attack’ against the
Electrum Bitcoin wallet website. The actors created the IDN website, xn--electrm-s2a.org, to
serve as a fake software installation page similar to the Bitcoingold clone:

Interestingly, Lazarus left some information in the source of the page that shows that they
used the ‘HTTrack’ website copier tool, as well as the date (Friday, November 17th at
03:27:29 GMT as per our crawl data) they copied the Electrum website:

Conclusions
Defenders with access to internet data collected by crawlers can detect unknown threats at
the source and track how they change and spread. Correlating threat data extracted from a
broad set of data sources across channels reveals the risk posed to an organization by a
single piece of infrastructure—and how it’s used within a broader context. As can be seen
from the above analysis, RiskIQ’s crawling infrastructure, indexed web data sets, and
analyst-focused analysis platform allows organizations to quickly and effectively identify the
scale of these strategic compromises and provide visibility that improves an organization’s
ability to defend their network.
Interested in crawling specific parts of the Internet with RiskIQ technology? Now you can
task our virtual users to work for you at scale. RiskIQ offers URL crawling through our
Security Intelligence Services (SIS), so you can capture the same kind of data we used in
this post. For more information and a quote, contact us today.

Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
The following IOCs are those found by pivoting around the known hosts from the phishing
emails and expanding our list this way. We have some suspected hosts that are potentially
related to this campaign, but we don’t have proof (yet), these are not listed, but we will keep
an eye out for any confirmed activity.
Below list does not include IOCs obtained from Proofpoint’s malware analysis, those are
available in their report or from the full list of IOCs is available in our RiskIQ Community
