VPNFilter-affected Devices Still Riddled with 19 Bugs
blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/vpnfilter-affected-devices-still-riddled-with-19-vulnerabilities
July 13, 2018

Our IoT scanning tool allows users to identify if connected devices (e.g. routers, network
attached storage devices, IP cameras, and printers) in a given network are vulnerable to
security risks and vulnerabilities, such as those related to Mirai, Reaper, and WannaCry.
We gather our data from the Trend Micro™ Home Network Security solution and
HouseCall™ for Home Networks scanner. HouseCall for Home Networks is a free tool that
features device recognition and vulnerability scanning in users' networks and connected
devices. Home Network Security is a solution plugged into users’ routers that protects
connected devices from potential cyberattacks. Our scanning can cover multiple operating
systems, including Linux, Mac, Windows, Android, iOS, and other software development kit
(SDK) platforms.
This blog tackles the recently ill-famed VPNFilter malware and if deployed devices are
vulnerable to it and other vulnerabilities. VPNFilter is a newly discovered, multi-stage
malware (detected by Trend Micro as ELF_VPNFILT.A, ELF_VPNFILT.B, ELF_VPNFILT.C,
and ELF_VPNFILT.D) that affects many models of connected devices. Initially reported at the
tail end of May to have infected at least 500,000 networking devices across 54 countries,
including those from Linksys, MikroTik, Netgear, and TP-Link, to steal website credentials
and even render devices unusable, the malware is now seen targeting more devices to

deliver exploits and even override reboots. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has
even released a public service announcement (PSA), warning that it is the work of foreign
threat actors looking to compromise networked devices worldwide.

Different brands and models affected by VPNFilter and more
VPNFilter is known to affect over ten brands and 70 models of devices. Our IoT scanning
tool can identify other publicly known vulnerabilities targeting the devices as listed below:

Table 1. Some of the known affected devices by VPNFilter
Based on our data from June 1 to July 12, plenty of the devices are still using old firmware
versions. In fact, 19 known vulnerabilities, not only taken advantage of by VPNFilter but other
malware as well, can still be detected in devices up to this day.
2/5

At the time of our scanning, we observed that 34 percent of home networks had at least one
device with a known vulnerability. We found that 9 percent of vulnerable devices are
potentially affected by VPNFilter.

Table 2. 19 vulnerability detections on VPNFilter-affected devices
As expected, the 19 vulnerabilities primarily affect routers. Interestingly, the Authentication
Bypass Vulnerability CVE-2015-7261, an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) flaw in the QNAP NAS
firmware, mostly affects printers based on our detection. While determining the possible
reason behind this, we found that many of the detected printers’ FTP could connect to the
network without any authentication. In some cases, this may be the printer’s default
configuration, but it still poses a potential security risk if the FTP is set as open on the
internet.

The other vulnerabilities detected, such as the Buffer Overflow CVE-2013-0229 and Stack
Overflow CVE-2013-0230, can allow attackers to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) and
execute arbitrary code in systems, respectively. Vulnerable UPnP Services detected,
moreover, aren’t exclusively associated with Netgear/TP-Link/D-Link devices, as other
brands could also have the same vulnerability. In that case, we can expect more detections.

Protecting devices and networks against VPNFilter malware and other
vulnerabilities
The threat of VPNFilter malware is augmented by the fact that other publicly known
vulnerabilities were detected in the affected devices. Since not all device manufacturers
provide immediate fixes for discovered vulnerabilities and not all users regularly apply
patches, users should first secure the way they set up their devices and networks. Trend
Micro™ Home Network Security solution can check internet traffic between the router and all
connected devices. Our IoT scanning tool has been integrated into the Home Network
Security solution and HouseCall™ for Home Networks scanner. Enterprises can also monitor
all ports and network protocols for advanced threats and thwart targeted attacks with the
Trend Micro™ Deep Discovery™ Inspector network appliance.
Aside from adopting security solutions that can protect networks and connected devices from
the vulnerabilities through the identification and assessment of potential risks, we
recommend standard security measures, such as:
Updating the firmware versions of devices once they’re available to avoid attacks that
exploit known vulnerabilities.
Avoiding the use of public Wi-Fi on devices that are also used in home or corporate
networks.
Changing device’s default credentials and using strong passwords to deter
unauthorized access.
Being wary of suspicious URLs or attachments from unknown sources that may lead to
infecting devices connected to the network.
