In January 2021, PwC observed a phishing page that prompted an investigation into a new threat actor we now call ‘White
Tur’. Per our in-house naming convention for threat actors, the use of the colour 'White' indicates that we have not yet
formally attributed White Tur as being based in a specific geographic location.
Our journey began when hunting for newly registered domains with TLS certificates that use the term ‘qov’, spoofing the
legitimate term ‘gov’. Spoofing the word ‘gov’ has previously been a favoured technique of several unrelated threat actors,
such as Blue Athena (a.k.a. Sofacy, APT28)1. On 31st January 2021, we observed the subdomain mail[.]mod[.]qov[.]rs being
used to phish for Serbian Ministry of Defence credentials. The phishing page shown in Figure 1 when visited not only logged
credentials, but logged visits to the phishing page itself.

When tracking domain registrations and domain resolutions to White Tur attributed infrastructure, we observed it to be a
persistent threat actor operating over a number of years, from at least 2017 through to 2021, as shown in Figure 2.

The techniques used by White Tur included:
Weaponised documents - Ranging from documents containing macros to exploits such as CVE-2017-0199;
HTA scripts - Scripts that lead to the execution of PowerShell were often observed being used as an alternative to
weaponised documents as an initial infection vector;
XSL Scripts - Used inside weaponised documents to execute a payload. From our observations the XSL scripts can be
used to execute a JScript or Windows binary backdoor;
PowerShell Scripts - Part of the infection chain to download and execute the final payload;
JScript - One of the backdoors used by White Tur was developed in JScript (One of the interpreted languages used in
Windows Script Host);
Windows binaries - Another backdoor used by White Tur was packaged as a Windows binary; and,
Phishing - Phishing activity with governmental, defence, research and development and telecommunications themes.

This blog is focused on our analysis of White Tur’s use of the open-source project OpenHardwareMonitor for payload
execution. This project monitors temperature sensors, fan speeds, voltage and load and clock speeds of a computer2. We
observed an archive named OpenHardwareMonitor-revised.zip with patterns we commonly associate with White Tur.

Analysis
After analysing the contents of the ZIP file, we assessed that White Tur was likely packaging the OpenHardwareMonitor
project and backdooring parts of it to execute its payloads. There were three files that White Tur had modified or created
inside the archive, listed in Table 1.

PowerShell
downloader

OpenHardwareMonitorLib.csproj
In the file OpenHardwareMonitorLib.csproj, White Tur modified the file to inject PowerShell code into the pre-build event,
available in Visual Studio projects. This technique for gaining execution was discussed by Microsoft in January 2021, when
they observed the North Korea-based threat actor ZINC (which we track as Black Artemis) using this method3. The
PowerShell code retrieves environmental information from the victim using PowerShell WMI objects and utilises the
BitsTransfer Module available in PowerShell to download a payload shown in Figure 3. The payload is downloaded and
copied to \APPDATA\Local\Microsoft\OneDrive\WOFUTIL.dll - this filename has been observed in previous White Tur activity.4
Figure 3 - PowerShell code contained in the PreBuildEvent tag
The PowerShell script will generate a unique ID for the infected machine and name it a ‘UUID’. This unique identifier is sent to
the C2 when the payload is downloaded through the URL:
hxxp[:]//onedrive-login[.]us/download.php?uuid=<unique_ID>

CWRITE.ps1
2/6

CWRITE.ps1 is a PowerShell downloader script; however, unlike the prebuild event, it uses a different technique for C2
communication and logs environmental information to a separate IP. The PowerShell script sends environmental information
to the following URL via BitsTransfer:
hxxp[:]//193.37.213[.]135/BitsData/
The PowerShell script will then download the payload to the same folder via the same URL as the previous script:
hxxp[:]//onedrive-login[.]us/download.php?uuid=<unique_ID>
However, its method for communication has been modified; in this sample, the PowerShell script initiates a COM object,
specifically XML HTTP 3.05. The script uses the .Open() method to send a HTTP request shown in Figure 4.

Command.dat
The binary command.dat is a DLL that contains exports previously observed in White Tur payloads. These exports are:
GetAdaptersAddresses;
GetAdaptersInfo;
GetLoaderInterface; and,
GetTeamViewerInterface.
The payload correctly functions by executing the default DLL entry point, DllEntrypoint. PwC assesses White Tur likely uses
the name WOFUTIL.dll for payloads in a DLL search order hijacking attack. The Windows binary
OneDriveStandAloneUpdater.exe is vulnerable to DLL side order hijacking and loads the DLL WOFUTIL.dll6. The DLL also
makes use of the BitsTransfer COM objects, it calls CoCreateInstance with class identifiers (CLSIDs) related to the
BitsTransfer control class shown in Figure 5.
Figure 5 - Malware utilising BitsTransfer control class COM objects
Like the PowerShell scripts, the Windows binary will generate a unique identifier for the victim. This is achieved by
dynamically loading the library RPCRT4.dll and calling UuidCreateSequential(). The malware will use the following URL with
the BitsTransfer COM object for C2 communication:
hxxp[:]//onedrive-login[.]us/tp/reply.php
From our observations, this is the most functional backdoor we have observed from White Tur which is capable of:
File management;
Upload and download of files;
Execution of commands; and,
Set malware sleep time.
However, White Tur has been experimenting with malware development and open-source projects. For example, we identify
an open-source malware project name present on the command.dat PDB path. “Storm Kitty” is an open-source C# stealer
used to capture credentials and keylogs by the victim.
C:\Users\tensho\Desktop\StormKitty-master\Cameleon\Release\Cameleon.pdb
This threat actor uses several techniques often observed by a wide variety of threats actors, such as DLL search order
hijacking, phishing and use of COM objects. The unique feature this threat actor has is its victimology, targeting defence,
governmental and research organisations based in Serbia and Republika Srpska. The full infection chain we observed with
this technique is shown in Figure 6.

Attribution

3/6

We are still in the technical phases of attribution with this threat actor; if we refer to the 4C model7 of attribution phases we are
currently at the clustering phase. With some threat actors it is clear there are links to other APTs. However, from our
assessment, this particular threat actor has a range of motivations with no clear links to well-known threat actors which are
attributed to a government or organisation.
The threat actor focuses attacks on a region where there is little coverage in threat intelligence blogs, in this blog we aim to
encourage some public dialogue about who would want to backdoor OpenHardwareMonitor and target these regions? This
blog complements a talk presented at the SANS CTI Summit on 27th January 2021, which explores the wider context of this
technical analysis.
