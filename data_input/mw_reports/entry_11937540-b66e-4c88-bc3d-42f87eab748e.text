Despite multiple arrests and the conviction of several members of the notorious cybercrime
gang, FIN7 [1][2] (a.k.a. Carbanak Group), the group continues to develop its business
model and toolset throughout 2021 [3]. During the first week of June 2021, eSentire’s Threat
Response Unit (TRU) witnessed an opportunistic malspam campaign that was conducted by
the FIN7 group. The criminal group used a fake legal complaint centering around BrownForman Inc. Brown-Forman is a large, U.S.-based wine and spirits company and the maker
of the popular Jack Daniels whisky. (Figures 1 and 2). On June 10, external researchers
observed a USPS mail delivery notification lure (Figure3). It was associated with the same
infrastructure set as the legal complaint lure. Toward the end of June, a ProofPoint
researcher documented a Windows 11 lure used to deliver JSSLoader.
One of the victims of the malicious legal complaint campaign was a law firm. The lure
successfully bypassed the law firm’s email filters, and it was not detected as suspicious by
any of the firm’s employees. eSentire’s TRU team identified the malicious document through
threat hunting activities.

The initial stage of the malware arrives as an Excel attachment, which downloads and
executes a variant of the JSSLoader Remote Access Trojan (RAT). The variant has been
reported as being used by the FIN7 group [3]. The malicious Excel document leverages
Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to install the RAT. Once installed, JSSLoader
provides the threat group with a backdoor to the victim’s computer and the organization.

FIN7 Objectives
FIN7 is a financially motivated cybercrime group which gained notoriety for stealing millions
of credit card numbers from businesses around the world. One security research team
reported that the crime group stole more than a billion dollars between 2015 and 2018 from
companies globally. U.S. federal law officials filed court documents on June 17, 2021 stating
that FIN7 had more than 70 members, all assigned to various departments under the larger
organization. The court documents went on to say that the FIN7 leaders would organize their
personnel into different teams. These teams are tasked with creating malware, crafting
phishing documents and collecting money from compromised victims. As for the U.S. victims,
court officials stated that the group went after hundreds of U.S. companies infecting
organizations ranging from the burrito chain Chipotle and the department store Saks Fifth
Avenue. FIN7 is one of many cyber gangs observed participating in Magecart attacks [4].
Magecart is a consortium of malicious hacker groups who target online shopping cart
systems, such as the Magento system, to steal customer payment card information.

FIN7 has also been associated with the Ryuk ransomware group[5]. In December 2020,
security researchers at Trusec observed an attacker use the tools and techniques of FIN7 to
gain a foothold into an enterprise. In a second attack against the company, almost six weeks
later, that same foothold was used to launch Ryuk ransomware into the victim’s environment.
The Truesec researchers stated that this was the first instance where they had observed a
combination of FIN7 tools and the RYUK ransomware. Until this incident, they said they had
never seen FIN7 associated with ransomware attacks. The TRU has also never observed a
connection between FIN7 and the Ryuk ransomware group. Truesec theorized “it was
possible FIN7 simply sold the access to the Ryuk group, but it is probable that FIN7 and the
Ryuk gang are more closely affiliated and may be part of the same organized crime network.”
[5]. No matter which theory is correct, this implies that few criminal organizations are out of
scope for FIN7, since ransomware can often monetize intrusions regardless of the industry.
Similar conclusions can be drawn from the recent analysis on the victimology of the Avaddon
ransomware group, which demonstrates a diverse set of victim targets, across business
sectors and revenue volumes [6]. These observations are part of a trend of modern,
financially motivated attacks which implement a threat model that is effective, regardless of
an organization’s industry. If FIN7 cannot make use of an organization they have
compromised, they are likely to participate in the “initial access market,” selling or trading
access to the victim entity with another threat actor or threat group. Those threat actors are
likely to be a ransomware group or its affiliates to monetize the access.

FIN7’s Malicious Spam Campaign Using a Legal Lure Involving
Brown-Forman Inc.
During this attack, the initial email arrives alleging a legal complaint for wine and spirits
company, Brown-Forman, as observed by the TRU team, as well as other researchers [7].
Brown-Forman is one of the largest American-owned spirits and wine companies and among
the top 10 largest global spirits companies.
Several researchers reported this lure, indicating that this was not a single incident, but most
likely an opportunistic spam campaign. Corporate users might immediately suspect a
random legal complaint, that arrives via email, from a large spirits and wine company.
However, law firms deal with legal complaints across industry verticals regularly so the
content would not be considered out of the ordinary. Thus, law firms may be more
susceptible to this topic.

FIN7’s Shifting Lures
On June 10, external researchers observed FIN7 using a USPS-themed email attachment[8].
The USPS lure is more generic and thus, more opportunistic in nature. And as mentioned
previously, during the last week of June, a Proofpoint researcher saw a Windows 11 lure
which led to the JSSLoader.

4/10

Whatever the specific intentions of FIN7, they appear to be actively adjusting their lures to
maximize campaign success. For example, the legal complaint lure hit Internet users’ email
inboxes the first week of June, just one month before settlement claims were due for a class
action suit against Brown-Forman regarding a ransomware breach the company suffered in
August 2020 (Figure 5). The infamous REvil (Sodin) gang took credit for the ransomware
attack. Although the company said they were able to disrupt the attack before their data
could be encrypted, the REvil gang broadcasted on their blog/leak site that they had access
to Brown-Forman’s systems for over a month and stole a terabyte of their company data.
The fact that the TRU spotted FIN7 launching a malicious email campaign in June 2021,
using the Brown-Forman legal complaint as a lure, and it was approximately one month
before claim forms were due from victims (Figure 4.) is coincidental. Whether FIN7 is
connected to the REvil (Sodinokibi) attack against Brown-Forman or whether they are simply
capitalizing on public news regarding the case remains to be seen. In further examining
potential connections between FIN7 and REvil, in August 2020 a Swiss security company
promised to demonstrate connections between the two threat groups in a series of blog
posts [9] but never provided sufficient evidence. It appears that they were left waiting for
confirmation from the ransomware victims [10][11]. Regardless, what we do know for sure is
that cybercriminals use well-timed lures and try to predict the susceptibility of a theme for
their threat campaigns, and they will use lures built around social trends [12], global crises
[13] and routine events [14].

Operating Infrastructure Tying FIN7’s Malicious Email Lures Together

5/10

Figure 4: Infrastructure and malware used in the latest FIN7 campaigns
The most recent lures associated with FIN7 show connections in their supporting
infrastructure. (Figure 3). The servers are observed performing three distinct functions. The
primary download server, observed by TRU, was browm-forman[.]com which served as a
starting point. First stage payloads are fetched from intermediate servers, such as
opposedent[.]com, jurisdictionious[.]com, halfious[.]com, pigeonious[.]com. It is
unclear what role fairedale[.]com plays, though given its position in redirection and
JavaScript management, its role may be to test whether a visiting computer is a susceptible
victim (and not, for example, a security researcher) before redirecting the user to the
malicious payload. The command- and- control domains(C2s), for the first payload, appear to
be unitious[.]com, injuryless[.]com, deprivationant[.]com, jurisdictionient[.]com, and
legislationient[.]com. There is no apparent relationship with the infrastructure reported by
previous research.
Another curious finding is that some infrastructure was not observed by TRU for months
following domain registration. In the incident which leveraged the Brown-Forman lure, the
landing page for the lookalike domain (browm-forman[.]com) was registered 2021-03-11, but
not observed until June. VirusTotal submissions for this domain line up with the June
observations. This gap between registration and operational use might have been to thwart
website reputation filters which utilize domain age as input. This months-long time delta does
not appear to carry over to C2 domains used by the weaponized Excel document and
subsequent JSSLoader payload. Both contacted domains registered May 27th, a week prior
to in- the-wild use.
Finally, TRU observed registration of a new lookalike domain (brown-formam[.]com) on June
9th. While in-the-wild use has not been observed, the registration and TLS certificate patterns
match the previous landing page. We assess this domain will replace the prior one given that
it has been exposed publicly.

Key Takeaways
The following key takeaways have been summarized by Spence Hutchinson, Manager of
Threat Intelligence, eSentire:
Despite several key members of the FIN7 group being incarcerated, the gang
continues to mount successful threat campaigns, indicating that they have numerous
members and extensive recruitment efforts.
Notably for the Brown-Forman case, FIN7 threat actors registered the infrastructure
months before the TRU saw it in action. Either the attackers were using it for months
before eSentire saw the activity, or they weaponized it after a period of time to evade
email filtering by newly registered domains. If that is the case, this shows a degree of
planning and sophistication on the part of FIN7.

6/10

The FIN7 group is very experienced. They have been involved in financial cybercrime
for a long time, and they know how to use social engineering techniques that will lure
computer users. Their success in compromising companies and individuals, via email,
reiterates the importance of continually educating one’s employees and partners to be
on the lookout for malicious email campaigns.
FIN7’s regular shifting of infrastructure and lures is a testament to their knowledge on
how to evade detection by security professionals.
It is plausible that proficient financial cybercrime groups, such as FIN7, are providing
initial access to seasoned ransomware groups, such as REvil (Sodinokibi), Ryuk, etc.
as a way to monetize their access.
