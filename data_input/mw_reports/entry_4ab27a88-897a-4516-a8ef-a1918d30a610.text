in AI and Emerging Technologies Will Shape China’s
Military

Yesterday, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) released its annual report on Chinese
Military Power. The 2021 report demonstrates the growing challenge that China poses to
U.S. interests in the Indo-Pacific and beyond. China’s growing nuclear arsenal has received
most of the media attention. Underneath the headlines, though, is an approach whereby
China seeks to leverage emerging technologies and innovative operational concepts—for
both conventional and strategic operations—to become a leading military through an
approach described as “intelligentized” warfare. According to the report, China “seeks to
dominate technologies associated with the Fourth Industrial Revolution” (p. 145) because it
will help China become a world-class military. Below, we outline critical aspects of China’s
military modernization efforts referenced in the report, focusing particularly on developments
related to defense innovation and emerging technologies.
China Connects Emerging Technology Leadership to Military Capabilities
China believes that emerging technologies will shape and increase the speed of warfare,
meaning future military success will require forces that are “mechanized, informatized, and
intelligentized” (p. 89). The term “intelligentized” describes "the PRC’s concept of future
warfare based on emerging and disruptive technologies, particularly AI” (p. 146). This

includes intelligent technologies, systems, and operational concepts such as “attrition
warfare by intelligent swarms, cross-domain mobile warfare, AI-based space confrontation,
and cognitive control operations,” that facilitate information processing and decision-making
on the battlefield.

China is also updating its doctrine and warfighting plans to incorporate these capabilities.
China's Academy of Military Science (AMS) has a mandate to ensure “that the PLA’s
warfighting theory and doctrine fully capitalize on disruptive technologies like AI and
autonomous systems” (p. 148). Through an emphasis on emerging technologies, China
seeks to become a “global innovation superpower” (p. 145).

These intelligentized capabilities are directly related to China’s potential pursuit of its
strategic interests—namely, capturing Taiwan. While details in the report are limited, it states:
“In 2020, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) announced a new milestone for PLA
modernization in 2027 broadly understood as the modernization of the PLA’s capabilities to
be networked into a system of systems for intelligentized warfare. If realized, the PLA’s 2027
modernization goals could provide Beijing with more credible military options in a Taiwan
contingency” (p. I).
China’s Strategy for Achieving Defense Technology Leadership
China’s mechanism for achieving defense technology leadership, according to the report,
remains civil-military fusion. This is China’s attempt to link technology advances in the private
sector with its military-industrial base. Both U.S. and Chinese officials have argued that key
technologies that will shape the future of warfare, including artificial intelligence (AI), robotics,
quantum, and biotechnology, are fundamentally dual use (or general purpose). The private
sector is driving innovation around the world. For China, the connection between the private
and public sectors will help determine future technological leadership. As the report
describes, “Under Beijing’s MCF strategy, the PLA seeks to exploit China’s private sector
achievements to further its force modernization plans” (p. 147). The report also discusses
other Chinese technology leadership initiatives, such as foreign direct investment to acquire
technology, talent recruitment, academic collaborations for research and development, and
illicit acquisition through espionage.
China’s Priority Areas for Defense Investments in Emerging Technologies
The report highlights (p. 148) specific emerging technologies that China is actively pursuing
and illustrates their potential military applications, as the graphic below shows:

Within the AI and advanced robotics area highlighted in the graphic, an ongoing question is
where and how militaries will use machine learning. The report outlines Chinese investments
in machine learning for areas including tactical and strategic decision support and AI-enabled
wargaming. The report also describes continuing Chinese investments in autonomous air,
ground, and naval systems, some with limited AI capabilities, and the use of AI for social
media analysis and propaganda. The report also lays out basic and applied research
priorities for China in the military AI space moving forward, such as “brain-inspired software
and hardware, human-machine teaming, swarming, and decision making” (p. 146).

More broadly, the above technologies demonstrate the military and economic areas that
China is prioritizing. China’s heavy research expenditures and its “focus on technological
independence and indigenous innovation” through policies such as Made in China 2025 and
China Standards 2035, has “positioned the PRC at, or near, the lead of numerous scientific
fields”—worrying many in the United States (p.146).
The report emphasizes particular advancements China made in these domains in 2020, such
as its allocation of around $85 million to AI research; its plans to expand its “2,000 km
quantum-secure communication ground line” connecting Beijing and Shanghai to other cities,
and to create a global, satellite-enabled version by 2030; and the People’s Liberation Army
Air Force’s initial fielding of the DF-17, a hypersonic glide vehicle (pp. 60,146). The report
refers to cyber elsewhere—as a more mature capability already better integrated into the
PLA.
Potential Pitfalls in China’s Military Development
The report underscores how China is modernizing and advancing its military, and how the
current Chinese regime views defense technology and innovation leadership as a critical
pillar supporting their effort to create world-class warfighting capabilities. Specifically, China
directly views its ability to harness and leverage emerging and disruptive technologies like AI
as decisive for its ability to achieve strategic goals such as taking Taiwan. This report
highlights that the DoD is aware of and concerned by these initiatives, which appear to be
systematic, well-resourced, and clearly delineated. However, while the report references
these technologies, and how China plans to develop them, it lacks specific detail on how the
People’s Liberation Army will use technological breakthroughs. Questions also remain about
China’s ability to operate these capabilities in combination, as the simultaneous integration of
emerging technologies and traditional operations will be organizationally challenging. So
while Chinese military power continues to grow, there is uncertainty about what role
emerging technologies will play in future conflicts, and when.
