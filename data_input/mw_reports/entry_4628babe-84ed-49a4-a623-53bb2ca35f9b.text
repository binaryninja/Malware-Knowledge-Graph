The master decryption keys for the Maze, Egregor, and Sekhmet
ransomware operations were released last night on the
BleepingComputer forums.
The master decryption keys for the Maze, Egregor, and Sekhmet ransomware families were
released on the BleepingComputer forums by the alleged malware developer.
The Maze group was considered one of the most prominent ransomware operations since it
began operating in May 2019. The gang was the first to introduce a double-extortion
model in the cybercrime landscape at the end of 2019. At the end of 2019, the Maze
ransomware implemented data harvesting capabilities and started threatening the victims to
release the stolen data for all those victims who refuse to pay the ransom.
In November 2020, the Maze ransomware operators announced that they have officially shut
down their operations and denied the creation of a cartel.
Maze operation then rebranded in September as Egregor, but on February 2021 several
members of the Egregor group were arrested in Ukraine.
The Sekhmet operation was launched in March 2020 and it has some similarities with the
above ransomware operations.
While TTP’s of Egregor operators are almost identical to that of ProLock, the analysis of
Egregor ransomware sample obtained during an incident response conducted by Group-IB
revealed that the executable code of Egregor is very similar to Sekhmet. The two strains
share some core features, use similar obfuscation technique. Egregor source code bears
similarities with Maze ransomware as well.
Now the decryption keys for these operations have now been leaked in the
BleepingComputer forums. The keys were shared by a user named ‘Topleak’ who claims to
be the developer for all three operations.
“Hello, It’s developer. It was decided to release keys to the public for Egregor, Maze,
Sekhmet ransomware families. also there is a little bit harmless source code of polymorphic
x86/x64 modular EPO file infector m0yv detected in the wild as Win64/Expiro virus, but it is

not expiro actually, but AV engines detect it like this, so no single thing in common with
gazavat.” the user wrote on the forum.
“Each archive with keys have corresponding keys inside the numeric folders which equal to
advert id in the config. In the “OLD” folder of maze leak is keys for it’s old version with e-mail
based. Consider to make decryptor first for this one, because there were too many regular
PC users for this version. Enjoy!”
TopLeak user pointed out that it is a planned leak, and is not linked to recent arrests and
takedowns conducted by law enforcement. The alleged ransomware developer added that
none of the ransomware gang will ever return in ransomware operation and that the source
code of tools ever made is wiped out.
In one of the archives leaked by the user there is the source code for a malware dubbed
‘M0yv’ that was part of the gang’s arsenal.

Source Bleeping Computer
The popular malware researchers Michael Gillespie and Fabian Wosar confirmed to
BleepingComputer that they are decryption keys are legitimate and allow to decrypt files
encrypted by the three ransomware families for free.
Emsisoft has released a decryptor a free decryption tool for the Maze, Egregor, and Sekhmet
ransomware.
