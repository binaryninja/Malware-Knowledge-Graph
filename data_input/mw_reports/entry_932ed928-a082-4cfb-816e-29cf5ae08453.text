From April 21, 2020, 360Netlab Anglerfish honeypot started to see a new QNAP NAS
vulnerability being used to launch attack against QNAP NAS equipment. We noticed that this
vulnerability has not been announced on the Internet, and the attacker is cautious in the
process of exploiting it.

Vulnerability analysis
Vulnerability type: Unauthorized remote command execution vulnerability
When we enter the sample into the 360 FirmwareTotal system, we found that this
vulnerability appeared in the CGI program /httpd/cgi-bin/authLogout.cgi . This CGI is
used when user logout, and it select the corresponding logout function based on the field
name in the Cookie. The problem is QPS_SID , QMS_SID and QMMS_SID does not filter
special characters and directly calls the snprintf function to splice curl command string
and calls the system function to run the string, thus making command injection possible.
Vulnerability fix: We contacted the vendor and shared the PoC on May/13, and on Aug 12,
QNAP PSIRT replied and indicated the vulnerability had been fixed in previous update but
there still are devices on the network that have not been patched. We looked into the
vendorsâ€™ firmwares and discovered that on July 21, 2017, QNAP released firmware version
4.3.3 and this version included the fix for this vulnerability. This release replaced the
system function with qnap_exec , and the qnap_exec function is defined in the
/usr/lib/libuLinux_Util.so.0 . By using the execv to execute custom command,
command injection has been avoided.

Attacker behavior analysis
We captured two attackers IP 219.85.109.140 and 103.209.253.252 , both use the
same Payload, after successful exploits, the device will wget
http://165.227.39.105:8096/aaa file.

1/4

So far the attacker has not implanted bot programs like regular Botnets, and the entire attack
process does not seem to be fully automated. we still do not know the true purpose of the
attacker yet.
On 165.227.39.105:8096 , we found two other text .sl and rv . The .sl file contains
2 lines.
IvHVFqkpELqvuN@WK
IvHVFqkpJEqr|DNWLr

rv , this file is a bash reverse shell script, the control address is 165.227.39.105 , and the

port is TCP/1234 .
When we fingerprint this host, we see that 165.227.39.105 has SSH, Metasploit, Apache
httpd and other services running.
Discovered open port 9393/tcp on 165.227.39.105 //SSH
Discovered open port 5678/tcp on 165.227.39.105 //Unknown
Discovered open port 3790/tcp on 165.227.39.105 //Metasploit
Discovered open port 80/tcp on 165.227.39.105
//Apache httpd

Timeline
On May 13, 2020, we emailed the QNAP vendor and reported the details of the
vulnerability and shared the PoC.
On August 12, 2020, QNAP PSIRT replied that the vulnerability had been fixed in early
updates, but such attacks still exist in the network.
