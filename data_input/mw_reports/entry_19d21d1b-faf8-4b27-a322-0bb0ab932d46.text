Welcome to the Connected World
Imagine the 1960s office of the fictional advertising
agency portrayed on the American television show
“Mad Men”: When it came to technology, workers
could avail themselves of typewriters and telephones
(both operated largely by the secretarial pool)—which
were basically all they had in the way of productivityenhancing equipment. Employees attended perhaps
one or two meetings a day; work began when people
arrived at the office, and stopped when they went home.
Today’s workers get more done over breakfast or during
the morning commute than their 1960s predecessors
accomplished in an entire day. Thanks to the array of
technology innovations flooding into the workplace—
everything from tablets to social networking to videoconferencing systems such as telepresence—employees
can work almost anywhere and anytime they need
to, provided the right technology is there to support
connectivity and, even more importantly, provide security.
In fact, the modern workplace may differ from its 1960s
counterpart most dramatically in terms of the lack of
actual people: Showing up at the office is less and
less necessary.
Along with the onslaught of technology innovations,
there’s also been a shift in attitude. Today’s workers
have become so accustomed to the productivity benefits
and ease of use of their devices, social networks, and
web applications that they see no reason why they

can’t use all these tools for work as well as for play.
The boundaries between work and home are nearly
nonexistent: These workers chat with their supervisors
on Facebook, check work email on Apple iPads after
watching a movie with the kids, and turn their own
smartphones into mini-workstations.
Unsurprisingly, many enterprises are questioning the
impact of technology innovation and flexible work habits
on corporate information security—and sometimes, take
the drastic step of banning devices or restricting access
to web services that workers say they need (and do
need, in most cases). But organizations that don’t allow
workers this flexibility—for instance, allowing them to use
only a given company-owned smartphone—will soon find
they can’t attract talent or remain innovative.
Research conducted for the Cisco Connected World
Technology Report study (www.cisco.com/en/US/netsol/
ns1120/index.html) documents changing attitudes toward
work, technology, and security among college students
and young professionals around the globe, who are
driving the next waves of change in the enterprise.
(Workers of all ages have been responsible for increasing
adoption of consumer devices in the workplace and
anytime/anywhere information access, but younger
workers and new graduates are drastically speeding up
the pace of change.) This year’s edition of the Cisco
Annual Security Report highlights many key findings from
this research, exploring the impact on enterprises and
suggesting strategies for enabling innovation.

For instance, most college students (81 percent)
surveyed globally believe they should be able to choose
the devices they need to do their jobs—either by having
their employers pay for them or bringing their own
personal devices to work. In addition, almost threequarters of students surveyed believe they should be
able to use such devices for both business and personal
use. Multiple devices are becoming commonplace:
77 percent of surveyed employees worldwide have
multiple devices in use, such as a laptop and a
smartphone or multiple phones and computers. (See
“Your Future Workers: Loaded with Devices, and Not
Overly Concerned About Security,” page 5.)

A Balanced, Flexible Approach to Security
Trends such as the influx of consumer devices in the
workplace will require more flexible and creative solutions
from IT staff for maintaining security while enabling
access to collaborative technologies. Given the desire
of workers to bring the devices they use at home into
the workplace, enterprises need to adopt a “bring your
own device” (BYOD) vision—that is, securing the network
and data regardless of how workers access information.
(See “Remote Access and BYOD: Enterprises Working
to Find Common Ground with Employees,” page 10.)

“Today’s IT departments need to enable the chaos that
comes from a BYOD environment,” says Nasrin Rezai,
Cisco’s senior director of security architecture and chief
security officer for the Collaboration Business Group.
“This doesn’t mean accepting high levels of risk, but
being willing to manage some risks in exchange for
attracting talent and delivering innovation. It’s about
moving to a world in which not every technology asset
can be managed by IT.”

A willingness to balance risks and benefits is a hallmark
of IT’s new posture toward security. Instead of outright
bans on devices or access to social media, enterprises
must exchange flexibility for controls that workers agree
to. For instance, IT staff may say, “You can use your
personal smartphone to read and respond to company
email, but we need to manage that asset. And if you lose
that phone, we’ll need to erase data remotely, including
your personal apps and pictures of your family.”

Workers must be part of this compromise: They need
to see the value of cooperating with IT so they can use
the tools they have come to rely on—and help lay the
groundwork for a process that will enable faster adoption
of new technologies in the workplace as they emerge.
Another fundamental adjustment by enterprises and their
security teams is the acceptance of the public nature of
business. According to the Connected World study, young
professionals and students see far fewer boundaries
between work life and personal life: 33 percent of
college students say they don’t mind sharing personal
information online.
“The older generation assumes everything is private,
except what they choose to make public,” explains
David Evans, chief futurist for Cisco. “To the younger
generation, everything is public, except what they
choose to make private. This default position—that
everything is public—goes against how enterprises have
worked in the past. They’ve competed and innovated
based on protecting their information from being exposed.
However, they need to realize that the benefits they
receive from sharing information are greater than the
risks of keeping information within their walls.”
The good news for IT is that their role as enablers
of collaboration and sharing should lead to greater
responsibility—and hopefully, more budget—for the
enterprise’s growth and development. “Success is
when IT can enable these dramatic changes in the
workplace, not inhibit them,” says John N. Stewart,
vice president and chief security officer for Cisco.
“We should not focus on specific issues, like whether
to allow people to use their iPads at work, because it’s
a foregone conclusion. Rather, focus on solutions to
the bigger business challenge: enabling technology
for competitive advantage.”

Ten years ago, employees were assigned laptops
and told not to lose them. They were given logins
to the company network, and told not to tell
anyone their password. End of security training.
Today, your “millennial” employees—the people you
want to hire because of the fresh ideas and energy
they can bring to your business—show up to their first
day on the job toting their own phones, tablets, and
laptops, and expect to integrate them into their work
life. They also expect others—namely, IT staff and
chief information officers—to figure out how they can
use their treasured devices, anywhere and anytime
they want to, without putting the enterprise at risk.
Security, they believe, is not really their responsibility:
They want to work hard, from home or the office,
using social networks and cloud applications to get
the job done, while someone else builds seamless
security into their interactions.
Research from the Connected World study offers
a snapshot of how younger workers and college
students about to enter the workforce view security,
access to information, and mobile devices. Here’s a
snapshot of who you’ll be hiring, based on findings
from the study:

Prefers an unconventional work schedule,
working anytime and anywhere

Believes he should be allowed to access social media
and personal websites from company-issued devices

Checks Facebook page
at least once a day

THE ANYTIME, ANYWHERE YOUNG WORKER
Doesn’t believe he needs to be in the office
on a regular basis

Believes that IT is ultimately responsible
for security, not him

Will violate IT policies if it’s
necessary to get the job done

Owns multiple devices, such as laptops, tablets,
and mobile phones (often more than one)

Social Media:
Now, It’s a Productivity Tool
Facebook and Twitter long ago moved beyond mere
novelty sites for teens and geeks, and became vital
channels for communicating with groups and promoting
brands. Young professionals and college students know
this, and weave social media into every aspect of their
lives. (And while Facebook and Twitter are the dominant
players in much of the world, many other regional
social networks are becoming just as essential to online
interaction—for instance, Qzone in China, VKontakte in
Russia and former Soviet-bloc countries, Orkut in Brazil,
and Mixi in Japan.)
However, enterprises may not understand the extent
to which social media has made inroads into the public
and private lives of their employees, especially younger
workers—and therefore, do not feel the need to yield to
growing demand in their workforce for unfettered access
to social networks like Facebook or content-sharing sites
such as YouTube. Unfortunately, this inertia may cost
them the talent they need to grow and succeed. If access
to social networks isn’t granted, young professionals
who expect to have it are likely to seek work at companies
that do provide such access. These attitudes are even
more prevalent among college students, who have been
using social media from a young age.
According to research for the Connected World study,
college students and young workers center their social
and business interactions around Facebook. Eightynine percent of college students surveyed check their
Facebook page at least once a day; seventy-three percent
of young professionals do so as well. For young workers,

their social media connections often extend into the
workplace: Seven out of 10 employees said they have
friended managers or co-workers on the social media site.
Given their level of activity on Facebook—and the lack of
distinction between personal and business use of the
social media site—it stands to reason that young workers
want to carry their Facebook use into the office. Among
college students surveyed, almost half (47 percent)
said they believe companies should maintain flexible
social media policies, presumably to allow them to stay
connected in their work and personal lives at any time.
If students encounter a workplace that discourages
social media usage, they may avoid these companies
altogether—or if they’re stuck working in these environ–
ments, they may try to subvert the rules blocking access
to their favorite sites. More than half of college students
surveyed globally (56 percent) said if they encountered
a company that banned access to social media, they
would either not accept a job there, or would join and
then find a way to access social media despite corporate
policies. Two out of three college students (64 percent)
said they plan to ask about social media usage policies
during job interviews, and one in four (24 percent) said
such policies would be a key factor in their decision to
accept a position.

When enterprises accept social media use by the
workforce, they are providing their employees with the
tools—and the culture—they need to be more productive,
innovative, and competitive. For example, hiring managers
can use social networks to recruit new talent. Marketing
teams can monitor social media channels to track the
success of advertising campaigns or consumer sentiment
about brands. And customer service teams can respond
to consumers who use social media to ask questions
and provide feedback to companies.
Fears around security and data loss are a leading reason
why many businesses don’t embrace social media,
but these concerns are likely out of proportion with the
true level of risk (see “Myth vs. Reality: Social Media Is
Dangerous to the Enterprise” on facing page); in any
case, risks can be mitigated through the application of
technology and user controls. For instance, web traffic
controls can halt malware such as Koobface1 that finds

The Upside of Social Media Access
Since social media is already so entrenched in the
daily lives of young professionals and future workers,
enterprises can no longer view it as a passing nuisance
or a negative, disruptive force. In fact, companies that
block or narrow access to social media likely will find
themselves at a competitive disadvantage.

its way through Facebook and Twitter. These controls
don’t inhibit workers from browsing social media and
using it to connect with colleagues, customers, and
business partners. They are stopped from social media
activity only when they are in danger of downloading
an infected file or clicking on a suspicious link. The
protection is invisible to users, and is built into the
network, not computers or devices. Workers get the
social media access they demand, and businesses get
the information safety they require. (See more on social
media protections in “The Future for Acceptable Use
Policies,” page 19.)
Social media sites themselves have responded to
requests to offer greater levels of control over what
users can see within a network. For example, a business
can allow workers to access YouTube to view videos
related to its industry or product, but block access
to adult content or gambling sites. And technology
solutions can filter social media traffic for incoming
malware or outgoing data (for instance, company files
that should not be emailed via social media or other
web-based services).
To protect a business’s users against unauthorized
access to their accounts, Facebook has steadily
introduced privacy features. While these are individual
user controls as opposed to network controls, businesses
can engage in discussion with workers and offer training
about the most useful privacy features for maintaining
information security.

Myth vs. Reality:
Social Media Is Dangerous to the Enterprise
Myth:
Allowing employees to use social media opens the door wide to malware in the company network, and
will cause productivity to plummet. In addition, employees will divulge company secrets and inside gossip
on Facebook and Twitter, damaging the enterprise’s competitive position.
Reality:
There’s no doubt that criminals have used social media networks to lure victims into downloading malware
and handing over login passwords. But the fear of threats delivered via social media may be overblown.
Email messages remain the most popular way to get malware into networks.
Certainly, enterprises should be concerned about loss of intellectual property, but social media doesn’t
deserve full blame for such losses. Employees who haven’t been trained to protect their employer’s
information can unleash secrets by indiscreet chats in public places or via email as fast as they can tweet,
and they can download company documents onto thumb drives as easily as trading information over
Facebook email. The answer to IP leakage is not an outright ban on social media. It’s imbuing trust in the
workforce so workers don’t feel compelled to disclose sensitive information.
“The loss of productivity due to social networking has been the subject of many media scare stories,” says
Jeff Shipley, manager of Cisco Security Research and Operations. “However, the truth is that employees
can do more work, and do so better and faster, when they use tools that let them rapidly collaborate on
projects and talk to customers. Today, social media networks are those tools. The productivity gains make
up for the occasional downtime inherent in social networking.”

Before limiting access to social media, enterprises
should consider the business value of social media
versus the risk of allowing it. Considering the findings
of the Connected World study and the passion young
workers have for social media and its collaborative
powers, businesses are likely to discover the benefits
outweigh the risks—provided they find the right balance
between acceptance and security.

Remote Access and BYOD:

Enterprises Working to Find Common Ground with Employees
While the question of whether to allow employees
to access social media during work hours and with
company assets is top of mind for many organizations,
a more pressing concern is finding the right balance
between allowing their employees to have access to
the tools and information they need to do their jobs
well—anytime, anywhere—while also keeping sensitive
corporate data, such as intellectual property and
employees’ personal information, secure.

Workforce Access Along

Cisco 2011 Annual Security Report

Device Independence

Enterprises across industries are starting to understand
they must adapt soon to “consumerization of IT”
(employees’ introduction and adoption of consumer
devices in the enterprise) and the remote working
trends already under way in their organizations. It is
becoming increasingly clear that if they don’t change,
they cannot stay competitive, innovate, maintain a
productive workforce, and attract and keep top talent.
At the same time, they are realizing that maintaining

previously defined security borders is no longer possible.
“IT organizations, particularly those in large companies,
have not been able to keep pace with the Internet-speed
growth of new devices and the immediate adoption of
those devices by employees—especially younger workers,”
says Gavin Reid, Computer Security Incident Response
Team (CSIRT) manager for Cisco.
There clearly is an expectation among tomorrow’s young
professionals—as well as many of today’s—that they will
be able to access whatever they need from wherever
they are in order to do their jobs. And if they aren’t
provided with that access, the consequences for the
enterprise are potentially significant. As an example, the
Connected World study revealed that three in 10 young
professionals globally admit that the absence of remote
access would influence their job decisions, such as leaving
an existing job sooner than later or declining job offers
outright. They also indicate they would be more likely to
slack off while on the job and experience lower morale.

As for today’s college students, most can’t even imagine
a future work experience that did not include the ability to
access work remotely. According to the Cisco Connected
World Technology survey, nearly two in three college
students expect that, when they are in the workforce, they
will be able to access their corporate network using
their home computer. Meanwhile, about half of college
students expect to do the same using their personal
mobile devices. And more than likely, if the enterprise
does not allow them to do these things, these future
workers will find a way to overcome obstacles to access.
The report also reveals that most college students
(71 percent) share the view that company-issued devices
should be available for both work and play because
“work time often blends with personal time … It’s the way
it is today and the way it will be in the future.” That latter
statement is very true, which is why more enterprises
are moving to implement a BYOD practice. Other factors,
including workforce mobility, the proliferation of new

Technology Making a Safer Journey to BYOD for Cisco

devices, and acquisition integration and management
of offshore and offsite outsource relationships, are also
key drivers.
Cisco is one organization already making the transition
to BYOD—and is learning quickly that this transformation
requires both long-term commitment and crossfunctional engagement in the organization. Depicted
in Figure 1 on the previous page are the five stages
of workforce access along what Cisco calls its “Any
Device” journey toward becoming a “virtual enterprise.”
By the time Cisco reaches the last stage of its planned
journey, which will take several years, the organization
will be increasingly location- and service-independent—
and enterprise data still will be secure.2
The specific demands of an organization’s industry
segment (regulatory demands) and corporate culture
(risk tolerance versus innovation) drive BYOD decisions.
“I think for many organizations today, the BYOD issue is
less a matter of ‘No, we can’t do it’ and more a question
of ‘How do we do it? What positive, responsive actions
should we take to manage the mobile device situation
in our organization?’” says Nasrin Rezai, Cisco’s senior
director of security architecture and chief security officer
for the Collaboration Business Group.

As part of the decision to allow employees to use
any device for work, including unmanaged personal
devices, Cisco IT, along with CSIRT, sought a tool
that would block malicious websites before they
loaded onto browsers. In short, they wanted protection
against zero-day threats—specifically those without a
known signature. However, the solution also needed
to preserve the user experience—not only to ensure
productivity, but also to prevent employees from
changing their browser settings.

determines whether to allow or reject the entire
website, or individual objects on the website, based
on a reputation score from the Cisco IronPort
SenderBase® Security Network (www.senderbase.
org) cloud-based email and web traffic monitoring
service. SenderBase assigns each website a
reputation score ranging from –10 to 10. Websites
with scores from –6 to –10 are blocked automatically,
without scanning. Websites with scores from 6 to
10 are allowed, also without scanning.

Cisco IT and CSIRT achieved their goal by deploying
the Cisco IronPort® S670 Web Security Appliance
(WSA), a web proxy that inspects and then either
forwards or drops web traffic based on reputation
filters or the outcome of inline file scanning. (Cisco
does not use the WSA’s web-filtering capabilities to
block entire website categories because its policy is
to trust employees to use their time productively.)

Cisco deployed the Cisco IronPort S670 WSA
throughout its organization in three phases, which
began with a six-month proof-of-concept program in
one building of the Cisco campus in Research Triangle
Park (RTP), North Carolina, followed by a two-year
pilot program (2009–2011) in which the solution was
extended to all 3000 employees at the RTP campus.
In 2011, the WSA was rolled out to other large
campus sites worldwide and tens of thousands of
employees. As of November 2011, Cisco’s global
WSA deployment is 100 percent complete.

When a Cisco employee clicks a link or enters a
URL, the request is sent by way of Web Cache
Communication Protocol (WCCP) to a load-balanced
pool of Cisco IronPort S670 WSAs. The WSA

One common theme among organizations moving
toward the practice of BYOD is that there is buy-in
from top executives who are helping not only to bring
the matter to the forefront in the company, but also

“Cisco is now experiencing its highest-ever level
of protection from web-based threats,” says Jeff
Bollinger, senior information security investigator for
Cisco. “We average 40,000 blocked transactions
per hour. And in just one day, the WSAs blocked
7.3 million transactions, including 23,200 Trojan
downloader attempts, over 6800 Trojan horses,
700 worms, and nearly 100 phishing URLs.”

Myth vs. Reality:
Workers Won’t Accept Enterprise Control
of Their Mobile Devices
drive it further. Rezai explains, “Executives are playing a
lead role in driving adoption of BYOD in the enterprise.
They’re taking the risk of embracing the chaos, but also
saying, ‘We will do this systemically and architecturally,
and evaluate our progress every step of the way.’” (See
sidebar, “Questions to Ask Along Your Own ‘Any Device’
Journey,” on facing page.)
Governance also is critical to the success of a BYOD
practice. Cisco, as an example, maintains a BYOD steering
committee, which is led by IT but includes key stakeholders
from other business units, such as human resources
and legal. Without formal governance, companies cannot
define a clear path for how to move the organization
successfully and strategically from a managed world to
an unmanaged or “borderless” world, where the security
perimeter is no longer defined and IT does not manage
every technology asset in use in the organization.
“Many people think BYOD is about the endpoint, but
it’s much broader than that,” says Russell Rice, director
of product management for Cisco. “It’s about ensuring
consistency of the user experience working from any
device, whether it’s in a wired or wireless environment
or in the cloud. It’s about the policy elements of interaction.
And it’s about your data, how it’s secured, and how it
traverses inside all of those different environments.
All of these things must be taken into account when
moving to BYOD—it really is a change in mindset.”

Cisco 2011 Annual Security Report

Myth:
Employees will not accept an employer’s requirement to have some remote control over
the personal mobile device that they want to use for both work and play.
Reality:
Enterprises and employees must find common ground, with the company recognizing the
individual’s need to use the device of his or her choice and the worker understanding that the
company must do whatever is necessary to enforce its security policy and stay in compliance
with regulatory requirements related to data security.
Organizations must be able to identify unique devices when they enter the corporate network, link
devices to specific users, and control the security posture of devices used to connect to corporate
services. Technology is evolving that would allow the “containerization” of a device—that is, a virtual phone
within a phone that could be shut off by an employer in the event the device is lost or stolen, without
compromising a user’s personal data, which is kept separate. Within the next few years, viable security
solutions based on this technology should be available for widespread enterprise use.
Until then, employees who want to use their personal device
of choice for work must accept that the enterprise, for security
reasons, retains certain rights in order to protect the device.
This includes requiring, among other things:
• Passwords
• Data encryption (including device and removable
media encryption)
• Remote management options that allow IT to remotely
lock or wipe a device if it is lost, stolen, or otherwise
compromised, or if the employee is terminated
If a worker does not accept policy enforcement and asset
management requirements that are designed to elevate a mobile
device’s status to “trusted” according to the enterprise’s security
standards, then IT will not permit the employee to access
safeguarded company assets with his or her device of choice.

Questions to Ask Along Your Own “Any Device” Journey
When Cisco first embarked on its “Any Device” journey, the company identified 13 critical business areas affected by this new paradigm. The table below highlights
these focus areas and provides a list of questions that have helped Cisco identify—and avoid—potential pitfalls and determine how best to approach these
considerations. Enterprises that want to adopt a BYOD practice should consider these questions as well.3

Business Area

Business Questions to Answer

Business continuity planning
and disaster recovery

Should noncorporate devices be granted access or restricted from business continuity planning?

Host management (patching)

Will noncorporate devices be permitted to join existing corporate host-management streams?

Client configuration management and
device security validation

How will device compliance to security protocols be validated and kept up to date?

Remote-access strategies
Software licensing

3

Should there be an ability to remotely wipe any end device accessing the network if it is lost or stolen?

Who should be entitled to what services and platforms on which devices?
Should a contingent worker be given the same entitlement to end devices, applications, and data?
Should policy change to permit installation of corporate-licensed software on noncorporate devices?
Do existing software agreements account for users accessing the same software application through multiple devices?

Encryption requirements

Should noncorporate devices comply with existing disk-encryption requirements?

Authentication and authorization

Will noncorporate devices be expected or permitted to join existing Microsoft Active Directory models?

Regulatory compliance management

What will organizational policy be on the use of noncorporate devices in high-compliance or high-risk scenarios?

Mobile Device Distribution in the Enterprise and Malware Encounters
The Connected World survey revealed that three
out of four employees worldwide (77 percent) have
multiple devices, such as a laptop and a smartphone
or multiple phones and computers. Thirty-three
percent of young professionals (one in three) say
they use at least three devices for work. But which
mobile device platforms are favored by most
workers today, in general?
In conducting research for the latest Cisco Global
Threat Report, Cisco ScanSafe took a close look at
the types of mobile device platforms that workers
around the world are using in the enterprise.*
Surprisingly, RIM BlackBerry devices—which
have long been accepted in most enterprise
environments—are now the fourth most popular
platform among workers.

Even more startling, perhaps, is that Apple Inc.’s
iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch devices are currently
the most dominant platform—significantly so. Google
Android holds the second spot, with Nokia/Symbian
devices ranking third.** These results underscore the
powerful impact that consumerization of IT has had
on enterprises in just a short period: The first iPhone
was released in 2007; the first commercially available
Android phone was launched in 2008.
Cisco ScanSafe’s research also provides insight into
which mobile device platforms are encountering
malware. The answer: all of them. (See chart below.)
While BlackBerry devices are currently experiencing

Mobile Device Use by Enterprise

the majority of encounters (over 80 percent), Cisco’s
senior security threat researcher Mary Landesman
says the malware is not targeted specifically at
BlackBerry devices or users, and it’s doubtful the
malware encountered has infected or had any other
impact on those devices.
Landesman adds, “Wherever users go, cybercriminals
will follow. As mobile device use continues to grow
among enterprise users, malware targeting those
devices—and thus, users—also will grow. (For more
on cybercriminals’ increasing investment in exploits
that target mobile device users, see the “Cisco
Cybercrime Return on Investment Matrix,” page 26.)

The iPad Revolution: Tablets and Security
When the Apple iPad tablet computer launched
in 2010, it was positioned (and embraced by the
public) as a consumer device: Watching movies
with the kids, browsing the web while sitting on
the couch, and reading books were among the
favorite use cases.
However, many industry sectors, like healthcare and
manufacturing, quickly saw the appeal of a powerful,
easy-to-use mobile device for business use that
would bridge the gap between smartphones (too
small) and laptops (too bulky). In a recent earnings
call, Apple’s chief financial officer said that 86
percent of Fortune 500 businesses and 47 percent
of Global 500 companies are deploying or testing
the iPad; companies such as General Electric Co.
and SAP are creating custom iPad apps for internal
processes; and Alaska Airlines and American Airlines
pilots are using the iPad in cockpits to replace
paper-based navigational information.4

Regardless of whether enterprises or workers
are driving adoption of iPads and other tablets, the
devices are generating questions and concerns about
securing company information accessed via tablets.
Unlike smartphones, iPads and tablets offer more
robust compute platforms, with which workers can
accomplish more than they can with smartphones.
Forward-thinking enterprises want to enable the
inclusion of tablets, without compromising security.
Innovation has caused constant change in IT—and the
rate of change is increasing. Companies that design
their device strategy around 2011’s popular choice
(in this case, the iPad) will have to start the clock on
re-engineering their systems in a few years’ time,
when new vendors, products, and features emerge.

At the same time, workers who use iPads and other
tablets at home are asking their employers to let
them use the devices at the office—yet another
consumerization of IT milestone. This is reflected
in the Cisco Connected World study, in which 81
percent of college students said they expect to
be able to choose the device for their jobs, either
receiving budget to buy devices of their choice, or
bringing in their own personal devices.

4

A more strategic decision is to shift the security
conversation away from specific devices, and toward
a BYOD enablement strategy with access based
on user, role, and device type (for more on BYOD
practice, see page 10). The key to enabling any device
in the enterprise, whether it’s company-owned or
brought from home, is identity management—that is,
understanding who’s using the device, where they’re
using it, and what information they’re accessing.
In addition, enterprises welcoming tablet use in the
workplace will need methods for device management
(e.g., wiping data from lost devices), just as they
have for smartphones and laptops.
For tablets—and indeed, whatever new-and-cool
devices come into the enterprise next—security
professionals need to preserve the user experience
even as they add security features. For instance,
iPad users love the device’s touchscreen controls,
such as moving fingers across the screen to view
or zoom in on images. If IT departments build in
security that restricts these much-loved features,
users will balk at the changes.
“The best approach to tablet security is one that
allows the ability to isolate business and personal
apps and data reliably, applying appropriate security
policy to each,” says Horacio Zambrano, product
manager for Cisco. “Policy happens in the cloud or
with an intelligent network, while for the employee,
their user experience is preserved and they can
leverage the native app capabilities of the device.”

The Influence of Mobile Devices,
Cloud Services, and Social Media on
Security Policy in the Enterprise
The cost of just one data breach can be staggering
for an enterprise. Ponemon Institute estimates range
anywhere from US$1 million to US$58 million.5 The
cost is not just financial, either: Damage to corporate
reputation and loss of customers and market share are
potential side effects of a high-profile data loss incident.
As more employees become mobile workers and use
multiple devices to access company assets and rely
on collaborative applications to work with others while
outside the traditional “four walls” of the enterprise,
the potential for data loss grows. As an example, the
Cisco Connected World survey (www.cisco.com/en/US/
netsol/ns1120/index.html) found that almost half (46
percent) of young professionals send work emails via
personal accounts.
“The potential for data loss is high,” says David
Paschich, web security product manager for Cisco.
“Enterprises are steadily losing control over who has
access to their corporate network. And the simple fact
that more employees are using mobile devices for
work—and sometimes, multiple devices—means that
the potential for data loss due to theft or loss of a
device is greater.”
Cybercriminals’ growing preference toward the use of
low-volume, targeted attacks, such as spearphishing
campaigns (see “Global Spam Update: Dramatic Decline
in Spam Volume”, page 29), to steal information from
high-value targets, and the increasing use of cloudbased file sharing services by enterprises to increase

5

efficiency and reduce costs (see next section, “Securing
Enterprise Data in the Cloud”) are also heightening the
potential for data to be stolen or compromised.
In this landscape, it’s not surprising that more enterprises
are renewing their focus on data loss prevention (DLP)
efforts. “Today, businesses are evaluating their DLP
programs to determine two things: if they are protecting
the right data and if they are doing the right things to keep
that data safe,” says John N. Stewart, vice president and
chief security officer for Cisco.
When categorizing data that must be kept safe, a good
starting place for many organizations is to determine
what data types require protection and security, based
on applicable laws and regulations, which can vary by
industry and geographic location (e.g., state, country).
“You can’t build rings of security around what you need
to protect if you don’t know what those things are,” says
Jeff Shipley, manager for Cisco Security Research and
Operations. “This is a major shift in thinking for many
organizations that focus their security controls on the
systems and network, not the granularity of the actual
data on the various systems, across multiple systems,
or the network.” He adds that enterprises should not
overlook intellectual property when categorizing data to
be secured.
Shipley also cautions enterprise IT departments not to
miss obvious opportunities to prevent data from “walking
out the front door.” He says, “Here’s an example: If an
enterprise would protect its sensitive files, such as Excel

sheets containing customer data, with controls to prevent
downloading or moving the data from centralized
applications or databases, the chance of an employee
downloading that data to a personal or mobile device
before leaving the company is greatly reduced.”
Paschich also warns enterprises not to overlook a lower
profile but very potent threat to data security—USB devices.
“While companies are worrying about whether or not
to let an employee connect to the network with an
iPhone because they are concerned about undermining
enterprise security, they are allowing their workers to
plug USB devices into their laptops and copy whatever
data they want.”
He offers an additional tip for shoring up data protection
in the enterprise: laying out DLP measures and acceptable
use policies (AUPs) in separate documents. “These
efforts are interlocking, certainly, but they are different,”
says Paschich. (See “The Future for Acceptable Use
Policies,” page19.)

Securing Enterprise Data in the Cloud
Cloud-based file sharing has become a popular and
convenient method for sharing large files across the
Internet, and it represents another potential risk area for
enterprise data security. The idea of sensitive corporate
information being passed back and forth among webbased cloud services—which are not managed by the
enterprise—can cause sleepless nights for security
professionals.

In tandem with assessing vendors, enterprises planning
to establish corporate policy on file sharing in the cloud
should take the following steps:
Establish a system for classifying data. Documents
can be classified by their sensitivity level—for instance,
“public,” “confidential,” “highly confidential,” and so
on, depending on business needs. Workers should
be trained in how to apply these designations, and
understand how they may affect the ability to share
files in the cloud.
Establish a system for handling specialized data.
Data that has legal or compliance implications needs
special handling in terms of retention policies, physical
location, and backup media requirements. Enterprises
need to define policies around sending such data to
external audiences, in addition to its classification per
sensitivity levels.

Cloud-based file sharing is gaining ground because
it’s easy to use: The signup process for services like
Box.net or Dropbox is fast and simple, the services don’t
require hardware or advanced software, and they are
free or low cost.
They also streamline collaboration between workers
and external consultants and partners, since files can be
shared without generating time-consuming and complex
methods for accessing corporate networks. Younger
workers, who are conditioned to rely on cloud services
such as webmail and social networks, will no doubt
embrace cloud file sharing and drive its greater adoption
in the enterprise.
Ceding control of corporate data to the cloud, especially
a piece of the cloud that an enterprise doesn’t control,
raises legitimate questions about information security.
“Many new vendors in this market are startups with
limited experience in providing enterprise-wide services,
and with challenges it brings to the table,” says Amol
Godbole, information security lead for the Cisco Security

Programs Organization (CSPO). “In addition, security
and encryption standards can vary widely from provider
to provider. The benefits of file sharing in the cloud
are many, but enterprises should ask tough questions
of file sharing providers about their policies for
maintaining security.”
These questions include:
• What kind of encryption controls does
the vendor provide?
• Which personnel have access to customer data?
• Who manages incident response and
monitoring—the vendor or the customer?
• Does the vendor outsource some services to other
suppliers? Are these suppliers caching data?
• Are DLP policies in place?
• Does the vendor conduct periodic
security assessments?

Implement a DLP solution. File sharing vendors may not
offer the granular level of DLP control that enterprises
require. A DLP solution within the network can block data
from being uploaded to file sharing services based on
classifications—for instance, tax files or source code.
Provide identity management to control access. Users
should be authenticated by the network before they
are permitted to upload or download files. Leveraging
corporate identity and identity federation for internal
and external collaboration and managing the life cycle
of provisioned accounts are key.
Set expectations from the vendor. Clear and well-defined
policies and services should be part of the service level
agreement (SLA)—for instance, redundancy systems
and encryption controls, practices around access to
data by third parties (e.g., law enforcement), defining
shared responsibilities that might include incident response,
monitoring and administrative functions, and data transfer/
purging activities prior to termination of the contract.

• What redundancy measures are in place?
How and where are backup files stored?

U.S. Lawmakers Pursue Data Breach Disclosure Measures
Several high-profile data breaches in 2011, including
incidents involving Sony Corp.6 and Citigroup Inc.7, have
had U.S. lawmakers working to pass legislation that will
impact how businesses protect consumer information
and notify the public about cybersecurity incidents.
Three data breach and privacy bills were approved
and passed by the U.S. Senate’s Judiciary Committee
in September 2011; the Senate Commerce Committee
and the House Energy and Commerce Committee
are working on versions as well. In the Senate, any
version that passes likely will be a compromise of all
versions that pass Senate committees and, perhaps,
rolled into any larger comprehensive cyber bill that
moves through the Senate. The versions that passed
the Senate Judiciary Committee are:
The Data Breach Notification Act of 20118
This measure would require federal agencies and
businesses that “engage in interstate commerce”
and possess data containing sensitive personally
identifiable information to disclose any breaches.
The Personal Data Protection
and Breach Accountability Act9
The act would establish a process to help companies
create appropriate minimum security standards to
safeguard sensitive consumer information. It also
would require companies to issue prompt notification
to individuals following a data breach.

The Personal Data Privacy and Security Act of 201110
This measure would establish a national standard for
companies to follow when reporting data breaches.
Additionally, it would require businesses to implement
data privacy and security programs designed to
prevent data breaches from occurring. The bill also
includes criminal penalties.

At the time reporting for the Cisco 2011 Annual
Security Report was concluded, federal data breach
notification legislation was still pending in the U.S.
Congress, along with comprehensive cybersecurity
legislation designed to help protect financial networks,
transportation systems, and power grids. The Senate
has been working on comprehensive cybersecurity
legislation for over a year; in May 2011, the Obama
administration shared its view of what such legislation
should include.11

The Future for Acceptable Use Policies
Many acceptable use policies (AUPs) were born out of
a need for enterprises to set down rules for how workers
could access the Internet during work hours using
corporate assets. Over time, many policies have become
bloated catch-all documents designed to cover everything from Internet access to social media use to what
employees cannot say about their company while
engaging in online channels during off-hours. As a result,
these policies, well intentioned as they are, have been
difficult for employees to absorb and adhere to, and
almost impossible for enterprises to enforce.

Reid says a better approach is for enterprises to rethink
the AUP to make it relevant and enforceable, and adds
that many organizations are already doing that. The
new AUPs coming out of this process are leaner and
stronger. They are generally much shorter lists—some
include only a handful of items, such as making it
clear that employees cannot use peer-to-peer (P2P)
applications or send spam from their desktop. And
every item on these lists is “technically enforceable,”
according to Reid, meaning that the organization has
the technology in place to identify AUP violations.

Given the results of the Cisco Connected World survey,
it would appear that most AUPs are ineffective for another
reason: Workers don’t think they play a role in helping
the enterprise to enforce such policies. The research
reveals that three in five employees (61 percent) believe
they’re not responsible for protecting corporate information
and devices; instead, their view is that IT and/or service
providers are accountable. So the question is, what’s the
point of having an AUP?

“The current trend with AUPs is that businesses are
taking a much more risk-based approach,” says Nilesh
Bhandari, product manager for Cisco. “Companies are
honing in on what they absolutely must include in an
AUP, and what makes the most sense for the business,
especially in terms of time and cost required to monitor
employees’ adherence to the policy.”

“Acceptable use policies are important for many reasons,
including for regulatory compliance, but most aren’t
realistic,” says Gavin Reid, Cisco CSIRT manager. “Too
many are long laundry lists filled with ‘you-can’t-do-this’
items. They are really just a way for the enterprise to say
to the employee, their legal department, or investigators,
in the event of a security incident, ‘Well, we said not to
do that.’”

He adds that a well-defined AUP is easier for
employees to understand and follow—and it gives the
company greater leverage with its workforce. “Users
will pay attention to an AUP when they fully understand
what will happen if they fail to adhere to the policy,”
says Bhandari.

Myth vs. Reality:

AUPs Cannot Be Enforced
Myth:
AUPs have no impact because they cannot be
enforced—and they are simply too difficult for
the enterprise to create in the first place.
Reality:
Organizations cannot effectively enforce catchall policies. While it does take time and research
to determine what an AUP should include and
whether or not each item truly can be enforced,
the end result will be a policy that is easier for
employees to understand and follow—and that
is more likely to enhance enterprise security.
Special focus should be given to educating
employees on safe use of email and the web,
as these are avenues cybercriminals typically
take to infiltrate and infect networks, steal
intellectual property and other sensitive data,
and compromise individual users.

“The current trend with AUPs is that businesses
are taking a much more risk-based approach.”

Getting Started with
Collaboration Security
Enterprises can use the following steps to help
establish security policies, technologies, and
processes related to collaboration and social
media security:
• Create a business plan for collaboration and
social networking solutions, starting with the
business need.
• Craft clear security governance mechanisms
for collaboration.
• Create policies on information confidentiality
and expectations for employee activity when
interacting on collaboration sites.
• Define policies on network security measures,
such as remote access by mobile devices,
level of password protection, and use of direct
file sharing.
• Identify regulatory and compliance
requirements that might restrict use of or
information disclosure on social media.
• Create training resources for all users.

Social Media: Policies Paired with Technology Controls
Judging from the results of the Connected World study,
college students and young professionals are likely to
find ways around restrictions on social media access
if it suits their needs—regardless of corporate policies.
Three in four employees surveyed believe their companies
should allow them to access social media and personal
sites with their work-issued devices.
Additionally, 40 percent of college students said they
would break a company’s social media rules. That’s a
significant slice of the potential workforce surveyed in
this study—and it serves as a warning to enterprises as
they grapple with their AUPs for social media. In other
words, you can ban or restrict social media, but odds
are good that your employees will access it anyway.
Organizations with AUPs that put a stranglehold on social
media access for employees will likely find it hard to
attract the best and the brightest young talent. Twentynine percent of students surveyed said they would
decline a job offer from a company that did not allow
them to access social media during working hours. And
of those students who would accept such a job, only
30 percent said they would abide by the stated policies.
“Access to social media and technology freedom of
choice will become make-or-break benefits for younger
workers considering where to start their careers,” says
Chris Young, senior vice president for the Security
Group at Cisco. “HR organizations need to account for
these factors in corporate culture and policy to retain a
competitive edge. Enterprises should define a realistic
compromise between the desires of employees to
share and the business requirements of maintaining
IT security, data, privacy, and asset protection.”

20

Cisco 2011 Annual Security Report

Such a compromise involves granting access to social
media and other collaboration technologies while using
technology controls to deflect threats such as malware
or phishing messages. In most cases, the security
settings in social networks are controlled by users, not
by IT. To compensate for this lack of control, additional
security measures can be implemented—for instance, an
intrusion prevention system to protect against network
threats, and reputation filtering to detect suspicious
activity and content.
Technology controls should be paired with user
training that clarifies the enterprise’s expectations for
appropriate behavior and practices while accessing
social media on company devices or via company
networks. As discussed earlier (see “Social Media:
Now, It’s a Productivity Tool,” page 8), young
professionals have become so comfortable sharing
information in the social media environment that they
may not realize—nor have they ever been taught—that
even small pieces of information posted on a social
network can cause damage to a business. Lack of both
user training about collaboration security concerns and
guidelines for disclosing information online can be
causes for this risk exposure.

Cyber Threat Outlook for 2012: The Hacktivism Factor
Today’s enterprises are grappling with an array of
security issues brought about by changing attitudes
and work habits among their employees, and the
dynamics of a more collaborative, connected, and
mobile world. As this half of the Cisco 2011 Annual
Security Report will examine, enterprises also must
continue to protect against a wide range of potent
threats that cybercriminals are already reaping
rewards from, and are investing additional resources
in refining—among them are advanced persistent
threats (APTs), data theft Trojans, and web exploits.
However, enterprises now must consider another
potential security threat that could be even more
disruptive to their operations if they were to be
targeted: hacktivism.
“Hacktivism is a morph of traditional hacking,” says
John N. Stewart, vice president and chief security
officer for Cisco. “Hackers used to hack for fun and
notoriety. Then, it was for a prize or monetary gain.
Now, it’s often about sending a message, and you
may never know what made you a target. We’re
defending a new domain now.”
Hacktivism—a blend of hacking and activism—
catapulted to the top tier of security concerns in
late 2010 when supporters of WikiLeaks.org launched
distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against
institutions such as PayPal and MasterCard; the initiative
was dubbed “Operation Payback.”12 In many ways,
hacktivism is a natural extension of how people are
using the Internet today—to connect with like-minded
people all over the globe. The Internet serves as
a powerful platform for those who want to make a

statement and grab the attention of a wide audience,
and motivate others to pursue similar actions.
(See “Social Media Wields ‘Gathering’ Power,” on
opposite page.)
Behind Operation Payback was a group known as
the Anonymous collective, which has been growing
in both membership and influence worldwide ever
since. (For more on Anonymous, see the “Cisco
Cybercrime Showcase,” on page 24.) Most recently,
Anonymous has been connected to the Occupy
Wall Street movement.13 The “Occupy” protests
began in New York City, but quickly spawned similar
gatherings in more than 900 cities around the world.
Activists representing the Anonymous collective have
encouraged members to participate in the movement,
which generally has been peaceful, but has led to
violent clashes with law enforcement in some cities,
including Rome, Italy,14 and Oakland, California.15
At times, factions of Anonymous that identify with
the Occupy movement have threatened greater
disruption, such as hacking campaigns to halt the
operations of major financial exchanges.
Incidents of hacktivism by other groups in the last
year have helped to elevate this threat to the top tier
of cyber threat concerns for enterprises. LulzSec,
for example, focused its efforts on law enforcement
organizations, executing DDoS attacks and data theft
against a U.K. cybercrime organization and Arizona
law enforcement.16 In July, a related group, known as
“Script Kiddies,” hacked Fox News Twitter accounts
to post that U.S. President Barack Obama had been
assassinated.17

Hacktivism can happen quickly and without warning
—although Anonymous did announce some of its
intended targets, such as HBGary Federal, a firm
hired by the U.S. federal government to track down
cyberactivists targeting organizations that had
pulled support from WikiLeaks.org. While the threat
of hacktivism may seem remote, it’s very real, and
represents a shift in the nature of cybercrime itself.
“Understanding criminal motivation has been a guiding
principle in charting security strategy. However, the
hacktivists’ goal of mayhem undermines this model,
as any enterprise can be targeted at any time for any
reason by anybody,” explains Patrick Peterson, senior
security researcher for Cisco. “What an enterprise
would try to protect from being compromised in
a ‘traditional’ security breach, such as intellectual
property, may be of no interest to this type of hacker.
The ‘value’ derived from the action is when the hacker
can disrupt, embarrass, or make an example of their
target—or all of the above.”
Stewart adds, “Planning ahead for an incident of
hacktivism means creating a clear action plan that
outlines what the organization would say and do after
an event has occurred. Developing this plan should be
a cross-functional effort that includes management,
security teams, legal, and even communications
professionals. If this happens to your business, handle
it well, as it can result in lasting damage to your brand.
As is true with many things, be prepared and have
your game plan in place before an incident occurs.”

Geopolitical Trends: Social Media Wields “Gathering” Power
If anyone still needed evidence that social media
can spark social change at lightning speed, 2011
was the year that this power was proven. The “Arab
Spring” protests early in the year, and the riots in
London and other British cities during the summer,
showed that social media disseminates calls to
action like no other medium before it. In both cases,
Twitter and Facebook were used to drive attendance
at public gatherings—and, also in both cases,
government entities suggested blocking access to
social media by cutting off Internet access or seizing
personal account records.

in the current global environment of frustration toward
perceived privileged groups, this increases both
physical and virtual security concerns.”

A September 2011 University of Washington study
found that social media, especially Twitter, “played a
central role in shaping political debates in the Arab
Spring,” particularly in Egypt and Tunisia, according to
the study’s summary. “Conversations about revolution
often preceded major events on the ground, and
social media carried inspiring stories of protest across
international borders.”18 Social media watchers expect
this trend to continue, as anti-government frustration
finds a voice in social media networks.19

Also on enterprises’ radar is the increasing tendency
of government organizations to seek to block social
media or even Internet service on a broad scale, or
request access to social media account or mobile
device information that is normally private. For example,
during the riots in the United Kingdom, people used
BlackBerry Messenger (BBM), the instant messaging
service for BlackBerry users, to trade information
about sites to loot, or where protestors should gather.
BBM is encrypted phone-to-phone messaging that,
generally speaking, is harder for law enforcement
authorities to trace. RIM, BlackBerry’s creator, agreed
to cooperate with U.K. police teams trying to identify
BBM users who advocated riots or looting, although
the company did not say what type of BBM account
information it would disclose.20

The implications for enterprises and for their security
lie in the possibility of social media being used to
cause upheaval within their own organizations or
toward their brands or industries. (See “Cyber Threat
Outlook for 2012: The Hacktivism Factor,” page 22.)
“The perception of anonymity online increases the risk
of unintended consequences if so-called netizens feel
at liberty to lay blame but skip fact-checking,” says
Cisco global threat analyst Jean Gordon Kocienda.
“For companies and corporate executives, particularly

In addition, enterprises can expect to undergo serious
business disruption if offices or employees are based
in areas undergoing such upheaval—for instance, lack
of Internet access if local authorities shut it down as
a security measure. It’s also possible organizations
seen as aiding or abetting a corrupt regime could be
targeted, or could suffer a backlash if they are viewed
as trying to stifle a revolutionary movement.

In the aftermath of the riots, British officials warned
that, in the future, the government might request
extended police powers to curb unrest, and proposed
asking social media providers to restrict access to
their services during such emergency situations.

Twitter responded by pointing to a blog post from
earlier in 2011 affirming the company’s commitment
to keeping the service up and running no matter
what world-shaking events were being discussed
via tweets: “We don’t always agree with the things
people choose to tweet, but we keep the information
flowing irrespective of any view we may have about
the content.”21
Security watchers anticipate a tug-of-war between
governments—which will increasingly demand access
to user data in order to maintain law and order—
and privacy advocates, who will protest any such
disclosures from technology providers. As an example,
India has expressed concern over its ability to access
such data (for instance, to track terrorist activity), and
has made an agreement with RIM that the government
can request the company’s private user data on a
case-by-case basis. The European Data Retention
Directive, which was created in 2006 and calls for
communications data to be retained in case it is
needed by law enforcement authorities, has been
implemented by some countries in the European
Union, yet delayed by others.22
“What is clear is that governments globally are
struggling to apply the new facts of technology and
communications to the underlying principles of law
and society,” says Adam Golodner, director of global
security and technology policy for Cisco. “This has
always been the case as technology moves forward,
and in cyber, this application of the new facts to the
old principles will be the core policy issue for the
foreseeable future.”

Cisco 2011 Annual Security Report

THE

GOOD

Microsoft

Microsoft’s technology has always attracted the
attention of criminals because of its pervasiveness in
the enterprise and among consumers. In particular,
botnet owners have exploited the Windows operating
system using social engineering, web-based attacks,
and unpatched vulnerabilities. In recent years, Microsoft
has fought back against botnets in three big ways.
First, Microsoft has dramatically
improved product security. Key
developments include aggressive
vulnerability discovery and weekly
patch cycles; implementation of
Microsoft Security Development
Lifecycle (SDL) to dramatically
increase product security; auto-update systems
for all of Microsoft’s software products; significant
changes to Windows Internet Explorer, including
a new security model for ActiveX controls; and
development of the Malicious Software Removal Tool
(MSRT), which surgically removes malware from
PCs. MSRT has been deployed against malware
families powering more than 150 of the world’s
largest botnets, including Zeus (Zbot), Cutwail,
Waledac and Koobface, to remove hundreds of
millions of PC malware infections. Cisco research
has shown massive declines year over year in
web exploit toolkits’ successful exploitation of
Microsoft technologies.
Second, Microsoft has led the security community in
the fight against cybercrime. Microsoft’s Digital Crimes
Unit hosts the annual Digital Crimes Consortium (DCC),
which provides an opportunity for law enforcement
officials and members of the technology security
community to discuss enforcement efforts involving
cybercrime worldwide. This year’s event included
340 attendees from 33 countries.

Third, Microsoft has aggressively pursued legal actions
against cybercriminals. In 2010, Microsoft took legal
action to shut down the Waledac botnet—which had
infected hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide
and was sending as many as 1.5 billion spam messages
daily—by asking a federal judge to file a restraining
order against almost 300 Internet domains believed to
be controlled by Waledac-related criminals. This action
cut off communications between the botnet’s commandand-control centers and its compromised computers,
effectively “killing” the botnet.23
In early 2011, Microsoft lawyers and U.S. marshals seized
command-and-control servers for the Rustock botnet,
which were housed at several web-hosting providers
across the United States. Malware promulgated by
Rustock, which was operated by Russian criminals and
mostly delivered fake pharmaceuticals spam, dropped
dramatically, and the botnet’s activity slowed to a halt.
Additionally, Microsoft offered a US$250,000 reward for
information leading to the arrest of Rustock’s creators.24
According to the Cisco IronPort SenderBase Security
Network, since Rustock has been sidelined, daily spam
volume worldwide has dropped dramatically.
In September 2011, Microsoft used similar legal tactics
to shut down the Kelihos botnet—and in legal filings
actually named a defendant for the first time, calling
out the alleged owner of the web domain controlling
the botnet.25
Microsoft’s anti-botnet actions—combined with the
company’s record numbers of vulnerability patch
releases, which also help clamp down on criminal
activity—have turned it into a cybercrime crusader.
The company’s Project MARS (Microsoft Active
Response for Security), which oversees these botnet
takedown efforts, also has shared its findings about
botnets with members of the security industry.

THE

BAD

Anonymous

Anonymous, described as a “decentralized online
community acting anonymously in a coordinated manner,”
is a “loose coalition of Internet denizens” that has been
around for several years, but making headlines more
often lately as the group becomes increasingly associated
with collaborative, international hacktivism. (For more
on hacktivism, see “Cyber Threat Outlook for 2012:
The Hacktivism Factor,” page 22.)
Those who identify with the Anonymous
collective are located all over the world
and connect with one another through
Internet forums, imageboards, and other
web-based venues such as 4chan,
711chan, Encyclopedia Dramatica, IRC
channels, and even mainstream sites such as YouTube
and Facebook. “This is a group that is fairly well
organized, yet loosely affiliated,” says Patrick Peterson,
senior security researcher for Cisco. “The people
involved are highly talented—and incredibly ambitious.
In many cases, their actions are not motivated by profit.
It’s more a case of ‘Look what I can do.’ And when
they’re done, they disassemble and disappear as quickly
as they came together.”

In 2011, Anonymous has been associated with a number
of high-profile hacking incidents, some announced in
advance and all intended to make a statement, including
direct attacks on the websites of:

the Anonymous mix who truly want to cause
damage—or if the group takes things one step too
far when trying to make a statement—there could
be a real problem.”

• Numerous U.S. law enforcement organizations,
which resulted in the release of peace officer
and confidential informant personal information

Consider this almost-incident that had the potential
to send shockwaves through an already uncertain
global economy: In October, factions of Anonymous
aimed big by threatening to “erase” the New York
Stock Exchange on October 10, 2011, through a
distributed DDoS attack in a show of support for
the Occupy Wall Street movement.26 One possible
reason the group did not carry through with its
promise to bring down the exchange is because
“the rallying cry drew out criticism from supporters
and detractors alike, with most decrying the effort.”27
So it would appear that Anonymous, loosely
connected as it is right now, can be influenced by
its collective conscience not to inflict serious
damage—at least, in this case.

• The government of Tunisia, as part of the
“Arab Spring” movement (see “Social Media
Wields ‘Gathering’ Power,” page 23)
• Security firm HBGary Federal
• Sony Computer Entertainment America
What threat does Anonymous pose moving forward?
“This group has the ability to inflict real damage,” says
Scott Olechowski, threat research manager for Cisco.
“Most of what we’ve seen from them so far hasn’t been
too extreme—arguably, more disruption than the actual
damage they are capable of. You could define them as
mischievous right now. But if you add some people into

“The people involved are highly talented — and incredibly
ambitious. In many cases, their actions are not motivated
by profit. It’s more a case of ‘Look what I can do.’”

Potentials: Mass Account Compromise, a
newcomer to this year’s Cisco CROI Matrix,
essentially involves cybercriminals “making use
of table scraps left from data theft,” according to Patrick
Peterson, senior security researcher for Cisco. They
piece together information gathered from data theft
Trojans to extract low-value username/password
credentials. The credentials are then used as “stepping
stones” to find credential reuse on a valuable online
banking site, or to use webmail credentials to spy on a
victim’s personal email in order to lay groundwork for a
more aggressive action. “Cybercriminals are looking at
the tons and tons of information they’re collecting in a
different way. They’re now thinking, ‘Could this webmail
or dating site username/password I have be the skeleton
key to a high-value account? Or could it be a stepping
stone for a webmail exploit that will allow me to do other
things, like password resets and reconnaissance, that
could lead to even bigger prizes?” says Peterson.

Cisco 2011 Annual Security Report

The Cisco CROI Matrix tracks the performance of
financially motivated cybercrime operations, which
increasingly are managed and organized in ways
similar to sophisticated, legitimate businesses. This
matrix specifically highlights the types of aggressive
actions Cisco security experts predict cybercriminals
are likely to focus most of their resources toward
developing, refining, and deploying in the year ahead.

Cybercriminals are also accelerating investment in VoIP
and other telephony abuse techniques. As reported
in the Cisco 2010 Annual Security Report, many
miscreants already have found success in targeting
small or midsize businesses with this technique, causing
significant financial losses for some organizations. VoIP
Abuse, which was listed as a “Potential” on last year’s
matrix, involves the hacking of private branch exchange
(PBX) systems. VoIP abusers place fraudulent, longdistance calls—usually international calls. Some criminals
use VoIP systems for more sophisticated “vishing”
scams (telephone-based phishing), designed to collect
sensitive information from users, such as Social Security
numbers. Caller ID spoofing attacks against phonebased verification systems are also on the rise.

Rising Stars: Money Laundering (Muling)
is expected to remain a key focus area for
cybercrime investment in 2012. Discussed in
detail in the Cisco 2010 Annual Security Report, criminals
leveraging data theft malware have access to numerous
online bank accounts but face a bottleneck in extracting
funds safely overseas without leaving a direct trail.28
Money mules provide this solution. Muling operations
have become increasingly elaborate and international in
scope recently with some of the best data coming from
“Operation Trident Breach,” the arrest of more than 60
cybercriminals who successfully stole US$70 million
using money mules.29 While it is estimated that only one
in three money mule transactions are successful—and
money mules are easy to arrest, at least in the United
States—mule networks continue to grow as real criminals
have plenty of bank accounts and mules to burn.
A not-so-surprising newcomer among the “Rising Stars”
is Mobile Devices, which was listed in the “Potentials”
category in the 2010 matrix. Cybercriminals, as a
rule, focus their attention on where the users are, and
increasingly, people are accessing the Internet, email,
and corporate networks via powerful mobile devices.
Mobile device attacks have been around for years
now, but historically have not been widespread, and
were more akin to research projects than successful
cybercrime businesses. But that’s changing—fast.
Mobile campaigns not only are becoming more prevalent,
but also, successful—and therefore, important to cybercriminals. New mobile OS platforms present new security
vulnerabilities to exploit. Many cybercriminals are reaping
rewards with fake mobile applications that serve up malware.
And with mobile devices quickly replacing traditional PCs
as business computing tools, cybercriminals are investing
more resources in developing APTs to exploit two-factor
authorization and help them gain access to corporate
networks where they can steal data and/or conduct
“reconnaissance missions.”

Meanwhile, as more businesses embrace cloud computing
and hosted services, cybercriminals are also looking to
the cloud in search of moneymaking opportunities with
Cloud Infrastructure Hacking. “Criminals see the potential
to get more return on their investment with cloud attacks,”
says Scott Olechowski, threat research manager for Cisco.
“Why focus all your efforts on hacking into one enterprise
when you can compromise hosted infrastructure and
potentially access information belonging to hundreds or
even thousands of companies?”
Olechowski adds that recent data security incidents—
such as hackers gaining access to customer names and
email addresses stored in the systems of email marketer
Epsilon Data Management LLC30—underscore the
growing trend toward “hack one to hack them all.”
Cash Cows: Two of 2010’s “Rising Stars”—
Data Theft Trojans and Web Exploits—have
made their way to the 2011 “Cash Cows”
category, as they are now among the favorite moneymakers for cybercriminals. But this move isn’t just
because criminals have perfected their skills with these
techniques; the prevalence of cheap and easy-to-use
web exploit toolkits and data theft Trojan exploits means
anyone who wants to get into the game can do so with
relatively little effort or investment. Other old favorites
such as Spyware/Scareware and Click/Redirect Fraud
have lost a little luster, but maintained their role as loyal
workhorses for cybercriminals during 2011—and will
continue to do so in 2012.
Dogs: Two new entrants to the “Dogs”
category are Pharma Spam and Advanced
Fee Fraud. Pharma spam, a “Cash Cow” in
the 2010 Cisco CROI Matrix, has fallen out of favor due to
law enforcement activities and botnet shutdowns. (See
the Cisco Cybercrime Showcase, “The Good: Microsoft,”
page 24.) Numerous pharma spam criminals have been
arrested or have gone underground to avoid capture,

including Igor Gusev of SpamIt/Glavmed; Pavel
Vrublevsky of RX-Promotions/Eva Pharmacy; Oleg
Nikolaenko, operator of the massive Mega-D botnet;
Georg Avanesov, operator of the Bredolab botnet; and
many others. With so many of the once-massive botnets
such as Waledac, Mariposa, Cutwail (reportedly the
largest botnet ever), Rustock, Bredolab, and Mega-D
either long gone or severely crippled, and authorities
more vigilantly scanning the horizon for prolific spammers,
pushing out pharma spam simply does not generate the
returns it used to for cybercriminals.31
Meanwhile, another “Cash Cow” from last year,
Advanced Fee Fraud, is now making its way toward the
exit door. Today’s users are simply better educated—
and spam filters are better tuned—which means this
technique is no longer delivering significant returns to
cybercriminal operations. The labor-intensive “Nigerian
prince” scam still runs, but profits continue to decline.
Old dogs still hanging around on the matrix are Phishing
1.0 scams and DDoS attacks. Social Networking Attacks
continue to take a backseat as users become even
savvier about navigating the online “Social Sphere.”
Many more users are now instinctively less trusting of
others they don’t know who try to interact with them on
social networks. They also are taking advantage of privacy
controls from their social network providers, and generally,
being less open when sharing personal information on
these sites. Social networking attacks will not fade away
completely, but sophisticated cybercriminals are unlikely to
continue investing their resources in refining or expanding
such exploits. Making these types of scams work has
simply become too labor-intensive and time-consuming,
especially now that many in the shadow economy are
making a specific effort to be more strategic when
investing their resources.

2011 Vulnerability and Threat Analysis
The Cisco Annual Security Report provides a
comparison of the rise and fall of vulnerabilities and
threats by category, as well as the estimated impact
of these exploits.
The Vulnerability and Threat Categories chart below
shows a slight increase in recorded vulnerabilities and
threats—a significant trend, since they generally have
been on the decline since 2008. One factor causing the
increase is vulnerabilities in major software vendors’ open
source packages or code, such as those using the open
source browser engine WebKit. A single vulnerability in
an open source product like WebKit can impact multiple
major products and result in multiple advisories, updates,
and patches. Apple continued to release large updates
this year for several of its products, relating to the
inclusion of open source software.

Vulnerability and Threat Categories

Going into 2012, security experts are watching
vulnerabilities in industrial control systems and
supervisory control and data acquisition systems,
also known as ICS/SCADA systems. These systems
present a growing area of concern, and government
cyber defense initiatives are focused on addressing
these vulnerabilities. As reported in the Cisco 2010
Annual Security Report, the Stuxnet network worm was
designed to infect and tamper with these systems.
The good news for 2011 is a decline in basic coding
errors: buffer overflows, denial of service, arbitrary
code execution, and format string vulnerabilities.
However, this does not include vulnerabilities and
corrections related to flaws that allow SQL injection
attacks, which continue to be a widespread problem.

Cisco IntelliShield Alert Urgency Ratings reflect
the level of threat activity related to specific
vulnerabilities. 2011 is notable for a significant spike
in Urgency 3, meaning a limited number of exploits
were detected, but additional exploits still could be
possible. This increase indicates that while there are
a greater number of active threats in circulation on
the Internet, they generally do not rise to the level of

Global Spam Update:
Dramatic Decline in Spam Volume

The impact on the business of cybercrime is
significant: Cisco SIO estimates that the cybercriminal benefit resulting from traditional mass
email-based attacks declined more than 50 percent
(on an annualized basis) from June 2010 to June
2011—from US$1.1 billion to US$500 million.32

The new smaller botnets still aim to gather bank
account information, as the larger Zeus botnets do.
However, the number and variety of these smaller
botnets make it challenging for security professionals
to track their movements.

200B

Oct-10

Instead of just a few very large botnets, usually managed
by established criminal enterprises, there are now dozens
of smaller botnets engaging in criminal activity. “When
there were only a few large botnets in existence, it was
easier to track them and understand how they operated,”
says Jeff Shipley, manager for Cisco Security Research
and Operations. “The availability of botnet toolkits has
greatly increased the number of botnets, allowed more
variations, and complicates the task of analyzing their
behavior patterns and providing protection from them.”

Sep-10

As discussed in the Cisco 2010 Annual Security Report,
large botnets such as Zeus—which commandeered as
many as 2 million to 3 million computers worldwide—
have been used to steal banking information and login
data for years. Recently, botnet creators have launched
attack toolkits, in which botnet code is built in, enabling
the creation of a host of smaller botnets.

Before 2011, some cybercriminals had already
started to shift their focus toward more targeted
attacks, using their resources to reach out to specific
people in an organization (such as financial or IT
personnel) with a scam message designed to obtain
sensitive network login data or other account
information. Targeted scams need only a single
response from a recipient to be considered
successful, whereas mass spam campaigns require
a much higher response rate to be profitable.

Aug-10

Threats and exploits also are more narrowly focused, as
opposed to widespread exploits involving Internet worms
and malicious code. The threats tend to be associated
with attack toolkits, which assist in launching attacks
using individual vulnerabilities on individual systems.

But events over the past year have disrupted
traditional spammers’ business models so
significantly that many have been forced to channel
their resources toward developing targeted attacks.
Beginning in 2010 and continuing into 2011, law
enforcement authorities and security organizations
around the world have been working closely together
to shut down or severely limit the activity of some of
the biggest spam-sending botnets. SpamIt, a large
spam-sending affiliate network, closed down in
2010 after Russian police pressed charges against
its owner. In addition, major botnets were crippled or
shut down, including Rustock, Bredolab, and Mega-D.

Thanks to criminals’ preference for targeted
campaigns, spam does not appear to be as lucrative
as it used to be. According to Cisco Security
Intelligence Operations (SIO), spam volume dropped
from more than 379 billion messages daily to about
124 billion messages daily between August 2010
and November 2011—levels not seen since 2007.

Spam Volume by Country: 2011 Highlights
Cisco SIO also tracks spam volume originating
from countries worldwide. As of September 2011,
India had the highest percentage of spam volume
(13.9 percent). In 2010, the country ranked second in
spam volume, behind the United States, which saw
its spam volume drop dramatically from January to
September 2011, from 10.1 percent to 3.2 percent.
The United States now ranks ninth in total spam
volume worldwide.
Holding second place on this year’s list of spam
nations is the Russian Federation, with 7.8 percent.
Its spam volume increased during the first half of
2011, rising from 7.6 percent in January to a peak
of 9 percent in May, but has been experiencing a
steady decline in volume since.

China, which was seventh on the list in 2010, maintains
the same position in the current lineup. However, while
that country’s spam volume has increased only slightly
overall, from 3.6 percent in December 2010 to 4.7
percent in September 2011, it was by far the highestranking spam nation for a short period this year. From
May to June, China’s total spam volume leapt from
1.1 percent to just over 10 percent. Its spam volume
peaked at 18 percent in July, and then edged down to
11.5 percent in August before dropping dramatically
to 4.7 percent percent in September.

Third on the list for 2011 is Vietnam, which, like India
and the Russian Federation, was among the top five
spam nations in the Cisco 2010 Annual Security Report.
Vietnam’s spam volume hovered between 3 and
4 percent for much of the year, but then jumped to
nearly 6 percent in August 2011 and grew again
to nearly 8 percent in September 2011.

Cisco SIO’s research also reveals that Brazil had
spam volume of about 4.5 percent in September
2011. Brazil now ranks eighth among the top spam
nations, after topping the list in 2009 and earning
third place on last year’s list. However, the country’s
spam volumes did fluctuate throughout 2011, nearly
doubling to 8 percent by April 2011 before beginning
a steady decline to 4.5 percent.

The Cisco Global ARMS Race Index
The Cisco Global ARMS Race Index

The annual Cisco Global ARMS Race Index, inspired
by the Richter Scale used to measure earthquake
magnitude, tracks “Adversary Resource Market Share”
(ARMS). The index provides a way to measure the
overall level of compromised resources worldwide—
the networks and machines currently under “adversarial
control.” Cisco security experts created the index as
a way to gain a better understanding of overall trends
based on the global online criminal community’s
activities and their rates of success at compromising
both enterprise and individual users.
According to data collected for this year’s index,
the aggregate number that represents the level of
compromised resources at the end of 2011 is 6.5, down
slightly from the December 2010 level of 6.8. When the
Cisco Global ARMS Race Index debuted in the Cisco
2009 Annual Security Report, the aggregate number
was 7.2, which meant enterprise networks at the time
were experiencing persistent infections, and consumer
systems were infected at levels capable of producing
consistent and alarming levels of service abuse.
Since then, consumer and enterprise systems have seen
a constant decline in infection rate, but levels are still
between “capable of producing consistent and alarming
levels of service abuse” and “capable of broad (but not
sustained) high-level service abuse.” Unfortunately, the
magnitude decline does not tell the whole story, as each
copy of a criminal’s APT malware is doing far more
damage than in years past.
What’s behind this year’s decline in the level of
compromised resources worldwide? The decrease
in the number of massive botnets driven by law
enforcement and botnet takedowns has had a significant
impact. As discussed earlier in this report, sophisticated

9.5+: More resources are under rogue control than
legitimate control. Inability to trust any connection
or application. All services are readily deniable.
9-9.5: Nearly every network, every machine type,
every user type, in all regions is infected at
significant levels. Widespread resource abuse
is common.
8: Enterprise networks are widely and continuously
infected. Consumer systems are heavily
infected, with traditional security programs
proving ineffective. Large simultaneous attacks
on many high-visibility targets are possible.
7: Enterprise networks are experiencing persistent
infections. Consumer systems are infected at
levels capable of producing consistent and
alarming levels of service abuse.
6: Enterprise networks are infrequently infected.
Consumer systems have significant infection
levels and are capable of broad (but not
sustained) high-level service abuse.
5: Enterprise networks are rarely infected.
Consumer systems are experiencing annoying
but not alarming infections; targeted service
abuse is possible.
1-4: Enterprise networks are virtually not infected.
Consumers have nominal levels of infection
and barely noticeable abuse.

criminal operations are moving away from the massive
botnets commonplace in years past because law
enforcement and the security industry are keeping a
close watch on this activity. However, many smaller
botnets have been developed—with each one capable
of inflicting more damage per bot.
Additionally, many in the shadow economy now center
their efforts on infecting specific high-value targets with
APTs and launching targeted attacks that are more likely
to yield a lucrative payout. The prevalence of featurerich data theft malware such as Zeus/SpyEye has
enabled many criminal gangs to launch such attacks.
“The ‘Ocean’s 11’ gangs are out there,” says Patrick
Peterson, senior security researcher for Cisco. “They’re
focusing tremendous energy on compromising a small
number of high-value targets versus the carpetbombing techniques of the past.”

Methodology
To arrive at this year’s measurement on the 10-point
Cisco Global ARMS Race Index, Cisco relied on leading
botnet-tracking estimates of total bots and other data
points derived through internal research and other expert
sources, such as The Shadowserver Foundation, which
tracks cybercriminal activity and is composed of volunteer
security professionals from around the world. The
methodology for the Global ARMS Race Index is based on:
• Current aggregate botnet size
• Statistics used to estimate the total number of
Internet-connected systems in the world
• Estimates of home and work infection rates, which
measure factors such as resource availability

According to the Cisco Global ARMS Race Index, the level of
resources under adversarial control worldwide was 6.5 at the
end of 2011. This is a decline from the 2010 level of 6.8,
showing that infections of enterprise networks and consumer
systems are less frequent compared to 12 months ago.

The Internet:
A Fundamental Human Necessity?
2011 saw the Internet being used in new and powerful
ways—in particular, to bring together people on a mass
scale to create change that has altered the landscape of
our global community. Its influence on our everyday life,
both work and personal, is only growing as well. So it
begs the question: If we have become so reliant on the
Internet and its power to connect us with information
and people from anywhere in the world, is it now a
fundamental human necessity?
According to one in three college students and young
professionals surveyed for Cisco’s Connected World
study, it is. In fact, they consider it to be as important to
their lives as air, water, food, and shelter. To some, this
attitude may seem extreme, but more than likely, it is
a view that will be commonplace among those in the
next-generation workforce. While today we observe how
the line between personal and professional use of the
Internet and Web 2.0 tools and technologies is blurring,
soon there may be no discernible delineation whatsoever.
Meanwhile, there is no question that for today’s businesses,
the Internet is a necessity—for both basic operations and
competitive advantage. For that reason alone, it would
seem there should be no debate in the enterprise around
whether any technology that will significantly enhance
productivity, efficiency, and innovation—and the satisfaction
of workers—should be embraced and put in use strategically
throughout the organization. However, many businesses
are finding it difficult to adapt to so much change so
quickly. They cite security concerns as a primary hurdle

to leveraging new technologies. But many are beginning
to understand that a wait-and-see approach, while meant
to protect the enterprise and its assets, may actually
undermine their competitive edge—if not now, then
definitely in the future.
Moving too slowly doesn’t just mean that enterprises
risk taking advantage of innovations that can help their
business achieve new levels of success. They also risk
not being able to recruit or retain their most important
asset: talent. As discussed in this report, many of today’s
employees would be inclined not to take a job if a potential
employer told them their access to corporate networks
and applications would be severely limited or prohibited.
(See “Remote Access and BYOD: Enterprises Working
to Find Common Ground with Employees,” page 10.)
Likewise, more than half of college students surveyed
for the Connected World study said if they encountered
a company that banned access to social media, they
would either not accept a job with that organization,
or would join and find a way to access social media
despite corporate policies. (See “Social Media: Now It’s
a Productivity Tool,” page 8.)

But many enterprises are trying to change. Cisco
security experts interviewed for the 2011 Annual Security
Report have reported seeing many firms making strides
in both evolving their security model so it is relevant for
today’s connected world, and in trying to find common
ground with employees who are demanding access to
applications and devices that they want to use for work.
They’re also re-evaluating their AUPs and business
codes of conduct, reinvigorating their DLP efforts, and
taking the enterprise security discussion—and the
responsibility for preserving desired levels of security—
beyond the IT function and into departments throughout
the organization, from marketing to human resources
and legal right up to the management level.
As we’ve learned in this report, Cisco is among them.
Like countless organizations worldwide, it is working to
find the right balance between seizing new opportunities
and maintaining network and data security. Cisco’s
“Any Device” initiative, designed to allow the company’s
employees greater choice in devices, while maintaining
a common, predictable user experience that maintains or
enhances global organizational competitiveness and

“The rapid erosion of this perimeter that took
20 years to build has left many enterprises
stunned and feeling vulnerable as they
embark on the BYOD journey.”

disrupters and criminals to connect and assemble quickly,
anonymously, and unpredictably for a specific goal that
may not be motivated by money or have a purpose that
is easy for others, including targets, to decipher. “Some
of the things we’ve witnessed over the past year are like
nothing we’ve ever seen before,” says Gavin Reid, Cisco
CSIRT manager. “Some events have been absolutely
crushing, and this is not a good sign.”

security, is an important start. However, even building
the foundation for movement toward a BYOD model can
be a challenge.
“Modern smartphones and tablets are a huge IT disruption,”
says Ofer Elzam, integrated security solutions architect
for Cisco. “Enterprises are conditioned to maintaining
a defined security perimeter and fiercely protecting
everything inside of it. The rapid erosion of this perimeter
that took 20 years to build has left many enterprises
stunned and feeling vulnerable as they embark on the
BYOD journey.”

In many ways, their feelings of vulnerability are not
misplaced. While living in a connected world means
we are closer to our co-workers, business partners,
customers, friends, and family, we and the organizations
we work for and do business with are also within easier
reach of the criminal economy. The openness and
interconnectedness that mobile devices, social networks,
and Web 2.0 applications support provide new avenues
for malicious actors to steal from others, disrupt business,
or simply, make a statement.
Cybercriminals are investing more toward “R&D” to find
ways to use mobile devices and penetrate the cloud to
seize the data they need to make a profit or undermine a
company’s success. And as the hacktivism trend clearly
indicates, today’s technology allows like-minded social

Like our own planet, the connected world has a light
side and dark side at all times. Enterprise security can
exist here, but building an effective model requires new
thinking as well as some risk-taking—and maintaining it
demands more vigilance than ever before. The core
challenge for today’s businesses is that they must find
the right mix of technology and policy to meet their
unique combination of needs. This is not an easy
process, but the end result will be a more agile business
better prepared to adapt—both swiftly and securely—to
changes in technology that tomorrow inevitably will bring.
“The connected world is a more fluid world. And it’s literally
‘sink or swim’ time now for enterprises that have yet
to accept that change is no longer just at their door—it’s
already in their workplace,” says Chris Young, senior vice
president for the Security Group at Cisco. “By embracing
the technologies that their employees, and their
customers, inevitably will use, enterprises can create
a better overall security solution by addressing reality
instead of wondering about the ‘what if.’”

2012 Action Items for Enterprise Security
Even though organizations need to develop an
approach to network and data security that will
support the specific needs of their workforce and
help them to achieve key business objectives,
there are several things that any enterprise can do
to improve its security posture both immediately
and over the long term. Following are 10
recommendations from Cisco’s security experts:

1 Assess the totality of your network. “Know

where your IT infrastructure begins and ends—so
many enterprises simply have no idea of the entirety
of their network. Also, know what your ‘normal’ is so
you can quickly identify and respond to a problem.”

John N. Stewart, vice president and chief security officer for Cisco

2 Re-evaluate your acceptable use policy and

business code of conduct. “Get away from the
laundry list approach with security policies. Focus
only on those things you know you must and
can enforce.”

Gavin Reid, Cisco CSIRT manager

3 Determine what data must be protected.

“You cannot build an effective DLP program if
you don’t know what information in the enterprise
must be secured. You also must determine who in
the enterprise is allowed to have access to that
information, and how they are allowed to access it.”

David Paschich, web security product manager for Cisco

4 Know where your data is and understand how

(and if) it is being secured. “Identify every third party
that has permission to store your company’s data—
from cloud providers to email marketers—and confirm
that your information is being secured appropriately.
Compliance requirements, and now the trend in
cybercrime toward ‘hack one to hack them all,’
means enterprises must never assume their data
is secure, even when they put it in the hands of
those they trust.”

8 Create an incident response plan. “IT-related

risk should be treated like any other business risk.
This means enterprises need to have a clear plan
in place to respond quickly and appropriately to
any type of security event, whether it’s a data breach
resulting from a targeted attack, a compliance
violation due to an employee’s carelessness, or
an incident of hacktivism.”

Pat Calhoun, vice president and general manager of Cisco’s
Secure Network Services Business Unit

9 Implement security measures to help

Scott Olechowski, threat research manager for Cisco

5 Assess user education practices. “Long

seminars and handbooks aren’t effective. Younger
employees will be more receptive to a targeted
approach to user education, with shorter sessions
and ‘just-in-time’ training. Peer training also works
well in today’s collaborative work environment.”

compensate for lack of control over social
networks. “Do not underestimate the power of
technology controls, such as an intrusion prevention
system for protecting against network threats.
Reputation filtering is also an essential tool for
detecting suspicious activity and content.”

Rajneesh Chopra, director of product management,
Cisco Security Technology Group

David Evans, chief futurist for Cisco

6

Use egress monitoring. “This is a basic thing, but
not enough enterprises do it—although compliance
demands have more organizations adopting this
practice. Egress monitoring is a change in focus
from just blocking ‘the bad’ from coming in. You
monitor what is being sent out of your organization
and by whom and to where—and block things from
leaving that shouldn’t be.”
Jeff Shipley, manager for Cisco Security Research and Operations

7Prepare for the inevitability of BYOD.

“Organizations need to stop thinking about when
they are going to move to a BYOD model and start
thinking more about how.”

10 Monitor the dynamic risk landscape and

keep users informed. “Enterprises and their
security teams need to be vigilant about a much
broader range of risk sources, from mobile devices
and the cloud to social networking and whatever
new technology tomorrow may bring. They should
take a two-step approach: reacting to security
vulnerability disclosures, while also being proactive
about educating their employees on how to protect
themselves and the enterprise from persistent and
potent cyber threats.”

Ofer Elzam, integrated security solutions architect for Cisco

Nasrin Rezai, senior director of security architecture and chief
security officer for Cisco’s Collaboration Business Group

Cisco Security
Intelligence Operations
It has become an increasing challenge to manage
and secure today’s distributed and agile networks.
Online criminals are continuing to exploit users’ trust in
consumer applications and devices, increasing the risk
to organizations and employees. Traditional security,
which relies on layering of products and the use of
multiple filters, is not enough to defend against the
latest generation of malware, which spreads quickly, has
global targets, and uses multiple vectors to propagate.
Cisco stays ahead of the latest threats using real-time
threat intelligence from Cisco Security Intelligence
Operations (SIO). Cisco SIO is the world’s largest
cloud-based security ecosystem, using SensorBase
data of almost 1 million live data feeds from deployed
Cisco email, web, firewall, and intrusion prevention
system (IPS) solutions.

Cisco SecureX
The Cisco SecureX architecture is a next-generation,
context-aware framework that meets the evolving
security needs of borderless network environments.
Unlike legacy security architectures that were built
to enforce policies based on a single data point,
Cisco SecureX enforces policies based on the full
context of the situation. Context-aware policies use
a high-level language that aligns closely to business
policy. This greatly simplifies policy administration
while simultaneously providing more effective security
and control. As a result, networks are far more
secure, while business efficiency and flexibility are
maximized.
