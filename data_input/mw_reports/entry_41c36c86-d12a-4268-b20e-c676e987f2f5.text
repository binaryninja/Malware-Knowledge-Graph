Electric Company Ransomware Attack
appgate.com/blog/electric-company-ransomware-attack-calls-for-14-million-in-ransom

Light S.A., a Brazilian based electrical energy company was recently affected by
ransomware where the cybercriminals demanded a payment of 14 million U.S. dollars.
The company issued comments to a local newspaper confirming the attack, however, technical
details were not disclosed by the company.

Twitter Post from Light SA Official Account, Confirming the Attack
Our malware analysis team had access to the binary that was likely used in the attack and we
were able to confirm that the sample is from a family known as Sodinokibi (aka REvil). Althought
we can't confirm that this was the exact same file used in the attack, the evidence points to being
connected to the Light SA breach, such as the ransom price, for example. The sample was
automatically collected by AppGate Labs on June 17, 2020 through our live hunting process, and
as the binary was sent to a public sandbox, this suggests someone from the company submitted
that file attempting to understand how it works.

Machine Infected with Sodinokibi Sample.
The sample is packed and works the same as other binaries that we have already identified from
this family, and once unpacked, we were able to decrypt its configuration and access relevant data
about the threat, such as the actor / campaign ID, and the URL in which the victim must access to
get instructions.

Ransomware Attack Asking 14,000,000 USD.
According to the page that is hosted in the deep web, the ransom amount must be paid using the

virtual currency Monero, and prior to June 19, the total was 106,870.19 XMR, which is equivalent
to 7 million USD. However, since the deadline has passed, the price has doubled to 14 million US
dollars. The whole attack looks very professional, the web page even includes a chat support,
where the victim can speak directly with the attacker. Sodinokibi works as a RaaS (Ransomware
as a Service) model, and the group behind the operation seems to be affiliated to "Pinchy Spider",
which is the same group behind GandCrab ransomware[1].

With the URL collected from the binary, we were able to access the webpage (hosted on deep
web) and confirm details about the attack. First thing of notice is the ransom price, which is
extremely high and likely due to the affected company belonging to an important sector.

There is an ‘About Us’ which contains a small overview about the Sodinokibi family.

Sodinokibi Description According to the Web Page.
Also, it provides an online chat support, where the victim can interact with the attackers. In the
images below, we can see that someone reached out to the attacker. We decided to censor the
images to reduce the exposure of the person involved.

Sodinokibi Chat Support.

At the end of the chat we can see that the attacker sends a file that is supposedly confidential,
proving to the victim that the data can be decrypted and also suggesting that file was probably
stolen from the company's network.

Decrypted “_Confidencial.xlsx” File Sent by Attacker.
Technical Details

The main file is packed and it uses two shellcodes streams for unpacking and execution process.
First, it allocates a memory space using “LocalAlloc[2]” API, writes an encrypted shellcode to it,
and transfers execution once decrypted.

This shellcode unpacks Sodinokibi along with a second shellcode, which will eventually load the
final binary to memory.

Finally, the shellcode injects the unpacked Sodinokibi binary into the same process space, by
wiping the original PE file from memory and writing the new PE.

The binary is highly configurable, the setting is encrypted with RC4 and it’s usually stored in a
randomly named section, and in this case the section name is “.cfg”.

Upon execution, it will decrypt the content of this section into an allocated memory space.

If true, wipes the folders specified in “wfld”

An interesting capability not utilized by this specific sample is if “exp” is “true”, it tries to escalate
privileges by exploiting a vulnerability in “win32k.sys” (CVE-2018-8453[3]) with both 32-bit and 64bit versions of the exploit, using a technique known as “Heaven’s Gate[4]” to execute 64 bit code
in a 32 bit process, located in the “.rdata” section of the PE file.

Also, if the “dbg” option is set to “false”, the malware will check the UI language and the keyboard
layout of the infected machine.

Keyboard Layout Verification.
Above, we can see that this Ransomware has a whitelist based on location, if the return value[5]
matches any value of the list, it will not encrypt files in the machine.
Furthermore, it uses PowerShell to delete Windows shadow copies.

Once encrypting all the files, it changes the background with the following image:

Lastly, it appends a ransom note to every folder where encrypted files can be found.

Sodinokibi Ransom Note.
Unfortunately, there is no global decryptor for the family, which means that the attacker's private
key is required to decrypt the files.
During the period of the attack, we noticed that the company’s website was offline, presenting an
error message related to the database, which could be related to the attack.
