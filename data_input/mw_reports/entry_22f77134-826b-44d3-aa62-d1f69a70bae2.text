EMERGING THREATS
WHISPERGATE MALWARE - UPDATE

Cyborg Security has published additional hunt packages, as well as updated a
hunt package already available in the Hunter platform, as a result of additional
analysis and research of the WhisperGate attack. These new packages work to
identify techniques employed by WhisperGate specifically, as well as broader
techniques employed by multiple malware variants. Each of the packages help to
identify a portion of the attack chain observed by the stage 2 and stage 3 binaries
utilized in the WhisperGate attack against the Ukrainian government in January
2022. Multiple packages were developed around general techniques, with the
intent to identify future attacks by the same group or malware, even if revisions
are made, as well as other malwares employing techniques in similar ways.

Threat Summary
The WhisperGate malware variant was first identified by the MSTIC (Microsoft Threat
Intelligence center) on January 13, 2022 and has attributed to the nation-state threat
group given the name \"DEV-0586\" (temporary name given by MS until origin/identity
is received).
This threat group has been observed conducting operations on Ukrainian government
and organizations, during the geopolitical tensions between Ukraine and Russia.
Specific Intent and targets was not identified in the MSTIC article but due to the
political climate, systems within or associated to Ukraine should be prepared
accordingly - as of today, there has been dozens of impacted systems identified and
potentially growing that fall under that umbrella.
The variant has been observed as a Wiper, disguised as ransomware - similar to the
NotPetya attack in 2017. Seen in both variants, a ransom demand is displayed upon boot
but is deceptive, as the malware wipes data files rather than encrypting them like
typical ransomware does. The intent is destruction rather than using the data as
leverage. Although currently targeting Ukraine, the potentiality of this malware or a
modified version of it or its techniques being utilized by another threat group is
possible.

Synopsis
The WhisperGate malware variant was discovered targeting Ukraine government and
organizations in early January by the MSTIC, and identified as a form of Wiper malware that is
masquerading as ransomware. With that being said, although the variant is designed to be
ransomware, there is no intention of allowing the recovery of the data that is affected. This
reveals that the intent of the actor is seeking damage, rather than leverage with infections.
The malware has been observed to have two stages, the first is the overwriting of the Master
Boot Records - this is where the fake ransom note is revealed as well to the victim. Due to the
Master Boot Record being corrupted/overwritten, the recovery of the system if the user decides
to potentially reboot or shutdown/startup. The MSTIC report mentions that the ransom note is
unusual in the way it is crafted as well, with the irregularities including the same explicit
payment amounts and wallet addresses being specified for each note and the absence of a
custom ID that a victim is usually told to reference in communications.
The second stage that has been observed is the execution of a downloader (identified as
Stage2.exe), that pulls the next stage malware and executes in memory. The malware then
sprawls and corrupts files in specified directories on the system with specific file extensions (the
specific extensions can be found in the MSTIC report). The corruption entails the overwriting of
the contents of the file and renaming them with a random extension.
Further information regarding WhisperGate, as well as the extensions mentioned and IOCs
identified can be found at the original MSTIC article at:

AdvancedRun/InstallUtil Utilities Executed From Unusual Directory
As part of stage3 and stage4 of the WhisperGate malware attack, the WhisperGate malware dropped
AdvancedRun.exe to the host's temp directory, and copied InstallUtil.exe from it's default location to
AppData\Local\Temp. In the case of InstallUtil.exe, the malware utilized this for process hallowing to have
a legitimate appearing binary running malicious code injected by WhisperGate. The AdvancedRun.exe
utility was utilized by WhisperGate to further impair Windows Defender beyond the path exclusions
added by a VBS file.

Microsoft Defender Overly Broad Exclusion Change via PowerShell - Potential Malware
Infection
Microsoft Windows Defender can be modified via PowerShell Set-MpPrefernce function. This allows
setting exclusions for folders, processes, extensions, IPs as well as other configuration changes. Although a
package already available in Hunter could identify when the Set-MpPreference was utilized
(https://hunter.cyborgsecurity.io/details/use-case/aa6e2535-e1e3-4f0f-80e4-68cc47fc2684), this package
focuses more on the specific folders being added as exclusions. The logic was developed based on
research performed by Cyborg Security analysts, revealing several commands performed by PowerShell to
inhibit Windows Defender's abilities to protect the compromised host. In the WhisperGate attack, the C:\
"folder" (root drive) was added as an excluded path. Cyborg Security analysts took this a step further and
added other commonly abused folders by malware, which may be attempted in future attacks to exclude
from monitoring or protection.

VBS File Written to AppData\Local\Temp Directory - Potential Defense Evasion
Analysis and research revealed the stage3 binary associated with the WhisperGate malware attack on the
Ukrainian government, the use of a VBS file dropped into the host's temp directory. This VBS file, located
in AppData\Local\Temp, was utilized to run PowerShell commands to impair Windows Defender.

the Windows Defender directory (C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows Defender) via PowerShell script
block logging.
