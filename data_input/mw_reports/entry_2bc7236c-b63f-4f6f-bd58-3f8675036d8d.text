This blogpost aims at contextualising and analysing trends pertaining to cyber malicious activities associated to the Democratic
People’s Republic of Korea-nexus Intrusion Sets reported in open sources in 2022.
TLDR;
• All known Intrusion Sets associated to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) were reported being active over
the year, Lazarus and Kimsuky activities being the most reported on.
• Kimsuky, Bluenoroff, and Lazarus mandates continue to overlap, and Lazarus, Bluenoroff and Andariel keep on conducting
dual objectives operations pertaining to revenue generation (AppleJeus, SnatchCrypto) and cyberespionage (DreamJob), in
line with Pyongyang strategic interests.
• DPRK associated Intrusion Sets continued demonstrating efforts to update their TTPs and expand their toolset (Lazarus’use
of the BYOVD technique and Kimsuky’s Sharpext malware) further contributing to these groups’ stealthiness and goals
achievement.
• SEKOIA.IO analysts assess cyber malicious campaigns orchestrated by Pyongyang will almost certainly continue in the shortterm.

Associated with the development of a ballistic, nuclear, and bacteriological arsenal, the cybernetic component, called “secret
war” by Pyongyang, is part of the North Korean offensive approach since at least 2004. DPRK offensive cyber activities include
cyberespionage and lucrative campaigns and are resolutely asymmetrical and a force multiplier in subverting international
sanctions and funding Pyongyang’s economy. These facets contribute to the survival of the North Korean state, as well as
maintaining its position within the international system as a “small great power.”
DPRK malicious cyber activities involve multiple state organisations, including the Ministry of State Security (MSS aka Bowibu)
and the Reconnaissance General Bureau. Associated Intrusion Sets include Lazarus, Bluenoroff, Andariel, Reaper, and
Kimsuky.

A saucerful of Secrets
Let there be more spy
All North-Korea-associated Intrusion Sets continued carrying out cyberespionage activities throughout the year, with a
particularly high tempo of activity demonstrated by Lazarus and Kimsuky. Targeted sectors notably included a strong focus
on cryptocurrency-related entities and the aerospace and defence industry (operation DreamJob). Additional sectors of
interest include technology, civil society (journalists, activists, defectors), academia, think tanks, media, and diplomacy, notably
pertaining to nuclear policy, Korean Peninsula and Asia-Pacific subject matters. Reported malicious activities suggest a
renewed interest in targeting international organisations [1] [2] for strategic intelligence collection.
SEKOIA.IO analysts noticed Kimsuky refocusing on their traditional assigned locations,
namely the United States (U.S.), Japan, and the Republic of Korea (aka RoK and South Korea),
and refocusing on military intelligence collection, as well as expanding their victimology
to target the shipping industry [3] and a company involved in carbon credits [4].
Last reported in April 2022, DPRK-nexus Intrusion Set Reaper was seen carrying out targeted surveillance operations
against human rights activists, journalists, and defectors from
North Korea notably leveraging the Chinotto malware [5], Goldbackdoor, a variant of the BlueLight malware [6], and newly
discovered CloudMensis, a spyware based on RokRAT and designed to target Windows and MacOS systems [7].
Additional DPRK-aligned cyberespionage activities include the targeting of the energy and
military sectors [8], as well as energy providers in Canada, Japan, and the United States
between February and July 2022 [9]. Of note, energy-related targeting is a consistent longstanding assignment for the Andariel
Intrusion Set. Additionally, Andariel was reported deploying their signature Maui ransomware on at least one occasion in 2022
[10]. Based on available information, it is not clear whether the deployment of Maui was part of a lucrative objective and / or an
anti-forensic effort from the Intrusion Set. It is also plausible ransomware operations carried out by Andariel are part of
moonlighting activities for personal gain or selffunding.
You get a good (Dream)job
2022 saw the continuation of DreamJob (aka ShowState, DeathNote, Operation In(ter)ception),
a two-fold campaign run by Lazarus since March 2019. DreamJob encompasses the targeting
of aerospace and defence related organisations and individuals, security researchers, and
cryptocurrency related entities for cyberespionage and lucrative objectives.
2/8

Lazarus continued relying on social engineering, including leveraging social networks and
messaging applications (notably LinkedIn, WhatsApp and Slack) masquerading as recruiters
from defence [11] and cryptocurrency high profile companies. Recent victimology notably includes defence contractors in
France, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Germany, Czech Republic, the
Netherlands, Poland, Ukraine, Turkey, South Africa, Qatar, and Brazil [12].
SEKOIA.IO analysts assess the targeting of security researchers observed in this campaign
likely provides Lazarus with knowledge to improve their Tactics, Techniques and Procedures
(TTPs), notably those pertaining to persistence, defence evasion and anti-forensics efforts.
This activity also possibly aims at contributing to capacity building for Lazarus, providing
them with new tools and malware for follow-up operations.

The DPRK side of the mo(o)ney
DPRK-nexus Intrusion Sets, including Lazarus and Bluenoroff continued carrying out lucrative cyber campaigns, notably
targeting cryptocurrency and financial technology-related activities. As previously mentioned, this includes part of Operation
DreamJob conducted by Lazarus, whose financially motivated aspect was notably illustrated by the targeting of a Brazilian
cryptocurrency company with NukeSped [13]. Of note, SEKOIA.IO assess it is likely that Brazil “Bitcoin Law” debates occurring
in October 2021 [14] renewed Lazarus’ interest in targeting this country in lucrative motivated campaigns.

Apples and Oranges
Lazarus also continued running the AppleJeus campaign, targeting cryptocurrency and fintech platforms and users with
backdoored cryptocurrency trading applications, active since at least 2018 [15]. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency (CISA) publicly attributed the malicious campaign against decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Ronin Network
(Axie Infinity) that occurred in March to Lazarus [16].

Snatch that cash
Another long-running campaign called SnatchCrypto (aka CryptoCore, DangerousPassword)
carried out by Bluenoroff since 2017 was still active through 2022 [17]. From SEKOIA.IO analysts’ vantage point, this
campaign notably includes TraderTraitor activities, a series of malicious applications masquerading as trading or price
prediction tools, using the Electron framework and cross-platform JavaScript code to deliver the Manuscrypt RAT [18]. This
campaign appears opportunistic in nature, victimology notably includes Europe, Asia, the U.S., and the UAE.
Financially motivated campaigns are a trademark of DPRK-nexus Intrusion Sets, almost certainly to evade economic sanctions
and funding of follow-up cyber malicious campaigns. Open-source reports also indicate funding of nuclear weapons through the
Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), specifically Bureau 121, which Lazarus, Andariel and Bluenoroff are allegedly
subordinated to. However, recent reporting indicates that DPRK-nexus Intrusion Sets tend to hold stolen cryptocurrency for
several years, possibly as part of their monetary policy. Another hypothesis is that unlaundered cryptocurrency funds could
possibly result from an operator error.

The Peek at the gates
Based on reported TTPs and malware analysis provided in open sources, SEKOIA.IO analysts observed North Korea-nexus
Intrusion Sets strong and continued efforts in selectively targeting their victims and improving their stealthiness.
Besides advanced reconnaissance efforts, Intrusion Sets can further screen their targets before delivering their payload. For
instance, Kimsuky was recently observed using an IP validation method as part of its GoldDragon infection mechanism [19].
The same Intrusion Set also newly implemented a geofencing mechanism in their signature malware Konni RAT [20], and
similar behaviour was observed in the FastSpy infection chain [21]. In a recent campaign Kimsuky also used a file exfiltrator
component to find and collect specific files of interest via filelists hosted on a remote server [22].

4/8

While North Korea-nexus Intrusion Sets traditionally reuse their infrastructure, they demonstrate increased efforts to achieve
stealthiness, notably through obfuscation, defence evasion mechanisms as well as regularly updating their infection chain. Of
note, spearphishing remains the principal observed vector of intrusion in these Intrusion Sets malicious cyber activities.
In a campaign against South Korean diplomacy and security-related entities, Kimsuky impersonated a South Korean institution
to engage in an email exchange, sending a malicious URL only if the recipient responds positively to the initial email. Similarly,
Lazarus was observed hosting a ZIP file containing a malicious document to bypass recent changes made by Microsoft for
Office macros [23] . Also increasingly reported is the hosting of malicious Command and Control (C2) on open-source
hosting services such as DropBox, GitHub or Blogspot.
Of particular interest and documented as a first seen in the wild in 2022 (although leveraged at least since October 2021 as
part of Operation DreamJob), Lazarus’ Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) technique to deploy BLINDINGCAN [24].
Lazarus was also observed leveraging CVE-2022-0609, a 0-day remote code execution vulnerability in Google Chrome web
browser to target cryptocurrency and fintech entities through spearphishing, fake websites, or compromised legitimate
websites.
These TTPs are a sign of adaptability by North Korea-nexus Intrusion Sets, and SEKOIA.IO analysts assess this is almost
certainly a way to preserve their offensive capabilities.

Household objects
Over the course of this year, North Korea-nexus Intrusion Sets continuously dedicated efforts to update and / or renew their
toolsets. Notable changes to SEKOIA.IO analysts include:
Lazarus recent development of KiTTY, a weaponized PuTTY fork, as part of its BLINDINGCAN infection chain [25].
MagicRAT, a new C++ malware delivered after exploitation of publicly exposed VMware Horizon platforms [26].
As touched upon before, Kimsuky was observed leveraging new Android malware known as FastFire, FastViewer, and
FastSpy. Another interesting malicious web browser extension used by Kimsuky is Sharpext, used by Kimsuky a postexploitation tool since 2021 [27].

Is there anybody out there?
Us and them
In 2022, open-source reports mentioned overlaps between DPRK Intrusion Sets and cybercriminal groups, including:
Suspected links between Lazarus and Wizard Spider
Based on infrastructure links, security researchers initially assessed a potential connection between Russia-based
cybercriminal group Wizard Spider and Lazarus [28]. Based on the report documenting the Exotic Lily Initial Access Broker
(IAB), SEKOIA.IO assess it is likely that Lazarus resorted to IAB services, including Exotic Lily’s, and entertain connections
with the cybercriminal ecosystem.
5/8

Connections between Quantum Builder and Lazarus
A report published in open sources in June 2022 mentioned a possible use of the .lnk builder Quantum Software / Quantum
Builder by Lazarus [29]. Upon script comparison, it was observed the PowerShell script deobfuscation loop and initialization of
variables were similar. As Lazarus increasingly resorted to .lnk since the second half of 2020, SEKOIA analysts assess it is
plausible they use Quantum Builder as part of their toolset.
Connections between DEV-0530 and Andariel
Tracked under the DEV-0530 alias, the cybercriminal group which developed the H0lyGh0st ransomware is assessed to be
originating from the DPRK [30]. Microsoft security researchers assess that DEV-0530 “has connections” with Andariel. This
assessment is notably based on the observation of communication between DEV-0530 email accounts and Andariel accounts,
infrastructure links, as well as DEV0530’s use of tools exclusively used by Andariel. SEKOIA.IO analysts concur with Microsoft
hypothesis of moonlighting activities. It is likely that DEV-0530 is an offshoot of Andariel.

Wish you were here
In 2022, the DPRK cyber offensive strategy continued relying on the physical layer.

In April 2022, two South Korean individuals, the CEO of a virtual asset investment company and an active-duty officer, were
charged with violating the South Korea National Security Act for leaking military information to a suspected North Korean agent
[32]. The operation reportedly involved a camera watch and a PoisonTap USB device [33] to infiltrate a South Korean military
base and gain access to a military laptop between January and March 2022.
In May 2022, the U.S. Department of State issued an advisory, alerting organisations against hiring North Korean IT workers
[34].
This highlights that North Korean intelligence operatives continue leveraging individuals, including insider threats, that will
notably assist in obtaining access to systems of interest. SEKOIA.IO assess that part of stolen cryptocurrency plausibly
contributes to fund incentives for such operations. Furthermore, it is also possible that North Korean IT workers abroad could
leverage the acquired skills to carry out malicious campaigns in line with Pyongyang interests.

The Sanction bell
In 2022, DPRK-associated cyber malicious activities garnered increased attention, in a context of heightened tensions in
the Korean Peninsula.
In January, North Korea’s Internet was hit by two waves of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks [35] which turned out to
be a hackback carried out by a hacker in retaliation to Lazarus DreamJob campaign [36].
In addition, Nation-State political and economic measures were undertaken. SEKOIA.IO analysts notably observed a more
coordinated, time-constrained approach to the attribution process and efforts to hinder malicious cyber activities. U.S. agencies
officially attributed the TraderTraitor campaign to Bluenoroff, the Maui ransomware to Andariel [37], and the Ronin Network
cryptocurrency theft to Lazarus.
In March 2022, the U.S. Department of Treasury sanctioned Blender.io, a virtual currency mixer, used by Lazarus to launder
USD 20.5 million (out of the USD 620 million stolen) on the account of financially supporting DPRK [38]. In August 2022, the
U.S. also blacklisted Tornado Cash, a virtual currency mixer used by Lazarus to launder at least USD 7 billion worth of virtual

6/8

currency since its creation in 2019 [39]. This was followed by the arrest of a Tornado Cash developer in the Netherlands by the
Fiscal Information and Investigation Service (FIOD) [40].

Assessements
Based on DPRK-nexus Intrusion Sets reported activities, SEKOIA.IO analysts assess the following:
It is almost certain financially motivated cyber campaigns will remain a high priority for Pyongyang. DPRK-nexus
Intrusion Sets lucrative activities will continue in the short-to-medium term, with a consistent targeting of cryptocurrency
and fintech related entities and individuals. It is likely Lazarus and Bluenoroff will expand their victimology to include
countries inclined to legalise cryptocurrency and / or where cryptocurrency is a legal tender (i.e., Ecuador, Central
Africa, Salvador).
It is almost certain that military intelligence, strategic intelligence, and economic intelligence collection and surveillance
will remain strong drivers for DPRK-originating cyberespionage campaigns. This notably includes continuation of the longrunning campaign DreamJob.
While ongoing sanction measures are likely to slow down DPRK Intrusion Sets activities in the short-term, SEKOIA.IO
analysts assess this is unlikely to disrupt cyber malicious campaigns orchestrated by Pyongyang.
SEKOIA.IO will continue monitoring and tracking Intrusion Sets associated to DPRK and welcome any feedback and / or
additional input to further contribute to understanding and countering this threat.
