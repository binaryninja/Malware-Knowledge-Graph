Alert Number

I-112320-PSA
Questions regarding this PSA should be directed to your local FBI Field Office.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is issuing this announcement to help the public
recognize and avoid spoofed FBI-related Internet domains. The FBI observed unattributed
cyber actors registering numerous domains spoofing legitimate FBI websites, indicating the
potential for future operational activity. The FBI's main official website is www.fbi.gov. (See
appendix for a list of identified spoofed FBI-related Internet domains.)
Spoofed domains and email accounts are leveraged by foreign actors and cybercriminals
and can easily be mistaken for legitimate websites or emails. Adversaries can use spoofed
domains and email accounts to disseminate false information; gather valid usernames,
passwords, and email addresses; collect personally identifiable information; and spread
malware, leading to further compromises and potential financial losses
Cyber actors create spoofed domains with slightly altered characteristics of legitimate
domains. A spoofed domain may feature an alternate spelling of a word, or use an
alternative top-level domain, such as a "[.]com" version of a legitimate "[.]gov" website.
Members of the public could unknowingly visit spoofed domains while seeking information
regarding the FBI's mission, services, or news coverage. Additionally, cyber actors may use
seemingly legitimate email accounts to entice the public into clicking on malicious files or
links.
The FBI urges all members of the American public to critically evaluate the websites they
visit, and the messages sent to their personal and business email accounts, to seek out
reliable and verified FBI information.

Recommendations

1/3

Verify the spelling of web addresses, websites, and email addresses that look
trustworthy but may be imitations of legitimate election websites.
Ensure operating systems and applications are updated to the most current versions.
Update anti-malware and anti-virus software and conduct regular network scans.
Do not enable macros on documents downloaded from an email unless absolutely
necessary, and after ensuring the file is not malicious.
Do not open emails or attachments from unknown individuals. Do not communicate
with unsolicited email senders.
Never provide personal information of any sort via email. Be aware that many emails
requesting your personal information may appear to be legitimate.
Use strong two-factor authentication if possible, using biometrics, hardware tokens, or
authentication apps.
Use domain whitelisting to allow outgoing network traffic to websites that are deemed
safe.
Disable or remove unneeded software applications
Verify that the website you visit has a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate.

Victim Reporting and Additional Information
The FBI encourages the public to report information concerning suspicious or criminal
activity to their local field office (www.fbi.gov/contact-us/fieldoffices) or the FBI's Internet
Crime Complaint Center (www.ic3.gov).
