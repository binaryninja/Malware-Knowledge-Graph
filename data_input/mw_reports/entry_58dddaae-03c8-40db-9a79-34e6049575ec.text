Metamorfo Banking Trojan Keeps Its Sights on Brazil
blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/11/metamorfo-brazilian-campaigns.html

Executive Summary
Financially motivated cybercriminals have used banking trojans for years to steal sensitive
financial information from victims. They are often created to gather credit card information
and login credentials for various online banking and financial services websites so this data
can be monetized by the attackers. Cisco Talos recently identified two ongoing malware
distribution campaigns being used to infect victims with banking trojans, specifically financial
institutions' customers in Brazil. Additionally, during the analysis of these campaigns, Talos
identified a dedicated spam botnet that is currently delivering malicious spam emails as part
of the infection process.

Distribution campaigns
While analyzing these campaigns, Talos identified two separate infection processes that we
believe attackers have used between late October and early November. These campaigns
used different file types for the initial download and infection process, and ultimately
delivered two separate banking trojans that target Brazilian financial institutions. Both
campaigns used the same naming convention for various files used during the infection
process and featured the abuse of link-shortening services to obscure the actual distribution
1/15

servers used. The use of link shorteners also allows some additional flexibility. Many
organizations allow their employees to access link shorteners from corporate environments,
which could enable the attacker to shift where they are hosting malicious files, while also
enabling them to leverage these legitimate services in email-based campaigns.

Campaign 1
Talos identified a spam campaign using a zipped file hosted on a free web hosting platform.
This archive contains a Windows LNK file (Link). During this campaign, the filename followed
the following format:
"Fatura-XXXXXXXXXX.zip," where "XXXXXXXXXX" is a 10-digit numeric value.
The LNK file format was:
"__Fatura pendente - XXXX.lnk," where "XXXX" is a four-digit alphanumeric value.
The purpose of the LNK file was to download a PowerShell script with an image filename
extension (.bmp or .png):

The purpose of this command is to download and execute a PowerShell script from the
attacker's URL. This new PowerShell script is also obfuscated:

This script is used to download an archive hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS):
hXXps://s3-eu-west-1[.]amazonaws[.]com/killino2/image2.png.
This archive contains two files:
A dynamic library (.DLL)
A compressed payload (.PRX)

The library decompresses the PRX file and executes it in a remote process (library injection).
This injected code is the final payload described later in this post.

Campaign 2
In addition to the infection process described in Campaign 1, Talos also observed a second
series of campaigns that leveraged a different process to deliver and execute malware on
victim systems. This campaign also appeared to target Portuguese-speaking victims.

3/15

In this series of campaigns, attackers leveraged malicious PE32 executables to perform the
initial stage of the infection process rather than Windows shortcut files (LNK). These PE32
executables were delivered in ZIP archives using the following naming convention:
"Fatura-XXXXXXXXXX.zip," where "XXXXXXXXXX'" is a 10-digit numeric value.
A PE32 executable is inside of the ZIP archive. These executables used the following
naming convention:
"__Fatura pendente - XXXX.exe," where "XXXX" is a four-digit alphanumeric value.
When executed, these PE32 files are used to create a batch file in a subdirectory of
%TEMP%.
The Windows Command Processor is then used to execute the batch file which, in turn,
executes PowerShell with the instructions to download the contents hosted on the attackercontrolled server and pass it to the Invoke-Expression (IEX) using the following syntax:

The batch file is then deleted and the infection process continues.

4/15

When the system reaches out to Bitly, the link shortener, to access the contents hosted at
the shortened link destination, an HTTP redirection redirects the client to the attackercontrolled server hosting a PowerShell script that is passed into IEX and executed as
previously described. The server delivers the following PowerShell:

This PowerShell script retrieves and executesthe malicious payload that is being delivered to
the system. This PowerShell also leverages the Bitly service, as seen in the previous
screenshot.
With Bitly links, users can obtain some further information by adding the "+" sign to the end
of the shortened URL. By doing this, we discovered that the link was created on Oct. 21,
most likely around the campaign start time, and the number of clicks that have been
registered through the Bitly service, we identified 699 clicks so far.

While the HTTP request is made for a JPEG and the content type specified is "image/jpeg,"
the server actually delivers a ZIP archive containing a Windows DLL file called "b.dll."

5/15

The script then executes sleep mode for 10 seconds after which it extracts the archive and
saves the DLL to a subdirectory of %APPDATA% on the system. RunDLL32 is then used to
execute the malware, infecting the system. The uncompressed DLL is very large,
approximately 366MB in size, due to the inclusion of a large number of 0x00 within the
binary. This may have been used to evade automated detection and analysis systems, as
many will not properly process large files. Similarly, this will avoid sandbox detonation, as
most sandboxes will not allow files of this size.
Additionally, infected systems beacon to an attacker-controlled server (srv99[.]tk) during the
infection process.

Analysis of the DNS communications associated with this domain shows an increase in
attempts to resolve this domain, which corresponds with the campaigns that have been
observed.

6/15

The majority of these resolution requests have occurred from systems located in Brazil.

The PowerShell execution also facilitates communications with a dynamic DNS service.
Similarly to the first Bitly link, we were able to obtain additional information in relation to this
domain:

We once again see a creation time, but this time, it's a few days later. This potentially shows
the actor pivoting to a different email list to send the same spam information to.

Spam tools
Both of these campaigns eventually deliver a banking trojan. However, Talos identified
additional tools and malware hosted on the Amazon S3 Bucket. This malware is a remote
7/15

administration tool with the capability to create emails. The emails are created on the BOL
Online email platform, an internet portal that provides email hosting and free email services
in Brazil. The attacker's main goal appears to be creating a botnet of systems dedicated to
email creation.
The malware is developed in C# and contains many Portuguese words.
Here is the function used to create a BOL email:

Once created, the randomly generated username and password are sent to a C2 server.
BOL Online uses a CAPTCHA system to keep machines from creating emails. To bypass
this protection, the malware author uses the Recaptcha API with the token provided from the
C2 server:

8/15

During our investigation, all the created emails were prefixed by "financeir."
The trojan has the capability to clean itself, send created email credentials and restart,
download and execute binaries provided by the C2 server.
Talos identified three C2 servers:
hxxp://criadoruol[.]site/
hxxp://jdm-tuning[.]ru/
hxxp://www[.]500csgo[.]ru/
We identified more than 700 compromised systems on the servers that are members of his
botnet. The oldest machine was compromised on Oct. 23. This botnet created more than
4,000 unique emails on the BOL Online service using the the aforementioned technique.
Some of these emails were used to initiate the spam campaigns we tracked as part of this
research.
Given the filename patterns, the victimology along with the specific targeting aspect of both
campaigns, Talos assesses with moderate confidence that both of these campaigns
leveraged the same email generation tool we discovered on the actors open S3 Bucket. This
shows a link between both campaigns to the same actor using the same toolset. Likely the
actor attempted to use different delivery methods and email lists to deliver his malspam.

Final payload
We identified two different payloads deployed during these campaigns. The payloads are
developed in Delphi and are banking trojans targeting Brazilian banks.
9/15

Fellow security firm FireEye already covered the first payload here. It gets information on the
compromised system and exfiltrates the data to a C2 server. It also includes a keylogger,
which is exactly the same as the keylogger we described in this post. When the user is
logged into their bank's website, the malware can interact with them by showing a fake
popup alleging to be from the bank. Here is an example that attempts to steal the user's
CVV:

The second one has exactly the same features but is implemented differently. It mainly
targets two=factor authentication by displaying fake popups to the user:

10/15

A keylogger then retrieves the information entered by the target.
The following financial services organizations are being targeted by this malware: Santander,
Itaù, Banco do Brasil, Caixa, Sicredi, Bradesco, Safra, Sicoob, Banco da Amazonia, Banco
do Nordeste, Banestes, Banrisul, Banco de Brasilia and Citi.

Conclusion
This strain of malware is prevalent throughout the world and is further proof that banking
trojans remain popular. With this sample the attacker targets specific Brazilian banking
institutions. This could suggest the attacker is from South America, where they could find it
easier to use the obtained details and credentials to carry out illicit financial activities. We will
continue to monitor financial crimeware activities throughout the threat landscape. This is not
a sophisticated trojan, and most banking malware rarely is, but it's the latest example of how
easy it can be for criminals steal from users by abusing spam to send their malicious
payloads.This threat also shows the lengths that actors are going to in order to obtain
additional emails to abuse, creating an automatic generation mechanism to get new emails
for additional spam campaigns.
