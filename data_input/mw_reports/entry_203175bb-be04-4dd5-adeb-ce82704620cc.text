A Deep-dive Analysis of LOCKBIT 2.0

August 16, 2021

The LOCKBIT 2.0 ransomware group has been highly active in the past few months. The Threat Actors
(TAs) linked to this ransomware use a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) business model. LOCKBIT
2.0 developers customize ransomware variants as per their affiliates’ needs. They also offer various panels and
attack statistics to provide victim management capabilities to their affiliates.
The malware uses the double extortion technique to compel victims into paying ransoms. Through this technique,
attackers exfiltrate the victim’s data, after which they proceed to encrypt the data on the victim’s system. Data
encryption is followed by the TAs demand ransom in exchange for a decryptor. If the victim refuses or cannot pay
the ransom, the TA threatens to leak the data. This ransomware was previously known as ABCD ransomware as
the file extension used for encrypting files was .abcd. Now the extension used by this ransomware is .lockbit.
Figure 1 shows the LOCKBIT 2.0 ransomware gang hosting a blog in the TOR network. This
blog, in particular, is used by the TA to share the list of victims and screenshots of the sample data exfiltrated by
the attackers from affected systems.

Like other recently emerging RaaS gangs, LOCKBIT 2.0 also has an affiliate program to attract
potential affiliates. Figure 2 shows the affiliate program page.

LockBit is trying to position itself as the fastest encryptor compared to its competitor, RaaS gangs. They have
listed the time spent on encryption for datasets of 100GB, 10TB, etc. Figure 3 shows the comparison of LOCKBIT
2.0 with other ransomware gangs.

Additionally, this ransomware gang does not function in countries formerly a part of the Soviet Union. This gang
also uses tools such as StealBIT, Metasploit Framework, and Cobalt Strike.

StealBIT is an information stealer used by the gang for data exfiltration. Metasploit Framework and Cobalt Strike
are penetration testing tools used to emulate targeted attacks on sophisticated networks.

Technical Analysis
Our static analysis of the ransomware shows that the malware file is a Windows x86
architecture Graphical User Interface (GUI) executable compiled on 2021-07-26 13:04:01, as shown in Figure 5.

Cyble Research Labs has also found that the malware uses only a few libraries, shown in Figure 6.

Ransomware
Furthermore, only a few Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) were present in the ransomware import
table, as shown in Figure 7.

Figure 8 shows that the ransomware has encrypted user document files and appended them with
a .lockbit extension while also changing the icon of all encrypted files. Additionally, the ransomware also drops
a ransom note in several folders.

Figure 9 shows the content of the ransom note, which instructs the victims on how they can contact
the ransomware gang.

The ransomware also changes the desktop background, showing additional ransomware gang information, as
shown below.

To get further insights into the ransomware, we checked which string symbols were present in the malware.
Figure 11 shows the details of the initial strings which are present in the malware. These strings indicate that the
malware can query connected systems in the Active Directory
Domain using the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). In query strings, CN stands for Common
Name, OU stands for Organization Unit, and DC stands for Domain Component. This information could be used
for discovering other linked networks and systems.
Figure 11: Setting LDAP parameters for
Microsoft Active Directory
As seen in Figure 12, the ransomware could use PowerShell commands to query the DC to get the list
of computers. Once the list is received, malware could invoke the GPUpdate command remotely on the listed
systems.

Additionally, the ransomware checks for additional mounted hard drives, network shared drives, shared folders of
VMs, and deletes the running process using taskkill.exe shown in Figure 12.
Figure 13 depicts the policy updates that ransomware can push in the active directory environment to other
connected systems. To evade detection, the ransomware can disable Windows Defender on running systems and
remote systems as well.

Defender Policies are changed by the ransomware
While running the ransomware, we observed that it injects itself in dllhost.exe, as shown in Figure 14.

The ransomware adds its execution folder to the Path of the System variables, as shown in Figure 15.

Figure 16 shows the ransomware looking for various running services like backup services, database-related
applications, and other applications shown in Figure 15. If any service is found running in the system,
the ransomware kills it. The ransomware uses OpenSCManager and OpenServiceA, as shown in Figure 16.

The ransomware creates a shared folder for VMWare to spread to other systems, as shown in Figure 17.

The encryption operation of the LOCKBIT 2.0 is similar to what we have observed in other ransomware
groups. The flow of operation is shown below.

Conclusion
LOCKBIT 2.0 is a highly sophisticated form of ransomware that uses various state-of-the-art techniques to
perform ransomware operations. Current and potential LOCKBIT 2.0 victims’ range across multiple domains, from
IT, services to banks. Our research indicates that affiliates of the group drop this ransomware inside an already

compromised network.
