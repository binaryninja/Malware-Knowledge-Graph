fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/ransomware-roundup-play-ransomware
December 22, 2022

On a bi-weekly basis, FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that
have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware
Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware
landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants.
This latest edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the Play ransomware.
Affected platforms: Microsoft Windows
Impacted parties: Microsoft Windows Users
Impact: Encrypts files on the compromised machine and demands ransom for file decryption
Severity level: High

Play Ransomware Overview
1/7

Play is a relative newcomer to the ransomware game, having been detected for the first time
in June 2022. In this report, Play refers to both the group developing and distributing it and
the name of the ransomware executable. Like many other operators in this space, Play has
adopted the double-extortion methodology of encrypting endpoints and/or other infrastructure
of value within an organization and then threatening to release exfiltrated data from those
machines on the internet if a ransom is not paid.

Play Ransomware Infection Vector
Play has been seen to use a number of common methods to gain access to an environment,
including phishing, valid compromised accounts, and exposed RDP (Remote Desktop
Protocol) servers. Once a beachhead has been established, LOLBINS (Living Off the Land
Binaries) are used to explore and then prepare the ground to execute malware on machines
of interest.

Play Ransomware Executable
The ransomware executable is Microsoft Visual C++ based and contains several antidebugging and anti-analysis features to slow investigations into the activity of the malware.
These features include garbage code (untethered instructions that serve no useful purpose)
and function returns that drive execution into a dead end.
Figure 1. Garbage code in the Play executable.

Play Ransomware Execution
When launched, the ransomware encrypts all files of interest, such as personal and
operational documents (it does not touch system files), and leaves them with a “.PLAY”
extension.
Figure 2. Files encrypted by Play.
When encryption is complete, a ransom note named “ReadMe.txt” is added to the root of the
primary drive (e.g., C:\). This note contains a link to the group’s TOR pages and a contact email address.
Figure 3. Play ransom note.
The “Play News” landing page lists the companies allegedly impacted by Play and a
countdown to the possible release of any data gathered by them. Organizations that have
refused to pay also have links to their data posted here.
There is also a contact portal where the group can be reached, an “FAQ” section that broadly
describes what the group has done, and steps for victims to take to restore their data.

As of this writing, the “Play News” page lists seven active victims currently being threatened.
The regional breakdown of the victims is below:

The regional breakdown of victims whose stolen data was leaked is as follows:

Based on this information, the Play ransomware threat actors appear to target victims
regardless of their region. The one caveat is that enterprises in former Soviet states do not
appear to be listed on “Play News”, although this may be coincidental.

Fortinet Protection
Fortinet customers are already protected from this malware variant through FortiGuard’s
Web Filtering, AntiVirus, and FortiEDR services, as follows:

FortiGuard Labs Guidance
Due to the ease of disruption, damage to daily operations, potential impact to an
organization’s reputation, and the unwanted destruction or release of personally identifiable
information (PII), etc., it is vital to keep all AV and IPS signatures up to date.
Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider
leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing
threats:
The FortiPhish Phishing Simulation Service uses real-world simulations to help organizations
test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper
practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks.
Our FREE NSE training: NSE 1 – Information Security Awareness includes a module on
internet threats designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from
various types of phishing attacks and can be easily added to internal training programs.
Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and
security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk
of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce
telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere.
Cloud-based security solutions, such as SASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced
endpoint security, such as EDR (endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt
malware mid-attack; and Zero Trust Access and network segmentation strategies that restrict
access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated
to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack.
As part of the industry's leading fully integrated Security Fabric, delivering native synergy and
automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of
technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our
global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts.

Best Practices include Not Paying a Ransom
Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, the FBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against
paying a ransom partly because payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered.
According to a U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)
advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional
organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit
activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by
ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaint page where victims can submit samples
of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3).
