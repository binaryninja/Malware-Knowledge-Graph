Executive Summary
Domain parking services offer a simple solution for domain owners to monetize their sites’
traffic through third-party advertisements. While domain parking might appear harmless at
first glance, parked domains pose significant threats, as they can redirect visitors to
malicious or unwanted landing pages or turn entirely malicious at any point in time.
We have been detecting parked domains for more than nine years. From March to
September 2020, we identified 5 million newly parked domains. In the same time frame, we
observed that 6 million parked domains have transitioned to other categories. Out of the
transitioned parked domains, 1.0% changed to malicious categories (such as phishing or
malware); 2.6% changed to not safe for work categories (such as adult or gambling); and
1/12

30.6% changed to suspicious categories (such as questionable or high Risk). Compared to a
benign domain (such as computer and internet info or shopping), a parked domain has an
eight times higher probability of changing its category to one of the above non-benign
categories.
In this blog, we further investigate the domain parking ecosystem and outline different types
of abuse, including:
Domain registration abuse: We observed the malicious life cycle of the domain
valleymedicalandsurgicalclinic[.]com, which is no longer active, as part of a global
Emotet campaign. Emotet is one of the most popular malware families distributed via
phishing emails. During this campaign, Palo Alto Networks observed attacks against
organizations in various industries (such as education, government, energy,
manufacturing, construction and telecommunications) all over the world, including the
United States, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, Korea and Italy. The attack
targeting French organizations also exploited the COVID-19 global pandemic: It used
Covid19 as the phishing email’s subject line. None of these attacks were successful.
Advertisement abuse (case 1): We observed attackers abusing the domain
peoplesvote[.]uk related to the current U.S. presidential election. While visiting
peoplesvote[.]uk, users are presented with an ad listing page most of the time.
However, occasionally, users are first redirected to 0redira[.]com/jr.php, which hosts an
exploit kit script, and subsequently users are redirected to a survey website asking
about users’ voting preference of Joe Biden or Donald Trump. The exploit kit script
hosted on 0redira[.]com/jr.php fingerprints the browser silently to track users’ web
activity and hides the landing URLs to prevent security companies and researchers
from analyzing and blocking them. Of note, these pages are still active as of this
writing.
Advertisement abuse (case 2): Furthermore, we observed a domain, xifinity[.]com,
mimicking xfinity[.]com. When a user attempts to visit the Xfinity website but
accidentally types an additional "i," they will go to xifinity[.]com and will be redirected to
an abusive landing page, antivirus-protection[.]com-123[.]xyz. Both domains are active
as of this writing. The landing page tries to fool users into believing that their machine
is infected and that their McAfee subscription has expired. Clicking on the “Proceed”
button will redirect users to a legitimate McAfee download page offering an antivirus
subscription. We believe that attackers are abusing McAfee’s affiliate program to steal
ad revenue.
Security best practice for enterprises is to keep close track of parked domains, while
consumers should make sure that they type domain names correctly and double-check that
the domain owners are trusted before entering any site.
Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall customers can block the parked category with
the URL Filtering and DNS Security subscriptions.

Domain Parking: Why and How
Individuals and enterprises need to pay registrars (ICANN accredited domain resellers) an
annual fee to buy domain names and become domain owners. If domain owners don't have
content or service ready to point their domains to, they can leverage parking services to
monetize user traffic. Setting up a parking service is simple and only requires domain owners
to point their name server (NS) records to the parking service. In return, parking services will
either present visitors with a list of advertisements or automatically redirect users to
advertisers' webpages. In the first case, domain owners and parking services get paid when
a user clicks on an ad, while in the second case, they get paid per user visit. Some domain
owners buy large amounts of domain names as an investment to resell them later for a profit
or to monetize user traffic. As shown by previous research studies and this blog, parked
domains can pose significant threats to end-users. Because of this, along with their
questionable utility, it may be best to block parked domains.
Palo Alto Networks has deployed a comprehensive pipeline to track newly parked domains
and to publish the detection results to URL Filtering. Recently, we have launched the parked
category in DNS Security as well. In particular, our pipeline:
1. Monitors known parked service providers and their infrastructure.
2. Tracks domain registrations and passive DNS queries and performs reverse DNS
lookups.
3. Crawls website content.
4. Employs machine learning to combine multiple features to classify whether a domain is
parked.
High-Level Statistics
To analyze the current parked domain landscape, we collected the parked domains that were
detected from March to September 2020, as well as the ones whose category changed from
parked to other categories in the same time span. On average, we found that 27,000 newly
parked domains were identified and 35,000 existing parked domains were re-classified daily.
In summary, our pipeline has identified 5 million newly parked domains and re-classified 6
million parked domains to other categories in the past six months.
Figure 1 summarizes how we observed parked domains changing during this time period.
For simplicity, we group the URL Filtering categories into four classes: malicious, not safe for
work, suspicious and benign. The malicious class consists of malware, command and control
(C2), phishing and grayware. Adult, gambling and nudity are represented in the not safe for
work class. For suspicious, we include questionable, insufficient content and high risk
domains. Sites are deemed questionable based on suspicious web content, while the
insufficient content category is normally applied to a blank website and high risk means the
domain displays behavior similar to malicious domains. The benign class encompasses all
other categories, such as business and economy, computer and internet info and shopping.

Figure 1 shows that for parked domains, the malicious change rate is 1.0%, the not safe for
work change rate is 2.6% and the suspicious change rate is 30.6%. As a comparison, the
non-benign change rate of the parked category is eight times higher than the non-benign
change rate of benign categories.

Figure 1. A list of categories that parked domains we observed changed to in the last six
months.
Figure 2 presents the distribution of the number of days that domains that we ultimately
categorize as malicious and benign are parked before changing their category. We
aggregate the number of category changes from parked for every 10 parked days and
normalize by the total number of domains per class. Figure 2 shows that over 25.9% of
parked domains that changed to malicious categories are parked for less than 10 days,
which is significantly different from benign, where the majority of them are parked for around
60-69 days. We conjecture that many cybercriminals do not age their domains (a practice
used to evade domain lifetime-based detection features) and use them to conduct attacks as
soon as possible.

The Ecosystem and Attack Vectors
In this section, we further investigate the benefits of detecting and blocking parked domains.
We begin by dissecting the domain parking ecosystem into different stakeholder groups. We
then show that the largest attack vector is domain registration, since attackers can register
parked domains and turn them malicious at any time. Second, we show that attackers can
abuse the lack of advertisement control by some smaller advertisement networks used by
parking services, thereby redirecting visitors to malicious or unwanted landing pages. Last,
we show that even a parking service itself can pose privacy threats to users.
Stakeholders
We show the major stakeholder groups in the domain parking ecosystem and their
relationships in Figure 3, namely domain owners, parking service providers, advertisement
networks and advertisers. Note that the term stakeholders as used here represents roles and
can refer to the same entity or multiple entities. Domain owners own parked domains and
have the incentive to monetize through parking service providers. Parking service providers
incorporate and organize feeds from advertisement networks to monetize user traffic.
Advertisement networks characterize user traffic from parked domains and present ads to
users from interested advertisers.

As mentioned previously, domain owners need to point their NS records to the parking
service’s name server to “park” their domains. We measured the popularity of service
providers by checking the DNS NS records of parked domains detected from March to
September 2020. Figure 4 presents the top 15 most popular NS domains. The majority of
parked domains are resolved by the NS of large registrars, including GoDaddy
(domaincontrol[.]com) and NameBright (namebrightdns[.]com). Besides the large registrars
and hosting providers, we identified several dedicated parking service providers. The most
popular dedicated provider is Sedo (sedoparking[.]com), which is used by 19.5% of parked
domains.

Domain Registration Abuse
Parked domains could present threats to users when they turn malicious. Figure 1 shows
that 1.0% of parked domains eventually changed to malicious categories such as C2 and
malware. Some attackers appear to host parked pages on their domains before deploying
malicious content, potentially to amortize their costs.
For example, we observed the malicious life cycle of the domain
valleymedicalandsurgicalclinic[.]com. This domain was registered on July 8, 2020. Our newly
registered domain detector found this domain, and our parking detector pipeline classified it
as parked based on the website content. Two months later, our malware analysis engine,
WildFire, captured multiple malware instances, such as SHA256:
a9fe73484674696be756808e93f839be7157cd65995d8de9e67e40bf77c9b229 and
54ac560845b09ce00a48b604ac7c440331cbde4362839a3dbf14c378230bee21 hosted on
the URL valleymedicalandsurgicalclinic[.]com/ujftb/statement/wr7hoba7i9hz since Sept. 14,
2020. Furthermore, we discovered that it's part of a global Emotet campaign (refer to our
recent Emotet blog for more information). Emotet is one of the most popular malware
families distributed via phishing emails. The documents attached to the phishing emails
contain macro scripts that call back to the C2 servers from victims’ machines. Emotet further
downloads Trojan payloads that steal victims' credential information or even compromises
their machines. We can see many suspicious behaviors from these files, including incorrect
file extensions and communication with multiple C2 servers, such as 50.91.114[.]38 and
51.38.124[.]206. We sketch the phases of the Emotet campaign in Figure 5.
The observed campaign was launched using multiple domains around the world. During this
campaign, Palo Alto Networks observed attacks against organizations in various industries
(such as education, government, energy, manufacturing, construction and
telecommunications) all over the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom,
7/12

France, Japan, Korea and Italy. The attack targeting French organizations also exploited the
COVID-19 global pandemic: It used Covid19 as the phishing email’s subject line (refer to our
COVID-19 scams blog for similar cases). None of the attacks were successful.

Advertisement Abuse
The domain parking ecosystem depends on advertisers to profit from user traffic. As
discussed earlier, parking services either show users a list of ads (and get paid based on the
number of user clicks on these ads) or redirect users automatically to the advertisers’
webpages (and get paid based on the number of user visits). Often the parking services and
the advertisement networks do not have the means or willingness to filter abusive advertisers
(i.e. attackers). Therefore, users are exposed to various threats, such as malware
distribution, potentially unwanted program (PUP) distribution and phishing scams. In our
experience, we most frequently observe the distribution of grayware.
We observed attackers abusing the domain peoplesvote[.]uk related to the current U.S.
presidential election, which was allowed by the lack of control by above[.]com, the seventhmost popular domain parking service, as shown in Figure 4. While visiting peoplesvote[.]uk,
users are presented with an ad listing page most of the time, as shown in Figure 6. However,
occasionally, users are first redirected to 0redira[.]com/jr.php, which hosts an exploit kit
script, and subsequently redirected to a survey website asking about users’ voting
preference, as shown in Figure 7. The exploit kit script hosted on 0redira[.]com/jr.php
fingerprints the browser silently to track users’ web activity and hides the landing URLs. Of
note, these pages are still active as of this writing.

Figure 7. The voting preference landing page that is sometimes seen after visiting
peoplesvote[.]uk and being redirected to a survey website.Furthermore, we observed
attackers abusing the largest dedicated parking service provider, Sedo. We found a parked
domain, xifinity[.]com, that is a typosquatting domain mimicking xfinity[.]com (refer to our
cybersquatting blog or this academic paper for more information). When a user attempts to
visit the Xfinity website but accidentally types an additional "i," they will go to xifinity[.]com
and will be redirected to an advertiser page. We identified that the traffic to this domain is
sold to multiple advertisers. One of the advertisers, softonic[.]com, presents users with a
software download page.
Besides legitimate advertisers, we also captured multiple redirections to PUPs from
attackers. Figure 8 shows one of the abusive landing pages, the level-squatting domain
antivirus-protection[.]com-123[.]xyz. The landing page tries to trick users into believing that
their machine is infected and that their McAfee subscription has expired. Clicking on the

9/12

“Proceed” button will redirect users to a legitimate McAfee download page offering an
antivirus subscription. We believe that attackers are abusing McAfee’s affiliate program to
steal ad revenue.
As a squatting domain, xifinity[.]com receives a high visit volume compared to other parked
domains. We observed over 1,000 DNS requests for xifinity[.]com in our passive DNS
dataset from June to September 2020, and the domain is still active as of this writing – as is
antivirus-protection[.]com-123[.]xyz. From a domain owner’s perspective, using a parking
service is a convenient way to monetize user traffic. However, as abusive advertisers (i.e.
attackers) are not filtered, users are exposed to various threats.

Parking Service Abuse
We observed several parked pages using ztomy[.]com, the 14th-most popular parking
service provider (shown in Figure 4), harvesting visitors' personal information. We observed
that these pages generate fingerprints of users' browsers and send them back to the parked
domain. The parked pages are using the browser fingerprinting script from pxlgnpgecoma.akamaihd[.]net/javascripts/browserfp.min.js, which collects various private information and
tracks user behavior. These browser fingerprints could be leveraged to track visitors’ online
activities, allowing advertisement networks to target visitors with ads tailored to them.
Additionally, domain owners complained online that their domains' NS records were
configured to ztomy NS servers without their awareness, which could be considered a form
of domain hijacking.

parking service provider.

Conclusion
In summary, parked domains can expose users to threats as they can redirect visitors to
malicious or unwanted landing pages or turn entirely malicious in the future. Due to their
questionable utility and the fact that our system can quickly re-classify parked domains when
they merit new categories, we suggest that Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall
customers block the parked category with URL Filtering or DNS Security. While this may be
deemed a bit overly cautious by some due to potential false positives, we suggest alerts be
set up for additional visibility at the bare minimum.
Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall customers are protected against malicious
indicators (domain, IP, URL, SHA256) mentioned in this blog via URL Filtering, DNS Security
and Threat Prevention subscription services.
