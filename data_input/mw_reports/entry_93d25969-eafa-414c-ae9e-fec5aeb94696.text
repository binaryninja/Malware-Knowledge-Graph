module 50251 and the
“Qwerty” keylogger
By Costin Raiu, Igor Soumenkov on January 27, 2015. 11:00 am
On January 17 2015, Spiegel.de published an extensive article based on
documents obtained from Edward Snowden. At the same time, they
provided a copy of a malicious program codenamed “QWERTY”
(http://www.spiegel.de/media/media-35668.pdf), supposedly used by
several governments in their CNE operations.
We’ve obtained a copy of the malicious ﬁles published by Der Spiegel and
when we analyzed them, they immediately reminded us of Regin. Looking
at the code closely, we conclude that the “QWERTY” malware is identical
in functionality to the Regin 50251 plugin.

Analysis
The Qwerty module pack consists of three binaries and accompanying
conﬁguration ﬁles. One ﬁle from the package– 20123.sys – is particularly
interesting.
The “20123.sys” is a kernel mode part of the keylogger. As it turns out, it
was built from source code that can also be found one Regin module, the
“50251” plugin.
Using a binary diﬀ it is easy to spot a signiﬁcant part of code that is shared
between both ﬁles:

Most of the shared code belongs to the function that accesses the system
keyboard driver:

Most of the “Qwerty” components call plugins from the same pack (with
plugin numbers 20121 – 20123), however there is also one piece code
that references plugins from the Regin platform. One particular part of
code is used in both the “Qwerty” 20123 module and the Regin’s 50251
counterpart, and it addresses the plugin 50225 that can be found in the
virtual ﬁlesystems of Regin. The Regin’s plugin 50225 is reponsible for
kernel-mode hooking.

This is a solid proof that the Qwerty plugin can only operate as part of
the Regin platform, leveraging the kernel hooking functions from plugin
50225.
As an additional proof that both modules use the same software
platform, we can take a look at functions exported by ordinal 1 of both
modules. They contain the startup code that can be found in any other
plugin of Regin, and include the actual plugin number that is registered

within the platform to allow further addressing of the module. This only
makes sense if the modules are used with the Regin platform
orchestrator.

The reason why the two modules have diﬀerent plugin IDs is unknown.
This is perhaps because they are leveraged by diﬀerent actors, each one
with its own allocated plugin ID ranges.

Conclusions
Our analysis of the QWERTY malware published by Der Spiegel indicates it
is a plugin designed to work part of the Regin platform. The QWERTY
keylogger doesn’t function as a stand-alone module, it relies on kernel
hooking functions which are provided by the Regin module 50225.
Considering the extreme complexity of the Regin platform and little
chance that it can be duplicated by somebody without having access to
its sourcecodes, we conclude the QWERTY malware developers and the
Regin developers are the same or working together.
Another important observation is that Regin plugins are stored inside an
encrypted and compressed VFS, meaning they don’t exist directly on the
victim’s machine in “native” format. The platform dispatcher loads and
executes there plugins at startup. The only way to catch the keylogger is
by scanning the system memory or decoding the VFSes.

This is astonishing information. It seems, if they put their collective
minds to it, they could take over the planet. Reminds me of earlry
James Bond and Spectre.
