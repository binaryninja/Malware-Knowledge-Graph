Staffing agency Randstad NV announced today that their network was breached by the
Egregor ransomware, who stole unencrypted files during the attack.
Randstad is the world's largest staffing agency with offices in 38 markets and the owner of
the well-known employment website Monster.com. Randstad employs over 38,000 people
and generated â‚¬23.7 billion in revenue for 2019.
This week, the Egregor ransomware operation published what they claim is 1% of
Randstad's data stolen during a recent cyberattack. This leaked data is a 32.7MB archive
containing 184 files, including accounting spreadsheets, financial reports, legal documents,
and other miscellaneous business documents.

Egregor ransomware data leak site
After the threat actors published their data, Randstad issued a security notification
confirming that the Egregor ransomware operation attacked them.
Randstad states that only a limited number of servers were impacted and that their network
and business operations continued to operate without disruption.
The company confirmed that data was stolen but is still investigating whether the personal
data of clients of employees was accessed. At this time, they believe that only data related
to their operations in the US, Poland, Italy, and France was stolen.
"To date, our investigation has revealed that the Egregor group obtained unauthorized and
unlawful access to our global IT environment and to certain data, in particular related to our
operations in the US, Poland, Italy and France," Randstad disclosed. "They have now
published what is claimed to be a subset of that data. The investigation is ongoing to
identify what data has been accessed, including personal data, so that we can take
appropriate action with regard to identifying and notifying relevant parties,"
The Egregor ransomware operation has been extremely active over the past week, with
successful attacks against Metro Vancouver's transit system TransLink and the big-box
department store Kmart.
Egregor is a new organized cybercrime ransomware-as-a-service operation that partners
with affiliates to compromise networks and deploy their ransomware. As part of this
arrangement, affiliates earn 70% of any ransom payments they bring in, and the Egregor
operators make a 30% revenue share.

The ransomware gang began operating in the middle of September 2020 after a prominent
ransomware group known as Maze shut down their operation. Threat actors told
BleepingComputer that many of the affiliates that worked with Maze switched to Egregor,
which allowed the new operation to ramp up their attacks quickly.
Other high-profile Egregor attacks include Cencosud, Crytek, Ubisoft, and Barnes and
Noble.
