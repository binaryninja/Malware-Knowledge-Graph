Background
Pay-Per-Install (PPI) is a malware service widely used in the cybercrime ecosystem that monetises the
installation of malicious software. As generally observed, a malware operator provides a Pay-per-Install
service operator with a payload, a requested number of installations, and a target geographical location. The
service operators are then responsible for distributing the malware sample based on the customer’s request, and
for which they will be paid. Actors selling “installs” play a key role in the distribution of threats, as well as the
underground economy.
To run this service, Pay-per-Install operators use tools to monitor the number of installations, location of infected
hosts, and other valuable installations-related information. For the most premium services, actors also operate
a modular loader enabling management of additional payloads, customising the attack chain, improving the
rate of successful compromise by reducing the detection of payloads.
While most Pay-per-Install services use their own traffic distribution network, some purchase traffic generation
services, such as those offered by traffers teams, to ensure wide and fast distribution of malware samples.

Introduction
SEKOIA observed that PrivateLoader is one of the most widely used loaders in 2022. It is used by a Pay-PerInstall service to deploy multiple malicious payloads on the infected hosts.
First observed in May 2021, PrivateLoader is a modular malware whose main capability is to download and
execute one or several payloads. The loader implements anti-analysis techniques, fingerprints the compromised
host and reports statistics to its C2 server.
SEKOIA analysts tracked PrivateLoader’s network infrastructure for several months and recently conducted an
in-depth analysis of the malware. In parallel, we also monitored activities related to the ruzki PPI malware
service.
The threat actor ruzki (aka les0k, zhigalsz) advertises their PPI service on underground Russian-speaking
forums and their Telegram channels under the name ruzki or zhigalsz since at least May 2021. Their business
model consists in selling bundles of thousand installations, located on systems all over the world, or
specifically in Europe or in the United States.
Our investigations on Dark Web forums allow us to assess with high confidence that PrivateLoader is the
proprietary loader of the ruzki PPI malware service.

PrivateLoader, a widespread loader in the PPI landscape
PrivateLoader is a downloader malware family first publicly reported in February 2022 by Intel471. The loader is
used as part of a PPI service, to deliver payloads of multiple malware families operated by several threat actors
or intrusion sets.
Following is an overview of the PrivateLoader malware capabilities, infrastructure and malware involved in its
campaigns.

Technical analysis
PrivateLoader is a modular C++ loader composed of three modules, including the loader to load the Core
module, the Core module contacting the Command and Control (C2) to get the URL to download the next
payload, and the Service module ensuring persistence.

2/14

PrivateLoader’s main purpose is to provide an environment where the next payload is downloaded and
executed. To be agnostic, the malware does not embed the next stage, the loader downloads the next payload
based on its configuration. The downloaded payload is obfuscated by customised operations developed by the
author and detailed later.
PrivateLoader core module offers the following functionalities:
Stack string obfuscation;
Host fingerprint (used for victim statistic on the C2 panel);
Next stage payload download over HTTPS and execution;
Anti-analysis techniques.
Execution of some samples highlight the presence of specifics Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs)
[https://tria.ge/220717-gpte2ahcbp, https://tria.ge/220826-kv1m3saahk]:
Impair defenses (disables Windows Defender Real Time protection);
The loader has its own Command and Control, used to gather victim statistics and to send next stage URLs via
multiple dead drop resolvers.
PrivateLoader’s main use consists in loading one or several third party malware. To do so, the loader contacts
hardcoded URLs which are obfuscated in the PE, it then requests the URL(s) that returns a dead drop resolver,
subsequently used to get another URL hosting the next stage payload.
After downloading the next stage, PrivateLoader deobfuscates its content using byte replacement based on the
following table:
Original Byte

Replacement byte

0x00

0x80

0x80

0x0a

0x0a

0x01

0x01

0x05

0x05

0xde

0xde

0xfd

0xfd

0xff

0xff

0x55

0x55

0x00

Table 1 : Byte replacement table
After the bytes substitution, the loader xors the payload content with the key `0x9d`. The downloaded
deobfuscated file starts with a magic that is removed before executing the valid PE. A script to extract
obfuscated payload is provided in the annex.

Communications
The communication of PrivateLoader is split in three parts:

3/14

1. The malware deobfuscates one or several embedded URL(s) not controlled by the attacker (tactic of dead
drop resolver);
2. It requests the embedded URL, the response is in plaintext and follows this format: `HOST:<C2 IP
address>`;
3. The infected host then requests the C2 over HTTP on a unique endpoint `/base/api/statistics.php`, the
response contains the final payload URL obfuscated using XOR operation;
4. Eventually, the malware downloads the next payload again, obfuscated with a different algorithm.

While the Dead Drop Resolver technique used by PrivateLoader can leverage legitimate websites such as
Pastebin, the malware can also use proprietary servers with URLs like `/servers.txt` and `/proxies.txt`. In the
latter Dead Drop Resolver option, C2 IP is drowned in a list of IP addresses, the correct one is obfuscated by
scrambling.
The communication with PrivateLoader C2 is obfuscated xoring the HTTP body with the key `0x6d`, a technique
consistently observed across all campaigns.
SEKOIA observed that PrivateLoader operators changed their final payload hosting provider over the summer,
shifting from Discord attachments to vk.com documents to host the downloaded payload. It is possible that
PrivateLoader customers are able to provide their own server to host the payload. As increasingly used by
several malware as C2 or as a files hoster, Discord is now under more scrutiny. It is possible this increased
monitoring was a driver for PrivateLoader’s recent hosting shift.

4/14

Figure 3. Domains hosting final payload downloaded by PrivateLoader observed in between 15 August and 3
September 2022
After downloading the next stage, if the core module is not configured to set up the service module,
communication with the PrivateLoader Core module is cancelled. Core module allows two configurations, the
first one will contact the C2 to load the Service module, the second configuration downloads other malwares and
ends its activity, all remaining communication in this specific configuration belongs to the next stage. SEKOIA
observed the second behaviour as the most widespread among campaigns involving PrivateLoader malware.

PrivateLoader infrastructure
The infrastructure hosts the C2 servers used by PrivateLoader operators to manage their service. PrivateLoader
samples communicate with these C2 servers to retrieve and exfiltrate data, as previously detailed in the
analysis.
At the time of writing, SEKOIA observed 4 currently active C2 servers:

Table 2. Active C2 servers on 6 September, 2022
Requests on publicly exposed endpoints (see the Part “Statistic URLs of PrivateLoader in publications of ruzki
service”) suggest that all IP addresses redirect to the same C2. This information is valuable in associating the
exclusive use of PrivateLoader to a specific PPI service.
5/14

To proactively track the PrivateLoader servers, we identified a heuristic based on the characteristic HTTP
response and the HTTP headers on port 80. The servers respond in 200 with a HTML page entitled “404 not
found” containing “(Ubuntu) Server at“, with PHP server headers.
SEKOIA also track PrivateLoader servers by searching for the specific PrivateLoader URLs
(/base/api/getData.php and /base/api/statistics.php) and their administration panel.
Monitoring the PrivateLoader infrastructure, we observed over 30 unique C2 servers. The volume of malicious
traffic generated by these servers suggests that the servers are fastly detected by security vendors. Moreover, it
is highly likely that the servers are eventually shut down if they are not provided by a bulletproof host.

Malware distributed by PrivateLoader
In last weeks’ campaigns SEKOIA observed, the following malware families were actively distributed by
PrivateLoader payloads:
Information stealers: Redline, Vidar, Raccoon, Eternity, Socelars, Fabookie, YTStealer, AgentTesla,
Phoenix and other uncategorized stealers.
Ransomware: Djvu.
Botnet: Danabot, SmokeLoader.
Miners: XMrig and other uncategorized stealers.
Other commodity malware: DcRAT, Glupteba, Netsupport, and Nymaim variant.
PrivateLoader distribution of malware families is documented in Intel471 and Bitsight reports, respectively over
the course of September-January 2021, and July-August 2022.
Based on the wide selection of malware families, which implies a wide range of threat actors or intrusion
sets operating this malware, the PPI service running PrivateLoader is very attractive and popular to
attackers on underground markets.

Ruzki, a popular Pay-Per-Install service
SEKOIA observed that PrivateLoader is one of the most widespread loaders in 2022. To better understand
the spread of PrivateLoader, we must consider the PPI service associated with the loader.
SEKOIA investigations on Dark Web forums led us to take a closer look at the ruzki PPI malware service.
Our observations from ruzki customer publications, botnets delivered by PrivateLoader and ruzki messages
allowed us to find evidence to link this PPI service and the loader.
After a brief description of the ruzki service, we present how we have associated this PPI service to the
PrivateLoader malware.

What is the ruzki Pay-per-Install service?
The ruzki PPI service consists of selling bundles of a thousand installations located on systems all over the
world, or especially in Europe or in the United States.
Since May 2021, the ruzki (aka les0k, zhigalsz) profile advertised the PPI service under the same name on the
Lolz Guru cybercrime forum. Their publications include pricing information, number of installs per day the service
can afford for one customer, and the traffic source. Similar publications are frequently posted by the same profile
on the Telegram channel (t[.]me/ZHIGALSZinstalls) associated with the services.

6/14

Figure 4. Les0k’s publication related to ruski’s PPI service pricing on 1 September, 2022 (source: Lolz Guru)
On 1 September, 2022, buying 1,000 installations on infected systems:
Worldwide (also called Mix world installs) costs $70;
Located in Europe costs $300;
Located in the United States costs $1,000.
All prices are degressive based on the quantity.
Ruzki threat actor recommends customers to buy unique installs packages for higher output. Indeed, a single
classic installation can be sold to several customers, making the output of the compromise low for them. While
unique installs are sold to a single customer. The exploitation of these installations is therefore more profitable
since the customer has exclusive access.
At its launch, the service could offer up to 20,000 installations per day. As of today, we have not found numbers
on the current capabilities of the PPI service. The traffic generation relies on an affiliate network that
represented, in May 2021, 800 webmasters leveraging multiple infection chains. SEKOIA suspects that one or
more traffers teams are behind these webmasters.
SEKOIA analysts were able to establish ruzki’s PPI modus operandi based on customers’ feedback, notably
shared through screenshots of their conversations with the ruzki PPI service operator. On another note, most of
the feedback was written following the ruzki operator on their Telegram channel.

7/14

Figure 5. Ruzki service operator post requesting feedback in their Telegram channel 30 mai
(traduction du message)
Below is an outline of the service, as observed by SEKOIA:
Step 1: The malware operator willing to distribute its payload contacts the ruzki service’s operator on Telegram
(t[.]me/zhigalsz), providing its requested number of installs and the target geographical location.
Step 2: The PPI service’s operator sets the price of the request, and provides the malware operator with a
cryptocurrency wallet address.
Step 3: The malware operator provides a proof of the transfer (oftentimes a screenshot of a cryptocurrency
application) to conclude the financial transaction, and supplies the payload it wants to distribute.
Step 4: The ruski service’s operator shares a password-protected link to follow statistics on the number of
installs related to the customer’s payload.
Step 5: Webmasters are responsible for distributing the customer payload.
Further analysis of the ruzki PPI service allowed SEKOIA to establish a link with PrivateLoader.

PrivateLoader’s association with the ruzki Pay-per-Install service
Several observations allow us to associate with a high level of confidence the PrivateLoader as the main tool of
the ruzki PPI service.

Statistic URLs of PrivateLoader in publications of ruzki service
In recent months, malware operators who subscribed to the ruzki service shared screenshots of conversation
with ruzki. These conversations contain a URL provided by the PPI service operator to its customers to monitor
statistics related to their campaign of installations.

PrivateLoader C2 server.

Redline campaigns associated to Ruzki botnets
While tracking PrivateLoader, we retrieved multiple PrivateLoader samples downloading the Redline information
stealer as a final payload. We were able to associate a majority of retrieved Redline’s samples to PrivateLoaderloaded botnets, including ruzki9, nam6.2, cryptex, @forceddd_lzt, ruzki, don_karl_installs, 3108_RUZKI,
persom, 2007329039 and riii_ff.
While evidence is very thin at this stage to formally associate these Redline botnets to ruzki, several botnets’
names suggest some sort of connection to the threat actor. One hypothesis is that ruzki’s customers could name
their botnet based on the PPI service they use to distribute their samples. Another hypothesis is that ruzki
operates the Redline malware in parallel to the PPI service activity.
Regardless of the operators behind the Redline samples, it is yet another indication of a likely connection
between PrivateLoader and ruzki.

A perfect timing
The ruzki operator was active on Telegram and Russian-speaking underground forums since at least May 2021:
The profile les0k advertising the ruzki PPI service joined Lolz Guru on May 1, 2021;
zhigalsz, the first Telegram channel associated with the service was created on May 7, 2021.
Additionally, Intel471 assesses that PrivateLoader is used since at least May 2021. Building upon previously
outlined observations, this increases our confidence in associating PrivateLoader with the ruzki PPI service.
In addition to the URLs shared to ruzki customers and Redline botnets named using “ruzki”, we observed that
the ruzki operator uses the term “our loader” in Russian on its Telegram channel.
Ruzki’s publication in Telegram channel associated with the service, on 16 February, 2022:
У нас своя сеть вебмастеров и мы являемсяклиенты, хочу вам соотрафика. Также наш лоадер каждый
день чистится и отстук около 80%. (Translated from Russian: We have our own network of webmasters and
we are clients, I want you to cooperate. Also, our loader is cleaned every day and the turnover is around 80%.)
Moreover, we identified a single botnet associated with all the PrivateLoader C2 servers. SEKOIA therefore
assess with high confidence that PrivateLoader is the proprietary loader of the ruzki PPI malware service.
The spread of PrivateLoader could therefore be explained by the following elements:

10/14

The popularity of the associated service among threat actors (competitive pricing, good service and
support, accessibility to less experienced threat actors and intrusion sets);
A distribution of PrivateLoader oriented on the quantity of installations, rather than on the quality;
A good coverage of this threat within SEKOIA, and more generally within the cybersecurity community.

Conclusion
Pay-per-Install services always played a key role in the distribution of commodity malware, and more
generally in the increase of the threat surface exposure. While the cybercrime ecosystem related to PPI
services is constantly evolving with new threat actors and emerging malware, the ruzki Pay-per-Install service
using PrivateLoader is established for over a year.
PrivateLoader became one of the most widespread loaders used for a PPI service in 2022. This downloader
malware is used to deliver multiple malware including information stealers, ransomware, botnets and miners.
Tracking PrivateLoader provides an interesting insight into prevalent commodity malware in the
cybercriminal landscape, as well as uncovering unidentified and emerging malware. As yet another turnkey
solution lowering the cost of entry into the cybercriminal market and a service contributing to a continuous
professionalisation of the cybercriminal ecosystem, it is highly likely more PrivacyLoader-related activity will be
observed in the short term.
To provide our customers with actionable intelligence, SEKOIA analysts will continue to track PrivateLoader C2
infrastructure, analyse malware technical evolution and monitor the ruzki Pay-per-Install service and their
customers.
