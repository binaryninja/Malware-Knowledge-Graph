ESET research: Appearances are deceiving with Turla’s
backdoor-laced Flash Player installer

Search

BY TOMÁŠ FOLTÝN POSTED 9 JAN 2018 - 03:00PM

ESET researchers have found that Turla, the notorious state-sponsored cyberespionage group, has added a fresh weapon to its arsenal that is
being used in new campaigns targeting embassies and consulates in the post-Soviet states. This new tool attempts to dupe victims into installing
malware that is ultimately aimed at siphoning oﬀ sensitive information from Turla’s targets.
The group has long used social engineering to lure unsuspecting targets into executing faux Adobe Flash Player installers. However, it doesn’t
rest on its laurels and continues to innovate, as shown by recent ESET research.
Not only does the gang now bundle its backdoors together with a legitimate Flash Player installer but, compounding things further, it ensures that
URLs and the IP addresses it uses appear to correspond to Adobe’s legitimate infrastructure. In so doing, the attackers essentially misuse the
Adobe brand to trick users into downloading malware. The victims are made to believe that the only thing that they are downloading is authentic
software from adobe.com. Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth.
The campaigns, which have been leveraging the new tool since at least July 2016, bear several hallmarks associated with the group, including
Mosquito, a backdoor believed to be the group’s creation, and the use of IP addresses previously linked with the group. The new malicious tool
also shares similarities with other malware families spread by the group.

Attack vectors
ESET researchers have come up with several hypotheses (shown in Figure 1) for how Turla-related malware can make it onto a victim’s computer
via the new method of compromise. Importantly, however, it is safe to rule out a scenario involving some sort of compromise of Adobe. Turla’s
malware is not known to have tainted any legitimate Flash Player updates, nor is it associated with any known Adobe product vulnerabilities. The
possibility involving a compromise of the Adobe Flash Player download website has also been practically discarded.

scenario under #5 is seen as very unlikely.

The possible attack vectors ESET researchers considered are:
A machine within the network of the victim’s organization could be hijacked so that it acts as a springboard for a local Man-in-the-Middle
(MitM) attack. This would eﬀectively involve on-the-ﬂy redirection of the traﬃc of the targeted machine to a compromised machine on the local
network.
The attackers could also compromise the network gateway of an organization, enabling them to intercept all the incoming and outgoing traﬃc
between that organization’s intranet and the internet.
The traﬃc interception could also occur at the level of internet service providers (ISPs), a tactic that – as evidenced by recent ESET research
into surveillance campaigns deploying FinFisher spyware – is not unheard of. All the known victims are located in diﬀerent countries, and
we identiﬁed them using at least four diﬀerent ISPs.
The attackers could have used a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) hijack to re-route the traﬃc to a server controlled by Turla, although this
tactic would probably rather quickly set oﬀ alarm bells with Adobe or BGP monitoring services.
Once the fake Flash installer is downloaded and launched, one of several backdoors is dropped. It could be Mosquito, which is a piece of Win32
malware, a malicious JavaScript ﬁle communicating with a web app hosted on Google Apps Script, or an unknown ﬁle downloaded from a bogus
and non-existent Adobe URL.
The stage is then set for the mission’s main goal – exﬁltration of sensitive data. This information includes the unique ID of the compromised
machine, the username, and the list of security products installed on the device. ‘Only’ the username and device name are exﬁltrated by Turla’s
backdoor Snake on macOS.
At the ﬁnal part of the process, the fake installer drops – or downloads – and then runs a legitimate Flash Player application. The latter’s installer is
either embedded in its fake counterpart or is downloaded from a Google Drive web address.

Mosquito and JavaScript backdoors
ESET researchers have seen in the wild, new samples of the backdoor known as Mosquito. The more recent iterations are more heavily
obfuscated with what appears to be a custom crypter, to make analysis more diﬃcult both for malware researchers and for security software’s
code.
In order to establish persistence on the system, the installer tampers with the operating system’s registry. It also creates an administrative account
that allows remote access.
The main backdoor CommanderDLL has the .pdb extension. It uses a custom encryption algorithm and can execute certain predeﬁned actions.
The backdoor keeps track of everything it does on the compromised machine in an encrypted log ﬁle.
Turla has been operating for a number of years and its activities have been monitored and analyzed by ESET research laboratories. Last year, the
analysts released pieces covering new versions of another Turla backdoor called Carbon, watering hole campaigns misusing a Firefox
browser extension and, most recently, a backdoor called Gazer.
