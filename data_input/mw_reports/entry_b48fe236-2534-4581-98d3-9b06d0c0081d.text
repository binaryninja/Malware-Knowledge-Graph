Executive Summary
Playful Taurus, also known as APT15, BackdoorDiplomacy, Vixen Panda, KeChang and
NICKEL, is a Chinese advanced persistent threat group that routinely conducts cyber
espionage campaigns. The group has been active since at least 2010 and has historically
targeted government and diplomatic entities across North and South America, Africa and the
Middle East.

1/12

In June 2021, ESET reported that this group had upgraded their tool kit to include a new
backdoor called Turian. This backdoor remains under active development and we assess that
it is used exclusively by Playful Taurus actors. Following the evolution of this capability, we
recently identified new variants of this backdoor as well as new command and control
infrastructure. Analysis of both the samples and connections to the malicious infrastructure
suggests that several Iranian government networks have likely been compromised by Playful
Taurus.
Palo Alto Networks customers receive protections from the threats described in this blog
through Advanced URL Filtering, DNS Security, Cortex XDR and WildFire malware analysis.

Playful Taurus Infrastructure
In 2021, the domain vpnkerio[.]com was identified as part of a Playful Taurus campaign
targeting diplomatic entities and telecommunications companies across Africa and the Middle
East. Since then, this domain and its associated subdomains have shifted hosting to several
new IP addresses. Notably, several of the subdomains currently resolve to 152.32.181[.]16.
Analyzing this IP, we identified an expired X.509 certificate that appeared to be associated
with Senegal’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), CN=diplosen.gouv[.]sn.

Table 1. Suspected Playful Taurus certificate.
Despite expiring in April 2021, this certificate continued to be associated with recent
infrastructure. For example, this certificate was first observed on 152.32.181[.]16 in April 2022,
a full year after it had expired. Coincidentally, that same month, subdomains for
vpnkerio[.]com began resolving to this IP.
Exploring all IP associations with this certificate, we found that this certificate was initially
associated with what we assess is likely legitimate Senegal government infrastructure. This
association remained consistent until the expiration of the certificate in April 2021. Following
its expiration, this certificate has been associated with nine different IP addresses. Eight of
those nine IPs have hosted Playful Taurus domains.

Observed Activity
Monitoring connections to the malicious infrastructure, we observed the following four Iranian
organizations attempting to connect to 152.32.181[.]16 between July and late December
2022.

Table 2. Iranian connections to Playful Taurus infrastructure.
The sustained daily nature of these connections to Playful Taurus controlled infrastructure
suggests a likely compromise of these networks. Moreover, these targets also fit historical
targeting patterns by the group.

Inside the Wire
While researching the Iranian infrastructure in Table 2, we found that the first IP
(109.201.27[.]66) hosted what appears to be a legitimate Foreign Ministry of Iran domain
(pro.mfa[.]ir) between May and November 2019. This IP also resides on a netblock that hosts
other Iranian government domains.
However, since September 2021, this IP has hosted the domain mfaantivirus[.]xyz. The use of
the .xyz top level domain (TLD) seems odd for an IP and netblock that hosts legitimate Iranian
government domains.
The registration record for mfaantivirus[.]xyz shows that it was registered by an organization
that has only registered eight other domains. Three of those domains, including
mfaantivirus[.]xyz, stand out for being hosted on Iranian government netblocks. The two
additional domains hosted on Iranian government infrastructure are as follows.

Table 3. Domains sharing a registering organization with mfaantivirus[.]xyz.
The first IP in Table 3 contains a reverse DNS pointer to cp.econsular[.]ir, and the second IP’s
netname is “Foreign Ministry of Iran.” This suggests that both are affiliated with the Iranian
government.
That said, further analysis of these IPs revealed associations with two X.509 certificates. The
earliest certificate appears to be related to pfSense and was only associated with these IPs for
a single day in August 2019. This leads us to believe that the two pfs1010.* domains are
made to resemble pfSense firewalls. The use of the domain name mfaantivirus[.]xyz loosely
fits the security theme as well.

4/12

The second certificate associated with the IPs in Table 3 is a self-signed certificate with a
common name of www.netgate[.]com. Netgate is the doing business as (DBA) name for
Rubicon Communications, who developed pfSense – again sticking with the pfSense theme.
Below is the information associated with that certificate.

Table 5. X509 certificate two – IP associations.
The first IP contains a historical certificate reference to portal-Share.mfa[.]new, which
suggests an ambiguous “Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA)” nexus. The second is a virtual
private server (VPS) owned by The Constant Company. This second IP (158.247.222[.]6)
hosted the domain www[.]delldrivers[.]in from July 7, 2022 to Oct. 11, 2022. This domain is
associated with a Turian backdoor sample.

5/12

Tying this all together, we identified Iranian government infrastructure establishing connections
with a known Playful Taurus command and control (C2) server. Pivoting on one of the Iranian
government IPs, we then identified additional infrastructure hosting certificates that overlap
with a second Playful Taurus C2 server.

Table 6. File details for Turian sample.
This sample was uploaded to VirusTotal from submitters in Iran on Nov. 12 and 13, 2022. We
further observed that these same submitters uploaded files and URLs that suggest a likely
affiliation with Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Technical Analysis
We found that this sample is packed with VMProtect. However, the final payload is not
virtualized and is ultimately unpacked into the .text, .data and .rdata sections of the payload.
Unfortunately, VMProtect obfuscates all API calls within the sample. So whenever an API call
is made, execution jumps to the .vmp0 section to resolve the import and execute it.
While the functionality of the sample becomes increasingly difficult to analyze due to the API
obfuscation, the strings within the unpacked .data section provide a useful pivot point for
identifying additional samples that contain the same functionality but are not packed with
VMProtect.
Alongside the strings, the sample also contains a fairly unique XOR decryption function
(shown in Figure 1). This is used to decrypt the embedded C2 server, update.delldrivers[.]in.

A similar algorithm has been seen within the Neshta file infector, back in 2014. Data encrypted
with this algorithm can be decrypted with the Python snippet shown in Figure 2.

Pivoting on the algorithm’s byte pattern {69 D2 05 84 08 08 8A 1C 30 42 32 DA 88 1C 30}
allows us to identify two additional malware samples.

The Turian Link
Aside from the C2 infrastructure being very similar in naming convention, comparing the code
bases of these samples to the unpacked VMProtect sample indicates clear overlap between
the functionality.
Due to the almost identical code base, we opted to focus our analysis on the executable,
rather than the DLL. Before doing so, we had a look at the DLL and noticed several cleartext
strings.

Searching for samples with similar strings, we identified two additional samples.

Table 10. File details of the second sample located via pivoting on registry strings.
These samples have been tagged in VirusTotal as being APT_MAL_LNX_Turian_Jun21_1,
which is a Linux version of the Turian backdoor. However, these samples are clearly not for
Linux systems. This tag did point us toward previous reporting on the Turian/Quarian
backdoors, which established a link between our dellux.exe sample and Turian.

An Updated Variant
Key differences between our samples and the previously documented Turian samples
indicated that we were likely looking at a newer version, with some additional obfuscation and
a modified network protocol.
The first key difference was the C2 decryption algorithm. In prior Turian samples, the C2s
were decrypted with an XOR against a hard coded byte, such as 0xA9.

Whereas in the dellux.exe sample, the algorithm has clearly been updated.
Additionally, the network protocol in use by Turian and Quarian backdoors has historically
been very distinct, especially during the initial key exchange. In this variant, the network
protocol has been altered to instead make use of the Security Support Provider Interface
(SSPI).
On startup, Turian will retrieve a pointer to the SSPI Dispatch Table via a call to
InitSecurityInterfaceA(), before calling AcquireCredentialsHandleA(). A socket is then opened
to the remote C2, using standard Winsock API, with connect() being called to establish a
connection.
Once a connection has been made, Turian then performs an SSL handshake with the C2.
This is done through a call to InitializeSecurityContextA(), which will return a token to send to
the C2 server.

9/12

Once sent, Turian waits for a 5 byte response (the SSL/TLS record header). This response
contains the length of data also to be received from the C2 server, after the initial header. The
remaining data is then passed into another call to InitializeSecurityContextA(), before
returning. At this point, the handshake has been successful and secure communications can
begin.
All packets sent to the C2 server are encrypted using the EncryptMessage() API, but are also
XORed with the key 0x56 beforehand. The same functionality is performed on received
packets, with the data being decrypted with DecryptMessage(), followed by XORing with 0x56.
The updated backdoor offers fairly generic functionality, from updating the C2 to communicate
with, to executing commands and spawning reverse shells. The main differences with this
compared to other variants of Turian are the command IDs. Whereas before, the IDs started
at 0x01 and followed an order, the IDs in this variant appear to be randomized.

Conclusion
Playful Taurus continues to evolve their tactics and their tooling. Recent upgrades to the
Turian backdoor and new C2 infrastructure suggest that these actors continue to see success
during their cyber espionage campaigns. Our analysis of the samples and connections to the
malicious infrastructure suggest that Iranian government networks have likely been
compromised. At the same time, we would also caution that Playful Taurus routinely deploys
the same tactics and techniques against other government and diplomatic entities across
North and South America, Africa and the Middle East.
