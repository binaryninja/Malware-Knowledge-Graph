While this article has more detail than another I saw on this, more clarity and less
jargon would be useful. Calling out windows as the POS is better than "device". But the
researcher seems to be making up useless jargon, "double XOR" is meaningless
without explanation. Binary operations 101 (pun intended) means XORing twice
undoes the XOR (A = A xor B xor B). So is this BS or are there different keys that
change in different instances?
