As we have noted before, attackers will leverage any file format they can to evade security
protections put in place by their targets. (https://cofenselabs.com/all-you-need-is-text/).
On Jun 11, 2020 we noticed an odd file extension show up in our analysis pipeline.

1/4

It was a jnlp file. The jnlp extension is short for “Java Network Launch Protocol” and is a
filetype used by Java with Java Web Start to load a java application. The file itself is a simple
XML based format that is easily readable. This however did not stop this file type from
evading a secure email gateway and finding its way in to a real estate industry mailbox.
The jnlp file format utilizes a similar URL building logic as we’ve seen in another technique
dubbed ‘basestriker’ where by the primary domain and the path are separate entities. This
may be the reason that this file format was selected. Below is the text of one of those files:

If this file was clicked and the user had java installed a couple of things would happen:
1) Java would load up the WHO website to make the user think the file is legitimate.
2) Java will also load the domain plus the “map.jar” file as the path and pull down and
execute that jar file.

We analyzed this and found that once the jar file is loaded, it downloads an exe which further
loads TrickBot. This can be seen in the following decompilation of that file:

Traffic analysis of the infection chain confirmed our findings with typical C2 traffic that is seen
from TrickBot, but with a gtag we have not seen before, chil.

While TrickBot is not a new threat, this delivery chain is highly unusual. Leveraging the
coronavirus as a lure as well as an uncommon file type likely to evade secure email
gateways for delivery, and it’s not hard to see how this could be a very effective campaign.
