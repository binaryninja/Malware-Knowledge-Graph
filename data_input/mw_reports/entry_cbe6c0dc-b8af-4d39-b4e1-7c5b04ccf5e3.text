Is ‘REvil’ the New GandCrab Ransomware?

The cybercriminals behind the GandCrab ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) offering recently
announced they were closing up shop and retiring after having allegedly earned more than
$2 billion in extortion payments from victims. But a growing body of evidence suggests the
GandCrab team have instead quietly regrouped behind a more exclusive and advanced
ransomware program known variously as “REvil,” “Sodin,” and “Sodinokibi.”
“We are getting a well-deserved retirement,” the GandCrab administrator(s) wrote in their
farewell message on May 31. “We are a living proof that you can do evil and get off scotfree.”
However, it now appears the GandCrab team had already begun preparations to re-brand
under a far more private ransomware-as-a-service offering months before their official
“retirement.”
In late April, researchers at Cisco Talos spotted a new ransomware strain dubbed
Sodinokibi that was used to deploy GandCrab, which encrypts files on infected systems
unless and until the victim pays the demanded sum. A month later, GandCrab would
announce its closure.

Meanwhile, in the first half of May an individual using the nickname “Unknown” began
making deposits totaling more than USD $130,000 worth of virtual currencies on two top
cybercrime forums. The down payments were meant to demonstrate the actor meant
business in his offer to hire just a handful of affiliates to drive a new, as-yet unnamed
ransomware-as-a-service offering.
“We are not going to hire as many people as possible,” Unknown told forum members in
announcing the new RaaS program. “Five affiliates more can join the program and then we’ll
go under the radar. Each affiliate is guaranteed USD 10,000. Your cut is 60 percent at the
beginning and 70 percent after the first three payments are made. Five affiliates are
guaranteed [USD] 50,000 in total. We have been working for several years, specifically five
years in this field. We are interested in professionals.”

Asked by forum members to name the ransomware service, Unknown said it had been
mentioned in media reports but that he wouldn’t be disclosing technical details of the
program or its name for the time being.
Unknown said it was forbidden to install the new ransomware strain on any computers in the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which includes Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan.
The prohibition against spreading malware in CIS countries has long been a staple of various
pay-per-install affiliate programs that are operated by crooks residing in those nations. The
idea here is not to attract attention from local law enforcement responding to victim
complaints (and/or perhaps to stay off the radar of tax authorities and extortionists in their
hometowns).
But Kaspersky Lab discovered that Sodinokobi/REvil also includes one other nation on its
list of countries that affiliates should avoid infecting: Syria. Interestingly, latter versions of
GandCrab took the same unusual step.
What’s the significance of the Syria connection? In October 2018, a Syrian man tweeted that
he had lost access to all pictures of his deceased children after his computer got infected
with GandCrab.
“They want 600 dollars to give me back my children, that’s what they’ve done, they’ve taken
my boys away from me for a some filthy money,” the victim wrote. “How can I pay them 600
dollars if I barely have enough money to put food on the table for me and my wife?”

That heartfelt appeal apparently struck a chord with the developer(s) of GandCrab, who soon
after released a decryption key that let all GandCrab victims in Syria unlock their files for
free.
But this rare display of mercy probably cost the GandCrab administrators and its affiliates a
pretty penny. That’s because a week after GandCrab released decryption keys for all victims
in Syria, the No More Ransom project released a free GandCrab decryption tool developed
by Romanian police in collaboration with law enforcement offices from a number of countries
and security firm Bitdefender.
The GandCrab operators later told affiliates that the release of the decryption keys for Syrian
victims allowed the entropy used by the random number generator for the ransomware’s
master key to be calculated. Approximately 24 hours after NoMoreRansom released its free
tool, the GandCrab team shipped an update that rendered it unable to decrypt files.
There are also similarities between the ways that both GandCrab and REvil generate URLs
that are used as part of the infection process, according a recent report from Dutch security
firm Tesorion.
“Even though the code bases differ significantly, the lists of strings that are used to generate
the URLs are very similar (although not identical), and there are some striking similarities in
how this specific part of the code works, e.g., in the somewhat far-fetched way that the
random length of the filename is repeatedly recalculated,” Tesorion observed.

4/5

My guess is the GandCrab team has not retired, and has simply regrouped and re-branded
due to the significant amount of attention from security researchers and law enforcement
investigators. It seems highly unlikely that such a successful group of cybercriminals would
just walk away from such an insanely profitable enterprise.
