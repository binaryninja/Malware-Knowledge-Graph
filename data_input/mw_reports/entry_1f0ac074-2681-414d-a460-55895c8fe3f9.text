Systems Affected
Network systems

Overview
This joint Technical Alert (TA) is the result of analytic efforts between the Department of
Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Working with U.S.
government partners, DHS and FBI identified Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and other
indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with two families of malware used by the North
Korean government:
a remote access tool (RAT), commonly known as Joanap; and
a Server Message Block (SMB) worm, commonly known as Brambul.
The U.S. Government refers to malicious cyber activity by the North Korean government as
HIDDEN COBRA. For more information on HIDDEN COBRA activity, visit https://www.uscert.gov/hiddencobra.
FBI has high confidence that HIDDEN COBRA actors are using the IP addresses—listed in
this report’s IOC files—to maintain a presence on victims’ networks and enable network
exploitation. DHS and FBI are distributing these IP addresses and other IOCs to enable
network defense and reduce exposure to any North Korean government malicious cyber
activity.
This alert also includes suggested response actions to the IOCs provided, recommended
mitigation techniques, and information on how to report incidents. If users or administrators
detect activity associated with these malware families, they should immediately flag it, report
it to the DHS National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) or the
FBI Cyber Watch (CyWatch), and give it the highest priority for enhanced mitigation.

NCCIC conducted analysis on four malware samples and produced a Malware Analysis
Report (MAR). MAR-10135536.3 – RAT/Worm examines the tactics, techniques, and
procedures observed in the malware. Visit MAR-10135536.3 – HIDDEN COBRA RAT/Worm

Description
According to reporting of trusted third parties, HIDDEN COBRA actors have likely been using
both Joanap and Brambul malware since at least 2009 to target multiple victims globally and
in the United States—including the media, aerospace, financial, and critical infrastructure
sectors. Users and administrators should review the information related to Joanap and
Brambul from the Operation Blockbuster Destructive Malware Report [1] in conjunction with
the IP addresses listed in the .csv and .stix files provided within this alert. Like many of the
families of malware used by HIDDEN COBRA actors, Joanap, Brambul, and other previously
reported custom malware tools, may be found on compromised network nodes. Each
malware tool has different purposes and functionalities.
Joanap malware is a fully functional RAT that is able to receive multiple commands, which
can be issued by HIDDEN COBRA actors remotely from a command and control server.
Joanap typically infects a system as a file dropped by other HIDDEN COBRA malware,
which users unknowingly downloaded either when they visit sites compromised by HIDDEN
COBRA actors, or when they open malicious email attachments.
During analysis of the infrastructure used by Joanap malware, the U.S. Government
identified 87 compromised network nodes. The countries in which the infected IP addresses
are registered are as follows:
Argentina
Belgium
Brazil
Cambodia
China
Colombia

Egypt
India
Iran
Jordan
Pakistan
Saudi Arabia

Spain
Sri Lanka
Sweden
Taiwan
Tunisia

Malware often infects servers and systems without the knowledge of system users and
owners. If the malware can establish persistence, it could move laterally through a victim’s
network and any connected networks to infect nodes beyond those identified in this alert.
Brambul malware is a brute-force authentication worm that spreads through SMB shares.
SMBs enable shared access to files between users on a network. Brambul malware typically
spreads by using a list of hard-coded login credentials to launch a brute-force password
attack against an SMB protocol for access to a victim’s networks.
Technical Details
Joanap

2/5

Joanap is a two-stage malware used to establish peer-to-peer communications and to
manage botnets designed to enable other operations. Joanap malware provides HIDDEN
COBRA actors with the ability to exfiltrate data, drop and run secondary payloads, and
initialize proxy communications on a compromised Windows device. Other notable functions
include
file management,
process management,
creation and deletion of directories, and
node management.
Analysis indicates the malware encodes data using Rivest Cipher 4 encryption to protect its
communication with HIDDEN COBRA actors. Once installed, the malware creates a log entry
within the Windows System Directory in a file named mssscardprv.ax. HIDDEN COBRA
actors use this file to capture and store victims’ information such as the host IP address, host
name, and the current system time.
Brambul
Brambul malware is a malicious Windows 32-bit SMB worm that functions as a service
dynamic link library file or a portable executable file often dropped and installed onto victims’
networks by dropper malware. When executed, the malware attempts to establish contact
with victim systems and IP addresses on victims’ local subnets. If successful, the application
attempts to gain unauthorized access via the SMB protocol (ports 139 and 445) by launching
brute-force password attacks using a list of embedded passwords. Additionally, the malware
generates random IP addresses for further attacks.
Analysts suspect the malware targets insecure or unsecured user accounts and spreads
through poorly secured network shares. Once the malware establishes unauthorized access
on the victim’s systems, it communicates information about victim’s systems to HIDDEN
COBRA actors using malicious email addresses. This information includes the IP address
and host name—as well as the username and password—of each victim’s system. HIDDEN
COBRA actors can use this information to remotely access a compromised system via the
SMB protocol.
Analysis of a newer variant of Brambul malware identified the following built-in functions for
remote operations:
harvesting system information,
accepting command-line arguments,
generating and executing a suicide script,
propagating across the network using SMB,
brute forcing SMB login credentials, and

3/5

generating Simple Mail Transport Protocol email messages containing target host
system information.
Detection and Response
This alert’s IOC files provide HIDDEN COBRA IOCs related to Joanap and Brambul. DHS
and FBI recommend that network administrators review the information provided, identify
whether any of the provided IP addresses fall within their organizations’ allocated IP address
space, and—if found—take necessary measures to remove the malware.
When reviewing network perimeter logs for the IP addresses, organizations may find
instances of these IP addresses attempting to connect to their systems. Upon reviewing the
traffic from these IP addresses, system owners may find some traffic relates to malicious
activity and some traffic relates to legitimate activity.

Impact
A successful network intrusion can have severe impacts, particularly if the compromise
becomes public. Possible impacts include
temporary or permanent loss of sensitive or proprietary information,
disruption to regular operations,
financial losses incurred to restore systems and files, and
potential harm to an organization’s reputation.

Solution
Mitigation Strategies
DHS recommends that users and administrators use the following best practices as
preventive measures to protect their computer networks:
Keep operating systems and software up-to-date with the latest patches. Most attacks
target vulnerable applications and operating systems. Patching with the latest updates
greatly reduces the number of exploitable entry points available to an attacker.
Maintain up-to-date antivirus software, and scan all software downloaded from the
internet before executing.
Restrict users’ abilities (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications,
and apply the principle of least privilege to all systems and services. Restricting these
privileges may prevent malware from running or limit its capability to spread through
the network.

4/5

Scan for and remove suspicious email attachments. If a user opens a malicious
attachment and enables macros, embedded code will execute the malware on the
machine. Enterprises and organizations should consider blocking email messages from
suspicious sources that contain attachments. For information on safely handling email
attachments, see Using Caution with Email Attachments. Follow safe practices when
browsing the web. See Good Security Habits and Safeguarding Your Data for
additional details.
Disable Microsoft’s File and Printer Sharing service, if not required by the user’s
organization. If this service is required, use strong passwords or Active Directory
authentication. See Choosing and Protecting Passwords for more information on
creating strong passwords.
Enable a personal firewall on organization workstations and configure it to deny
unsolicited connection requests.
Response to Unauthorized Network Access
Contact DHS or your local FBI office immediately. To report an intrusion and request
resources for incident response or technical assistance, contact DHS NCCIC
(NCCICCustomerService@hq.dhs.gov or 888-282-0870), FBI through a local field office, or
FBI’s Cyber Division (CyWatch@fbi.gov or 855-292-3937).
