A new information-stealing malware called ZingoStealer has been discovered with powerful
data-stealing features and the ability to load additional payloads or mine Monero.
The new malware was created and released for free by a group of threat actors named the
"Haskers Gang," who recently attempted to sell its source code for $500.
Soon after researchers at Cisco Talos spotted that offering, ZingoStealer changed hands
and was transferred to a new threat actor who will undertake the development effort.
Considering that the adversaries offer the info-stealer for free on both their Telegram and
Discord channels, and given the growing demand for this type of malware, its deployment
could rise to new levels.

An aggressive malware
The ZingoStealer first appeared in the cybercrime community in March 2022, promoted in
Russian-speaking channels as a "ready-to-use," powerful info-stealer in the form of a .NET
executable.
For only 300 rubles, worth approximately $3.64 at today's prices, users could also buy the
pre-built option that featured crypter obfuscation (via ExoCrypt) for upgraded resistance to
AV detection.
So far, ZingoStealer has been seen infecting computers via software cracks, and video
game cheats promoted on YouTube, but the infection vector could diversify at any moment.

From a data-stealing perspective, this is a potent malware targeting the following apps and
data points:
Web browsers: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Opera GSX
Cryptocurrency wallet extensions: TronLink, Nifty Wallet, MetaMask, MathWallet,
Coinbase Wallet, Binance Wallet, Brave Wallet, Guarda, EQUAL Wallet, BitApp
Wallet, iWallet, Wombat – Gaming Wallet

Cryptocurrency wallet data: Zcash, Armory, Bytecoin, Jaxx Liberty, Exodus,
Ethereum, Electrum, Atomic, Guarda, Coinomi
Cryptocurrency wallets: Bitcoin, Dash, Litecoin
Computer information: IP address, Computer name, Username, OS version,
Localization information, Processor information, System memory, Screen resolution,
Start time
All stolen info is saved in the "C:\Users\AppData\Local\GinzoFolder" folder, zipped, and
exfiltrated to the operator's server.

While the targeting list may appear extensive, it pales compared to the programs targeted
by other, more established info-stealers, most notably, the RedLine Stealer.

The simple solution to cover this gap in features is to have ZingoStealer deploy RedLine
Stealer, which in fact, is its most frequently deployed second-stage payload.
ZingoStealer performs a geolocation check to ensure the victim isn't located in a CIS
country, as it's predominately used by Russian-speaking actors, and then requests a list of
URLs for the retrieval and execution of more payloads.

In addition to the above, ZingoStealer also features the XMRig cryptocurrency mining
malware to use the victim's computer for direct financial profit.
This feature was added in a recent release, and uses PowerShell to add the necessary
exclusions on Windows Defender and execute the miner.

ZingoStealer's future

5/7

ZingoStealer is new, and its future is uncertain and volatile, but the fact that hackers can
grab it for free and deploy it without limitations makes it a candidate for becoming a
prevalent threat.
The competition in the field is now fierce as the information-stealer malware space has
become quite crowded lately, but if the new owners prove themselves capable,
ZingoStealer will continue to grow.
Given its malware loading capabilities and the custom crypter that gives it stealthiness, it
wouldn't be surprising to see it abandon its info-stealing aspirations and evolve into a
specialized loader.
As for how to protect against it, avoiding infections by not downloading software cracks and
gaming cheats from shady websites would be the best approach.
