Introduction
Transparent Tribe (APT36, Mythic Leopard, ProjectM, Operation C-Major) is the name given
to a threat actor group largely targeting Indian entities and assets. Transparent Tribe has
also been known to target entities in Afghanistan and social activists in Pakistan, the latter of
which points towards the assumed attribution of Pakistani intelligence.
This is the second blog of a two-part series on Transparent Tribe’s CrimsonRAT
infrastructure. You may read the first article here:
Part 1: A High-Level Study of CrimsonRAT Infrastructure October 2020 – March 2021

1/17

We have been tracking CrimsonRAT, Transparent Tribe’s most ubiquitous remote access
tool, over several months. This blog will present a deeper dive into the methods we use to
identify CrimsonRAT infrastructure and observations on specific artefacts which have allowed
us to attribute this infrastructure dating back multiple years.
Our intention is to provide supporting context to existing Transparent Tribe reporting and
IOCs, to aide in future threat reconnaissance activities against this group.
Key Observations
CrimsonRAT infrastructure is largely hosted on infrastructure leased by Pi NET LLC, a
Vietnamese VPS reseller.
An RDP certificate serves as a key indicator for CrimsonRAT and has been observed
on 17 C2 servers in total.
A methodology for tracing CrimsonRAT C2 servers was devised based on network
traffic patterns and the scanning of beacon ports.
CrimsonRAT C2 servers provide a standardized response when an initial TCP
connection is established.
Potential crossover login activity has been observed, linking multiple C2 servers
together, as well as providing a link to AhMyth AndroidRAT.
Eggs in One Basket (Pi NET LLC)
When reviewing CrimsonRAT C2 infrastructure an RDP certificate (with a Common Name
value of WIN-P9NRMH5G6M8) continued to appear. Our certificate data showed this
Common Name appearing across many of the previously identified ‘preferred’ providers (see
Part 1) used by Transparent Tribe. After reviewing rWhois records for IP addresses hosting
this certificate it became apparent that many, if not all these hosts, were being subleased to
Pi NET LLC.
A list of all 17 CrimsonRAT C2 servers hosting the Common Name WIN-P9NRMH5G6M8
certificate is provided at the end of this blog.
Expanding this search using Shodan’s data holdings, we were able to bolster our theory (the
association of the certificate with Pi NET LLC) as only a relatively small number of hosts
(240) were identified, the majority of which were either assigned directly to, or subleased to
Pi NET LLC.
Unfortunately, not all providers document the details of subleasing in Whois records, so we
were not able to tie ALL the IP addresses identified to a single entity (Pi NET).

2/17

Figure 1:

Shodan 240 hosts found with Common Name WIN-P9NRMH5G6M8
More recently we have also observed a different certificate in use on Pi NET LLC hosts, with
a Common Name of WIN-L6BUPB5SQBC. This certificate is associated with CrimsonRAT
C2s 134.119.181.15, 181.215.47.169 and 134.119.181.142 and moving forward could be an
alternative indicator of Transparent Tribe activity.
Reviewing Whois information for all CrimsonRAT C2 servers we have identified to date, we
found that roughly three-quarters (75%) were associated in some way with Pi NET LLC.
Therefore, we assess with moderate confidence that Transparent Tribe is hosting a large
proportion of (known) CrimsonRAT infrastructure through this single VPS provider, i.e., whilst
CrimsonRAT servers are overtly hosted with several different providers, it is likely that this
infrastructure is managed and sold by the small reseller Pi NET LLC.
Pi NET LLC (pivps[.]com) is a VPS reseller based out of northern Vietnam, which provides
very affordable Windows and Linux hosts accepting payment in various cryptocurrencies
alongside conventional methods.
Team Cymru attempted to contact the reseller about this activity but received a canned
response on how to submit an abuse complaint. Using the provided instructions we filed an
abuse complaint on 17 CrimsonRAT C2s.
Pi NET LLC’s known IP ranges are shared via our public GitHub
Sweep & Scan
In Part 1 of this research, we discussed how CrimsonRAT C2 servers communicated with ipapi[.]com when new victims beaconed in, providing us with an indicator to look for in our
network traffic data when reviewing activity surrounding potential C2 servers. The presence
of connections to ip-api[.]com therefore providing increased confidence that a particular IP
address was associated with CrimsonRAT activity.

3/17

The combination of knowing that a large proportion of C2 servers are hosted on Pi NET
leased IP ranges and that the C2 servers communicate with ip-api[.]com has allowed us to
develop a ‘sweep and scan’ technique over time, providing a process for identifying
CrimsonRAT C2 servers in the absence of publicly disclosed malware samples.
CrimsonRAT uses a custom C2 protocol where the first five bytes are the size of the rest of
the data. Figure 3 is an example of the response to the initial TCP connection to a port where
the CrimsonRAT server is listening.
Figure 2:
CrimsonRAT C2 response to initial TCP connection
This response provides us with a distinct signature for CrimsonRAT, made more distinct
when scanning IP addresses assigned to Pi NET LLC that have communicated with ipapi[.]com, which allows us to identify currently active C2 servers.
This signature can be implemented in open-source scanning tools (such as Nmap). An
example ‘nmap-service-probes’ file containing the signature for CrimsonRAT C2 servers is
available on our public GitHub (Happy scanning!)
The threat reconnaissance methodology is therefore as follows:
1.) Monitor network traffic for all known IP ranges of Pi NET LLC to identify hosts connecting
to 208.95.112.1:80 (ip-api[.]com).
2.) Review inbound connections to candidate C2 IPs looking for victims beaconing in from
Indian or Afghanistani-assigned IP addresses (TCP port range 2991–17443).
3.) If potential victim connections are observed, scan the identified port to detect and confirm
a CrimsonRAT C2 response.
4.) Step 2 can be skipped but would require a more exhaustive port sweep at Step 3.
When using the above methodology, many ‘known’ CrimsonRAT C2 servers were identified,
however two further servers (185.136.169.139 and 107.173.204.38) were also identified, that
to our knowledge, had not been publicly reported previously (and do not currently have a
malware sample associated with them).
185.136.169.139
Open Port: 3389
C2 Port: 4561,14565,28443
Sample: No sample found

4/17

107.173.204.38
Open Port: 3389
C2 Port: 6576, 8586
Sample: No sample found
An analysis of C2 185.136.169.139 shows victims beaconing in as recently as 01 June 2021,
with targeting concentrated in Indian-administered Kashmir.

Figure 3:

RDP Login Overlap (WeCanSeeYou)
In Part 1 of this research, we discussed our hypothesis that Transparent Tribe operators
likely managed their infrastructure via RDP, with TCP/3389 being observed open (and had a
service running) on 83% of the servers we analyzed.

5/17

When reviewing screenshot data from the Shodan data holdings for C2 173.249.2230, we
observed the user ‘MAINSERVER-PC’ visibly logged in at the time of the screenshot.
Pivoting on this finding has subsequently allowed us to identify potential crossover activity
dating back to May 2018.

Figure 4:

Caveat: this could be legitimate VPS administrator panel traffic or successful bruteforce
attempts on RDP. Since we were unable to speak with the provider we cannot confirm.
Reviewing the screenshot history of C2 173.249.22.30 in Shodan showed the following
activity timeline with logged in Machine Name and Date(s) Observed.
“MAINSERVER-PC” 2021-04-20, 2021-03-25
“MAIN_SERVER-PC” 2021-02-14, 2021-02-12, 2021-01-04, 2020-12-31, 2020-12-11, 202011-23, 2020-11-16, 2020-09-22, 2020-09-14

Based on these possible indicators of successful login activity, a review was undertaken to
capture this data for all known CrimsonRAT C2 hosts.
In addition to C2 173.249.22.30, a pattern of crossover login activity emerged for the
following C2 servers: 134.119.181.15, 151.106.14.125 and 167.86.89.53, between May 2018
and May 2021.
This activity highlighted the odd nature of the renaming of “MAINSERVER” to various similar
schemas, with the oldest login events showing “SHARPLINUX-PC”.

Figure 5: Overlapping RDP login events and timeline
As we were still skeptical of the link between these logins and Transparent Tribe, we decided
to map timestamps related to known CrimsonRAT malware samples (associated with the IP
addresses in question) to the timestamps observed in Figure 7.
The results of which are as follows:
134.119.181.15 – 940667b9051600cbfb471ebc70cda43b

As can be seen, the compilation and submission timestamps fall within the ranges detailed in
Figure 7, it can therefore be stated that Transparent Tribe were interacting with these C2
servers at the time the logins were observed.
As an additional measure to increase our confidence in these findings and to rule out the
usernames being indicative of default management activity undertaken by Pi NET LLC. A
VPS was purchased from Pi NET LLC, interactions with which confirmed that these
usernames were defined by the customer/end user – i.e., potentially Transparent Tribe
actors.
The usernames associated with these logins are therefore potential indicators of the group’s
activity.
Taking this analysis one step further, we were able to find crossover login activity that linked
CrimsonRAT C2s (198.46.177.73, 192.99.241.4 and 66.154.113.38) with an AhMyth
AndroidRAT C2 (212.8.240.221). In this case the usernames observed were ‘WATER-PC’
and ‘YouCantSeeMe’ (apparently WeCanSeeYou).

Conclusion
Transparent Tribe continue to pursue their intelligence collection objectives with CrimsonRAT
targeted mainly at Indian entities. In this two-part blog series, we have highlighted some of
the specific traits associated with CrimsonRAT infrastructure:
The likely use of RDP / Port 3389 for management activities
The prevalence of the Common Name WIN-P9NRMH5G6M8 certificate
Concentration of activity in Pi NET LLC
A discernible pattern in the response from the C2 server
Using the techniques that we have highlighted in this blog, it is possible to identify and track
C2 servers without first observing associated malware samples, providing an opportunity to
get a step ahead of the actors. By providing insight into these techniques, including the
sharing of the Nmap script, we hope to provide the means for others to trace Transparent
Tribe activities, to potentially limit their impact.
