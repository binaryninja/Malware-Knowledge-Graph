A new and targeted ransomware named AgeLocker utilizes the 'Age' encryption tool
created by a Google employee to encrypt victim's files.
Yesterday, a consultant created a topic in the BleepingComputer forums about a new
ransomware used in an attack against their client.
After examining the encrypted files, it was discovered that a text header was added to each
file that starts with the URL 'age-encryption.org,' as shown below.

An example of the text header appended to an encrypted file is below:
age-encryption.org/v1
-> X25519 O9LABKJJggKQAsCbCQzPQFz0XwOHXSljEJU2xwS3zHA
Ildq7HXhtndUkpcHnz1+jnFjkpPK8wrVbDSbYXye2wg
--- Rwz4uNO8q6DbP1gbGuSVIA7W2wUKNluxyvMHuAJNIyM

The URL age-encryption.org brings you to a GitHub repository for an encryption utility called
'Age' created by Filippo Valsorda, cryptographer, and Go security lead at Google.
According to the Age manual, the utility was designed as a replacement for GPG to encrypt
"files, backups, and streams."
"This is a design for a simple file encryption CLI tool, Go library, and format.
It’s meant to replace the use of gpg for encrypting files, backups, streams, etc.
It’s called “age”, which might be an acronym for Actually Good Encryption, and it’s
pronounced like the Japanese 上げ (with a hard g)."
Instead of creating a ransomware that utilizes commonly used encryption algorithms such
as AES+RSA, the threat actors behind AgeLocker appear to be using the Age command
line tool to encrypt a victim's files.

Ransomware decryption expert, Michael Gillespie, told BleepingComputer that Age
uses the X25519 (an ECDH curve), ChaChar20-Poly1305, and HMAC-SHA256 algorithms,
which makes it a very secure method to encrypt a file.
BleepingComputer has reached out to Valsorda to see if he had any advice that can be
offered to victims but has not heard back.

AgeLocker ransom note sent via email
It is not known how the threat actors are gaining access to victim's computers, but once
they gain access to the system, they utilize the Age encryption tool to encrypt the victim's
files.
While encrypting data, a custom extension created with the victim's initials will be appended
to each encrypted filename.
In a first for ransomware infections, instead of creating ransom notes on the encrypted
system, the attackers emailed the ransom demand to the victim.
After the company's devices were encrypted in the reported attack, they received an email
with a subject line of "[company name] security audit."
This ransom note listed the devices encrypted by the ransomware and instructions on how
to get payment information.

According to the victim, the threat actors are asking for 7 bitcoins, or approximately
$64,500, to decrypt the files.

Unfortunately, it does not appear possible to recover files encrypted by Age for free at this
time.
