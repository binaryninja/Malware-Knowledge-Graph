This Ransomware Demands Nudes Instead of Bitcoin
motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/yw3w47/this-ransomware-demands-nudes-instead-of-bitcoin

For years, cybercriminals have been extorting victims by locking their computers with
malware. The hackers promise to give the victim their files back as long as they fork over the
cryptocurrency—typically Bitcoin—within the stipulated time limit. Now, someone has added
a new, perverse twist to this tried and tested scheme: demanding naked photographs instead
of Bitcoin.
Researchers at MalwareHunterTeam, a research group focused on ransomware, spotted the
software, called nRansomware on Thursday. The group posted a screenshot of the message
that's displayed when a victim gets infected:
"Your computer has been locked," reads the message, which then asks the victim to email
the hackers. "After we reply, you must send at least 10 nude pictures of you. After that we
will have to verify that the nudes belong to you."
The message is displayed on top of an haphazard background made of several images of
the fictional children's character Thomas the Tank Engine and a smiley face with the writing
"FUCK YOU!!!" in bold. It's not clear how many people have been hit with this ransomware,
or how serious the hackers behind it really are.

To some extent, the malware does appear to be legitimate. The file, nRansom.exe, is
classified as malicious by several antivirus engines, including VirusTotal and Hybrid Analysis,
which are both public malware repositories. Other users on Twitter also reported spotting
more samples of this particular ransomware.
Malware can end up on these repositories if someone manually submits an entry and details
what and does and how, or if malware is submitted and is then automatically analyzed.
Motherboard attempted to infect a virtual machine with the malware but was unable to do so.
This could very well be a prank, given that it doesn't actually encrypt files, according to
MalwareHunterTeam and another researcher who looked at the malware.
"It is a screenlocker, so files aren't encrypted," MalwareHunterTeam told Motherboard in a
Twitter direct message. "We have no information about anyone getting infected with this."
The malware also appears to play looped music—from a file called your-mom-gay.mp3 that
is actually the Curb Your Enthusiasm theme song—in the background, according to the
MalwareHunterTeam.
We contacted the hackers via the email address included in their ransom message. They
didn't immediately respond to our questions.
In any case, while this ransomware is clearly gross, sadly, it's not unexpected. Hackers have
for years used malware to spy on women and steal their nudes or access their webcams.
This story has been updated to note that this ransomware doesn't actually encrypt files.
