Russian anti-virus company Doctor Web is reporting the emergence of the first crossplatform backdoor to run under Linux and Mac OS X. This malicious program is
designed to steal passwords stored by a number of popular Internet applications.
Mac.BackDoor.Wirenet.1 is the first such Trojan capable of running under any of these
operating systems.
It's not clear yet how the Trojan, which was added to the Dr.Web virus database as
Mac.BackDoor.Wirenet.1, spreads. This malicious program is a backdoor that can work
under Linux as well as under Mac OS X.
When launched, it creates its copy in the user's home directory. The program uses the
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to communicate with its control server whose address
is 212.7.208.65.

Mac.BackDoor.Wirenet.1 also operates as a keylogger (it sends gathered keyboard input
data to intruders); in addition, it steals passwords entered by the user in Opera, Firefox,
Chrome, and Chromium, and passwords stored by such applications as Thunderbird,
SeaMonkey, and Pidgin. Anti-virus software from Doctor Web successfully detects and
removes the backdoor, so the threat does not pose a serious danger to systems protected by
Dr.Web for Mac OS X and Dr.Web for Linux.
