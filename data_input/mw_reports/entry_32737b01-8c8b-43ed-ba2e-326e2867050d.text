As the war in Ukraine rages on, unseen but related battles occur daily across the globe.
These confrontations stem from pro-Russian hacktivist groups targeting countries that
support Ukraine, likely with support from the Kremlin. These hacktivists have been targeting
a wide swath of industries and sectors, including aviation, energy, financial, government and
public safety, technology, media and telecommunications sectors.
Hacktivism is the combination of hacking (unauthorized access to or control over computer
network security systems for some illicit purpose) and political activism. Because of this,
hacktivists have social and political agendas as opposed to hackers who commit cyber
crimes for profit and often times infamy. It should be noted that many pro-Russian hacktivists
are also likely to be hackers responsible for attacks across enterprises and governments.
Pro-Russian hacktivist activity

The pro-Russian hacktivist groups targeting governments and organizations that oppose
Russia's stance on the war in Ukraine have been observed using several cyber tactics,
including DDoS attacks, network intrusion and stealing personally identifiable information
(PII).
In July and August 2022, numerous hacktivist groups accelerated their nefarious activities.
The most impactful Ukrainian-specific incidents conducted by major pro-Russian hacktivist
groups detected by Intel 471 were:
Народная Cyberармия (Eng. People's CyberArmy) aka CyberArmyRussia: The
faction conducted multiple DDoS attacks against entities in Europe and Ukraine across
many industries, targeting Ukrainian news outlets and local government websites. Their
most significant targets were in August when group members attacked the website of
Ukraine's nuclear power company, Energoatom. The cyberattack came as tensions
flared over the Zaporizhzhia power plant in the south of Ukraine, occupied by Russian
forces since March 2022. They also targeted the European Space Agency following
news that Finnish company ICEYE agreed to provide the Ukrainian government access
to the SAR satellite constellation to fight against Russian aggression.

CyberArmyRussia members continue to proclaim their opposition to the "West,
European Union and Ukraine" and release pro-Russian propaganda articles and
videos in addition to website breach announcements.

FRwL Team, aka From Russia with Love, Z Team: Group members published the
personal data of people who support Ukraine or oppose the actions of Russia. They
also allegedly publish classified Ukrainian and U.S. documents as hacktivist resources.
KillNet: Gang members attacked the RuTor forum (a predominantly Russian-speaking
underground forum), which they claim is sponsored by the Ukrainian government. NBP
Hackers joined the effort to disable the RuTor forum and called for other hackers to
participate. KillNet also claims the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) paid them one
million rubles (about $16,000 US) to stop an attack against the RuTor forum.
On August 17, 2022, KillNet claimed responsibility for extensive cyberattacks in Estonia
shortly after government officials decided to remove Soviet-era monuments near the border
with Russia. KillNet also allegedly blocked access to over 200 private and Estonian state
institutions, including banks, government organizations, payment systems and public
services.
NBP Hackers: This group released personal information of Ukraine's government
officials and high-profile personas perceived as enemies of Russia. They also
encourage the hacking community to join their efforts in disabling the RuTor forum,
adding to the efforts of the KillNet gang.
NoName057(16): This hacktivist group, the most active of the groups on this list, conducted
multiple DDoS attacks against entities in Norway, prompted by the decision of Norwegian
authorities to block Russian cargo to the Svalbard archipelago. In addition, members
attacked numerous companies from the financial and government sectors in Lithuania,
apparently due to the country's ban on transporting goods and cargo to the Kaliningrad
region of Russia. The gang also conducted massive attacks on the Polish government and
transportation sectors, including airports in Kraków, Warsaw and Wrocław, the gas pipeline
EuRoPol, the logistics company PKP Cargo and defense weapon and military equipment
provider Polski Holding Obronny. Last but by no means least, group members attacked
various Finnish, Latvian and Polish government agencies all considered to be sympathetic to
the Ukrainian effort. The graph below shows a breakdown of the impacted entities by
country.

Due to the very nature of state-sponsored cyber attacks, there is limited conclusive evidence
that the Kremlin is directing or supporting the aforementioned hacktivism. Although the link
likely exists and state-sponsored hacking is nothing new, the Kremlin will be sure to distance
itself from any malign activity so as not to risk breaching NATOs Collective Defence treaty,
Article 5. In any case, companies, enterprises and governments should limit their attack
surface, ensure that software patching is conducted routinely and invest in increased threat
detection capabilities in the face of Russian cyber aggression.
