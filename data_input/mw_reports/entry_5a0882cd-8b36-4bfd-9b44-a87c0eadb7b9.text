Karkoff 2020: a new APT34 espionage operation involves
Lebanon Government

Introduction
In November 2018, researchers from Cisco Talos tracked and detailed a
“DNSEspionage” campaign against targets in Lebanon and UAE. At the time of the report,
the threat actor carried out a cyber espionage campaign by redirecting DNS traffic from
domains owned by the Lebanon government to target entities in the country.
In April 2019, Cisco Talos discovered evidence of the link between APT34 (codename Helix
Kitten or OilRig) and the “DNSEspionage” operation. Talos analysts discovered several
overlaps in the infrastructure employed by attackers and identified common TTPs. They
tracked this new implant “Karkoff”.
Experts from Cybaze/ Yoroi Zlab, as part of ordinary Threat Intelligence activities, spotted a
new sample which they believe to be an update of the Karkoff implant. It could prove that
APT34 is still active and threat actors used it in a new campaign that appears to be active at
the time of writing. The APT group made some changes in its technique, tactics, and
procedures, but the target is the same, the Lebanon Government.
1/5

In this campaign, the APT group may have compromised a Microsoft Exchange Server
belonging to a Lebanon government entity, in fact, we found some evidence in the
communication logic.
This new implant has some similarities with the samples of Karkoff involved in past
campaigns, including:
similar Macro structure
.NET modular implant with similar logic
exploit Microsoft Exchange Server as communication channel
Moreover, the new Karkoff implant implements a new reconnaissance logic in order to drop
the final payload only to specific targets, gathering system information, the domain name,
hostname and running Operating System.

Update
A few hours before this report has been publicly disclosed, malware researchers at the
Italian cyber security firm Telsy also published their analysis.
Both reports are related to the same sample, but let me suggest reading both analyses to
have a clear vision of the threat actors and all the technical details related to the implant. The
report published by Telsy is available here: LINK.

Description

Malicious Excel macro

Table 1. Sample information
The Malware is an Excel Document with a malicious macro embedded. The following image
(Fig:1) shows the highlights of the extracted code.
Fig.1. Malicious Macro: drop and execute monitor.exe
The macro extracts a custom base64 code from the body of the file and, after a decoding
routine, it downloads an executable file into the following path
“C:\Users\public\.Monitor\monitor.exe”. Persistence is assured by scheduling a new task
named SystemExchangeService.

The extracted payload is summed up as follows: :
Fig.3.Static details of monitor.exe
The payload were not obfuscated at all. This made a simple and quick analysis.
As shown in the above figure, the creation date is on 29 February, this is an indicator of the
recent build of this implant. Moreover, a small file size (1.13MB) allows malicious content to
be downloaded and executed quickly.

As the first step, as shown in Fig 4, the sample tries to connect to its own command and
control server, which happens to be an Exchange mail server belonging to the Lebanon
government. Once it connects, the C2 answers back with the list of available commands as
attachments in a replied e-mail. Fig 5 shows the GetList function from where we might
appreciate the eMail body decoding process. From the body, a custom encoded string is
decoded and later it is interpreted as a command.

attachments
Following our analysis, we noticed the malware tries to connect back and forth to its C2 to
get authorization and to share detailed information about the infected system. It used
“UserAgent” of the exchange client. Fig 6 shows details on what is hijacked from the victim’s
side.

Another evidence is the domain registration of the second command control: it has been
registered on January, 27, probably indicating the date of the beginning of the new attack.

Conclusions
APT34 is still active, and this campaign against the Lebanon government demonstrates it.
The new version of the Karkoff malware is the demonstration that the Iran-linked APT34
cyberespionage group continues to improve its arsenal. The sample involved in this
campaign implements new reconnaissance capabilities, it implements a covert and effective
C2 communication channel through the use of the Microsoft Exchange Protocol.

3/5

The Group likely exploited or brute-forced a Lebanon related mail account with another tool
of its arsenal, the JASON tool. The Jason tool was leaked at the end of 2019, it could be
used by attackers to carry out bruteforce attacks on exchange servers.
