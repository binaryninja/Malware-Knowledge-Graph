Threat Actors Create Phishing Websites for Mass Infection
Cyble Research & Intelligence Labs (CRIL) identified massive phishing campaigns running on YouTube as
tutorials for downloading and installing cracked software, Games for free.
The video tutorial tricks the users into installing Information stealer from the link given in the video
description and lures them into believing it is a crack for their desired software.
We have seen many similar campaigns in the past, downloading Pennywise and Redline stealer. In these
types of campaigns, the Threat Actor (TA) usually hosts the malicious file in the free file hosting platform.
Still, in this case, the TA has created phishing pages mimicking legitimate websites that provide service to
users for downloading various software, games, and other tools.

Going through the different campaigns, we identified several phishing websites mentioned in the video
description. The TA has created phishing pages to increase the chances of successful infection. Also, the
impact of this campaign can be calculated based on the number of views on each video posted. The
maximum number of views we observed on a single video is 18k, indicating the campaign is widespread.

The below image depicts the comments in the YouTube videos. Similar comments from different YouTube
videos conclude that the TA adds these to convince users to think this software is legitimate.

YouTube Campaigns Analysis:
During our research, we observed that the TA responsible for running these campaigns primarily targets
people looking to get paid software for free such as games, programs, etc. To get this software for free,
people usually search keywords like “software cracks,” “keygens,” etc. The search result of these keywords
redirects users to these YouTube videos, guiding them to install malicious executables pretending to be the
software they wanted to install.

Most of the binaries hosted on these phishing sites act as either downloaders or droppers for the stealer
payload. The malware infection happens in multiple stages and at the end, executes the stealer payload.
These stealers mainly exfiltrate sensitive user data such as cookies, system information, login credentials,
etc. to their Command and Control (C&C) server.
This exfiltrated data is referred to as Stealer Logs , which are usually sold on cybercrime marketplaces and
can be leveraged by other TAs to target individuals or get into corporate networks. The phishing campaign
discussed in this blog was mainly distributing Vidar and RecordBreaker stealer.

Vidar Stealer
Vidar InfoStealer is based on C/C++ programming language. The Vidar malware family, which was first
identified in 2018, can steal sensitive data from the victim’s PC. This includes banking information, saved
passwords, IP addresses, browser history, login credentials, and crypto wallets, which can then be
transferred to the TAs Command and C&C. We witnessed in past also where TAs used delivery
mechanisms such as spam mail, cracked software, keygens, etc. to distribute this malware.

RecordBreaker Stealer
RecordBreaker stealer is suspected to be a recent version of the Raccoon stealer, which was spotted in
the wild in 2022. While executing, this stealer performs several GET\POST requests with Command and
Control (C&C) Server. Initially, it fetches the configuration and DLLs and then exfiltrates the victim’s data to
C&C using a POST request. The stealer can also deliver other malware payloads based on the
configuration’s settings. The figure below shows the stealer receiving configuration file.

Conclusion
Threat Actors are constantly enhancing their techniques to deliver malicious programs. In this particular
case, the TA uses YouTube channels to spread malicious payloads hosted on phishing websites. This
campaign primarily leverages YouTube videos (with step-by-step tutorials) to trick users into installing
malicious programs on their systems. CRIL has been observing increasing trends in social media scams of
late.
Cyble Research and Intelligence Labs’ mission is to continuously monitor and alert our audience to hightech cyber scams and protect our clients in cyberspace by supporting them in achieving their goals.

Our Recommendations
We have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against
attackers. We recommend that our readers follow the best practices given below:
Avoid downloading pirated software from unverified sites.
Use strong passwords and enforce multi-factor authentication wherever possible.
Keep updating your passwords after certain intervals.
Use a reputed anti-virus and internet security software package on your connected devices, including
PC, laptop, and mobile.
Refrain from opening untrusted links and email attachments without first verifying their authenticity.
Block URLs that could be used to spread the malware, e.g., Torrent/Warez.
Monitor the beacon on the network level to block data exfiltration by malware or TA.
Enable Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Solutions organization wide.
