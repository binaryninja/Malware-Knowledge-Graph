Executive Summary
GPS and other Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are used in everything from cellular
communication networks, to basic consumer goods, high-end military systems, and stock
trading inputs. But these systems are vulnerable: by attacking positioning, navigational, and
timing (PNT) data through electronic warfare (EW) capabilities, state and non-state actors can
cause significant damage to modern militaries, major economies, and everyday consumers
alike.1 2 3 With recent technological advances, the tools and methodologies for conducting this
interference are now at a high risk for proliferation. GNSS attacks are emerging as a viable,
disruptive strategic threat.
In this report, we present findings from a year-long investigation ending in November 2018 on
an emerging subset of EW activity: the ability to mimic, or “spoof,” legitimate GNSS signals in
order to manipulate PNT data. Using publicly available data and commercial technologies, we
detect and analyze patterns of GNSS spoofing in the Russian Federation, Crimea, and Syria that
demonstrate the Russian Federation is growing a comparative advantage in the targeted use
and development of GNSS spoofing capabilities to achieve tactical and strategic objectives at
home and abroad. We profile different use cases of current Russian state activity to trace the
activity back to basing locations and systems in use.
●● In Section One, we examine GNSS spoofing events across the entire Russian Federation,
its occupied territories, and overseas military facilities. We identify 9,883 suspected
instances across 10 locations that affected 1,311 civilian vessel navigation systems since
February 2016. We demonstrate that these activities are much larger in scope, more
diverse in geography, and longer in duration than any public reporting suggests to date.
●● In Section Two, we examine the role of Russian GNSS spoofing for very important
person (VIP) protection. We find a close correlation between movements of the Russian
head of state and GNSS spoofing events. We believe the Russian Federal Protective
Service (FSO) operates mobile systems to support this activity. Through a review of
Russian procurement data, we identify one possible mobile system, manufactured by a
company closely connected to the FSO.
●● In Section Three, we profile the use of Russian GNSS spoofing for strategic facilities
protection. We identify potential technology in use for facility protection in Moscow. We
also highlight spoofing activities taking place in proximity to protected facilities on the
coast of Russia and Crimea in the Black Sea. Through a line of sight analysis, we judge
the most likely placement for a GNSS spoofing transmitter on the Black Sea to be at a
multi-million dollar “palace,” formerly owned by reported family members of senior FSO
officers and previously reported to be built for President Putin.
●● Finally, in Section Four, we expose the use of GPS spoofing in active Russian combat
zones, particularly Syria, for airspace denial purposes. This is a capability scarcely
reported in the public domain. Using data from a scientific sensor on the International
Space Station (ISS), we are able to identify ongoing activity that poses significant threats
to civilian airline GPS systems in the region. We pinpoint the most likely location for
the system to the northwestern quadrant of Khmeimim airbase, and identify potential
military-grade EW systems in use through publicly available information.
The Russian Federation has a comparative advantage in the targeted use and development
of GNSS spoofing capabilities. However, the low cost, commercial availability, and ease of
deployment of these technologies will empower not only states, but also insurgents, terrorists,
and criminals in a wide range of destabilizing state-sponsored and non-state illicit networks.
GNSS spoofing activities endanger everything from global navigational safety to civilian finance,
logistics, and communication systems.

Methodology
This report presents findings from a year-long investigation ending in November 2018
on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) spoofing activities affecting civilian GNSS
receivers in the Russian Federation, its occupied territories, and the Syrian Arab Republic.
Through our reporting we seek to illustrate the effectiveness of using publicly available
data and technologies to report on GNSS interference activities. The report presents
case studies on three unique applications of GNSS spoofing, highlighting Russia’s role
in pioneering the use of these capabilities to protect and promote its strategic interests.
In each case study, we relied on publicly available information such as: GNSS positioning
data, official records, news and social media reporting, and satellite imagery. Following
an examination of publicly available data, we collaborated with The University of Texas
at Austin (UT). Using signal recordings from a GPS receiver based on the International
Space Station (ISS) in low-Earth-orbit (LEO), we characterized, mapped, and identified
potential basing locations and equipment involved in GNSS spoofing activities in Syria.
We then examine the broader ramifications of these findings.
Any mention of GNSS refers to space-based navigation systems such as the US Global
Positioning System (GPS/NAVSTAR), Russia’s Global Navigation Satellite System
(GLONASS), the European Union’s Galileo System, China’s Beidou Navigation Satellite
System, India’s Navigation Indian Constellation (NavIC), and Japan’s Quazi-Zenith
Satellite System (QZSS). Unless explicitly stated, the specific navigation systems targeted
by the GNSS spoofing activities detailed in this report have not been confirmed. This
report’s investigations only detail activities that have affected civilian GNSS receivers.
Civilian systems are more vulnerable to interference activities like GNSS jamming and
spoofing than encrypted military GNSS receivers.
C4ADS used two distinct investigative methods to identify and map GNSS spoofing
activities in Russia and Syria: (1) spoofing detection through marine vessel Automatic
Identification System (AIS) path histories and (2) spoofing detection through a LEO
satellite GNSS receiver. Each method presents ways in which publicly and commercially
available data can be used to identify potential basing locations for devices used to
conduct denial-of-service GNSS spoofing activities. The methodologies detailed in this
report are highly replicable and scalable, and can be applied to other sources of GNSS
positioning data, such as fitness tracking applications and aircraft positioning signals.
Vessel Detection Methodology
In order to find instances of denial-of-service GNSS spoofing affecting maritime
navigation systems off the coast of the Russian Federation and Crimea, C4ADS, using
technology from a maritime risk analytics company, used GNSS positioning information
derived from maritime vessel AIS data consistent with known behaviors exhibited
by victim receivers. In this case, C4ADS identified vessels that reported positioning
information at civilian airports, mirroring public reports of GNSS spoofing in Russia.
C4ADS manually verified and cross-referenced these path histories with thise of other
vessels exhibiting similar patterns of behavior in order to help confirm that suspected
victim vessel path histories are not the result of malfunctioning AIS equipment.
5

Then, using Palantir Foundry, C4ADS conducted both trends analysis and targeted
investigations to identify where and when vessels fell victim to spoofing events.

After C4ADS identified vessels affected by GNSS spoofing activities, we conducted
investigations to determine actors present at each location at the time of the events.
C4ADS collected information from records and reporting in English, Russian, and
Ukrainian. Using line of sight analyses derived from the location information of ships
affected by the spoofing activity, we identified potential land-based GNSS spoofing
transmitter positions. We conducted further research on locations identified through
this analysis using official property ownership and transfer records, official corporate
records, and news and social media posts. Finally, we combined the above analysis
with information contained in notice to airmen (NOTAM) alerts and satellite imagery to
identify potential systems and motivations for this activity.

Transmitter Localization from Low-Earth Orbit Methodology
C4ADS, through close partnership with and technical expertise from researchers from
UT Austin, collected, analyzed, and geolocated denial-of-service spoofing signals using
a GPS receiver In low-Earth orbit (LEO) aboard the ISS.4 In total, we collected three
recordings on frequencies used by the GPS L1 and L2 frequency bands on three days
in the spring of 2018. Researchers at UT Austin analyzed the raw signal data and used
Doppler-based geolocation, illustrated below, to identify the origin point of the GPS
spoofing transmissions.

Once UT Austin researchers analyzed and geolocated the interference signals, C4ADS
used publicly available satellite imagery, official records, and imagery posted on social
media to identify potential electronic warfare (EW) assets in use at the source location
and their intended effects on target receivers.

This report is not designed to be an analysis of any country’s laws or regulations,
nor does it make conclusions about the intent or legality behind the GNSS spoofing
activities detailed herein. We seek instead to profile and expose a critical issue of public
interest. The mention of any individual, company, organization, or other entity in
this report does not imply the violation of any law or international agreement, and
should not be construed as such.
Technical Definitions
This report does not cover all existing forms of GNSS interference and thus, it relies on
the following definitions to delineate between different variants of interference:
●● GNSS Jamming, also referred to as brute force jamming, is when an attacker
generates noise-like signals at frequencies used by a GNSS system in order to
prevent GNSS receivers from tracking authentic signals. 5 6
●● Denial-of-Service GNSS Spoofing, sometimes referred to as ‘smart-jamming,’ is
when an attacker mimics authentic GNSS signals in order to hijack target GNSS
receiver tracking loops and feed false or even blank navigational information to
the vulnerable receiver. 7 In most cases, the effects of denial-of-service spoofing
are readily apparent to the user. Unless explicitly stated, references to ‘GNSS
spoofing’ in this report will refer only to denial-of-service spoofing attacks.
●● Deception GNSS Spoofing is when an attacker mimics authentic GNSS signals
in order to hijack target GNSS receiver tracking loops, feed false positioning or
timing information to the target receiver, and covertly misdirect the receiver
and its platform to some desired location. Successful attacks will deceive both
the target receiver and its user.8
Among GNSS interference experts, there are competing definitions on when spoofing
can be categorized as either deception or denial-of-service.9 For the purpose of this
paper we use the above definitions. However, for more information about alternate
definitions, see "Unmanned Aircraft Capture and Control via GPS Spoofing” by Kerns,
Shepard, Bhatti, and Humphreys.

GNSS Spoofing: Overview and Applications
In the summer of 2013, a research team
from The University of Texas at Austin (UT)
successfully hijacked the GPS navigation
systems
onboard
an
$80
million
superyacht using a $2,000 device the
size of a small briefcase. The experimental
attack forced the ship’s navigation systems
to relay false positioning information to
the vessel’s captain, who subsequently
made slight course corrections to keep
the ship seemingly on track. In reality, the
falsified signals generated by UT Austin’s device had successfully set the vessel offcourse by several degrees, all without tripping a single alarm on the ship’s navigational
alert systems. While this was a controlled experiment, a malicious actor could use the
same techniques to direct a vessel to stray into hostile waters.
The 2013 experiment demonstrated the use of one of the world’s first openly
acknowledged GNSS spoofing devices.10 At its core, GNSS spoofing is the deliberate
transmission of signals designed to emulate the authentic satellite systems that
underpin much of the world’s critical infrastructure. GNSS spoofing is distinct from
other forms of navigation interference such as GNSS jamming, which simply drowns
out satellite signals to prevent receivers from using them.i Instead, spoofed signals are
able to force vulnerable GNSS receivers, like those installed on the superyacht, to lose
their lock on authentic satellite signals and instead lock on to the signals generated
by the spoofing device.ii Once a receiver locks on to the spoofed signals, the spoofing
transmitter can relay false position or timing information to the victim receiver, thereby
“taking control.”iii UT Austin’s successful experiment served to expose just one of the
many systems vulnerable to GNSS spoofing attacks.
i
GNSS Jamming is the deliberate transmission of signals on frequencies used by GNSS in an effort to prevent
receivers from locking-on to authentic GNSS Signals. GNSS jamming requires relatively little technical knowledge and
can be conducted by simply drowning out authentic signals with random or disruptive noise. For more information,
see https://www.gps.gov/spectrum/jamming/

As previously mentioned, Denial-of-Service GNSS Spoofing, sometimes referred to as ‘smart-jamming’, is
when an attacker mimics authentic GNSS signals in order to hijack target GNSS receiver tracking loops and feed
false or even blank navigational information to the vulnerable receiver. In most cases, the effects of denial-ofservice spoofing are readily apparent to the user. Deception GNSS Spoofing, on the other hand, is when an attacker
mimics authentic GNSS signals in order to hijack target GNSS receiver tracking loops (through capture and drag-off
techniques), feed false positioning or timing information to the target receiver, and covertly misdirect the receiver
and its platform to some desired location. Successful attacks will deceive both the target receiver and its user. For

iii
In most public examples GNSS spoofing, the spoofing transmitter simulates false GNSS satellite ephemeris
and timing information which coerces the victim receiver to calculate incorrect positioning and, in some cases,
timing information.

The proven effectiveness of GNSS spoofing attacks on critical systems like maritime
navigation equipment is increasingly recognized by US and other governments. A 2012
National Risk Estimate conducted by the US Department of Homeland Security found
that “US critical infrastructure sectors are increasingly at risk from a growing dependency
on the Global Positioning System (GPS) for space-based position, navigation, and
timing (PNT).”11 The report concluded that GNSS spoofing attack scenarios in particular
presented the highest consequences to critical national infrastructure due to the
potential lapse of time between when the interference begins and when it is detected.12
A similar report commissioned by the United Kingdom Space Agency in 2017 asserted
that “all critical national infrastructure” in the UK relies on GNSS to some extent, and
that a five-day disruption to GNSS would result in an estimated £5.2 billion in economic
loss.13
GNSS is embedded in a wide range of basic day-to-day economic and transport
functions, but many civilian systems remain vulnerable. Attackers could use multiple
techniques to disrupt and even profit off of these potential vulnerabilities, as summarized

GNSS Spoofing Scenario

Despite these vulnerabilities, leaders in the public and private sectors have paid little
attention to the threat of GNSS spoofing. Until recently, this was for good reason.
Signal generators capable of conducting a spoofing attack cost of tens of thousands
of dollars and required expert knowledge to operate. But this all began to change
over the past decade with the advent of cheap, commercially available, and portable
“software defined radios” (SDR) and open-source code capable of transmitting spoofed
GPS signals. SDRs are used for a variety of innocuous applications including amateur
radio broadcast, aircraft tracking, and ship tracking. Today, these devices are capable
of mimicking authentic, multimillion-dollar GPS satellite signals and can be produced
for under $300—less than the price of a new television.iv Inexpensive systems have
already been used to hijack vehicle navigation systems,14 cheat at Pokémon GO,15 and
even “turn back time” on time-based authentication systems.16 According to some US
government officials, even drug cartels are beginning to use GNSS spoofing to mask
their activities and target smaller US drones.17
The Russian Federation is a pioneer in the use of these techniques to further its strategic
interests at home and abroad. In response to NATO’s advantage in C4ISRv capabilities,
Russia has prioritized the development of a comprehensive suite of asymmetrical EW
systems designed to deceive, degrade, and deny military and civilian GNSS receivers.18
19
In effect, Russian forces now have the capability to create large GNSS denial-ofservice spoofing environments, all without directly targeting a single GNSS satellite.
These systems are widely believed to be in use across Russia’s Western and Southern
Military Districts at the border with NATO and reportedly have been forward deployed
in conflict zones such as Ukraine20 and Syria.21

Increasing use of GNSS spoofing capabilities among the Russian military and security
services has caused spillover effects on civilian systems. Public reports from Moscow
began to surface in June 2016 claiming that mobile phone navigation systems often
reported false positioning information when in proximity to the Kremlin.22 23 After
similar activity was detected in Saint Petersburg, many were quick to hypothesize that
this interference was tied to counter-drone activities of the Russian Federal Protective
Service (FSO), the government entity charged with protecting Russia’s president.24 25
These hypotheses, however, remained unconfirmed. In June 2017, the captain of the
merchant vessel Atria provided direct evidence of GNSS spoofing activities off the
coast of Gelendzhik, Russia, when the vessel’s on-board navigation systems indicated
it was located in the middle of the Gelendzhik Airport, about 20km away.26 More than
two dozen other vessels reported similar disruptions in the region on that day.27 The US
Maritime Administration subsequently issued a GPS interference advisory for vessels
in the Black Sea, one of the first of its kind.28 Activity was reported on a larger scale
during military exercises, including Russia’s Zapad 2017 and NATO’s Trident Juncture
2018, when Norway and Finland reported severe GPS outages affecting commercial
airliners and cell phone networks for several days.29 30
To date, methods for detecting GNSS spoofing and other interference have been
reserved for organizations with the ability to leverage advanced means for signals
collection. As a result, the full scope of this activity has rarely been discussed in the
public domain. With the democratization of technological capabilities and access to
data, these advanced means are now available to a wider audience. This report serves
as one of the first systems-level demonstrations of how publicly available data can
be used to identify, detect, and expose the deployment of denial-of-service GNSS
spoofing capabilities. In doing so, we demonstrate how the use of GNSS spoofing in
the Russian Federation, its occupied territories, and its overseas military facilities is far
more pervasive and advanced than previously thought.

SPOOFING ACTIVITY ACROSS RUSSIA, CRIMEA, AND SYRIA
C4ADS found that GNSS spoofing activities in the Russian Federation, its occupied
territories, and its overseas military facilities are larger in scope, more geographically
diverse, and started earlier than any public reporting has suggested to date. Reports
by CNN31 and the RNT Foundation32 identify fewer than 450 vessels affected since late
2016.i Using Automatic Identification System (AIS) ship location data collected at scale,
C4ADS identified 9,883 instancesii of GNSS spoofing that affected 1,311 commercial
vessels beginning in February 2016.iii The disruptions appear to have originated from
ten or more locations in Russia and Russian-controlled areas in Crimea and Syria.

C4ADS needed a proxy that would display patterns of disruption associated with
spoofing. In principle, any device that relies on GNSS could be used to detect spoofing
activity. In Moscow, for example, where GNSS spoofing disruptions have been observed
near the Kremlin, public reporting has shown that location-based apps such as Uber
often report false positioning data, mistakenly calculating fares for locations thousands
of miles away. 33 It is also possible to detect this activity through other devices that
report GNSS positioning information.
Publicly available position heatmaps derived from fitness tracker applications, such as
Strava, can also be used to identify GNSS receiver path histories that exhibit unusual
patterns. 34 Data from Strava shows a pattern of individuals in central Moscow suddenly
i
Estimates of the number of victim vessels ranged from a few dozen to about 450. The first significant
reporting of GPS spoofing in Moscow surfaced around October 2016.
ii
C4ADS defined a spoofing ‘instance’ as every time we detected a vessel reporting a false position information
at a civilian airport.
iii
C4ADS examined AIS data between January 2013 and November 2018, but only detected spoofing activity
beginning in February 2016. Activities may have taken place prior to this time frame, but could not be included in our
sample set.

appearing at the Vnukovo and Sheremetyevo airport runways in Moscow. At normal
airports throughout Russia and the rest of Europe, device position paths typically
remain confined to aircraft taxiing paths and the terminal area, as seen below in the
heatmap of Moscow’s Domodedovo Airport, where activity is relatively normal. In
contrast, victim receivers potentially located in central Moscow appear to be spoofed to
discrete coordinates, which appear as hot spots on the Vnukovo Airport tarmac, about
20km outside Moscow. With the working assumption that the airport authorities do
not allow passengers to run in circles on an active runway, these positions are highly
suspect.

While Strava shows patterns of GNSS spoofing, AIS data present a more extensive,
reliable, and easily studied source of location data. We found that AIS data served as a
good proxy for identifying GNSS spoofing activity. GNSS spoofing activities that force
maritime vessels to report positioning information at nearby airports create an easily
recognizable and detectable pattern of activity where vessels that are clearly at sea
report their positions on land. By building datasets of all vessels that exhibited these
characteristics, C4ADS identified a number of additional vessels affected by GNSS
spoofing activities in the waters around the Russian Federation.
We found that across all instances of GNSS spoofing detected in Russia and Crimea,
receivers reported false positioning information at a local civilian airport, often dozens
of kilometers away. Our findings support previous public reports that the GNSS
spoofing activities detected in Russia are designed as a denial-of-service tool to activate
firmware-level geofence locks on commercial drones. These locks prevent drones from
flying in restricted airspace, such as the areas over airports. 35 If a commercial drone
locks on to the spoofed signals, they would either return to what they perceive as ‘nonrestricted’ airspace or land immediately. 36 Such a capability would have a wide range of
both offensive and defensive applications but is likely to be relatively indiscriminate in
nature, affecting both intended and unintended receivers in the vicinity.

Timeline of Detected Activity
GNSS spoofing in Russia and Crimea began long before public reporting on these
disruptions emerged. This activity can be detected off the coast of Gelendzhik in early
February 2016, more than a year before the June 2017 US Maritime Administration alert
on Black Sea activity. 37

In the timeline of spoofing events above, created from analysis in Palantir Foundry, we
can view several key trends in how these disruptions evolved between February 2016
and November 2018. When the activity first began in the spring of 2016, fewer than a
dozen vessels were affected. However, over the next year, these events increased rapidly
in both frequency and scope, possibly as these spoofing transmitters proliferated to
new locations and increased in strength. Following high-profile public exposure of
17

Above Us Only Stars
these events in several Russian and Western news outlets in June and July 2017, the
frequency of these events appeared to gradually decrease. 38 39
Through investigations into events at each location, we found that GNSS spoofing likely
began in 2016 in at least eight of the nine locations in Russia and Crimea where we
found evidence of spoofing. Spoofing events near Gelendzhik, Sochi, Saint Petersburg,
and Olyva were among the most frequent in the data analyzed; activity was detected
on 462 separate days between February 2016 and November 2018. Activity at these
locations took place on 46 percent of all days examined. In almost all cases where brief
GNSS spoofing events occurred in remote locations in Russia and Crimea, such as in
Arkhangelsk, Vladivostok, and Kerch, we found that spoofing events directly coincided
with visits by Russian president Vladimir Putin. In the case studies examined later in
this report, we hypothesize that the short-lived and isolated nature of these one-off
events suggests that at least some devices used to conduct this activity are mobile
and can be temporarily deployed at a location to create local areas of effect.
C4ADS also found evidence suggesting that multiple GNSS spoofing devices were in
use. Spoofed GNSS signals can generally only affect receivers that are within line of
sight of the spoofing device.40 Therefore, the range of these devices is typically limited
to the surrounding area. In our sample, there were 593 instances where vessels located
in areas too far for a single land-based transmitter to reach were affected within the
same hour. Additionally, it appears that the spoofing devices may not be constantly
active as vessels’ locations were not consistently spoofed. In the timeline and frequency
distribution graphs pictured above and the example shown below, spoofing activity
appears to ‘swap’ between two or more locations over time. When spoofing activity at
one location ends, it often resumes at a separate location shortly after, indicating that
this activity is coordinated to some degree.
Focusing on activity in the Black Sea between October 18 and 27 of 2016, vessel GNSS
receivers in proximity to both Gelendzhik and Sochi fell victim to spoofing events
within less than an hour of one another on multiple occasions. About half-way through

18

Above Us Only Stars
this period, the spoofing device located near Gelendzhik temporarily stopped directing
receivers to the Gelendzhik Airport and, instead, began to direct them to Vnukovo
Airport in Moscow, more than 1,000 kilometers away. As activity appeared to taper off
near Gelendzhik, activity in waters near the Crimean city of Olyva began. This pattern
of activity indicates that (1) at least two spoofing devices are in use in the Black Sea, (2)
these devices can be reprogrammed to spoof vessel receivers to multiple locations, and
(3) spoofing activity at certain locations is not constant, and may even shift between
locations over time.
Finally, through an analysis of the hourly distribution of activity, we can demonstrate
that spoofing events primarily take place during the day across all locations. In total,
90 percent of events took place between the hours of 6:00 and 22:00 local time. One
explanation for the apparent dip in activity between midnight and the early hours of
the morning could be that the spoofing devices are only turned on when the operators
are awake. A second potential explanation, examined later in this paper, is that the
spoofing transmitters are used to protect the movements of high-value individuals
during the day.

Geography of Detected Activity
The scope of GNSS spoofing events appears to be far more indiscriminate, persistent,
and widespread than previous public reporting suggests. In total, C4ADS found 9,883
GNSS spoofing instances affecting 1,311 vessels across ten locations in Russia, Crimea,
and Syria between February 2016 and November 2018. In addition to Moscow, Saint
Petersburg, Sochi, and Gelendzhik, where GNSS spoofing activity was already known,
C4ADS found evidence of newly discovered activities in Arkhangelsk in the Russian far
north, Vladivostok in the far east, the Kerch Strait near the frontline with Ukraine, and
Sevastopol and Olyva on the Crimean Peninsula. Finally, working with researchers from
UT Austin, we detected GNSS spoofing originating from Russia’s Khmeimim Airbase in
Syria on three separate occasions.

Scope of Detected Activity
Previous public reporting by the Resilient Navigation and Timing Foundation and CNN
suggests that only about 450 vessels fell victim to GNSS spoofing as of November
2018.41 However, C4ADS found that the total number of vessels spoofed during this
20

Above Us Only Stars
time may be closer to 1,311. Furthermore, we are able to demonstrate that events near
Gelendzhik, Sochi, and Saint Petersburg comprise over 94 percent of all detected
activity. However, this trend may be related to limitations associated with our use of
AIS as a proxy. Gelendzhik and Sochi, which experienced the most GNSS disruption
with 4,659 and 2,506 spoofing events, respectively, are both in close proximity to key
maritime transit and port facilities with a high density of GNSS receivers available to
detect the spoofed signals. Gelendzhik is located next to the Novorossiysk port, which
is one of the largest deep-water ports in Russia and home to a large contingent of the
Russian Black Sea Fleet42 43 while the Port of Sochi is a major destination and mooring
location for passenger and luxury vessels.44

In areas where there are fewer receivers to report irregular activity, spoofing may
be much harder to detect using publicly available information, and is therefore not
included in our dataset. However, based on the available data, we were able to observe
some key trends that have significant impacts on navigational safety.
Trend I: GNSS Receivers are Spoofed to Multiple Locations
While most affected locations in Russia and Crimea saw vessels spoofed to only one
nearby airport, vessels off the coast of Gelendzhik and Kerch were spoofed to two or
more airports sequentially between 2016 and 2018. AIS data throughout this period
indicate that vessels near Gelendzhik were spoofed to the Gelendzhik Airport, the
Sochi-Adler Airport, and the Vnukovo Airport in Moscow, as shown in the image on
21

Above Us Only Stars
the right. Additionally, vessels near Kerch
reported spoofed positioning information
at both the Simferopol Airport in Crimea
and the Anapa Airport on the other side of
the Kerch Strait.
This change in where vessels are spoofed
to is an indication that the GNSS spoofing
devices used in these regions can be
reprogrammed to force victim receivers to
different coordinates at will. By examining
the approximate positions to which victim
vessels had their positions spoofed, ‘hot
spots’ at each airport can be observed. An
example of ‘hot spots’ at Gelendzhik airport,
visualized through the spoofed position
frequency distribution below, indicates
that destination coordinates may vary
significantly across spoofing events over
time. This variation within the confines of
the airport could potentially be the result
of either manual coordinate selection by
the device operator or by victim receiver
calculation errors.

Trend II: Activity Takes Place Near Sensitive Government Airspace
C4ADS found a high correlation between GNSS spoofing events and the presence of
sensitive or prohibited airspace. In Russia and Crimea, we found at least 12 isolated and
ongoing GNSS disruptions. These instances appear to be localized in areas within close
proximity to the Russian head of state and Russian government facilities operated
by the FSO, as detailed below. In Syria, spoofing events took place in proximity to
Khmeimim Airbase, which is protected by advanced Russian military EW and antiaircraft equipment.45

Trend III: Activity is Indiscriminate to Ownership and International Boundaries
Even though spoofing events appear
to be localized to regions near
sensitive and prohibited airspace, our
research shows that these events are
indiscriminate in nature and appear to
affect vulnerable GNSS receivers in the
vicinity regardless of vessel nationality.
In fact, through an examination of
the top vessel flags affected by these
disruptions displayed in the chart
below, we found that Russia-flagged
ships were some of the most affected
vessels across almost all locations.
While C4ADS did not find evidence
confirming that GNSS spoofing at
any of the ten locations is used to
deliberately target specific receivers, it
is clear that across all locations these
24

Above Us Only Stars
disruptions may constitute a safety hazard for vessels and aircraft alike. We found that
GPS spoofing signals originating from Khmeimim Airbase in Syria, for example, would
be deafening for aircraft flying near the transmitter, subjecting them to spoofing signals
500 times stronger than authentic GPS signals.70 Similarly, based on the geographic
scope and nature of these GNSS spoofing events, at least some of these activities may
be in contravention of the United Nation’s International Telecommunications Union
(ITU) Radio Regulations Articles, which prohibit harmful radio frequency interference.iv
71
C4ADS detected at least 7,910 instances where victim vessels located outside of
Russian territorial waters fell victim to GNSS spoofing activity, potentially posing a risk
to maritime navigational safety. A majority of these instances, for example, took place
outside Russian territorial waters in the Black Sea, as seen in the image below.

These safety hazards are likely a spillover effect of actions taken in pursuit of Russian
national security objectives. In the following case studies, we will explore three
applications of GNSS spoofing and in each identify potential systems and basing
locations.

iv
According to Article 15 of the ITU’s Radio Regulation Articles, of which the Russian Federation is a party,
states agree to prohibit unrestricted signal transmissions that may interfere with safety systems.
●● Section 1: All stations are forbidden to carry out unnecessary transmissions, or the transmission of
superfluous signals, or the transmission of false or misleading signals, or the transmission of signals
without identification (except as provided for in Article 19).
●● Section 4: Special consideration shall be given to avoiding interference on distress and safety frequencies,
those related to distress and safety identified in Article 31 and those related to safety and regularity of
flight identified in Appendix 27.

PROTECTING VIPS
One of the clearest use cases for GNSS spoofing in the Russian Federation is for the
protection of very important persons (VIP). C4ADS uncovered cases where GNSS
spoofing in certain geographically isolated locations took place only in correlation with
Russian leadership movements and FSO security activities. The purpose of this spoofing
activity was likely to prevent unauthorized civilian drone activity as a VIP protection
measure.i Because many of these activities took place over brief time periods in isolated
locations, they support the working hypothesis that at least some of the devices used
to conduct GNSS disruptions are mobile and can be temporarily deployed to create
local areas of effect.
The Kerch Bridge Visit
The Kerch Bridge was built after the Russian annexation of Crimea to link the Crimean
Peninsula to mainland Russia. The Kerch Strait, where the bridge is situated, has become
a point of contention between Russia and Ukraine over the past several years, with
Russia detaining three Ukrainian military vessels in November 2018 over accusations
that the vessels had strayed into Russian territorial waters.72 C4ADS identified GNSS
spoofing activities in proximity to the Kerch Bridge on only two occasions – on
September 15, 2016 and May 15, 2018. On both days, Russian President Vladimir Putin
was present in the area to oversee the progress and completion of the Kerch Bridge.
Vehicles suspected to belong to the Russian FSO could be seen following the Russian
president during both events.
September 15, 2016
On September 15, 2016, the Russian President and Prime Minister made a single-day
trip to Kerch to examine progress on the Kerch Bridge.73 That same day, vessels moored
at the nearby Kerch Port reported false positioning information at the Simferopol

i
As previously mentioned, GNSS spoofing events detected in Russia are likely designed to deceive GNSS
receivers on commercial drones to activate firmware-level geofence locks that prevent these drones from flying in
restricted airspace such as an airport. If one of these commercial drones locks on to the spoofed signals, they would
either return to what they perceive as ‘non-restricted’ airspace or disengage entirely before they reach the restricted
airspace.

Airport nearly 200km away in Crimea. This event was the first GNSS spoofing event
detected near Kerch, and the only one detected in 2016. According to official news
releases posted on the Kremlin’s website, the September 15 trip was the first and only
official Presidential visit to Kerch in 2016.74
May 15, 2018
Less than two years later, President Putin returned to Kerch to take part in the
official opening of the Kerch Bridge.75 To celebrate the opening, Putin led a convoy of
construction vehicles across the bridge from Russia to Crimea.76 AIS records for vessels
in the Kerch Strait at the time show that vessel passage through the straight was
heavily restricted at the time of the event. It is during this time that at least 24 vessels
anchored in waters in proximity to the bridge reported spoofed GNSS positioning
information at the Anapa Airport more than 65km away. This was the only sustained
spoofing disruption evidenced by AIS records in Kerch in 2018. Official news releases
from the Kremlin indicate that the May 15 event was the only official Presidential visit
to Kerch in 2018.77

On the same day as the May 2018 GNSS disruptions, vehicles suspected to belong
to the FSO drove alongside Putin’s construction truck motorcade as it made its way
across the Kerch Bridge. Using a line of sight analysis to estimate the potential range of
a GNSS spoofing device, we can show that a spoofing transmitter based on one of the
FSO vehicles at the Kerch bridge would likely be capable of targeting all vessels that
reported spoofed location information on May 15, 2018.ii
ii
Due to the physical limitations of ultra-high frequency GNSS signals, spoofed signals would generally be
unable to pass through physical obstructions such as mountains. To determine visibility from the Kerch bridge,
C4ADS used ArcGIS to process a 3D terrain maps of the area surrounding the bridge and calculated what would be
in view of a transmitter positioned on the bridge.

The Zvezda Shipyard Visit
The Zvezda Shipyard is located near the remote Russian Far East town of Bolshoy
Kamen, 30km away from the port city of Vladivostok. For the past two years in early
September, vessel GNSS receivers stationed at the shipyard have reported false location
information at the Vladivostok International Airport. As in Crimea, these disruptions
coincide directly with visits made by the Russian President to the shipyard, in this case
for the Eastern Economic Forum hosted in Vladivostok in 2017 and 2018.
September 8, 2017
On his last day in Vladivostok for the 2017 Eastern
Economic Forum, President Putin visited Bolshoy
Kamen to inspect the newly constructed Zvezda
Shipyard. The official Kremlin website reported the
visit and the Russian President’s speech at 1:30pm
local time.78 At approximately 1:24pm local time, the
only vessel moored at the shipyard reported spoofed
positioning information at the Vladivostok International Putin's Speach at Zvezda Shipyard
Airport. This is the first and only detected instance of
GNSS spoofing near Bolshoy Kamen in 2017.
September 11, 2018
Approximately one year after the first
spoofing event detected at Zvezda
Shipyard, Putin returned to the facility
to oversee the implementation of
the shipyard’s production projects.79
Once again, at least one vessel-based
GNSS receiver located at the shipyard
reported false positioning information
at the Vladivostok Airport at the time
of the president’s afternoon visit.
The temporary and isolated nature of
the GNSS spoofing detected near the
Kerch Bridge and Zvezda Shipyard
strongly suggests that the equipment
used to create these disruptions could
be based on a mobile platform, and
that it is capable of creating localized
zones of spoofing.

28

Above Us Only Stars
Potential Systems in Use (Mobile)
Based on the pattern of spoofing activity outlined above, it is reasonable to assume that
the FSO likely possesses EW systems capable of producing the type of interference
seen in our investigation. In 2016, an unnamed official who claimed to have direct
knowledge of EW systems used by the FSO near the Kremlin told the Russian outlet
Vedomosti that the FSO was likely using the “Shipovnik-Aero or some close analog
to it.”80 According to official documentation and the information sheet shown in the
image on the right, the Shipovnik-Aero is a military-grade EW system based on a
Kamaz vehicle frame that can be used to suppress unmanned aerial vehicle systems
by creating a false navigation field, thereby forcing drones to land.81 82 However, a
representative from the United Instrument-Making Corporation (UIMC), the company
that produces the Shipovnik-Aero, denied that the system is in use by the special
services at the Kremlin.83 84
Based on our analysis of the use of GNSS
spoofing for VIP protection, we believe that the
GNSS spoofing device (or devices) used in Kerch
and Vladivostok are likely mobile, able to be
turned on and off to create local areas of effect,
and are potentially operated by the FSO.
Using these specifications and the leads
generated by Vedomosti in 2016 as guidance,
C4ADS examined over a thousand contracts in the
official Russian government contracts registry
in search of equipment purchases potentially
related to GNSS spoofing infrastructure.85 In line
with UIMC’s official stance that it did not supply
Shipovnik-Aero systems to the FSO, C4ADS did
not find any public contracts between UIMC
and the FSO.
However, C4ADS did locate numerous FSO procurement contracts and repair
agreements for several mobile electronic countermeasure systems, including the
“Shipovnik-4800M” and the “Shipovnik-M.” These systems are produced not by UIMC,
but rather by a joint stock company based in the town of Vladimir named JSC Design
Skilled Office of Radio Equipment (JSC KOBRA).86 87
According to a June 2009 issue of Mayak, a trade publication, JSC KOBRA was at one
time the sole supplier of equipment used for radio-control and monitoring near the
Kremlin and the Russian White House.88 In its online catalogue, JSC KOBRA offers
several electronic countermeasure systems, including ones designed to neutralize
commercial drones by counteracting the communication channels of GLONASS, GPS,
GALILEO, and COMPASS.89
No references to either the Shipovnik-4800M or the Shipovnik-M could be found in
public media sources or on JSC KOBRA’s website. The 2009 issue of Mayak references
both the Shipovnik-95 and the Shipovnik-98 as systems supplied to the FSO by JSC
29

Above Us Only Stars
KOBRA for radio signal suppression.90 The article also claimed that the FSO has
deployed the Shipovnik-95 on Russian presidential escort vehicles.91 92
Official government records, shown below, indicate that in August 2014 the Arms
Administration of the Engineering and Technical Support Service of the FSO with a
listed address at the Kremlin purchased five Shipovnik-4800M portable electronic
countermeasure complexes for about $120,400 each.93 94 95

In October 2015, the Caucasus branch of the FSO, based in Sochi and responsible for
security activities at government residences on the Black Sea coast, finalized a contract
with JSC KOBRA for the repair of a “mobile radio-electronic countermeasure complex”
named the Shipovnik-M.96

The specifications and potential capabilities of both the Shipovnik-4800M and
Shipovnik-M could not be identified through official records. Records from the Russian
Federal Accreditation Service, responsible for issuing regulatory certifications for
equipment, describe the Shipovnik-4800M as “portable electronic countermeasure
equipment” that is able to operate on battery power.97 98
The FSO procured several mobile EW devices for its branches in Moscow and Sochi,
which appear to belong to a family of systems used for presidential motorcade
protection. While we cannot say for certain that these mobile systems are behind the
isolated spoofing activity detected near the Russian president, learning more about
them gives us a better understanding of potential systems in play.

DEFENDING STRATEGIC FACILITIES
In addition to the protection of Russian leaders, C4ADS found evidence that GNSS
spoofing is used to protect strategic Russian government residences and other highlysensitive facilities near the Black Sea and in Moscow. Unlike the spoofing activity
associated with VIP visits to remote locations, the activity seen in the vicinity of static
government facilities is more frequent, affects a greater number of vessels, and appears
to interfere with receivers over a greater distance.
Official Russian Government Facilities
C4ADS observed patterns of GNSS spoofing around official Russian buildings in both
Moscow and on the Russian Black Sea coast. In Sochi and Olyva, GNSS spoofing
interfered with vessel navigation systems off the coast of official government
residences owned and operated by the FSO. Similarly, potential spoofing activity
occurred near the Kremlin and the Presidential Residence in Moscow. These facilities
are publicly acknowledged as belonging to the Russian government and are afforded
special airspace protections reserved for strategic government and military facilities. In
all cases, GNSS spoofing disruptions beginning in 2016 forced victim receivers to report
positions at local civilian airports. These events have continued to affect receivers as of
the time of this report’s publication.

31

Black Sea Residences
Aeronavigation charts dated July 2017 and August 2018 from the Russian Center of
Aeronavigation Information show that the airspaces above two facilities in Sochi and
a large swath of the southern coast of Crimea near Olyva are classified as prohibited.99
100
Prohibited is the strictest classification for airspace in the Russian Federation and is
typically used for airspace over highly sensitive government and military installations.101
In Sochi, the Russian presidential and prime ministerial residences of Bocharov Ruchey
and Riviera-6, respectively, are located in the center of two prohibited airspaces.
Similarly, the prohibited airspace along the southern coast of Crimea is situated above
a string of coastal residences that are now occupied by the Russian government.102

The Bocharov Ruchey and Riviera-6 residences in Sochi are widely reported to be
overseen by the Caucasus branch of the FSO, which is responsible for the protection
of all government residences in the south of the country.103 104 Similarly, in December
2016, following the Russian annexation of the Crimean Peninsula, Crimean authorities
transferred control of five government residences located in Foros and Olyva to the
Crimean branch of the Russian FSO.105

32

Above Us Only Stars

According to Crimean news and social media reports, significant FSO security
activities began at the government dachas and residences around March 2016, several
months before the first detection of GNSS spoofing in the region.106 In addition to FSO
checkpoints and brick walls now surrounding the complexes, images of large security
fences bordering the highway to the north have emerged on social media accounts.107

Potential Systems in Use (Stationary)
Due to heightened security around the Black Sea dachas and residences, C4ADS was
unable to collect data on the systems potentially in use at these facilities. However, the
area around the Kremlin in central Moscow is more prone to analysis using public data.
Already, Russian researchers have recorded possible spoofing activity near the Kremlin.
In October 2016, a researcher driving around central Moscow on a Segway reportedly
used a collection of receivers to detect GPS and GLONASS interference signals near
the Kremlin.109 Similarly, in September 2017, a researcher searching for the source of
Moscow’s GPS spoofing found that the spoofed signals likely originate from a position
outside, rather than inside, the Kremlin.110
Suspected Kremlin Counter-Drone Systems
Based on leads generated by Russian journalists and hobbyists searching for the source
of Moscow’s GNSS spoofing,111 112 C4ADS identified possible GNSS spoofing equipment
based on at least three buildings in central Moscow. All three buildings host what appear
to be identical antennas and transmission equipment on their rooftops. According
to publicly available imagery, the antennas appear to face the Kremlin. Two of the
buildings are openly owned by the Russian government, the third inexplicably lacks
official ownership information in local property records.113 The equipment at all three
locations first appeared between June 2015 and September 2016 on street mapping
websites, or within the time frame that GNSS spoofing activity was first reported near
the Kremlin.114

34

Above Us Only Stars
Based on a review of the images of the equipment by individuals with electronic warfare
experience and familiarity with electronic warfare systems, the equipment located at
all three locations appears to include an 11-element direction-finding antenna array
likely able to operate on ultra-high frequency (UHF) bands.115 This would include the
GPS L1, L2, and L5 bands, as well as bands used by many civilian drone controllers.116 117
It is also possible that the direction-finding antennas are designed to geolocate civilian
drone control systems operating at locations close to the Kremlin. Alternatively, the
direction-finding antennas could be used to direct GNSS spoofing signals in a desired
direction. The equipment may also include a small cylindrical microwave antenna,
which could potentially be used to create a cone of GNSS spoofing or jamming signals
in the direction it is facing.118 119

transmitter(s) in Moscow conduct GPS jamming on the L2 and L5

direction-finding antenna array can spoofed. This effective method of spoofing is well-known among
be seen. Sometime between June navigation warfare experts. (Source: http://addmeto.cc/828.html)
and December 2017, it appears that
the mast used for the array increased in height.120 This height increase may have been
an effort to enhance the effectiveness of the direction-finding antenna array in locating
the source of ground-based signal transmissions, such as those used by civilian drone
controllers.

In June 2018, photographs of the direction-finding antennas showed additional changes
implemented sometime between January and June 2018. These changes appear to
35

Above Us Only Stars
include a switch from a standard dipole element to a more broadband-type antenna
such as a Vivaldi element, which would allow for a wider range of frequencies to be
potentially monitored and located.i 121

Unidentified Building with Counter Drone Equipment
Of the three buildings that C4ADS identified in Moscow hosting possible counterdrone systems, at least two are directly associated with the Russian Government, as
evidenced in official Russian property records from August 2018.122 The third, located
at D 4-10 Ipatyevskiy Lane, Building 1, has no associated ownership information listed
in official government databases. However, this building hosts an antenna array that
appears identical to the equipment seen at the government-owned facilities elsewhere
in Moscow. Based on a review of publicly available imagery on sites such as Yandex
and Google Street View, the equipment appears to have been deployed sometime
between 2015 and September 2016. Like the other two buildings, the equipment at
Ipatyevskiy Lane faces the Kremlin.
Official documentation from the Russian Land Registry for D 4-10 Ipatyevskiy Lane,
Building 1, indicates that the ownership information has either been censored, removed,
or never recorded in the official registry, although the available records show that the
property was assigned a cadastral number on May 22, 2012.123 While property records
do not provide ownership information for the complex, street view imagery from 2013,

At this time, updated 2018 Yandex Street view imagery of the direction-finding antenna positioned at 4-10

before the road was shut to the public, shows at least 10 vehicles with serialized license
plate numbers ending in OO77 parked outside the building.124 125 According to several
publicly available Russian DMV databases reviewed by C4ADS, this serialization pattern
has been previously associated with vehicles belonging to the Office of the President
of the Russian Federation.126

Unofficial Government Facilities
In contrast to areas where an official government presence made the placement of a
GNSS spoofing device a logical protective measure, spoofing activity off the coast off
Gelendzhik did not appear to have an obvious explanation. The coast near Gelendzhik
does not have any declared government residences. Despite this, spoofing events off
the Gelendzhik coast were the most frequent in our sample. We wanted to find the
likely source of this activity, and so we turned to local media reports and an abundance
of spoofed vessel position data to narrow our search.
Gelendzhik is frequented by security service officials, which is in line with popular but
unconfirmed reports that President Vladimir Putin maintains a private residence in
the outskirts of the town.127 128 129 Following an examination of several hypotheses, we
believe that the GNSS spoofing system in use near Gelendzhik is land-based.130 Given
the frequent nature of GNSS spoofing activity near Gelendzhik and its wide-reaching
effects on vessels in the area, we posited that the device has access to a reliable and
sustained source of electricity.
Aggregated Line of Sight Analysis
To trace back to high-probability basing locations for spoofing devices in use near
Gelendzhik, C4ADS conducted an aggregated line of sight analysis. Due to the physical
limitations of ultra-high frequency GNSS signals, spoofed signals would generally
be unable to pass through physical obstructions such as mountains.131 To determine
37

Above Us Only Stars
visibility from a given location, C4ADS used ArcGIS to process 3D terrain maps of the
area around Gelendzhik. Using AIS positioning data from 1,920 spoofing instances,
we calculated the areas along the coastline that would be able to “see” all or nearly
all of the vessels in our dataset. Based on these line of sight calculations for affected
vessel receiver positions, we were able to narrow down potential basing areas to just
a few land-based locations. The results indicated that only one facility located at Cape
Idokopas appeared to have line of sight with more than 98% of the affected vesselbased receivers.

Cape Idokopas Residence
Cape Idokopas, located about 20km to the southeast of Gelendzhik, Russia, appears
to be the most likely location for a terrestrial GNSS spoofing transmitter. The analysis
indicates that it is located in proximity to several positions that have line of sight
with at least 98 percent of affected vessels off the coast of Gelendzhik. The Cape is
home to a sprawling facility containing a large Italianate palace, several helicopter
pads, an amphitheater, and a small port. The complex was the subject of extensive
international investigative reporting that alleged the property was built at the direction
of then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin under the auspices of an investment scheme
referred to as “Project South,” allegedly for use as his private dacha.132 133 134 The Russian
government continues to deny that President Putin has any involvement with the
38

Above Us Only Stars
facility.135 136 Regardless, high profile allegations of corruption have long dogged the
project. Investigative reporting by Reuters in 2014 indicated that funds from a $1 billion
program ordered by then-President Putin in 2005 to improve Russian healthcare were
used to finance the construction of the facility.137

Aeronavigation charts dated July 2017 from the Russian Center of Aeronavigation
Information show that the airspace above the Idokopas facility is classified as
Prohibited.138 139 The facility maintains the same level of flight restriction that exists
over the presidential and prime ministerial residences in Sochi.140 However, unlike the
official government residences and protected military facilities in Russia and Crimea,
the prohibited airspace over Cape Idokopas appears to only protect a private residence.
As discussed below, extensive property and corporate records along with previous
investigative reporting outlined below suggest that the facility has an opaque history
of involvement with elements of the FSO and Federal Security Service (FSB).141
For example, facility construction activities appear to have some associations with the
FSO. In 2017, a newly constructed port appeared to the south of the Cape Idokopas palace.
AIS records and satellite imagery indicate that a vessel called the Chernomorets-35
was present during, and may have assisted in, the development of the port.142 Official
records from the Russian contract registry show that 70 percent of the ship owner’s
contracts were with elements of the Russian state security services including the FSO,
FSB, and the Presidential Administration.143 This is supported by AIS records for the
Chernomorets-35, which suggest that the vessel is one of a relatively small number
permitted to operate at the FSO-operated government residences at Bocharov Ruchey,
Riviera-6, and Olyva.144 In fact, the majority of areas visited by Chernomorets-35 appear
to be officially owned or operated by elements of the FSO.145

39

The Chernomorets-35 is the only vessel that fell victim to GNSS spoofing in proximity to
Sochi, Gelendzhik, and Olyva while reportedly conducting construction activities at the
government and private residences located nearby. The vessel’s close position to the
coast and proximity to sensitive facilities when it was affected by spoofed signals are
additional indications that the spoofing devices may be positioned near the facilities
themselves.

Idokopas Palace Ownership
C4ADS conducted an extensive property and corporate records analysis of the Cape
Idokopas residence, matching it with previous investigative reporting. We found an
opaque history of involvement with elements of the FSO and FSB.
According to official property records from the Russian cadastral registry last accessed
by C4ADS in July 2018, the Gelendzhik-based company Kompleks LLC146 is the sole
owner of the Idokopas facility.147 These same records indicated that Kompleks LLC
became the owner of the facility on or before May 27, 2013. Official property records
also show that the road and land bordering the main entrance to the facility is owned
by the FSB’s Border Directorate.148 These records indicate that the FSB acquired the
land on May 19, 2008.149 It is currently unknown whether the FSB maintains an active
presence at the facility. On at least one occasion in February 2011, environmentalists
from the Russian organization Ecological Watch visiting the Cape Idokopas palace were
confronted by facility security. This incident involved guards allegedly belonging to the
border force, as well as an officer bearing patches and epaulets resembling those of a
Senior Lieutenant in the FSO.150 151

Historical ownership records for Kompleks LLC appear to show that at the time of
the property’s purchase in May 2013, 100 percent of Kompleks LLC’s shares belonged
to Moscow-based Investstroy LLC.152 153 154 According to Russian corporate records, at
the time that Kompleks LLC purchased the property, two Russian individuals named

41

Tatyana Arnoldovna Kuznetsova and Inna Yuryevna Kolpakova were the sole equal
shareholders of Investstroy LLC.155 According to reporting from several Russian news
agencies, both Tatyana Kuznetsova and Inna Kolpakova are married to former highranking officers in the FSO.156 157 158
Tatyana Kuznetsova is reportedly the wife of Oleg Sergeyevich Kuznetsov, who is
reported to have previously served as the head of Military Unit 1473 of the FSO.159 160
Unit 1473, based in Moscow, is responsible for the management and operation of real
estate belonging to the Russian state security services.161 Inna Kolpakova is reportedly
the wife of Alexandr Sergeyevich Koplakov who reportedly formerly served as the
head of Directorate ‘V’ of the FSO Presidential Security Service until 2013.162 163 The FSO
Presidential Security Service is directly tasked with protecting the Russian Head of
State.164
A contract signed pursuant to a 2005 investment agreement, published by the Russian
newspaper Novaya Gazeta, indicates that Oleg Kuznetsov and Unit 1473 maintained
involvement in the initial stages of development of the Cape Idokopas facility.165 166 167
These same documents also appear to show the involvement of Vladimir Kozhin in
the development of the property at the same time that he was working as an aide to
the Russian president.168 The US Department of the Treasury sanctioned Kozhin under
Executive Order 13661 in 2014 in response to the Russian annexation of Crimea.169 In an
April 2011 interview with Kommersant, Kozhin confirmed his involvement in the initial
stages of the property’s development, but claimed that it was only to encourage real
estate development among investors.170

Novaya Gazeta reported that, in 2010, a Russian whistleblower who claimed to have
been involved in the financing of the Cape Idokopas palace, alleged that construction

42

of the Palace was personally directed by Nikolai Shamolov at the behest of then-Prime
Minister Putin.171 Shamolov, widely reported to be a close associate of Putin, has been
sanctioned by the European Union since 2014.172
Prior to December 2016, the ultimate beneficial owner of Kompleks LLC and the Cape
Idokopas residence remained hidden behind layers of holding companies based
in secrecy jurisdictions, primarily in the British Virgin Islands.173 In December 2016, a
change in the shareholding structure revealed that the only natural person to own
shares in Kompleks LLC, is Alexandr Anatolyevich Ponomarenko.174 Ponomarenko is a
high-profile Russian billionaire and apparent former owner of the nearby Novorossiysk
Port.175 176 It is unclear when exactly Ponomarenko acquired the Idokopas facility,
although he claims to have purchased the property from Nikolai Shamalov as early as
March 2011.177 178

MILITARY PROTECTION ABROAD
While much of the previous reporting on GNSS spoofing has focused on where these
activities appear within Russia, less attention has been paid to how these capabilities
may be integrated into expeditionary force protection abroad. Using publicly available
satellite data, we were able to uncover evidence that systems used to spoof GNSS
signals are also being deployed on the ground in Syria. This work builds on previous
public reporting on GPS interference activity reported in the Eastern Mediterranean,179
Syria,180 181 Norway,182 and Finland.183
From Jamming to Spoofing in Syria
Syria is a testbed for a range of Russian military equipment, including new EW assets.
In April 2018, the head of US SOCOM Gen. Tony Thomas referred to Syria as, “the most
aggressive electronic warfare environment in the world.”184 By some reports, GPS
interference activities in Syria have been on the cutting edge, and Russia’s deployment
of EW capabilities has successfully targeted smaller US military drones.185
C4ADS and UT Austin used a GPS receiver onboard the International Space Station
(ISS) to record, characterize, and ultimately geolocate a denial-of-service GPS spoofing
transmitter to the Khmeimim Airbase in Syria. The research began in March 2018 when
researchers from UT Austin detected evidence of GPS interference when examining
historical GPS signal recordings collected from the ISS. In an effort to further characterize
the GPS interference, C4ADS and UT Austin collaborated to conduct three independent
GPS signal recordings over several months in the spring of 2018. On all three days of
collection, researchers from UT Austin found clear evidence of GPS spoofing in the
recorded signal data. Moreover, UT Austin researchers successfully geolocated the
source of the signals in all three samples to Khmeimim Airbase, the nerve center of the
Russian military campaign in Syria.

44

Above Us Only Stars
Based on an analysis of the Doppler signatures in the tracked data, we assess that
the interference signals captured on all three days were likely generated by the same
transmitter. This analysis has broader implications, specifically on how emerging civilian
capabilities, such as cheap LEO satellites, combined with technical expertise, can be
used to identify and track disruptions to GNSS worldwide.

UT Austin researchers found that while the signals successfully mimicked authentic
GPS satellites, they carried no valid navigation information. In essence, GPS receivers
targeted by these spoofed signals would report live GPS satellite connections but
would be unable to calculate any valid positioning or timing information, which
would effectively render the receivers inoperable. Furthermore, UT Austin researchers
determined that the spoofing signals would be upwards of 500 times stronger
than authentic GNSS signals for aircraft flying within line of sight of the transmitter,
presenting a direct safety threat to commercial aviation in range of the transmissions.
Because denial-of-service spoofing would prevent receivers from calculating any
navigation information, this activity may appear to be jamming, which has been
widely reported in the Eastern Mediterranean in recent years. In late 2018, for example,
Eurocontrol reported GNSS jamming activity originating from Syrian territory and
identified high probability locations in the Eastern Mediterranean from which the
interference appeared to originate.186 187

45

Above Us Only Stars

This interference, however, may well be the product of spoofing, and not just jamming.
GPS interference reports posted on the US Coast Guard Navigation Center’s website
from ships based in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, for example, mirror the pattern
of activity that would be expected of a receiver affected by the spoofed GPS signals
detected at Khmeimim. In these reports, several vessel GPS receivers in proximity to
one another reported satellite signal locks but could not calculate any valid positioning
information.

In the context of these reports, C4ADS and UT Austin’s findings bring to light the
possibility that at least some of the GPS interference taking place in Syria and the
Eastern Mediterranean may, in fact, be denial-of-service GPS spoofing.

Potential Systems in Use (Military)
Khmeimim Airbase, where the spoofed GPS signals appear to originate, serves as
one of the primary staging locations for Russian military sorties in Syria. Since 2013,
Kheimim has undergone heavy reconstruction and now supports and protects the
most advanced Russian military assets deployed in Syria. According to a series of
agreements signed between Russia and Syria in 2016 and 2017, Russian forces maintain
full authority over air defense and rule of law within the territory of the facility.188 189 The
airbase houses Russia’s latest military assets, including S-400 surface-to-air missile
batteries, the Pantsir-S1 anti-aircraft system, and Su-57 stealth fighters.190 While the
Russian military regularly displays these systems publicly on Russian media outlets,
EW systems deployed at the airbase have generally avoided the limelight.191 Many
videos allegedly revealing the basing location for these systems are no longer online.192

47

Above Us Only Stars
Khmeimim has been a target of air attacks in the past. On January 5, 2018, a drone
swarm consisting of 13 drones carrying explosive fragmentation munitions reportedly
attacked from the east.193 The drones, reportedly all launched from the same location
about 96km from Khmeimim, came pre-programmed with flight path coordinates,
suggesting that the drones likely used GNSS for navigation assistance.194 According to
the Russian Ministry of Defense, Russian EW systems based at Khmeimim forced at
least six of the drones to land at “assigned coordinates” while Pantsir S1 anti-aircraft
systems neutralized the remaining seven drones.195 Based on this official description,
it is possible that Russian EW systems targeted GNSS receivers onboard the drones in
order to force them to land.
Commercial drones deployed by non-state combatants in warzones like Syria often
have their geofencing restrictions removed to bypass flight restrictions over much
of Syria and Iraq.196 This means that GNSS spoofing designed to trigger typical drone
geofence locks, as seen in Russia, cannot be used to disable these modified drones.
Drones are now used consistently by combatants for reconnaissance purposes and to
deliver low-yield payloads to protected targets such as ammo depots and airports.197 In
a militarized environment where geofences are not an effective tool, Russia has to rely
on more other methods such as this unique form of denial of service spoofing to target
and bring down homemade drones.
The Russian Ministry of Defense has not detailed the specific EW systems deployed
in Syria, but at least two systems potentially capable of performing counter-drone
missions by targeting GNSS are now confirmed or likely to be present in Syria.

In 2015 and 2017, videos posted by several Russian news outlets appeared to corroborate
satellite imagery analysis by IHS showing the deployment of the Krasukha-4 EW system
at the northern portion of the Khmeimim Airfield.207 208 209 There are many conflicting
reports about the full breadth of the Krasukha-4’s EW capabilities, with some sources
claiming that the system is capable of “blocking GPS” in addition to radar systems over
a large area.210 211 Satellite imagery from dates closest to the days where C4ADS and UT
48

Austin detected GPS interference shows a known Krasukha-4 basing location located
within roughly 350 meters from the estimated signal origin.212 It is currently unknown
whether this system is responsible for the GPS interference signals detected coming
from the facility.

R-330Zh Zhitel
In addition to the Krasukha-4, the advanced Russian R-330Zh Zhitel EW system is also
reportedly present in Syria. A video of Aleppo Airport posted around December 2016
show what appears to be a towable phased antenna array assembly belonging to the
R-330Zh.213 As opposed to the Krasukha-4, the R-330Zh’s ability to jam and manipulate
GPS systems is officially recognized by the Russian government.214 C4ADS conducted
an analysis of satellite imagery available for Khmeimim Airbase for dates near when
we detected GPS spoofing. However, C4ADS could not confirm, with confidence, the
presence of the R-330Zh at the Khmeimim Airbase due to limitations in the resolution
of the imagery.

Unknown Hangars
In June 2017 and February 2018, two closed-off elliptic hangar-like structures, reportedly
used to house delicate equipment including UAV components and other sensors,
appeared within the high-probability transmitter basing area identified by UT Austin
researchers.215 According to the researchers’ estimates, these hangars are located
within the 99 percent probability basing area.

Based on available imagery, it is believed that the hangar constructed in June 2017
is not directly connected to the tarmac and would therefore be an unlikely basing
location for aircraft. Additionally, the hangar appears to include an elevated arm that
could potentially be used to mask an antenna. The hangars themselves appear to be
designed to prevent satellites or individuals stationed at the facility from photographing
the hardware positioned inside the hangars. It is currently unconfirmed whether these
structures are directly tied to the detected GPS spoofing activities.

CONCLUSION
Through C4ADS’ investigation into GNSS spoofing activities taking place in the Russian
Federation, Crimea, and Syria, we are able to demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging
publicly available signals, official records, social and news media, and technology to develop
an enhanced awareness of the potential actors, systems, and locations used to conduct these
activities. The systems-level analyses and case studies detailed in this report expose just a
fraction of the GNSS interference activities taking place worldwide. However, our research
indicates that Russia continues to act as a pioneer in this space, exposing its willingness to
not only deploy these capabilities in protection of VIPs and strategically-important facilities,
but also to leverage these techniques to promote its ventures at frontiers in Syria and Russia’s
European borders. Russia’s continued development and deployment of systems designed
to spoof GNSS and counteract NATO’s decisive advantage in C4ISR capabilities at forwardoperating locations in Syria and Kaliningrad presents a unique challenge to the security of
critical national infrastructure.
While the GNSS spoofing activities against civilian GNSS systems detailed in this report
identify capabilities used by state-level actors, the tools and methodologies for conducting
similar activities are readily available to non-state actors. State and non-state actors engaged
in illicit activity continue to show the lengths to which they are willing to go in order to both
conduct and conceal their operations. 216 While the commercial availability and concealability
of these do-it-yourself devices present a unique set of challenges for deterring both lone-wolf
and coordinated spoofing activities, state-sponsored activities against civilian GNSS receivers
continue to show how impactful these activities can be against vulnerable systems. Whether
for profit, protection, or disruption, illicit actors, writ large, stand to gain from the proliferation
of these capabilities.
The tools used to conduct this activity may be openly available, but so too are the technologies
and methodologies for detecting, tracking, and geolocating these activities. This report aims
to demonstrate the utility of combining subject matter expertise, like that from the University
of Texas at Austin, with data-driven analysis to develop unique approaches for collecting,
analyzing, and ultimately addressing GNSS spoofing activities. The techniques for finding
GNSS spoofing detailed in this report are both replicable and highly extensible. Any system that
reports GNSS-derived location information, like aircraft or mobile devices, can potentially be
exploited to identify GNSS spoofing events affecting aircraft or ground-based GNSS receivers.
Moreover, the collaboration between C4ADS and UT Austin researchers shows how GNSS
receivers based on low-Earth-orbit satellites can be used to detect and geolocate interference
signals worldwide. As private satellite firms continue to launch small and relatively inexpensive
payloads into low-Earth-orbit, the commercial availability of GNSS receiver data that can be
used to detect this interference will continue to proliferate.
Significant opportunities exist for both public and private sector organizations to get ahead
of the curve and address these challenges head-on. Increased public awareness of GNSS
interference threats can lead to not only a more measured and proportional response by
private sector organizations, but also a more open discussion on how these threats can be
successfully mitigated. Public efforts to protect, toughen, and augment existing PNT systems,
such as those promoted by the RNT Foundation, combined with evidence-based reporting on
these issues, can serve to enhance this dialogue.

Grigoriy Bakunov, who investigated Moscow GNSS Spoofing activities in October 2016,
concluded that the transmission infrastructure near the Kremlin simulates GPS and GLONASS
signals at the L1 band and creates “noise” at the L2 and L5 bands. At the time, Bakunov believed
that the spoofed signals originated from within the Kremlin. For more information, see Grigoriy
Bakunov, “Почему Кремль во Внуково,” Telegram, October 19, 12:48, http://addmeto.cc/828.

In September 2017, Amungo Navigation claimed to have used a directional antenna
to show that the “GPS spoofer” is not in the Kremlin, as Bakunov had concluded, but is likely
situated outside the Kremlin. In the investigation video, an individual operating what is believed
to be Amungo Navigation’s XNZR Augmented Reality Direction Finder appears to record
directional signal strength at 1572.72 MHz at various points along Kremlevskaya Embankment
bordering the southern wall of the Kremlin. At several points in the video, the operator records
interference signals originating from the northeastern corner of 34 Sofiyskaya Embankment,
Building 1. For more information, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiy2Mt79M1c.

C4ADS also examined the possibility that the spoofing device used near Gelendzhik
could be based on an air platform, as posited by others who have examined this subject
(See
http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/13549/russia-may-be-testing-its-gps-spoofingcapabilities-around-the-black-sea). Using historical flight path data collected through ADS-B
Exchange (https://www.adsbexchange.com/), we found that aircraft operated by the Russian
Special Flight Detachment, tasked with providing transportation and communications support
for the Russian head of state and government delegations, conduct regular support missions

over Gelendzhik, Sochi, Kerch, and Crimea. While we found that these aircraft, namely the Tu214SR, conducted support missions over affected areas when we detected GNSS spoofing,
we also found that spoofing took place independent of these aircraft being on-station. This
could be the result of gaps in data or that these aircraft do not consistently broadcast ADS-B or
Mode-S signals when conducting these missions. At this time, C4ADS has not found evidence
to suggest that civilian or governmental aircraft are conducting GNSS spoofing activities near
Gelendzhik.
