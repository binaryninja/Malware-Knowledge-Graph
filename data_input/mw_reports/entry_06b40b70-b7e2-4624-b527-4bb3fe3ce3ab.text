PlugX goes to the registry (and India)

Overview
Recently we published a paper about the capabilities of APT groups [https://nakedsecurity.
sophos.com/2015/02/03/exploit-this-evaluating-the-exploit-skills-of-malware-groups/].
One of the conclusions of the paper was that the authors behind the targeted attack campaigns
usually have little knowledge about the actual exploit they are using to distribute their malware.
But at the same time, we warned our readers never to underestimate them, because otherwise
they are skilled, and quite capable of developing sophisticated backdoors.
One of the worst performances in our comparison of exploit development belonged to the
infamous PlugX malware group(s). However, they recently came out with a couple of significant
developments in the backdoor component, demonstrating the point above.
One of the improvements was the introduction of a peer-to-peer communication channel to other
infected hosts [http://blog.jpcert.or.jp/2015/01/analysis-of-a-r-ff05.html]. Variants using this
technology have previously been spotted in the Rotten Tomato campaign [http://blogs.sophos.
com/2014/10/30/the-rotten-tomato-campaign-new-sophoslabs-research-on-apts/].
Now additional samples have shown up from this generation. But in addition to the new
communication method, some of them were showing another new characteristic: the payload
was not stored as separate files, or embedded within the loader DLL, but instead was saved to
the registry.
Malware hiding components in registry is not a revolutionary idea; we have seen that before.
Most notably the recent Poweliks Trojan [https://blog.gdatasoftware.com/blog/article/poweliksthe-persistent-malware-without-a-file.html] stored the active script component in the registry.
Even some of the APT malware families, like Poison or Frethog, occasionally used the registry as
storage for the main payload.
There were precursors even within the criminal groups distributing PlugX: they used this method
back in 2013 in a couple of cases for storing the Omdork (a.k.a. Sybin) payload. So it was only a
question of when the same would happen to the main PlugX backdoor. And that time arrived this
January.

PlugX in registry
The new variants were distributed using two distinguishable classes of exploited carrier
documents – though in both cases the CVE-2012-0158 exploit was used.
For the first type the distribution was part of a longer campaign, targeting India. This campaign
spanned several months, from September 2014 to February 2015. During this time span
different variants of the PlugX backdoor were observed as the final payload. Apparently, this was
an ongoing operation, where the actors behind it used the latest available versions, as they came
out of the factory. Additionally, a few affiliated malware families were distributed to the targets.
The samples of the second type showed up the first week of February. At this point we don’t have
conclusive information about the scope and target of the campaign that used these samples.
The payload is stored in encrypted form in the registry. It is loaded, decrypted and executed
by the malware loader component. That loader is very similar to the usual PlugX loader DLLs,
except that it loads the payload from a registry key instead of a separate file.

PlugX payload in the registry

The stored payload is the new P2P PlugX backdoor, with internal function names not seen in
earlier PlugX v2 versions: ZX, ZXWT, JP1, JP2, JP3, JP4, JP5, JAP0, JAP1.
PlugX backdoors use a specific date parameter at specific places in the code. This constant
could be used as a major version identifier: when the backdoor code was only slightly modified,
the constant did not change. When the constant was updated, that usually meant a significant
change in the code.
In earlier versions this constant was a meaningful date in hexadecimal representation (e.g.
0x20130810 in most of the next generation PlugX samples). In the P2P PlugX version it changed,
now being a meaningful date in decimal representation (e.g. 0x13352AF = 20140719 in the case
of the Rotten Tomato samples).
In the case of registry stored PlugX variants, this constant was stepped further to 20150108,
which indicates a new development from the factory. Less than a month later these new variants
were already spotted in targeted campaigns in India.

Peeled Tomato
The first campaign we labelled as Peeled Tomato, in reference to the earlier Rotten Tomato case,
because they were clearly derived from those samples.
As a reminder, the original structure of the Rotten Tomato samples was the following:
Encrypted Zbot

CVE-2012-0158 exploit
and shellcode
CVE-2014-1761 exploit
and first stage shellcode
Memory marker and
CVE-2014-1761 second
stage shellcode
Encrypted PlugX

The RTF documents started with an encrypted Zbot Trojan (remainder of the original template
used for creating the samples), then a block using the CVE-2012-0158 exploit and the
corresponding shellcode. After that, there was a block using the CVE-2014-1761 exploit and the
corresponding first stage shellcode, followed by the second stage shellcode from the CVE-20141761 exploit, and finally the encrypted PlugX backdoor.
The first stage of the CVE-2014-1761 shellcode used a bad offset for the second stage code,
thus this exploit never worked.

Having realized the failure of the attempt, the malware authors removed the CVE-2014-1761
exploit block. But even that was not done completely. As a result, they ended up with documents
showing the following structure:
Encrypted Zbot

CVE-2012-0158 exploit
and shellcode
Memory marker and
CVE-2014-1761 second
stage shellcode
Encrypted PlugX

Samples
Not surprisingly, just like with several other campaigns, in this case it was observed that different
malware families were distributed using similar carrier documents; only the encrypted payload
was replaced at the end of the file. The shellcode used in the carrier was very convenient for
this purpose: the length and location of the final payload was stored at the end of the file. It was
possible to swap the payload without needing to modify the exploit condition and the shellcode
itself. And this is exactly what the malware authors did.

This sample is an outlier, as it was distributed in January 2015, and in Russia. The decoy
document is also unconvential, of minimalistic design.
But the carrier document and the C&C server name shows correlation with the rest of the

Multi-staged installer shellcode
This second batch of exploited documents had a different structure. All start with a heading RTF
content (which is exactly the same in all of the documents), followed by the block that exploits
the CVE-2012-0158 vulnerability, along with the first stage shellcode, followed by the second
and third stage shellcodes, and finally the encrypted payload executable.

RTF heading of exploited documents

The shellcode itself is encrypted with a 4 byte XOR algorithm, with a lot of inserted junk
instructions:
fprem1
add		edi, ebx
jz		short loc_13B
nop
fnclex
fldl2e
nop
and		ebx, ebx
test		eax, eax
fsin
xor		
[edi], esi
jp		short loc_14B
f2xm1
mov		edx, edx
nop
cld
fst		st(1)
pop		edi
jle		short loc_157
fldpi
fprem1
cmp		edi, esi
fdivrp
st(1), st
In the above code sample, only the XOR [EDI], ESI instruction is meaningful, performing the
decryption of the one dword; the rest are only polymorphic junk.

The underlying shellcode is multi-stage andhas already been observed in an earlier sample
dropping a PlugX v2 variant (SHA1: 9b90d6608ba6167619b5991fd70319dfcd1fa881, date
constant 0x20140613), but in that case without the top level cryptor.
After the initial bootstrap code is decrypted, it identifies the carrier by looking for ‘DCBA’ at file
offset 0x4e28. If it is found there, it allocates a memory area and decrypts (using one byte XOR
algorithm) the next stage starting from right after the ID string.
The second stage code decrypts and drops two files: the self-extracting installer archive M.B
and the first stage installer M.T into the %TEMP% folder, then allocates another memory region,
decrypts, copies and executes the third stage shellcode there.
The third stage shellcode copies the first stage installer (which is a DLL library) M.T into
%WINDOWS%\Tasks\n.dll, then executes by calling LoadLibrary to load it. The Windows loader
upon loading the DLL will execute its entry code. This entry code runs the self-extracting
installer archive M.B which will do the final malware installation in the system. This final piece of
installation process is malware family dependent.
First stage shellcode

Second stage shellcode

Third stage shellcode

This new shellcode also indicates some heavy development in the PlugX factory. Both this kind
of multi-stage shellcode and the external cryptor indicate that although the group is not top
class in exploit development, in conventional malware development they show serious skills,
which makes them dangerous.

This sample is an outlier. It does not distribute PlugX, but uses a strikingly similar persistence
method, with exactly the same file names that are used with PlugX installations. Only the final
payload is a different backdoor, Omdork, which has earlier been observed in PlugX related
distribution channels.

dll.
The persistence is achieved by two methods: RasTls.exe is registered in HKCU\Software\
Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run → msusr, and the n.dll is dropped to the Windows Tasks
directory for automatic execution.
While the file names are the same as in the case of many PlugX deployments, the files
themselves are very different.
RasTls.exe is not digitally signed, it is the loader Trojan, that loads the encrypted payload from
a resource. This payload itself contains a loader code, and an embedded executable, that is the
final payload.
The n.dll file executes a backup installer, M.B, which is dropped into the %TEMP% directory. This
installer is a self-extracting WinRAR that contains RasTls.exe and a config file.
There are still reasons to believe that this malware is strongly connected to the PlugX group:
ÌÌ It uses the same filenames as some of the PlugX deployments
ÌÌ It uses the same carrier document as the other PlugX variants
in this campaign, including the unique shellcode
ÌÌ The same n.dll is used in both the Omdork and PlugX deployments
