The Hive ransomware gang has been leveraging a novel obfuscation approach involving
IPv4 addresses and numerous conversions resulting in Cobalt Strike beacon downloads,
BleepingComputer reports. The new technique dubbed "IPfuscation" was identified by
Sentinel Labs researchers who examined various 64-bit Windows executables, all of which
had Cobalt Strike-delivering payloads. Hive has obfuscated the payload by impersonating
ASCII IPv4 addresses but converting the file from string to binary prompts the appearance of
shellcode. Researchers found that upon completion, the shellcode will be executed by the
malware through direct SYSCALLs or proxy execution. More IPfuscation variants have been
observed by researchers, with IPv6, MAC, and UUID addresses also being leveraged by the
ransomware group. The findings suggest that static signature dependence alone is
inadequate in detecting malicious payloads. Organizations should also deploy behavioral
detection, artificial intelligence-based analysis, and holistic security approaches for their
endpoints to better detect IPfuscation techniques, according to researchers.
