Threat Insight
Charting TA2541's Flight
February 15, 2022 Selena Larson and Joe Wise

Key Findings
Proofpoint researchers have tracked a persistent cybercrime threat actor targeting
aviation, aerospace, transportation, manufacturing, and defense industries for years.
The threat actor consistently uses remote access trojans (RATs) that can be used to
remotely control compromised machines.
The threat actor uses consistent themes related to aviation, transportation, and travel.
The threat actor has used similar themes and targeting since 2017.
Proofpoint calls this actor TA2541.

Overview
TA2541 is a persistent cybercriminal actor that distributes various remote access trojans
(RATs) targeting the aviation, aerospace, transportation, and defense industries, among
others. Proofpoint has tracked this threat actor since 2017, and it has used consistent tactics,
techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in that time. Entities in the targeted sectors should be
aware of the actor's TTPs and use the information provided for hunting and detection.
TA2541 uses themes related to aviation, transportation, and travel. When Proofpoint first
started tracking this actor, the group sent macro-laden Microsoft Word attachments that
downloaded the RAT payload. The group pivoted, and now they more frequently send
messages with links to cloud services such as Google Drive hosting the payload. Proofpoint
assesses TA2541 is a cybercriminal threat actor due to its use of specific commodity malware,
broad targeting with high volume messages, and command and control infrastructure.
While public reporting detailing similar threat activities exists since at least 2019, this is the
first time Proofpoint is sharing comprehensive details linking public and private data under
one threat activity cluster we call TA2541.

Campaign Details
Unlike many cybercrime threat actors distributing commodity malware, TA2541 does not
typically use current events, trending topics, or news items in its social engineering lures. In
nearly all observed campaigns, TA2541 uses lure themes that include transportation related

terms such as flight, aircraft, fuel, yacht, charter, etc.

TA2541 demonstrates persistent and ongoing threat activity since January 2017. Typically, its
malware campaigns include hundreds to thousands of messages, although it is rare to see
TA2541 send more than 10,000 messages at one time. Campaigns impact hundreds of
organizations globally, with recurring targets in North America, Europe, and the Middle East.
Messages are nearly always in English.
In the spring of 2020, TA2541 briefly pivoted to adopting COVID-related lure themes
consistent with their overall theme of cargo and flight details. For example, they distributed
lures associated with cargo shipments of personal protective equipment (PPE) or COVID-19
testing kits.

The adoption of COVID-19 themes was brief, and the threat actor quickly returned to generic
cargo, flight, charter, etc. themed lures.
Multiple researchers have published data on similar activities since 2019 including Cisco
Talos, Morphisec, Microsoft, Mandiant, and independent researchers. Proofpoint can
confirm the activities in these reports overlap with the threat actor tracked as TA2541.

Delivery and Installation
In recent campaigns, Proofpoint observed this group using Google Drive URLs in emails that
lead to an obfuscated Visual Basic Script (VBS) file. If executed, PowerShell pulls an
executable from a text file hosted on various platforms such as Pastetext, Sharetext, and
GitHub. The threat actor executes PowerShell into various Windows processes and queries
Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) for security products such as antivirus and
firewall software, and attempts to disable built-in security protections. The threat actor will
collect system information before downloading the RAT on the host.

4/12

Figure 4: Example attack chain.
While TA2541 consistently uses Google Drive, and occasionally OneDrive, to host the
malicious VBS files, beginning in late 2021, Proofpoint observed this group begin using
DiscordApp URLs linking to a compressed file which led to either AgentTesla or Imminent
Monitor. Discord is an increasingly popular content delivery network (CDN) used by threat
actors.
Although TA2541 typically uses URLs as part of the delivery, Proofpoint has also observed
this actor leverage attachments in emails. For example, the threat actor may send
compressed executables such as RAR attachments with an embedded executable containing
URL to CDNs hosting the malware payload.
Listed below is an example of a VBS file used in a recent campaign leveraging the StrReverse
function and PowerShell’s RemoteSigned functionality. It is worth noting the VBS files are
usually named to stay consistent with the overall email themes: fight, aircraft, fuel, yacht,
charter, etc.

The figure below depicts an example from a recent campaign where the PowerShell code is
hosted on the paste.ee URL.

Persistence:
Typically, TA2541 will use Visual Basic Script (VBS) files to establish persistence with one of
their favorite payloads, AsyncRAT. This is accomplished by adding the VBS file in the startup
directory which points to a PowerShell script. Note: the VBS and PowerShell file names used
are mostly named to mimic Windows or system functionality. Examples from recent
campaigns include:
Persistence Example:
C:\Users[User]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start
Menu\Programs\Startup\SystemFramework64Bits.vbs
Contents of VBS file:
Set Obj = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
Obj.Run "PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -File " & "C:\Users\
[User]\AppData\Local\Temp\RemoteFramework64.ps1", 0

HandlerUpdate64Bits.vbs

WindowsCrashReportFix.vbs
SystemHardDrive.vbs
TA2541 has also established persistence by creating scheduled tasks and adding entries in the
registry. For instance, in November 2021 TA2541 distributed the payload Imminent Monitor
using both of these methods. In recent campaigns, vjw0rm and STRRAT also leveraged task
creation and adding entries to the registry. For example:
Scheduled Task:
schtasks.exe /Create /TN "Updates\BQVIiVtepLtz" /XML C:\Users\
[User]\AppData\Local\Temp\tmp7CF8.tmp
schtasks /create /sc minute /mo 1 /tn Skype /tr "C:\Users\
[Use]\AppData\Roaming\xubntzl.txt"
Registry:
Key: HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\svchost
Data: C:\Users[User]\AppData\Roaming\server\server.exe
Key: HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\xubntzl
Data: C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\xubntzl.txt

Malware
Proofpoint has observed TA2541 using over a dozen different malware payloads since 2017.
The threat actor uses commodity malware available for purchase on criminal forums or
available in open-source repositories. Currently, TA2541 prefers AsyncRAT, but other
popular RATs include NetWire, WSH RAT and Parallax.

Figure 7: Malware used by TA2541 associated with message volume.
All the malware used by TA2541 can be used for information gathering purposes and to gain
remote control of an infected machine. At this time, Proofpoint does not know what the
threat actor’s ultimate goals and objectives are once it achieves initial compromise.
While AsyncRAT is the current malware of choice, TA2541 has varied its malware use each
year since 2017. The threat actor will typically use just one or a handful of RATs in observed
campaigns, however in 2020, Proofpoint observed TA2541 distributing over 10 different
types of malware, all using the same initial infection chain.

Infrastructure
9/12

TA2541 uses Virtual Private Servers as part of their email sending infrastructure and
frequently uses Dynamic DNS (DDNS) for C2 infrastructure.
There are multiple patterns across the C2 infrastructure and the message artifacts. For
example, historic campaigns have included the term “kimjoy” in the C2 domain name as well
as in the threat actor reply-to address. Another striking TTP is the common pattern observed
with TA2541 C2 domains and payload staging URLs containing the keywords “kimjoy,”
“h0pe,” and “grace”. TA2541 also regularly uses the same domain registrars including
Netdorm and No-IP DDNS, and hosting providers including xTom GmbH and Danilenko,
Artyom.

Victimology
Often, campaigns contained several hundred to several thousand email messages to dozens
of different organizations. Although Proofpoint has observed TA2541 targeting thousands of
organizations, multiple entities across aviation, aerospace, transportation, manufacturing,
and defense industries appear regularly as targets of its campaigns. There appears to be a
wide distribution across recipients, indicating TA2541 does not target people with specific
roles and functions.

Conclusion
TA2541 remains a consistent, active cybercrime threat, especially to entities in its most
frequently targeted sectors. Proofpoint assesses with high confidence this threat actor will
continue using the same TTPs observed in historic activity with minimal change to its lure
themes, delivery, and installation. It is likely TA2541 will continue using AsyncRAT and
vjw0rm in future campaigns and will likely use other commodity malware to support its
objectives.
