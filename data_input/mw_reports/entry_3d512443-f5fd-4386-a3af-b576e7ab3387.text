ESET analysis breaks down the first known spyware that is built on the AhMyth opensource espionage tool and has appeared on Google Play – twice

1/7

ESET researchers have discovered the first known spyware that is built on the foundations
of AhMyth open-source malware and has circumvented Google’s app-vetting process. The
malicious app, called Radio Balouch aka RB Music, is actually a fully working streaming
radio app for Balouchi music enthusiasts, except that it comes with a major sting in its tail –
stealing personal data of its users. The app snuck into the official Android app store twice,
but was swiftly removed by Google both times after we alerted the company to it.
AhMyth, the open-source Remote Access Tool from which the Radio Balouch app borrowed
its malicious functionality, was made publicly available in late 2017. Since then, we have
witnessed various malicious apps based on it; however, the Radio Balouch app is the very
first of them to appear on the official Android app store.
ESET’s mobile security solution has been protecting users from AhMyth and its derivatives
since January 2017 – even before AhMyth went public. As the malicious functionality in
AhMyth is not hidden, protected or obfuscated, it is trivial to identify the Radio Balouch app
– and other derivatives – as malicious, and classify them as belonging to the AhMyth family.
Besides Google Play, the malware, detected by ESET as Android/Spy.Agent.AOX, has
been available on alternative app stores. Additionally, it has been promoted on a dedicated
website, via Instagram, and YouTube. We have reported the malicious nature of the
campaign to the respective service providers, but received no response.
Radio Balouch is a fully working streaming radio app for music specific to the Balouchi
region (for the sake of consistency, we follow the spelling used in the campaign; the most
common transcriptions are “Balochi” or “Baluchi”). In the background, however, the app
spies on its victims.
On Google Play, we discovered different versions of the malicious Radio Balouch app twice
and in each case, the app had 100+ installs. We reported the first appearance of this app
on the official Android store to the Google security team on July 2nd, 2019, and it was
removed within 24 hours.
The malicious Radio Balouch app reappeared on Google Play on July 13th, 2019. This one,
too, was immediately reported by ESET and swiftly removed by Google.

After being removed from Google Play, the malicious radio app is only available on thirdparty app stores at the time of writing. It has also been distributed from a dedicated website,
radiobalouch[.]com, via a link promoted via a related Instagram account. This server was
also used for the spyware’s C&C communications (see below). The domain was registered
on March 30th, 2019, and shortly after our complaint, the website was down and still is at
the time of writing.
The attackers’ Instagram account still, at the time of writing, serves a link to the app that
has been removed from Google Play. They have also set up a YouTube channel with one
video introducing the app; apparently, they don’t promote it as the video has a mere 21
views at the time of writing.

Functionality
The malicious Radio Balouch app works on Android 4.2 and above. Its internet radio
functionality is bundled with the functionality of AhMyth into one malicious app.
After installation, the internet radio component is fully functional, playing a stream of
Balouchi music. However, the added malicious functionality enables the app to steal
contacts, harvest files stored on the device and send SMS messages from the affected
device.
Functionality for stealing SMS messages stored on the device is also present. However, this
functionality can’t be utilized since Google’s recent restrictions only allow the default SMS
app to access those messages.
As AhMyth has more variants whose functionalities vary, the Radio Balouch app and any
other malware based on this open-source espionage tool might get further functions in the
future via an update.
After launch, users choose their preferred language (English or Farsi); in the next step, the
app starts requesting permissions. First, it requests access to files on the device, which is a
legitimate permission for a radio app to enable its functionality; if declined, the radio would
not work.
Then, the app requests the permission to access contacts. Here, to camouflage its request
for this permission, it suggests this functionality is necessary should the user decide to
share the app with friends in their contact list. If the user declines to grant the contact
permissions, the app will work regardless.

After the setup, the app opens its home screen with music options, and offers the option to
register and login. However, any “registering” is meaningless as any input will bring the user
into the “logined” state, in the operators’ poor English. Probably, this step has been added
to lure credentials from the victims and try to break into other services using the obtained
passwords – a reminder to never reuse passwords across services. On a side note: the
credentials are transmitted unencrypted, over an HTTP connection.

For C&C communication, Radio Balouch relies on its (now defunct) radiobalouch[.]com
domain. This is where it would send information it has gathered about its victims – notably
information about the compromised devices, and the victims’ contacts lists. As with the
account credentials, the C&C traffic is transmitted unencrypted over an HTTP connection.

Conclusion
The (repeated) appearance of the Radio Balouch malware on the Google Play store should
serve as a wake-up call to both the Google security team and Android users. Unless
Google improves its safeguarding capabilities, a new clone of Radio Balouch or any other
derivative of AhMyth may appear on Google Play.
While the key security imperative “Stick with official sources of apps” still holds, it alone
can’t guarantee security. It is highly recommended that users scrutinize every app they
intend to install on their devices and use a reputable mobile security solution.
