updated activity in
2017:
New targets, use of MS Access
Macros and CVE 2017-0199, and
possible mobile espionage
By GReAT on October 30, 2017. 9:00 am

1. Summary information
The Gaza cybergang is an Arabic-language, politically-motivated
cybercriminal group, operating since 2012 and actively targeting the
MENA (Middle East North Africa) region. The Gaza cybergang’s attacks
have never slowed down and its typical targets include government
entities/embassies, oil and gas, media/press, activists, politicians, and
diplomats.
One of the interesting new facts, uncovered in mid-2017, is its discovery
inside an oil and gas organization in the MENA region, inﬁltrating systems
and pilfering data, apparently for more than a year.
Another interesting ﬁnding is the use of the recently discovered CVE
2017-0199 vulnerability, and Microsoft Access ﬁles into which the
download scripts were embedded to reduce the likelihood of their
detection. Traces of mobile malware that started to appear from late April
2017, are also being investigated.
Recent targets for the group seem to be varied in nature; the attackers do
not appear to be choosing targets selectively, but rather seeking diﬀerent
kinds of MENA intelligence.
Some of the interesting new updates about the Gaza cybergang:
Gaza cybergang attackers have continued their interest in
government entities in MENA
New targets identiﬁed include oil and gas in MENA
New tools and techniques include
Abuse of the CVE 2017-0199 vulnerability
Usage of macros inside Microsoft Access ﬁles, enabling lower
detection rates
Possible Android mobile malware being used by attackers

2. Technical details
Previously, Gaza cybergang attacks were surprisingly successful in using
simple and common tools to achieve their goals. They relied on a variety
of Remote Access Trojans (RATs) to perform their activities, including
Downeks, Qasar, Cobaltstrike…
As recently as June 2017, however, the attackers started using the CVE
2017-0199 vulnerability which enables direct code execution from a
Microsoft oﬃce document on non-patched victim systems (Cobaltstrike
payload in this case). Another ﬁnding is a possible Android Trojan that the
attackers positioned on one of their command servers in April 2017.
In most cases, malware is sent by email as a compressed attachment or
download links. Starting from March 2017, we have observed
downloaders or Microsoft oﬃce documents with embedded macros
being sent to victims. When opened, the downloader would contact a
URL or IP address to retrieve the actual payload. Once successfully
executed, the malware grants full access to the attackers, providing them
with the ability to collect ﬁles, keystrokes and screenshots from victims’
devices. If the initial downloaded malware was detected by the victim, the
downloader would attempt to retrieve other malware ﬁles to the victim’s
device, in the hope that one of those ﬁles would work.
The full list of indicators of compromise (IOCs) can be found in Appendix
I. The list of the most interesting lure content, malware ﬁles and related
droppers, and command servers can be found in Appendix II.

4. New ﬁndings
Gaza Cybergang attackers have been continuously evolving their skills on
diﬀerent levels, using new methods and techniques to deliver malware, in

addition to adapting social engineering decoys to regional political and
humanitarian incidents.
In mid-2017, the attackers were discovered inside an oil and gas
organization in the MENA region, inﬁltrating systems and pilfering data,
apparently for more than a year. The malware ﬁles that were found had
been reported previously: https://securelist.com/gaza-cybergangwheres-your-ir-team/72283/
While traces of Android mobile malware have been spotted, attackers
have continuously used the Downeks downloader and the Quasar or
Cobaltstrike RATs to target Windows devices, enabling them to obtain
remote access spying and data exﬁltration abilities. This is now achieved
more eﬃciently using the CVE 2017-0199 vulnerability which enables
direct code execution abilities from a Microsoft oﬃce document on nonpatched victim Windows systems. The use of Microsoft Access database
ﬁles has also enabled the attackers to maintain low levels of detection, as
it’s not an uncommon method to deliver malware.
These developments have helped the attackers continue their operations,
targeting a variety of victims and organizations, sometimes even
bypassing defences and persisting for prolonged periods.

4.1. The extended use of humanitarian
and political causes in social
engineering attacks
Attackers have continuously targeted victims and organizations in
government entities/embassies, oil and gas, media/press, activists,
politicians, and diplomats.
The Gaza cybergang relies increasingly on advanced and up-to-date
social engineering techniques with political and humanitarian aspects that
directly reﬂect regional incidents. Here is a short list of incidents that were
each used multiple times:
Palestinian Government not paying salaries to Gaza employees
Palestinian prisoners’ hunger strike in Israeli jails
The political crisis in Qatar
Recent targets for the group seem to be varied in nature, the attackers do
not appear to be choosing targets selectively, but rather seeking any type
of intelligence.

Microsoft Access ﬁles with macro is another new development by the
attacker group. MS Access database-embedded macros are proving to
have very low detection rates.

The attacks are a typical exploitation of CVE-2017-0199, starting with an
email that distributes a malicious RTF document. The vulnerability is in the
code that handles Ole2Link embedded objects, which allows Microsoft
Oﬃce Word to run remote ﬁles, downloaded in this case from
138.68.242[.]68. The downloaded payload is Cobaltstrike, which then
connects to lol.mynetav[.]org to receive commands from the attackers.
Additional details on the Gaza cybergang’s use of CVE 2017-0199 with
Cobaltstrike, can be found here:
http://bobao.360.cn/learning/detail/4193.html

4.4. Possible Android mobile malware
Traces of APK ﬁles have been seen on one of the attackers’ command
centers, starting from 23-04-2017.
URL: http://alasra-paper.duckdns[.]org/send/%D9%88%ket-Edition1.04_ApkHouse[.]com/Dont-Starve-Pocket-Edition1.04_ApkHouse[.]com.apk

The ﬁle name (Dont-Starve-Pocket-Edition-1.04_ApkHouse[.]com.apk), is
an Android application ﬁle hiding as a popular game. We believe the
android Trojan could be related to a previously investigated Android
Trojan around the Gaza strip: https://securelist.com/breaking-theweakest-link-of-the-strongest-chain/77562/

5. Conclusion

The Gaza Cybergang has demonstrated a large number of attacks and
advanced social engineering, in addition to active development of attacks,
infrastructure and the utilization of new methods and techniques.
Attackers are actively improving their toolkit in an eﬀort to minimize their
exposure to security products and services. Kaspersky Lab expects these
types of attacks to intensify in the near term, both in terms of quality and
quantity.
In order to protect your company from malware, Kaspersky Lab
researchers recommend implementing the following measures:
Educate staﬀ to be able to distinguish spear-phishing emails or a
phishing link from legitimate emails and links
Use proven corporate grade security solution in combination with
anti-targeted attacks solutions capable of catching attacks by
analyzing network anomalies
Provide security staﬀ with access to the latest threat intelligence data,
which will arm them with helpful tools for targeted attacks prevention
and discovery, such as indicators of compromise and YARA rules
Make sure enterprise grade patch management processes are well
established and executed.
