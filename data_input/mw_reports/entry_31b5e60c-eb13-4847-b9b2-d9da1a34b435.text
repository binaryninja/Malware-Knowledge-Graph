The digital credit card skimming landscape keeps evolving, often borrowing techniques used
by other malware authors in order to avoid detection.
As defenders, we look for any kind of artifacts and malicious infrastructure that we might be
able to identify to protect our users and alert affected merchants. These malicious artifacts
can range from compromised stores to malicious JavaScript, domains, and IP addresses
used to host a skimmer and exfiltrate data.
One such artifact is a so-called “gate,” which is typically a domain or IP address where stolen
customer data is being sent and collected by cybercriminals. Typically, we see threat actors
either stand up their own gate infrastructure or use compromised resources.
However, there are variations that involve abusing legitimate programs and services, thereby
blending in with normal traffic. In this blog, we take a look at the latest web skimming trick,
which consists of sending stolen credit card data via the popular instant messaging platform
Telegram.

An otherwise normal shopping experience

1/6

We are seeing a large number of e-commerce sites attacked either through a common
vulnerability or stolen credentials. Unaware shoppers may visit a merchant that has been
compromised with a web skimmer and make a purchase while unknowingly handing over
their credit card data to criminals.
Skimmers insert themselves seamlessly within the shopping experience and only those with
a keen eye for detail or who are armed with the proper network tools may notice something’s
not right.

The skimmer will become active on the payment page and surreptitiously exfiltrate the
personal and banking information entered by the customer. In simple terms, things like
name, address, credit card number, expiry, and CVV will be leaked via an instant message
sent to a private Telegram channel.

Telegram-based skimmer
Telegram is a popular and legitimate instant messaging service that provides end-to-end
encryption. A number of cybercriminals abuse it for their daily communications but also for
automated tasks found in malware.
Attackers have used Telegram to exfiltrate data before, for example via traditional Trojan
horses, such as the Masad stealer. However, security researcher @AffableKraut shared the
first publicly documented instance of a credit card skimmer used in Telegram in a Twitter
thread.

The skimmer code keeps with tradition in that it checks for the usual web debuggers to
prevent being analyzed. It also looks for fields of interest, such as billing, payment, credit
card number, expiration, and CVV.

The novelty is the presence of the Telegram code to exfiltrate the stolen data. The skimmer’s
author encoded the bot ID and channel, as well as the Telegram API request with simple
Base64 encoding to keep it away from prying eyes.

The exfiltration is triggered only if the browser’s current URL contains a keyword indicative of
a shopping site and when the user validates the purchase. At this point, the browser will
send the payment details to both the legitimate payment processor and the cybercriminals.

The fraudulent data exchange is conducted via Telegram’s API, which posts payment details
into a chat channel. That data was previously encrypted to make identification more difficult.
For threat actors, this data exfiltration mechanism is efficient and doesn’t require them to
keep up infrastructure that could be taken down or blocked by defenders. They can even
receive a notification in real time for each new victim, helping them quickly monetize the
stolen cards in underground markets.

Challenges with network protection
Defending against this variant of a skimming attack is a little more tricky since it relies on a
legitimate communication service. One could obviously block all connections to Telegram at
the network level, but attackers could easily switch to another provider or platform (as they
have done before) and still get away with it.
Malwarebytes Browser Guard will identify and block this specific skimming attack without
disabling or interfering with the use of Telegram or its API. So far we have only identified a
couple of online stores that have been compromised with this variant, but there are likely
several more.

As always, we need to adapt our tools and methodologies to keep up with financiallymotivated attacks targeting e-commerce platforms. Online merchants also play a huge role in
derailing this criminal enterprise and preserving the trust of their customer base. By being
proactive and vigilant, security researchers and e-commerce vendors can work together to
defeat cybercriminals standing in the way of legitimate business.
