About this talk
Get the latest on UNC2452, the actor behind the SolarWinds supply chain compromise
FireEye's Mandiant team recently uncovered a threat actor leveraging a supply chain to carry
out intrusions in a uniquely impactful campaign. The actor behind these intrusions,
UNC2452, focuses heavily on operational security, which has limited historic perspective on
their behavior and made them very difficult to detect; however, we are rapidly learning more
about them. Join our Mandiant experts for this webinar where we will offer the latest
intelligence on this important threat actor.
