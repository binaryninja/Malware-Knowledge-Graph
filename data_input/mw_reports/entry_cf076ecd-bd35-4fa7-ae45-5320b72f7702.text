CaddyWiper: Yet Another Data Wiping Malware Targeting
Ukrainian Networks

Two weeks after details emerged about a second data wiper strain delivered in attacks against
Ukraine, yet another destructive malware has been detected amid Russia's continuing military
invasion of the country.
Slovak cybersecurity company ESET dubbed the third wiper "CaddyWiper," which it said it first
observed on March 14 around 9:38 a.m. UTC. Metadata associated with the executable
("caddy.exe") shows that the malware was compiled at 7:19 a.m. UTC, a little over two hours prior
to its deployment.
CaddyWiper is notable for the fact that it doesn't share any similarities with previously discovered
wipers in Ukraine, including HermeticWiper (aka FoxBlade or KillDisk) and IsaacWiper (aka
Lasainraw), the two of which have been deployed in systems belonging to government and
commercial entities.

"The ultimate goal of the attackers is the same as with IsaacWiper and HermeticWiper: make the
systems unusable by erasing user data and partition information," Jean-Ian Boutin¸ head of threat
research at ESET, told The Hacker News. "All of the organizations targeted by the recent wiper
attacks were either in the governmental or financial sector."
Unlike CaddyWiper, both the HermeticWiper and IsaacWiper malware families are said to have
been in development for months in advance before their release, with oldest known samples
compiled on December 28 and October 19, 2021, respectively.

But the newly discovered wiper shares one tactical overlap with HermeticWiper in that the malware,
in one instance, was deployed via the Windows domain controller, indicating that the attackers had
taken control of the Active Directory server.
"Interestingly, CaddyWiper avoids destroying data on domain controllers," the company said. "This
is probably a way for the attackers to keep their access inside the organization while still disturbing
operations."
The wiper is programmed to systematically destroy all files located in "C:\Users," before moving on
to the next drive letter and erasing the files until it reaches the "Z" drive, meaning CaddyWiper will
also attempt to wipe any network mapped drive attached to the system.

"The file destruction algorithm is composed of two stages: a first stage to overwrite files and another
to destroy the physical disk layout and the partition tables along with it," Cisco Talos researchers
said in an analysis of the malware. "Destroying the start of the files and the partitions tables is a
common technique seen on other wipers, and its highly effective in preventing file recovery."
Microsoft, which has attributed the HermeticWiper attacks to a threat cluster tracked as DEV-0665,
said the "intended objective of these attacks is the disruption, degradation, and destruction of
targeted resources" in the country.
The development also arrives as cybercriminals have opportunistically and increasingly capitalized
on the conflict to design phishing lures, including themes of humanitarian assistance and various
types of fundraising, to deliver a variety of backdoors such as Remcos.

"The global interest in the ongoing war in Ukraine makes it a convenient and effective news event
for cybercriminals to exploit," Cisco Talos researchers said. "If a certain topic of lure is going to
increase the chances of a potential victim installing their payload, they will use it."
But it's not just Ukraine that's been at the receiving end of wiper attacks. Last week, cybersecurity
firm Trend Micro disclosed details of a .NET-based wiper called RURansom that has exclusively
targeted entities in Russia by encrypting the files with a randomly generated cryptographic key.
"The keys are unique for each encrypted file and are not stored anywhere, making the encryption
irreversible and marking the malware as a wiper rather than a ransomware variant," the researchers
noted.
