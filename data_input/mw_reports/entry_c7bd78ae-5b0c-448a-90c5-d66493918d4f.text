The FBI and CISA are issuing this PSA as a part of a series on threats to the 2020 election
to enable the American public to be prepared, patient, and participating voters.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency (CISA) are issuing this announcement to raise awareness of the potential threat
posed by attempts to spread disinformation regarding cyberattacks on U.S. voter registration
databases or voting systems.
During the 2020 election season, foreign actors and cyber criminals are spreading false and
inconsistent information through various online platforms in an attempt to manipulate public
opinion, discredit the electoral process, and undermine confidence in U.S. democratic
institutions. These malicious actors could use these forums to also spread disinformation
suggesting successful cyber operations have compromised election infrastructure and
facilitated the “hacking” and “leaking” of U.S. voter registration data.
In reality, much U.S. voter information can be purchased or acquired through publicly
available sources. While cyber actors have in recent years obtained voter registration
information, the acquisition of this data did not impact the voting process or the integrity of
election results. In addition, the FBI and CISA have no information suggesting any

cyberattack on U.S. election infrastructure has prevented an election from occurring,
compromised the accuracy of voter registration information, prevented a registered voter
from casting a ballot, or compromised the integrity of any ballots cast.
Recommendations

Seek out information from trustworthy sources, verify who produced the content, and
consider their intent.
Rely on state and local election officials for information about voter registration
databases and voting systems.
View early, unverified claims with a healthy dose of skepticism.
Verify through multiple reliable sources any reports about compromises of voter
information or voting systems, and consider searching for other reliable sources before
sharing such information via social media or other avenues.
Report potential election crimes—such as disinformation about the manner, time, or
place of voting—to the FBI.
If appropriate, make use of in-platform tools offered by social media companies for
reporting suspicious posts that appear to be spreading false or inconsistent information
about voter information or voting systems.
The FBI and CISA coordinate closely with federal, state, and local election partners and
provide services and information to safeguard U.S. voting processes and maintain the
integrity of U.S. elections. Both organizations urge the American public to critically evaluate
the sources of the information they consume and to seek out reliable and verified
information.
The FBI is responsible for investigating malign foreign influence operations and malicious
cyber activity targeting election infrastructure and other U.S. democratic institutions. CISA is
responsible for protecting the nation’s critical infrastructure from physical and cyber threats
and has provided voluntary guidance, training, exercises, and other resources to help state
and local election officials secure their voter registration systems and data.
Victim Reporting and Additional Information

The FBI encourages the public to report information concerning suspicious or criminal
activity to their local field office (www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices) or to the FBI’s Internet
