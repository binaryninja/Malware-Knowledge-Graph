Security investigators have concluded that the North Korean state-sponsored cybercriminal
group, Lazarus, would be conducting suspicious activities targeting companies based in
Russia. This is based on the connections discovered between the tactics, techniques and
tools detected and the mode of operation of the group also known as Hidden Cobra.
Affected Services
• Microsoft Windows Operating Systems
Technical details
The Lazarus campaign targeting Russia uses malicious Office documents delivered as ZIP
files, along with a PDF document called NDA_USA.pdf that contains a StarForce Technologies
agreement, which is a Russian software company that provides copy protection software.
The security community believes that Lazarus is divided into at least two subdivisions: the
first called Andariel, which focuses on attacking the government and organizations of South
Korea, and the second, Bluenoroff, whose main focus is monetization and campaigning.

global espionage
This incident, however, represents an unusual choice of victim by the North Korean threat
actor. Typically, these attacks reflect geopolitical tensions between the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) and nations such as the United States, Japan and South Korea.
Infection chain
The main infection flow consists of the following three main steps:
1. A ZIP file that contains two documents: a benign decoy PDF document and a malicious
Word document with macros.
2. The malicious macro downloads a VBS script from a Dropbox URL, followed by the
execution of the VBS script.
3. The VBS script downloads a CAB file from the server in the download zone, extracts the
embedded EXE file (KEYMARBLE) with the Windows “expand.exe” utility and finally executes
it.

KEYMARBLE

2/4

This malware is a remote administration tool (RAT) that provides its operators with basic
functionality to retrieve information from the victim's computer. Once executed, it performs
several initializations, contacts a Command and Control (C&C) server and waits indefinitely
to receive new commands. Each command received is processed by the backdoor and is
handled within an appropriate function, which in turn collects information or performs an
action on the target computer.

Our clients are recommended to follow the following preventive actions to reduce risks:
For information security personnel:
• Maintain a strict update protocol for operating systems, antivirus and all applications
running on them.
• Constantly raise awareness among users on issues related to computer security.
3/4

• Restrict the ability (permissions) of users to install and run unwanted software
applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless necessary.
• Block the commitment indicators (IOC) shown in the security devices of your
infrastructure.
** Before carrying out the blocking of IOCs, it is important that in the development
environment it is previously validated and confirmed at the level of internal and external
services, in order to apply the changes in a controlled manner.
For end users:
• Verify the account information that sends you an email, the name and address of the
recipient to identify if they are suspicious.
• Do not open emails of doubtful origin (unknown sender), or click on links, or download
unknown attachments.
• If a spam or phishing email is detected, report it immediately to the information security
officers of your institution.
• Scan all software downloaded from the Internet before execution.
• Visit secure web pages (https), and verify the digital certificate with a click on the status bar
lock.
