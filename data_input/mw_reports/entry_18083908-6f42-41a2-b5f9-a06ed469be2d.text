Summary
The REvil ransomware (a.k.a Sodinokibi) is a threat group that operates in the RaaS
(Ransomware-as-a-Service) model, where the infrastructure and the malware are supplied to
affiliates, who use the malware to infect target organizations. On July 2, the REvil threat
group launched a supply chain ransomware attack using an exploit in Kaseya’s VSA remote
management software. REvil claims to have infected more than one million individual
devices around the world. The attackers demanded $45,000 USD to restore the files from a
single infected device, or $70 million USD paid in BTC for a universal decrypter that will
allegedly work for all of the victims of the Kaseya attack. This threat is targeting anyone with
Kaseya’s VSA Remote Management Platform agent installed on Microsoft Windows systems
(any version).

Threat
The REvil group has likely used a zero-day exploit against Kaseya’s management server,
allowing the attackers to deploy the malware remotely on Windows devices running the VSA
agent application. The first step executed by the group was to deploy a base64-encoded file
to Kaseya’s working directory, which was probably ignored by anti-virus engines as
recommended by Kaseya.

Once the encoded file ( agent.crt ) was deployed, the attacker executed a set of shell
commands remotely to decode and execute the payload, as well as to disable the Windows
Defender protections. The decoded file ( agent.exe ) is a malware dropper that writes to
disk two different files:
1. MsMpEng.exe : This is an outdated version of Microsoft’s Antimalware Service that is
vulnerable to a technique known as DLL Hijacking.
2. mpsvc.dll : This is the packed REvil payload, which is loaded by MsMpEng.exe
through the DLL Hijacking technique.

Once executed, the REvil packed sample loads and executes a small shellcode, which is
responsible for unpacking and executing the final payload, which contains an encrypted
configuration within the binary.

REvil ransomware encrypted configuration
The data is encrypted with RC4, so we can use a small Python script to decrypt it:

After decrypting the configuration, we can obtain more detailed information about the
sample, such as the “affiliate” ID, ignored folders, C2 domains, etc.

REvil configuration
In this case, the “net” option is set to “false” in the configuration, which tells the ransomware
to ignore the C2 addresses. However, in case this option is set to “true,” the malware sends
a POST request to available addresses with information about the infected machine, such as
the encryption key and the machine name.

Within this REvil configuration, we have found 1,221 unique domains that could be used for
network communication.
After encrypting the files, REvil changes the user’s background:
