Domains created for malicious purposes are rarely registered on their own. When you have
identified such a domain, it is therefore always a good idea to look for other domains used
in the same campaign.
Sometimes finding such a domain is easy. For example, you may notice a very similar
domain (such as the .net version of a .com domain) registered with the same registrar on
the same day. At other times you will need to look for other evidence, for example find them
hosted on the same IP address.
In general, however, linking two domains through a single IP address isn’t strong enough
evidence that the domains themselves are linked. The link becomes a lot stronger though
when two or more domains were seen moving through the same set of IP addresses
1/9

simultaneously.
In previous blog posts, I used this to find five domains that used the same infrastructure and
that were made to look like they belonged to a content delivery network, as well as the
infrastructure of a LodaRAT campaign targeting Bangladesh.
In this blog post, I will share a few more examples of sets of malicious domains that moved
simultaneously through the same set of IP addresses. The sets of domains are linked and
there is some evidence to suggest that the infrastructure belongs to a bulletproof hosting
service.

Magecart
The first set of domains spoofs well known services such as Cloudflare, Google, jQuery and
Magento:
cloudflareplus[.]com
cloudflareplus[.]net
cloudflareshop[.]com
cloudflare[.]su
googleexpert[.]name
googleinfo[.]name
googlemanagerads[.]com
googlemaster[.]name
googleplus[.]name
gooqlescript[.]com
jquery24[.]com
jqueryexpert[.]com
jqueryinfo[.]com
jquery[.]su
jsstroy[.]com
magentoinfo[.]name
magentoinfo[.]org
magentoportal[.]com
magentostore[.]org
manualseos[.]ru
mycloudflare[.]net
procloudflare[.]com
procloudflare[.]net
seocmson[.]ru

These domains were all registered at Russian registrar REG.RU on the 3rd of November
2020 and have simultaneously moved through the same set of IP addresses. The all use
the name servers of DNSPod, a Chinese DNS hosting provider that has long been popular
with cyber criminals.
For the first three months of 2021, the domains were seen on the following twenty IP
addresses, in this order:

2/9

208.69.117[.]117
194.147.78[.]6
45.143.136[.]186
92.38.130[.]71
46.17.250[.]52
46.17.250[.]84
91.203.192[.]117
34.65.156[.]213
35.189.71[.]51
34.65.43[.]209
35.197.218[.]54
35.205.161[.]91
8.209.112[.]138
35.228.62[.]27
34.107.33[.]136
35.228.209[.]29
35.187.16[.]185
35.228.228[.]1
35.204.191[.]93
35.198.110[.]173

Sometimes, the domains only pointed to an IP address for less than a day, but in one case
they pointed to the same IP address for three weeks in a row.
The IP addresses belong to various hosting services, with a particular preference for
Google’s.
Interestingly, around the 8th of March, nine more domains joined the cycle:
bing-visitors[.]com
cloubfiare[.]net
googiemanager[.]com
googlemanagerads[.]com
googlemgr[.]net
googletag[.]name
gooqleads[.]net
qodaddy[.]net
yahoo-tracker[.]com

They have been pointing to the same IP address as the original set ever since.
There is public evidence linking these domains to Magecart. Magecart is an umbrella term
use to refer to more than a dozen groups that insert code into websites’ payment pages that
steals credit card data. A common trick used by Magecart groups is to make their domains
look like those from which code is regularly included into web pages. A website owner
looking at a web page’s source code may thus incorrectly assume the inclusion of thirdparty JavaScript is harmless.
Note: because the domains sometimes pointed to an IP address for a very short time
period, it is possible that the list of IP addresses above isn’t complete for the three-month
period January 1st to March 31st 2021. The same applies to the examples below.

IcedID and Qakbot
A second set of domains also cycled through a set of IP addresses, again all pointing to the
same IP address at the same point in time.
The domains are:

while the IP addresses are

8.211.4[.]209

The domains were registered between late February and mid March 2021, mostly through
Dutch registrar Hosting Concepts with a few using REG.RU instead. The nameservers used
were again those of DNSPod, while the IP addresses belong to Google and Alibaba.
Interestingly two of the IP addresses (marked in bold above) were also used by the
Magecart domains above, suggesting a possible link between the two sets.
Many of the above domains have been used to download either the IcedID or the Qakbot
malware. Both IcedID and Qakbot (also known as Qbot) are commonly used as initial
access brokers. Though no direct link between these two actors is known, recently URLs of
the type that previously served Qakbot started to serve IcedID instead.
This suggests that it is another actor that handles the spam campaigns that delivers either
malware, an example of the increased commoditization of cybercrime. This would also
explain why the domains listed above are different from the IcedID command and control
domains I wrote about recently, which use a different hosting infrastructure.

Ursnif and phishing
A third set of domains also cycled through a set of IP addresses:
6/9

aodacrtsrytuce[.]com
ashguq[.]com
chonlinedocstorage[.]com
companieshdocstorage-online[.]com
docusign-cloudab[.]com
docusign-cloudbc[.]com
docusign-cloudcd[.]com
docusign-cloud[.]com
docusign-vault[.]com
edssrdsceaaorb[.]com
exhssppceaaorb[.]com
hutnspiekeagrm[.]com
ioqpuyfshaio[.]com
ipqweyb[.]com
jyohjdowprwiondotrbkght[.]com
nbmipqw[.]com
ospzsiq[.]com
qpofsgw[.]com
rconalacrtnspi[.]com
rvprmsrirdeala[.]com
srirdelehssfaojr[.]com
srtnserqdelaeh[.]com
uidacrtsppxece[.]com
uiwoqp[.]com
upsdocstorage[.]com
upsdocstorage-online[.]com
vcavwq[.]com
wvmiap[.]com
zhdipqw[.]com

The IP addresses in this case are:
188.227.58[.]120
45.143.136[.]43
188.227.86[.]64
91.203.192[.]117
35.228.188[.]33
35.246.93[.]71
35.228.88[.]152

All these domains were registered through Eranet, a registrar based in Hong Kong, and
again used DNSPod’s nameservers. Two of the IP addresses, marked in bold, were also
used by the Magecart domains, suggesting a possible link.
Interestingly, there are two kinds of domains in the list. One the one hand, there are random
looking domains which, as with the IcedID/Qakbot domains above, could suggest a domain
generation algorithm (DGA). On the other hand, domains like docusign-cloud[.]com and
upsdocstorage[.]com of which one can be all but certain they have been used in phishing
campaigns: both DocuSign and UPS are commonly used in phishing lures.
It is not surprising therefore that these latter domains were taken down, often within a week
after becoming active: lookalike domains are actively hunted by the affected organisations.
7/9

As for the DGA-like domains, one of them, uidacrtsppxece[.]com, has been linked to Ursnif,
another common malware delivered in email campaigns.
It is unclear whether there is a direct link between Ursnif and the phishing domains beyond
the use of the same infrastructure, or even whether all DGA-like domains have served
Ursnif.

Other domains
There are many other domains that have used the same infrastructure, including the use of
the DNSPod DNS provider.
For example, the domains
ie-kbc[.]net
ie-kbc[.]org
kbc-ie[.]net
www.kbcbanking[.]net

will no doubt have been used to impersonate KBC, an Irish bank, while authoriseeebilling[.]com has likely targeted customers of UK mobile provider EE. There are also
several more domains that suggest a DGA.

Conclusion: a bulletproof hosting provider?
The similarities among the various sets described above, such as the use of DNSPod and
the sharing of IP addresses, suggests the campaigns described all use the same
infrastructure, likely that of a bulletproof hosting service.
A bulletproof hoster serves a similar function as a content-delivery network (CDN) does for
legitimate domains: making it harder for a denial-of-service attack. The “attack” in this case
would come from law enforcement and security researchers.
In the past, bulletproof hosters ran their own networks, which often led to the whole ASN
being blocklisted. More modern bulletproof hosters rent servers at cloud providers and set
these up as proxies for their customers’ content. By rotating through a set of IP addresses,
the content is less vulnerable to being blocked based on the IP address.
Intel471 recently wrote about bulletproof hosters and in particular mentioned DNSPod.
Of course, we cannot be 100% certain that this is a bulletproof hoster, or even that the
various campaigns do use the same infrastructure: the sharing of IP addresses may be a
coincidence, or because there is another party involved in renting the servers.
But this is yet another example that shows how understanding the context of a domain
name can help one find a lot of related infrastructure that is worth blocking, even without
having seen evidence of actual malicious activity.
