I found a tweet from @ps66uk from on Monday morning 2019-07-10 about an open directory
used in malspam to push an information stealer called AZORult. The open directory is
hosted on sfoodfeedf[.]org at www.sfoodfeedf[.]org/wp-includes/Requests/Cookie/

Shown above: The open directory at sfoodfeedf[.]org.
@ps66uk already mentioned a file named purchase order.iso which is an ISO file containing
an executable file for AZORult. However, I found another one in the same directory named
201907060947039062.iso. Further analysis showed it was also AZORult, like the other ISO
file.

Shown above: Extracting the EXE file from the ISO on a Windows 7 host.
In previous AZORult infections in my lab, the malware usually deleted itself after an initial
exfiltration of data. This one repeatedly did callback traffic, and there was a .vbs file made
persistent on my infected Windows host during the infection. This is apparently a more
recent variant of AZORult dubbed AZORult++ as described by Kaspersky Labs and followedup by BleepingComputer. It's called AZORult++ because it's now compiled in C++ after
formerly being compiled in Delphi.

3/7

Shown above: Traffic from the infection filtered in Wireshark.

Shown above: TCP conversations from my infected Windows host.

4/7

Shown above: An example of the AZORult callback traffic.

Shown above: This AZORult EXE was compiled with C++, a characteristic of AZORult++.

5/7

Shown above: VBS file made persistent on my infected Windows host.

Earlier this month on 2019-07-01, I saw an AZORult sample (also compiled in C++) which
did the expected two HTTP post requests to exfiltrate data, then deleted itself from my
infected host. Today's example proves there can be some variation in AZORult infection
activity.
