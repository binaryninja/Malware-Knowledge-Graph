Scammers and malware authors are taking advantage of the coronavirus crisis in full swing.
We have seen a number of spam campaigns using COVID-19 as a lure to trick people into
installing a variety of malware, but especially data stealers.
As more of us work from home, the need to secure your computer, especially if you are
connecting to your company’s network, becomes more important. However, you should be
extra careful of bogus security software, especially if it tries to use the coronavirus as a
selling point.

Corona antivirus: 100% fake
The latest scam we found is a website (antivirus-covid19[.]site) advertising “Corona Antivirus
-World’s best protection.” That’s right, scammers are trying to get you to install a digital
antivirus that supposedly protects against the actual COVID-19 virus infecting people across
the world.

To add to the nonsense, the site goes on by adding:
Our scientists from Harvard University have been working on a special AI development
to combat the virus using a windows app. Your PC actively protects you against the
Coronaviruses (Cov) while the app is running.

Infected victims added to BlackNET RAT
Upon installing this application, your computer will be infected with malware. The file, packed
with the commercial packer Themida turns your PC into a bot ready to receive commands:
hxxps[://]instaboom-hello[.]site//connection[.]php?data=[removed]
hxxps[://]instaboom-hello[.]site//getCommand[.]php?[removed]
hxxps[://]instaboom-hello[.]site//receive[.]php?command=[removed]

The command and control server hosted at instaboom-hello[.]site reveals the control panel
for the BlackNET botnet.

Stealing Bitcoin wallets

Choose the right protection
During this period, it is important to stay safe both at home and online. The number of scams
we have seen during these past few weeks shows that criminals will take advantage of any
situation, no matter how dire it is.
We recommend that you keep your computer up to date and use extra caution when
downloading new programs. Beware of instant notifications and other messages, even if they
appear to come from friends.
Malwarebytes users were already protected even though we had not seen this malware
sample before, thanks to our Machine learning engine.

We also informed CloudFlare since the threat actors were abusing their service and they
took immediate action to flag this website as a phish.
