BlackEnergy trojan strikes again: Attacks
Ukrainian electric power industry

CYBERCRIME

TAGS

On December 23 rd, 2015, around half of the homes in the Ivano-Frankivsk region in Ukraine (population
around 1.4 million) were left without electricity for a few hours. According to the Ukrainian news media
outlet TSN, the cause of the power outage was a “hacker attack” utilizing a “virus”.
Looking at ESET’s own telemetry, we have discovered that the reported case was not an isolated incident

and that other energy companies in Ukraine were targeted by cybercriminals at the same time.
Furthermore, we found out that the attackers have been using a malware family on which we have had our
eye for quite some time now: BlackEnergy. Speciﬁcally, the BlackEnergy backdoor has been used to plant
a KillDisk component onto the targeted computers that would render them unbootable.

(Un)related events?
The BlackEnergy trojan has been used for various purposes in the past few years. At the Virus Bulletin
conference in 2014, we discussed a series of cyber-espionage attacks against high-value, governmentrelated targets in Ukraine. The malware operators have used numerous spreading mechanisms to infect
their victims, including the infamous PowerPoint 0-day CVE-2014-4114. While the primary objectives of the
2014 attacks appeared to be espionage, the discovery of BlackEnergy trojan-droppers capable of infecting
SCADA Industrial Control Systems hinted that the gang might be up to something more dramatic.
In the recent attacks against electricity distribution companies in Ukraine, a destructive KillDisk trojan was
downloaded and executed on systems previously infected with the BlackEnergy trojan.
The link between BlackEnergy and KillDisk was ﬁrst reported by CERT-UA in November. In that instance, a
number of news media companies were attacked at the time of the 2015 Ukrainian local elections. The
report claims that a large number of video materials and various documents have been destroyed as a
result of the attack.

Electricity distribution companies under attack
Currently we know of several electricity distribution companies in Ukraine (other than the medialized case
of Prykarpattya Oblenergo, already picked up by the media) that have been targeted by cybercriminals. We
can conﬁrm that the BlackEnergy backdoor was used against some of them and that the destructive
KillDisk component was also used in more recent cases observed during the week of Christmas Eve, 2015.
Additionally, BlackEnergy was also detected at electricity companies earlier in 2015; while we have no
indication of KillDisk being used at that time, it is possible that the cybercriminals were then at the
preparatory stage of the attack.
The infection vector used in these attacks is Microsoft Oﬃce ﬁles containing malicious macros. We have
observed the BlackEnergy gang using this common technique, also employed by Dridex and other gangs,
throughout 2015.
The attack scenario is simple: the target gets a spear-phishing email that contains an attachment with a
malicious document. The Ukrainian security company CyS Centrum published two screenshots of emails
used in BlackEnergy campaigns, where the attackers spoofed the sender address to appear to be one
belonging to Rada (the Ukrainian parliament). The document itself contains text trying to convince the
victim to run the macro in the document. This is an example where social engineering is used instead of
exploiting software vulnerabilities. If victims are successfully tricked, they end up infected with BlackEnergy
Lite.

As explained in our Virus Bulletin talk, the BlackEnergy trojan is modular and employs various
downloadable components to carry out speciﬁc tasks. In the case of the most recent attack in Ukraine, the
Win32/KillDisk malware was found on the infected system.
As well as being able to delete system ﬁles to make the system unbootable – functionality typical for such
destructive trojans – the KillDisk variant detected in the electricity distribution companies also appears to
contain some additional functionality speciﬁcally intended to sabotage industrial systems.
Firstly, it was possible to set a speciﬁc time delay after which the destructive payload was activated. Then,
apart from the regular KillDisk functionality, it would try to terminate two non-standard processes:
komut.exe and sec_service.exe. The second process, sec_service.exe, may belong to software called
ELTIMA Serial to Ethernet Connector or to ASEM Ubiquity, a platform commonly used in Industrial Control
Systems (ICS). If this process is found on the target system, the trojan will not only terminate it but will also
overwrite its corresponding executable ﬁle on the hard drive with random data in order to make restoration
of the system more diﬃcult.

Conclusion
Destructive malware is not a new phenomenon. While even some of the earliest viruses used to have
destructive functionality intended mostly as a prank, today’s cybercriminals use such components for a
number of reasons, ranging from sabotage, or hacktivism, to covering their tracks after a successful cyberespionage attack. The Flamer (a.k.a. Flame or sKyWIper) malware is one of the most notorious examples. A
data-wiping component has, reportedly, also been used in the attack against Sony Pictures. It should be
clear, though, that a trojan capable of ‘wiping’ ﬁles or a few sectors of a hard-drive is not exactly unique
and if we take into account the imprecise nature of malware naming (many such trojans have been called

‘Wiper’, or a similar derivative of the word), then speculations, unsubstantiated correlations and linking of
unrelated incidents are bound to happen.
Even the BlackEnergy malware family has used a dstr destructive plugin in 2014. However, unlike the
recent KillDisk variants used in attacks against media companies and the electricity distribution industry, it
appeared as a generic ‘self-destruct’ component and we are not sure of its intended purpose.
Our analysis of the destructive KillDisk malware detected in several electricity distribution companies in
Ukraine indicates that it is theoretically capable of shutting down critical systems. However, there is also
another possible explanation. The BlackEnergy backdoor, as well as a recently discovered SSH backdoor,
themselves provide attackers with remote access to infected systems. After having successfully inﬁltrated
a critical system with either of these trojans, an attacker would, again theoretically, be perfectly capable of
shutting it down. In such case, the planted KillDisk destructive trojan would act as a means of making
recovery more diﬃcult.
We can assume with a fairly high amount of certainty that the described toolset was used to cause the
power outage in the Ivano-Frankivsk region.
Although in Ukraine, Christmas is traditionally not celebrated on December 24 th and 25 th , a group of
cybercriminals has chosen this time of year to deliver a dark ‘present’ to a few hundred thousand people
and many more might have also been this ‘lucky’, had the malware not been detected.
For further information on the situation, thoughts and takeaways, read this post on the SANS Industrial
Control Systems Security Blog. Additional details on the malware used in the attacks and Indicators of
Compromise can be found in our technical blog post.
