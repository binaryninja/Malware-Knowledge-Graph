THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORT

Proactive Threat Identification Neutralizes
Remote Access Trojan Efficacy By Levi Gundert
Executive’s Business Case
Continuously incorporating known remote access trojan (RAT) controller locations into operational defense workflow and
detection technologies is useful, and automating correlation with internal telemetry will identify potential infections, but the
deeper value to the business, that reduces risk, is to understand the adversary behind each RAT instance.
Adversary attribution is difficult, but worthwhile, since motivation informs methodology. Exploring an attacker’s capabilities
and infrastructure becomes an ancillary benefit. One of the best ways to achieve consistent attribution results is to develop
original attribution methodologies. An example of one such methodology – proactive Internet services enumeration – and
the applied results for Trojans like njRAT and Dark Comet are detailed in this report.

Background
A remote access trojan (RAT)1 is a feature-rich controller/server software suite that facilitates surreptitious (as its name
suggests) and unauthorized access to a victim’s computer. RATs are generally leveraged by adversaries with malicious
intent to record local victim audio, video, keystrokes (in addition to exfiltrating files), and more2.
The full spectrum of threat actors – especially criminals and nation-state agents – continue to leverage commodity RATs
even after the original author has been apprehended3. Nation-state campaigns have routinely included payloads like
Poison Ivy4 and close derivatives because they are easy to configure, highly re-usable, and the RAT remains an effective tool
against anti-virus software. This is especially true of dictatorial regimes that use RATs to hunt for the identity and location
of political dissidents5 within their own borders.
Criminals use RATs because the technical barriers to entry are low and the knowledge required to effectively operate a
RAT can be quickly acquired from free Internet tutorials6 which feature content such as packing/crypting7 a RAT to evade
anti-virus software; demonstrating capabilities with multiple victims8; and establishing infrastructure9, like dynamic DNS
(DDNS)10, to support a long-term operation.
A remote access tool (RAT) is legitimately used by system administrators. In this report’s context, RAT is used to refer only to Trojans that are used for
malicious purpose

Proactive Threat Identification Neutralizes Remote Access Trojan Efficacy

In a bit of a reversal from traditional botnet nomenclature, a commodity RAT file (executable) is typically labeled as the
“server” when it is installed on a victim host (through any number of “spreading” mechanisms), and the client (control panel)
“or controller” resides on the RAT operator’s computer.
Historically, the security community has generally relied upon passive malware collection methodologies to identify RAT
families and campaigns. Sources include customer telemetry, honeypots, and malware processing and aggregation
services like VirusTotal. While these are useful resources, using them makes it is difficult to quickly and proactively identify
all live instances of a particular RAT campaign. Additionally, the derivative insight that businesses rely on is largely reactive
and only as good as the sources collecting the malware.
Today, threat intelligence teams continue to depend on the bulk processing of malware samples for derivative indicators of
compromise (IOCs) that support new rules in defensive technologies. This approach, while partially effective, relies on large
amounts of computing and Internet resources to process the tens (to hundreds) of thousands of daily malware samples
collected by security vendors. The problem is that even anti-virus companies encounter challenges processing the vast
amount of daily samples.
The solution is proactive and iterative large scale Internet enumeration (scanning), which allows businesses to identify
hosts matching specific RAT signatures, and those hosts may lead to quick and direct operator attribution.
This scanning approach reveals a high number of RAT operator locations that were previously unknown to primary malware
resources – VirusTotal and #totalhash. Additionally, many of the RAT controllers are located on residential ISP (Internet
Service Provider) subnets, potentially indicating the RAT operator’s physical location.

Originating Intelligence
Internet scanning was largely impractical when Nmap11 was the only available off-the-shelf option (short of writing a custom
asynchronous multithreading scanner). The release of Unicorn Scan12, and more recent releases of Zmap13, and MASSCAN14
respectively, enabled the enumeration of the full IPv4 address space in a relatively short amount of time – minutes – from
a single connected device. In addition to open port discovery, these tools return daemon banner information that is highly
useful for identifying RAT controllers. Port scanning tools are often used to identify and count specific services available to
the public Internet, and using these same tools to identify and profile RATs is advantageous both for law enforcement and
operational defenders.
RATs return specific responses (strings) when a proper request is presented on the RAT controller’s listener port. Specific
signatures are withheld in this report to avoid adding a chapter to the threat actor playbook, but it is a straightforward
process to profile a RAT family. In some cases, even a basic TCP three-way handshake15 is sufficient to elicit a RAT controller
response. The unique response is a fingerprint indicating that a RAT controller (control panel) is running on the computer
in question. Therefore RAT controllers and their operators are inherently vulnerable because they are often operating
openly on the Internet and they generate unique response strings when properly interrogated.
To profile a specific RAT family, samples and/or full packet captures (PCAP) must be obtained. Fortunately, there
are numerous security researchers that publicly and generously share malicious code (malware) generated network
packet captures16.

Analysis of RAT controller responses within these packet captures leads to digital fingerprints that can be subsequently
used in tandem with an Internet scanner to identify live instances of RAT controllers, and in some cases the RAT operator’s
home IP address and approximate geographic location.
For example, one version of a ubiquitous RAT returns a “0” subsequent to an HTTP GET method.

Enumeration of a /20 subnet in Palestine with MASSCAN reveals a signature match with a specific host on port 1177.

Similarly, a scan of a /16 residential subnet in Algeria reveals multiple hosts listening on port 1177, but only one –
197.205.47.239 – that matches the above signature.

Positive matches can be further confirmed via Curl17 or Python Scapy18 to identify potential false positives.

Potentially there are additional legitimate daemons that may also return a “0,” thus complete certainty about a positive RAT
verdict in this case is absent. Rather, this is one example of RAT profiling with a fairly unique RAT controller response string.
Another example is Havex RAT19. Netresec produced an informative blog in 201420 dissecting Havex’s communication
pattern. Noticeably, the Havex response includes the string “havex.”

Scaling the Methodology
Shodan21, the search engine for Internet services, created and currently maintained by John Matherly - is incorporated to
scale RAT identification efforts. Shodan contains multiple benefits when compared to traditional scanning tools, including
un-attributable tasking, continuous scanning without building and maintaining infrastructure, and Shodan contains
hundreds of additional signatures for popular ports and services. Shodan’s Web application and command line interface
(CLI) are both easy to use, and Shodan results include all available port information for any given host.

Shodan’s signatures also include RATs, specifically Black Shades, Dark Comet, njRAT, XtremeRAT, Poison Ivy, and Net Bus.
Thus Shodan is a valuable and useful originating intelligence source for identifying live RAT controllers. While the number
of results varies, Shodan typically identifies between 400 and 600 individual RAT controllers on any given day. The results
from September 18, 2015, can be downloaded from Recorded Future’s GitHub page.
A week’s worth of consolidated and unique RAT controller IP addresses from early July 2015 totaled 633. The week
following, VirusTotal returned derivative malware results for 153 of the 633 IP addresses or a 24% positive correlation
rate22. Consequently, this originating methodology applied with Shodan identifies RAT controller instances often before the
malware sample is submitted to VirusTotal, making it useful as a unique threat source.

Further, many of the RAT IP addresses are located on residential (and dynamically allocated) networks. RAT operators often
run the RAT control panel from home because proxies introduce latency which degrades performance, especially when
the RAT operator is interested in collecting live video feeds from a victim’s camera (“webcam”). In those countries where
the unauthorized access of a computer is a crime, law enforcement need only send a subpoena (or equivalent) to the
respective Internet Service Provider to identify the likely RAT operator’s identity and residential location.
Between August 17-21, 2015 Shodan RAT results were collected and a list of 471 unique RAT controller locations were
identified23.

Using the results from July and August 2105, the RAT controller locations were further enriched to understand individual
instances, the corresponding RAT operators, and their respective motivations.

Enriching Intelligence
As previously mentioned, VirusTotal further confirms and enriches the RAT controller results with associated malware
metadata. Additional valuable enrichment sources that are programmatically available include Team Cymru and Recorded
Future.
Recorded Future’s API offers valuable open source verdict confirmation and data enrichment. The Python API script used
to produce the full Recorded Future results for the consolidated list of RAT IP addresses is located on Recorded Future’s

To enrich the list of RAT controller locations from August 17-21, 2015, the list of IP addresses was submitted to Recorded
Future and Virus Total. The Recorded Future IOC enrichment script returned “entity cards” (for relevant IP addresses) that
summarized available information. The enrichment script24 also returned information for input domains retrieved from
Virus Total results for the original RAT controller IP list.

Proactive RAT Operator Attribution
Example 1 – VirusTotal

Earlier this year Shodan identified a Dark Comet controller running on 90.212.68.218 (Sky Broadband) in the United Kingdom.

Quick IP address enrichment included VirusTotal’s associated malware sample with filename, “DeathBotnet!.exe” and
domain – yobrohasan[.]ddns.net. “Yobrohasan” is a distinct string that leads to a cached image on the now defunct snog.
com of an individual using the moniker “yobrohasan.”

It’s impossible to fully attribute this particular Dark Comet instance to the above individual, as the RAT operator may have
purposefully chosen the “yobrohasan” sub-domain in an attempt at a disinformation campaign, or perhaps the subdomain
was chosen due to dislike for the aforementioned individual, or the subdomain choice may have been a coincidence. As
previously mentioned, attribution is difficult, and this example serves as a good reminder for the remainder of this report.

Example 2 – Team Cymru

In July 2015, Team Cymru observed a high port UDP session between a njRAT controller IP address – 5.28.184.242 (Ramat
Gan Hot Internet, Israel) and a host at 196.36.153.134 (Internet Solutions, South Africa).
In addition to identifying njRAT on port 1177, Shodan further identified UPnP running on port 1900 and HTTP services
running on port 80 and 8080 (“WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm=”NETGEAR DGN2200v2BEZEQ”) respectively, potentially
indicating that the 5.28.184.242 host is also acting as a proxy.
In June, 2015, Team Cymru identified a DNS A record for xheemax.x64.me resolving to 5.28.184.242. The subdomain
“xheemax” is a unique string used to produce a new domain from the DDNS service x64.me. The domain currently resolves
to 149.78.239.193 (PSINet, Israel).
The online moniker “xheemax” appears in multiple forums beginning in 2011 when the actor asks for assistance in
“disabling the small light on the laptop webcam.”25 A profile is also maintained on CryptoSuite26 as “xheemax Hakkinda” and
the “About Me” section contains “RAT” and “Cybergate.”
In 2014, Team Cymru’s #totalhash27 also identified xheemax.no-ip.info (204.95.99.109), with corresponding SHA1 hash
- 329ed5ef04535f5d11d0e59a361263545d740c6128.
Example 3 – Maltego

Importing the RAT controller IP addresses – from Shodan results for August 17-21, 2015 – into Maltego reveals an enormous
amount of commonality.

The nodes with the highest number of links are related to IP address location checking. The native Maltego transforms
specifically correlate over 50 RAT controller IP addresses with websites that include localiser-ip[.]com and iplocationtools[.]

Visualization of large data sets enables the identification
of “choke points” – through commonality – comprised of
(in this case) adversary resources and/or tactics that can
be identified and addressed by operational defenders to
increase defensive technology efficacy.
Example 4 – Recorded Future

Recorded Future matched a RAT controller IP address to
a Pastebin reference – http://pastebin.com/cU4WX0hs –
alleging the IP address owner is “Daniel”. The Paste author
proceeds to list Daniel’s personally identifiable information
(PII) including date of birth, email, and physical address near
Oxford, UK.
The paste author further alleges that “Daniel” works for
powerstresser[.]com – an ethically dubious “booter” service29
designed to “stress test” servers. If the Paste information is
correct, this represents an extremely simple case of RAT
operator attribution.

Conclusion
Original, focused, and scalable intelligence methodologies are useful for law enforcement and for defending the enterprise,
as demonstrated here. Identifying RAT controller locations and operators before their respective RAT spreading campaigns
begin reduces malware processing resources.
Threat data enrichment sources such as Recorded Future increase attribution knowledge, in this case around RAT
operators, which lead to enhanced understanding of motivations and derivative tools, techniques, and procedures.
Proactive and repeatable Internet enumeration for known RAT signatures is a viable methodology for producing an
operational feed of malicious observables, and more importantly, also presenting further strategic opportunities to identify
and understand the adversary.
RAT operators are inherently vulnerable because they are often operating openly on the Internet and the RATs they buy
or download generate unique response strings when properly interrogated. The vulnerability extends further because the
RAT service listening on a specified port is an easy remote entry point to the attacker’s computer.
