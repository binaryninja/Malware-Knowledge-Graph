The last in our series on IIS threats introduces a malicious IIS extension used to manipulate
page rankings for third-party websites

1/11

ESET researchers have discovered and analyzed a previously undocumented server-side
trojan that manipulates search engine results by hijacking the reputation of the websites it
compromises. We named the trojan IISerpent to highlight its two main features: being
implemented as a malicious extension for Internet Information Services (IIS) web server,
and using shady techniques to manipulate search engine result pages (SERPs). IISerpent’s
operators use a variety of techniques for search engine optimization (SEO), in an attempt to
improve page ranking for third-party websites – likely the paying customers of these
criminals.
This blogpost is the last installment in our series where ESET researchers put IIS web
server threats under the microscope – the previous parts discuss IIS malware used for
cybercrime and cyberespionage. For a comprehensive guide on how to detect, analyze and
remove IIS malware, refer to our white paper Anatomy of native IIS malware, where
IISerpent is featured as one of the studied families (Group 13).

Attack overview
IISerpent is implemented, and configured, as a malicious extension for IIS – Microsoft’s web
server software. That allows the malware to intercept all HTTP requests made to the
websites hosted by the compromised server, but also to actively change the server’s HTTP
responses. In the previous installments of this series, we discussed how other IIS malware
families leverage these powers – for example, to steal credit card information from ecommerce website customers (IIStealer), or to execute backdoor commands on the
compromised IIS server (IISpy).
Contrary to those families, IISerpent directly affects neither the compromised server nor the
server’s users – in fact, this malware completely ignores all requests coming from legitimate
visitors of the compromised websites. The malware listens to and parses all HTTP requests
sent to the compromised server, only to search for those originating from specific search
engine crawlers. As shown in Figure 1, IISerpent relays these requests to its C&C server (or
uses its local configuration) to modify the content served to these crawlers.

SEO fraud
What is the purpose of this scheme? Search engines regularly crawl the internet, and then
index (record) all the content found online, building associations between search terms and
the content and using various algorithms to calculate rankings of the results for particular
search terms.
Various legitimate techniques can be used to increase page ranking in search engine result
pages – buying advertisements or employing search engine optimization (SEO) strategies –
but not all digital marketers play by the rules. The term unethical SEO (historically known as
black hat SEO) refers to SEO-boosting techniques (which, however, violate webmaster
guidelines), such as loading pages with irrelevant keywords, or buying backlinks to increase
a website’s reputation.
IISerpent’s attack pattern uses some of these unethical SEO techniques, and could be best
described as “SEO fraud as a service” – as it employs SEO fraud techniques on
compromised IIS servers for the benefit of a third party without webmaster consent.
IISerpent’s operators use this malware to boost page ranking for third-party websites by
leeching off the compromised website’s ranking and by employing the following techniques:
Redirecting the search engines to the particular website chosen by the attacker,
effectively making the compromised website a doorway page
Injecting a list of backlinks (pre-configured or obtained from the C&C server on the fly)
into the HTTP response for search engine crawlers, making the servers compromised
by IISerpent something of a link farm
In an example scenario shown in Figure 2, an adversary compromises a number of IIS
servers with IISerpent, and uses its capabilities to inject backlinks to all websites hosted by
these servers. Websites 1 – N are legitimate, with good reputations; from the perspective of
a search engine crawler, they all link to a third-party website of the attacker’s choice (in this
case, a scam website). As a result, the scam website may seem more popular – since it is
referenced by reputable websites – which may boost its page ranking.

Figure 2. Example of an SEO fraud mechanism

Note that the legitimate visitors of the compromised server will still be served the expected
content, so the users and the webmaster may fail to notice that something is wrong with the
server. This sets IISerpent apart from other malware families that inject artificial backlinks
into compromised sites – by operating as a server extension, IISerpent can reserve these
modifications for the search engine crawlers, without interfering with content served to
standard visitors (as opposed to permanently modifying the compromised website by
adding the undesired backlinks for all its visitors to see).
Of course, the misused websites hosted on the compromised IIS servers do not benefit at
all in this scheme – on the contrary, it is against the webmaster guidelines to fool the search
engine crawlers by displaying a different version of the website to them than the one shown
to the regular visitors, and so these websites could even end up penalized by the search
engines, lowering their SEO statistics.

Technical analysis
Under its skin, IISerpent is a native IIS module – implemented as a C++ DLL and
configured in the %windir%\system32\inetsrv\config\ApplicationHost.config file. That way,
IISerpent secures both persistence and execution, as all IIS modules are loaded by the IIS
4/11

Worker Processes (w3wp.exe) and used to handle inbound HTTP requests.
We don’t have any information about how IISerpent’s operators initially penetrate IIS
servers, but we know that administrative privileges are required to configure it as a native
IIS module, which reduces the number of plausible scenarios. A configuration weakness or
vulnerability in a web application or the server are likely culprits.
As with all native IIS modules, IISerpent exports a function called RegisterModule (see
Figure 3), which implements the module initialization. The core malicious functionality is
hidden in its event handlers – methods of the module class (inherited from CHttpModule)
that are called on certain server events. More specifically, IISerpent’s code class overrides
its OnBeginRequest and OnSendResponse methods, which means that the malware’s
handlers will be called every time the IIS server starts processing a new inbound HTTP
request, and every time it sends the response buffer.

Figure 3. IISerpent’s DLL exports

IISerpent parses the incoming requests and uses its complex configuration data to
manipulate content served to search engine crawlers. As Table 1 lists in full, the
configuration includes fields such as a redirect URL, or a list of backlinks to be injected. The
attackers can display or update the malware’s configuration by sending any HTTP request
to the compromised IIS server with the query parameter ?DisplayModuleConfig=1 or ?
ReloadModuleConfig=1, respectively, in the request URI.
Upon receiving the update request, IISerpent obtains the configuration from the C&C server
by sending an HTTP GET request to this URL:
http://sb.qrfy[.]net/mconfig/<host>.xml
The value <host> is taken from the original attacker request, and it is probably used as a
victim ID. The libcurl library is used for the network communication.

If these values are set, the malware will redirect all crawler requests
to the configured URL via an HTTP 301 response.

redirecturl

If these values are set, the malware will forward the search engine
crawler requests to its C&C server, and replace the HTTP response
with the obtained data, instead of redirecting the crawlers to a
malicious URL directly.

If these values are set, the malware will add all of them as backlinks
to the response for any HTTP request with the strings spider or bot in
the User-Agent header.

IISerpent recognizes search engine crawler requests by parsing the User-Agent header and
looking for specific substrings, as seen in Figure 4. If the redirecturl field is configured, the
malware redirects all requests with the strings spider or bot in the User-Agent header to this
URL by setting the Location header in the HTTP response. The HTTP status is set to 301
(“Moved Permanently”).

Figure 4. IISerpent recognizes search engine crawler requests by parsing the User-Agent header

If proxymode is set, instead of redirecting the crawlers to a malicious URL, IISerpent
forwards the crawler request to its C&C server proxyurl, and replaces the HTTP response
body with the acquired data. This is applied to all the HTTP requests with spider, bot or
baidu.com/ in the Referer header, or optionally to requests with the strings Android or
AppleWebKit in the Referer header. Additionally, the malware can be configured to:
Only handle those HTTP requests where the IIS server has set the response status to
404
Ignore requests coming from a configurable list of banned IP addresses
Finally, IISerpent can have a list of links configured and add these links to the HTTP
response body for any search engine crawler requests. These links are added as HTML
entities to the existing HTTP response body:
<a href=’/<link><timestamp1>_<timestamp2>_<randomId>.html’></a>

IISerpent is not the only known malicious IIS module with SEO fraud capabilities – out of
the 14 malware families we analyzed for our paper Anatomy of native IIS malware, six have
support for SEO fraud techniques. In these families, the SEO fraud functionality is often
bundled with other malicious capabilities (such as backdoor support, or serving malicious
content to legitimate website visitors).
While we first detected IISerpent in May 2021, we were able to trace the SEO fraud
phenomenon to the first publicly known case in 2019, when Secpulse published an incident
report in Chinese on unnamed malware affecting IIS servers. The analysis of that malware
and its SEO fraud capabilities is featured in our white paper under the Group 9 category.
The various SEO fraud families that we analyzed differ in the unethical SEO techniques
supported, and target a wide range of search engine crawlers – specified in the clear
(Group 12 in the paper, as shown in Figure 5), as an encrypted list (Group 9), or obtained
on the fly by querying DNS TXT records of the C&C server hostname (Group 11). All these
families are detected by ESET security solutions as Win32/BadIIS.

Conclusion
IISerpent is a malicious IIS module with unusual targets and purpose, designed to aid in
shady practices aimed at boosting the page rank of third-party websites. Even though it
doesn’t affect legitimate visitors of the compromised server, it nevertheless still deserves
attention for distorting search results, and its potential for monetization.
On top of hijacking the reputation of the compromised websites, IISerpent can be a cause
for headaches for the digital marketers, as any website participating in unethical SEO
practices can be penalized by search engine algorithms. The best bet to prevent a
compromise by IISerpent (and other IIS malware) is keeping your IIS servers up to date,
and being careful not to download IIS extensions from untrusted sources – be especially
aware of modules promising too-good-to-be-true features such as magically improving
SEO. For additional protection, consider using a web application firewall, and/or a security
solution on your IIS server.
