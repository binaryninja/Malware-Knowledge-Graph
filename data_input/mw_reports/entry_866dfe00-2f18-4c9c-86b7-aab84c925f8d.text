EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
At the end of 2015 we became aware of an unusual malware program,
discovered in an attempted attack on a bank in Singapore. Analysis of the file
attached to a spear-phishing email that had been sent to the bank revealed
the name of the malware: JSocket. Later on we found that this malware has
many names: Adwind RAT (Remote Access Tool), AlienSpy, Frutas, jFrutas,
Unrecom, Sockrat, JSocket, jRat. The rich features of the malware, including its
ability to run on Windows, Mac OS and Linux, as well as the fact that it was not
detected by any antivirus solution meant that it immediately got our attention.
Adwind is a backdoor available for purchase. It’s written purely in Java which
makes it cross-platform. The backdoor component (called the server) can run
on Windows, Mac OS, Linux and Android platforms, providing capabilities for
remote desktop control, data gathering, data exfiltration and lateral movement.
While it is more often used by opportunistic attackers and distributed
in massive spam campaigns, there are cases where Adwind has been
used in targeted attacks. In August 2015, Adwind popped up in the news
in connection with a cyber-espionage campaign against an Argentinian
prosecutor who had been found dead in January 2015.
Currently the malware is distributed via a software-as-a-service platform
which is based on an online subscription model. This report overviews
the capabilities of the malware, describes its online platform and lists
the cyber-attacks where this malware was used.

THE HISTORY OF ADWIND

Frutas RAT
The story begins in January 2012. A user of the Spanish-speaking hacking
forum “indetectables.net” (the majority of whose users come from Mexico
and South America), going by the name of “adwind”, started a new thread
about the development and testing of a new cross-platform RAT codenamed
“Frutas”, which was fully implemented in Java.

A week later, on 17th January, he announced the first release of the RAT.
Its development was rapid and in late February version 0.4 was released.

Following the release of version 0.8, the Frutas RAT started to gain popularity
in the cybercriminal world, mainly in Spanish-speaking countries.
Version 0.8 was described by Symantec researchers back in February 2013:

However, by that time a more powerful version, 0.9, had already been
released, in September 2012:

The author nicknamed “adwind” worked hard and his efforts resulted
in the release of version 1.0, also in September 2012.

TLP: White

For any inquiries, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com

This was the last release of the Frutas RAT (under this name), although we have
information on at least one additional private build: “JFrutas RAT v1.0 Version
Privada”:

The Adwind RAT
After the release of Frutas 1.0, the author changed the name of the project to
“Adwind RAT”. This was the first but by no means the last “rebranding” of this
malware.
TLP: White

For any inquiries, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com

11

The first variant of the Adwind RAT, version 1.0, seems to have been released
in January 2013, just four months after the final release of Frutas 1.0.

The Adwind RAT gained worldwide attention and quickly became one of
the favorite tools among Arabic-speaking hackers, mostly used in conjunction
with the DarkComet RAT.

The most popular version of Adwind was 2.0, released in May 2013. It had
fresh new look and logo:

One of the screenshots demonstrating the RAT revealed the user’s PC name
which was “adwind”. While IP information was apparently altered by the user,
he forgot to amend or ignored the country name on the following screenshot:

Surprisingly, this variant of Adwind was still around in 2015, due to the freely
redistributable cracked “license” protection in Adwind version 2/3.
Version 3.0 was released in August 2013. The author created a new YouTube
channel to announce the new release and host video tutorials.

TLP: White

For any inquiries, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com

14

Version 3.0 of the Adwind RAT added support for Android OS, and from that
moment Adwind was truly cross-platform, supporting all major OS including
mobile: Windows, Linux, Mac OSX, Android.

TLP: White

For any inquiries, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com

15

Adwind 3.0 also introduced a subscription model with different plans:

In the summer of 2013, Adwind was also being used in targeted attacks around
the world and, for the first time was seen in attacks in the Asia-Pacific region.

TLP: White

For any inquiries, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com

16

Kaspersky Security Network detected Adwind fewer than 2,000 times during
2013, but nearly 70% of all targets were located in just ten countries, with Arabic
and Spanish-speaking countries at the top:

UNRECOM
A second rebranding of the RAT took place in November 2013. The following
note appeared at adwind.com.mx, a website owned by the Adwind developer:

17

It came as a big surprise to Adwind customers and some clarification was
provided by another Mexican hacker nicknamed “faria”, who was a reseller
of the Adwind RAT. Below is a rough computer translation from the original
Spanish:
First of all apologize for taking so long but it was worth .... It is advised to all those who bought
the rat adwind of version 3.0 down the project will be managed by adwind not because they
have received threats and by legal issues, therefore it is removed from the project and has
decided to sell the company called lustrosoft. The company has purchased the adwind has
decided to rename the project is no longer adwind Rat was called. You may wonder who the
hell lustroSoft, well it’s a guy programmer in java, c ++, html etc. Lo means that this guy has
great knowledge, I’ve had the opportunity to talk with him and I think it does work very calidad.
El good to excellent launch of the new software will be starting on Thursday 11/8/2013 that
will bring them more options adwind new ones were added which I can not say that will be
a surprise, besides that comes to fud all antivirus and much more ... For those who bought
a new total adwind reciviran your mind free software depending on whether they bought with
or without android android.
Questions.......
What will happen to my remote that had the 3.0 will be lost? Redirijidos will not be lost to
the new software the handover.
How is the new project called? It is not yet known to be defined.
Will it serve for PC and mobile android? Clearly, if
I continue working with lustroSoft? Yeah I will continue to sell and support to all my clients.
If I want to buy who do I contact? Can they make their turns starting date 11.08.2013 marrow
faria me.
What will be the value of the new software would be paid and where? The value is not fixed aun.
El be sent through paypal, werter Union.
Where I can see the site of the new software? Still under construction then they will be released.
For more information you can add me to fariastreball@hotmail.com saludoss faria att.

Shortly after that, on 12 November 2013, the same “faria” released information
about a new RAT codenamed UNRECOM.

19

UNRECOM (or LustroSoft) also used a subscription based model with different
plans:

The individual nicknamed ”faria” used skype and gmail accounts which revealed
a connection to the distribution of UNRECOM. Considering that he entered the
scene as a person related to the distribution of Adwind, we believe that he is
probably a friend or partner of the original Adwind author.

TLP: White

For any inquiries, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com

UNRECOM version 1.3 was cracked by hacker Boredliner
(boredliner.wordpress.com) in February 2014 and released to the public.

TLP: White

For any inquiries, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com

21

The same software cracker (“Boredliner”) released a cracked version of
Adwind 3.0 in February 2014:

Software protection was based on license number and hardware checks.
One of new features of this variant of Adwind was a commercial obfuscation
tool known as Allatori which is used for Java bytecode obfuscation.

To check the serial number, Adwind established a connection to adwind.com.mx,
which had to be resolved to a hardcoded IP: 65.99.225.111

TLP: White

For any inquiries, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com

22

This cracked version of Adwind 3.0 was the main and most widely used variant
of Adwind in targeted attacks based on Adwind during 2014-2015.
The next version of UNRECOM (2.0) was released in March 2014.

By the summer of 2014 there were two Java-based RATs circulating in
the cybercriminal world, based on the same source code – Adwind v.2/3
(cracked) and UNRECOM (with “new owner”, also cracked).

23

AlienSpy
Obviously, the availability of free, cracked variants of the RAT caused a decline
in sales that disturbed the author (regardless of how he was connected to
UNRECOM) and his response was the introduction of a new “rebranded” RAT
in September-October 2014: AlienSpy RAT.
The first known and widely distributed versions were 4.0, 4.1 and 4.2,
with the latest released in October 2014.

For any inquiries, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com

25

Some versions of AlienSpy were also cracked and used by cybercriminals,
but, as we explained earlier, most of them relied on free Adwind or UNRECOM.
This and previous facts were the reason behind the increased number of
targeted attacks using this RAT.

Targeted email sample (image courtesy of contagiodump)

In April 2015, Fidelis published the first detailed report on AlienSpy, based on
known cases from dozens of attacks against US companies.
“Fidelis researchers have observed AlienSpy being sold in the cyberunderground via a subscription model, with prices starting at $9.90 for 15-day
use to $219.90 for an annual subscription. The subscription provides users with
access to the malware’s complete range of capabilities, including some newer
techniques like sandbox detection, antivirus tool disablement, and Transport
Layer Security (TLS) encryption-protected command-and-control capabilities.”
If you compare the prices quoted for AlienSpy with those for UNRECOM,
it appears that short-term subscriptions for the new “brand” were cheaper
(starting at just $9.90), but an annual subscription was more expensive
($219.9 vs $200 for unlimited use of UNRECOM).

TLP: White

For any inquiries, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com

27

The Fidelis report was focused on the last known variant of AlienSpy –
version 5.1. Code analysis revealed a lot of functions from UNRECOM
(meaning that it was based on this RAT, not Adwind).
The authentication server for AlienSpy was located at alienspy.net, registered
in June 2014. However, the domain was suspended by GoDaddy after the
Fidelis report – and the business of the AlienSpy author was ruined again.
After just two months, in June 2015, the fifth reincarnation of Frutas was
born – this time under the name it is still known by today: the “JSocket RAT”.

THE LATEST REINCARNATION
OF THE MALWARE
JSocket.org: malware-as-a‑service
JSocket.org is a website that implements a concept known as malware-asa‑service, which is a commercially available malware tool that can be used
on a subscription basis, and which includes basic technical support, additional
paid components and modules, as well as accompanying services such as
obfuscation to evade AV detection, a free VPN service for members with
the ability to map ports for incoming connections at the VPN termination
point and free checks using tens of different AV engines.
The project runs openly as if it were providing completely legitimate products
and services for benign purposes. It uses common online marketing methods
to advertise the capabilities of its malware and the various techniques
available for stealing information.

TLP: White

For any inquiries, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com

28

The website is hosted or proxied via 37.61.235.30, an IP that belongs to LayerIP
UK, a mysterious hosting company for which we couldn’t find a public website.

Registration
As of January 2016, JSocket registration is open to everyone. To register you
have to provide a valid email address which will be validated after initial sign
up. Some of the additional features, such as the VPN service and additional
downloads are only available to registered users.

TLP: White

For any inquiries, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com

29

Online malware shop
The users who successfully complete the registration process get access to
the online shop where they may purchase a subscription plan for the JSocket
RAT, and buy additional components and services. Below are the membership
plans available to registered users.

TLP: White

For any inquiries, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com

30

Additional, paid-for, standalone components are as follows:

The online shop offers the following methods for the transfer of money:
1. PerfectMoney
This internet payment system offers a number of ways to deposit funds in
its virtual account, including via a bank wire transfer, Bitcoin, cash terminals
and a variety of e-currencies.

TLP: White

For any inquiries, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com

31

2. CoinPayments
This payment processing service supports 49 cryptocurrencies including
the most popular, Bitcoin and Lightcoin.
3. Advcash
This is an electronic currency and e-wallet service with a large number of
exchange opportunities, including cryptocurrencies.
4. EntroMoney
Yet another payment system with a large number of exchanges supported,
mostly from Nigeria.

YouTube channel
The owner of JSocket runs a YouTube channel for malware users. This carries
educational videos on how to build malware and how to make use of JSocket
services while using the Adwind RAT.
By the end of 2015 the channel carried six videos.

TLP: White

For any inquiries, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com

32

According to an analysis of the video content, the creator of the videos,
who is also the supposed owner of the JSocket website uses the Spanish
version of Microsoft Windows 10 with a number of virtual machines running
on VMWare. The author of the videos has the local time zone set to UTC-5.

Profitability
JSocket.org offers six types of memberships ranging from 15 days to a one
year subscription term which cost from $25 USD to $300 USD respectively.
In December the website had more than 1,600 registered users. The estimated
annual revenue of this online project is about $200,000 USD.

LATEST KNOWN ADWIND ATTACKS
At the end of 2015, the Adwind RAT was used to attack banks outside of
Singapore, such as the Ajman bank in the United Arab Emirates, Bangkok
Bank, the IBC Bank (USA), the Nordic financial services group Nordea,
headquartered in Sweden, and possibly Bank Negara Malaysia.

TLP: White

For any inquiries, please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com

33

Another attack that was discovered via an Adwind email sample uploaded
to VirusTotal revealed an attempt to attack a major bank in Russia. Although
the actor behind that attack seems unrelated to the original attack, the trend
to target banks via direct emails to employees seems to be on the rise.

An email sent to a major bank in the Russian Federation

Adwind was used in another reported attack in November 2015, which centred
on a spear-phishing email campaign sent on behalf of the UAE Police Force and
carrying a warning about a terror threat.

We found another example of an “on behalf of Police” attack, also in November
but from the “Commissariat de Police” in Belgium.

At the end 2015 we observed some attacks based on the theme of “shipping”
instead of “money transfer”.

Malware Hunter Finds Spyware Used Against Dead Argentine Prosecutor
WRITTEN BY LORENZO FRANCESCHI-BICCHIERAI
August 6, 2015 // 07:50 AM EST

That name, “estrictamente secreto y confidencial.pdf.jar,” [strictly secret
and confidential.pdf.jar] was enough to provide Marquis-Boire with a lead.
He searched for it on Virus Total, an online repository where anyone can
upload files to see if they’re detected as malicious by different anti-viruses,
and found it.
“This file matches one sample, and one sample only,” Marquis-Boire said
during the talk.
During our research we analyzed about 200 different examples of Adwind
attacks covering the period November 2015-January 2016. We were able
to identify about 60 different targets of these attacks and extract about
150 samples of Adwind (see related C2s and some hashes in the Appendix.)
Most of the recipients fall into the category of financial organisations and
manufacturing/engineering. We also found some government-(or -state)
owned targets.

KSN statistics
Of course, the 200 analyzed email messages represent just the tip of the iceberg.
Every Adwind attack in November-January was massive and infected messages
were sent to thousands of targets.
Based on KSN data we were able to uncover the real picture. We checked all
MD5s from the attacks described above that had been detected by Kaspersky
products and reported to KSN.

INFECTION VECTORS
Adwind was distributed in November 2015 to a number of banks in Singapore in
the form of an email attachment. It was reported that the email had been sent
on behalf of another bank located in Malaysia (faking the email ‘From’ field).
At the end of 2015 we became aware of new propagation method for Adwind
samples, based on obfuscated HTA files with VBScript+JScript (sample
5a7b277e2202d308f1a755505d113986) which downloaded and silently installed
a full Java Runtime Environment if the target host didn’t have it. Related URLs:

CASE STUDY OF A TARGETED ATTACK
Point of entry
In November 2015 we received an email text and JAR attachment
(MD5: e8388a2b7d8559c6f0f27ca91d004c7c) which had been sent to a bank
in Singapore. It was reported that the email has come on behalf of another
bank located in Malaysia (faking the email ‘From’ field).
We requested and analysed the email headers, which revealed the real source
to be the email address (alst@alst.ru) and IP (31.31.196.31). The email header is

We believe that the owner of alst.ru was not aware of or involved in the
malware campaign. According to open source intelligence, the website
belongs to a small software development company ООО “Альянс-Софт”
in the Russian Federation. When contacted, the company owner agreed
to cooperate and help with our investigation. We were provided with
background information and access credentials to the compromised server in
order to conduct our own analysis. The owner claimed that the website had
been experiencing trouble with malware for more than a year. It had been
blacklisted by Kaspersky AV and Google for spreading malware.
The website used to run on a shared hosting platform provided by reg.ru.
Unfortunately the preservation settings for logs were set to just seven days. This
prevented us from seeing access logs for the dates when the emails were sent.
We have checked the website and while there were security misconfigurations,
old backups of a database, some older scripts and even a php-script
that allowed passwords for a website CMS to be reset to a default one
without authentication, there was no visible trace of web backdoors.

In addition we found that the website had definitely been compromised
and used for spreading malware in the past. For example we found Jobs.apk
(MD5 6ff5e6acb43c0bcbfd649004e96aa6d3) that was detected by 31 of 57 AV
engines according to VirusTotal (Kaspersky: Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.Opfake.a).
However, that malware is not related to the Adwind platform.
The web resource had more than 10 mailboxes bound to domain alst.ru. All mail
was sent via mail.alst.ru (31.31.196.31). The server required authentication and
the password for alst@alst.ru was not empty, so it seemed that the attacker had
the credentials. On the date of our check (24.11.2015) the alst@alst.ru mailbox
was disabled.

VirusTotal activity analysis
Analysis of the files submitted to VirusTotal revealed that the file was first seen
on 2015-11-12 03:42:13. The activity log on VirusTotal indicated that the same

The code of the JSocket backdoor remains obfuscated even after
the unwrapping of several of layers of protection. It uses a feature of JAR/ZIP
archives to store case-sensitive filenames, which means that the JAR archive
was most likely created on a non-Windows system. Many tools for the Windows
platform will fail to extract or analyze such an archive, because it contains several
filenames which differ only in the upper case and lower case representation of
the same name:

Java class names consisting of upper and lowercase “i” characters

According to the JSocket developer, the server component of the RAT supports
agents running on Windows, Linux, Mac and Android OS.

The main JAR file pushed to the victim is a generic loader of additional
components, which extend functionality of the backdoor upon command
from the attacker. This made the server part of the Java backdoor unusually
small (less than 130Kb).

Command & Control infrastructure
igbankwuruns.no-ip.info (resolved to 5.254.106.216 (RO) according to malwr.com,
used to be resolved to 180.74.97.18 (MY)). Coincidentally this address matched the
sender IP from the email header.
Based on pDNS analysis 5.254.106.216 was related to the following domains:
•

broadband.ddns.net

•

dellboy12.ditchyourip.com

•

emenike.no-ip.info

Below is the summary list of IPs where these domains used to resolve.
If grouped by countries they are mostly in Nigeria, Great Britain (leased to
Romanian ISP Voxility) and Malaysia.

According to our pDNS records , the IP from Malaysia 180.74.97.18 is related
to the following additional domain: egombute.duckdns.org
At the time of checking (on 26 November 2015) port 9996 at 180.74.97.18
was open, which may indicate that it is a real host used by the attacker.

Link to JSocket.org
According to the mode of operation, the backdoor’s administrative software
(client) first connects to JSocket.org to verify the user’s subscription.
This software is available for purchase and is not available for download by
non-customers. The website JSocket.org allows people to register and to
obtain some information about other registered users. We have checked
a couple of unique strings that were used by the attacker and discovered that
there is a registered user called egombute. On 26 Nov 2015 we received the
following information via https://jsocket.org/page/profile/egombute/ page:

The time above is in the local time zone of the web server which is UTC-5.
So far, we can conclude that the individual calling himself Ego Mbute is
connected to the initial attack against banks in Singapore.
Also, we were able to find another attack from that person in September 2015.
The original dropper of the sample is RTF file “MoneyLaunderingLetter.doc”
(MD5 1f14bd3706f22ae03b42510940692c50) with Exploit.CVE-2012-0158.
This malicious document was sent to dozens (or probably hundreds) of victims
around the world. According to VirusTotal, the document was uploaded for
analysis 110 times from 89 sources between 14 September and 13 October.

The dropper tried to connect to previewproperty.co.uk (109.108.143.46).
This domain did not represent the final stage of the operation. It was used
as a Command & Control server; and not only in this case – we found more
samples of the dropper:

It also downloads the hawkEye keylogger as “freshnow.exe” from emenike.no-ip.
info. The keylogger also tries to download additional data and executables from
104.27.137.248:80 (serv.hfsoft.xyz) and 209.160.26.176:80 (www.prachiths.com).

Attribution
From the use of language in the email sent by the attacker we can conclude
that he is either not a native speaker or, if this is their national language,
might originate from a less-developed region.
The ZIP directory timestamp is stored in the local user time zone. Since the
email was sent at 11:10 SGT and some of the most recent files were prepared
at 10:05 (in the attacker’s time zone) we may conclude that the attacker most
probably operated in UTC+7 or UTC+8.
A string used in a nickname field in the malware configuration file
was “Baba‑MyGod--Too-Much” (another sample contains similar string
“Baba‑God--Too-Much”). This seems to be a reference to a popular African
gospel song, available on YouTube here and here.
The domain “emenike.no-ip.info” used by the attacker is most likely a reference
to the famous Nigerian soccer player Emmanuel Chineye Emenike.

In addition, we found that emenike.no-ip.info has been spotted in another

According to a Reuters publication in 2014 as of March 2014, according
to the ministry of education there were 9,146 Nigerians on student visas
in Malaysia, out of a total 123,000 overseas students.
“Hundreds of American women are being ensnared by Internet scammers
based in Malaysia, with some losing over a quarter of a million dollars,
as the country becomes an epicenter for online crime perpetrated by Africans,
U.S. officials say.
The mostly Nigerian conmen, who enter Malaysia on student visas, take
advantage of the country’s good Internet infrastructure to prey on lonely,
middle-aged women, wooing them on dating websites before swindling their
savings, they said.
The scams are more sophisticated than most Nigeria-based operations which most Internet users have experienced at some time either via email
or advertising - helped by Malaysia’s advanced banking system, which allows
perpetrators to quickly set up accounts and receive international transfers.”

CONCLUSIONS
Based on the initial attack against banks in Singapore, we have discovered
that a suspect behind this attack is most likely located in Malaysia while having
Nigerian origins. The miscreant is definitely involved in targeted attacks with
a major focus on financial institutions, using various techniques to reach
the target. In September 2015, the attacker used spear-phishing emails
with attached MS Word documents that exploited a patched vulnerability in
Microsoft Office. In November of that year, the same attacker tried to hit the
targets again using a Java backdoor. The attacker is not an advanced threat
actor as indicated by the habit of reusing the same email message template
again and again, relying on a patched, three-year old MS Office vulnerability
and commercially available malware tools such as the Adwind RAT.
Nevertheless, the threat coming from this actor has not yet been eradicated
and his recurring attempts to attack various banks using new infection vectors
are likely to continue, with the next attempt imminent.
Despite several attempts to take down and stop the Adwind developers from
distributing the malware, Adwind has survived for years and has been through
rebranding and operational expansion that ranged from the provision of
additional plugins for the malware to its own obfuscation tool and a even
a warrant for FUD (fully undetected malware) to customers. The success of
this commercial backdoor was so high that it inevitably led to the growth of
malware resellers and copycats.

While the concept of malware written in Java isn’t new, the usage of multiple
malware encryptors and obfuscators as well as unpacking in memory and
a lack of full Java emulators (with the huge collection of classes that Java
requires) in AV products makes this malware successful at passing through
enterprise security fences.
A simple infection vector based on an email with an attached JAR file is rather
unique and unexpected. One of the reason why the attackers choose banks
as targets may be the popularity of the Java platform in financial institutions
as well as the attractive opportunity of a large-scale bank cyber -heist.
The malware depends on having Java runtime installed, which is more likely
to be the case for enterprise users rather than typical home users.
It is recommended that the Java platform is disabled or fully uninstalled from
the system unless it is used. In case of a dependency on the Java platform it
is recommended that modern and updated security software is used and that
the email filters are configured to block messages containing attached JAR files.

For large organizations or users with basic experience, one simple trick may
help to prevent accidental infection of the system with such JAR-based
malware: changing the default handler for the JAR file extension. This can
be achieved with two clicks in Windows or distributed via registry settings in
a large corporate network.

Replacing the default JAR file handler application with, for instance, Windows
Notepad will not only protect users from running malicious JARs but may also
create enough confusion from encountering gibberish text to call the system
administrator and bring a strange attachment to their attention.
Adwind was and is an example of successful, widespread malware which runs
on any platform. This malware set the bar for other malware writers who will
most likely try to extend their support to other platforms in the future.
As of January 2016, the website JSocket.org was still up and running.
Apparently a domain or server takedown strategy doesn’t work against prolific
projects like this. The most efficient way is prosecution of the malware writers
and their customers.
