Earlier today someone forwarded me (outside of work) a threat intelligence “report” – quotes
because it was far from being a finished product – that was recommending that people
impacted by one of those three nation-state actors should be communicated as “Russia
targeting your organization”. I found this assessment dangerously wrong and inaccurate
so let me explain here why and maybe my post will help others avoid similar
oversimplifications.
I cannot reference classified attribution intelligence products, but one of the most reputable
public sources is Välisluureamet, Estonia’s foreign intelligence service. In Välisluureamet’s
2018 unclassified report they attributed those groups to specific organizations within the
Russian Federation government. So let’s assume that this is accurate for the sake of this
blog post.

Why is it dangerously wrong to communicate that getting targeted by APT28, APT29 or
Turla is “Russia targeting you” rather than the specific actors? Simply because they are
significantly different organizations, with different modus operandi, different objectives, and
different TTPs. This means that your threat model will be entirely different if you want to be
protected against APT28 versus Turla or APT29. To be more precise…
APT28 (GRU’s 6th Directorate/Military Intelligence)
A military intelligence agency is usually after intelligence of military value. Specifically this
agency has shown that they are one of the most active actors in cyber with massive
resources but not extremely sophisticated. Of course, when there are big geopolitical events,
military research, investigations on Russian military activities or military exercises they will be
around, and they will be after any connected systems that can get them military intelligence

that could benefit the Russian Federation and its allies. They have been seen using all
intelligence disciplines without any noticeable preference on cyber over other means of
collection.
APT29 (SVR/Foreign Intelligence)
This is the equivalent of the CIA for Russia and just like the CIA, their cyber operations are
typically more on the targeted and less on the bulk collection. In numerous occasions they
have been seen conducting close access operations, and their objectives typically are
related to political and economical information. For example, finding dirt to recruit someone
as an SVR agent or finding out the details of a commercial agreement or research that could
benefit the Russian state or its allies. They are less in the SIGINT and more in the HUMINT
space so they are more likely to recruit an insider to get them what they want than perform
an extremely sophisticated cyber operation.
Turla (FSB’s 16th Center/Signals Intelligence)
Turla is the equivalent of the NSA’s Signals Intelligence Directorate (SID) and because of
that, they are one of the most sophisticated cyber actors out there operating at a level similar
to that of the NSA, including bulk collection. This means that they collect intelligence for a
variety of agencies both for Russia but also Russia’s allies under various agreements. So
their target space is massive and they are the most advanced cyber operators of the Russian
government. They have a massive organization and their sole purpose is SIGINT. So if you
are targeted by Turla then expect some very advanced and complex cyber operations. Also,
if you are targeted by Turla it doesn’t mean that it’s Russia targeting you, it could be that they
execute an intelligence collection agreement for an ally of Russia that doesn’t have such
cyber intelligence collection capabilities, similarly to what the NSA’s SID and other large
SIGINT agencies do.
And this is why oversimplifying in a threat intelligence product that any of the above actors
should be treated as simply “Russia is after you” is dangerous for cyber security
departments/customers that have to develop defensive controls to protect their assets.
If you are unsure about the attribution it’s better to stay away from attributing it at all until
you have sufficient evidence, and focus on the lower level indicators and warnings that you
can share to help defenders take some action. For example, what did you observe in terms
of TTPs or even IOCs. It’s better to share high confidence intelligence than “it’s the
Russians” that has zero practical application to develop protections without more context that
can help in understanding the motivations and intentions.
The same applies if you are a briefer delivering those threat intelligence products, choose
your words wisely. Finally, do not forget that some of those agencies collaborate on certain
projects including sharing some software tools, libraries and TTPs (typically through lessonslearned sessions and internal policies).
Hopefully that clears it out…
