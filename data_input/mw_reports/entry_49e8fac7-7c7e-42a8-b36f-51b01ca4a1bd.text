A new custom malware dubbed SockDetour found on systems belonging to US defense
contractors has been used as a backup backdoor to maintain access to compromised
networks.
The malicious payload was spotted by Unit 42 security researchers, who believe that its
operators kept the backdoor under the radar for a long time as it has been used in the wild
since at least July 2019.
SockDetour's stealthiness can be explained by the fact that it "operates filelessly and
socketlessly" on infected Windows servers by hijacking network connections, making it a lot
harder to detect at the host and network levels.

The connection hijacking is done using the legitimate Microsoft Detours library package used
for Windows API call monitoring and instrumentation.
"With such implementation, SockDetour [..] serves as a backup backdoor in case the primary
backdoor is detected and removed by defenders," Unit 42 explained.
In one of the attacks, the threat actors also used a very specific delivery server, a QNAP
network-attached storage (NAS) device typically used by small businesses and previously
infected with QLocker ransomware — they likely exploited the same security flaw (the CVE2021-28799 remote code execution bug) to gain access to the server.

SockDetour backdoor workflow (Unit 42)
The researchers first spotted the malware being deployed onto the Windows server of at
least one US defense contractor on July 27, 2021, which led to the discovery of three other
defense orgs being targeted by the same group with the same backdoor.
"Based on Unit 42’s telemetry data and the analysis of the collected samples, we believe the
threat actor behind SockDetour has been focused on targeting U.S.-based defense
contractors using the tools," the researchers revealed.
"Unit 42 has evidence of at least four defense contractors being targeted by this campaign,
with a compromise of at least one contractor."

The Chinese connection
The SockDetour backdoor is used in attacks by an APT activity cluster tracked by Unit 42 as
TiltedTemple and previously linked to attacks exploiting several vulnerabilities in Zoho
products, including ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus (CVE-2021-40539) and ServiceDesk
Plus (CVE-2021-44077).

While the company did not attribute the SockDetour malware to a specific hacking group,
Unit 42 researchers suspected in November that the TiltedTemple campaign is the work of a
Chinese-sponsored threat group tracked as APT27.
The partial attribution is based on tactics and malicious tools matching APT27's previous
activity and similar targeting of the same range of industry sectors (e.g., defense, technology,
energy, aerospace, government, and manufacturing) for cyber espionage.
TiltedTemple attacks focused on Zoho vulnerabilities led to the breach of networks belonging
to critical infrastructure orgs organizations worldwide in three different campaigns throughout
2021, using:
an ADSelfService zero-day exploit between early-August and mid-September,
an n-day AdSelfService exploit until late October,
and a ServiceDesk one starting with October 25.
