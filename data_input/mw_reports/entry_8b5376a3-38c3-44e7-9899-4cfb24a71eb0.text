ABSTRACT
With the advancement of defensive cybersecurity practices and
the regular release of reports exposing toolsets used in APT
attacks, advanced threat actors have had to adapt. However,
while APT reports should have threat actors scrambling to keep
up, in reality they are providing APT actors with the information
they need to implement new operational security practices and
technologies that have defenders working as hard as ever to
protect their networks. Not only are attackers adapting; they are
evolving at a faster rate than defenders. So what are we, as
defenders, doing wrong?
The fact is, many public APT reports suck. Even though they
tend to be long and technical, they are often not full reports, but
rather a commentary on the attack platform(s) and deployment
technique(s) used, intended for PR purposes. This results in an
asymmetry – an information gap – that benefits the attacker.
Current APT reports basically act as free Q&A for APT actors,
providing them with valuable information about defenders’
insights into their tools and actions. As a result, APT actors are
able to adapt their own OPSEC practices and technologies in
order to stay one step ahead of defenders. APT reports in their
current state are more beneficial to attackers than defenders.
Currently, most APT reports provide abundant information on
indicators of compromise (IOC), C&C set-up and malware used.
This presentation examines actual techniques that can be used to
re-engineer the entire attack process, including how attackers
decide what information is valuable to target, where that
information can be found, how they create a target report and then
attack plan, and the ongoing concerns of an attacker during lateral
movement (i.e. OPSEC, intelligence gathering, and keeping their
identity hidden). Based on these techniques, we discuss specific
defensive countermeasures that can be used. If APT reports
included more actionable intelligence that defenders could use to
create better defence practices, their value would then be greater
to defenders than to attackers. We discuss how intelligence on the
attack vector of an APT, or on what information was
compromised, is actually more valuable to a defender than the
information that currently dominates APT reports (malware
analysis, IOCs). APT reports with more actionable intelligence
would afford us the ability to publicly re-engineer specific
attacks, consequently rendering useless certain attack techniques
that are currently not available for public knowledge.

The cybersecurity sector needs to demand earlier reporting of
breaches (or at least a heads up to the security community),
actionable public information sharing, and a move away from
our current fixation on attribution. We need to make hackers
spend significantly more time, effort, and resources in order to
succeed. By producing better APT reports, not only can the
security community increase attackers’ costs and cause them to
constantly be on guard, but also significantly disrupt the
attackers’ operations and make it difficult for them to rebuild
their attack infrastructure after being compromised and exposed.
The bottom line is: in order to counter the evolution of APTs, we
need APT reports that provide a more wholesome view of an
attacker’s motivations and chosen vector in addition to an
analysis of his techniques. This shift in focus can give security
professionals more tools to successfully re-engineer an attacker’s
methodology.
There is an information gap in that APT reports are more
helpful to the attacker than to the defender – there needs to be
a shift.
Cybersecurity is a constantly evolving field, with protection
technologies shifting to keep up with the transformation of cyber
threats that are growing in complexity. Operational security,
otherwise known as OPSEC, is a collection of processes both for
developing software with risk management in mind, as well as
carrying out a mission using said software. In the case of a
network breach, OPSEC also includes the measures used by the
attacker to avoid detection, and ensure success. Contrary to what
some might believe, operational security is useful for both the
attacker and the defender. When considering operational security
from the perspective of an attacker, OPSEC can be utilized in
order to achieve the attacker’s goals while preventing detection.
There are instances, however, when OPSEC is a hindrance. In
terms of the time needed to achieve success, it often necessitates
slow movement on the attacker’s part in order not to be
compromised. OPSEC’s scalability can also be problematic, as
can the ease of deployment.
Over the past 10 years, a specific type of threat known as an
‘advanced persistent threat’, or APT, has become increasingly
common. As a result, defence technology has been transforming
in order to meet these kinds of threats. Some of the most notable
breaches and hacks in the past few years have been a result of
APT campaigns, such as Stuxnet and Flame. These two
campaigns actually varied in size and specification. Stuxnet was
a computer worm, believed to be a joint American-Israeli project,
that compromised Iranian centrifuges. In this instance, the worm
was smaller in size but designed to target specific vendors.
Flame, on the other hand, was much larger – 20 megabytes in
comparison to Stuxnet’s 500 kilobytes – but much less targetspecific. Its main purpose was to infect a system and look for
intelligence, by taking screenshots and recording audio and then
sending that information back through an encrypted channel.
When APTs are identified and blocked, it is often the result of a
hacker being compromised by faulty operational security. On
the attacker’s side, this requires a transformation in product. For
instance, after Stuxnet and Flame were identified, new advanced
persistent threats became stealthier and more complex. One

example is Gauss, which had tight execution constraints which
only allowed the malware to execute on certain targets,
resulting in it evading capture for significantly longer. Even
now, there is still a piece of the malware, detailing which
computer it was meant for, that remains encrypted. Another
APT that emerged as the actors learned from their mistakes was
APT3, a piece of malware that, when first active, used only
small and disposable tools before bringing out the more
complex and intense tools, in order to prevent their loss in the
event of it being caught earlier on.
On the defender’s side, the first significant sign of hope in
defeating APTs came in early 2013 when the first major APT
report was released by Mandiant [1]. Its disclosure of the
advanced persistent threat campaign named ‘APT1’ made a
huge impact thanks to the extent of the exposure. The report
showed that the campaign had compromised 141 companies
across 20 countries. The attack methodology was to establish
access to a network and visit the network every so often to steal
new data. With a sizable staff, APT1 was able to steal incredible
amounts of data, remaining in one particular system for as long
as four years and 10 months, and stealing a whopping 6.5
Terabytes of data from just one organization over the course of
10 months. Mandiant’s report outed APT1 publicly for the first
time and, since then, APT reports have become a common
outcome after an attack, produced with the intent of aiding other
defenders by detailing the attack methods and preventative
measures. Unfortunately, many of these APT reports are failing
to achieve just that. The major problem with these reports is not
ill intent, but a gap in information which causes the details to
favour the attacker rather than the defender.
This disparity occurs for a number of reasons, but all with the
same consequence. Most APT reports are lengthy, causing
readers to have to sift through a great amount of detail in order
to get to the most important piece information. Sometimes, that
information is contained within the report, but sometimes it is
not and the report is not disclosed in full. In these cases, the part
of the report that is publicized is done so for PR purposes and
the full report is available only to paying customers. This is a
clear cut case of when the attacker is disproportionately
benefited because the part of the report that is available often
only contains deployment techniques. Deployment techniques,
for other attackers reading the report, represent nothing more
than an inside look at ‘what the other guy can do’, with less
relevance to any other defenders.
An in-depth analysis of the information commonly contained in
APT reports produced the observation shown in Figure 1.
Most of the information is malware analysis, which makes for
interesting reading for fellow malware researchers but has very
little value to an IT security person trying to defend a network.
After that come indicators of compromise, which actually are
useful for detecting and mitigating threats but have a very short
relevance term, since the rise of OPSEC. Coming next, the C&C
set-up has more relevance as its life span is usually longer
(though less and less relevant to other targets or other
campaigns). Attack vectors are very important because they are
harder to change, are relevant to a larger group of targets, and
are actionable – you have something to defend against – but
these are not often included in the reports. And the most

important piece of information – attacker objectives, the one
thing that lets a defender focus and concentrate the defences in
the right place – is rarely shared.
Moreover, preventative strategies are released, which become in
essence a free lesson for the actor responsible for the advanced
persistent threat, showcasing what should be done differently
next time, with a detailed explanation of the defence software,
essentially allowing the attack mechanisms to evolve and
infiltrate the system more successfully.
For other attackers, these reports represent a free QA process,
leaking both other attacking technologies as well as how they
are defended against, resulting in APT evolution. There are
several instances of seemingly unrelated campaigns having been
carried out using similar code, demonstrating that there was
some spread of information on the actors’ end. In the case of
APT1, different parts of the malware were registered under the
same name and email. This lesson was clearly absorbed by the
Russian programmers who created Turla, an APT which was far
more sophisticated and used satellite connections to hijack
networks and steal data, without any locations disclosed.
In order to fix this information asymmetry, one of the best
solutions is to use ‘reverse engineering’; this essentially means
looking at an attack from the attacker’s perspective in order to
determine what can be done on the defender’s part. This is
where the Cyber Engagement Process comes into play. This is a
simplified model that details the generalized main steps of an
attacker: composing intelligence requirements; creating a target
list; engagement, whether it be pre-breach, post-breach, or
ongoing; and finally folding and retreat.
The first step, composing intelligence requirements, requires a
deep look at the attacker’s end as to what kind of information he
is looking for. This step is quite problematic for defenders. In
the event the defender manages to determine the objective of the
attacker, some precautions can be used. For instance, in the case
of Operation Aurora, security experts were able to determine
that the goal of the attackers was to gain access to particular
source code repositories at certain high tech and security
companies. However, in most cases, there is no indication of the
attackers’ objective or what information is being sought, making

APT REPORTS AND OPSEC EVOLUTION... EVRON & RAZ

defensive strategies much more difficult to select. Even when
the objective is known, it can be difficult to understand the
mindset of the attackers or why they would want certain
information – as in the case of the Office of Personnel
Management breach, when hackers targeted personal
information such as Social Security numbers. For this step, with
little knowledge of the attacker’s intentions, one should perform
risk assessments, to ascertain the potential impacts.
The next step in the Engagement Process is for the attacker to
compile a target list. This is directly related to the intelligence
requirements, as it is nothing more than a list to determine who
has the relevant information as per the intelligence
requirements: ‘Who has the answers to my questions?’ This can
take shape in specific targets, or it can be more broad. From the
defender’s perspective, this again is difficult to act against, for
numerous reasons. Pattern recognition – one of the solutions –
requires more time than is often available. One measure that can
be taken is to constantly be aware of other attacks that are
happening, particularly in companies that are similar to one’s
own. In fact, there are many instances in which one company is
hacked and then, a few days later, a number of other similar
natured companies are breached. In the case of the Target
breach, point-of-sale devices were hacked; any other companies
with similar point-of-sale devices should have been on the
lookout, making active changes to make sure they would not be
hacked in the same fashion. To prevent this, threat assessments
should be carried out often and breaches reported as soon as
possible so that other defenders can take notice and be
forewarned. However, not all actors will include this step as part
of their engagement plan, as this is just a generalized cycle. One
example is the Sofacy APT, which did not have a compiled
target list, but seemed to latch onto whatever information it
could find in order to monetize it later.
The third step of the cycle, intelligence gathering, involves
many substeps. Beforehand, there is generally a pre-prepared
target report outlining everything that is known about the target
to be used during engagement. This helps in the creation of the
attack plan, which might be tailored for the target, with
target-specific tools and target-specific methods. In terms of
attack prevention, publicly available sensitive data poses a huge
problem. Even if the information is not public, some people
may inadvertently make the information easily accessible, for
example by using security questions with answers that can be
found on social media accounts. When there is such a lack of
security awareness, companies can become susceptible to
probing, either automatic or manual. This is merely the
pre-engagement stage of intelligence gathering. Before even
infiltrating an actual network, the attacker can have a large
amount of information at hand. While this seems disheartening,
once an actor is ‘engaged’ and inside the network, there are
actually many opportunities to intervene. The engagement
process is not a one-time event; it is ongoing, which is why
layered security is so important. The key in this step is to put as
many obstacles as possible in the way of the attacker, so that it
takes longer to reach the desired data, resulting in longer
periods of exposure and a greater chance of getting caught.

to the desired data. This is commonly known as ‘lateral
movement’. In order to remain undetected within the network,
more intelligence gathering needs to take place. This is from a
different perspective, having already infiltrated the network, but
this is where operational security needs to be revisited by the
attacker. This begins with mapping out the defences of the target
and continues with looking for other malware. It is also
important to recognize that, in this day and age, there are many
other players and many other APT actors and so there might be
others lurking in the same network that need to be recognized.
With this awareness comes the possibility of having to abort
while inside the network. Even if an installation is in the midst
of occurring, if there are signs of detection, the safest thing to
do is leave the network immediately. This can be seen in the
case of the threat known as ‘Hurricane Panda’ where the threat
actor detected the presence of CrowdStrike and backed away.
This example is closely related to the last step, folding and
retreating, which varies from one attacker to another. Some fold
after report publications: Red October was a malware program
operating for five years before its discovery, upon which it
dismantled. Another program that quit and ran in a similar
fashion was The Mask, which left the system only four hours
after a blog publication. Nevertheless, there are
counter-examples that demonstrate that some malware actors do
not bother to fold and retreat, such as APT12 or the Gaza
Hacker team. For the defender, one of the worst consequences
of an attack could be when an attacker chooses to destroy all the
information he gets his hands on as a form of folding and then
retreating. For this reason, sometimes it can be of more use to
have back-ups of data rather than regular monitoring of the
system.
With this Engagement Process in mind, it is apparent that more
information needs to be communicated in APT reports – and not
just more information, but the right kind of information. One
shift that needs to occur is a reduction in focus on attribution.
While previously, attackers used to try to steer clear of any
possibility of attribution, that no longer seems to be the case.
Instead, attackers seem to have little shame and are not afraid of
attribution. In order to aid not just the actor and other similar
attackers, reports should be focusing on attack vectors and an
analysis of attack techniques. This kind of actionable information
is the only way other defending companies can benefit from
these reports. However, just as important as the actual report
details is the timing of the reports; the public needs to know
about breaches immediately after they happen in order for
defenders to counter future attacks. With more prompt,
actionable reports, the asymmetry of information sharing will
cease and the disproportionate advantages for the attackers will
be negated.
