Since our last research on TA505, we have observed new activity from the group that involves campaigns
targeting different countries over the last few weeks. We found them targeting countries in the Middle East
such as United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, as well as other countries such as India, Japan, Argentina,
the Philippines, and South Korea.
This blog post covers the updates from TA505’s campaigns and indicators of compromise (IoCs), as well as
the latest tactics, techniques, and procedures of these campaigns, particularly those observed in late June. We
also analyzed a new malware tool named Gelup (detected by Trend Micro as Trojan.Win32.GELUP.A),
which we saw the group use in one of the campaigns on June 20.
Gelup abuses user account control (UAC) bypass and works as a loader for other threats. The tool also uses
the packer of FlawedAmmyy, a remote access trojan, from previous campaigns. TA505 is also using
FlowerPippi (Backdoor.Win32.FLOWERPIPPI.A), a new backdoor that we found them using in their
campaigns against targets in Japan, India, and Argentina. Our in-depth analysis of the Gelup malware and
FlowerPippi backdoor, including their infection chains and C&C communication, is detailed in our technical
brief.
Targeting the UAE
TA505 targeted Middle Eastern countries in a June 11 campaign that delivered more than 90% of the total
spam emails to the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Morroco. The spam emails contained either an .html or .xls ﬁle
attachment. The HTML ﬁle leads to a download of another Excel ﬁle embedded with malicious Excel 4.0
macro, which then downloads a FlawedAmmyy downloader (in .msi ﬁle) that leads to the FlawedAmmyy
payload. The direct .xls attachments were equipped with VBA macro. It fetches the same FlawedAmmyy
downloader .msi ﬁle, then downloads the FlawedAmmyy payload. Figure 2 shows the campaign’s infection
chain.

We saw similar campaigns on June 13, but these campaigns also delivered their malware via .doc ﬁles, along
with HTML and Excel ﬁles.

On June 14, we saw TA505’s campaign still targeting UAE with similar tactics and techniques, but this time,
some of the spam emails were delivered via the Amadey botnet. They used Wizard (.wiz) ﬁles in this
campaign, with FlawedAmmyy RAT as the ﬁnal payload.

On June 18, the majority of the campaign’s spam emails were sent with the subject, “Your RAKBANK Tax
Invoice / Tax Credit Note” or “Conﬁrmation.” This campaign used the abovementioned .html ﬁle, malicious
Excel/Word document VBA macro, the FlawedAmmyy payload, and Amadey. It later delivered an
information stealer named “EmailStealer,” which stolesimple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) credentials and
email addresses in the victim’s machine. We found at least hundreds of SMTP credentials on their C&C
server. It also collected more than a million email addresses, 80% of which were either .com or .ae top-level
domains (TLDs).

On June 24, we found another campaign targeting Lebanon with the ServHelper malware. This one had subcampaigns that targeted India and Italy with different email content.

Targeting banks in India and other countries in Asia
On June 17, we observed the campaign’s spam emails delivering malware-embedded Excel ﬁles directly as
an attachment. The spam emails used subject lines such as “Emirates NBD E-Statement” and “Visa
Canceled” as social engineering lures. This campaign used the ServHelper loader, which was downloaded by
the VBA macro.
A closer inspection of the email showed that its content would have been more applicable to Arabic-speaking
users or countries, particularly the UAE. In the spam emails that used “Visa Canceled” on the subject line, for
example, the email claims to be from the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs – Dubai,
and contained Arabic content. Nonetheless, these spam emails were not delivered to the UAE or Arabicspeaking users, but to banks in Asian countries such as India, Indonesia, and the Philippines.

June 17 (top); the ServHelper-related command-and-control (C&C) trafﬁc (center); and sample spam email
from a similar campaign that used a mix of .html and .xls ﬁles to deliver the ServHelper loader
Targeting Japan, Philippines, South Korea, and Argentina
On June 20, we spotted the campaign’s spam emails delivering .doc and .xls ﬁles. We found the malicious
VBA macro downloading an apparently new and undocumented malware named FlowerPippi, as well as
Gelup (the details of the malware will be discussed below).
On the same day, the campaign targeting South Korea also used .doc and .xls attachments. We did not ﬁnd
any attachments in the few samples we came across, but we found malicious URLs directly in the email
content instead. These URLs lead to the download of malicious .xls ﬁles or .doc ﬁles, with the ﬁnal payload
still being the FlawedAmmyy RAT. This gave us the opportunity to observe TA505’s method of using URLs
to deliver the entry point malware.

Gelup Downloader Malware and FlowerPippi Backdoor
In the campaign that targeted Japan, Philippines, and Argentina on June 20, we found what seems to be a
new, undisclosed malware, which we named Gelup. After our analysis, we found that Proofpoint reported this
malware as AndroMut as well. A custom packer was used to pack some variants of this malware — the same
one that TA505 had been using.
The unpacked payload is written in C++ and basically works as a downloader for another malware. What
makes Gelup different, however, is its obfuscation technique and UAC-bypassing function by mocking
trusted directories (spooﬁng the ﬁle’s execution path in a trusted directory), abusing auto-elevated
executables, and using the dynamic-link library (DLL) side-loading technique. As explained in our technical
brief, Gelup supports techniques that can deter static and dynamic analyses, and has multilayered steps for
installing itself into the system.
Another new malware we found that TA505 is using in their campaigns last June 20 against targets in Japan,
the Philippines, and Argentina is FlowerPippi. This malware acts as a backdoor and downloader, and is a
standalone malware tool and retrieved more straightforwardly than Gelup. Our technical brief provides more
details on FlowerPippi’s capabilities and routines.
Best practices and mitigation
As our research shows, the scale and extent of TA505’s campaigns, which deliver a multitude of threats —
from ransomware to information stealers and backdoors — make them signiﬁcant security issues to
organizations. Their active operations and ever-changing tactics are worth noting. In fact, we’ve already seen
this in a recently disclosed research on their activities on the UAE, South Korea, Singapore, and the U.S.
But more importantly, TA505’s spam campaigns highlight the importance for organizations to secure their
online infrastructures, particularly the email gateways. Adopt best practices on thwarting messaging-related
threats; enforce the principle of least privilege to mitigate further exposure; and regularly update systems (or
use virtual patching for legacy systems) to prevent attackers from taking advantage of security gaps.
Additional security mechanisms like enabling ﬁrewalls and intrusion detection and prevention systems will
help thwart suspicious network activities that may indicate red ﬂags like data exﬁltration or C&C
communication.
