On 12 May, the FBI Cyber Division issued a TLP:WHITE Private Industry Notification. This concerned a spear-phishing campaign distributing
messages that masqueraded as financial institutions to push fake Windows apps containing remote access Trojans (RATs). The most recent
attack impersonated a US-based financial institution to target an American renewable energy company. The spear-phishing email referenced a
fictitious loan and instructed the target organisation’s employees to download a Windows application so as to complete the loan process to
receive $62 million. [1]
The email appeared to have arrived from a UK-based financial institution and confirmed that the US firm’s loan had been accessed and could
be processed using the fake Windows application. The email contained two PDF files, one of which used the names and likeness of the UK’s
National Crime Agency (NCA) and the other appeared to contain SWIFT information. The email had a URL from which to download the
application; it also contained the username and password to access it.
The threat actors had registered a domain (secureportal[.]online) through which they can share the links to the fake Windows applications. At
least four firms were impersonated on this one domain: Cumberland Private UK, Truist, FNB America, and MayBank. [2, 3, 4]
Cyjax analysts investigated the indicators of compromise disclosed by the FBI and uncovered additional files and phishing pages connected to
this ongoing campaign that has been running since at least 2017. The attackers have masqueraded as various financial institutions from
around the world – not just from the US and UK – this includes organisations from Panama, West Africa, Malaysia, and China. They have
posed as investment banks to deliver a similar backdoored Windows application that was described in the FBI PIN.
We analysed the hosting services and name servers used by the initial domain (secureportal[.]online) shared publicly by the FBI for patterns.
This revealed multiple other sites using the same servers, created in the same time frame, masquerading as investment banks:

This investigation uncovered additional fake login pages posing as other investment banks, including Cumberland Private Wealth, Truist, First
National Bank of America, MayBank Private Malaysia, Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), Chase Trust, and the Postal Savings
Bank of China, BNY Mellon, Scotiabank Panama, Multibank Panama, BB&T, and MetroBank.
Pivoting from these additional domains and IP addresses revealed other fake Windows applications that had been used by the attackers to
deliver a backdoor. As summarised in the initial advisory, the attackers send an email to the target containing a URL and login credentials for a
fake website. When these credentials are used to enter the site, the victim downloads an installer which unpacks a ZIP file. This delivers the
backdoored application which, if executed by the user, provides remote access to the device.

Further analysis of the malicious campaign infrastructure exposed several patterns:
All the domains hosted with either Secured Servers (AS20454) or Host Winds (AS54290) and Interserver Name Servers (AS19318)
The attackers either used the “.com” TLD or “.online” gTLD to create lookalike domains to impersonate the investment banks
The Windows applications appear to have been built with an open-source project on GitHub called Squirrel (available here)
The Windows applications are large files, at around 42MB in size, with very low detection ratings on VirusTotal
The Windows applications likely inherited RAT functionality from TeamViewer, a legitimate remote admin tool often used by threat actors

Interestingly, the same servers used by the attackers also hosted several domains impersonating the FBI, Europol, HM Revenue & Customs,
the Bank of England, US Federal Reserve, US Treasury, and the World Bank. It is currently unclear if these domains are connected to the
same campaign: we found no emails, login pages, or samples using them. However, it remains a significant finding because it is of a piece with
these threat actors’ TTPs – the FBI disclosed the threat actors masqueraded as the UK National Crime Agency in one of the PDFs attached to
an email.
This highly targeted campaign has yet to be attributed to a known APT or cybercriminal group. Its success rate is currently unknown, but the
campaign combines multiple techniques corresponding to somewhat sophisticated cybercriminals, making it a serious threat. Using the
information harvested from backdoored systems, the attackers can access their victims’ accounts and various other sensitive data to further
compromise the target networks or steal more funds.
Using fake applications as decoys while performing malicious activity in the background is a common tactic: it has been employed by
cybercriminals and state-backed financially motivated threat actors, such as the Lazarus group. The North Korean APT used its AppleJeus
malware to target hundreds of organisations in over 30 countries during 2020. It used backdoored applications that provided initial access to its
victims’ networks to steal cryptocurrency from their virtual wallets. The earliest versions appeared in 2018. In this campaign, the initial infection
vectors included spear-phishing via emails, malicious links sent via social media, and other social engineering techniques. [5, 6]
