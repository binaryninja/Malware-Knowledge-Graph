Scope Note: Insikt Group conducted interviews with a former Iranian hacker
with first-hand knowledge of the information shared and was living in Iran when
he started one of Iran’s first security forums. This source’s commentary forms
the basis for the background on the genesis of Iran’s offensive cyber efforts.
Additional research was facilitated with Recorded Future and by leveraging thirdparty metadata and open source intelligence (OSINT) techniques using a variety
of tools. While we address historical background and precedent in the piece, the
technical analysis regarding organizations and institutes in Iran’s offensive cyber
program is based on data collected from March 1, 2018 to April 30, 2018.

Executive Summary
Since at least 2009, the Islamic Republic of Iran has regularly responded
to sanctions or perceived provocations by conducting offensive cyber
campaigns. The Islamic Republic has historically preferred to use proxies
or front organizations both in physical conflict — Hezbollah against Israel
and Yemen rebels against Saudi Arabia — and cyberattacks to achieve their
policy goals.
Currently, Iran faces the prospect of negative economic impact via renewed
sanctions. On May 8, 2018 President Trump announced that the United
States would not renew the waivers on sanctions against Iran. The U.S will
instead impose additional economic penalties , the combination of which
amounts to a de facto U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive
Plan of Action (JCPOA) (commonly referred to as the “Iran nuclear deal”.
We assess, based on Iran’s previous reactions to economic pressure, that
with President Trump’s exit from the JCPOA, Iran is likely to respond by
launching cyberattacks on Western businesses within months, if not faster.
Judging from historical patterns, the businesses likely to be at greatest risk
are in many of the same sectors that were victimized by Iranian cyberattacks
between 2012 and 2014 and include banks and financial services,
government departments, critical infrastructure providers, and oil and
energy.

Key Judgments
•

The Islamic Republic has abandoned its typically deliberate and
methodical approach to cyber operations on only two known
occasions, in 2012 and in 2014, when a quick reactionary response
was required. We assess that when Iranian cyber operators
respond to the U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA that the operations
will be staffed and executed by capable, but less trusted
contractors.

•

Further, we assess that staffing these operations with less trusted
contractors could result in a scenario where the Islamic Republic
has difficulty controlling the scope and scale of the destructive
cyberattacks once they have begun.

Recorded Future | www.recordedfuture.com | CTA-2018-0509

•

Iranian cyber operations are administered via a tiered approach,
where an ideologically and politically trusted group of middle
managers translate intelligence priorities into segmented cyber
tasks which are then bid out to multiple contractors. This creates
a quasi-capitalistic system that pits contractors against each other
for influence with the Iranian government.

•

The Islamic Republic operates with embedded paranoia, where
ultimately, no one can be trusted. The situation creates unique
trade-offs in Iran’s government-sanctioned offensive cyber
campaigns; individuals with demonstrated adherence to the
government’s ideology and individuals with the greatest offensive
cyber skills are almost always mutually exclusive.

•

Based on our source’s conversations with other hackers in
Iran, there are over 50 estimated contractors vying for Iranian
government-sponsored offensive cyber projects. Only the best
individuals or teams succeed, are paid, and remain in business.

•

Insikt Group analyzed internet traffic relating to various institutes
affiliated with the Iranian cyber ecosystem from March 1, 2018 to
April 30, 2018. As this is the first profiling of Iranian internet activity
for these institutes, we cannot determine whether the suspicious
activity we analyzed was in preparation of the U.S. announcement.

•

According to Insikt Group’s source, to find and retain the best
offensive cyber talent, Iranian government contractors are forced
to mine closed-trust communities. The links between the forums
and contractors may illustrate that the trust communities begin
with the Iranian security forums.

The History of Iranian Geopolitical Response and the Nuclear
Agreement Decision
Editor’s Note: Where applicable, information in this section was provided by a
former Iranian hacker with direct access to the information provided. Based
on additional corroboration, we assess high confidence in this information. We
refer to this individual as “Insikt Group’s source” in other sections where their
information is cited.
Since 1979, Iran’s reactions to perceived Middle Eastern adversaries’
foreign policy has been a study in the use of proxies. Specifically, Israel,
Saudi Arabia, United States, and Iraq have been frequent targets of Iranianfunded military actions, most recently through Houthi rebels in Yemen, and
Hezbollah everywhere else.
Since 2009, Iran has developed proxies in the cyber domain to partially
obfuscate government fingerprints from foreign attacks. Subsequent to
starting a cyber operations program in 2009, the Iranian government had an
immediate need to use the program in the fall of 2012 after U.S. President
Obama imposed severe financial sanctions on Iran, including removing Iran
from the SWIFT money transfer system.

Recorded Future | www.recordedfuture.com | CTA-2018-0509

According to Insikt Group’s source, the Iranian government authorized
denial-of-service attacks on America’s largest financial services companies
as an immediate response to the sanctions in a campaign dubbed
Operation Ababil. A quick response was top priority, so time and planning
were forgone luxuries for the Iranian government. Instead, the Iranian
government opted for speed and the most capable actors, regardless of
demonstrated ideology.
Similarly, a year later in the fall of 2013, Sheldon Adelson (the CEO of Sands
Corporation) publicly suggested that the United States should attack Iran
with an atomic weapon. In February 2014, Iran launched a destructive
attack on the Sands Las Vegas Corporation that caused significant network
damage. This was the second public Iranian attack campaign on an
American business, where the response called for speed over time and
preparation.
The Iranian attacks in 2012 and 2014 were in contrast to the relatively slow
and methodical work of APT 33, APT 34, and APT 35, developing custom
malware, targeting data exfiltration from strategic intelligence targets such
as U.S. military contractors, Middle East energy companies, and university
research networks.

Comparing Iranian campaigns — methodical versus reactionary.

Building a National Capability — History and Relationships
Between Proxies
The Iranian Revolution replaced the Persian monarchy and transitioned the
Shah’s power to the Islamic Republic, led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
Loyalty to the resulting theocracy was defined by alignment to the Supreme
Leader’s moral precepts.
The new leaders of Iran also established an intelligence and security
organization, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), “charged with
defending the Islamic Republic against internal and external threats.”
Currently, the IRGC is Iran’s premier security organization and possesses an
army, navy, and air force, and manages “Iran’s ballistic missile arsenal and
irregular warfare operations through its elite Quds Force and proxies such
as Hezbollah.”
The IRGC has a vast domestic information security and monitoring mandate,
as well as broad foreign mission, and has been linked to cyberattacks
against Western institutions since at least 2011.
According to Insikt Group’s source, during the 2009 Green Revolution,
Gerdab.ir emerged as the IRGC’s domestic hacking group tasked with
targeting opposition news websites and individuals considered immoral
by the regime. Iranian hackers targeting Iranian government resources
(one example was defacing Khamanei.ir) were identified by Gerdab and
imprisoned. Gerdab continues to act as the Iranian government’s internal
censor.
Following the Green Revolution, the Iranian government considered adding
a formal offensive cyber component to its existing intelligence apparatus,
and was forced to address a personnel problem. Iran needed a talented,
but politically and religiously reliable workforce. Stuxnet and scientist
assassinations reminded Iran of the efficacy of Mossad and CIA programs,
and according to Insikt Group’s source, fervent religious ideology was the
only way to demonstrate loyalty and build trust.
The emergence of the Iranian Cyber Army (ICA) as an extension of the IRGC
was an initial attempt by the Islamic Republic at conducting internationally
focused operations. These operations were a departure from Gerdab’s
focus on maintaining domestic moral values and defending government
rhetoric. In 2011, the IRGC’s ICA formed the foundation of the Khaybar
Center for Information Technology. According to a former IRGC cyber
commander, the Khaybar Center was established in 2011 and has been
linked to a number of attacks against the United States, Saudi Arabia, and
Turkey.
Even today, the balance between ideology and cyber skills remains
problematic. One example of the conflict between ideology and skill was
Mohammad Hussein Tajik, a former cyber commander within the IRGC.
According to Insikt Group’s source, Tajik’s father maintained a strong
religious background and was a veteran of Iran’s ministry of intelligence. Yet
Tajik was arrested and killed because the Iranian government feared that
Tajik was not ideologically aligned and posed a betrayal and flight risk.

Recorded Future | www.recordedfuture.com | CTA-2018-0509

Following the Green Revolution, Iran’s government needed to quickly
improve its cyber capabilities, but according to Insikt Group’s source, the
talent was primarily young and focused on financial benefits. This motivation
bred government mistrust, as the Islamic Republic feared that the financially
motivated could be bought by foreign intelligence services. Additionally,
many of the original Iranian hackers responsible for mass defacements
hated authority and lacked the discipline necessary for government work.
According to Insikt Group’s source, the government answer was a tiered
approach, with a network of people unofficially associated with the
IRGC and Iranian government — a type of ideologically aligned middle
management — that were loyal to the regime and demonstrated sufficient
religious commitment. This middle tier translated intelligence priorities into
segmented cyber tasks which were then bid out to multiple contractors.
Sometimes the contractors would compete with each other, sometimes
they would work together, but payment was only made once the objective
was completed. The result was (and presently remains) a quasi-capitalistic
system that pitted contractors against each other for influence with the
Iranian government.
In the Islamic Republic, influence can lead to security and wealth, but it can
also lead to a false sense of security (no one is above being imprisoned
and questioned at any given time). Thus, contractors must learn to play the
game — enough surface-level adherence to the regime’s ideology — to gain
temporary reprieves from suspicion long enough to be given contracted
work. To the Iranian government, ideology is more important than skills.
Deep belief in the Ayatollah’s precepts and the government’s goals helps to
avoid defections and traitors.

Obfuscating Iranian government involvement in offensive campaigns.

Recorded Future | www.recordedfuture.com | CTA-2018-0509

Today, based on ongoing contact between Insikt Group’s source and
Iranian hackers, it is estimated that there are over 50 organizations vying
for government-sponsored offensive cyber projects. Only the best teams
succeed, are paid, and remain in business. The government does its best to
compartmentalize — one job might be creating a remote code exploit (RCE)
for a popular software application, while another job might be using the RCE
and establishing persistent unauthorized access. Two different contractors
(or more) are typically required to complete the government-defined
objective.
Public knowledge has also established that Iranian academic institutions
play a contractor-like role. Specific examples include Shahid Beheshti
University (SBU) and the Imam Hossein University (IHU), which have
comprehensive science and technology departments attracting some of
the best academic talent in Iran. In fact, the SBU has a specific cyberspace
research institute dedicated to such matters, and the IHU was founded by
the IRGC.
As the Mabna Institute indictments highlight, despite the lifting of sanctions
and an appetite to re-engage with the international community, Iran has
continued a subversive and aggressive global cyber operations campaign.
This ongoing campaign, which targets universities for scientific and
technological intellectual property theft, demonstrates a fundamental lack
of trust in the international agreements, including the Joint Comprehensive
Plan of Action (JCPOA).

Relationship Between the Iranian Government, Contractors,
and Security Forums
Clearsky, FireEye, Symantec, and PhishLabs have all performed significant
research on Iranian nation-state-sponsored campaigns that provide
historical insight into technical capabilities and relationships between the
Iranian government and contractors.
The work of the aforementioned security companies and recent U.S.
Department of Justice indictments provides consistent evidence that Iranian
government-sponsored offensive campaigns are executed by contractors.
FireEye disclosed that the Nasr Institute was an APT 33 contractor in
an operation that used publicly available backdoors and remote access
trojans. The handle “xman_1365_x” (self-identified on security forums as
Mahdi Honarvar) was found by FireEye in malware artifacts, which open
sources linked to the Nasr Institute. Previously, Nasr Institute had been
associated with Operation Ababil’s distributed denial-of-service attacks
against American banks, an organization which a U.S. Department of Justice
indictment confirms had been hired to build attack infrastructure by the
Iranian government.
The actor xman_1365_x was then linked to a security company called
Kavosh Security via OSINT by Iran Cyber News Agency. The actor was linked
to a destructive operation, which used NewsBeef and StoneDrill malware
families. According to Kaspersky, the latter data wiping operation targeted
sectors across Saudi Arabia and Europe.
Recorded Future | www.recordedfuture.com | CTA-2018-0509

Command and control (C2) domains used by StoneDrill and NewsBeef in
Kaspersky’s findings were found to share an SSL certificate, which surfaced
an additional three domains in research by the Iran Cyber News Agency.
WHOIS information was then connected via open sources to Imam Hossein
University (IHU). IHU was named in sanctions by the U.S. Treasury “for
providing, or attempting to provide technological, or other support for and
services in support of the IRGC.”
Additional publicly known Iranian contractors include ITSecTeam (ITSEC) and
Mersad Company, also linked to Operation Ababil.
The links between the Iranian government and contractors are well
documented; however, the identity of specific groups and individuals within
the Iranian government and IRGC responsible for offensive cyber campaigns
is murky, as is the relationship between contractors and security forums.
Yet, our research and analysis suggest that Iranian security forums may
play a role in staffing and knowledge sharing for Iranian contractors. First,
FireEye referenced the publicly available ALFA TEaM Shell in APT33 spear
phishing email campaigns. The ALFA Shell is discussed in multiple web
locations, including Ashiyane and Iranian Dark Coders Team Forum.

Second, xman_1365_x created an Ashiyane profile on August 8, 2010,
allegedly not long after Ashiyane temporarily became the primary security
forum in Iran, following Behrooz Kamalian’s visit to prominent cleric,
Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi.

xman_1365_x created an Ashiyane profile in 2010.

Finally, according to Insikt Group’s source, Iranian contractor ITSEC
specifically employed hackers from the respective online forums Simorgh
and Delta Security. Further, Hossein Asgari, a self-proclaimed Iranian hacker,
managed the Simorgh forum and worked with his father, who was employed
by the IRGC.

According to Insikt Group’s source, to find and retain the best offensive
cyber talent, Iranian government contractors are forced to mine closed-trust
communities. The links between the forums and contractors may illustrate
that the trust communities begin with the Iranian security forums.

Analyzing Iranian Cyber Institute Internet Traffic
Insikt Group analyzed internet traffic relating to various institutes affiliated
with the Iranian cyber ecosystem from March 1, 2018 to April 30, 2018. Our
goal was to determine whether any of these institutes had forecasted Iran’s
intentions in cyberspace leading up to the U.S. decision to withdraw from
the 2015 JCPOA.
This is Insikt Group’s first profiling of internet activity for Iranian cyber
institutes. While we cannot assess whether this level of activity is typical
or not, monitoring it over time to determine changes in response to
international pressure could be revealing.
Cyberspace Research Institute of Iran
Iran’s Cyberspace Research Institute (CSRI) is a research center affiliated
with the prestigious Shahid Beheshti University in Iran. The institute
commands a significant proportion of the university’s allocated IP space,
with no fewer than eight /24 IP ranges registered to the CSRI in Iran,
according to regional RIPE NCC records. The ranges are listed below:

Insikt Group identified several activities of concern emanating from these
ranges.
We discovered over 400 previously unreported SSH sessions between
CSRI ranges and Spanish government and university networks from April
4, 2018 to April 9, 2018. These exchanges involved the transfer of a large
volume of data between the two networks. The Spanish networks resolved
to departments supporting the digital transformation of Spanish public
services and multi-disciplined universities. Direct network connectivity
between the Iranian and Spanish institutions demonstrates that they either
have a deep academic relationship and are sharing data with one another,
or the large transfer of data from the Spanish institutes is unwarranted.
It is unlikely that CSRI would have a valid business interest with Spanish
government departments, so the large volume of data transferred between
the two networks over such a short period of time is a conspicuous
indicator of possibly malicious activity.
Throughout April, Iran’s CSRI simultaneously demonstrated an increased
interest in the Philippine Department of Science & Technology (DOST).
Similar to the Spanish network interactions, very large data volumes were
exchanged between the two networks, denoting strong interest.
This level of engagement and interaction, particularly in light of the
reduction of sanctions, and the thawing of relations between Iran and
the West following the 2015 JCPOA, was expected between academia.
In fact, in 2015 and 2017, Philippine and Spanish universities agreed to
expand scientific cooperation with Iranian institutions. However, given
CSRI’s background, Iran’s demonstrated interest in using cyber operations
to steal academic and intellectual property, and our evidence of ongoing
campaigns targeting universities for theft worldwide, we assess that this
activity between CSRI and these Spanish and Philippine universities may be
malicious.

Recorded Future | www.recordedfuture.com | CTA-2018-0509

CSRI was also observed in a large number of events dispatching the Parsijoo
bot to crawl websites of interest. According to Wikipedia, Parsijoo.ir is the
second most popular search engine in Iran after Google and it uses the
Parsijoobot to crawl websites for indexing purposes. During our research,
we noted repeated crawls of a specialist Canadian-Iranian immigration
website, www.itc-canada[.]com, using Parsijoo bot from CSRI IP ranges.
The crawls were observed throughout our data period from early March
continuing right through to the end of April, suggesting a strong, persistent
interest in this particular site.
Finally, we identified CSRI interacting with IPs registered to Ravand
Cybertech Inc. Ravand Cybertech offers, via its website ravand[.]com,
cloud hosting solutions, among other services. Ravand Cybertech has
strong ties to the Iranian regime. Historically, it hosted the website of the
conservative news agency Fars which is affiliated with the Iranian military.
The company’s registered IP ranges sit under AS12212 with the following
prefixes ranged 198.55.48.0 – 198.55.61.255, 198.55.63.0 – 198.55.63.255
and 207.176.216.0 – 207.176.219.255.
Ravand Cybertech hosted a number of domains used by an Iranian
Ministry of Intelligence Services (MOIS) agent, Massoud Khodabandeh, in
a disinformation campaign conducted in Western media. The campaign
attempted to discredit and demonize the main Iranian opposition party, the
People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran/Mojahedin-e Khalq (PMOI/MEK).
According to an opinion piece written for The Hill, the websites were found
by the Pentagon to be created by order from Tehran. Ravand Cybertech was
identified as being an “Iranian state-run” company, which hosted fake news
sites aimed at disseminating Iranian propaganda to undermine the efforts
of Iranian-American lobbyists.
Based on the volume of activity observed during our research, we assess
the CSRI may be engaged in supporting the malicious disinformation
activities of Ravand Cybertech.
Imam Hossein University (Imam Hussein University)
The Imam Hossein Comprehensive University (IHU) is an Iranian university
based in Tehran that is affiliated with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps
(IRGC), the Iranian Ministry of Science, Research and Technology, and the
Iranian Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics.

During our research, we found that IHU was also very interested in Spanish
higher educational establishments and specific government departments. In
fact, two of the same Spanish establishments exchanged high data volumes
with the IHU source range IPs.
Further web browsing activity from IHU ranges was noted to the website
of a U.S.-based multinational engineering software company, Gamma
Technologies. The browsing activity was centered on its GT-SUITE software.
Gamma Technologies specializes in the development of simulation software
for a wide variety of worldwide industries, including power generation.
Mabna Institute
As previously detailed, the Mabna Institute was publicly identified in an
FBI indictment as a front company engaged in hostile state-sponsored
cyberespionage on behalf of the Iranian state. Our OSINT research
identified a single domain, mabna-ins[.]ir, which could correspond to the
group. The domain was previously hosted on an Iranian IP 5.144.130[.]23
and since April 22, 2017, points at German VPS IP 144.76.87[.]86. This VPS
also hosts over 2,000 other domains, most of which are .ir domains.

Intent, Scenarios for Retaliation, and Recommendations
According to the terms of the JCPOA, Tehran agreed to restrictions on its
nuclear weapons program in exchange for sanctions relief. However, various
provisions of the accord expire at different times over the next 25 years,
with some expiring as soon as 2025.
On May 8, 2018, President Trump decided not to renew the waivers
suspending some U.S. sanctions against Iran and initiated a de facto U.S.
withdrawal from the agreement. As a result of this action, we assess that
Iran will likely respond quickly by launching destructive attacks on American,
European, and rival nation (countries such as Saudi Arabia and Israel)
businesses.
Conversely, Iran may also retaliate (exclusively or in conjunction with
destructive attacks) through cyber proxies in more methodical and
sustained campaigns. Given the impact of re-applied and expanded
economic sanctions, it is likely that American, European, and rival nation
businesses will also be targeted with more sustained destructive attacks.

Recorded Future | www.recordedfuture.com | CTA-2018-0509

As documented above, when pursuing quick-turn cyber operations, the
Iranian regime will weigh religious and political reliability against offensive
skills. The best operators are not always the most devout or loyal to
the regime and we assess that, in this case, the IRGC may forgo careful
contractor selection and planning in an attempt to deliver a destructive
attack within a short period of time.
Further, our research indicates that because of the need for a quick
response, the Islamic Republic may utilize contractors that are less politically
and ideologically reliable (and trusted) and as a result, could be more
difficult to control. It is possible that this dynamic could limit the ability of
the government to control the scope and scale of these destructive attacks
once they are unleashed.
Western businesses should closely monitor geopolitical events initiated
by the United States or Europe that affect Iran. As demonstrated above,
Western businesses are the logical victims of Iranian retaliation for
perceived American policy transgressions; specifically businesses in
financial services, government departments, critical infrastructure providers,
and oil and energy sectors.
In addition to carefully monitoring Iranian geopolitical developments,
tracking emerging tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) on Ashiyane,
specifically, is wise for any Western commercial threat intelligence program
to determine the efficacy of existing security controls.
