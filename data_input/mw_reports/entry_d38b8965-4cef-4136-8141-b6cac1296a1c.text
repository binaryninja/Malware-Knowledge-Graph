Malicious domains vary enormously in quality depending on the use case and the expected
lifespan of the proposed campaign. For example if someone was running a phishing
campaign and wanted to fool a user into clicking a link, the domain used for the link may not
even matter if it is masked in the email and the user is going to believe they are clicking on
something else in the HTML. A low value malicious domain is likely to be used in this
scenario. This could involve something as easy as registering a subdomain similar to the
intended victim as part of a dynamic domain service such as noip.org. An example of these
recently around would be.
hxxps://voicenett.serveftp[.]com/6s17aiqf1hczfv7e
These don’t necessarily need to survive for very long depending on what the next stage of
the planned attack is and can be redirected to any desired payload.
Next in the stack would be similar domains to the victim or the victims supply chain. These
can work very well particularly for email campaigns.
Some recent examples from threat feeds would be
Level 2
loop.microsoftmse[.]com
wellsconfirm-account[.]com
aliorbank[.]io
The use case may this time be to put in the reply-to field of an email as an example.
Business Email Compromise would be a typical example. Its a little more visible to the
victim and therefore needs to be convincing.

On the next tier would be domains that stand out by themselves and look like they would
provide a valid service. These are getting into the high value territory now as there may not
be an obvious reason to block them. They don’t look like another domain to be caught by a
typo squatting rule and may not look anomalous in network traffic, or the service copied is
very generic like Microsoft. However the use case is different to those mentioned before as
it may not be email related.
Level 3
microsoftupdateswin[.]com
serviceupdates[.]net
servicesupdater[.]com
These are very convincing and can be used for long standing campaigns and may survive
for a period of time. This also results in these domains being recycled and reused over the
years, even if they have previously been taken down after being discovered being involved
in malicious activity.
Differentiating after this is broken down into tactics and procedures of the attacker and
things get quite difficult. In order not to give away too much of the defenders toolkit I won’t
go into further detail on this.
Examples From UNC2452 also known as Dark Halo/Sunburst
So now to the indicators from the recent breaches that have been revealed so far.

Nearly all the domains fit into the level 3 category and some would fit into a category higher
due to associated tactics. Firstly they used one main domain which was critical to their
campaign.

Avsvmcloud[.]com
This was further broken down into various subdomains using a Domain Generation
Algorithm. Some good work was done on uncovering the links to victim names here.
This primary domain had its own Nameserver which only had one domain on it.
"domain": "avsvmcloud[.]com",
"to_ns_srv_domain_density": {
"a1-139.avsvmcloud[.]com": 1,

"a6-66.avsvmcloud[.]com": 1
The domain switched to using this name server on 27th February 2020 around the time the
attack began

There are a few notable details here. Switching of name servers just before a campaign
signifies a management process around attacker infrastructure and that is the case for most
of the domains in this campaign. Therefore we give these types of domains a higher
category of “Managed High Value Malicious Domains” In our API for our Threat Intelligence
enrichment we capture this concept with the field of NameServer Entropy.
The rest of the domains have a similar profile except they use a shared NameServer.

To push this idea to the next stage is to see if you can evolve this profile and use it to hunt
for more similar domains and see if this technique is more widespread.
Creating a query to look for similar profiles to the main domain which had to operate from its
own nameserver may lead to other instances of actors using the same technique.
This leads us to a list of very useful domains that have been registered in a similar pattern
as the original avsvmcloud[.]com. This does not mean these are in any way malicious, just
worthy of a further look.
Updates[.]run
fedora-dns-update[.]com was associated with APT22 (Suckfly)back between 2014-2016
but unknown now
virtualserverfaq[.]com
microsoftsonline[.]net -which has already been identified in a different breach claimed to be
APT41
microlynconline[.]com -which has already been identified in a different breach claimed to be
APT27

The list is much longer but very much speculation, so we won’t list any more in a public
forum. Threat Hunters can use this profiling methodology to query datasets such as from
Silent Push to draw a list of candidates worthy of monitoring. Keeping an internal Passive
DNS service going on your own organizational traffic and hunting on all newly encountered
domains within that to correlate with the list of profiled domains would also be worth doing.
Another useful piece of information that surfaces from this is that it is worthwhile searching
within the vast volume of threat indicators you receive for “High Value Domains” and
treating them differently. We have made this available in the advanced filtering part of the
Threat Intelligence Analysts interface.
