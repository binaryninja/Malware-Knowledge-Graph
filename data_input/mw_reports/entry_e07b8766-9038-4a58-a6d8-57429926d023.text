Social Engineering
Remains Key Tradecraft
for Iranian APTs

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS | IRAN

Key Judgments
• The use of social engineering is a central component of
Iranian APT tradecraft when engaging in cyber espionage
and information operations. Iranian APTs will continue
to modify their tradecraft, including phishing, spoofing,
smishing, and other techniques to target their victims.
This report covers Iranian social engineering cases and methodologies. It
serves those looking to better understand, prepare for, and preempt an attack by
Iranian operators against their personnel and organization and benefits Iran-focused
analysts researching topics associated with Iranian social engineering to understand
their typical targets, organizations, and objectives. Sources include the Recorded
Future® Platform and industry reporting from Microsoft, Proofpoint, ClearSky,
FireEye, Mandiant, and CitizenLab, among other open sources.

Executive Summary
Since 2010, pro-Iranian government cyber intrusions have
relied on social engineering as a component of the cyberattack
life cycle, whether executed through spearphishing attacks
or more directly through one-to-one engagements. Iranian
operators have targeted members of foreign governments,
militaries, businesses, and political dissidents. Their operations
appear to use many of the studied “principles of influence” and
overlap with human intelligence (HUMINT) recruitment practices,
both of which influence social engineering methodologies.
Research on the Iranian government’s strategic and tactical
approaches to the offensive and defensive “Soft War” also
suggests that social engineering is an indispensable element of
the government’s cyber capabilities, which it has relied on for
at least a decade. Tehran views the ability for a foreign power
to incite domestic upheaval as being as dangerous as a military
attack on its territory. Equally so, the ability to foment social
unrest internationally is a capability at its disposal to attack
its perceived enemies. Understanding and dissecting foreign
societies, languages, cultures, and political systems has enabled
Tehran to leverage social engineering in ways comparable to
Russian threat activity groups.

• Multiple Iranian threat activity groups use social
engineering. APT35, APT34, and Tortoiseshell remain
among the earliest and most aggressive adopters of
social engineering to aid their intrusion or credential theft
operations. We expect these groups to continue to lead
attacks using social engineering techniques in the future.
• Patterns in Iranian social engineering attacks suggest
they aim to drive targets to multiple platforms; this
increases the attack surface by incorporating email,
social media, and chat messengers as attack vectors.
Malicious documents and applications will continue to be
disseminated via one-to-one sock puppet engagements
with their targets.
• Various reported Iranian social engineering attacks share
approaches, including recruitment offers, offers to solicit
targets for journalistic purposes or political analysis,
romantic engagements, and supposed anti-government
activism.
• The use of foreign languages and knowledge of foreign
societies and cultures will continue to play a central role
in targeted social engineering attacks. Iranian APTs are
improving their command of major languages such as
English and major European, Middle Eastern, and South
Asian languages.

Large-scale social engineering campaigns have predominantly
been executed by APT35, Tortoiseshell, and APT34, and their
associated sub-groups. While their operations do not diminish
those run by other advanced persistent threat groups (APTs),
these 3 Iran-nexus groups have depicted substantial tradecraft
overlaps in how they target their victims. These include the
use of charismatic sock puppets, the lure of prospective job
opportunities, solicitation by journalists, and masquerading as
think tank experts seeking opinions. These are just some of the
personas which these 3 Iranian APTs have continued to use
since the first major disclosure on Iranian social engineering —
Operation Newscaster — was publicly reported in 2014.

In lesser cases, challenging conventional thought or making
provocative and factually inaccurate statements is a reverse
psychology trick to draw in and engage a target. For example,
Iranian APTs may impersonate a news reporter or claim to be an
expert from a reputable think tank. Under this guise, they may
state something a target is likely to hold an opposing analytical
view on in the hope of eliciting a response from the target. As
described by one reputed Iran analyst, this tactic was used in
an attack which eventually aimed to have the target to proceed
to a fake login portal where their credentials would be stolen:

The Approach

The email from a prominent Israeli think tank
offered some provocative suggestions on US
policy towards China. “We must understand
that China is at war with the United States”,
it declared, citing the covid-19 pandemic as
evidence. Its authors recommended that the
Trump administration set up a team of “top
China experts” such as Stephen K. Bannon
and former House speaker Newt Gingrich
to confront “Red China” in the wake of the
coronavirus crisis.

Extensive studies discuss social engineering tradecraft (that
is, persuasion principles) and its effects on human psychology.
The principles considered to be key drivers are “authority”,
“conformity”, “reciprocity”, “commitment”, “scarcity”, and “liking”
(flattery). Applications from such studies are readily visible in
the Iranian social engineering approach. For example, in the
study, commitment is defined as the “likelihood of sticking to
a cause or idea after making a promise or adhesion … which
increases the likelihood of compliance”. The process of liking
“puts that person in a favourable position” where “People tend
to like others who are similar in terms of interests, attitudes, and

before escalating to a commitment phase. Notably, the process of
commitment is observed among all of the threat actor interactions
with victims discussed in this report, with benign documents
being shared to establish trust and initiate the psychological
mechanism of compliance with an attacker’s request. Flattery,
or the prospect of being courted by a charismatic persona or
high-profile recruiter, is another common tactic, technique, and
procedure (TTP) used by various Iranian APTs.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS | IRAN

The authentication-themed domains discovered by Insikt
Group replicate much of the known tradecraft used by Charming
Kitten throughout 2021. Similar to the previous examples, the
operators predominantly register domains using the .site, .online,
.top, .mobi, .network, and .info Top Level Domains (TLDs). The
domains investigated are predominantly registered using the
OnlineNIC or Namecheap service. Furthermore, in continuation
with its known TTPs, Insikt Group research revealed a continued
reliance on OVH and Hetzner GmbH hosting providers.

Strategic Web Compromise
In 2021, at least one Iranian social engineering campaign
was marked by strategic web compromise (SWC) activity to lead
intrusion operations against their victims. The group responsible
(see the TA453 campaign below) compromised a legitimate
website to steal credentials from targets.

Malicious Applications
Malicious applications form a component of the social
engineering threat. Industry research has reported throughout
2021 that a malicious application they dubbed LittleLooter was
used for attack operations. Another sample was detected and
reported by Google’s Threat Analysis Group in October 2021.
The applications are used to target victims from various sectors
inside and outside Iran. These applications are delivered to
victims via social engineering attacks, sometimes involving the
operators directly engaging with victims.

Malicious Documents
Almost every major social engineering campaign in this
report suggests that highly targeted operations revolve around
disseminating malicious documents to enable intrusions. The
threat actors have used both open source and bespoke malware,
such as PupyRAT and LEMPO (LIDERC), respectively, to launch
attacks.

Charismatic Personas
The use of charismatic personas has been a formative
characteristic of Iranian social engineering campaigns. Almost
every case discussed in this report refers to at least one
fabricated profile used to target unsuspecting victims. In some
cases, the profiles were so successful (see Mia Ash) that a
victim, potentially acting under the false illusion of a romantic
engagement, provided their personal details to register domains
used by the threat actor.

Social Engineering Campaigns
Phosphorus
On November 16, 2021, Microsoft’s Threat Intelligence Center
(MSTIC) outlined its observations of Iranian threat actor activity
without giving specific operational examples. Prime among the
groups MSTIC observed were Phosphorus and Curium. MSTIC
reported that Phosphorus was increasingly devoting more
time to engage with its victims by sending benign questions
and engaging in several “back-and-forth conversations” before
sending an “interview request” with links masquerading as Google
Meeting invites. Insikt Group has identified similar examples that
focused on the use of the IMO chat service (Figure 3).
MSTIC analysis revealed that Phosphorus operators have
become more aggressive with their targets, “almost demanding
a response”. On November 20 and 24, 2021, threat actors
impersonated a well-known New York Times Bureau Chief
Thomas Erdbrink, who has covered Iran, in an attempt to target a
dissident activist, Mahsa Alimardani (Figure 3). While the MSTIC
disclosure is not likely related to the Erdbrink impersonation
attempt, it highlights the group’s ongoing attempts to target
its victims notwithstanding public disclosures against it.
Additionally, impersonating journalists is a well-reported tactic
used by the operators associated with the Iran-nexus group
(additional evidence in Appendix).

Fake News Outlets and Journalists
Since the discovery of the Newscaster network, Iranian
social engineering activities have revolved around the use
of journalistic personas, malicious fake news websites (see
APT35 below), or the dissemination of disinformation to trick or
manipulate targets (see Influence Operations below). As noted
in this report, Iranian operators have been identified on various
occasions assuming the personas of journalists or activists when
conducting intrusion or influence operations against targets.
Iranian influence operations have similarly been tracked and
disrupted by industry researchers, social media organizations,
and the US government.

login page for IMO chat video (Source: URLScan)

According to MSTIC, Curium, which highly likely overlaps
with Tortoiseshell, uses more long-term tradecraft. Curium
engages via social media or professional networking accounts,
and will exchange multiple benign files with the victim prior to
sending a malicious document. The act of exchanging files and
visual content is, according to MSTIC, a process of lowering the
victim’s guard. Additional information and a well-known case are
cited in the coverage of TA456 below. Again, throughout many
of the reported social engineering examples, Iranian operators
regularly interact with their victims. For strategic, long-term
targets, groups like Curium and APT34 have proven to attempt
to establish trust and multiple attack vectors to ensure access
to their victim.

TA453

Figure 2: Typical social-engineering example of an email-led interview request (Source: social
media)

A day after the MSTIC disclosure, the advocacy group
United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI) claimed cyber operators
associated with the Iran-nexus group targeted its organization.
It specifically claimed that “its leadership and members of its
Advisory Board’’ were targeted by the group by procuring “data
outside of the public realm, [and] impersonated our leadership
in communications with former senior officials of the US
government, and attempted to harvest Gmail credentials”. The
impersonation of stakeholders is, as noted throughout many of
the cases associated with the APT, a predominant characteristic
of the APT group.

The threat actor tracked by Proofpoint, which it classifies as
TA453, was highly active throughout 2020 and 2021. The group
released 2 reports on their attempts to social engineer research
professionals in the US, UK, and Israel during the reporting time
frame. Between December 2020 and March 2021, the group was
detected launching spearphishing attacks against senior US and
Israeli researchers associated with the medical sciences sector
in a campaign dubbed BadBlood. More specifically, the victims
of the campaign worked in genetic, neurological, and oncological
research. No live engagements with victims were reported;
however, Proofpoint evidence suggests the operators spoofed
the persona of an Israeli physicist and used that as a front to
target at least 25 other senior researchers in the US and Israel.
The lure used — a report on Israel’s nuclear capabilities — was
benign and unrelated to the medical sciences sector. Proofpoint
claimed the operators used known spearphishing techniques,
such as sending emails with the purported assessment on Israel’s
nuclear capabilities attached to them, to steal the victim’s email
credentials. It is unknown what follow-on activity transpired
after successful credential theft or whether the end goal was
to penetrate the medical sector or use their access to victim
accounts to target other members of their networks beyond
medical research.

TA453 was detected again targeting senior researchers
throughout 2021 in an operation dubbed SpoofedScholars.
As part of this campaign, the threat actors masqueraded as
scholars from the University of London’s School of Oriental and
African Studies (SOAS). The fake personas targeted experts in
foreign policy, journalism, and academia that focused on Middle
East politics. The effort was reported as an attempt to garner
strategic insight on the possible effects of future relations vis-avis Tehran. This effort by TA453 operatives revealed that it was
driven to establish extensive relations with targets, communicate
with them, and then drive them to a conference registration link

as a legitimate action.

Flores”. The targets were US defense contractors operating
in the Middle East and subcontractors associated with larger
defense companies. Facebook’s report highlighted the nature of
the likely connected broader campaign, which involved different
accounts posing as “recruiters and employees of defense and
aerospace companies from the countries their targets were
in...Other personas claimed to work in hospitality, medicine,
journalism, NGOs and airlines”.
The persona is categorized as a traditional “honey trap”
operation, where charisma and an attractive image are used to
entice unsuspecting targets. It is reported that honey traps are
a TTP historically used by Iranian threat actor groups to target
enterprises.
Honey traps are a historically common TTP used by Iranian
threat actor groups to target enterprises.
The fake profile identified by Proofpoint is likely to have
been active for at least 2 years, established in late May 2018.
At least 1 victim of the “Marcy” honey trap had been in direct
communication with the fake profile since November 2020;
however, they officially became Facebook “friends” in 2019,
which reveals the methodical and long-term strategic approach
TA456 operators adopted to engage with high-value targets.

Marcy eventually also used a fake Gmail account associated
with the front to deliver malware, known as LEMPO (LIDERC).
According to the research, private and corporate accounts were
affected by TA456’s operation.

In late July 2021, Proofpoint disclosed a campaign on TA456
called “I Knew You Were Trouble”. The campaign reported
by Proofpoint also overlapped with Facebook’s own action,

Throughout 2021, social engineering attacks emanating
from Charming Kitten operations employed much of their known
tradecraft. This included the use of phishing to enable credential
theft operations and invitations to conduct interviews, as noted
earlier (for example, IMO chat). A recurrent aspect of their
credential theft activity was the use of SMS for smishing attacks,
using traditional Google security or Google recovery messages.
This activity likely took place in parallel with the establishment
of attacker-controlled infrastructure.
In 2020, ClearSky Security released its third edition of
“The Kittens Are Back in Town”, a report detailing persistent
attempts by Charming Kitten operators to engage directly with
victims. The objective of the engagement was to drive victims to
encrypted chat platforms, such as WhatsApp, and onward to join
fake video conferences where, presumably, the victims would fall

journalist, human rights activist, and author living in Brooklyn,
New York. The case revealed that MOIS agents, or individuals
associated with the organization, claimed to represent a private
party in Dubai and that the targets of the intelligence operations
had stolen or owed money to the client in the UAE. As part of
the plot, MOIS agents provided contact information, including
a telephone number with a UAE country code, to convince the
private investigator that the request was coming from the UAE.
The following is an excerpt from the indictment, which cites the
statement from the attackers:
I am contacting you on behalf of a client

Hello,
I’m Asal, thank you for your good reporting. Unfortunately, my brother is a computer engineer working with the
sepah [IRGC], and I’m really upset about it because I hate them. I asked him many times to stop working with
them, but he says the pay is good. But in any way possible I would like his cooperation [with the IRGC] to stop.
Last time he was browsing your site he became very upset to see your site content.
I want to do whatever I can, but I care for my brother and I do not want his name ...
But the least I can do for you is to be able to talk about where he is and what he does, who he works with and

If I can help in any way just say it.
