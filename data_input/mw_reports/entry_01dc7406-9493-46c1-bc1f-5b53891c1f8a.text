Japanese game developer Capcom has suffered a ransomware attack where threat actors
claim to have stolen 1TB of sensitive data from their corporate networks in the US, Japan,
and Canada.
Capcom is well-known for its iconic game franchises, including Street Fighter, Resident Evil,
Devil May Cry, Monster Hunter, and Mega Man.
Yesterday, Capcom announced that they had been hit with a cyberattack on November
2nd, 2020, that led to the halting of portions of their corporate network to prevent the
attack's spread.
"Beginning in the early morning hours of November 2, 2020 some of the Capcom Group
networks experienced issues that affected access to certain systems, including email and
file servers. The company has confirmed that this was due to unauthorized access carried

1/7

out by a third party, and that it has halted some operations of its internal networks as of
November 2."
Since the attack, Capcom has been displaying notices on its site warning visitors that
emails and document requests will not be answered due to the attack impacting email
systems.

Notice about email being down
At the time, Capcom did not disclose the details of the cyberattack, but in a ransomware
sample found by security researcher Pancak3 we see that the Ragnar Locker ransomware
gang attacked them.

confidentially contact us on Signal at +16469613731 or on Wire at @lawrenceabrams-bc.

Ransomware gang claims to have stolen 1 TB of files
After running the Ragnar Locker sample, we get access to the ransom note created on
Capcom's computers during the attack. This ransom note provides a huge amount of
visibility into the Ragnar Locker attack.
In the ransom note created during the attack, the Ragnar Locker operators state that they
have stolen 1 TB of unencrypted files from the corporate networks in Japan, the USA, and
Canada.
We have BREACHED your security perimeter and get access to every server of company's
Network in different offices located in Japan, USA, Canada.

Capcom ransom note
Enclosed in the ransom note are seven print.sc URLs that display screenshots of stolen
files, including employee termination agreements, Japanese passports, Steam sales reports
from August, Bank statements, contractor agreements, and a screenshot of Active Directory
Users and Computers MMC for the Capcom Windows domain.

Stolen Capcom August 2020 Steam sales report
Redacted by BleepingComputer
Also enclosed in the ransom note is a link to a private data leak page on Ragnar Locker's
website containing a 24MB archive containing additional stolen documents,
including revenue forecasts, salary spreadsheets, NDAs, immigration forms, corporate
communications, and royalty reports.

4/7

Capcom temporary data leak page
The ransom note contains a link to the Ragnar Locker Tor negotiation site, where
Capcom can discuss the ransom demand with the attackers. At this time, the chat page has
not been used by Capcom, so there is no indication as to the ransom amount Ragnar
Locker is demanding.
Pancak3 told BleepingComputer tonight that Ragnar Locker claims to have encrypted 2,000
devices on Capcom's networks and are demanding $11,000,000 in bitcoins for a decryptor.
This ransom also includes a promise to delete any stolen data and a network penetration
security report.
It should be noted that ransomware negotiation service Coveware has seen ransomware
operations increasingly not keeping their promise to delete stolen data after a ransom is
paid.

5/7

Ragnar Locker has been involved in other massive attacks this year, including ones on
Portuguese multinational energy giant Energias de Portugal (EDP), where a $10.9M
ransom was demanded. In September, they hit French maritime transport and logistics
company CMA CGM, which led to significant downtime for the network and operations.
BleepingComputer has attempted to contact Capcom but has not received a response due
to their email issues.
Update 11/5/20 7:00 PM EST: Added information on ransom amount.
