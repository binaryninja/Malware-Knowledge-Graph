China’s PLA Unit 61419 Purchasing Foreign Antivirus
Products, Likely for Exploitation
recordedfuture.com/china-pla-unit-purchasing-antivirus-exploitation/

Insikt Group
Recorded Future’s Insikt Group has discovered six procurement documents from official
People’s Liberation Army (PLA) military websites and other sources that show the Strategic
Support Force (SSF) branch of the PLA, specifically Unit 61419, has sought to purchase
antivirus software from several major American, European, and Russian security companies.
The PLA’s Unit 61419 sought to purchase English-language versions of the security software
listed below (Table 1). The focus on English versions of these products is notable because
Chinese-language versions would be the more logical choice if the software was intended for
legitimate use or to test the potential exposure of private and commercial end-users in China
to vulnerabilities in foreign antivirus software.
Insikt Group assesses that the purchase of foreign antivirus software by the PLA
poses a high risk to the global antivirus software supply chain. Based on patterns of
past campaigns and tactics, two scenarios are most likely for the PLA’s exploitation of foreign
antivirus software:
Scenario 1: PLA cyber units and affiliated hacking groups will use foreign antivirus programs
as a testing environment for natively developed malware. They will run the malware through
foreign antivirus products to test its ability to evade detection, thereby making it more likely to
successfully infect its targeted victims.
Scenario 2: PLA cyber units and affiliated hacking groups will reverse engineer the foreign
antivirus software code to find previously undisclosed vulnerabilities. They will then use the
newly discovered vulnerabilities in a zero-day attack for initial intrusion.

Insikt Group
Insikt Group also found a contract award announcement published by the SSF related to the
acquisition of Cisco routers, among other pieces of communications technology. This
document uses the same contact address associated with Unit 61419 as many of the
antivirus procurement documents.

Patterns of Past Campaigns
Several factors inform our assessment that the purchase of English-language foreign
antivirus software is motivated by SSF’s role in computer network exploitation by the Chinese
military:
China has demonstrated a pattern of software supply chain exploitation in multiple
cyber intrusion campaigns, including against some of the foreign antivirus software
purchased in 2019.
1. In 2017, over 2.27 million users of Avast CCleaner were compromised by a malicious
update planted by a Chinese state-sponsored threat actor, resulting in over 1.6 million
computers being infected with the first-stage Floxif trojan. A small subset of those
victims was infected with a second-stage trojan, likely for espionage.
2. In the summer of 2019, a Chinese state-sponsored APT called Tick Group exploited
two zero-days impacting Trend Micro’s Apex One and OfficeScan XG enterprise
security products.
3. In 2019 and 2020, the US Justice Department indicted five members of the Chinese
APT known as APT41 with an intrusion campaign affecting more than 100 companies
globally. APT41 compromised software providers and then modified the providers’
code to facilitate further intrusions against the software providers’ customers. The
objectives of the campaign were espionage and cryptocurrency mining.
4. In October 2019, Avast announced a second breach of the CCleaner software. This
time, the hackers successfully breached the infrastructure to which CCleaner hosting
had been moved following the 2017 compromise. The Czech Security Information
Service (BIS) attributed this attack to Chinese threat actors.
5. In October 2020, Google’s Threat Analysis Group reported that Chinese statesponsored hacking group APT31 impersonated the antivirus company McAfee to
conduct targeted attacks on the Biden campaign’s email system. Targets were
prompted to install a legitimate version of McAfee Total Protection antivirus software
from GitHub, while the malware was simultaneously installed to the system. McAfee
Total Protection is one of the antivirus packages purchased by Unit 61419 a year
prior.
6. In 2021, Microsoft announced that a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group,
HAFNIUM, used four zero-day exploits to gain access to and install web shells on
Microsoft Exchange servers, compromising Outlook Web Access (OWA) in as many
as 60,000 organizations worldwide.
Additionally, the Chinese government has not used foreign antivirus software for
legitimate purposes since 2014, when it was banned. In August 2014, the state-owned
3/6

news agency People's Daily reported that the Central Government Procurement Department
(中央政府采购部门) excluded Kaspersky and Symantec from a list of approved information
security software providers. Chinese officials approved the use of five China-based firms:
Qihoo 360 Technology, Venustech, CAJinchen, Beijing Jiangmin, and Rising. China’s
Ministry of Public Security issued a notice in June 2014 stating that Symantec software had
security vulnerabilities including backdoors that could allow outside access.

Who Is PLA Unit 61419?
Unit 61419 is the Military Unit Cover Designator (MUCD) for a bureau within the People’s
Liberation Army (PLA) Strategic Support Force (SSF). Although publicly available
documentation is scarce, the unit’s area of responsibilities included interpretation of foreign
signals intelligence (SIGINT) and other cyber operations, with a focus on Japan and Korea,
when it was first identified in 2011. Researchers at the Project 2049 Institute assessed Unit
61419 to be the 4th Operational Bureau of the PLA General Staff Department’s (GSD) Third
Department (3PLA). 3PLA was broadly responsible for defensive SIGINT, including
monitoring Chinese communication networks, protecting the security of Chinese domestic
computer networks, and conducting cyber espionage-oriented computer network exploitation
(CNE). Beginning in 2015, the GSD and 3PLA were disbanded, with their capabilities and
focus reorganized, at least in part, into the SSF’s Network Systems Department (NSD).
The unit is headquartered in Qingdao (location described in detail below) and comprises
multiple subordinate offices, each with its own MUCD. These offices are located in Qingdao
and surrounding areas, Hangzhou, Beijing, and Shanghai. Each of these offices likely has its
own MUCD.1 One of these, Unit 61680, is located in the Wenquan township (温泉镇) under
Jimo city (即墨市) and has a training center there. Unit 61650 uses the same address as Unit
61419 for its equipment procurement, suggesting it is a subordinate office as well. Unit
61789 is subordinate as well and is probably located in Shanghai. Research conducted by
Unit 61419 members includes a 2008 paper on the extension of the US’s “nuclear umbrella”
to Korea as well as medical topics, the latter focus suggesting the unit has a medical
department. A logistics department manages Unit 61419’s properties and a political
department handles discipline and political education, as in most other PLA units. Unit 61419
may have a training base in Xinzhou, Shanxi province.2

Recent reporting from Japan implicates Unit 61419 in a series of cyberattacks on companies
like Mitsubishi Electric, Hitachi, Keio University, Hitotsubashi University, and the Japan
Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) in 2016 and 2017. The wife of a member of Unit
61619 reportedly instructed a Chinese student living in Japan to rent servers using an alias.
Those servers were then used in some of the cyberattacks referenced above. Japanese
media further cited Japan’s Tokyo Metro Police Department’s Public Safety Bureau in
asserting that Unit 61419 is linked to the Tick Group APT, which was also identified as being
behind the 2016 and 2017 cyberattacks. Although definitive attribution of Tick Group to Unit

4/6

61419 remains difficult to confirm at this time, the APT has historically focused on Japanese
targets. This aligns with Unit 61419’s focus on Japan. Moreover, Tick Group’s exploitation of
zero-days impacting Trend Micro’s Apex One and OfficeScan XG enterprise security
products occurred months before a November 2019 procurement announcement for Trend
Micro’s Worry-Free Services Advanced was issued by an SSF unit using Unit 61419’s
headquarters as the application delivery address.
Given the tentative links to cyberattacks in Japan and Tick Group, as well as the
procurement activities identified in this report, Unit 61419 most likely continues to operate as
an SSF NSD bureau focused at least in part on CNE operations.

Locating Unit 61419
Insikt Group identified several important patterns from the six procurement
documents. All six documents list a consistent point of contact — a “Mr. Yu” (于先生) —
along with a phone number.
Six of the documents also list the same contact address in Qingdao City, Shandong
province: No. 5 Fushun Road, Shibei District, Qingdao City, Shandong Province, postal code
266034 (山东省青岛市市北区抚顺路5号, 邮编266034), as seen in Figure 5, below. All of the
procurement documents for Unit 61419 use this address. This address is also used for other
units, such as 61650, that are likely subordinate to Unit 61419.
Figure 3: Screenshot of address from procurement document application instructions
In addition to the procurement documents, Insikt Group found a 2018 electricity outage
notice listing Unit 61419’s logistics department as an affected party on Fushun Road. The
notice, in Figure 4 reads, “35kV Fushun Road Substation｜Planned blackout … 61419
logistics department of the Army affects 2 stations and 231 district customers.” Figure 4:
2018 electric outage notice identifies the Fushun Road substation as the power source for a
facility managed by PLA’s Unit 61419 Logistics Department
Baidu Maps shows that No. 5 Fushun Road is the location of a hotel in Qingdao called the
Bihaiyuan Hotel (碧海园宾馆). Some of the procurement documents No. 5 Fushun Road
refer directly to this hotel or its front desk (Figure 7).
Figure 5: Street view of Bihaiyuan Hotel (碧海园宾馆) Figure 6: Street view of Bihaiyuan
Hotel (碧海园宾馆) and adjacent security checkpoint and gate Figure 7: Procurement
footnotes direct the delivery of application materials to an address of the Bihaiyuan Hotel (碧
海园宾馆)
Recorded Future assesses that the No. 5 Fushun Road address is the headquarters of Unit
61419 and that the Bihaiyuan Hotel is its public face. Behind the hotel is a walled compound
similar to the headquarters of other PLA units (Figure 8). Our assessment corroborates
Project 2049 Institute’s finding in 2011 that this address was the likely headquarters.
Figure 8: Map of Bureau 61419’s compound based on Insikt Group’s analysis. The primary
compound (shown in red) is adjacent to or shares space with two other gated facilities
5/6

(shown in dark red). The degree to which the Unit 61419 compound is separated, as well as
the level of security at internal gates, is unclear based on available satellite imagery.
For example, in a January 2016 report compiled by the US Army's Asian Studies
Detachment, the Jingtang Hotel and Seasons Hotel were linked to the 4th Department of the
General Staff Headquarters of the PLA (4PLA), which was responsible for electronic and
information warfare, including offensive cyber operations, prior to its dissolution and
reorganization into the SSF.
Limited evidence suggests the use of hotels is a model used by PLA units in a possible
attempt to obfuscate their locations. Past reports have alleged that PLAY cyber and
electronics units have leased floors of hotel rooms for their operations or as possible
headquarters.
The Bihaiyuan Hotel is also not the only hotel associated with Unit 61419. A 2018 lawsuit
filed by PLA Unit 61789 against Shanghai Golden Hope Hotel Management Co. Ltd. (上海金
色希望酒店管理有限公司) over a breach of its "Military Real Estate Lease Contract",
indicates that in 2014 Unit 61419 leased a building on Yan'an Middle Road in Shanghai to
the hotel management company. The lawsuit indicates that Unit 61789 was subordinate to
Unit 61419 in 2017. Unit 61850, former 3PLA’s 7th Operational Bureau, is also identified as a
party in the dispute. The location of the leased building may have been No. 802 Yan’an
Middle Road, Jing’an District, Shanghai City, where Shanghai Golden Hope Hotel previously
operated a hotel.

Recommendations
Given the pattern of Chinese state-sponsored exploitation of the global software supply chain
described above, as well as China’s exclusion of foreign antivirus software as an option for
government organizations, the brands and products indicated in Table 1 should be monitored
for future exploitation. Focus should be placed on adversarial simulations, penetration
testing, patching known vulnerabilities, and monitoring for anomalous traffic related to these
antivirus products.
While Recorded Future is not in a position to evaluate the precise legality of any transactions
that may have resulted from the procurement documents we reviewed, we further
recommend any impacted organization seek legal counsel about the sales of security
software to China given the US Department of Commerce’s Export Administration
Regulations (EAR) regulations that cover information security software.
