IBM X-Force research follows developments in the financial cybercrime arena to map the
events and trends that shape the threat landscape for organizations and consumers alike.
After a year that has been very active in terms of banking malware, point-of-sale (POS)
malware and rampant ransomware attacks, the X-Force team identified a new banking
Trojan active in the wild dubbed IcedID.

IcedID Emerges
According to X-Force research, the new banking Trojan emerged in the wild in September
2017, when its first test campaigns were launched. Our researchers noted that IcedID has a
modular malicious code with modern banking Trojan capabilities comparable to malware
such as the Zeus Trojan.
At this time, the malware targets banks, payment card providers, mobile services providers,
payroll, webmail and e-commerce sites in the U.S. Two major banks in the U.K. are also on
the target list the malware fetches.
IcedID does not seem to have borrowed code from other Trojans, but it implements
comparable features that allow it to perform advanced browser manipulation tactics.
Although IcedID’s capabilities are already up to par with those of other banking Trojans such
as Zeus, Gozi and Dridex, our researchers believe it will see further updates in the coming
weeks.

Served by Emotet

X-Force’s analysis of IcedID’s delivery method suggests that its operators are not new to the
cybercrime arena, opting to infect users via the Emotet Trojan. X-Force research believes
that a threat actor or a small cybergang has been operating Emotet as a distribution
operation for banking Trojans and other malware codes this year. Emotet’s most prominent
attack zone is the U.S. To a lesser extent, it also targets users in the U.K. and other parts of
the world.
Emotet has been one of the notable malware distribution methods in 2017, serving elite
cybercrime groups from Eastern Europe, such as those operating QakBot and Dridex. It has
now added IcedID as a new payload drop.
Emotet emerged in 2014 after a leak of the original source code of the Bugat Trojan. It was
originally a banking Trojan that preceded Dridex. As such, it is designed to amass and
maintain botnets. Emotet persists on the machine and then fetches additional components
such as a spamming module, a network worm module, and password and data stealers for
Microsoft Outlook email and browser activity.
Emotet itself comes via malspam, usually inside rigged productivity files that contain
malicious macros. Once Emotet infects the endpoint, it becomes a silent resident and is
operated to serve malware from other cybercriminal groups.

IcedID’s TTPs
When it comes to tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), IcedID has a few tricks up its
sleeve.
Aside from the more common Trojan features, IcedID can propagate over a network. It
monitors the victim’s online activity by setting up a local proxy for traffic tunneling, which is a
concept reminiscent of the GootKit Trojan. Its attack tactics include both webinjection attacks
and sophisticated redirection attacks similar to the scheme used by Dridex and TrickBot.

Network Propagation
IcedID’s operators probably plan on targeting businesses because they added a network
propagation module to the malware from the get-go. IcedID possesses the ability to move to
other endpoints, and X-Force researchers also observed it infecting terminal servers.
Terminal servers typically provide terminals, such as endpoints, printers and shared network
devices, with a common connection point to a local area network (LAN) or a wide area
network (WAN), which suggests that IcedID has already been targeting employee email to
land on organizational endpoints.

To find other users to infect, IcedID queries the lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP).

IcedID’s financial fraud TTPs include two attack modes: webinjection attacks and redirection
attacks.
To begin, the malware downloads a configuration file from the Trojan’s command-and-control
(C&C) server when the user opens the internet browser. The configuration includes targets
for which a webinjection attack will be activated — mostly banks and other targets that were
fitted with redirection attacks, such as payment cards and webmail sites.

Technical Details
X-Force researchers ran a dynamic analysis on IcedID samples. At this time, the malware
deploys on endpoints running various versions of the Windows operating system. It does not
appear to possess any advanced anti-virtual machine (VM) or anti-research techniques,
aside from the following:
It requires a reboot to complete full deployment, possibly to evade sandboxes that do
not emulate rebooting.
It communicates via secure sockets layer (SSL) to add a layer of security to the
communications and to bypass automated scans by intrusion detection systems.
That being said, X-Force researchers assert that anti-forensic features could be added to this
Trojan over time.

Payload Deployment
IcedID is deployed to target endpoints using the Emotet Trojan as a dropper. After a reboot,
the payload is written to the Windows %LocalAppData% folder with a value generated per
some parameters from the operating system. That value is used both in the deployment path
and the RunKey value for the file.
The full convention for the value is: %LOCALAPPDATA%\[a-z]{9}\[a-z]{9}.exe.
C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\ewonliarl\ewonliarl.exe
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\ewonliarl

The malware sets its persistence mechanism by creating a RunKey in the registry to ensure
its survival after system reboot events.

Next, IcedID writes an RSA crypto key to the system into the AppData folder. The malware
may write to this RSA key during the deployment routine, which could be linked to the fact
that web traffic is tunneled through IcedID’s process even as it channels SSL traffic. X-Force
is still investigating the exact use of the RSA key.
The temp file is written according to the following convention: %TEMP%\[A-F0-9]{8}.tmp.
C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\S-1-5-21-21371457312486784493-1554833299-1000\fdbe618fb7eb861d65554863fc5da9a0_883f9a43-a12c410f-b47d-bb7275830b53
C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\CACCEF19.tmp

IcedID’s process continues to run, which is rather uncommon for malware. This could mean
that some parts of the code are still being fixed and that this issue will change in the next
update.
The deployment process ends here and the dropper continues to run under the Explorer
process until the next reboot of that endpoint. Upon the reboot event, the payload is
executed and the IcedID Trojan becomes resident on the endpoint. At this point, the
malware’s components are in place to begin redirecting the victim’s internet traffic through a
local proxy that it controls.

Tunneling the Victim’s Web Traffic
IcedID sets up a local proxy to listen and intercept communications from the victim’s endpoint
and redirects all internet traffic through it in two hops. First, the traffic is transferred to the
localhost (127.0.0.1) via port 49157, which is part of the dynamic/private TCP/IP ports.
Second, the malware’s malicious process listens on that port and exfiltrates relevant
communications to its C&C server.

Triggering the Redirection to a Bank Site Replica
Although it has only recently been launched, IcedID already uses redirection attacks. The
redirection scheme IcedID uses is not a simple handover to another website with a different
URL. Rather, it is designed to appear as seamless as possible to the victim. These tactics
include displaying the legitimate bank’s URL in the address bar and the bank’s correct SSL
certificate, which is made possible by keeping a live connection with the actual bank’s site.
IcedID’s redirection scheme is implemented through its configuration file. The malware
listens for the target URL from the list and, once it encounters a trigger, executes a
designated webinjection. The webinjection sends the victim to a fake bank site set up in
advance to match the one originally requested.

5/9

The victim is fooled into submitting his or her credentials on the fake page replica, which
unknowingly sends him or her to the attacker’s server. From that point on, the attacker
controls the session the victim goes through, which typically includes social engineering to
trick the victim into divulging transaction authorization elements.

Malware Communications
IcedID’s communications take place over encrypted SSL. During a campaign analyzed in
late October, the malware communicated with four different C&C servers.
A schematic view of IcedID’s infection and communication infrastructure is shown below.

Figure 3: IcedID’s infection and communication infrastructure
To report new infections to the botnet, IcedID sends an encoded message with the bot ID
and basic system information:
Figure 4: IcedID’s C&C communication
Parts of the decoded message shows the following details being sent to the C&C:
B = Bot ID
K = Computer Name
L = Workgroup
M = OS version

Remote Inject Panel
To orchestrate webinjection attacks for each targeted bank site, IcedID’s operators have a
dedicated, web-based remote panel accessible with a username and password combination.
Webinjection panels are typically commercial offerings criminals buy in underground
markets. It is possible that IcedID’s uses a commercial panel or that IcedID itself is
commercial malware. However, at this time there is no indication that IcedID is being sold in
the underground or Dark Web marketplaces.

The panel communicates back to a server based on the OpenResty web platform. According
to its official website, OpenResty is designed to help developers easily build scalable web
applications, web services and dynamic web gateways.

A New Player in the Cybercrime Arena?
6/9

IcedID is a newly identified threat in the financial cybercrime arena. While it is still early to tell
how it will fare, its current capabilities, distribution choices and targets point to a group that is
no stranger to this domain.
