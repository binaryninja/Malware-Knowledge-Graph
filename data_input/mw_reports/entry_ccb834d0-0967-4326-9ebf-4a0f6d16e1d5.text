Harvester: Nation-State-Backed Group Uses New Toolset to Target
Victims in South Asia

A previously unseen actor, likely nation-state-backed, is targeting organizations in South Asia, with a focus on
Afghanistan, in what appears to be an information-stealing campaign using a new toolset.
The Harvester group uses both custom malware and publicly available tools in its attacks, which began in
June 2021, with the most recent activity seen in October 2021. Sectors targeted include telecommunications,
government, and information technology (IT). The capabilities of the tools, their custom development, and the
victims targeted, all suggest that Harvester is a nation-state-backed actor.

New toolset deployed
The most notable thing about this campaign is the previously unseen toolset deployed by the attackers.
The attackers deployed a custom backdoor called Backdoor.Graphon on victim machines alongside other
downloaders and screenshot tools that provided the attackers with remote access and allowed them to spy
on user activities and exfiltrate information.

1/4

We do not know the initial infection vector that Harvester used to compromise victim networks, but the first
evidence we found of Harvester activity on victim machines was a malicious URL. The group then started to
deploy various tools, including its custom Graphon backdoor, to gain remote access to the network. The
group also tried to blend its activity in with legitimate network traffic by leveraging legitimate CloudFront and
Microsoft infrastructure for its command and control (C&C) activity.
Tools used:
Backdoor.Graphon - custom backdoor that uses Microsoft infrastructure for its C&C activity
Custom Downloader - uses Microsoft infrastructure for its C&C activity
Custom Screenshotter - periodically logs screenshots to a file
Cobalt Strike Beacon - uses CloudFront infrastructure for its C&C activity (Cobalt Strike is an off-theshelf tool that can be used to execute commands, inject other processes, elevate current processes, or
impersonate other processes, and upload and download files)
Metasploit - an off-the-shelf modular framework that can be used for a variety of malicious purposes on
victim machines, including privilege escalation, screen capture, to set up a persistent backdoor, and
more.
The custom downloader used by the attackers leverages the Costura Assembly Loader. Once on a victim
machine, it checks if the following file exists:
[ARTEFACTS_FOLDER]\winser.dll
If the file does not exist it downloads a copy from the following URL:
hxxps://outportal[.]azurewebsites.net/api/Values_V2/Getting3210
Next, the sample creates the following file if it does not exist:
"[ARTEFACTS_FOLDER]\Microsoft Services[.]vbs"
Then it sets the following registry value to create a loadpoint:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\"MicrosoftSystemServices"
= "[ARTEFACTS_FOLDER]\Microsoft Services[.]vbs"
Finally it opens an embedded web browser within its own UI using the following URL:
hxxps://usedust[.]com
While it initially appeared that this URL may have been a loadpoint for Backdoor.Graphon, upon further
investigation it appears to be a decoy to confuse any affected users.
Backdoor.Graphon is compiled as a .NET PE DLL with export “Main” and the following PDB file name:
D:\OfficeProjects\Updated Working Due to Submission\4.5\Outlook_4.5\Outlook 4.5.2 32 bit New
without presistancy\NPServices\bin\x86\Debug\NPServices[.]pdb
When this is executed, it attempts to communicate with the attackers’ C&C servers, which are hosted on
Microsoft infrastructure.

[INFECTION_ID]
The attackers then run commands to control their input stream and capture the output and error streams.
They also periodically send GET requests to the C&C server, with the content of any returned messages
extracted and then deleted.
Data that cmd.exe pulled from the output and error streams is encrypted and sent back to the attackers’
servers.
The custom screenshot tool was also packed with the Costura Assembly Loader. The screenshot tool takes
photos that it saves to a password-protected ZIP archive for exfiltration, with all archives older than a week
deleted.

Ongoing activity
While we do not have enough evidence yet to attribute Harvester’s activity to a specific nation state, the
group’s use of custom backdoors, the extensive steps taken to hide its malicious activity, and its targeting all
point to it being a state-sponsored actor. Harvester’s use of legitimate infrastructure to host its C&C servers in
order to blend in with normal network traffic is one example of the stealthy steps taken by this actor.
The targeting of organizations in Afghanistan in this campaign is also interesting given the huge upheaval
seen in that country recently. The activity carried out by Harvester makes it clear the purpose of this
campaign is espionage, which is the typical motivation behind nation-state-backed activity.
That Harvester’s most recent activity was seen earlier this month means that organizations in the sectors and
geographies mentioned should be alert to the malicious activity outlined in this blog.
