In the interest of helping customers concerned about the Solorigate attacks we are
publishing a new workbook in the Azure AD admin portal to assist investigations into the
Identity Indicators of Compromise related to the attacks. The information in this workbook is
available in Azure AD audit and sign in logs, but the workbook helps you collect and visualize
the information in one view.
The workbook is split into 4 sections, each aimed at providing information associated with
the attack patterns we have identified:
1. Modified application and service principal credentials/authentication methods
1/6

2. Modified federation settings
3. New permissions granted to service principals
4. Directory role and group membership updates for service principals
First, we’ll detail how to access the workbook and then walk through each of these in turn.
Check out this cool video to see it in action!

Accessing the workbook
If you organization is new to Azure Monitor workbooks, you’ll need to integrate your Azure
AD sign-in and audit logs with Azure Monitor before accessing the workbook. This allows you
to store, and query, and visualize your logs using workbooks for up to 2 years. Only sign-in
and audit events created after Azure Monitor integration will be stored, so the workbook will
not contain insights prior to that date. Learn more about the prerequisites to Azure Monitor
workbooks for Azure Active Directory. If you have previously integrated your Azure AD signin and audit logs with Azure Monitor, you can use the workbook to assess past information.
To access the workbook:
1. Sign into the Azure portal
2. Navigate to Azure Active Directory > Monitoring > Workbooks
In the Troubleshoot section, open the Sensitive Operations Report

Modified application and service principal credentials/authentication
methods
One of the most common ways for attackers to gain persistence in the environment is by
adding new credentials to existing applications and service principals. This allows the
attacker to authenticate as the target application or service principal, granting them access to
all resources to which it has permissions.
This section includes the following data to help you detect such actions:
All new credentials added to apps and service principals, including the credential type
Top actors and the amount of credentials modifications they performed
A timeline for all credential changes
You can use the filters present in this section to further investigate any of the suspicious
actors or service principals that were modified.

Modified federation settings
Another common approach to gaining a long-term foothold in the environment is modifying
the tenant’s federated domain trusts and effectively adding an additional, attacker controlled,
SAML IDP as a trusted authentication source.
This section includes the following data:
Changes performed to existing domain federation trusts
Addition of new domains and trusts
Any actions which modify or add domain federation trusts are rare and should be treated as
high fidelity to be investigated as soon as possible.

New permissions granted to service principals
In cases where the attacker cannot find a service principal or an application with a high
privilege set of permissions through which to gain access, they will often attempt to add the
permissions to another service principal or app.
This section includes a breakdown of the AppOnly permissions grants to existing service
principals. Admins should investigate any instances of excessive high permissions being
granted, including, but not limited to, Exchange Online, Microsoft Graph and Azure AD
Graph.

Directory role and group membership updates for service principals
Following the logic of the attacker adding new permissions to existing service principals and
applications, another approach is adding them to existing directory roles or groups.
This section includes an overview of all changes made to service principal memberships and
should be reviewed for any additions to high privilege roles and groups.

Conclusion
This workbook includes an overview of some of the common attack patterns in AAD, not only
in Solorigate, and should be used as an investigation aid in conjunction with the steps
described in the articles linked at the beginning to ensure your environment is safe and
protect is from malicious actors.

The Solarwinds attack is an ongoing investigation, and our teams continue to act as first
responders to these attacks. As new information becomes available, we will make updates
through our Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) blog at https://aka.ms/solorigate.
