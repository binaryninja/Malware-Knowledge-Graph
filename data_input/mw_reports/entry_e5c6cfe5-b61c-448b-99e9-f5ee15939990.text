Advanced Persistent Threats:
A Decade in Review
Command Five Pty Ltd
June 2011

ABSTRACT
This document defines the term Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) in
the context of cyber threats and cyber attack. It presents a timeline and
summary of prominent cyber attacks likely attributable to APTs over
the past decade. Commonalities are identified and assessed in the
context of the current cyber threat environment. Trends are used to
predict future APT targeting. APT attack methodology is discussed, and,
in conclusion, a set of security practices and policies are provided that
could help many organisations increase their resilience to APT attack.

DEFINITION

ADVANCED PERSISTENT THREATS

When the term Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is
used in the context of cyber threats (or cyber attack)
each component of the term is relevant.

Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are a well­
resourced, highly capable and relentless class of
hacker increasingly referred to in the media, by IT
security companies, victims, and law enforcement.
Most hackers target indiscriminately and instead of
persisting with a particular target draw their focus
to more vulnerable targets. APTs on the other hand
are not only well resourced and capable but
persistent in their covert attempts to access
sensitive information, such as intellectual property,
negotiation strategies or political dynamite, from
their chosen targets.

Advanced
The hacker has the ability to evade detection and the
capability to gain and maintain access to well
protected networks and sensitive information
contained within them. The hacker is generally
adaptive and well resourced.
Persistent
The persistent nature of the threat makes it difficult
to prevent access to your computer network and,
once the threat actor has successfully gained access
to your network, very difficult to remove.
Threat
The hacker has not only the intent but also the
capability to gain access to sensitive information
stored electronically.

The sophistication of APT intrusion attempts
varies and likely depends on the attacker’s
objectives, the tools and techniques available to
them, and the anticipated ability of their target both
to detect and defend against an attack. The activity
conducted by APTs is not necessarily sophisticated
but the attacker has the ability to upgrade their
sophistication in order to gain or maintain access to
computer systems of interest. The level of
covertness employed may depend on factors such as
the anticipated ability of the target to detect the

activity, the anticipated response of the target
should the targeting be detected, the level of risk the
hacker is willing to accept, their timeframe to obtain
the desired information and the effects on their
longer term goals.
The term APT is commonly used in reference to
the cyber threat posed by foreign intelligence
services, or hackers working on behalf of such
entities, but is not limited just to this and can equally
be applied to other threat actors such as organised
crime syndicates and those involved in traditional
espionage. Even though some organised crime
syndicates are very well resourced and capable, they
are not usually classed as an APT since they are less
likely to persist with attempted access to a
particular target. The term is not usually used to
refer to the threat posed by an individual hacker as
they rarely have a sufficient level of resourcing.
APTs often target unpublicised vulnerabilities in
computer programs or operating systems using
‘zero day’ exploits 1. Typically only well­resourced
hackers develop such exploits as they are
expensive2, time­consuming3, and the vulnerabilities
they target may be patched prior to deployment
affecting the value of the investment. In addition,
zero day exploits are exposed the first time they are
used and, if detected, may be less effective in future
attacks. As such, zero day exploits are usually only
deployed when the hacker has determined that
other exploits (that take advantage of publicly
known vulnerabilities) will not work on the target,
or are not expected to work within an acceptable
timeframe. Increased use of a zero day exploit may
also be observed if the hacker believes their exploit
has been detected or the vulnerability it exposes has
become known. This behaviour reflects a desire to
maximise the return on their investment before the
relevant vulnerability is patched. Zero day exploits
are commonly used in combination with social
engineering techniques, to exploit vulnerabilities in
human nature and make the targeting more
effective. Social engineering techniques are also

often used to increase the effectiveness of exploits
that target known, but unpatched, vulnerabilities.
VICTIM REPORTING
Many of the organisations targeted by APTs are
likely unaware they are among the victims. Those
that are aware of attacks against them may not
publicly disclose the fact due to concerns about their
reputation or share price. Public reports of APT
attacks date back to at least 1998, when the
Pentagon, National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA), the United States (US)
Energy Department, research laboratories and
private universities were targeted. The past year
(2010/2011) has seen an increase in the number of
organisations coming forward, admitting they have
been targeted. It has also seen an increase in US
Securities and Exchange Commission filings warning
shareholders about the risks of cyber attack.
The majority of companies that have come
forward and admitted they are among the victims
have not been forthcoming with the details. This is
presumably because they do not want to provide the
hackers with feedback, or cause further
embarrassment to their organisation. It is
unfortunate
that
such
potential
negative
ramifications of detailed reporting are often seen to
outweigh the community benefit of sharing lessons
learned.

1 A ‘zero day’ exploit is a computer attack capability that takes

advantage of a software flaw before it is known to the public or
patched by the vendor, that is, before the first day of public
awareness of the flaw; on the zeroth day.
2 On the black market zero day exploits can be worth hundreds of
thousands or possibly even millions of dollars. (Moyanhan, 2011)
3 Developing a zero day exploit can take up to several months
even from the most expert hackers. (Borders, 2007)

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ATTACKS
March 1998­2000 – Moonlight Maze
Cyber attacks dubbed ‘Moonlight Maze’ targeted
computers at the Pentagon, NASA, the US Energy
Department, research laboratories and private
universities. The attackers successfully gained
access to tens of thousands of files. (Arquila, 2003)
(Central Intelligence Agency, 2007)
August 2006­2007 – US Congressmen
The office computer networks of two congressmen
were reportedly compromised. Information is
believed to have been stolen about dissidents critical
of the Beijing regime. (The Washington Times, 2008)
29 October 2007 ­ Oak Ridge National Laboratory
Oak Ridge National Laboratory was successfully
targeted using emails that were socially engineered
to appear as though they were legitimate official
communications. Computers were compromised, as
was a database which contained information about
visitors to the facility. The hackers are believed to
have stolen data from the database. (Oak Ridge
National Laboratory, 2007)
9 November 2007 – Los Alamos National Laboratory
Los Alamos National Laboratory advised all
employees of a recent malicious hacking event that
affected a small number of computers on the
laboratory’s unclassified ‘Yellow’ network. A
significant amount of unclassified data was stolen.
The attack is believed to have been part of a broader,
coordinated attack against US laboratories and other
institutions. (Anastasio, 2007) (Snodgrass, 2007)
(Goodin, 2007)
Early 2008 – US Department of Defense
The US Department of Defense suffered a significant
compromise of both unclassified and classified
military computer networks after a foreign
intelligence agency placed malicious software on a
USB flash drive. The device infected a US military
laptop upon insertion. The malicious code then
propagated through US networks infecting
numerous computers. (Lynn III, 2010)

September 2008 – Office of His Holiness the Dalai
Lama
A legitimate email was intercepted in transit to the
Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama (OHHDL) and
the attachment replaced with a file containing
malicious content. This attack appeared to be part of
a concerted effort in which hackers used social
engineering techniques to gain access to the OHHDL
computer network. The hackers appear to have
obtained user passwords through the intrusion and
later used these to remotely access the OHHDL mail
server. (Nagaraja & Anderson, 2009)
29 March 2009 – GhostNet
Researchers released a report detailing a cyber
espionage operation dubbed ‘GhostNet’ which
infiltrated at least 1295 computers in 103 countries,
including those belonging to embassies, South Asian
governments and the Dalai Lama. (Secdev, 2009)
June 2009 – Stuxnet
First known targeting of an unnamed organisation
occurred using the Stuxnet 4 worm. The organisation
was again targeted in March and April 2010.
Numerous other organisations, primarily in Iran,
were also targeted. The worm appears to have been
part of a coordinated effort to reprogram a specific
industrial control system, such as a gas pipeline or
power plant, likely located in Iran. (Farlliere, O
Muchu, & Chien, 2011) (U.S Office of
Counterintelligence, 2011)
November 2009 – Night Dragon
Starting in November, coordinated covert and
targeted cyber attacks were observed against global
oil and petrochemical companies. These attacks,
labelled as ‘Night Dragon’, used socially engineered
emails along with Microsoft Windows operating
system vulnerabilities to gain access to computers.
Using the access obtained the hackers accessed
information on operational oil and gas field
production systems and financial documents
relating to field exploration and bidding. (McAfee
Foundation Professional Services and McAfee Labs,
2011)

Mid December 2009 – Operation Aurora
Google detected a highly sophisticated and targeted
attack on Google corporate infrastructure that
resulted in the theft of intellectual property. This
event is believed to have been part of a coordinated
attack, known as ‘Operation Aurora’, in which
hackers sought source code from Google, Adobe
Systems and dozens of other high profile companies.
(Drummond, 2010) (Zetter, 2010)
2010 – Australian Resource Sector
Three major Australian resource sector companies
(BHP Billiton, Fortescue Metals Group and Rio Tinto)
were targeted by cyber attacks. Targeting of Rio
Tinto’s computer network occurred around the time
of the arrest of Stern Hu in July 2010. (AAP, 2010)
December 2010­March 2011 – French Government
The French Government was successfully targeted
by a socially engineered email campaign. Over 150
computers in the French Ministry of Economy and
Finance’s
Central
Services
division
were
compromised. The hackers were able to remotely
control the ministry’s computers and retrieve
documents for over three months. The hackers
sought documents related to the French presidency
of the G20 and international economic affairs. (Walid
Berissoul et agencies, 2011) (AFP, 2011)
January 2011 – Canadian Government
Canadian Government departments were targeted
using emails socially engineered to appear as though
they were sent from senior staff members within the
departments. The emails contained malicious
attachments
that
compromised
Canadian
Government computers and resulted in the theft of
classified information. (Postmedia News, 2011)
February­March 2011 – Australian Government
Australian parliamentary computers were accessed
over a period of at least one month. During that time
several thousand emails may have been accessed
including those of the Australian Prime Minister,
Foreign Minister and Defence Minister. (Benson,
2011)

4 The Stuxnet worm is a malicious computer program capable of

replicating itself to infect multiple linked computer systems.

15 March 2011 – Comodo Affiliated Root Authority

26 May 2011 – Northrop Grumman

A Comodo affiliated digital certificate Root Authority
(RA) was compromised resulting in the issue of
fraudulent SSL certificates for the popular domains:
mail.google.com, www.google.com, login.yahoo.com,
login.skype.com, addons.mozilla.org, login.live.com
and global trustee. (Comodo, 2011)

Northrop Grumman reportedly shut down remote
access to its network without warning and
conducted an organisation wide password reset,
raising speculation that it had also been targeted
using information stolen from RSA. (Kaplan, 2011)

17 March 2011 – RSA
RSA released a public statement advising that they
were recently targeted via socially engineered
emails containing malicious attachments that
exploited a zero day Adobe Flash vulnerability.
Hackers successfully gained access to the network
and exfiltrated information including that related to
RSA’s SecurID two­factor authentication products.
The stolen information was later used to enable
targeting of defence contractors. (Coviello, Open
Letter to RSA Customers, 2011)

May­June 2011 – International Monetary Fund
At least one International Monetary Fund (IMF)
computer was compromised in a large and
sophisticated cyber attack that involved significant
reconnaissance and utilised software written
specifically to target the IMF. The compromised
computer was used to access internal systems and
files. The hackers’ access could have given them
visibility of sensitive economic and political
information. (Reddy, Gorman, & Perez, 2011; Sanger
& Markoff, 2011) (The Guardian, 2011)

Mid April 2011 – Oak Ridge National Laboratory
Oak Ridge National Laboratory was targeted with
socially engineered emails tailored to appear as
though they were from the laboratory’s Human
Resources department. The emails tricked recipients
into downloading malicious software that exploited
a zero day vulnerability in Internet Explorer. The
laboratory shut down all internet access and email
systems from April 15 to April 17 to ensure no data
was exfiltrated before the infection could be cleaned
up. No large scale exfiltration of data is known to
have occurred. (Munger, 2011)
6 April 2011 – L­3 Communications
An L­3 Communications executive notified
employees that the company had been actively
targeted leveraging information stolen from RSA the
month prior. (gHale, 2011) (Poulsen, 2011)
21 May 2011 – Lockheed Martin
Lockheed Martin detected a cyber attack on its
computer network. The company’s information
security team took aggressive actions to protect the
systems. No exfiltration of data is known to have
occurred. RSA has publicly stated that information
stolen from it in March was used as an element of
the attack on Lockheed Martin. (Lockheed Martin
Corporation, 2011) (Coviello, Open Letter to RSA
SecurID Customers, 2011)

THE CURRENT CYBER THREAT ENVIRONMENT
APTs have targeted governments around the world,
global oil, energy, and petrochemical companies, the
mining sector, financial institutions, military
contractors, the science and technology sector,
dissidents, critical infrastructure and likely many
additional sectors. They have also targeted
technology companies that could enable future
targeting. The Operation Aurora attacks, the Comodo
affiliated RA compromise and the RSA attack set a
precedent for such targeting.

are the most common social engineering technique
used but not the only one. Secondly, it tells us
technology companies need to be better prepared to
protect sensitive information that can be used to
negatively affect the security of their customers and
business partners, and undermine the security
safeguards put in place.

The Aurora attacks appear to have been carried
out to provide the attacker with source code and
other information that may allow them to develop
zero day exploits and rootkits 5 for use on their
targets. The certificates generated in the Root
Authority attack would likely be of use for future
state­driven attacks (despite a lone Iranian
individual claiming full responsibility for the attack,
and stating that there was no government
involvement (Kobie, 2011)). The attack against RSA
appears to have been conducted to gather sensitive
information
to
facilitate
attacks
against
organisations that use RSA security tokens for two
factor authentication; including US defence
contractors who work on classified projects.
Based on the trend toward the targeting of
enabling companies and the increasing popularity of
virtualisation, VMware Inc. and other virtualisation
companies seem likely to be among companies
targeted by APTs in the future. If unknown
vulnerabilities in VMware software were discovered
it could have far reaching ramifications, affecting the
security of other companies. Especially given the
increased popularity of cloud computing which often
uses virtualisation to separate data belonging to
different customers. It could also make it easier for
malicious software to escape from virtualised
analysis platforms and infect connected systems.
Even though details of APT attacks are scarce in
the media, the released information is quite
informative. Firstly, it tells us that humans are often
the weakest link in the security chain and that users
need to be better educated on the threat from social
engineering. Socially engineered email campaigns
5 Rootkits

consist of software designed to hide an attacker’s
presence on a computer system. They can change the way
malicious programs are seen by the operating system, making it
blind to the presence of the malicious programs.

ANATOMY OF AN ATTACK
Figure 2 shows us that the most common attack
vector observed is socially engineered emails
frequently, but not always, used in combination with
zero day exploits. While most victims do not provide
many details about the attacks against them, RSA 6 is
one of the few that has provided quite detailed
information. The attack methodology observed in
the case of RSA appears to be quite typical. The
distinct attack phases are shown in simplified form
in Figure 3. (Rivner, 2011)

techniques to target their intended victim. This may
include scanning to determine vulnerabilities,
writing malicious code or acquiring code, drafting
socially engineered emails, determining which email
account to send socially engineered emails from,
acquiring necessary hardware (such as USB flash
drives), determining what infrastructure to use to
launch the attack and for command and control
communications, registering for and setting up
necessary accounts (email addresses, callback
domains etc.) and conducting testing.
Targeting

Reconnaisance

Maintenance

Preparation

Data Gathering

Targeting

The attacker launches their attack and monitors for
signs of compromise or failure. The sender may
attempt to connect remotely to a server to exploit a
vulnerability, strategically place a USB flash drive or
give one to a target, send socially engineered emails
and if possible, check for bounce back notifications,
monitor command and control infrastructure for
beaconing activity from the victim, try to connect
inbound to the potentially compromised computer,
or await feedback from an insider.
Further Access

Further Access

FIGURE 3 ­ BASIC APT ATTACK METHODOLOGY

Reconnaissance
The attacker passively gathers information about
their target to identify the best targeting method.
This may include research into the location of the
target’s offices, the location of their computers,
technologies used by the company, how they
communicate (between offices, with customers,
suppliers and shareholders), their employees, their
employees’ contact details, interests and contacts.
Preparation
The attacker actively prepares for the attack,
developing and testing appropriate tools and

Once an attacker has successfully gained access to a
computer network they will usually try to identify
where in the network they are and move laterally
within the network to access data of interest and to
install additional backdoors. This will usually
require a return to step 2 (Preparation) and step 3
(Targeting), the upload of tools and malicious
software, privilege escalation, network enumeration
and identification of vulnerable hosts on which to
install backdoors. It may also involve gaining access
to the domain controller to obtain password hashes,
covering tracks by altering logs, and accessing mail
or file servers to enable data gathering.
Data Gathering
Once an attacker has identified information of
interest they will try to gather this information and
exfiltrate it. They may do this using a ‘smash and
grab’ approach, trying to exfiltrate the desired data
before it is detected, or they may opt for a ‘low and
slow’ approach in which they exfiltrate the data in
small quantities over a longer period.

6 The attack on RSA is described in a blog post on the official RSA

blog site; see http://blogs.rsa.com/rivner/anatomy­of­an­attack/

Maintenance

Network Access Restrictions

Once an attacker has gained access to a network for
information gathering purposes they will usually
attempt to maintain their access. This may involve
minimising the amount of malicious activity they
generate on the network to avoid detection,
periodically communicating with backdoors on the
network to ensure they are working as intended,
and making changes as appropriate. If automated
data gathering tools are in use, it may also involve
modifying search terms or the exfiltration path,
volume or frequency. Maintenance also requires
maintaining callback domains and any intermediary
infrastructure used to communicate with the
backdoors. If access is lost, the attacker may return
to step 1 (Reconnaissance) or step 2 (Preparation)
in an attempt to regain access.

Restrict which computers can be placed on the
corporate network via wired, wireless, and remote
access methods.

IMPROVING ORGANISATIONAL RESILIENCE
To improve resilience to APTs organisations should
employ good security practices and policies
including those described below.
Information Centric Security
Adopt an information centric approach to security
by applying multiple layers of security, affording the
most sensitive information the most protection. If
possible store sensitive information offline, or on a
separate restricted access network.
Regular Patching
Regularly patch operating systems and applications
including document viewers (e.g. Microsoft Office,
Adobe Acrobat) and web browser plugins.

Known Network Topology
Ensure system administrators are aware of the
location of all computers, computer equipment and
Internet gateways so they can secure the network
(including wireless access points and 3G USB
modems).
USB Drive Control
Restrict which USB drives can be used on corporate
networks and develop policies on permitted usage
and minimum encryption requirements.
Intrusion Analysis
Conduct intrusion analysis (both host­based and
network based) to detect anomalous activity.
Access Control
Employ two­factor authentication where possible,
particularly on Virtual Private Networks. Restrict
user access using least privilege methodology,
encourage good password control, regularly audit
access logs, and review access levels.
Sender Policy Framework
Employ the Sender Policy Framework 7 to help
protect against spoofed emails.

Computer Administration Restrictions
Minimise administrative access and restrict access
so users do not possess both ‘write’ and ‘execute’
privileges for the same folder.
User Education
Educate users on the threat from socially engineered
emails and other forms of social engineering.
Encourage users to notify IT staff of suspicious
events.
7 The Sender Policy Framework is an open standard specifying a

technical method to prevent sender address forgery. (Mehnle,
2010)
