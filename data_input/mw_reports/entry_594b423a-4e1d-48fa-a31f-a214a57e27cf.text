Mabna Institute Hackers Penetrated Systems Belonging to Hundreds
of Universities, Companies, and Other Victims to Steal Research,
Academic and Proprietary Data, and Intellectual Property
An Indictment charging Gholamreza Rafatnejad, 38; Ehsan Mohammadi, 37; Abdollah
Karima, aka Vahid Karima, 39; Mostafa Sadeghi, 28; Seyed Ali Mirkarimi, 34; Mohammed
Reza Sabahi, 26; Roozbeh Sabahi, 24; Abuzar Gohari Moqadam, 37; and Sajjad Tahmasebi,
30, all citizens and residents of Iran, was unsealed today. The defendants were each
leaders, contractors, associates, hackers-for-hire or affiliates of the Mabna Institute, an Iranbased company that, since at least 2013, conducted a coordinated campaign of cyber
intrusions into computer systems belonging to 144 U.S. universities, 176 universities across
21 foreign countries, 47 domestic and foreign private sector companies, the U.S. Department
of Labor, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the State of Hawaii, the State of
Indiana, the United Nations, and the United Nations Children’s Fund. Through the
defendants’ activities, the Mabna Institute stole more than 31 terabytes of academic data and
intellectual property from universities, and email accounts of employees at private sector
1/4

companies, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations. The defendants
conducted many of these intrusions on behalf of the Islamic Republic of Iran’s (Iran) Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), one of several entities within the government of Iran
responsible for gathering intelligence, as well as other Iranian government and university
clients. In addition to these criminal charges, today the Department of the Treasury’s Office
of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated the Mabna Institute and the nine defendants
for sanctions for the malicious cyber-enabled activity outlined in the Indictment.
The charges were announced by Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein; Assistant
Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers; U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman
for the Southern District of New York; FBI Director Christopher A. Wray; Assistant Director in
Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. of the FBI’s New York Field Division; and Treasury Under
Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Sigal Mandelker.
“These nine Iranian nationals allegedly stole more than 31 terabytes of documents and data
from more than 140 American universities, 30 American companies, five American
government agencies, and also more than 176 universities in 21 foreign countries,” said
Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein. “For many of these intrusions, the defendants acted at
the behest of the Iranian government and, specifically, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard
Corps. The Department of Justice will aggressively investigate and prosecute hostile actors
who attempt to profit from America’s ideas by infiltrating our computer systems and stealing
intellectual property. This case is important because it will disrupt the defendants’ hacking
operations and deter similar crimes.”
“Today, in one of the largest state-sponsored hacking campaigns ever prosecuted by the
Department of Justice, we have unmasked criminals who normally hide behind the ones and
zeros of computer code,” said U.S. Attorney Berman. “As alleged, this massive and brazen
cyber-assault on the computer systems of hundreds of universities in 22 countries and
dozens of private sector companies and governmental organizations was conducted on
behalf of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard. The hackers targeted innovations and
intellectual property from our country’s greatest minds. These defendants are now fugitives
from American justice, no longer free to travel outside Iran without risk of arrest. The only
way they will see the outside world is through their computer screens, but stripped of their
greatest asset – anonymity.”
“This investigation involved a complex threat in a dynamic landscape, but today’s
announcement highlights the commitment of the FBI and our partners to vigorously pursue
those that threaten U.S. property and security,” said Director Wray. “Today, not only are we
publicly identifying the foreign hackers who committed these malicious cyber intrusions, but
we are also sending a powerful message to their backers, the Government of the Islamic
Republic of Iran: your acts do not go unnoticed. We will protect our innovation, ideas and
information, and we will use every tool in our toolbox to expose those who commit these
cyber crimes. Our memory is long; we will hold them accountable under the law, no matter
where they attempt to hide.”

According to the allegations contained in the Indictment unsealed today in Manhattan federal
court:
Background on the Mabna Institute
Gholamreza Rafatnejad and Ehsan Mohammadi, the defendants, founded the Mabna
Institute in approximately 2013 to assist Iranian universities and scientific and research
organizations in stealing access to non-Iranian scientific resources. In furtherance of its
mission, the Mabna Institute employed, contracted, and affiliated itself with hackers-for-hire
and other contract personnel to conduct cyber intrusions to steal academic data, intellectual
property, email inboxes and other proprietary data, including Abdollah Karima, aka Vahid
Karima, Mostafa Sadeghi, Seyed Ali Mirkarimi, Mohammed Reza Sabahi, Roozbeh Sabahi,
Abuzar Gohari Moqadam, and Sajjad Tahmasebi. The Mabna Institute contracted with both
Iranian governmental and private entities to conduct hacking activities on their behalf, and
specifically conducted the university spearphishing campaign on behalf of the IRGC. The
Mabna Institute is located at Tehran, Sheikh Bahaii Shomali, Koucheh Dawazdeh Metri
Sevom, Plak 14, Vahed 2, Code Posti 1995873351.
University Hacking Campaign
The Mabna Institute, through the activities of the defendants, targeted more than 100,000
accounts of professors around the world. They successfully compromised approximately
8,000 professor email accounts across 144 U.S.-based universities, and 176 universities
located in foreign countries, including Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, Germany,
Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Singapore, South Korea,
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Kingdom. The campaign started in
approximately 2013, continued through at least December 2017, and broadly targeted all
types of academic data and intellectual property from the systems of compromised
universities. Through the course of the conspiracy, U.S.-based universities spent more than
approximately $3.4 billion to procure and access such data and intellectual property.
The members of the conspiracy used stolen account credentials to obtain unauthorized
access to victim professor accounts, which they used to steal research, and other academic
data and documents, including, among other things, academic journals, theses,
dissertations, and electronic books. The defendants targeted data across all fields of
research and academic disciplines, including science and technology, engineering, social
sciences, medical, and other professional fields. The defendants stole at least approximately
31.5 terabytes of academic data and intellectual property, which they exfiltrated to servers
outside the United States that were under the control of members of the conspiracy.
In addition to stealing academic data and login credentials for the benefit of the Government
of Iran, the defendants also sold the stolen data through two websites, Megapaper.ir
(Megapaper) and Gigapaper.ir (Gigapaper). Megapaper was operated by Falinoos
Company, a company controlled by Abdollah Karima, aka Vahid Karima, the defendant, and
3/4

Gigapaper was affiliated with Karima. Megapaper sold stolen academic resources to
customers within Iran, including Iran-based public universities and institutions, and
Gigapaper sold a service to customers within Iran whereby purchasing customers could use
compromised university professor accounts to directly access the online library systems of
particular U.S.-based and foreign universities.
Accompanying Mitigation Efforts
Prior to the unsealing of the Indictment, the FBI provided foreign law enforcement partners
with detailed information regarding victims within their jurisdictions, so that victims in foreign
countries could be notified and foreign partners could assist in remediation efforts.
Also, in connection with the unsealing of the Indictment, today the FBI provided private
sector partners detailed information regarding the vulnerabilities targeted and the intrusion
vectors used by the Mabna Institute in their campaign against private sector companies.
This information will assist the public in its network defense and mitigation efforts.
