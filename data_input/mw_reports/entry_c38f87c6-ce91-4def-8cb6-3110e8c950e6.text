Over the past few weeks Jean-Piere Lesueur, A.K.A. DarkCoderSc, has been developing a
new version of the Dark Comet Remote Administration Tool which he is calling “Dark Comet
Legacy.” This newer version of the tool includes numerous features that make the tool more
user-friendly and appear more legitimate. In addition, DarkCoderSc continues to include
notices and required agreements that advise against using his tool for malicious purposes.
He also mentions that if it IS used for evil, that he is not liable for any damages done. In this
blog we will look at this new version of DC as well as look at how earlier versions used in the
past, and whether you should be concerned by this new version.

Dark Comet’s Past
If you have kept up with my blogs, you know that I have mentioned Dark Comet numerous
times. These blog posts talk about the previous version of Dark Comet that included a
server binary creator that could be used to infect a system without the user ever knowing
about it. Other blogs mentioned how it was used in such ways as an espionage tool in the
conflicts in Syria and a mention about how DarkCoderSc announced the retirement of Dark
Comet because of its use as a malicious tool.

In addition to its political past, Dark Comet was most used to steal information and spy on
unsuspecting users by both amateur and professional cyber criminals. Although, throughout
its entire past, DarkCoderSc continued to discourage malicious use of his tool that he
provided free.

Dark Comet Legacy
As mentioned in the introduction, DarkCoderSc has released a new version of Dark Comet
known as Dark Comet: Legacy. This new version is designed much more like legitimate
software to be used by the average computer user.

The Dark Comet Legacy Viewer Interface

One of the more user-friendly features is the brand new installers included with both the RAT
controller/client and the server module. This makes it more user-friendly because the
average user can just double click the installers, install the software and even be able to find
the controller application in the Start Menu. As far as the module goes, using the traditional
approach by using an installer application makes it difficult for the novice attacker to try to
hide the installation of the application as with the previous version of Dark Comet that could
be installed by only executing the binary.

In addition, the server module includes a GUI that makes it easy for the user to configure a
callback address on the fly rather than needing to recreate another binary with new
instructions. The use of the GUI also makes it more difficult to hide the use of the server
module from an unsuspecting user who might have had their system compromised via
physical means or otherwise.

Dark Comet Legacy Server Module GUI

Dark Comet Legacy includes all the same functionality of the original Dark Comet, with the
exception of the “Fun Functions” making it less of a tool to pull pranks on people with and
more a legitimate system-monitoring tool. You could compare Dark Comet Legacy to some of
the other legitimate system monitoring tools like TeamViewer; in addition, it has numerous
purposes to keep your information and your family safe.
It might be used to:
Keep an eye on your kids
Access your system remotely in case of being locked out
Remotely control systems on a private network
Have access to key-logging and webcam monitoring to know who might be using your
system if it is stolen.

Is it still a threat?
While there are numerous purposes for Dark Comet Legacy to be used as a legitimate
system-monitoring tool, it is in no way considered “Not a threat.” In fact, if you were to find
the server module running on your system, you should consider yourself compromised.
Numerous Anti-Malware and antivirus products will agree that Dark Comet Legacy can still
be used for malicious purposes, if not for its functionality than for the ability to undermine
DarkCoderSc’s good intentions. I will go over a few of ways in which DC Legacy can be used
in the same fashion as the original DC a little later and prove why it is necessary (at least for

3/5

now) to detect this tool as malware. DarkCoderSC and his company Phrozensoft
acknowledge this fact and advise disabling Anti-Malware/antivirus applications when using
DC Legacy.

Possible Infection Scenarios
Now that we have described what Dark Comet Legacy is capable of and how it can be used
legitimately as well as the reasons why it would be difficult for amateur cyber criminals to use
it to steal personal information or more, we will look into how this tool can be used
maliciously just as the original Dark Comet was.
Masked as a legitimate application
This method is commonly associated with Rogue AV products that claim to detect malicious
software on an otherwise clean system and when installed, infects the system with
subsequent malware. An attacker might target novice computer users, informing them that
DC Legacy is actually a tool that can help the user to remove malware or make their systems
run faster. This method requires a high amount of social engineering to accomplish and
being able to convince a novice to install malware themselves.
Installed along with other software
This method is often found within download site installers that are included along with
legitimate software from shady websites. Usually, these installers will add toolbars or
spyware to the system executing it. In this case, it could easily begin the installation process
for DC Legacy by explaining it as a necessary tool to make the intended application work
correctly.
Could be manually installed by other malware
The installation of malware by other malware is not a new thing, however it is possible for
one malware to manually install DC Legacy by modifying the registry settings, saving the
files and doing everything else the installer does for the user, automatically using the
malware. I can personally see this method as being used frequently by cyber-criminals
attempting to spread malware.

Conclusion
DarkCoderSc created the original Dark Comet with good intentions although it was abused
by cyber-criminals in order to steal personal information, spy on unsuspecting users and use
it for their own nefarious purposes without the user ever knowing. Dark Comet Legacy may
follow the same path as its predecessor, created with even more of a legitimate purpose in
mind however easily modified and molded to be used for malicious purposes. Check out the
reasons behind the re-birth of Dark Comet on the Phrozensoft blog:

The DC family is not the only set of tools created for legitimate purposes then abused by
cyber criminals; tools like Netcat, NetBus and even a tool like a telnet terminal can be used
for malicious purposes easily and therefore are often grouped into the malware or hacker
tool category. The tool itself, outside of full-blown malware, is often developed to make
things easier or give the user more power and control than they had before, some are
created for educational purposes and some are created for administration. However, at the
end of the day, it is in the intention of the tools user that determines whether it is used for evil
and if the possibility exists that a tool might be abused to cause harm to other users,
companies like Malwarebytes and others have no choice other than to protect their
customers from harm.
