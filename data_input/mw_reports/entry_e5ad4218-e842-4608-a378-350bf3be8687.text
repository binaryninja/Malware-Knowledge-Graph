Chinese APT10 intrusion activities target
Government, Cloud-Computing Managed Service
Providers and Customer networks worldwide.
The following information was obtained through FBI investigations and is
provided in accordance with the FBI's mission and policies to prevent and
protect against federal crimes and threats to the national security.
The FBI is providing the following information with HIGH confidence:

SUMMARY:
The FBI obtained information regarding a group of Chinese APT cyber actors
stealing high value information from commercial and governmental victims
in the U.S. and abroad. This Chinese APT group is known within private
sector reporting as APT10, Cloud Hopper, menuPass, Stone Panda, Red
Apollo, CVNX and POTASSIUM. This group heavily targets managed service
providers (MSP) who provide cloud computing services; commercial and
governmental clients of MSPs; as well as defense contractors and
governmental entities. APT10 uses various techniques for initial
compromise including spearphishing and malware. After initial compromise,
this group seeks MSP administrative credentials to pivot between MSP cloud
networks and customer systems to steal data and maintain persistence.
This group has also used spearphishing to deliver malicious payloads and
compromise victims.

TLP:WHITE

In addition to and through cloud-computing MSPs, APT10 targets victims in
the following areas:

Any activity related to APT10 detected on a network should be considered
an indication of a compromise requiring extensive mitigation and contact
with law enforcement.
The FBI is providing the following information with HIGH confidence:

TECHINICAL DETAILS:
APT10 uses custom tools which should be immediately flagged if detected,
reported to FBI CYWATCH, and given highest priority for enhanced
mitigation. The presence of such tools is typically part of a comprehensive,
multifaceted effort to maintain persistent network access and exfiltrate
data. The custom tools used by this group are as follows:
REDLEAVES
The REDLEAVES implant is a remote access Trojan (RAT) which
operates largely in memory with functionality suitable for system
enumeration and lateral movement within victim networks. Industry
reporting provides REDLEAVES may be used in spearphishing
campaigns as an intrusion vector. REDLEAVES source code shares

TLP:WHITE

commonalities with TROCHILUS RAT. Variants of REDLEAVES include
HIMAWARI and LAVENDER malware.
REDLEAVES comprises an executable file (EXE), custom loader (DLL)
and an encoded data file (DAT) containing shellcode and the
REDLEAVES DLL. Upon execution of the EXE file, the custom loader
DLL is side-loaded and conducts a function call to load and decode an
XOR encoded data file containing (a) stage-one shellcode, (b) stagetwo shellcode and (c) the REDLEAVES DLL. The stage-one shellcode
launches “svchost.exe” to process hollow the stage-two shellcode;
stage-two shellcode, in turn, allocates memory in “svchost.exe” to
load REDLEAVES DLL. After the REDLEAVES DLL runs, the EXE file
process terminates.
REDLEAVES is able to utilize a named pipe to execute commands in
remote shell or, alternatively, pass instructions through “cmd.exe” to
execute commands directly in the command shell. Basic REDLEAVES
functionality includes victim system enumeration, file
search/deletion, screenshots, as well as data transmission. Prior to
transmission, REDLEAVES compresses raw data with MiniLZO and
encrypts said data with RC4 encryption. REDLEAVES is able to
communicate with command and control (C2) servers on
HTTP/HTTPS or custom TCP protocols across ports 53, 80, 443 and
995.
Although REDLEAVES operates in memory to avoid detection, early
versions may not conduct anti-forensics; evidence, therefore, of files
copied to/from an infected host may still be present on disk. If a
machine is believed to be infected, it is recommended to examine for
“svchost.exe” processes which do not have “services.exe” as parent;
“svchost.exe” memory pages mapped as read-write-execute (RWX);
as well as reviewing forensic memory capture for anomalies
commonly associated with malicious processes.
UPPERCUT/ANEL
UPPERCUT, also known as ANEL, is a backdoor Trojan used in
spearphishing campaigns to deploy second-stage payloads such as
credential harvesters. Industry reporting states APT10 deploys
UPPERCUT through decoy Word documents containing a malicious
Visual Basic macro (VBA). UPPERCUT is known to exploit CVE-2017-

TLP:WHITE

8759 and CVE-2017-1182. It may be detected by antivirus engines as
“TROJ_ANELLDR”, “BKDR_ANELENC”,
“APT.Backdoor.Win.UPPERCUT” and/or
“FE_APT_Backdoor_Win32_UPPERCUT”.
Installation commences when the victim user enables the Word
document macro, resulting in the download of three Privacy
Enhanced Mail (PEM) text files. These PEM files are decoded with
“certutil.exe” to produce an EXE, DLL and DAT containing shellcode
and the UPPERCUT DLL. Upon execution of the EXE file, the custom
loader DLL is side-loaded and conducts a function call to load and
decrypt the shellcode; the shellcode decodes and decompresses the
UPPERCUT DLL. After the UPPERCUT DLL runs in memory, the PEM
files are deleted with “esentutle.exe”.
UPPERCUT is known to use Blowfish encryption when
communicating with C2 servers. UPPERCUT communicates with C2
servers through HTTP GET or POST requests. UPPERCUT initially
collects victim computer information, such as hostname and OS
version, and then aggregates and encrypts the data into a string
embedded within the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) of HTTP
requests. Upon receiving an initial request, the C2 server will
respond with an HTTP status response; if no C2 response is given,
UPPERCUT may resend the HTTP request with a “GetLastError” code
contained within the Cookie header. Subsequent commands and
modules between the C2 servers and UPPERCUT are Blowfish
encrypted and then embedded within the body of HTTP requests or
responses. Basic functionality includes the ability to execute
commands, upload/download files, load executables and take
screenshots.
CHCHES
CHCHES, also known as CHINESE CHESS, is a RAT which
communicates with C2 servers using HTTP Cookie headers. Industry
reporting provides CHCHES may be used in spearphishing campaigns
as an initial intrusion vector designed to deploy second-stage
payloads. The CHCHES EXE is known to disguise itself with a Word
icon or shortcut, as well as use expired or revoked certificates.

TLP:WHITE

CHCHES initially collects victim computer hostname; process
identifier (PID); current working directory (%TEMP%); screen
resolution; as well as kernel32.dll or explorer.exe version. This data
is aggregated into a string, encrypted and embedded within the
Cookie header of an HTTP GET or POST request and beaconed to a C2
server. The C2 server responds with a HTTP status response
containing a unique identifier within the “Set-Cookie” tag. After a
second HTTP GET beacon is sent containing the unique identifier
encrypted and embedded within the Cookie header, the C2 server
will transmit modules and commands. CHCHES modules loaded onto
memory include the ability to execute commands, upload/download
files, load and run DLLs, as well as encrypt communications using AES
encryption.
APT10 also acquires legitimate credentials and uses commonly available
tools as part of their effort to maintain persistent network access.
Mitigation efforts should also focus on identifying such access and removing
it. FBI has identified the following specific, but not wholly exclusive,
malware and tools previously used by this group:


QUASAR RAT

Please see APPENDIX A and APPENDIX B for technical indicators and
indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with this APT.

TLP:WHITE

RECOMMENDED STEPS FOR INITIAL MITIGATION:
The FBI recommends the following mitigation measures be taken within the
first 72 hours of detection:
Prepare Your Environment for Incident Response









Establish Out-of-Band Communications methods for dissemination of
intrusion response plans and activities, inform network operations
centers (NOCs) and computer emergency response teams (CERTs)
according to institutional policy and SOPs
Maintain and actively monitor centralized host and network logging
solutions after ensuring all devices have logging enabled and their
logs are being aggregated to those centralized solutions
Disable all remote (including remote desktop protocol and virtual
private network) access until a password change with two-factor
authentication has been completed
Implement full secure socket layer (SSL) / transport layer security
(TLS) inspection capability (on perimeter and proxy devices)
Monitor accounts and devices determined to be part of the
compromise to prevent reacquisition attempts
Collect forensic images including memory capture of devices
determined to be part of the compromise.

Implement core mitigations to prevent re-exploitation (within 72 hours)
Implement a network-wide password reset with two-factor authentication
(preferably with local host access only, no remote changes allowed) to
include:




All domain accounts (especially high-privileged administrators)
Local Accounts
Machine and System Accounts

Patch all systems for critical vulnerabilities:
A patch management process which regularly patches vulnerable software
remains a critical component in raising the difficulty of intrusions for cyber
operators. While a few adversaries use zero-day exploits to target victims,
many adversaries still target known vulnerabilities for which patches have
been released, capitalizing on slow patch processes and risk decisions by

TLP:WHITE

network owners not to patch certain vulnerabilities or systems. A few of
these targeted vulnerabilities include the following:


CVE-2018-8174
CVE-2017-8759
CVE-2017-1182
CVE-2017-0199

While watching for infections from the malware families detailed above, we
also recommend ensuring you are patched against older vulnerabilities
commonly exploited by cyber operators, such as CVE-2012-0158.
After initial response activities, deploy and properly configure a mitigation
tool kit such as Microsoft's Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET).
EMET employs several mitigations techniques to combat memory corruption
techniques. It is recommended all hosts and servers on the network
implement mitigation toolkits.
