Executive Summary
SecurityScorecard (SSC) has identified three separate DDoS attacks which all targeted
Ukrainian government and financial websites leading up to and during Russia’s
invasion of Ukraine. Details of these DDoS attacks have not yet been publicly
identified.
SSC discovered a botnet of more than 3,000 unique IP addresses, across multiple
countries and continents, that were the source of the DDoS attacks which consisted of
HTTP floods and DNS amplification. SSC has named this botnet “Zhadnost” – Russian
for “Greed.”
Most Zhadnost bots are routers, the majority of them MikroTik, with misconfigured DNS
recursion settings and other known vulnerabilities.

The DDoS attacks appeared to have had a minimal, temporary impact on their targets.
Government websites and banking services were quickly restored and customers'
balances were not affected.
We assess that the IP addresses used in the first DDoS attack were a combination of
Zhadnost bots and other botnets possibly controlled by criminal actors, who partnered
with or were hired by the same threat actor. The second and third DDoS attacks used
only Zhadnost bots.
Attributing Zhadnost and the DDoS attacks to any one threat actor is difficult, however,
we assess with moderate confidence that Russia, or Russian-aligned actors, are likely
behind this DDoS campaign.
Background
On November 10, 2021, reports emerged of unusual movement of Russian troops near the
borders of Ukraine. By November 28, Ukraine reported a build up of 92,000 Russian troops.
In January 2022, Russian troops began arriving in Belarus for military exercises. Throughout
December 2021 and January 2022, a series of diplomatic talks took place between Russia,
NATO, and Ukraine during which Russia proposed limits on NATO’s activities in eastern
Europe, such as a prohibition on Ukraine ever joining NATO. NATO/Ukraine rejected these
proposals and warned Russia of strong economic and other measures should it invade
Ukraine. Russia continued to build up its forces along Ukraine’s border with Russia and
Belarus, and in the Black Sea. NATO and Western countries pledged their support to Ukraine
and began providing lethal and non-lethal military equipment, intelligence, and financial aid
to help Ukraine defend itself from Russian aggression.
On February 24, Russian President Putin announced he had decided to launch a “special
military operation” in Ukraine. Shortly thereafter, explosions were reported in several
Ukrainian cities and Russian military vehicles began crossing Ukrainian borders on several
fronts.
This whitepaper specifically discusses SecurityScorecard’s investigation into the use of
DDoS attacks against Ukrainian infrastructure leading up to and during Russia’s invasion of
Ukraine. We have identified three separate DDoS attacks which all targeted Ukrainian
government and financial websites in a likely effort to take them offline, thereby denying and
degrading access to news, information, and currency from official Ukrainian government and
financial sources.
Methodology
According to various open sources and media reports, as well as SecurityScorecard’s own
data, the following websites were targeted by DDoS attacks on three different occasions:
Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs - mfa.gov.ua
2/9

Ukrainian Ministry of Defence - mil.gov.ua
Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs - mvs.gov.ua
Security Service of Ukraine - ssu.gov.ua
Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers - kmu.gov.ua
Oschadbank - oschadbank.ua
Privatbank - privatbank.ua
We resolved the IP addresses of these domains and conducted netflow analysis for the
period corresponding with the DDoS attacks. From the available netflow results, we
discovered more than 3,000 unique IP addresses–spanning multiple countries and
continents–that were the source of the DDoS attacks. Of note, none of the IP addresses
involved in any of the observed DDoS attacks were located in Russia or Belarus. We then
conducted further research and analysis on the 50 most active IP addresses from each
attack using proprietary data enrichment techniques and open and closed intelligence
sources.
February 15 DDoS Attack
On February 15, 2022, Ukraine’s minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov,
announced that a cyberattack against the websites of Ukraine’s defense ministry and army,
as well as the interfaces of the country’s two largest banks, was the largest assault of its kind
in the country's history and “bore traces of foreign intelligence services.” Ilya Vityuk, the head
of the Ukrainian Intelligence Agency’s Cyber Security Department, blamed Russia for the
attack, citing as evidence that the attack likely cost “millions of dollars” to execute, far beyond
the capabilities of individual hackers or groups. He asserted that Russia is the only country
that is interested in such strikes on Ukraine.
From our analysis, SSC has identified more than 200 unique IP addresses that were
involved in the February 15 DDoS attack. The attack consisted of HTTPS flooding on port
443. This type of attack is designed to overwhelm a targeted server with HTTP requests.
Once the target has been saturated with requests and is unable to respond to normal traffic,
a denial-of-service will occur for additional requests from actual users. Analysis of the 50
most active IP addresses revealed that approximately half of them appear to be MikroTik
routers, or other devices running SquidProxy.
Our data also revealed that the majority of the IP addresses have previously been
associated with activity from the following implants:
Xorddos
Cobaltstrike
3/9

Amadey
Trickbot
Qakbot
Lokibot
Jedobot
Bluebot
Betabot
Gumblar
Kasidet
PonyLoader
Smokeloader
Unfortunately, SSC is not able to determine from the available data if the malicious HTTP
requests were sent from the router themselves, compromised hosts behind them, or a
combination of both. This makes attributing this particular attack to any one threat actor
extremely difficult. Our work here continues.
Fortunately, this attack appeared to have minimal impact on its targets. According to a
statement from Victor Zhora of the Ukrainian Center for Strategic Communications and
Information Security, Ukrainian cybersecurity officials managed to significantly reduce the
amount of harmful traffic to the websites. Furthermore, while the targeted banks confirmed
the attack, they indicated that users had only been temporarily unable to withdraw money
from their accounts. Banking services were quickly restored and customers’ balances were
not affected.
February 23 and 28 DDoS Attacks
On February 23, another DDoS attack against Ukrainian websites was again reported by
Mykhailo Fedorov.

SSC discovered another DDoS attack that took place between February 27 - 28 that was
largely unreported in the media, likely since such attacks were becoming commonplace at
this point.
From our analysis, SSC has identified more than 3,000 unique IP addresses that were
involved in DDoS attacks on February 23 and 27-28. Analysis of these IP addresses
revealed that the vast majority of them are running “MikroTik Bandwidth-test server” on port
2000, with a connection signature of \x01\x00\x00\x00, recursion enabled on UDP/TCP port
53, and multiple versions of MikroTik RouterOS services on various ports. Analysis of the 50
most active IPs from the second and third attacks revealed that 76% and 92%, respectively,
can be identified as MikroTik devices.

100% of the IPs we identified had DNS recursion enabled on port 53. SSC assesses that the
threat actor sent spoofed DNS requests to the MikroTik devices, which allowed DNS
recursion. The requests were then processed as valid and returned to the spoofed recipients,
in this case the targeted Ukrainian websites. This is known as an amplifier attack because
this method takes advantage of misconfigured DNS servers to reflect the attack onto a target
while amplifying the volume of packets. SSC has named the botnet used to conduct the
second and third DDoS attacks “Zhadnost”--Russian for “Greed.”

5/9

Zhadnost is somewhat similar to the Mēris botnet discovered by Russia-based companies
Yandex and Qrator Labs in 2021. Yandex/Qrator Labs reported that 90 to 95% of the Mēris
bots that had recently attacked Yandex with a DDoS attack had MikroTik Bandwidth Test
running on port 2000 with a connection signature of \x01\x00\x00\x00. According to a
different report released by NetScout on October 28, 2021, NetScout discovered that there
are at least two distinct MikroTik-based IoT botnets inhabiting the same population of
unpatched, exploitable MikroTik routers; Mēris, which uses HTTP Pipelining as a form of
attack, and a botnet called Dvinis (Latvian for “twin”), which does not. Instead, Dvinis uses an
apparent typo in the attack generator which appends an extra ‘/’ character to the end of the
URIs targeted in HTTP POST and GET floods.
In response to the Yandex/Qrator labs discovery, MikroTik released a report indicating
Mēris bots are MikroTik routers that were compromised in 2018, when MikroTik RouterOS
had a vulnerability that was quickly patched. There was no new vulnerability in RouterOS
and there was no malware hiding inside the RouterOS filesystem, rather the attacker was
reconfiguring RouterOS devices for remote access, using commands and features of
RouterOS itself. Unfortunately, closing the old vulnerability does not immediately protect
these routers.
Although MikroTik provided mitigation advice in its statement, it did not mention anything
about ensuring that DNS recursion was properly configured. But there is evidence that
MikroTik is aware of this vulnerability. According to MikroTik’s website, every MIkroTik that
has the“Allow-Remote-Requests” feature turned on is a potential attack vector, representing
a 1:179 bandwidth amplification factor.
Preliminary analysis using Qrator Labs’ Mēris identification tool has revealed that none of the
Zhadnost IP addresses are part of the Mēris botnet. No such identification tool for Dvinis
nodes exists. However, only the first attack consisted of HTTP floods, which Dvinis is known
for. Zhadnost bots don’t require a compromised router, simply a router with misconfigured
DNS recursion. Therefore, SSC assesses that it is also unlikely that Zhadnost IPs are part of
Dvinis. Thus, we believe they are a new botnet, controlled by a different actor.
The analysis of the 50 most active Zhadnost bots/MikroTik routers used in the second and
third attack has also revealed that several devices behind them have previously been
associated with activity from the following implants:
Amadey
Betabot
Gumblar
Lokibot

We assess that the implant activity is incidental, and not connected to the deployment of
Zhadnost bots.
To create Zhadnost, all the threat actor had to do was establish and maintain a list of
MikroTik and other devices with misconfigured DNS recursion settings, which would forward
spoofed requests to the targeted websites. This could be easily done using tools such as
Shodan and Google Dorks. According to our Attack Surface Intelligence Data, there are at
least 875,000 MikroTik devices located all over the world. This could potentially represent a
near infinite number of bots, provided DNS recursion is not properly configured on these
devices.

Attribution
Attributing Zhadnost and the DDoS attacks to any one threat actor is difficult, given that
anyone could have taken advantage of this misconfiguration with little effort. Furthermore, it
is difficult to differentiate the traffic from the router itself from the legitimate traffic of the
devices behind it, making identification of the command and control infrastructure extremely
difficult. However, taking into account the current geopolitical factors, and considering which
country is likely to gain from such attacks, SSC can assess with moderate confidence that
Russia, or Russian-aligned actors, are likely behind this DDoS campaign.
Key Insights
Despite the involvement of MikroTik devices in all three attacks, further comparison reveals
that the first attack is quite different from the second or third:

Figure 1: Comparison of three attacks.
Based on these differences, SSC assesses with moderate confidence that the IP addresses
used to conduct the second and third DDoS attacks against Ukrainian government and
financial websites were solely Zhadnost bots, meaning MikroTik and other routers with
misconfigured DNS recursion settings. We assess that the IP addresses used in the first
attack were a combination of Zhadnost bots and other botnets possibly controlled by criminal
actors, who partnered with or were hired by the same threat actor.
SSC also assesses with moderate confidence that the DDoS attacks had very limited impact
on their targets. This is likely a result of Ukraine being adequately prepared to handle such
attacks, since similar tactics had been used during previous attacks. Furthermore, various
Ukrainian officials have made public statements regarding Ukraine’s success in minimizing
the effects of attacks.
Outlook
So far, the DDoS attacks SSC has observed have been targeted towards government and
financial websites, and do not appear to have much of an impact. This leads to the possibility
that the threat actor will target more critical targets in the next attacks, such as networks
used for power generation, communications, and by hospitals and military units.
As the Russian military’s efforts become more aggressive to overcome the stiff Ukrainian
resistance, we expect the cyber attacks towards Ukraine to follow suit. We also expect to see
attacks on NATO and Western countries, in retaliation for the sanctions placed on Russia
and the aid provided to Ukraine.
Recommendations
SSC recommends that organizations check the DNS recursion settings in their routers,
whether they are MikroTik or another vendor. It is recommended that DNS recursion is
disabled if it is not required. If required, it should be configured to only conduct
recursion for trusted domains/hosts.

8/9

It is critical to put DDoS mitigations in place, via a service like Cloudflare, Akamai, or
AWS Cloudfront. Having a firewall will not stop the volume of traffic we have observed
against Ukrainian targets via netflow analysis.
Furthermore, blocking Russian IPs will not stop DDoS attacks. The attacks are coming
from across the world from neutral countries in Latin America, EU (not Russia or
Belarus), and southeast Asia.
