The SANS investigation into this incident should not be confused with the U.S. interagency team investigation or any other organization
or company’s efforts to include the E-ISAC’s past reporting. SANS ICS team has been analyzing the data on their own since December 25,
2015, and has provided its analysis to the wider community. This document is provided to E-ISAC and the North American electricity
sector to benefit its members and the larger critical infrastructure community.

Summary of Incidents
On December 23, 2015, the Ukrainian Kyivoblenergo, a regional electricity distribution company, reported
service outages to customers. The outages were due to a third party’s illegal entry into the company’s computer
and SCADA systems: Starting at approximately 3:35 p.m. local time, seven 110 kV and 23 35 kV substations were
disconnected for three hours. Later statements indicated that the cyber attack impacted additional portions of
the distribution grid and forced operators to switch to manual mode.2, 3 The event was elaborated on by the
Ukrainian news media, who conducted interviews and determined that a foreign attacker remotely controlled
the SCADA distribution management system.4 The outages were originally thought to have affected
approximately 80,000 customers, based on the Kyivoblenergo’s update to customers. However, later it was
revealed that three different distribution oblenergos (a term used to describe an energy company) were
attacked, resulting in several outages that caused approximately 225,000 customers to lose power across
various areas.5, 6
Shortly after the attack, Ukrainian government officials claimed the outages were caused by a cyber attack, and
that Russian security services were responsible for the incidents.7 Following these claims, investigators in
Ukraine, as well as private companies and the U.S. government, performed analysis and offered assistance to
determine the root cause of the outage.8 Both the E-ISAC and SANS ICS team was involved in various efforts and
analyses in relation to this case since December 25, 2015, working with trusted members and organizations in
the community.
This joint report consolidates the open source information, clarifying important details surrounding the attack,
offering lessons learned, and recommending approaches to help the ICS community repel similar attacks. This
report does not focus on attribution of the attack.

Summary of Information and Reporting
Background
On December 24, 2015, TSN (a Ukrainian news outlet) released the report “Due to a Hacker Attack Half of the
Ivano-Frankivsk Region is De-Energized.”9 Numerous reporting agencies and independent bloggers from the
Washington Post, SANS Institute, New York Times, ARS Technica, BBC, Wired, CNN, Fox News, and the E-ISAC
Report have followed up on the initial TSN report.10 These subsequent reports have collectively provided details
of a cyber attack that targeted the Ukrainian electric system. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
issued a formal report on February 25, 2016, titled IR-ALERT-H-16-056-01.11 Based on the DHS report, three
Ukrainian oblenergos experienced coordinated cyber attacks that were executed within 30 minutes of each
other. The attack impacted 225,000 customers and required the oblenergos to move to manual operations in
response to the attack.
The oblenergos were reportedly able to restore service quickly after an outage window lasting several hours.12
The DHS report states that, while electrical service was restored, the impacted oblenergos continue to operate
their distribution systems in an operationally constrained mode. Within the Ukrainian electrical system, these
attacks were directed at the regional distribution level, as shown in Figure 1.

Summary of Incidents

See the Appendix for an evaluation of the credibility and amount of technical information that is publicly
available.
Keeping Perspective
The cyber attacks in Ukraine are the first publicly acknowledged incidents to result in power outages. As future
attacks may occur, it is important to scope the impacts of the incident. Power outages should be measured in
scale (number of customers and amount of electricity infrastructure involved) and in duration to full restoration.
The Ukrainian incidents affected up to 225,000 customers in three different distribution-level service territories
and lasted for several hours. These incidents should be rated on a macro scale as low in terms of power system
impacts as the outage affected a very small number of overall power consumers in Ukraine and the duration was
limited. In contrast, it is likely that the impacted companies rate these incidents as high or critical to the
reliability of their systems and business operations.

Attacker Tactics Techniques and Procedures Description
Direct attribution is unnecessary to learn from this attack and to consider mitigation strategies; it is only
necessary to use the mental model of how the cyber actor works to understand the capabilities and general
profile against which one is defending. The motive and sophistication of this power grid attack is consistent with
a highly structured and resourced actor. This actor was co-adaptive and demonstrated varying tactics and
techniques to match the defenses and environment of the three impacted targets. The mitigation section of this
document provides mitigation concepts related to the attack and how to develop a more lasting mitigation
strategy by anticipating future attacks.
Capability
The attackers demonstrated a variety of capabilities, including spear phishing emails, variants of the BlackEnergy
3 malware, and the manipulation of Microsoft Office documents that contained the malware to gain a foothold
into the Information Technology (IT) networks of the electricity companies.13 They demonstrated the capability
to gain a foothold and harvest credentials and information to gain access to the ICS network. Additionally, the
attackers showed expertise, not only in network connected infrastructure; such as Uninterruptable Power
Supplies (UPSs), but also in operating the ICSs through supervisory control system; such as the Human Machine
Interface (HMI), as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2: Control & Operate: SCADA Hijacking Techniques
Finally, the adversaries demonstrated the capability and willingness to target field devices at substations, write
custom malicious firmware, and render the devices, such as serial-to-ethernet convertors, inoperable and

Attacker Tactics Techniques and Procedures Description

unrecoverable.14 In one case, the attackers also used telephone systems to generate thousands of calls to the
energy company’s call center to deny access to customers reporting outages. However, the strongest capability
of the attackers was not in their choice of tools or in their expertise, but in their capability to perform long-term
reconnaissance operations required to learn the environment and execute a highly synchronized, multistage,
multisite attack.
The following is a consolidated list of the technical components used by the attackers, graphically depicted in
Figure 3:
 Spear phishing to gain access to the business networks of the oblenergos
 Identification of BlackEnergy 3 at each of the impacted oblenergos
 Theft of credentials from the business networks
 The use of virtual private networks (VPNs) to enter the ICS network
 The use of existing remote access tools within the environment or issuing commands directly from a
remote station similar to an operator HMI
 Serial-to-ethernet communications devices impacted at a firmware level15
 The use of a modified KillDisk to erase the master boot record of impacted organization systems as well
as the targeted deletion of some logs16
 Utilizing UPS systems to impact connected load with a scheduled service outage
 Telephone denial-of-service attack on the call center

Figure 3: Ukraine Attack Consolidated Technical Components

At various points in the public reporting on the attack, organizations have indicated that BlackEnergy 3 and
KillDisk itself could be directly responsible for the outage. One of the items specifically highlighted to support

Attacker Tactics Techniques and Procedures Description

this theory was that KillDisk deleted a process on Windows systems linked to serial-to-ethernet
communications.17 Regardless of the impact of the SCADA network environment, neither BlackEnergy 3 nor
KillDisk contained the required components to cause the outage. The outages were caused by the use of the
control systems and their software through direct interaction by the adversary. All other tools and technology,
such as BlackEnergy 3 and KillDisk, were used to enable the attack or delay restoration efforts.
Opportunities
Multiple opportunities existed for the adversary to execute its attack. External to the oblenergos and prior to
the attack, there was a variety of open-source information available; including a detailed list of types of
infrastructure such as Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) vendors and versions posted online by ICS vendors.18 The
VPNs into the ICS from the business network appear to lack two-factor authentication. Additionally, the firewall
allowed the adversary to remote admin out of the environment by utilizing a remote access capability native to
the systems. In addition, based on media reporting, there did not appear to be any resident capability to
continually monitor the ICS network and search for abnormalities and threats through active defense measures;
like network security monitoring. These vulnerabilities would have provided the adversary the opportunity to
persist within the environment for six months or more to conduct reconnaissance on the environment and
subsequently execute the attack.19
Based on the details provided in the DHS report, the adversary used a consistent attack approach on all three
impacted targets. The adversary also used consistent tactics to impact field controllable elements and
irreparably damage field devices.
Why these oblenergos were targeted remains an open debate. Based on the public reporting, it is unknown if
the targets were selected based on common technologies in use, system architectures, reconnaissance
operations, or service territories. Opportunity-based considerations for selecting a specific target may focus on
an attacker’s confidence and ability to cause an ICS effect. Some example decision factors could include:


Targets with common systems and configurations



Multiple systems with common centralized control points



ICS impact duration estimates (e.g., long term or short term)



Existing capabilities required to achieve desired results



Risk level of performing the operation and being discovered



Achieved access and ability to move and act within the environment

ICS Cyber Kill Chain Mapping
The ICS Cyber Kill Chain was published by SANS in 2015 by Michael Assante and Robert M. Lee as an adaptation
of the traditional cyber kill chain developed by Lockheed Martin analysts as it applied to ICSs.20 The ICS Cyber Kill
Chain details the steps an adversary must follow to perform a high-confidence attack on the ICS process and/or
cause physical damage to equipment in a predictable and controllable way, as displayed in Figure 4.

Figure 4: The ICS Cyber Kill Chain with Stage 1 Highlighted
The attack on the Ukrainian power grid followed the ICS Cyber Kill Chain completely throughout Stage 1 and
Stage 2. The attack gained access to each level of the ICS, as shown in Figure 5, with the ICS Cyber Kill Chain
plotted alongside a segmentation/hierarchy model (e.g., modified Purdue Model). Completing Stage 1 entails a
successful cyber intrusion or breach into an ICS system, but is not characterized as an ICS attack. Completion of
Stage 2 completed the ICS Kill Chain, resulting in a successful cyber attack that led to an impact on the
operations of the ICS. The next section includes a discussion of the two stages using currently available
information from the attack.

ICS Cyber Kill Chain Mapping

Figure 5: Ukraine Cyber Attack ICS Cyber Kill Chain and Purdue Model Mapping21
ICS Cyber Kill Chain Mapping – Stage 1
The first step in Stage 1 is Reconnaissance. There were no reports of observed reconnaissance having taken
place prior to targeting the energy companies. However, an analysis of the three impacted organizations shows
they were particularly interesting targets due to the levels of automation in their distribution system; enabling
the remote opening of breakers in a number of substations. Additionally, the targeting and final attack plan for
the electricity companies in general were highly coordinated, which indicates that reconnaissance took place at
some point. This was very unlikely to have been an opportunistic attack.
The second step is Weaponization and/or Targeting. Targeting would normally take place when no
weaponization is needed; such as directly accessing internet connected devices. In this attack, it does not appear
that targeting of specific infrastructure was necessary to gain access. Instead, the adversaries weaponized
Microsoft Office documents (Excel and Word) by embedding BlackEnergy 3 within the documents.22 Samples of
Excel and other office documents have been recovered from the broader access campaign that targeted a
multitude of organizations in Ukraine; including Office documents used in the specific attack against the three
electricity companies.23, 24
During the cyber intrusion stage of Delivery, Exploit, and Install, the malicious Office documents were delivered

via email to individuals in the administrative or IT network of the electricity companies. When these documents
were opened, a popup was displayed to users to encourage them to enable the macros in the document as
shown in Figure 6.25 Enabling the macros allowed the malware to Exploit Office macro functionality to install
BlackEnergy 3 on the victim system and was not an exploit of a vulnerability through exploit code. There was no
observed exploit code in this incident. The theme of using available functionality in the system was present
throughout the adversary’s kill chain.

Figure 6: A Sample of a BlackEnergy 3 Infected Microsoft Office Document26
Upon the Install step, the BlackEnergy 3 malware connected to command and control (C2) IP addresses to
enable communication by the adversary with the malware and the infected systems. These pathways allowed
the adversary to gather information from the environment and enable access. The attackers appear to have
gained access more than six months prior to December 23, 2015, when the power outage occurred.27 One of
their first actions happened when the network was to harvest credentials, escalate privileges, and move laterally
throughout the environment (e.g., target directory service infrastructure to directly manipulate and control the
authentication and authorization system). At this point, the adversary completed all actions to establish
persistent access to the targets. While the initial footholds were used to harvest legitimate credentials for
pivoting and systematic takeover of IT systems and remote connections, it is likely that the attackers moved
quickly away from their initial footholds and vulnerable C2s in an effort to blend into the target’s systems as
authorized users. With this information, the attackers would be able to identify VPN connections and avenues
from the business network into the ICS network. Using native connections and commands allows the attackers
to discover the remainder of the systems and extract data necessary to formulate a plan for Stage 2.

ICS Cyber Kill Chain Mapping

Speculation
There was not enough publicly available
information to determine how diversified
the adversary’s attack was to include how
many different types of devices were
impacted at the firmware level. However,
through publicly available information
about the Ukrainian networks, as well as
knowledge of similar electric distribution
systems, it is likely that there was a diverse
hardware and software environment.

Using the stolen credentials, the adversary was able to pivot
into the network segments where SCADA dispatch
workstations and servers existed. Upon entry into the
network, the actions of the adversaries were consistent in
theme but different in technical minutia between the three
impacted oblenergoss. In at least one of the oblenergos, the
attackers discovered a network connected to a UPS and
reconfigured it so that when the attacker caused a power
outage, it was followed by an event that would also impact the
power in the energy company’s buildings or data
centers/closets.

There is not sufficient information available to identify if any
information was exfiltrated from the environment, but the
adversary demonstrated a capability in Stage 2 that indicates
internal discovery was performed. This reconnaissance would
have needed to include discovering field devices such as the
serial-to-ethernet devices used to interpret commands from
the SCADA network to the substation control systems.
Additionally, the three oblenergos used different distribution management systems (DMSs), and the attackers
would have needed to perform some network reconnaissance against these systems and find specific targets to
execute their highly coordinated attack.28
It is suspected that the administrative and
ICS networks contained multiple OS
versions such as Windows XP and Windows
7, multiple types of RTUs and gateways,
and various industrial switches.

ICS Cyber Kill Chain Mapping – Stage 2
In most cases, the Develop stage occurs in the adversary’s networks, thereby limiting any available forensic
information, but the attack that follows this stage can reveal a lot about the adversarial process. In the Attack
Development and Tuning Stage of Stage 2, the attackers executed the Develop step in at least two ways. First,
they learned how to interact with the three distinct DMS environments using the native control present in the
system and operator screens. Second, and more importantly, they developed malicious firmware for the serialto-ethernet devices.29
Currently available information indicates that the malicious firmware was consistent amongst devices and
uploaded within short periods of each other to multiple sites. Therefore, the malicious uploads of firmware was
likely developed prior to the attack for quick and predictable execution.
E-ISAC and the SANS ICS team assess with high confidence that, during the Validation Stage of Stage 2, the
adversary did Test their capabilities prior to their deployment. It is possible that the adversaries were able to
execute this with pure luck, but it is highly unlikely and inconsistent with the professionalism observed
throughout the rest of the attack. The adversaries likely had systems in their organization that they were able to
evaluate and test their firmware against prior to executing on December 23rd.

28

The three different DMS vendors were discoverable via open-source searching. The names of the vendors are being withheld as it is not
important to the discussion of the attack. There were no exploits leveraged against these vendors but they were simply abused with
direct access.

ICS Cyber Kill Chain Mapping

During the ICS Attack Stage, the adversaries used native software to Deliver themselves into the environment
for direct interaction with the ICS components. They achieved this using existing remote administration tools on
the operator workstations. The threat actors also continued to use the VPN access into the IT environment.30
In final preparation for the attack, the adversaries completed the Install/Modify stage by installing malicious
software identified as a modified or customized KillDisk across the environment. While it is likely the attackers
then ensured their modifications to the UPS were ready for the attack, there was not sufficient forensic
evidence available to prove this. The last act of modification was for the adversaries to take control of the
operator workstations and thereby lock the operators out of their systems. Figure 7 shows the static analysis of
the KillDisk API imports following the event.

Figure 7: Static Analysis of KillDisk Identifying API Imports31

Finally, to complete the ICS Cyber Kill Chain and to Execute the ICS Attack, the adversaries used the HMIs in the
SCADA environment to open the breakers. At least 27 substations (the total number is probably higher) were
taken offline across the three energy companies, impacting roughly 225,000 customers.32, 33 Simultaneously, the
attackers uploaded the malicious firmware to the serial-to-ethernet gateway devices. This ensured that even if

In analysis of the impact observed and on the available information on the Ukrainian distribution grid it is assessed with medium
confidence that the public number of disconnected substations, 27, is a low number.

the operator workstations were recovered, remote commands could not be issued to bring the substations back
online (We have characterized the firmware attacks against field communication devices as
“blowing the bridges”).
During this same period, the attackers also leveraged a remote telephonic denial of service on the energy
company’s call center with thousands of calls to ensure that impacted customers could not report outages.
Initially, it seemed that this attack was to keep customers from informing the operators of how extensive the
outages were; however, in review of the entirety of the evidence, it is more likely that the denial of service was
executed to frustrate the customers since they could not contact customer support or gain clarity regarding the
outage. The entire attack from March 2015 – December 23, 2015 is graphically depicted below in Figure 8.

ICS Cyber Kill Chain Mapping

It is extremely important to note that neither BlackEnergy 3, unreported backdoors, KillDisk, nor the malicious
firmware uploads alone were responsible for the outage. Each was simply a component of the cyber attack for
the purposes of access and delay of restoration. For example, on some systems, KillDisk made the Windows
systems inoperable by manipulating or deleting the master boot record, but on other systems it just deleted logs
and system events.34, 35 The actual cause of the outage was the manipulation of the ICS itself and the loss of
control due to direct interactive operations by the adversary. The loss of view into the system through the
wiping of the SCADA network systems simply delayed restoration efforts.
In summary, Stage 2 consisted of the following attack elements:




35

Supporting attacks:
o Schedule disconnects for UPS systems
o Telephonic floods against at least one oblenergos’ customer support line
Primary attack: SCADA hijack with malicious operation to open breakers
Amplifying attacks:
o KillDisk wiping of workstations, servers, and an HMI card inside of an RTU
o Firmware attacks against Serial-to-Ethernet devices at substations

Defense Lessons Learned – Passive and Active Defenses
We reviewed the mitigation strategies provided through the DHS ICS-CERT Alert and considered how an
adversary may alter the next attack based on the mitigation taken by a target. We support many of the
mitigation recommendations provided to date. However, it is likely that the adversary will modify attack
approaches in follow-on campaigns and these mitigation strategies may not be sufficient. In the following
section, we discuss mitigations for the attack that took place to extract defense lessons learned. In addition, we
discuss future potential attacker methodologies and provide recommendations that could disrupt similar
adversary’s operations. The mitigations will focus on recommendations for Architecture, Passive Defense, and
Active Defense methodologies along the Sliding Scale of Cyber Security, shown in Figure 9.36

Figure 9: The Sliding Scale of Cyber Security

Spear Phishing
Ukraine Attack
In the attack, the adversary delivered a targeted email with a malicious attachment that appeared to come from
a trusted source to specific individuals within the organizations. Initial mitigation recommendations would point
to end-user awareness training and ongoing phishing testing. Efforts to prevent malware have often
recommended application whitelisting, which can be effective in ICS environments if the ICS vendor approves of
the use. However, based on the details of this attack, application whitelisting would have had a limited role
contained to the execution of initial dropper infections in network segments with infected workstations (e.g.,
users that received and activated infected spear phish emails) where application whitelisting may be more
challenging to implement. It is important to note that application whitelisting would not have deterred or
prevented the second stage ICS attacks that impacted the Ukrainian oblenergos. In at least one instance, the
attacker used a remote rogue client and approved OS-level remote admin features for other components of the
attack.
The Next Attack
The adversary may conduct follow-on attacks that pursue alternative forms of social engineering campaigns, like
targeting the organization through large-scale phishing campaigns, using water-holing attacks, or conducting
direct-call campaigns to users or the help desk. They could also leverage technical exploits not requiring social
engineering of personnel.

Defense Lessons Learned – Passive and Active Defenses

Opportunities to Disrupt
The adversary will likely modify attacks to respond to increases or changes in the target’s defenses. Defenders
need to develop anticipatory responses to attack effects. Since the social engineering components of attacks
targeted email and internet accessible cyber assets, these assets and the networks they reside on are untrusted
contested territory. Communication with these untrusted areas should be segmented, monitored, and
controlled. Operate under the assumption that the environment is accessible by the adversary and ensure
appropriate defenses are in place to protect the operations and control environment from the adversarycontrolled business cyber assets (while some organizations inherently trust their business systems and
networks, additional enforcement and scrutiny of these systems is necessary). Consider using sandboxing
technology to evaluate documents and emails coming into the network, using proxy systems to control
outbound and inbound communication paths, and limiting workstations to communicate only through the proxy
devices by implementing perimeter egress access controls.

Credential Theft
Ukraine Attack
In the attack, the adversary appears to have used BlackEnergy 3 to establish a foothold and utilize keystroke
loggers to perform credential theft. As an initial mitigation approach, we recommend that organizations obtain
the YARA rules for the latest IOCs. By using the YARA forensic tool, organizations can search for BlackEnergy 3
infections and then utilize antimalware removal tools to eliminate the malware from the infected assets.
Defenders should be mindful of the time it takes to detect an infected host as the intruder may have already
moved inside the network and secured additional methods to interact and communicate with the infected
network. Organizations should change user and shared user passwords (ensure that these steps are approved by
operations and the vendor, and tested for impacts to operations and existing security controls).
The Next Attack
Adversaries with persistent access will simply use a different remote access Trojan, an updated version of
BlackEnergy 3, or an alternate mode of credential attacks. To detect and mitigate adversary movement
throughout an environment and account manipulation, mitigation efforts should be focused on directory (e.g.,
Active Directory, Domain, eDirectory, and LDAP) segmentation with organizational unit trust models. This
approach would allow early detection and prevent some basic attacker approaches.
Opportunities to Disrupt
Monitor user account behavior, network and system communication, and directory-level activity with a focus on
identifying abnormalities. Implement alarm capabilities with different priority-level alarms based on the risk of
the systems associated with the alarms. It is important to note that YARA is a forensics tool and is not a
continuous monitoring solution.

Data Exfiltration
Ukraine Attack
After the attackers achieved the necessary freedom of movement and action in the IT infrastructure, they began
exfiltrating the necessary information and discovering the hosts and devices to devise an attack concept to
hijack the SCADA DMS to open breakers and cause a power outage. They followed this with destructive attacks
against workstations, servers, and embedded devices that provide industrial communications in their
distribution substations. The mitigation recommendation here is to understand where this type of information
exists inside your business network and ICSs. Minimizing where the information resides and controlling access is

a priority for an ICS dependent organization.
The Next Attack
Attackers may look deeper into the ICS configuration and settings or controller and protection/safety logic.
Ensure to maintain a vaulted copy of known good project files, control and safety logic, and firmware. Also using
file integrity checkers to monitor access or sample loaded files for changes.
Opportunities to Disrupt
Realize that attackers may be able to develop additional attack approaches as they have learned a system and
may have stolen information that allows for the development of more powerful future attacks. Defenders
should examine their detection and response capabilities. Decision makers should review their restoration plans
for attacks with the potential to go deeper into the ICS and could result in damaged equipment. Identify new
connections leaving the environment and previously unseen encrypted communications. Network Security
Monitoring (NSM) is a great active defense method of detecting exfiltration and ending an adversary’s attack
path before it disrupts the ICS.

VPN Access
Ukraine Attack
Mitigation guidance based on the attacker approach used in this campaign recommends using two-factor
authentication with user tokens to strengthen authentication.
The Next Attack
Attackers may begin looking for existing point-to-point VPN implementations at trusted third party networks or
through remote support employee connections where split tunneling is enabled. The immediate mitigation
recommendation is to implement trusted jump host or intermediary systems with Network Access Control (NAC)
enforcement. Additionally, a VPN configuration approach that disables split tunneling should be enforced.
Opportunities to Disrupt: Defenders are reminded that having remote access through a trusted connection is
advantageous for an attacker. Begin by asking why each trusted communication path exists, evaluate the risk,
and eliminate each path that does not have an identified need that outweighs the risk of having an attack path.
For those communication paths that must remain, consider implementing time of use access for users.
Implement the ability to disconnect these paths in an automated way after a defined period of time after access
in granted, and a method to disconnect manually if needed. From a passive defense perspective, force choke
points in the environment by ensuring that the remote VPNs enter into the environment through a dedicated
remote access DMZ. This ensures that traffic and connections can be monitored by active defenders using
techniques such as network security monitoring to identify abnormalities in duration of connections, number of
connections, and time the connections occur.

Workstation Remote Access
Ukraine Attack
Based on the details provided, the adversaries used the organizations’ workstations remotely (while the attacker
was physically remote, logically they were local to the host) to conduct Stage 2 of the attack. Mitigation
recommendations focus on disabling remote access at the host and at the perimeter firewall.

E-ISAC | Analysis of the Cyber Attack on the Ukrainian Power Grid | March 18, 2016
13

Defense Lessons Learned – Passive and Active Defenses

The Next Attack
Adversaries may modify attack approaches to load additional remote access tools, utilize remote shell
capabilities, and tunnel communications over authorized perimeter firewall communications. In response to this
modified attack approach, mitigation efforts should focus on host based application aware firewalls, application
whitelisting, and configuration management efforts to identify changes in the operation of an asset. Application
whitelisting, if installed on the operator HMI to prevent installation of unauthorized remote access software, will
not aid in the prevention of authorized software. Also, keep in mind that specific control system vendors may
not approve of the whitelisting software.
Opportunities to Disrupt
As a defender prepares for a cyber asset within a trusted environment that may be compromised and remotely
controlled, they must consider approaches to quickly move to a conservative operations environment where the
ability to issue control signals from untrusted assets is paused. Proper architecture would dictate the ability to
segment or disable activities such as remote connections, and unnecessary outbound communications, while
conducting active defense mechanisms; such as incident response prior to restoring operational control
capabilities to known good assets.

Control and Operate
Ukraine Attack
As the attackers utilized the operator HMI’s, they operated numerous sites under the control of the dispatcher.
Mitigation approaches for this specific action would focus on application level logic requiring confirmation from
the operator, or implement Area of Responsibility (AoR) limitations that only allow an operator to effect certain
components of a system. For example: If an entity implemented AoR on one operator workstation that provided
east breaker control, and a second operator workstation that provided West breaker control, then an adversary
positioned on one workstation would be limited to the AoR allowed on that specific workstation. Some vendor
systems allow for Username determined AoR, Workstation determined AoR, and/or an intersection model that
combines username and workstation identifier in AoR authorization. There are variations amongst vendor
systems in how authentication is handled within the local workstation, directory, or at the application.
The Next Attack
When an attacker identifies a workstation with application security controls in place that limits their capabilities,
they may modify their attack to control the system directly by issuing or injecting control commands. Mitigation
strategies for this approach would focus on communication path authentication or protocol authentication that
would require commands to be issued from an authorized asset. Monitoring communication sessions between
hosts can lead to early detection and investigation of suspicious communications.
Opportunities to Disrupt
Preparing for adversarial utilization of cyber assets, or communication paths to control and operate elements of
an ICS system, requires system defenders to develop a response approach that eliminates entire sections of
cyber asset elements and networks in an effort to inhibit automated control and activate manual operations
only. As adversaries learn the environment, they may issue test commands and interact with the SCADA
environment without the intention to disrupt it. For mitigation purposes, defenders must talk to operators and
ask about abnormal occurrences, and from a passive defense perspective, ensure that logs are collected not only
from the host but also from the SCADA applications. Additionally, implement a log aggregation architecture that
replicates log files from assets into a log correlation system. Finally, have active defenders routinely review
these logs in conjunction with other monitoring activity throughout the ICS to identify abnormalities.

Defense Lessons Learned – Passive and Active Defenses

Tools and Technology impacts
Ukraine Attack
The attackers used multiple approaches to impact communication tools, operator technology for restoration
efforts, and facility infrastructure essential to many operator activities. Therefore, mitigation recommendations
are varied. Items to focus on are:


Establishing filtering and response capabilities at telecom providers to activate during an ongoing TDoS
attack



Disable remote management of field devices when they are not required.



Disconnect building control infrastructure systems from the ICS network.



Consider the number of spares required for embedded systems to regain required communication or
control/protection.

The Next Attack
A subsequent attack may progress from resource consumption to a more direct communication path outage
that affects communication capabilities. To mitigate this approach, defenders need to establish alternate
communications infrastructure for essential service capabilities.
After an attacker identifies increased security requirements for field device management, they may attempt to
establish direct access to a field device through a local asset with connectivity or physical presence at the site for
direct firmware manipulation. Mitigation strategies for this attack approach focus on electronic and physical
access controls and the development of a rapid response capability during an attack or incident.
Opportunities to Disrupt
A determined adversary can impact remote assets either electronically or physically. A defender should develop
strong recovery and restoration approaches to replace mission-critical cyber asset components. One option is to
rely on inventory and mutual aid assistance from trusted peer organizations and/or suppliers. In cases where
specific assets are not immediately recoverable, it is necessary to develop the ability to operate the larger
system with operational islands that can be recovered in a timely manner.
Defenders should have access to and visibility of the ICSs to be able to identify abnormal behavior around field
device interaction. For example, uploading firmware outside of a scheduled downtime should be quickly
observable. Firmware modifications over the network cause spikes in network traffic that active defenders
should be consistently looking for. See Figure 10 for an example of a malicious firmware update to an industrial
network switch. Even without knowing the baseline of normal activity, which defenders should have, it can be
trivial to spot firmware updates in network data.

Respond and Restore
Ukraine Attack
The cyber attacks performed against three Ukrainian oblenergos were well planned and highly coordinated. The
attacks consisted of several major elements with both enabling and supporting attack segments. The attackers
were remote and interacted with multiple locations within each of their targets to include central and regional
facilities. Distribution utilities traditionally have both central business and engineering office(s) and a number of
branch facilities used to support line crew, meter reading, bill payment, and distributed supervisory control
operations. Certain types of cyber attacks designed to maliciously take over and operate a SCADA DMS may be
best performed in a distributed fashion at the lowest or most direct level (from a local dispatch and SCADA
server out to the substations that are being monitored and controlled). Preparing for a high-tempo, multifaceted
attack is not easy and it requires careful plan review, testing, integrated defense, and operations exercises.
Rehearsing steps to more quickly sever or prevent remote access, to safely separate the ICSs from connected
networks, or to contain and isolate suspicious hosts is critical.
The Next Attack
The next attack may purposefully differ in its approach to throw off or defeat the defender’s plans and
expectations. It is critical that defenders exercise and train against different scenarios and be aware that
attackers are co-adaptive and creative. It is vital to develop capabilities with flexibility in mind.
Opportunities to Disrupt/Restore
Operations personnel must be involved in planning for restoration from a successful Stage 2 ICS attack. Concepts
to consider from an electric operations and engineering perspective include the following and are graphically
depicted in Figure 11:


Cyber contingency analysis: Continuous analysis and preparing the system for the next event.



Cyber failure planning: Modeling and testing cyber system response to network and asset outages.



Cyber conservative operations: Intentionally eliminating planned and unplanned changes as well as
stopping any potentially impactful processes.

Recommendations
Architecture
Recommendations:


Properly segment networks from each other.



Ensure logging is enabled on devices that support it, including both IT and Operational Technology (OT)
assets.



Ensure that network architecture, such as switches, are managed and have the ability to capture data
from the environment to support Passive and Active Defense mechanisms.



Make backups of critical software installers and include an MD5 and SHA256 digital hash of the
installers.



Collect and vault backup project files from the network.



Test the tools and technologies that passive and active defense mechanisms will need (such as digital
imaging software) on the environment to ensure that it will not negatively impact systems.



Prioritize and patch known vulnerabilities based on the most critical assets in the organization.



Limit remote connections only to personnel that need them. When personnel need remote access,
ensure that if they do not need control that they do not have access to control elements. Use two-form
authentication on the remote connections.



Consider use of a system event monitoring system, configured and monitored specifically for high-value
ICS/SCADA systems.

Passive Defense
Recommendations:


Application whitelisting can help limit adversary initial infection vectors and should be used when not
too invasive to the ICSs.



DMZs and properly tuned firewalls between network segments will give visibility into the environment
and allow defenders the time required to identify intrusions.



Establish a central logging and data aggregation point to allow forensic evidence to be collected and
made available to defenders.



Implement alarm package priorities for abnormal cyber events within the control system.



Enforce a password reset policy in the event of a compromise especially for VPNs and administrative
accounts.



Utilize up-to-date antivirus or endpoint security technologies to allow for the denial of known malware.



Configure an intrusion detection system so that rules can be quickly deployed to search for intruders.

Active Defense
Recommendations:


Train defenders to hunt for odd communications leaving the networked environment such as new IP
communications.
E-ISAC | Analysis of the Cyber Attack on the Ukrainian Power Grid | March 18, 2016
18

Recommendations



Perform network security monitoring to continuously search through the networked environment for
abnormalities.



Plan and train to incident response plans that incorporate both the IT and OT network personnel.



Consider active defense models for security operations such as the active cyber defense cycle.



Ensure that personnel performing analysis have access to technologies such as sandboxes to quickly
analyze incoming phishing emails or odd files and extract indicators of compromise (IOCs) to search for
infected systems.



Use backup and recovery tools to take digital images from a few of the systems in the supervisory
environment such as HMIs and data historian systems every 6-12 months. This will allow a baseline of
activity to be built and make the images available for scanning with new IOCs such as new YARA rules
on emerging threats.



Train defenders on using tools such as YARA to scan digital images and evidence collected from the
environment but do not perform the scans in the production environment itself.

Good architecture and passive defense practices build a defensible ICS; active defense processes establish a
defended ICS environment. Countering flexible and persistent human adversaries requires properly trained and
equipped human defenders.

Implications and Conclusion
Implications for Defenders
The remote cyber attacks directed against Ukraine’s electricity infrastructure were bold and successful. The
cyber operation was highly synchronized and the adversary was willing to maliciously operate a SCADA system
to cause power outages, followed by destructive attacks to disable SCADA and communications to the field. The
destructive element is the first time the world has seen this type of attack against OT systems in a nation’s
critical infrastructure. This is an escalation from past destructive attacks that impacted general-purpose
computers and servers (e.g., Saudi Aramco, RasGas, Sands Casino, and Sony Pictures). Several lines were crossed
in the conduct of these attacks as the targets can be described as solely civilian infrastructure. Historic attacks,
such as Stuxnet, which included destruction of equipment in the OT environment, could be argued as being
surgically targeted against a military target.
Infrastructure defenders must be ready to confront highly targeted and directed attacks that include their own
ICSs being used against them, combined with amplifying attacks to deny communication infrastructure and
future use of their ICSs. The elements analyzed in the attack indicated that there was a specific sequence to the
misuse of the ICSs, including preventing further defender use of the ICSs to restore the system. This means that
the attacker “burned the bridges” behind them by destroying equipment and wiping devices to prevent
automated recovery of the system. The attacks highlight the need to develop active cyber defenses, capable and
well-exercised incident response plans, and resilient operations plans to survive a sophisticated attack and
restore the system.
Nothing about the attack in Ukraine was inherently specific to Ukrainian infrastructure. The impact of a similar
attack may be different in other nations, but the attack methodology, Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures
(TTPs) observed are employable in infrastructures around the world.

Conclusion
We have identified five themes for defenders to focus on as they consider what this attack means for their
organization:
Theme 1
As defenders of ICSs, consider the sequence of events taken by the adversary in the months leading up to
December 23, 2015 when this cyber operation targeting Ukrainian electricity infrastructure was planned and
developed. The operation relied upon intrusions that appear to have come from a broader access campaign
conducted in the spring of 2015. In a prolonged attack campaign, there are likely numerous opportunities to
detect and defend the targeted system. The two-stage ICS cyber kill chain helps note that in an ICS environment,
there is an increased window for the detection and identification of the most concerning attack types.
Theme 2
The cyber attacks were conducted within minutes of each other against three oblenergos, resulting in power
outages affecting approximately 225,000 customers for a few hours. While the total number of customers across
three service territories does not add up to a significant number of customers or load across Ukraine, there may
be significance in target selection or specific loads. One critical element of this particular attack was its
coordinated nature affecting three target entities and the thoroughness of the adversary sequence of events in
achieving their goals. Important opportunities for defenders to disrupt the adversary’s sequence of events were
identified.
Theme 3
The cyber attacks were mislabeled as solely linked to BlackEnergy 3 and KillDisk. BlackEnergy 3 was simply a tool
E-ISAC | Analysis of the Cyber Attack on the Ukrainian Power Grid | March 18, 2016
20

Implications and Conclusion

used in Stage 1 of the attacks and KillDisk was an amplifying tool used in Stage 2 of the attacks. BlackEnergy 3
malware was used to gain initial footholds into a multitude of organizations within Ukraine and not just the
three impacted oblenergos. It is unknown if the adversary had planned to use this access campaign to enable
their operation or if achieving access was the motivation leading to the development of a concept to attack the
power system.
Excessive focus on the specific malware used in this attack places defenders into a mindset in which they are
simply waiting for guidance on the specific attack components so they can eliminate them. This attack could
have been enabled by a variety of approaches to gain access and utilize existing assets within a target
environment. Regardless of the initial attack vector, the ICS tools and environment were ultimately used to
achieve the desired effect, not the BlackEnergy 3 malware.
Theme 4
The attack concept had to be able to work across multiple SCADA DMS implementations and target common
susceptible elements, such as storage overwrites for Windows-based operating system workstations and
servers. The attackers likely developed destructive firmware overwrite techniques after discovering accessible
embedded systems. There was likely a significant amount of unobservable adversarial testing performed prior to
introducing the attack into the environment. Many capabilities were demonstrated throughout this attack, and
they all provide specific lessons learned for defenders to take action on.
Theme 5
Information sharing is key in the identification of a coordinated attack and directing appropriate response
actions. Within the Ukraine, an organization with the ability to enable appropriate information sharing and
provide incident response guidance should be pursued. In the United States and other countries with
established information sharing mechanisms, such as ISACs (Information Sharing and Analysis Centers), the
focus should be on maintaining and improving the information provided by asset owners and operators. This
increased data sharing will enhance situation awareness within the sector, which will in turn lead to earlier
attack detection and facilitate incident response.
In many ways, the Ukrainian oblenergos and their staff, as well as the involved Ukrainian government members
deserve congratulations. This attack was a world first in many ways, and the Ukrainian response was impressive
with all aspects considered.
As the investigation and analysis of technical data continues and more information regarding this attack
surfaces, the authors of this DUC will update this report where appropriate in an effort to maintain the most
accurate and beneficial guidance document possible for ICS defenders. The E-ISAC will continue to provide
credible reporting and guidance as well.

Appendix Information Evaluation
Credibility: 538
The claims by the Ukrainian government that outages in the service territory of the targeted electricity
companies were caused by a series of cyber attacks have been confirmed. The claim was originally met with
private skepticism by the SANS ICS team as ICS organizations frequently have reliability issues and incorrectly
blame cyber mechanisms such as malware found on the network that is unrelated to the outage. Early reporting
on incidents is often rushed and stressful which leads to inaccurate claims. However, in the Ukrainian case, there
is a large amount of evidence available; including malware samples, interviews with operators present during
the incident, and confirmation by multiple private companies involved in the incident. Lastly, the U.S.
government has since also confirmed the attacks due to their own investigation.
The most recent report released from DHS ICS-CERT39 cites direct interviews with “operations and information
technology staff and leadership at six Ukrainian organizations with first-hand experience of the event.” Based on
the information provided in the report,40 the U.S. delegation interviewed and considered information from the
three impacted organizations as well as others. The format of the interviews, and asset owner and operator
discussions, indicated that “the team was not able to independently review technical evidence of the cyberattack. However, a significant number of independent reports from the team’s interviews as well as
documentary findings corroborate the events…”.41 However, a large amount of technical information was made
available to the larger community including indicators of compromise, malware samples, technical information
about the ICS itself and its components, and some samples of logs from the SCADA environment.42 The majority
of sources to date have relied upon initial attempts by Ukrainian power entities to inform customers about the
cause of the outage and sources derived from interviews with impacted entities. The DHS report does not
attempt to assign attacker attribution and neither will this DUC.

Amount of Technical Information Available: 443
A score of 4 has been assigned for the technical information available due to the fact that malware samples,
observable ICS impacts, technical indicators of compromise, and first hand interviews were available. The
investigation also included a joint working group between the Ukrainian government, impacted oblenergos, and
U.S. government representatives starting on January 18, 2016.44 This amount of information was sufficient to
confirm the attacks.
However, it should be noted that there may be pieces of information missing due to the lack of visibility in
various parts of the ICS network. As an example, packet captures from the network during the attack and field

It should be noted that many in the community would like access to internal forensic logs of the impacted oblenergos. This is an
understandable request but it is extremely rare for impacted organizations to make such information publicly available. SANS ICS team
members have been able to view technical data in both public and non-government private channels to confirm the existence of forensic
data and the core components of the analysis based off of the data.

device logging were not available. With this information even more about the technical minutia of the attack
would be available. The amount of information available as well as the willingness by the impacted oblenergos
and Ukrainian government to share that information publicly was the most seen to date for a confirmed
intentional cyber attack that impacted the operations of an ICS.
When considering the technical information provided, the authors of this DUC have considered the larger public
reporting of electricity customer outages within Ukraine as a component of the validation and evidence
necessary to demonstrate the attacker effects to the electricity system. The official public alert by DHS
corroborates prior reporting and is based on interviews and information exchanged with the impacted
organizations.
