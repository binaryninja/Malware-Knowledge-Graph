Adversaries don’t work 9-5 and neither do we. At eSentire, our 24/7 SOCs are staffed with
Elite Threat Hunters and Cyber Analysts who hunt, investigate, contain and respond to
threats within minutes.
We have discovered some of the most dangerous threats and nation state attacks in our
space – including the Kaseya MSP breach and the more_eggs malware.
Our Security Operations Centers are supported with Threat Intelligence, Tactical Threat
Response and Advanced Threat Analytics driven by our Threat Response Unit – the TRU
team.
In TRU Positives, eSentire’s Threat Response Unit (TRU) provides a summary of a recent
threat investigation. We outline how we responded to the confirmed threat and what
recommendations we have going forward.
Here’s the latest from our TRU Team…

What did we find?

1/7

An information stealing malware called Mars Stealer in a customer’s environment
within the consumer services industry.

Summary of the Incident
The victim downloaded and executed a fake Chrome installer (chromesetup.iso) from
>hxxps[:]//googleglstatupdt[.]com/LEND/ChromeSetup.iso.

2/7

The ISO contains chromesetup.exe.
When manually executed by the victim, the fake setup process initializes the
NetSupportManager RAT (remote access tool) and the legitimate Chrome setup
as a decoy (Figure 1).
NetSupportManager is commonly used to remotely control systems for
malicious purposes.
A shortcut is also added to the user’s startup directory for persistence.

Figure 1 Endpoint view of NetSupportManager execution and decoy payload.
Using the NetSupportManager RAT session, the threat actor copied obfuscated
scripts with a .wmd extension that are responsible for creating a renamed AutoIT
binary and an loading an obfuscated version of Mars Stealer from
%TEMP%/IXP<3-digit number> .TMP.
One of the obfuscated scripts contains an embedded payload encrypted with
RC4 using the hardcoded key ‘344868553478223918282826525’ (Figure 2).

routine.

Once loaded, Mars Stealer performs several HTTP requests to retrieve
configuration and DLL (Dynamic Link Library) files required for Mars Stealer to
operate successfully and upload stolen data (Figure 3).

Background on Mars Stealer
In June 2021, Mars Stealer was advertised on XSS, the Russian-language criminal
forum, by MarsTeam for $140/month or $800 for a lifetime subscription.
Mars Stealer’s capabilities include:
Cryptocurrency theft (“Our software was developed taking into account the
wishes of people working in crypto, so at Mars you can find everything you need
to work with crypto and more.” – MarsTeam post on XSS forum).
The stealer supports dozens of popular browser plugins for popular
cryptocurrency platforms, such as Coinbase.
Additionally, in December 2021, MarsTeam announced the release of “Mars
ClipboardChanger”, which substitutes crypto wallet addresses in the victim’s
clipboard cache to hijack payments.
Data theft from major web browsers, including two-factor authentication (2FA)
Chrome-based browser extensions (“Collects passwords, cookies, cc,
autocomplete, browsing history, file download history.” - MarsTeam post on XSS
forum).
Profiling or fingerprinting the infected system.
Exfiltrating files from the infected system.

How did we find it?
MDR for Endpoint identified the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated
with NetSupportManager RAT and AutoIT malware deployment.

What did we do?
Our team of 24/7 SOC Cyber Analysts alerted the customer of the activity.

What can you learn from this TRU positive?
Drive-by attacks involving malware masquerading as legitimate software are becoming
increasingly common since they require no exploits and rely on a victim running code
on the attacker’s behalf.
Mars Stealer has seen continued development since its release, and targets a wide
array of credentials, particularly those used for cryptocurrency exchanges.
Identifying information stealing malware as early as possible is critical to minimize
losses from fraud and hijacked accounts.

Recommendations from our Threat Response Unit (TRU) Team:
While rapid identification and containment of successful exploits is necessary to limit impact,
unsuccessful attempts still present an opportunity to shore up defenses. The best approach
to preventing drive-by attacks is by using a layered defense, such as:

5/7

Ensure antivirus signatures are up-to-date.
Use a Next-Gen AV (NGAV) or Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) product to
detect and contain threats.
Audit your environment and endpoints regularly to ensure endpoints are patched with
the latest vendor security updates.
Increase awareness of social engineering threat tactics with your users through
phishing and security awareness training.
Ensure users are aware of risks associated with downloading applications from
the web.
Always ensure software is downloaded from a legitimate source.

Ask Yourself
Do you have the capability to rapidly identify and contain malicious code
executed unwittingly by users in your environment?
Are you monitoring your endpoints 24/7 and what degree of control do you have
to initiate a kill switch when required?
What level of managed endpoint support do you have in place?
