Dissecting 'Operation Ababil' - an OSINT Analysis
ddanchev.blogspot.com.es/2012/09/dissecting-operation-ababil-osint.html

Provoked by a questionable online video posted on YouTube, Muslims from the around the
world united in an apparent opt-in botnet crowdsourcing campaign aiming to launch a
DDoS (denial of service attack) against YouTube for keeping the video online, and against
several major U.S banks and financial institutions.
Dubbed "Operation Ababil", and operated by the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam a.k.a Qassam Cyber
Fighters , the campaign appear to have had a limited, but highly visible impact on the
targeted web sites. Just like in every other crowdsourced opt-in botnet campaign such as the
"Coordinated Russia vs Georgia cyber attack in progress", the "Iranian opposition
launches organized cyber attack against pro-Ahmadinejad sites", the "Electronic Jihad
v3.0 - What Cyber Jihad Isn't" campaign, and the "The DDoS Attack Against CNN.com"
campaign, political sentiments over the attribution element seem to have orbited around the
notion that it was nation-sponsored by the Iranian government.
What's so special about this attack? Did the individuals behind it poses sophisticated hacking
or coding abilities? Was the work of hacktivists crowdsourcing bandwidth, or was it actually
sponsored by the Iranian government? Can we even talk about attack attribution given that
the group claiming responsibility for the attacks doesn't have a strong digital fingerprint?
In this post, I'll perform an OSINT (open source intelligence) analysis aiming to expose one
of the individuals part of the group that organized the campaign, spread their propaganda
message to as many Muslim Facebook groups as possible, and actually claim responsibility
1/9

for the attacks once they took place.
The campaign originally began with a message left on Pastebin.com by the Qassam Cyber
Fighters group announcing "Operation Ababil":

The original message left is as follows:
"Operation Ababil, The second weekIn the previous announcements we stated that we will
not tolerate insulting exalted character of the prophet of mercy and kindness. Due to the
insult, we planned and accomplished a series of cyber operations against the insulting
country's credit and financial centers.Some U.S. officials tried to divert people's attention
from the subject and claimed that the main aim of the operation was not deal to insults but it
had other intentions.
The officials claimed that certain countries have taken these measures to solve their internal
problems.We strongly reject the American officials' insidious attempts to deceive public
opinion. We declare that the kindness and love of Muslims and free-minded people of the
world to the great prophet of Islam is much more than their violent anger be deflected and
controlled by such deceptive tricks.Insult to a prophet is not acceptable especially when it is
the Last prophet Muhammad (Peace Be upon Him).
So as we promised before, the attack will be continued until the removal of that sacrilegious
movie from the Internet.Therefore, we suggest a Timetable for this week attacks. Knowing
which times the banks and other targets are out of service, the customers of targeted sites
also can manage to do their jobs as well and have a rest while the specific organization is
under attack.We shall attack for 8 hours daily, starting at 2:30 PM GMT, every day.
We repeat again the attacks will continue for sure till the removal of that sacrilegious
movie.We invite all cyberspace workers to join us in this Proper Act. If America's arrogant
government do not submit, the attack will be large and larger and will include other evil
countries like Israel, French and U.Kingdom indeed.Tuesday 9/25/2012 : attack to Wells
Fargo site, www.wellsfargo.comWednesday 9/26/2012 : attack to U.S. Bank site,
www.usbank.comThursday 9/27/2012 : attack to PNC site, www.pnc.com Weekends:
planning for the next week' attacks.Mrt. Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters"

Periodically, the group also released update notes for the campaigns currently taking
place:

The original message published is as follows:
"Operation Ababil" started over BoA :http://pastebin.com/mCHia4W5
http://pastebin.com/wMma9zyGIn the second step we attacked the largest bank of the united
states, the "chase" bank. These series of attacks will continue untill the Erasing of that nasty
movie from the Internet.The site "www.chase.com" is down and also Online banking at
"chaseonline.chase.com" is being decided to be Offline !Down with modern infidels.###
Cyber fighters of Izz ad-din Al qassam ###"
Second statement released by the group:

The original message published is as follows:
"Dear Muslim youths, Muslims Nations and are noblemenWhen Arab nations rose against
their corrupt regimes (those who support Zionist regime) at the other hand when, Crucify
infidels are terrified and they are no more supporting human rights. United States of America
with the help of Zionist Regime made a Sacrilegious movie insulting all the religions not only
Islam.All the Muslims worldwide must unify and Stand against the action, Muslims must do
whatever is necessary to stop spreading this movie.
We will attack them for this insult with all we have.All the Muslim youths who are active in the
Cyber world will attack to American and Zionist Web bases as much as needed such that
they say that they are sorry about that insult.We, Cyber fighters of Izz ad-din Al qassam will
attack the Bank of America and New York Stock Exchange for the first step. These Targets

3/9

are properties of American-Zionist Capitalists. This attack will be started today at 2 pm. GMT.
This attack will continue till the Erasing of that nasty movie. Beware this attack can vary in
type. Down with modern infidels."
Clearly, the group behind the campaigns aimed to deliver concise propaganda to prospective
Internet connected users who would later on be instructed on how to participate in the DDoS
attacks. Let's assess the potential of the distributed DDoS tool that was used in the
campaign.
Sample screenshot of the DDoS script in Arabic:

Inside the .html file, we can see that there are only three web addresses that will be targeted
in their campaign:

Detection rate for the DDoS script:
youtube.html - MD5: c3fd7601b4aefe70e4a8f6d73bf5c997
Detected by 6 out of 43 antivirus scanners as HTool-Loic; Hacktool.Generic;
TROJ_GEN.F47V0924
Originally, the attack relied on a static recruitment message which included links to the DIY
DDoS script located on 4shared.com and Mediafire.com. What's particularly interesting is
the fact that the files were uploaded by a user going under the handle of "Marzi Mahdavi II".
It's important to point out that these static links were distributed as part of the recruitment
campaign across multiple Muslim-friendly Facebook groups.
Thanks to this fact, we could easily identify the user's Facebook account, and actually spot
the original message seeking participation in the upcoming attacks.

Marzi Mahdavi II has once referenced a link pointing to the same blog, clearly indicating that
he's following the ongoing recruitment campaigns across multiple Web sites:
Second blog post enticing users to participate in the DDoS campaign:

This very latest example of Iran's hacktivist community understanding of the cyber
operations, once again lead me to the conclusion that what we've got here is either the fact
that Iran's hacktivist community is lacking behind with years compared to sophisticated
Eastern European hacking teams and cybercrime-friendly communities, or that Iran is on
purposely demonstrating low cyber operation capabilities in an attempt to trick the Western
world into thinking that it's still in a "catch up mode" with the rest of the world when it comes
to offensive cyber operations.
Did these coordinated DDoS campaigns actually had any impact on the targered web sites?
According to data from the Host-Tracker, they seem to have achieved limited, but visible
results, a rather surprising fact given the low profile DDoS script released by the
campaigners.
Sample Host-Tracker report for a targeted web site during the campaign:

8/9

Is the Iranian government really behind this campaign, or was it actually the work of
amateurs with outdated and virtually irrelevant technical skills? Taking into consideration the
previous DDoS campaign launched by Iranian hacktivists in 2009, in this very latest one
we once again see a rather limited understanding of cyber operations taking into
consideration the centralized nature of the chain of command in this group.
What's also worth pointing out is the fact that this is the first public appearance of the group
that claims responsibility for these attacks. Considering this and the lack of a strong digital
fingerprint for the group in question, virtually anyone on the Internet can engineer cyber
warfare tensions between Iran and the U.S, by basically impersonating a what's believed
to be an Iranian group.
