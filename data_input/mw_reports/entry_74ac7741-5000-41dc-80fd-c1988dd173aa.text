The Patchwork APT group, also known as Dropping Elephant, Chinastrats,
Monsoon, Sarit, Quilted Tiger, APT-C-09, and ZINC EMERSON, was first
discovered in December 2015. This cyber espionage group targets multiple highprofile Diplomats and economists having foreign relations with China, using a
custom set of attack tools. The attacks were generally made through spear
phishing campaign or watering hole attacks. This group is suspected to be
run by an Indian-speaking threat actor targeting foreign embassies and
diplomatic offices in Pakistan, Sri-Lanka, Uruguay, Bangladesh, Taiwan,
Australia, and the USA. At the beginning
of 2018, researchers discovered that the Patchwork APT group was also
operating spear phishing campaigns targeting think tank groups from the US.
Recently, in January 2021, the research team
at Cyble observed the Patchwork APT cyber espionage group targeting China
with a malformed document
named “Chinese_Pakistani_fighter_planes_play_war_games.docx”. We suspect

that the attack is executed in the form of spear phishing emails with
malicious attachments. We discovered that the attack used techniques such as
exploitation of long-closed vulnerabilities and social engineering campaigns.
The image below showcases Chinese and Pakistani fighter war games with a CVE2019-0808 exploit code that drops and executes Patchwork APT payloads on
victim machines.

Technical Analysis:
Our analysis is based on a sample that was found in the
wild on January 18, 2021 with SHA- 256

sample is a malcrafted Microsoft document with an EPS
script that exploits the CVE-2019-0808 vulnerability.
CVE-2019-0808 is a privilege elevation vulnerability in the Windows Win32k
component due to the NULL pointer dereference, which leads to an arbitrary code
execution as a SYSTEM user. It allows the attacker to install and run additional
payloads on the victim machine with full user rights. This APT group
implants an extracted EPS script dropped and executed by the malicious
document. The following image shows the content of the EPS file with the icon.

The malcrafted EPS scripts drops a Patchwork payload file named
“MSBuild.exe” with SHA256446e00a53014006804135ef1c31dac6837c0cf635c26426e396b3067764f956d in the path
of the infected host as highlighted below. This is a VC+ compiled file with
encrypted data, which decrypts and loads the Windows API function dynamically
during runtime.
File Path- %Users%\%AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start
Menu\Programs\Startup folder
Interestingly, the payload file has a hardcoded command and control (C2) server
IP, URL and User agent as shown in the image below.

Upon execution, this file creates a Mutex named
“asssszxxzcccjdddddccccdjjjddssdfgredf ” to mark its presence on the victim
machine and avoid multiple executions of itself as shown in the process explorer
image below.

The malware payload starts collecting information from the victim
system such as computer name, comspec, home directory, logon
server, the number of processors, and much more using Windows API such
as GetComputerNameA, GetTempPath, and GetConsoleWindow.
The image below shows the system information collected during our analysis.

The following image shows the stack data, which includes collected system
information such as a universally unique identifier (UUID), username
(#un), computer name (#cn), IP address (#lan), number of processor (#nop) and
version (#ver) along with the C2 IP.

The Patchwork payload logs keystrokes, screenshots, and running processes with
date and time and stores them in a file named TPX498.dat, in a %Temp% folders.
The image below depicts the contents of the keylogger data file. The payload file
also drops an 9PT568.dat file with ID:e29ac6c0-7037-11de-816d806e6f6e69638e6d which might be used for network data encryption.

Then malware uses the custom encryption logic to encode data and
send it to the C2 server over HTTP communication, as depicted in the Wireshark
image below. The multiple process threads of MSBuild.exe are responsible for
sharing encoded stolen data in a POST request to the server. Each request body
of the POST request ends with a unique identification value &crc=e3a6.

The Patchwork APT campaign has autostart capabilities by adding the payload
files in a %Startup folder% of the victim machine so that it can execute on every
reboot of the system.
The APT group employs the following registry entry for its persistence on
the victim machine.
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File
Execution Options\filename.exe
Our recommendations are:
Refrain from clicking on unverified/unidentified links.
Do not open untrusted email attachments.
Patch all open vulnerabilities or follow rigid patch management.
Keep your Security software updated.
The Patchwork APT group has expanded its wings with enhanced malware
toolsets and has been targeting China and other regions through spear phishing
attacks. In recent attacks, the Patchwork group has
been using a payload that is a modified or custom-built RAT instead of using
readily available remote admin tools.
