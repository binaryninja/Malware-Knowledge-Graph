An indictment was unsealed in New York today charging two Iranian nationals for their
involvement in a cyber-enabled campaign to intimidate and influence American voters, and
otherwise undermine voter confidence and sow discord, in connection with the 2020 U.S.
presidential election.
According to court documents, Seyyed Mohammad Hosein Musa Kazemi (‫ﺳﯿﺪ ﻣﺤﻤﺪ ﺣﺴﯿﻦ ﻣﻮﺳﯽ‬
‫)ﮐﺎﻇﻤﯽ‬, aka Mohammad Hosein Musa Kazem, aka Hosein Zamani, 24, and Sajjad Kashian
(‫)ﺳﺠﺎد ﮐﺎﺷﯿﺎن‬, aka Kiarash Nabavi, 27, both of Iran, obtained confidential U.S. voter information
from at least one state election website; sent threatening email messages to intimidate and
interfere with voters; created and disseminated a video containing disinformation about
purported election infrastructure vulnerabilities; attempted to access, without authorization,
several states’ voting-related websites; and successfully gained unauthorized access to a
U.S. media company’s computer network that, if not for successful FBI and victim company
efforts to mitigate, would have provided the conspirators another vehicle to disseminate false
claims after the election.

“This indictment details how two Iran-based actors waged a targeted, coordinated campaign
to erode confidence in the integrity of the U.S. electoral system and to sow discord among
Americans,” said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department’s
National Security Division. “The allegations illustrate how foreign disinformation campaigns
operate and seek to influence the American public. The Department is committed to
exposing and disrupting malign foreign influence efforts using all available tools, including
criminal charges.”
“As alleged, Kazemi and Kashian were part of a coordinated conspiracy in which Iranian
hackers sought to undermine faith and confidence in the U.S. presidential election,” said U.S.
Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York. “Working with others,
Kazemi and Kashian accessed voter information from at least one state’s voter database,
threatened U.S. voters via email, and even disseminated a fictitious video that purported to
depict actors fabricating overseas ballots. The United States will never tolerate any foreign
actors’ attempts to undermine our free and democratic elections. As a result of the charges
unsealed today, and the concurrent efforts of our U.S. government partners, Kazemi and
Kashian will forever look over their shoulders as we strive to bring them to justice.”
“The FBI remains committed to countering malicious cyber activity targeting our democratic
process,” said Assistant Director Bryan Vorndran of the FBI’s Cyber Division. “Working
rapidly with our private sector and U.S. government partners and ahead of the election, we
were able to disrupt and mitigate this malicious activity – and then to enable today’s joint,
sequenced operations against the adversary. Today’s announcement shows what we can
accomplish as a community and a country when we work together, and the FBI will continue
to do its part to keep our democracy safe.”
According to the allegations contained in the indictment unsealed today:
The Voter Intimidation and Influence Campaign
Starting in approximately August 2020, and proceeding until November 2020, Kazemi,
Kashian, and other co-conspirators began a coordinated, campaign to undermine faith and
confidence in the 2020 presidential election (the “Voter Intimidation and Influence
Campaign”) and otherwise sow discord within U.S. society. The Campaign had four
components:
In September and October 2020, members of the conspiracy conducted
reconnaissance on, and attempted to compromise, approximately 11 state voter
websites, including state voter registration websites and state voter information
websites. Those efforts resulted in the successful exploitation of a misconfigured
computer system of a particular U.S. state (“State-1”), and the resulting unauthorized
downloading of information concerning more than 100,000 of State-1’s voters.

In October 2020, members of the conspiracy, claiming to be a “group of Proud Boys
volunteers,” sent Facebook messages and emails (the “False Election Messages”) to
Republican Senators, Republican members of Congress, individuals associated with
the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump, White House advisors, and members of
the media. The False Election Messages claimed that the Democratic Party was
planning to exploit “serious security vulnerabilities” in state voter registration websites
to “edit mail-in ballots or even register non-existent voters.” The False Election
Messages were accompanied by a video (the “False Election Video”) carrying the
Proud Boys logo, which purported, via simulated intrusions and the use of State-1 voter
data, to depict an individual hacking into state voter websites and using stolen voter
information to create fraudulent absentee ballots through the Federal Voting Assistance
[1]
Program (FVAP) for military and overseas voters.
Also in October 2020, the conspirators engaged in an online voter intimidation
campaign involving the dissemination of a threatening message (the “Voter Threat
Emails”), purporting to be from the Proud Boys, to tens of thousands of registered
voters, including some voters whose information the conspiracy had obtained from
State-1’s website. The emails were sent to registered Democrats and threatened the
recipients with physical injury if they did not change their party affiliation and vote for
President Trump.
On Nov. 4, 2020, the day after the 2020 U.S. presidential election, the conspirators
sought to leverage earlier September and October 2020 intrusions into an American
media company’s (Media Company-1) computer networks. Specifically, on that day, the
conspirators attempted to use stolen credentials to again access Media Company-1’s
network, which would have provided them another vehicle for further disseminating
false claims concerning the election through conspirator-modified or created content.
However, because of an earlier FBI victim notification, Media Company-1 had by that
time mitigated the conspirators’ unauthorized access and these log-in attempts failed.
Background on Kazemi and Kashian
Kazemi and Kashian are experienced Iran-based computer hackers who worked as
contractors for an Iran-based company formerly known as Eeleyanet Gostar, and now known
as Emennet Pasargad. Eeleyanet Gostar purported to provide cybersecurity services within
Iran. Among other things, Eeleyanet Gostar is known to have provided services to the Iranian
government, including to the Guardian Council.
As part of his role in the Voter Intimidation and Influence Campaign, Kazemi compromised
computer servers that were used to send the Voter Threat Emails, drafted those emails, and
compromised the systems of Media Company-1. Kashian managed the conspirators’
computer infrastructure used to carry out the Voter Threat Emails campaign and he
purchased social media accounts in furtherance of the Voter Intimidation and Influence
Campaign.

Kazemi and Kashian are both charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer
fraud and abuse, intimidate voters, and transmit interstate threats, which carries a maximum
sentence of five years in prison; one count of voter intimidation, which carries a maximum
sentence of one year in prison; and one count of transmission of interstate threats, which
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. Kazemi is additionally charged with one
count of unauthorized computer intrusion, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in
prison; and one count of computer fraud, namely, knowingly damaging a protected computer,
which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. A federal district court judge will
determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory
factors.
Concurrent with the unsealing of the indictment, the Department of the Treasury Office of
Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated Emennet Pasargad, Kazemi, Kashian, and four
other Iranian nationals comprising Emennet Pasargad leadership pursuant to Executive
Order 13848, “Imposing Certain Sanctions in the Event of Foreign Interference in a United
States Election.” Additionally, the Department of State’s Rewards for Justice Program, is
offering a reward of up to $10 million for information on or about the Kazemi and Kashian’s
activities.
The FBI’s Cyber Division and Cleveland Field Office are investigating the case.
Assistant U.S. Attorneys Dina McLeod and Louis A. Pellegrino and Trial Attorney Adam
Small of the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are
prosecuting the case.
An indictment is merely an allegation, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.
[1] In actuality, the computer intrusions depicted in the False Election Video were simulated
intrusions created by members of the conspiracy using their own server and data obtained
during the State-1 exploitation. Further, the FVAP could not actually be leveraged in the
manner implied by the False Election Video.
