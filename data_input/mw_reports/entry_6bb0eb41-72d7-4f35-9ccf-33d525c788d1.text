New Trojan from the Russian Underground
While major players like Zeus, Gozi, Citadel and other advanced financial malware dominate
the malware threat landscape, newcomers and challengers always try to get a share of the
cyber crime market. One such new malware that was recently made available for purchase
in a Russian underground forum is the Kronos malware. With a $7,000 price tag, this
malware offers multiple modules for evading detection and analysis as well as an option to
test the malware for a week prior to buying it.
Note that the following descriptions of Kronos are based solely on entries in the underground
forum; Trusteer, an IBM company, has not yet analyzed a malware sample in order to
validate the seller’s claims.

Kronos Malware: Like Father, Like Son?
We recently found a cyber criminal offering the Kronos malware to members of a major
Russian underground forum. The forum post details several of the malware’s technical
capabilities and concludes with information on business and purchase options. From the
malware’s description, several elements are worth noting:
Common credential-stealing techniques such as form grabbing and HTML injection
compatible with the major browsers (Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome);
32- and 64-bit ring3 (user-mode) rootkit capable of also “defending from other Trojans”;
Antivirus bypassing;
Malware-to-C&C communication encryption;
Sandbox bypassing.
Consistent with other financial malware developments, it seems that significant time and
effort were given to evading security tools used both by end users and security white hats. In
addition, the HTML injection mechanism is compatible with Zeus. Because Zeus is the most
widely deployed malware, and it is likely that potential clients have used or still use Zeus
variants, the authors of Kronos made sure that the HTML injection files used by Zeus
operators can be easily implemented with Kronos. Coincidence or not, it is also worth noting
that in Greek mythology, Kronos is Zeus’ father.
The business side of this offer is interesting as well. Most malware today is sold in the low
hundreds of dollars, sometimes even offered for free due to several malware source code
leaks. Comparatively, the Kronos malware carries a hefty cost of $7,000. This price,
however, is not the first time a new malware seller has demanded a premium. Approximately
four years ago, Carberp was released and priced at $10,000 (and $15,000 for the addition of

the VNC module, which is almost a standard capability of today’s financial malware). The
Kronos seller also offers a one-week testing server for $1,000, during which time a potential
client will have access to the malware’s control panel and all the bot’s capabilities.
The authors promise to develop new modules for the malware (which will be charged
separately), along with updates and bug fixes (free of charge). The preferred payment
methods for this deal are various forms of e-currency such as Perfect Money and Bitcoin. As
an incentive, early buyers are promised a discounted price.
It remains to be seen how popular Kronos will be within the cybercrime community.
Trusteer’s security team continues to monitor underground forums for new threats as well as
analyze, reverse engineer and study new malware files.
