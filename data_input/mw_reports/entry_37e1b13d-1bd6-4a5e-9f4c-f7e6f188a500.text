A new Android Trojan codenamed FlyTrap has hit at least 140 countries since March 2021
and has spread to over 10,000 victims through social media hijacking, third-party app
stores, and sideloaded applications.
Zimperium’s zLabs mobile threat research teams recently found several previously
undetected applications using Zimperium’s z9 malware engine and on-device detection.
Following their forensic investigation, the zLabs team determined this previously undetected
malware is part of a family of Trojans that employ social engineering tricks to compromise
Facebook accounts.
Forensic evidence of this active Android Trojan attack, which we have named FlyTrap,
points to malicious parties out of Vietnam running this session hijacking campaign since
March 2021. These malicious applications were initially distributed through both Google
Play and third-party application stores. Zimperium zLabs reported the findings to Google,
who verified the provided research and removed the malicious applications from the Google

Play store. However, the malicious applications are still available on third-party, unsecured
app repositories, highlighting the risk of sideloaded applications to mobile endpoints and
user data.
Disclosure: As a key member of the Google App Defense Alliance, Zimperium scans
applications prior to publishing, as well as providing ongoing analysis of Android apps in the
Google Play Store.
In this threat blog, we will:
Cover the capabilities of the FlyTrap Trojan;
Discuss the techniques used to collect and store data;
Demonstrate the communication with the C&C server to exfiltrate stolen data; and
Explore the victimology and impact.

What Can FlyTrap Trojan Do?
The mobile application poses a threat to the victim’s social identity by hijacking their
Facebook accounts via a Trojan infecting their Android device. The information collected
from the victim’s Android device includes:
Facebook ID
Location
Email address
IP address
Cookie and Tokens associated with the Facebook account
These hijacked Facebook sessions can be used to spread the malware by abusing the
victim’s social credibility through personal messaging with links to the Trojan, as well as
propagating propaganda or disinformation campaigns using the victim’s geolocation details.
These social engineering techniques are highly effective in the digitally connected world
and are used often by cybercriminals to spread malware from one victim to another.

How Does FlyTrap Trojan Work?
The threat actors made use of several themes that users would find appealing such as free
Netflix coupon codes, Google AdWords coupon codes, and voting for the best football
(soccer) team or player. Initially available in Google Play and third-party stores, the
application tricked users into downloading and trusting the application with high-quality
designs and social engineering. After installation, the malicious application displays pages
that engage the user and asks for a response from them, such as the ones shown below.

Trojans.
The engagement continues until the user is shown the Facebook login page and asks to log
in to their account to cast their vote or collect the coupon code or credits. All this is just
another trick to mislead the user since no actual voting or coupon code gets generated.
Instead, the final screen tries to justify the fake coupon code by displaying a message
stating that “Coupon expired after redemption and before spending.” The following images
show one of the applications’ UI navigation.

page
Contrary to popular belief that a phishing page is always at the forefront for compromising
or hijacking an account, there are ways to hijack sessions even by logging into the original
and legit domain. This Trojan exploits one such technique known as JavaScript injection.
Using this technique, the application opens the legit URL inside a WebView configured with
the ability to inject JavaScript code and extracts all the necessary information such as
cookies, user account details, location, and IP address by injecting malicious JS code.

server
The manipulation of web resources is addressed as cross-principal manipulation (XPM) in
the research “An Empirical Study Of Web Resource Manipulation In Real-world Mobile
Applications.” Successful login into Facebook by the victim initiates the data exfiltration
process and can be seen in the below screenshots of the communication with the C&C
server.

Several of the Trojans have the same malicious script and therefore identifies the source of
data by the parameter “from_app” as seen in the screenshots below.

The Command & Control server makes use of login credentials for authorizing access to the
harvested data. Security vulnerabilities in the C&C server expose the entire database of
stolen session cookies to anyone on the internet, further increasing the threat to the victim’s
social credibility.

The Victims of FlyTrap Trojan
The exposed database contains the geolocation information of several thousands of victims
based on which, the victimology map shown below was generated. The Zimperium zLabs
mobile threat research team found over 10,000 victims across 144 countries to date, which
illustrates the impact of the social engineering campaign.

Zimperium vs. FlyTrap Trojan
Zimperium zIPS customers are protected against FlyTrap Trojan with our on-device z9
Mobile Threat Defense machine learning engine.
To ensure your Android users are protected from FlyTrap Trojan malware, we recommend a
quick risk assessment. Any application with FlyTrap will be flagged as a Suspicious App
Threat inside zConsole. Admins can also review which apps are sideloaded onto the device
that could be increasing the attack surface and leaving data and users at risk.

Summary of FlyTrap
Malicious threat actors are leveraging common user misconceptions that logging into the
right domain is always secure irrespective of the application used to log in. The targeted
domains are popular social media platforms and this campaign has been exceptionally
effective in harvesting social media session data of users from 144 countries. These
accounts can be used as a botnet for different purposes: from boosting the popularity of
pages/sites/products to spreading misinformation or political propaganda.
Just like any user manipulation, the high-quality graphics and official-looking login screens
are common tactics to have users take action that could reveal sensitive information. In this
case, while the user is logging into their official account, the FlyTrap Trojan is hijacking the
session information for malicious intent.
FlyTrap is just one example of the ongoing, active threats against mobile devices aimed at
stealing credentials. Mobile endpoints are often treasure troves of unprotected login
information to social media accounts, banking applications, enterprise tools, and more. The
tools and techniques used by FlyTrap are not novel but are effective due to the lack of
advanced mobile endpoint security on these devices. It would not take much for a malicious
party to take FlyTrap or any other Trojan and modify it to target even more critical
information.
