Why On-Device Detection Matters: New Ramsay Trojan
Targets Air-Gapped Networks

May 20, 2020

The Ramsay “framework” emerged in late 2019 and was disclosed thanks to a discovery by
researchers querying the VirusTotal public malware repository. As of April 2020, there
appears to be two fully maintained branches of the toolkit. Although in-the-wild instances of
the Ramsay malware appear to be low at present, this may be due to the malware’s highlyspecialized objectives. The Ramsay samples discovered to date are heavily focused on both
persistence and data exfiltration from air-gapped environments. This suggests the possibility
that the malware was developed for advanced targeted campaigns by a threat actor primarily
interested in organizations trying to protect the most-sensitive of information. As is often the
case with specialized malware, there is also a real danger of it “leaking” or being repurposed
to targets that were not in the original threat actors’ sights.

Ramsay Distribution and Persistence
The original version of Ramsay was distributed via maliciously-crafted Office documents.
These documents were distributed via email and were designed to exploit CVE-2017-0199 to
facilitate the installation of the malware. CVE-2017-0199 is a remote code execution flaw in
Microsoft Word. Specifically, it allows attackers to retrieve and launch code, including VBS &
PowerShell, upon launching of a specially-crafted RTF document. Several versions of these
malicious Word documents were discovered on VirusTotal with names such as
“access_test.docx” and “Test.docx”, indicating that the threat actors may have been
evaluating how well their malware fared against vendors’ static engines.
Later versions of Ramsay (v2.a/2.b) were distributed as trojanized installers for well-known
applications such as 7zip. These later versions also included an aggressive spreading
mechanism that locates local and network adjacent PE files and infect them to allow for
further spreading in targeted environments.
Version 2.b was also seen to be exploiting CVE-2017-11882. This vulnerability allows
attackers to achieve arbitrary code execution as the current user in a MS Office 2016 and
several earlier Office Service Pack versions. Both CVE-2017-0199 and CVE-20170-11882
are used for exploitation of client execution (MITRE T1203) purposes.
Along with the spreading capabilities, Ramsay includes multiple techniques for maintaining
persistence. These include:
AppInitDLL Registry Key Entries
Scheduled Tasks
DLL Hijacking

While early versions used well-known persistence techniques such as loading custom DLLs
into other application processes’ address space and task scheduling, later versions leverage
DLL Hijacking, specifically targeting msfte.dll and oci.dll dependencies of the Microsoft
Search Service and the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator service, respectively.

Ramsay Observed Behavior
Ramsay’s main goal is data collection and exfiltration. Immediately upon infection, the trojan
will begin to locate specific document types, particularly MS Word and PDF format files, and
store them in a customized location. The items are also archived and encrypted via RC4,
and subsequently compressed with an instance of WinRar installed by the trojan. It should
be noted that Ramsay will attempt to collect documents from both local and remote locations
where possible. Ramsay also has some built-in “intelligence” to avoid the collection of
duplicate/redundant files.
The analysis is ongoing with respect to the data exfiltration mechanism. Current intelligence
indicates that an additional component will locate the collected “containers” of documents
from infected hosts, identified by special file makers, When the containers are located, AND
a Ramsay control file is located on the affected network, data exfiltration can occur via this
additional component. Ramsay uses intra-network control files to operate, as opposed to a
central command-and-control infrastructure.
Spreading is handled via an additional component, dropped by the main installer. This
component will scan and locate accessible drives/locations (excluding A: and B: reserved
devices).
Given some level of code reuse, there may be correlation between Ramsay and the Retro
Backdoor associated with Darkhotel. As with the data exfiltration piece, analysis of this
relationship is ongoing.

Does SentinelOne Protect Against Ramsay Malware?
Yes, it does. Organizations secured by the SentinelOne platform are fully protected against
the threat from Ramsay malware, as demonstrated in this video.
Even when the network is disconnected such as with an air-gapped device, the SentinelOne
agent will detect the malware locally on-device.

Conclusion
The Ramsay framework is a novel malware toolkit that appears to be under active
development by a sophisticated threat actor. While current telemetry suggests this is a
highly-targeted attack focused on specific environments, history suggests that a malware
toolkit of this nature could soon ‘spread its wings’ and represent a threat to a much wider
audience. Moreover, the discovery of this new toolkit targetting air-gapped machines
highlights the importance of having a behavioral, AI-driven security solution that can actively
detect and respond to threats on the local device without solely relying on cloud-connectivity,
human analysts or static reputation engines.
