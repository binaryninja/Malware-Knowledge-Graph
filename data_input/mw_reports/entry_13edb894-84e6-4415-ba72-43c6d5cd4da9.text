EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA (EMEA)
Conficker remains top threat in Easter Europe, on rise in UK and Italy. For the month of
July, Slovakia and the Czech Republic remain among regional exceptions where
Win32/TrojanDownloader.Bredolab.AA is the most widespread threat, with a share of 5.89%
and 6.48%, respectively. This kind of malware has the capability to copy itself into the
system files and executing itself with every boot-up. At the same time, it establishes
communication with a remote server via HTTP protocol. In other words, when this trojan
horse is in the PC system, its only mission is downloading additional malware – especially
adware, spyware or other threats out from different servers and places on the internet.
Also afflicting other European countries, Win32/TrojanDownloader.Bredolab.AA ranks lower
to Win32/Conficker that remains top threat in Ukraine (32.55%); Russia (23.02%); Bulgaria
and Lithuania (15.43%); Romania (15.4%); South Africa (12.22%); Italy (10.4%); Great
Britain (7.97%); Austria (5.31%), and Germany (4.46%).
For the month of July, Poland and France were dominated by a mixture of Trojans of the
Win32/PSW.OnLineGames family targeting the virtual identities of online gamers. The
share of intercepted infiltrations of this type of threat reached 14.12% in Poland and 11.23%
in France.

As far as the region of Northern Europe is concerned, it is dominated by an array of
malware grouped under the WMA/TrojanDownloader.GetCodec category. The same applies
for the countries of Benelux. These Trojans are engineered to go through all the digital
music files, modifying their format in such a way that upon execution, a malicious content is
downloaded from a pre-defined web-site. The share of occurrence of this form of malware
has reached 4.01% in Sweden, 12.66% in Norway; 12.46% in Estonia and 15.53% in
Belgium.
INF/Autorun remains a top threat in the United Arab Emirates (9.55%) and Israel (4.64%).
