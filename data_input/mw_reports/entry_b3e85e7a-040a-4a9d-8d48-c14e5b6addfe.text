Nymaim Moves Past Its Ransomware Roots - What Is Old Is New Again

2/8

February 26, 2016 Proofpoint Staff
Most malware that we see is distributed through spam sent out by botnets. Other malware
comes through "drive-by downloads" from compromised or malicious websites. Now one
attacker is using legitimate bulk email services to spread the Nymaim Trojan, an alarming
shift that could make such attacks harder to detect.
Nymaim is a 2-year-old strain of malware most closely associated with ransomware. We
have seen recent attacks spreading it using an established email marketing service provider
to avoid blacklists and detection tools. But instead of ransomware, the malware is now being
used to distribute banking Trojans.
Originally observed in 2013, the Nymaim Trojan was installing ransomware before fileencrypting malware was making headlines and extorting money from people, hospitals, and
even the police. At that time, Nymaim was largely distributed via the Black Hole Exploit Kit
(BHEK) as a "drive-by download.” Later, the actors behind the distribution of Nymaim began
manipulating search results so that sites compromised with BHEK were more likely to get
clicks. By 2014, researchers found machines infected with Nymaim that also contained
traces of other malware including Vawtrak, Miuref, Pony, and Ursnif.
Although most famously associated with early ransomware, Nymaim is, at its core, a
downloader Trojan that can be used to install a variety of malware. Recently, we have been
tracking new vectors and payloads for Nymaim, with multiple campaigns utilizing email to
send document attachments or URLs leading to documents. When users open one of these
documents, the macros download and install Nymaim. Then, in most cases, Nymaim installs
the Ursnif banking Trojan on vulnerable PCs.
The emails include links from legitimate domains used by the service provider but redirect
users to malicious macro-embedded documents to deliver Nymaim. It is unclear whether the
threat actors are using a compromised account on the email marketing service or signed up

for a free trial. In either case, the trend marks a departure from their usual reliance on
botnets—and could make them harder to detect.

Not surprisingly, using a well-known email marketing service can improve the effectiveness
of the attacks by improving link reputation, keeping senders on whitelists, and bypassing
sampling by multiple security vendors who deliberately exclude bulk mailing services.
In other campaigns, Nymaim is being delivered through even more circuitous means. On
February 17, for example, we tracked a malicious document attachment campaign in which
Microsoft Word documents attached to emails with subjects "February payment" or "Fedex
Delivery Notification" used macros to drop Pony onto PCs.
Pony is a Trojan with credential-stealing capabilities. In this case it is used to download
Nymaim, which in turn may then download other malware such as Ursnif.
Email is the top vector for delivering Nymaim in these recent campaigns (whether via
attached malicious documents or links to malicious URLs). We have identified two other
interesting features in these new campaigns:

Nymaim still appears to be using some of the same web injects (hence targeting the
same organizations) as it did in campaigns from 2013 and 2014, even while actors are
employing other means (like VBA macros) to deliver the malware.
Nymaim is heavily obfuscating both its own functions and that of its payload (at least in
the case of Ursnif) in memory. This move makes analyzing and reverse-engineering it
harder.
In Figure 3, Nymaim is monitoring and replacing content of a banking website while the user
is browsing it. This screenshot shows traffic generated by the malware to its injection control
IP address 31.184.234[.]21. The malware reports that the user is visiting a banking site. It
then receives instructions on how to modify and replace content to initiate fraud on the user’s
account.

Nymaim is hardly new. But these campaigns bring some new approaches to the table.
Abusing an email marketing service brings a number of benefits to the actors and leaves
many recipients potentially more vulnerable to attack. It's possible to blacklist IP addresses
associated with the botnets that typically distribute malware via email. But in this case, the
campaign uses a known "good" mail distribution vector.

6/8

Without more advanced analysis in a sandbox environment, these kinds of attacks are
difficult to catch. At the same time, actors are leveraging Nymaim's capabilities as a loader
and its flexibility to distribute the latest banking Trojans.
In other words, what is old is new again, and Nymaim has been revitalized to meet current
demands from threat actors.
