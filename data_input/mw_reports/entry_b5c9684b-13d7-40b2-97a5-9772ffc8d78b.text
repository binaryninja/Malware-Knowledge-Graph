FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Wednesday, March 9, 2022
A man charged with conducting ransomware attacks against multiple victims, including the
July 2021 attack against Kaseya, made his initial appearance and was arraigned today in the
Northern District of Texas.
According to an August 2021 indictment, Yaroslav Vasinskyi, 22, accessed the internal
computer networks of several victim companies and deployed Sodinokibi/REvil ransomware
to encrypt the data on the computers of victim companies.
“When last year I announced charges against members of the Sodinokibi/REvil ransomware
group, I made clear that the Justice Department will spare no resource in identifying and
bringing to justice transnational cybercriminals who target the American people,” said
Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. “That is exactly what we have done. The United States,
alongside our international partners, will continue to swiftly identify, locate, and apprehend
alleged cybercriminals, capture their illicit profits, and bring them to justice.”
“Just eight months after committing his alleged ransomware attack on Kaseya from overseas,
this defendant has arrived in a Dallas courtroom to face justice,” said Deputy Attorney
General Lisa O. Monaco. “When we are attacked, we will work with our partners here and
abroad to go after cybercriminals, wherever they may be.”
According to the indictment, Vasinskyi was allegedly responsible for the July 2, 2021,
ransomware attack against Kaseya. In the alleged attack against Kaseya, Vasinskyi caused the
deployment of malicious Sodinokibi/REvil code throughout a Kaseya product that caused the
Kaseya production functionality to deploy REvil ransomware to “endpoints” on Kaseya
customer networks. After the remote access to Kaseya endpoints was established, the
ransomware was executed on those computers, which resulted in the encryption of data on
computers of organizations around the world that used Kaseya software.

Through the deployment of Sodinokibi/REvil ransomware, the defendant allegedly left
electronic notes in the form of a text file on the victims’ computers. The notes included a web
address leading to an open-source privacy network known as Tor, as well as the link to a
publicly accessible website address the victims could visit to recover their files. Upon visiting
either website, victims were given a ransom demand and provided a virtual currency address
to use to pay the ransom. If a victim paid the ransom, the defendant provided the decryption
key and the victim then was able to access their files. If a victim did not pay the ransom, the
defendant typically posted the victim’s stolen data or claimed they sold the stolen data to
third parties, and victims remained unable to access their files.
Vasinskyi is charged with conspiracy to commit fraud and related activity in connection with
computers, damage to protected computers, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. If
convicted of all counts, he faces a total penalty of 115 years in prison. A federal district court
judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other
statutory factors.
Vasinskyi, a Ukrainian national with ties to a ransomware group linked to Russia-based
actors, was taken into custody in Poland where he remained held by authorities pending
proceedings in connection with his requested extradition to the United States, pursuant to
the extradition treaty between the United States and the Republic of Poland. Vasinskyi was
transported to Dallas by U.S. law enforcement authorities where he arrived on March 3. He
made his initial court appearance and was arraigned today in the Northern District of Texas.
The FBI’s Dallas and Jackson Field Offices are leading the investigation. Substantial
assistance was provided by the Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs and the
National Security Division’s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Tiffany H. Eggers for the Northern District of Texas and Senior
Counsel Byron M. Jones of the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property
Section are prosecuting the case.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Texas, the FBI’s Dallas and Jackson
Field Offices and the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section
conducted the operation in close cooperation with Europol and Eurojust, which were an
integral part of coordination. Investigators and prosecutors from several jurisdictions,
including Romania's National Police and the Directorate for Investigating Organised Crime
and Terrorism; Canada’s Royal Canadian Mounted Police; France’s Court of Paris and BL2C
(anti-cybercrime unit police); the Dutch National Police; Poland’s National Prosecutor’s
Office, Border Guard, Internal Security Agency, and Ministry of Justice; and the
governments of Norway and Australia provided valuable assistance.
The U.S. Department of the Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the
Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
(CISA); Germany’s Public Prosecutor’s Office Stuttgart and State Office of Criminal
