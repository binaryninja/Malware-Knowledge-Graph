WHY FOCUS ON PROCESS INJECTION?

1/5

Process Injection encompasses a wide array of malicious behaviors that offer adversaries
an inconspicuous method of evading defensive controls, elevating their privilege level, or
otherwise executing arbitrary code. It’s so broad that in the next ATT&CK release, MITRE is
recategorizing the technique into 11 sub-techniques.
As such, this is the perfect time for an in-depth, technical conversation exploring the ways
that adversaries leverage Process Injection, what malicious process injection looks like, and
how you can detect it.
See highlight clips from the Process Injection webinar.
01:25 Panelist Introduction
02:10 What Red Canary Does
02:35 Process Injection Definition
02:48 “Process injection is a way of running arbitrary code in another process’s memory
space.” – Adam
03:30 Why Leverage Process Injection
03:50 “It can be a very good way to evade defenders and defensive controls that are
focused around specific tools.” – Adam
04:55 Sub-techniques of Process Injection
05:20 “Process injection, which is a fairly broad technique, has been broken out into 11
different sub-techniques which are more specific techniques or ways of actually doing
process injection.” – Adam
05:45 Webinar Agenda
07:11 Portable Executable Injection
08:09 “The ability to inject that into another process and then invoking it by spawning a new
thread.” – Matt
09:40 “This technique offers an attacker particular flexibility in that it facilitates direct
injection into their target.” – Matt
10:57 Ramnit
11:15 “In the case of Ramnit, it injects a traditional DLL into a browser process.” – Matt
13:55 Observing PE Injection

2/5

14:14 “What are the absolute minimum requirements an attacker has imposed in order to
successfully carry out the attack technique?” – Matt
17:05 Detecting PE Injection
18:15 “Since they’re already writing their own position-independent code, there’s no hard
requirement that they must write a PE header into the memory space of another process,
but a lot of malware does.” – Matt
21:30 Thread Local Storage
22:29 “Although it is kind of uncommon, it can be a successful anti-analysis technique
because typically analysis is going to start at the entry point of the PE, and this malware is
going to get executed before that is reached.” – Erika
22:52 Ursnif
23:05 “It’s often spread via malicious Office documents” – Erika
23:23 Observing Malicious TLS Callbacks
23:29 “Within the PE header itself, there is a TLS directory which contains information
about TLS data objects. These thread local storage objects basically allow each thread to
have its own static data area for custom variables, or custom thread initialization routines
that they want to employ.” – Erika
28:29 Detecting Malicious TLS Callbacks
29:22 “We talked about some of the APIs that are used by this technique, you can
obviously detect the usage of those, but the usage of any one of those by itself is not going
to indicate malicious activity.” – Erika
30:38 Process Hollowing
31:00 “It allows an attacker to carve out the executable section of a legitimate or benign
process and replace it with their own payload.” – David
33:42 Process Hollowing: Generalized Technique
36:05 “Once the attacker has obtained the PE address, the third step is to perform the
hollowing itself.” – David
41:55 Trickbot
42:32 “What’s interesting for us as technical defenders is that we use a number of varied
techniques taking shape.” – David

3/5

43:52 Process Hollowing: Trickbot
45:30 “They create a section that describes their unpacked code. This is created within the
originator process, meaning within the malware process itself. They create a new section
that describes the unpacked code to inject or make resident within the hollowed process.” –
David
47:52 Detecting Process Hollowing
51:12 “It’s difficult to get a robust detection at scale.” – David
52:16 Linux
57:09 “We only had these three Linux-only techniques in ATT&CK today.” – Adam
57:26 MacOS
57:38 “Injection isn’t seen in malware on the Mac platform, and there are a few reasons for
that. The most prevalent being that it is much harder than getting the user to click on
something and type in their password.” – Erika
01:00:52 Mitigating Process Injection
1:01:02 “There is no specific mitigation against all forms of process injection.” – Matt
01:04:05 Questions & Answers
We will be following up with questions and answers in a blog post soon.
