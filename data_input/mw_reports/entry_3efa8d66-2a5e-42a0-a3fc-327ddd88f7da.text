The threat group’s targeting shift could reflect a change in China’s intelligence collection
requirements due to the war in Ukraine. Wednesday, April 27, 2022 By: Counter Threat Unit

Government-sponsored threat actors collect intelligence to benefit their country, and changes
to the political landscape can impact the collection requirements. The war in Ukraine has
prompted many countries to deploy their cyber capabilities to gain insight about global
events, political machinations, and motivations. This desire for situational awareness often
extends to collecting intelligence from allies and “friends,” which could explain why
Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers detected what appears to be an
attempt by China to deploy advanced malware to computer systems of Russian officials.
In March 2022, CTU™ researchers analyzed a malicious executable file masquerading as a
Russian-language document. The filename is Благовещенск - Благовещенский
пограничный отряд.exe ("Blagoveshchensk - Blagoveshchensk Border Detachment.exe"),
but the default settings on Windows system do not display the .exe file extension. The file
uses a portable document file (PDF) icon for credibility. Blagoveshchensk is a Russian city
close to the China border and is home to the 56th Blagoveshchenskiy Red Banner Border
Guard Detachment. This connection suggests that the filename was chosen to target officials
or military personnel familiar with the region.
The heavily obfuscated executable file downloads additional files from a staging server at
107 . 178 . 71 . 211 (see Table 1).

The executable file displays the decoy document (see Figure 1) to the victim. This document
is written in English and appears to be legitimate, although CTU researchers were unable to
locate the original source. It describes the migratory pressure and asylum applications in
countries that border Belarus (Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland) and discusses European Union
(EU) sanctions against Belarus at the beginning of March 2022. CTU researchers are
unclear why a file with a Russian filename downloads an English-language document.

The other three files downloaded from the staging server are typical of the China-based
BRONZE PRESIDENT threat group's use of DLL search order hijacking to execute PlugX
malware payloads. The inclusion of the ping command with the "-n 70" option (see Figure 2)
adds a significant delay before executing the legitimate signed file. The IP address used for
the ping command is Google's public DNS service.

The legitimate signed file originates from UK-based Global Graphics Software Ltd. Because
it is vulnerable to DLL search order hijack, it imports the malicious DocConvDll.dll DLL
loader. This DLL exports eight functions, several of which use seemingly random names and
contain no useful instructions. The only export called by the parent executable is
createSystemFontsUsingEDL (see Figure 3).

The createSystemFontsUsingEDL function loads, decrypts, and executes FontLog.dat. The
.dat sample obtained by CTU researchers was corrupt, but based on similar campaigns the
file is likely a PlugX payload. However, analysis of the loader suggests that the malware
creates a directory structure under C:\ProgramData (C:\ProgramData\Fuji Xerox\Fonts\) and
then copies the three files that DLL side-load and execute the payload to this directory. Once
PlugX is installed, the malware provides access to the compromised host to extract sensitive
system information, upload and download files, and execute a remote command shell.
The staging server (107 . 178 . 71 . 211) hosts the zyber-i . com domain. This domain has
been implicated in a broad PlugX campaign targeting European diplomatic entities. The
domain was hosted on 103 . 107 . 104 . 19 from March 2-13, when it served a similarly
named group of files for DLL search order hijack. A third-party report links the campaign to
the locvnpt . com domain. Another report associates the locvnpt . com domain with attacks in
2020 against the Vatican that CTU researchers attribute to BRONZE PRESIDENT. This 2020
campaign also used customized decoy documents and downloaded PlugX .dat files that
were loaded by DLL search order hijack. The locvnpt . com domain was hosted on 2EZ
Networks (IP address 167 . 88 . 177 . 151) in September 2020. BRONZE PRESIDENT
extensively used that company's IP range in a 2020 campaign targeting Hong Kong,
Myanmar, and Vietnam (see Figure 4).

BRONZE PRESIDENT appears to be changing its targeting in response to the political
situation in Europe and the war in Ukraine. The threat group has primarily focused on
Southeast Asia, gathering political and economic intelligence valuable to the People's
Republic of China (PRC). Targeting Russian-speaking users and European entities suggests
that the threat actors have received updated tasking that reflects the changing intelligence
collection requirements of the PRC.
To mitigate exposure to this malware, CTU researchers recommend that organizations use
available controls to review and restrict access using the indicators listed in Table 2. Note
that IP addresses can be reallocated. The domains, IP addresses, and URLs may contain
malicious content, so consider the risks before opening them in a browser.
