Toddler - Malware Analysis Report

What’s new ?
Starting from the second half of 2020, the PTI team witnessed a rising trend
of mobile banking malware attacks against the European countries ; primarily
targeting customers of banking institutions based in Spain, Germany, Switzerland,
and Netherlands. Toddler is considered to be an important example of this trend in
terms of it’s technical features and operational chain.
Why does it matter ?
Stealing banking credentials of end users have become the most prominent
method for cyber-fraud. These high-end mobile banking botnets enable attackers to
bypass additional layers of security such as OTP and 2nd Factor authentication while
presenting new opportunities for social engineering attacks. Therefore, these trends
are expected to result in high amounts of fraud losses for both banking institutions
and end-users if fraud mechanisms are not put in place accordingly.
What should be done ?
Inner mechanics of Toddler malware should be analyzed by security operation teams
and fraud divisions of finance institutions for the purpose of implementing multiple
layers of security to prevent pre- and post-infection phases. Detection and takedown
of malicious URLs (e.g. U.S.T.A) in a timely manner and running anti-malware SDKs (e.g.
SKALA) on end-user devices already showed some progress to quickly repel these
type of cyber attacks. However, most of the financial organizations are still unaware
of the problem as mobile malware is spreading at a fast pace than ever before.

PRO-2021071606
PTI Team
22.05.2021
16.07.2021

In this report, we present a behind-the-scenes analysis of an emerging Android
malware named Toddler1 (a.k.a. Teabot, Anatsa, ...). At the time of the analysis, Toddler
is largely targeting Spain, but the malware sample contains textual content for
targeting Spanish, English, Italian, German, French, and Dutch-speaking users. The PTI
team has identified the following Android application names used by the Toddler
campaign : “BPOST”, “UPS”, and “Correos”, The PTI team has de-anonymized the C&C
server and discovered that Toddler has already infected more than 7,632 devices and
stolen over 1023 banking credentials at the time of writing this report. Statistics and
observations from the main C&C panel are also provided in detail. Toddler has all of
the generic banking malware features such as overlay attack and SMS stealing for
OTP, but the key differences are that it :
device reboot by closing the reboot UI (and prevents boot into safe
• prevents
mode) ;
very persistent and has multiple removal prevention mechanisms, making it
• isalmost
impossible to be removed by end users ;
• uses multiple hacked legitimate websites for hosting the malicious APK file.

Toddler - Malware Analysis Report

Executive Summary
1.1

Overview

This report is based on findings obtained from the analysis of Toddler malware operation,
conducted by different cyber-crime groups for the purpose of stealing banking credentials
and personally identifiable information (”PII”) of end-users.
Following its detailed research on both malware sample and command and control server
of Toddler cybercrime operation, PTI team was able to discover numerous important details
which indicate an ongoing trend against banking customers in E.U. states. PTI has reached
this conclusion due to the fact that ; (1) ”Toddler” malware was pre-configured to act against
mobile applications of multiple EU-based banking institutions and (2) most of the infected
victims were detected to be users of these EU-based banks (with a meaningful concentration
on Spain and Switzerland based organizations).

1.2

Working Mechanism

Our analysis on Toddler malware sample has further revealed that Toddler uses overlay
attacks to perform ”webview-based application phishing”. The malware mainly targets
mobile banking and cryptocurrency applications but also gathers a wide range of user
data from all installed applications on the victim’s device.
Analyst Note : ”Webview-based application phishing” is the most common method used
by banking malware applications. This technique is based on bringing a fake login screen
in front of an actual mobile banking application in order to trick the end-user to fill in
their credentials. Unfortunately ; it is visually not possible for an end-user to notice these
”overlay” attacks, as their timing and design is virtually indistinguishable.
Upon installation, Toddler malware instantly starts tracking applications being launched on
the device. Once it detects a target application launch (e.g. when the end-user clicks on
his/her mobile banking application on the device), the malware starts an overlay attack.
Toddler downloads the specially crafted login page for the opened target application
from its C&C server. The downloaded webview phishing page is then laid over the target
application. The user suspects nothing because this event happens almost instantaneously
when the legitimate application is opened. Once the application credentials are entered
into the overlayed phishing page, Toddler malware sends these credentials to the C&C
server controlled by the attacker.
As also discussed in the latter sections of this report ; Toddler banking malware operation is
capable of ;
Remotely controlling the victims device and simulating inseparable user behavior ;
Reading SMS messages and send these messages to Command and Control server of
the operation in order to bypass SMS OTP precautions,

Current Impact and Future Forecasts

Starting from the mid 2020 ; PTI has been working on different mobile banking botnets
targeting EU member states (for reference, please see our reports on FluBot and BrunHilda).
Toddler has been found to be another important example of this trend with multiple
interesting features.
During PTI’s analysis on Toddler’s Command and Control servers ; a total of 7632 devices
have been detected to be infected. As a result of these infections ; 1023 banking credentials
were detected to be stolen. Even though Toddler is pre-configured to act against dozens
of different banking institutions ; our team has witnessed that 100 percent of infected
end-users were customers of 18 financial institutions. Among these 18 banking institutions ; 5
organizations were witnessed to be the main targets with nearly 90 percent of all infections
(remaining 10 percent were shared among the remaining 13 different banks). This is thought to
be resulting from a partially targeted SMS-Phishing campaign, aimed at specific user groups.
Similar to Flubot, which had been initially discovered to be primarily targeting Spain but
then detected to be used very effectively in multiple different EU member states ; Toddler is
forecasted to be another notorious mobile banking malware with a potential of creating
fundamental fraud losses for both banking organizations and customers in short-to-medium
future.

Command and Control Panel

At the time of analysis, The PTI team extracted the C&C server address http://185.215.113.31
from the Toddler malware sample. After performing deep enumeration on the
target host, the PTI team was able to detect the C&C login page at the path
http://185.215.113.31/kioglsehnoiergnsoeigniseogosegnr/. At this point, the PTI team started
scanning the entire global IPv4 range for a React application login page with the same path
for detecting another Toddler C&C server. Scan results revealed a host that could potentially
be another Toddler C&C server at 188.116.27.100.

With the help of the data gathered in the deep enumeration phase, the PTI team was able to
deanonymize and analyze the contents of the C&C panel of the Toddler servers. The botnet
panel is a React application with a REST API exposed on address http://185.215.113.31:82/api/

Conclusion

The number of mobile banking malware types has been increasing at an alarming rate
over the past five years. The PTI team has investigated multiple mobile botnets during
2021 that are significantly advanced over their predecessors in terms of rapid spreading,
obfuscation, and domain generation capabilities. One of the most recent examples of mobile
malware, dubbed ”FluBot” by the PTI team, shows similar characteristics with the Toddler
malware. We can immediately observe ”Spain” as the target country in both cases. It should
also be noted that in both cases, cybercriminals used the same company names to disguise
their malware. Apart from their similarities, Toddler sets a new precedent for persistence
module implementation. Removal of the malware from the device requires huge technical
expertise and it looks like the process will not get easier in the future. Within a very short
time frame, Toddler was able to infect more than 7,632 mobile phones. We recommend that
everyone read the guidelines of the Spanish CERT, INCIBE, for further details related to the
”FluBot” and the ”Toddler” malware.
