In November 2019, we published a blog analyzing an exploit kit we named Capesand that exploited Adobe
Flash and Microsoft Internet Explorer ﬂaws. During our analysis of the indicators of compromise (IoCs) in
the deployed samples that were infecting the victim’s machines, we noticed some interesting characteristics:
notably that these samples were making use of obfuscation tools that made them virtually undetectable.
After some data collection we found more than 300 samples that correlate to the mentioned indicators that
were recently very active our ﬁrst detections occurred in August, with the campaign itself still ongoing
(having occasional spikes in between). We saw a rising usage of tools that provide fully-undetectable

obfuscation capabilities – signifying that the authors behind the samples designed their malware variants to
be as stealthy as possible. We decided to name the potential campaign associated with these IoCs as
“KurdishCoder”, based on the property name of an assembly module found in one of the samples.
We took a look at one of the samples captured from Capesand that was used to deploy the njRat malware –
notably its main executable NotepadEx. We found that were multiple layers of obfuscation using a
combination of two tools: the .NET protectors ConfuserEx and Cassandra (CyaX). Both of these tools are
used in combination to provide an array of fully undetectable capabilities to the deployed njRat malware
variant.
Examining the Capesand samples
The simpliﬁed diagram taken from the previous blog shows the combination of ConfuserEx and Cassandra
via the second layer of obfuscation protection, which involves the DLL CyaX_Sharp Assembly (both
CyaX_Sharp and CyaX are part of the Cassandra protector).

Figure 1. The infection chain for Capesand that also shows the obfuscation mechanisms
For this particular sample, CyaX_Sharp is obfuscated with a customized version of ConfuserEx. The
following image shows an assembly module property that was generated for this sample.

Figure 2. The generated assembly module property
The module’s property name is “KurdishCoderProducts”, with a value shown to be “ConfuserEx v1.0.0custom”. To understand where this value is coming from, let’s take a look at the open-source ConfuserEx
tool to see how the values are created. From there, we can establish a hypothesis as to their source.
A closer look at ConfuserEx’s functions
While ConfuserEx is able to apply multiple transformations to the target binary, we are interested in two
particular functions that we can use for correlation:
1. Source code building.
ConfuserEx is an open-source tool with multiple versions hosted on Github. By examining one of the
community-supported versions, we can see there is a tool to build ConfuserEx from the command line. This
build command line has a function to update the ﬁnal binary versions based on the last Git-tagged version.
However, if ConfuserEx is built outside Git, the version update tool will just generate the value “versioncustom” as shown below.

Figure 3. Code taken from a ConfuserEx version created outside GIT
Since the string “ConfuserEx v1.0.0-custom” is present in the module property: [module:
KurdishCoderProducts(“ConfuserEx v1.0.0-custom”)]”, we can surmise that the version of ConfuserEx that
was used for CyaX_Sharp was indeed built outside of Git.
1. Watermarking
When ConfuserEx performs its obfuscation routine, one of the operations creates a watermark – a unique
identiﬁer within the software–that is present in the ﬁnal binary. The watermarking technique is implemented
through the module attributes of the assembly. The following source code screenshot shows how this is
implemented.

Figure 4. Code showing how the watermarking is performed via the module attributes of the assembly
From the previous code section, we can see the default attribute added by ConfuserEx is “ConfusedBy”. If
we test it using a sample binary, the following is generated:

Figure 5. Testing a sample binary using ConfuserEx
There are two important aspects to this attribute: ﬁrst, it is hardcoded as a string constant and second, its
value is presented in clear text in the ﬁnal binary as the following image shows.

Figure 6. The default attribute shown in clear text in the ﬁnal binary
We now have solid evidence that CyaX_Sharp was obfuscated using a modiﬁed version of ConfuserEx,
Next, let’s look for the attribute indicator, starting with the CyaX assembly used in the NotepadEx attack.
Cassandra Protector: CyaX
After inspection we noticed that this version of CyaX was similarly notable due to two characteristics.
First, the debug symbols paths were leaked — suggesting a possible custom build which can be correlated
with another modiﬁcation applied to CyaX.

Figure 7. The leaked debug symbols paths
The second indicator has to do with one of the methods of CyaX which was modiﬁed — speciﬁcally the one
injecting the binary in memory.
The following image shows the modiﬁed function name.

What other payloads are using KurdishCoder?
Analysis of some of the captured samples reveals the different payloads being used (as shown in the table
below). Note that this does not cover all the samples – it is possible that other payloads are being deployed as
well.

Cassandra Crypter
We think one of the possible sources of the customized ConfuserEx is the online service Cassandra Crypter,
which offers two kinds of subscription plans: The Premium Plan and the Private Stub. The Premium Plan

requires payment and works automatically, while the Private Stub requires the user to contact the support
from the service for further personalization.

Figure 9. Cassandra Crypter’s subscription plans
The combination of ConfuserEx and CyaX (Cassandra protector) seems to be unique and customized based
on the indicators mentioned earlier. While we don’t have deﬁnitive evidence that the use of these tools are
part of a single campaign, we think the analyzed samples are related to a speciﬁc campaign. Note that the
KurdishCoder indicator was spotted also by the Italian Computer Emergency Response Team – Pubblica
Amministrazione (CERT-PA), which they reported as a single incident.
As with Capesand, we will be monitoring the use of the tools mentioned in this blog entry for any future
developments and updates.
