Several Polish banks said they suffered malware infections after their employees visited the
site of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF), which had been previously infected
to host a malicious JavaScript file.
Zaufana Trzecia Strona, a local Polish news site, first reported the attacks late Friday, last
week. The news site said that during the past week, the security teams at several, yet
unnamed, Polish banks detected downloads of suspicious files and encrypted traffic going
to uncommon IPs situated in many foreign countries.
As employees at different banks started looking into their systems, they found malware
installed on numerous workstations and even some servers.

KNF website hosted malicious JavaScript file
Subsequent investigations and a cooperation between different banks eventually
discovered the source of the infection as being the official website of KNF, which, ironically,
is the regulating body that keeps an eye out for the security of financial systems in Poland.

According to reports, KNF's website had been compromised for well over a week, as an
unidentified attacker had modified one of the site's JavaScript files.

KNF website (via: Zaufana Trzecia Strona)
Visitors accessing the KNF website would load the malicious JavaScript file as part of the
website's regular resources.

JavaScript file would lead to RAT infection
The JavaScript code worked by opening a hidden iframe and forcibly downloading a file on
the victim's computers. Users that discovered and executed this file would install a remote
access trojan (RAT) on their computers.
According to Zaufana Trzecia Strona, this malware has a zero detection rate on VirusTotal
and appears to be a new malware strain, never-before-seen in live attacks.
KNF's staff have cleaned their site and along with the affected banks, have reported the
incidents to CERT.pl. They also released a statement acknowledging the website hack on
Friday, but haven't provided other details about the attack.
The affected Polish banks said the malware that infected their computers and servers
encrypted its outgoing traffic and they weren't able to tell what the attackers stole.

No customer funds stolen
Banks reassured their clients and said they haven't detected any unauthorized transactions,
but only the mysterious outgoing traffic.

Local media believes the attack is the work of a foreign intelligence agency. A more
believable theory would be that this is the work of one of the many cyber-crime syndicates
specialized in cyber-thefts from financial institutions.
The attacks have the signs of classic network reconnaissance operations, where hackers
gather intelligence in order to create a map of a victim's network before launching their final
assaults.
