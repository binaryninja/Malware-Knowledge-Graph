Figure. How the Trickbot botnet works

What is Trickbot?

1/5

Trickbot is a major botnet consisting of computers that have been infected with the Trickbot
Trojan (Trojan.Trickybot). The Trojan is modular in nature, meaning it can easily be
customized with one or more of an array of custom components designed to carry out a
range of malicious activities on infected computers. To date, it has mainly been used for two
main purposes: stealing credentials from infected computers and acting as a distribution
channel for other malware. Symantec believes that Trickbot’s operators earn most of their
revenue from selling stolen credentials on the cyber underground and leasing out the botnet
as a distribution channel for other malware authors.
Trickbot is spread through spam and phishing email campaigns which usually bear a
Microsoft Word attachment containing malicious macros. If the document is opened by the
unsuspecting user, Trickbot will be installed on the victim’s computer. In some cases, other
malware, particularly ransomware, is also installed on the victim’s computer.
Trickbot will also attempt to leverage known software vulnerabilities to move across the
victim’s network and install itself on other computers.

How Trickbot works
Trickbot is modular malware, capable of performing a range of different malicious activities.
The first module to be installed on the victim’s computer is the loader, which contains an
encrypted list of IP addresses from which it can download its main module.
Once downloaded, the main module will check the architecture of the victim computer and
save this along with the bot’s own information. The main component then prepares a
framework for additional modules and initiates a connection to one of a pre-configured list of
command and control (C&C) servers.
The main module downloads one or more additional modules. Known modules include:
Banking credential stealer (injectDll): For injecting malicious content into browser
windows displaying banking websites in order to steal credentials
Reconnaissance module (networkDll): For gathering system information and
network/domain topology to determine whether the device can be infected with
ransomware
Data stealer (importDll): For stealing data from a web browser
Password grabber (Pwgrab: For stealing passwords from various locations
Cookie stealer (cookiesDll): For stealing cookies from the infected computer
Information stealer (mailsearcher): For searching all files in all drives in the system
looking for specific information
Point-of-Sale recon (psfin): Reconnaissance module to determine if there are any
Point-of-Sale (POS) devices connected
Remote control module (vncDll): Virtual Network Computing (VNC) module

2/5

SMB spreader (tabDll): For spreading over Server Message Block (SMB) using the
EternalRomance exploit and other vulnerabilities patched by Microsoft in March 2017
(MS17-010)
Outlook stealer (outlookDll): For stealing data saved by Microsoft Outlook
Lateral movement module (shareDll): For lateral movement/enumeration via
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and SMB exploitation
Lateral movement module (wormDll): For lateral movement/enumeration via LDAP and
SMB exploitation. The shareDll and wormDll modules work in cooperation.
RDP brute-force module (rdpScanDll): A new module that uses brute-forces the
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) for a specific list of victims

Stealthy threat
Trickbot includes a number of features designed to minimize the risk of detection by security
software. For example, the main module is designed to evade execution within “sandboxes,”
which are controlled environments used by security companies to analyze malware.
This module will also check the current user’s privileges and, if they have low privileges, it
will elevate them using User Access Control (UAC) bypass, a technique that allows
execution of programs with elevated privileges without the user being prompted.
When it obtains elevated privileges, Trickbot will attempt to identify any security software that
is installed on the computer and attempt to stop it and end any related services.

Credential theft
One of the main threats for Trickbot victims is credential theft. This is carried out by a module
that monitors for browser visits to a pre-configured list of banking websites. If the user visits
any of these websites, the module intercepts and alters network traffic between the computer
and the website, allowing the attackers to steal the victim’s banking credentials after they are
input by the user.
Trickbot will also attempt to steal other credentials from Chrome and Internet Explorer’s
password storage features, from various RDP and SSH related services, and from other
password managers.

Immediate threat
While infected computers are added to the Trickbot botnet, they yield the most value to
attackers immediately after infection. Other malware families are usually delivered at the
point of initial infection. Credential theft happens immediately after infection, while banking
credentials are stolen the first time the victim attempts to log into their bank. Even if the

malware is subsequently detected and the computer is removed from the botnet, much of the
damage will have been done at this point, with stolen credentials exfiltrated by the attackers
and likely sold to other cyber criminals.

Ongoing battle
By pooling resources and intelligence and utilizing available legal avenues, the information
security and financial sectors hope to strike a major blow against Trickbot. Symantec is
grateful for the leadership of Microsoft and FS-ISAC and the support of ESET, NTT, and
Lumen Technologies. This latest action, however, is just one step in an ongoing campaign.
Complete eradication of this botnet will likely require additional actions from government
partners in multiple jurisdictions. However, this action proves that successful private industry
collaboration can be effective in countering cyber-crime and we hope that this set a new
precedent for further initiatives.

Protection
The following protections are in place to protect customers against Trickbot activity:
Trojan.Trickybot
SONAR.Trickybot
Trojan.Trickybot!g7
Trojan.Trickybot!g8
Trojan.Trickybot!g11
Trojan.Trickybot!g13
Trojan.Trickybot!g16
Trojan.Trickybot!gen2
Trojan.Trickybot!gen5
Trojan.Trickybot!gm

Mitigation
Symantec recommends users observe the following best practices to protect against Trickbot
attacks:
Enable 2FA to prevent compromise of credentials.
Harden security architecture around email systems to minimize the amount of
spam that reaches end-user inboxes and ensure you are following best practices for
your email system, including the use of SPF and other defensive measures against
phishing attacks.
Restrict access to RDP Services: Only allow RDP from specific known IP addresses
and ensure you are using multi-factor authentication.

4/5

Implement proper audit and control of administrative account usage: You could
also implement one-time credentials for administrative work to help prevent theft and
usage of admin credentials.
Create profiles of usage for admin tools: Many of these tools are used by
ransomware attackers to move laterally undetected through a network. A user account
that has a history of running as admin using PsInfo/PsExec on a small number of
systems is probably fine, but a service account running PsInfo/PsExec on all systems
is suspicious.
