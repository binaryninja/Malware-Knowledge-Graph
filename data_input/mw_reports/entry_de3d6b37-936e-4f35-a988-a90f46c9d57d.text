CYBER THREATS
TO THE ENTERTAINMENT
AND MEDIA INDUSTRIES

ENTERTAINMENT AND MEDIA COMPANIES FACE CYBER THREATS FROM THE FOLLOWING ACTORS:
• Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)1 groups assisting their sponsoring government in controlling its national
image by stealing information related to media organizations’ reporting activities, including personnel, sources,
local partnerships, anticipated public releases, general country operations, and specific areas of research.
• APT groups engaging in economic espionage to provide their indigenous entertainment and media
companies with a competitive advantage through stealing data related to other companies’ mergers,
acquisitions, or distribution; technologies or processes for advanced production; and creative
intellectual property.
• Hacktivists and APT groups seeking to disrupt a victim company’s operations to promote a cause, control
reporting, or contain the dissemination of content that they consider politically sensitive or controversial. APT
groups may potentially try to mask the identity of their government sponsor by posing as an independent
hacktivist group when targeting a victim company.
• Enterprise-like cybercriminals seeking personal profit through targeting the gaming industry and stealing
account credentials, activation codes, in-game valuables, and personally identifiable information (PII).
CASE STUDY: APT28 SUSPECTED IN FALSE FLAG OPERATION ON FRENCH MEDIA COMPANY
In April 2015, threat actors compromised TV5 Monde, a French news station with a global audience. The actors
damaged equipment, disrupting broadcasts for several hours, and defaced the company’s website and social
media accounts with propaganda pertaining to ISIS and the CyberCaliphate, a hacktivist group allegedly
associated with ISIS. However, although the activity initially appeared to be the work of the CyberCaliphate,

Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors are assessed to take direction from a nation state to steal information or
conduct network attacks, tenaciously pursue their objectives, and are capable of using a range of tools and tactics.

FireEye Threat Intelligence suspects that APT28, a group associated with the Russian government, was instead responsible
for the activity. APT28 likely posed as the CyberCaliphate to capitalize on Western fears over Islamic extremism, particularly
following the Charlie Hebdo-inspired attacks of several months prior. The compromise of TV5 Monde was likely a Russian
information operation intended to alarm the French, with whom Russia’s relations have been declining (as with the rest of
the West), and draw the West’s attention away from Russia’s ongoing role in the Ukraine crisis and towards the threat of
terrorism in the Middle East.

THREAT HORIZON & INDUSTRY OUTLOOK
The entertainment and media industries play a key role in shaping public opinion and even national image, making it a
valuable target for APT groups and hacktivists seeking influence. The following factors may further influence threat activity
towards these sectors:
• Concerns over domestic stability and government legitimacy will likely result in increased targeting from APT groups
seeking to assist their associated government in monitoring public opinion, shaping its image, promoting its message, and
otherwise leveraging its soft power to maintain and spread its influence.

• Negotiations Information
• Network Infrastructure Documents
• PR and Marketing Materials
• Reporters’ Communications
• User Credentials

• A desire to discourage publication of controversial stories and views may prompt some threat actors to attempt to gain
access to a relevant media organization’s raw reporting and acquire information on the identities of its sources. Statesponsored threat actors aiming to suppress a certain story, for example, may target a media organization reporting on the
topic in an effort to evaluate what the organization knows about the issue, and identify its sources.
• Efforts to intimidate or punish a media organization for publishing a critical or unflattering story might prompt the threat
actors to retaliate by targeting the offending media organization. Threat actors may steal data on employees and sources

in an effort to intimidate or monitor them. There is also the possibility that threat
actors may try to steal and then publicly release sensitive data, in an attempt to
embarrass the targeted organization and damage its credibility.
• Tensions or conflicts between adversaries, whether state or non-state, will
probably lead to increased threat activity from associated threat actors
aiming to prevent their adversary from spreading its own message or
propaganda, while potentially seeking to spread its own propaganda through
its opponents’ channels.

variants were the most
commonly detected in

media sectors:

ChinaChopper

SOGU

• Increased popularity and use of social media will likely lead to continued
targeting of providers and platforms by APT groups, cybercriminals,
and hacktivists aiming to facilitate further targeting through social
engineering, and/or promote their own views through disrupting services
or defacing webpages.

is a small webshell that provides threat actors unauthorized access to an information system using a simple password for authentication and is capable of executing Microsoft
.NET code within HTTP POST commands.
(aka Kaba, PlugX), a backdoor that is capable of file upload and download, arbitrary process execution, filesystem and registry access, service configuration access, remote
shell access, and implementing a custom VNC/RDP-like protocol to provide the command and control (C2) server with graphical access to the desktop.

GH0STRAT

is a remote access tool (RAT) derived from publicly available source code. It can perform screen and audio captures, enable a webcam, list and kill processes, open a
command shell, wipe event logs, and create, manipulate, delete, launch, and transfer files.

POISONIVY

is a publicly available RAT that provides comprehensive remote access capabilities on a compromised system. Its variants are configured, built, and controlled using a
graphical Poison Ivy management interface available online. It can be configured to produce shellcode, which can be packaged into an executable or combined with an
existing executable to hide its presence. It is typically configured to inject multiple shellcode stubs into the explorer.exe process.

Page

(aka ELISE) is a downloader that attempts to retrieve encoded DLLs from a pre-configured command and control server, which it communicates with using HTTP requests.
Once the DLLs are downloaded, the downloader loads them into memory. It also incorporates several source-level anti-reverse engineering functions.

Upatre

is a Trojan downloader that often arrives via a spam email, drive-by download or exploit,. Upatre will download one or more additional types of malware onto an infected
system and has been observed distributing a wide variety of malware including, but not limited to, Zbot, Dyre, Rovnix, CryptoLocker, and Necurs.

Delf

ZeroAccess

Allaple

Muxif

is a family of Trojans whose files are often compiled in Delphi. It has the ability to connect to remote server for downloading and installing additional malware onto the system
without the consent or knowledge of the user and may also have the ability to steal sensitive information.
(aka SIREFEF) is a Trojan with advanced rootkit capabilities. Initially developed as a delivery mechanism for other types of malicious software, it has been re-architected to
perform click fraud.
is a worm that will perform denial of service attacks on specific targets and attempt to propagate to other systems on the same network.

is a Trojan downloader that communicates with a C2 server to send system information, receive instructions, and download additional malicious executables. It also modifies
the registry to maintain persistence.
