The Syrian Electronic Army has made news for its recent attacks on major communications
websites, Forbes, and an alleged attack on CENTCOM. While these attacks garnered public
attention, the activities of another group - The Syrian Malware Team - have gone largely
unnoticed. The group’s activities prompted us to take a closer look. We discovered this group
using a .NET based RAT called BlackWorm to infiltrate their targets.
The Syrian Malware Team is largely pro-Syrian government, as seen in one of their banners
featuring Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Based on the sentiments publicly expressed by
this group it is likely that they are either directly or indirectly involved with the Syrian
government. Further certain members of the Syrian Malware Team have ties to the Syrian
Electronic army (SEA) known to be linked to the Syrian government. This indicates that the
Syrian Malware Team may also be possibly an offshoot or part of the SEA.

BlackWorm Authorship
We found at least two distinct versions of the BlackWorm tool, including an original/private
version (v0.3.0) and the Dark Edition (v2.1). The original BlackWorm builder was co-authored
by Naser Al Mutairi from Kuwait, better known by his online moniker 'njq8'. He is also known
to have coded njw0rm, njRAT/LV, and earlier versions of H-worm/Houdini. We found his code
being used in a slew of other RATs such as Fallaga and Spygate. BlackWorm v0.3.0 was
also co-authored by another actor, Black Mafia.

About section within the original version of BlackWorm builder
Within the underground development forums, it’s common for threat actors to collaborate on
toolsets. Some write the base tools that other attackers can use; others modify and enhance
existing tools.
The BlackWorm builder v2.1 is a prime example of actors modifying and enhancing current
RATs. After njq8 and Black Mafia created the original builder, another author, Black.Hacker,
enhanced its feature set.

As an interesting side note, 'njq8' took down his blog in recent months and announced a
cease in all malware development activity on his Twitter and Facebook account, urging
others to stop as well. This is likely a direct result of the lawsuit filed against him by
Microsoft.

BlackWorm RAT Features
The builder for BlackWorm v0.3.0 is fairly simple and allows for very quick payload, but
doesn’t allow any configuration other than the IP address for command and control (C2).

The Syrian Malware Team primarily uses another version of BlackWorm called the Dark
Edition (v2.1). BlackWorm v2.1 was released on a prolific underground forum where
information and code is often shared, traded and sold.

BlackWorm v2.1 has the same abilities as the original version and additional functionality,
including bypassing UAC, disabling host firewalls and spreading over network shares. Unlike
its predecessor, it also allows for granular control of the features available within the RAT.
These additional controls allow the RAT user to enable and disable features as needed.
Binary output can be also be generated in multiple formats, such as .exe, .src and .dll.

Syrian Malware Team
We observed activity from the Syrian Malware Team going as far back as Jan. 1, 2011.
Based on Facebook posts, they are allegedly directly or indirectly involved with the Syrian
government. Their Facebook page shows they are still very active, with a post as recent as
July 16th, 2014.

Syrian Malware Team’s Facebook page
The Syrian Malware Team has been involved in everything from profiling targets to
orchestrating attacks themselves. There are seemingly multiple members, including:
https://www.facebook.com/hawk.syrian.9
https://www.facebook.com/kays.syr
Partial list of self-proclaimed Syrian Malware Team members
Some of these people have posted malware-related items on Facebook.

While looking for Dark Edition samples, we discovered a binary named svchost.exe (MD5:
015c51e11e314ff99b1487d92a1ba09b). We quickly saw indicators that it was created by
BlackWorm Dark Edition.

Configuration options within code
The malware communicated out to 178.44.115.196, over port 5050, with a command
structure of:

7/9

!0/j|n\12121212_64F3BF1F/j|n\{Hostname}/j|n\{Username}/j|n\USA/j|n\Win 7 Professional
SP1 x86/j|n\No/j|n\2.4.0 [ Dark Edition]/j|n\/j|n\{ActiveWindowName}/j|n\[endof]
When looking at samples of Dark Edition BlackWorm being used by the Syrian Malware
Team, the strings “Syrian Malware,” or “Syrian Malware Team” are often used in the C2
communications or within the binary strings.
Additional pivoting off of svchost.exe brought us to three additional samples apparently built
with BlackWorm Dark Edition. E.exe, (MD5: a8cf815c3800202d448d035300985dc7) a binary
that drew our attention, looked to be a backdoor with the Syrian Malware strings within it.

When executed, the binary beacons to aliallosh.sytes.net on port 1177. This C2 has been
seen in multiple malware runs often associated with Syria. The command structure of the
binary is:
!0/j|n\Syrian Malware/j|n\{Hostname}/j|n\{Username}/j|n\USA/j|n\Win 7 Professional SP1
x86/j|n\No/j|n
\0.1/j|n\/j|n\{ActiveWindowName}/j|n\[endof]
Finally, pivoting to another sample, 1gpj.srcRania
(MD5:f99c15c62a5d981ffac5fdb611e13095), the same strings were present. The string
"Rania" used as a lure was in Arabic and likely refers to the prolific Queen Rania of Jordan.

The traffic is nearly identical to the other samples we identified and tied to the Syrian
Malware Team.

Conclusion
Determining which groups use which malware is often very difficult. Connecting the dots
between actors and malware typically involves looking at binary code, identifying related
malware examples associated with those binaries, and reviewing infection vectors, among
other things.
This blog presents a prime example of the process of attribution. We connected a builder
with malware samples and the actors/developers behind these attacks. This type of
attribution is key to creating actionable threat intelligence to help proactively protect
organizations.
