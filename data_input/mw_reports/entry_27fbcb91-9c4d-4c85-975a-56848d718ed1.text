After analyzing code from a command and control (C2) server used in the global cyberespionage campaign dubbed 'Sharpshooter', security researchers found more evidence
linking it to North Korea's Lazarus threat actor.
The assessment was possible with the help of a government entity and revealed that the
operation is broader in scope, more complex and older than initially thought.

The North Korean connection
To hide their true location, the threat actor used the ExpressVPN service that showed
connections to the web shell (Notice.php) on a compromised server coming from two IP
addresses in London.

However, the IP addresses are rarely a reliable indicator of the attacker's origin or for
attribution. The connection to the Lazarus group was obvious by inspecting the tools,
strategies, and methods already linked to the North Korean actor.
For instance, Rising Sun was observed in attacks before the discovery of 'Sharpshooter' and
shared the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) seen in operations attributed to
Lazarus group.
The three variants of the backdoor (v1.0, v1.1, and v2.0) indicate a clear evolution from
Duuzer, used by Lazarus, as they all include its core capabilities.

"These [Rising Sun] implants were all based on the original Backdoor Duuzer source code,"
the researchers say in their report.
The high similarity of the fake job recruitment campaigns both groups used to disguise their
attacks, and the fact that Lazarus relied on similar versions of Rising Sun in activity tracked
in 2017, point to a connection between the two adversaries.

Analyzing the code and data from the C2, Ryan Sherstobitoff and Asheer Malhotra from
McAfee, along with the company's Advanced Threat Research Team (ATR), discovered new
variants of the Rising Sun backdoor that were used since at least 2016.
"The server was used to distribute and infect victims with an upgraded version of Rising Sun
with SSL capabilities," informs a report shared with BleepingComputer.
The rare opportunity to examine Sharpshooter's backend operations allowed the researchers
to create a fuller picture of the activity and interaction between the various tools used by the
threat actor.

Local recreation of Sharpshooter's C2 main panel
Getting access to the C2 information helped the researchers get a clear view of the
attacker's operations and utilities. It also provided sufficient details to quickly improve
detection of malicious activity from this threat by uncovering new tools otherwise hidden by
obfuscation techniques.
An alternative method for discovering them is by analyzing network packets, which is more
difficult and requires more time.

Another finding in the activity of 'Sharpshooter' were a set of unobfuscated connections from
IP addresses in Windhoek, a city in Namibia, Africa. One explanation for this could be
that that they used the region as a test zone; another would be that the threat actor runs the
operation from those locations, although it could also be a false flag meant to point the
researchers on the wrong path.
When 'Sharpshooter' was first discovered, it was believed that the operation started in
October 2018. However, a log file on the server indicates that the C2 framework has been
active since at least September 2017, and probably "hosted on different servers over time."
The threat actor first detected towards the end of last year when it attacked at least 87
organizations around the world in two months' time. Its activity is ongoing.
McAfee researchers will present their findings at this year's RSA security conference in San
Francisco.
