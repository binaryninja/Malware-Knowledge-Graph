Scan mode
The Scan mode enumerates software and services via WMI, WinRM, Remote Registry, and
Remote Services.
It then checks for the existence of the following security programs:

Finally, it checks for the existence of the following programs:
Hitachi Storage Navigator Modular
.NET

PowerPoint
The malware then saves all the information in CSV files and, using WinRAR, compresses
them to a file named export.zip.
List of CSV files compressed by Grixba:
alive.csv
wm.csv
soft.csv
all_soft.csv
mount.csv
users.csv
remote_svc.csv
cached_RDP.csv
Scanall mode
Scanall mode is similar to Scan mode, but scans for a broader list of programs.
Clr mode
Clr mode deletes the logs from local and remote computers. It also enumerates the following
registry keys:
SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\eventlog
SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\WINEVT\\Channels
It uses the APIs "EvtOpenLog" and "EvtClearLog" to delete the logs and deletes the WMI
activity logs from the event source "Microsoft-Windows-WMI-Activity".

VSS Copying Tool
The Play ransomware gang was also recently observed using another .NET executable,
which was also developed with the Costura tool.

5/7

Costura embeds the library AlphaVSS into executables. The AlphaVSS library is a.NET
framework that provides a high-level interface for interacting with VSS. The library makes it
easier for .NET programs to interface with VSS by offering a set of controlled APIs.
Developers can use these APIs to generate, manage, and delete shadow copies, as well as
access information about existing shadow copies such as size and status.
The tool created by the Play ransomware operators uses AlphaVSS to copy files from VSS
snapshots. The tool enumerates the files and folders in a VSS snapshot and copies them to
a destination directory. The tool allows the attackers to copy files from VSS volumes on
compromised machines prior to encryption. This allows the threat actors to copy files that
would normally be locked by the operating system.

Play Ransomware Background
Play ransomware (also known as PlayCrypt), which is developed by a group Symantec
tracks as Balloonfly, was launched in June 2022, and since then has been responsible for
multiple high-profile attacks. Like most ransomware groups now, Play carries out doubleextortion attacks, where the attackers exfiltrate data from victim networks before encrypting
them. While the ransomware gang had an initial focus on organizations in Latin America,
especially Brazil, it soon widened its targeting.
Play is known for targeting Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-41080, CVE-202241082), as well as other flaws, to gain remote code execution (RCE) and infiltrate victim
networks. The group was also one of the first ransomware groups to employ intermittent
encryption, a technique that allows for faster encryption of victims’ systems. The tactic
consists of encrypting only parts of the targeted files' content, which would still render the
data unrecoverable.
Play is also notable as it doesn’t appear to operate as a ransomware-as-a-service, with
Balloonfly seemingly carrying out the ransomware attacks as well as developing the
malware.

Use of Custom Tools on the Rise
Custom tools are increasingly being used by ransomware gangs in their attacks. This is likely
due to a number of reasons, such as making attacks more efficient and reducing dwell time.
Custom tools can be tailored to a specific target environment, allowing ransomware gangs to
carry out attacks faster and more efficiently. The use of proprietary tools also gives
ransomware operators more control over their operations. If a tool is widely available, it can
be reverse-engineered or adapted by other attackers, potentially weakening the initial
attack's effectiveness. By keeping their tools proprietary and exclusive, ransomware gangs
can maintain their competitive advantage and maximize their profits.
