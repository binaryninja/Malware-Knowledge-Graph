In this blog entry, we share the findings of an investigation on the internet of things (IoT)
Linux malware and analyzed how these malware families have been evolving. We relied on
the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of MITRE ATT&CKto define the malware
capabilities and characteristics that we saw.
Our study showed that IoT Linux malware has been steadily evolving, particularly those that
are used to create IoT botnets. Capabilities were both added and removed over time.
Notably, neither data exfiltration nor lateral movement has been successful for the authors,
and they have pivoted instead to centralized infection.
Table 1 shows the 10 most implemented capabilities (or techniques) in our malware data set.

Methodology
The results presented in this entry are the outcome of a methodology that takes advantage
of the power of the MITRE ATT&CK framework to characterize the capabilities of IoT Linux
malware. The ATT&CK framework allowed us to describe threats in a structured way and to
have an implementation-independent representation that let us compare malware
capabilities. The capabilities were extracted by using both static and dynamic analysis, after
which we mapped them into the ATT&CK Techniques, Tactics, and Procedures (TTPs).
The methodology is comprised of four steps:
1. Malware collection. We selected malware discovered between January 2019 and
August 2021.
2. Malware analysis. We employed both static (Ghidra, IDA Pro) and dynamic analysis
(strace, ltrace, GDB) to discover malware capabilities. We looked for all aspects of
each malware sample including the pre and post exploitation steps, such as initial
access vector, lateral movement, and impact.
3. Mapping. We mapped the malware capabilities to MITRE ATT&CK TTPs.
4. Analysis. We analyzed the mapped TTPs to retrieve changes and similarities in our
malware set.
Figure 1 illustrates the steps used in this methodology.

New IoT botnet techniques
During the observation period, we noted four new techniques added to threat actors’
arsenals. One is a newly implemented technique in botnet families called Masquerading:
Match Legitimate Name or Location (T1036.005). It is a Defense Evasion technique that
likely reflect the manufacturers’ increasing interest and efforts in securing these IoT devices
or appliances. The technique involves adversaries trying to match the name and location of
legitimate and trusted programs to hide malicious executables and evade detection.
Another new technique that diverges from the more common technique being used in IoT
Linux malware (Indicator Removal on Host: File Deletion (T1070.004) is File and Directory
Permissions Modification: Linux and Mac File and Directory Permissions Modification
(T1222.002) introduced in a malware discovered in mid-2020. We observed these additions
especially in the Dark Nexus malware. Most of the platforms provide two primary commands
used to manipulate file and directory ACLs: chown (change owner) and chmod (change
mode).
Furthermore, among the 2021 discovered families, is a variant of StealthWorker GO, a
malware written in the Golang language, where we observed the addition of the Scheduled
Task/Job: Cron (T1053.003) technique. This is an execution tactic which also allows malware
to achieve persistence in the system. This software utility maintains persistence in the
system by enabling an attacker to achieve time-based command execution.
Dropped techniques
On the other hand, we found three techniques relating to the lateral movement tactic to have
been dropped. We observed a trend in recently discovered families that gives the
responsibility for propagation back to the C&C server. In the Dark Nexus family, for example,
3/6

we found that it is the C&C server that takes steps to propagate the malware. Our analysis
highlighted the drop of two techniques linked to the Lateral Movement tactic, which are
Remote Services (T1021) and Exploitation of Remote Services (T1210). In relation to this,
the technique for the discovery of network information, System Network Configuration
Discovery (T1016), is also no longer enforced.
Uncommon techniques
Additionally, we noticed that IoT Linux malware authors are not interested in stealing data. In
our data set, there is only one malware (QSnatch) that implements typical tactics for data
leakages, such as collection and exfiltration. Moreover, we also found that privilege
escalation is not among the interests of IoT malware authors. It is likely because, from a
malware author’s standpoint, the benefits of executing malware that require higher privileges
are not worth the effort of implementation. Furthermore, the default accounts on targeted
devices usually already come with all the privileges needed to run programs, write to the
filesystem, and establish new connections.
Differences between ransomware and botnet malware
The characterization through the ATT&CK matrix also allowed us to compare different
malware classes that target IoT devices which in our data set are ransomware and botnet
families.
The findings highlight some common techniques, such as the Credential Access
methodology where Brute Force: Password Guessing (T1110.001) is the most common
technique that both malware classes fall under. This finding is not a surprise since it is
common to find default usernames and passwords still being used in these kinds of devices.
Usually, users are not aware of the risks of exposing IoT devices to the internet. Indeed,
many devices are still installed without changing the default credentials or securing remote
access.
Another common capability for both classes is External Remote Services (T1133) from the
Initial Access Tactic, which confirms unsecured and exposed internet services, such as
Telnet and SSH. This technique allows attackers to exploit external-facing remote services to
initially access and/or persist within a network; they also often use exposed services that do
not require authentication.
Another similarity is in the two classes’ Command and Control implementation, as both
implement Application Layer Protocol: Web protocol (T1071.001). This is likely because the
market for malware-as-a-service is growing. Thus, having a simple UI that the “customers” or
other threat actors can use to control the malware is an important aspect.
By comparing the number of unique TTPs implemented, we studied the implementation
variations among different malware families and noticed that while different ransomware
families share many common techniques, botnets tend to innovate more and implement a
4/6

variety of different TTPs to exploit many services. This may be because detection of botnet
malware is more mature, so they require more frequent changes to avoid being easily
detected. These differences are illustrated in Figure 2.

Conclusion
As the number of connected devices grow, linked threats also increase. Knowing the
evolution of malware that targets IoT devices is fundamental to implementing effective
countermeasures and defenses.
We saw how IoT malware has been slowly developing over the years. Botnet threats, in
particular, is an active field where capabilities are being added and removed, reflecting not
only the behavior of threat actors but also the defenses being implemented in these devices.
The MITRE ATT&CK framework helps create a standardized way of listing down techniques
and characterizing threats found today. It is easy to see how the awareness of common
TTPs can help organizations and users better protect their devices and networks. For
example, our findings further stress the importance of changing default passwords in all
connected devices.
Organizations and users can also consider these steps to secure their devices:
Manage vulnerabilities and apply patches as soon as possible. Applying patches as
soon as they are released can reduce the chances for potential exploits.
Use secure configurations. A secure device configuration narrows openings for
compromise or remote attacks.
5/6

Use strong, hard-to-guess passwords. Aside from changing default passwords, users
can circumvent brute force techniques by using strong passwords and enabling twofactor authentication if it is an option.
IoT
In our study, we relied on the tactics, techniques, and procedures of MITRE ATT&CK to
define the malware capabilities and characteristics of IoT Linux malware. We describe our
findings and how IoT malware has been evolving.
