TA2552 Uses OAuth Access Token Phishing to Exploit Read-Only Risks

2/14

September 29, 2020 The Proofpoint Threat Research Team
Since January 2020, Proofpoint researchers have tracked an actor
abusing Microsoft Office 365 (O365) third-party application (3PA) access, with suspected
activity dating back to August 2019. The actor, known as TA2552, uses wellcrafted Spanish language lures that leverage a narrow range of themes and brands. The
lures entice users to click a link in the message, taking them to the legitimate Microsoft thirdparty apps consent page. There they are prompted to grant a third-party application readonly user permissions to their O365 account via OAuth2 or other token-based authorization
methods. TA2552 seeks access to specific account resources like the user’s
contacts and mail. Requesting read-only permissions for such account resources could be
used to conduct account reconnaissance, silently steal data, or to intercept password reset
messages from other accounts such as those at financial institutions. While organizations with
global presence have received messages from this group, they appear to choose recipients
who are likely Spanish speakers.

Attack Technique Overview
The campaigns from TA2552 follow a similar attack flow. Upon clicking the link in the
message, the recipient is redirected to the authentic Microsoft third-party application consent
page at login.microsoftonline.com and asked to grant or deny the requested permissions. If
the browser is not already authenticated to O365, the user is prompted to authenticate. If
consent is granted, the third-party application will be allowed to access the currently
authenticated O365 account. The list of permissions we have observed in these
campaigns allows read-only access to items such as the user's contacts, profile, and
mail. Even if consent is denied, the browser is still redirected to an attacker-controlled
page, giving the actor the opportunity to present more attack techniques to the visitor.

Figure 2: Relevant components of a consent URL
Through some campaigns, we have observed the same phish URLs leading to consent URLs
with different values for client_id, redirect_uri, and scope options. Some campaigns have used
multiple phish URLs. Samples listed below should not be considered representative of the
complete list of 3PA IDs and URLs used by this actor over time.

Message Overview
In addition to the lures, there are several important components to the
attacks described below. Below each message sample, we’ve included several relevant
attributes:
OAuth Access Token Phish Lure Theme: Branding or entity being impersonated.
OAuth Access Token Phish URL Sample: Sample of the URL linked in the message
body.
ClientID Sample: Sample of the observed client_id value from consent URLs.
Consent redirect URL Sample: A sample of the redirect_uri value from observed
consent URLs where the user’s browser is sent post-consent, regardless of the user’s
choice to consent or not. The request may contain an authorization code if the user
chooses to consent, or an error code if the consent request was denied.
Scope values observed in consent URL: A sample of the scope value from the
consent URL. It describes the permissions requested by the third-party application
Impersonation of the Servicio de Administración Tributaria (SAT), Mexico’s tax authority, is a
common message theme for this actor. When SAT is used in the phish lure, the email
suggests that the recipient needs to update their contact information and is presented with
what appears to be a link to do so (Figures 3, 4). Some subjects, like
“Аcսse dе Сіta - Aсlaracіоոes 2020. (Acknowledgment of Appointment – Clarifications
2020.),” make use of non-ASCII characters, possibly to evade simple spam filters (Figure 3).

Mexican tax- and government-themed messages are regularly observed with this actor,
though they have occasionally deviated from this messaging and impersonated popular
consumer brands. In July, we observed this actor’s lures impersonating Netflix Mexico (Figure
5) and Amazon Prime Mexico (Figures 6, 7).

Third-Party Applications and Permission Risks
It’s important to understand the scope and risk of permissions requested by the third-party
apps linked in these messages. The official consent page presents a list of permissions
requested by the third-party application (Figure 8 is an example).

Figure 8: Itemized permission list for a third-party application
All permissions we’ve observed requested thus far have been read-only. While that might
seem relatively benign, even allowing an actor read access to a user’s inbox and contacts can
have significant regulatory and privacy consequences. The minimal permissions requested by
these apps also likely help them appear
inconspicuous if an organization’s O365 administrator audits connected apps for their
users’ accounts. The apps don’t request many permissions, and those they do might not
appear particularly far-reaching, allowing them to blend in with other benign apps.

Contacts.Read and People.Read could be used for email address harvesting. Obtaining
email addresses in this way can help ensure addresses are valid and active.

12/14

User.Read can help an actor determine potential value of an account, or the value of
compromising the user’s other accounts.
Mail.Read allows an actor to read a user’s mail, potentially offering a more subtle
manner of collecting credentials. If an actor completes the ‘forgot password’ flow on a
site connected to the email address and a password reset link is sent via email, they
could effectively steal the account. This also assumes that the user’s account does not
have multifactor authentication measures independent of the readable account’s
inbox enabled.

Infrastructure and Hosting
The phish URL in the lure is usually a compromised site that takes the recipient to
the official O365 login page if they’re not authenticated. Once signed into their O365 account,
the user is redirected to the official O365 consent process that prompts them to grant
permissions to the actor’s application. The domains that catch the OAuth tokens are often
registered via Namecheap and hosted on Cloudflare.

Conclusion
Threat actors often find creative ways to harvest information. In these attacks, TA2552 doesn't
rely on techniques like more traditional credential phishing or dropping malware on a
system. Instead, they gain permissions to view the content and activity of resources available
through a user’s O365 account. The departure from such traditional techniques gives this
actor an advantage, as users likely aren’t trained to spot or inspect suspicious
applications. Even read-only access comes with considerable risk. The ability to perform
reconnaissance on an O365 account supplies an actor with valuable information that can later
be weaponized in business email compromise (BEC) attacks or account takeovers.
