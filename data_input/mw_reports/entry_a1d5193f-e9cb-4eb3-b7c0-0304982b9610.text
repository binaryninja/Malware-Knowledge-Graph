XLoader Android Spyware and Banking Trojan
Distributed via DNS Spoofing

April 20, 2018

We have been detecting a new wave of network attacks since early March, which, for now,
are targeting Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. The attacks use Domain Name
System (DNS) cache poisoning/DNS spoofing, possibly through infringement techniques
such as brute-force or dictionary attacks, to distribute and install malicious Android apps.
Trend Micro detects these as ANDROIDOS_XLOADER.HRX.
These malware pose as legitimate Facebook or Chrome applications. They are distributed
from polluted DNS domains that send a notification to an unknowing victim’s device. The
malicious apps can steal personally identifiable and financial data and install additional apps.
XLoader can also hijack the infected device (i.e., send SMSs) and sports selfprotection/persistence mechanisms through device administrator privileges.

Infection Chain
As with our earlier reports in late March, the attack chain involves diverting internet traffic to
attacker-specified domains by compromising and overwriting the router’s DNS settings. A
fake alert will notify and urge the user to access the malicious domain and download
XLoader.

Technical Analysis
XLoader first loads the encrypted payload from Assets/db as test.dex to drop the necessary
modules then requests for device administrator privileges. Once granted permission, it hides
its icon from the launcher application list then starts a service that it keeps running in the
background. The background service uses the reflection technique (a feature that allows the
inspection and modification of Java-based programs’ internal properties) to invoke the
method com.Loader.start in the payload.

technique
Monitoring Broadcast Events
XLoader registers many broadcast receivers in the payload dynamically (to monitor
broadcast events sent between system and applications). Registering broadcast receivers
enable XLoader to trigger its malicious routines. Here is a list of broadcast actions:
android.provider.Telephony.SMS_RECEIVED
android.net.conn.CONNECTIVITY_CHANGE
android.intent.action.BATTERY_CHANGED
android.intent.action.USER_PRESENT
android.intent.action.PHONE_STATE
android.net.wifi.SCAN_RESULTS
android.intent.action.PACKAGE_ADDED
android.intent.action.PACKAGE_REMOVED
android.intent.action.SCREEN_OFF
android.intent.action.SCREEN_ON
android.media.RINGER_MODE_CHANGED
android.sms.msg.action.SMS_SEND
android.sms.msg.action.SMS_DELIVERED
Creating a Web Server to Phish

5/12

XLoader creates a provisional web server to receive the broadcast events. It can also create
a simple HTTP server on the infected device to deceive victims. It shows a web phishing
page whenever the affected device receives a broadcast event (i.e., if a new package is
installed or if the device’s screen is on) to steal personal data, such as those keyed in for
banking apps. The phishing page is translated in Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and English,
which are hardcoded in the payload. It will appear differently to users depending on the
language set on the device.

XLoader can also collect information related to usage of apps installed in the device. Its datastealing capabilities include collecting SMSs after receiving an SMS-related broadcast event
and covertly recording phone calls. XLoader can also hijack accounts linked to financial or
game-related apps installed on the affected device.

XLoader can also start other attacker-specified packages. A possible attack scenario
involves replacing legitimate apps with repackaged or malicious versions. By monitoring the
package installation broadcast event, XLoader can start their packages. This enables it to
launch malicious apps without the user’s awareness and explicit consent.
We reverse engineered XLoader and found that it appears to target South Korea-based
banks and game development companies. XLoader also prevents victims from accessing the
device’s settings or using a known antivirus (AV) app in the country.
XLoader can also load multiple malicious modules to receive and execute commands from
its remote command-and-control (C&C) server, as shown below:

Here’s a list of the modules and their functions:
sendSms — send SMS/MMS to a specified address
setWifi — enable or disable Wi-Fi connection
gcont — collect all the device’s contacts
lock — currently just an input lock status in the settings (pref) file, but may be used as a
screenlocking ransomware
bc — collect all contacts from the Android device and SIM card
setForward — currently not implemented, but can be used to hijack the infected device
getForward — currently not implemented, but can be used to hijack the infected device
hasPkg — check the device whether a specified app is installed or not
setRingerMode — set the device’s ringer mode
setRecEnable — set the device’s ringer mode as silent
reqState — get a detailed phone connection status, which includes activated network
and Wi-Fi (with or without password)
showHome — force the device’s back to the home screen
getnpki: get files/content from the folder named NPKI (contains certificates related to
financial transactions)
http — access a specified network using HttpURLConnection
onRecordAction — simulate a number-dialed tone
call — call a specified number
get_apps — get all the apps installed on the device

show_fs_float_window — show a full-screen window for phishing
Of note is XLoader’s abuse of the WebSocket protocol (supported in many browsers and
web applications) via ws(WebSockets) or wss(WebSockets over SSL/TLS) to communicate
with its C&C servers. The URLs — abused as part of XLoader’s C&C — are hidden in three
webpages, and the C&C server that XLoader connects to differ per region.
The abuse of the WebSocket protocol provides XLoader with a persistent connection
between clients and servers where data can be transported any time. XLoader abuses the
MessagePack (a data interchange format) to package the stolen data and exfiltrate it via the
WebSocket protocol for faster and more efficient transmission.

Mitigations
XLoader will not download malicious apps if the Android device uses a mobile data
connection. Nevertheless, users should practice proper security hygiene to mitigate threats
that may take advantage of a home or business router’s security gaps. Employ stronger
credentials, for instance, to make them less susceptible to unauthorized access. Regularly
update and patch the router’s software and firmware to prevent exploits, and enable its builtin firewall.
For system administrators and information security professionals, configuring the router to be
more resistant to attacks like DNS cache poisoning can help mitigate similar threats.
Everyday users can do the same by checking the router’s DNS settings if they’ve been
modified. Even threats like DNS cache poisoning employ social engineering, so users should
also be more prudent against suspicious or unknown messages that have telltale signs of
malware.
We have worked with Google and they ensure that Google Play Protect proactively catches
apps of this nature. No instances of these apps were found in Google Play.
