DUCKTAIL is the name given to a malware operation that was previously focused on
targeting individuals and organizations that operate on Facebook’s Business Ads
platform
The initial infection starts with a malicious LNK that executes PowerShell to download
malware hosted on a public file-sharing service
The DUCKTAIL operation has changed their custom malware to be compiled as a .NET
Core 5
The final payload has been changed from custom-made malware to commodity
malware during the experimental phase
WithSecure reported on the DUCKTAIL operation in two separate reports in 2022 (1, 2).
Shortly after the first publication, which carefully detailed their TTPs, the threat operation
went silent.
After the publication revealed their tactics for a second time, they again went silent. It was at
this time that Deep Instinct observed the operation experimenting with changing the initial
infection from an archive containing a malicious executable to an archive containing a
malicious LNK file that would start the infection chain (we’ll describe this below).
Deep Instinct observed the operation becoming operational again at the beginning of
February 2023.

Initial Experiments Observed by Deep Instinct
In October 2022 the DUCKTAIL operation was observed by the Threat Reseach team at
Deep Instinct pushing their custom .NET malware in their usual infection chain, as was
described by WithSecure in the previously mentioned reports.
The payload with the hash 27c76c08e4d3a17056e0d22cbe1f6e59 was signed by a nowrevoked certificate for a fake business created by the threat actor:

The payload was inside an archive (870dc03ba3120e4ecfb799b519ec1a50) with decoy
images and videos:

As described by WithSecure, the malware exfiltrated data via a Telegram bot, in this case via
an HTTP request to: hxxps://api.telegram.org/bot5448616453:AAHJdBSZdnpmhl5_xYzf0uLclkJzggXCSw/sendMessage
The exact same payload was observed in parallel in another infection chain that Deep
Instinct determined was used for testing purposes to bypass detections and improve the
number of successful infections.
While the final payload is the same, the new alternative infection chain began with an archive
(ece3728e2893c9dd70fb519ac80070b6) containing only an LNK file without any decoy files.
The LNK file is calling PowerShell to download and execute another PowerShell script which
is hosted on Discord:

The PowerShell command inside the LNK is lightly obfuscated using simple tricks like adding
quotes, concatenation, and string replace which are used to bypass static detections.

The downloaded 2nd-stage PowerShell (238fbb5ac0af956e8d07cf0f716e0d83) is also lightly
obfuscated using the same replace trick plus a custom function for download and execution
which should bypass some static detections.
When executed, the 2nd-stage PowerShell downloads the exact same signed payload
(27c76c08e4d3a17056e0d22cbe1f6e59) which has been observed in the old infection chain.
Additionally, a benign archive file with decoy files is also downloaded. Both files are hosted
on Discord. Finally, the 2nd-stage PowerShell deletes the initial LNK file to cover its tracks:

Deep Instinct Observes More DUCKTAIL Experiments:
From November to December 2022 the DUCKTAIL operation seemed to have switched
solely to the LNK infection chain while continuing to experiment with it. We observed the
following experiments:
Inflation of LNK files:
The LNK file (5da77aeb1d6ec4d7c9b8408cab3feecc) has a size of almost 300 MB.
While the functionality is the same as the previous LNK file, this file has zero bytes appended
to it. This technique is growing in popularity among threat actors because of file-size limits at
various vendors and sandboxes.
Change to initial PowerShell command inside LNK:
The initial PowerShell script inside the LNK files has been completely changed to heavily rely
on concatenation with the combination of extracting a single character from the “$PSHOME”
variable.
The “$PSHOME” in PowerShell translates to the directory where “powershell.exe” is located,
for example
“C:\WINDOWS\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\.”

Below is an example of an extracted and edited version of a new LNK
(e03635ef5c57b4884f619108499971e4):

Changes to public hosting storage:
At first, the DUCKTAIL operation used Discord to host the next stages of the attack. At some
point the operation shifted to other public storage providers such as “transfer.sh,” GitHub,
and Google Drive.
Additionally, the use of dedicated attacker-controlled domains were observed (see
appendix).
One such example is the domain “techhint24[.]com” which is shown in figure 5.
Previously, WithSecure observed archives with the malicious executable hosted at Dropbox,
iCloud, and MediaFire. In addition, Deep Instinct observed the current archives with LNK
hosted at attacker-controlled domains and in free subdomains that would redirect to
DropBox, such as status-refund-taxes[.]web[.]app which been observed by
@JAMESWT_MHT:

Figure 6: Redirect to download file from DropBox found at “status-refund-taxes[.]web[.]app”
Changes to final payload:
During infection chain experiments the threat actor used their own custom .NET malware,
likely due to the revocation of their certificate and the growing detection rate for the malware.
At some point the operation switched to different payloads.
In the example shown in figure 7, the payload was Doenerium stealer. In other instances,
Vidar stealer was observed. This change might indicate that threat actor is exploring new
ways to monetize their attacks.

Back to Action – New wave of attack in February 2023:
After doing the experiments at the end of 2022, there was no sign of new activity in 2023
until the middle of February.
The operation is back with an infection chain that combines all the features in the
experiments, while the final payload is once again the custom malware with yet another new
valid certificate:

information.
The actor made an OpSec mistake and added the email address of a domain that was
registered by him at cakoithaivuong[.]site.
In addition to the new LNK infection chain, the old infection chain consisting of archives
containing malicious executables and decoy files is also active.
In this wave, the custom DUCKTAIL malware functionality remains the same but is being
distributed as a 64bit .NET Core 5 binary:

In case you missed the previous reports on DUCKTAIL, the purpose of the malware is to
steal browser cookies and exfiltrate them through Telegram. If a Facebook session cookie is
found, the malware checks if the Facebook account is a business account. If it is, the
malware tries to add the attacker’s email as an admin and finance editor.
Below is a scheme showing the new DUCKTAIL infection chain:

Additional Information:
Delivery mechanism:
WithSecure initially observed that individuals have been targeted via LinkedIn. During our
research, we have identified two threads in Reddit (1, 2) which discuss a suspicious LNK file
that is spread via link to an archive hosted on Google drive. The link is added to various
threads on Reddit as can be seen in archived version of one of those posts.
Monetization:
While WithSecure detailed the malware functionality which specifically targets the Facebook
Ads platform there is a missing piece on what the threat actor does once they gain access to
business Facebook Ads accounts.
While it might be possible to get the credit card information that is used for paying for ads in
the compromised accounts this doesn’t seem plausible. There are far better, cheaper, and
easier ways to gain credit card information.
One of the initial samples (138831ebee49d667748c4babe5ea2445) has been inside an
archive (7e8f1c84347586e8b9b62d7493c6017c). This archive has been hosted on the
domain aicokgroup[.]com.
We have identified the following Facebook page that lists this domain as their homepage:

Figure 10: Facebook page with aicokgroup[.]com
One of the posts has an Amazon short URL which is no longer active. An archived version
shows that the link is for AICOK Juicer machine:

Figure 11: Amazon item from link in Facebook group.
While we are not sure whether AICOK is a real company or a shell company made by the
threat actor, their items seem to be “white label” products. For example, the same juicer is
listed now as another brand on Amazon:

8/15

Figure 12: Amazon listing for same item but a different brand.
On the same Facebook page there is another post which is a job ad for a Facebook Ads
Manager:

Figure 13: Facebook post for Facebook Ads Manager.
While investigating the AICOK lead, we came across another Facebook page which is
related to AICOK with a nearly identical post. The only difference is that this page had a
different domain:

10/15

Figure 14: Another Facebook post for Facebook Ads Manager. Comment mentions this is a
virus.
The second domain, aicok[.]cc, no longer exists. However, there is a similar domain
(aicook[.]cc) which redirects to aicookhome[.]com. We have found another Facebook page
which contains those domains:

11/15

Figure 15: Facebook page of AICOOK
The page mentions that there were scams on Facebook for their brand “AICOOK,” while the
DUCKTAIL Facebook pages are called “AICOK.”
Since we have only identified one such instance, we can’t assess exactly whether this is a
one-time event or whether this is the usual operational method of DUCKTAIL.
There could a couple theories for what could be happening:
1. Pure scam – AICOK was imitating AICOOK. DUCKTAIL would buy Ads for “AICOK”
and unsuspecting victims would order items and never receive them. In addition, the
fake shop would look for Ad Managers while infecting them with malware.

12/15

2. Drop shipping / Affiliate program / White-label sale – AICOOK has an affiliate program.
DUCKTAIL have pushed ads from stolen Facebook Ads accounts to promote the sale
of various items. As seen in figures 9 and 10, the AICOK item price is much higher,
although it is the same item. The reason for this could be that either they directly sold
the white-label item from the factory as the AICOK brand mimicking AICOOK, or they
did drop shipping for AICOOK items, buying them at the original price and selling at a
much higher price for profit. Or simply as an affiliate and gained revenue from every
item sold while maximizing the profit by pushing a lot of ads from compromised
Facebook Ads accounts.
