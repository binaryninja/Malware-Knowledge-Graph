their networks. This is – by far – the most serious information security incident
we have seen in Poland.
It has been a busy week in SOCs all over Polish

nancial sector. At least a few of

Polish 20-something commercial banks have already con rmed being victims of
a malware infection while others keep looking. Network tra

c to exotic

locations and encrypted executables nobody recognised on some servers were
the

rst signs of trouble. A little more than a week ago one of the banks

detected strange malware present in a few workstations. Having established
basic indicators of compromise managed to share that information with other
banks, who started asking their SIEMs for information. In some cases the
results came back positive.

Delivery
Preliminary investigation suggests that the starting point for the infection could
have been located on the webserver of Polish

nancial sector regulatory body,

Polish Financial Supervision Authority (www.knf.gov.pl). Due to a slight
modi cation of one of the local JS

les, an external JS

le was loaded, which

could have executed malicious payloads on selected targets. This would be really
ironic if the website of the key institution responsible for assuring proper
security level in the banking sector was used to attack it.

After successful exploitation malware was downloaded to the workstation,
where, once executed, connected to some foreign servers and could be used to
perform network reconnaissance, lateral movement and data ex ltration. At
least in some cases the attackers managed to gain control over key servers
within bank infrastructure.

Malware
While you can

nd some hashes at the end of this article, we gathered the

available information regarding the malware itself. While there might be some
elements borrowed from other similar tools and crimeware strategies, the
malware used in this attack has not been documented before. It uses some
commercial packers and multiple obfuscation methods, has multiple stages,
relies on encryption and at the moment of initial analysis was not recognised by
available AV solutions. The

nal payload has the functionality of a regular RAT.

Motivation
While we have no idea of attackers motivation, so far we have no knowledge of
any direct

nancial losses incurred by banks or their customers due to this

attack. What is more troubling, some of the victims were able to identify large
outgoing data transfers. So far they could not identify the contents of the data
as it was encrypted. Investigation continues to fully understand the scope of
losses.

Conclusions & IOCs
While this should not come as a surprise, this incident is the perfect example of
the statement “you are going to get infected”. Polish

nancial sector has some

of the best people and tools in terms of security and still it looks like the
attackers achieved their objectives without major hurdles in at least some cases.
On the good side – they were detected and once noti ed banks were able to
quickly identify infected machines and suspicious tra

c patterns. The whole

process lacked solid information sharing, but this is a problem know
everywhere.
We hope to continue investigating this incident and share with you more details
about the malware itself in the future. Meanwhile please

Guys, Polish, not polish.
