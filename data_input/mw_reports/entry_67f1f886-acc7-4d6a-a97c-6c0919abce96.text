Email Gateways Bypassed

By Jake Longden, Cofense Phishing Defense Center
Microsoft Power BI, a popular data-visualization tool, is designed to help users wrangle their
data in multiple and more human-friendly formats. As a recognizable application from a
commonly used and trusted vendor, Power BI is also a prime target for threat actors to spoof
and abuse it for phishing attacks.
The Cofense Phishing Defense Center (PDC) has observed a new phishing campaign that
harvests Microsoft credentials by impersonating Power BI emails.

Figure 1: Email Body
As seen in Figure 1, the email resembles a legitimate Microsoft notification. There are a
couple of reasons how this happens. Threat actors have become comfortable adapting
legitimate MS notifications in their phishing templates. We also observe them leveraging
stolen credentials to create a legitimate looking notification from a legitimate MS instance.
We see that the threat actor in this email used a common theme to try to get the recipient to
interact with the links – Weekly Sales Report.

Figure 2: Phishing Page
Once the user has clicked the link in the email, they are presented with a page seen in
Figure 2, designed to look like a legitimate Microsoft log-in page. The first indicator that
something’s not right with the page, beyond the missing standard imagery, is that the URL
doesn’t look anything close to what’s indicated in the email or associated with Microsoft
services.

Subsequent to the recipient providing their credentials, the final step of the attack is an error
message indicating that there was an issue with the account verification. This is another
Microsoft spoof the threat actor employed to distract the recipient from the fact that they have
not been redirected to the Power BI report they expected to see. This discourages the
recipient from suspecting that they have just given away their credentials.
Cofense continues to observe credential phishing as a major threat to organizations. This is
why it’s critical to condition users to identify and report suspicious messages to the security
operations team. This recipient was well-conditioned to identify something wasn’t adding up
with this email and landing page, and used Cofense Reporter to send this off to the Cofense
Phishing Defense Center. Cofense can help you, too. Attacks such as this one are effective
at eluding common email security controls, and are – by design — overlooked by end users.
