Ransomware as a service (RaaS) can be credited as one of the primary reasons that
ransomware attacks are proliferating rapidly. Simply put, RaaS involves selling or renting
ransomware to buyers who are called affiliates.
In the past, ransomware attacks were mainly launched by the ransomware operators
themselves. When RaaS entered the picture, however, it made it easier for a variety of
attackers, even those who have little technical knowledge, to wield ransomware against
targets.
Essentially, we observed an organized division of labor in groups using RaaS. As a result of
this development, the participants of the cybercrime ecosystem gain higher proficiency and
specialization with regard to specific tasks, with some focusing on penetrating networks and
others on running the ransomware or conducting ransom negotiation with victims.

Such specialization, coupled with refined extortion techniques and technical strategies,
makes modern ransomware a notorious threat. With the threat’s ever-growing reach, it was
predicted that ransomware attacks could cost billions in the next decade.

How RaaS operates: the underground as a breeding ground
While RaaS is based on the software-as-a-service (SaaS) model where software can be
accessed online on a subscription basis, it also continues to evolve in its own ways, and this
fully functional and independent ecosystem thrives in the underground with its key players.
Among these key players are the operators, or those who develop and peddle ransomware.
They are usually organized in a group and have designated roles such as leader,
developers, and infrastructure and system administrators. More advanced groups might also
have other roles, such as recruiters, penetration testers (aka pentesters), victim analysts,
and negotiators.
Some roles and tools might also be outsourced or acquired through affiliate programs. For
instance, some operators avail of access-as-a-service (AaaS), which can provide various
means of access to targeted organizations. Meanwhile, other groups could have strong
penetration testing teams but might also lack the necessary ransomware software. Such
penetration testing teams often participate as affiliates for RaaS and use affiliate program
ransomware tools and infrastructure when a target is compromised. Affiliates might belong to
organized gangs themselves or might operate independently.

Figure 1. Comparison of direct ransomware operations (left) and RaaS operators (right)
With regard to the RaaS operation model, the RaaS-operating criminal group first needs to
develop or acquire the ransomware software and infrastructure. They then proceed to recruit
affiliates through online forums, Telegram channels, or personal connections, with some
operators investing as much as US$1 million for recruitment efforts. Once enlisted, affiliates
can then launch their own attacks.
RaaS provides a win-win situation and a high payout for both operators and affiliates while
allowing higher specialization in dedicated tasks. Affiliates can earn payouts without having
to develop the ransomware themselves, while operators can directly make a profit from their
affiliates. The payouts are normally organized using a revenue model for RaaS
subscriptions. The possible revenue models besides subscription are one-time payments,
profit sharing, and affiliate marketing. With such business models, the ransomware operators
can fully focus on developing and improving their ransomware software and operations
without needing to spend resources on other tasks, such as compromising targets or
distributing the ransomware themselves. Instead, these tasks are delegated to the RaaS
affiliates.

The cost of operations and its impact on ransom demands

3/14

It goes without saying that there are operational expenses for any ransomware group. As a
ransomware group needs to spend money on tools, skilled personnel and monthly
operational costs, ransomware attacks can indeed be expensive. A group leader thus needs
to figure out how to cover the recurring cost of operation. In particular, the rental of network
infrastructure has its own cost, and many of the group members receive monthly salaries
that need to be paid even if the ransomware attack victims do not pay the ransom. A
successful payout from an attack is therefore necessary to cover the recurring operational
cost of keeping a ransomware group running.
The one-time purchases of tools naturally come with their own price tags. Ransomware
groups and network penetration teams often do not develop the exploitation tools themselves
but prefer to purchase tools for initial access into organizations from third-party software
vendors and underground market software developers who offer varying prices, either for onhand or customized tools.
For groups following RaaS models and services with double extortion techniques,
percentage payouts for kit sellers and RaaS partnership programs have risen, with some
allocating for a full set of operations personnel such as pentesters, victim analysts, and
negotiators, as advertised in ads in underground forums.

4/14

Figure 2. Job posts in underground forums for pentesters and programmers capable of
accessing enterprise networks and performing privilege escalation
Regardless of successful payouts, most of these personnel require payment for services,
whether such remuneration involves monthly salary or per-project
payments.Estimating average monthly costs (such as salaries, servers, virtual private server
rentals, service providers, tools, accesses, and infrastructure, among others), these groups
might spend at least US$100,000 upward to keep operations running. If these groups target
10 companies at a time but only one victim can pay, that single organization carries the brunt
of all the expenses that the groups make in addition to the profit they hope to have.
However, many organizations still refuse to pay ransom demands, either because of their
internal policies, government regulations, or the assistance of authorities. Ransomware
groups do not look kindly on these refusals for payment, and they find ways to retaliate
against these companies. For example, Mespinoza operators threaten companies who
refuse to pay, not just with the exposure of sensitive data but also with the threat of reporting
the victim’s illegal activities, such as tax fraud or evasion.

Avoiding certain targets
In the underground, ransomware operators also gradually developed a strategy for
determining which targets to avoid. For instance, while the US remains one of the top targets
for all kinds of malicious activities, some ransomware operators discuss avoiding the country.
In the wake of high-profile ransomware attacks, authorities have been paying heightened
attention to the threat. As a result, no-pay policies, government assistance to victims for
ransom negotiation, and techniques to recover paid ransom could cause ransomware groups
to have a harder time getting paid.

5/14

And while some groups have turned their attention to Asia, ransomware groups generally
avoid, for example, going after Taiwanese companies because of the strict anti-money
laundering policies that make it difficult to legally purchase cryptocurrency and keep
organizations from paying the demanded ransom.
Other factors that can keep threat actors from attacking a certain region are the operators’
patriotism, countries’ poverty levels, or geopolitical situations that targets are in. For such
locations that are struggling economically and politically, or for countries that operators feel a
sense of loyalty to, threat groups opt to use other monetization activities, such as the sale or
rental of compromised assets or the use of keyloggers for harvesting various credentials,
which later on can be sold individually or through a “cloud of logs.”

Recent updates on RaaS operations
This year, there were also momentary but noticeable changes in the underground. After
DarkSide’s attack on Colonial Pipeline, all topics related to ransomware were banned on
many underground forums. Operators shifted to discreet advertising in underground forums
for system administrators, pentesters, and other seemingly legitimate jobs without disclosing
the purpose behind these ads. When it is discovered that the individuals behind these post
are actually hiring for the purpose of operating ransomware, their accounts are banned.
Ransomware operators have also become more selective of their targets. We observed
discussions in public and private groups about being more careful when choosing potential
victims and specifically avoiding political and critical infrastructure as well as the healthcare
sector as targets.
Profit division has also changed. Profits used to be usually divided into 70% and 30% in
favor of the affiliate when ransom demands were between five to six figures. Now, groups
collecting up to seven figures allot a 20% “finder’s fee” for access, while lateral movement
and penetration testing are now done within the salaried group. This was the observed
behavior for groups like Nefilim. Based on growing popularity in forum discussions, hiring
more pentesters to become part of the salaried group and the continued professionalization
of AaaS might likely continue to keep more of the profit intact and inside the main group.
The latest attacks also provide insight into where this is all heading. Based on REvil (aka
Sodinokibi) and DarkSide’s previous attacks on Linux-based VMware ESXi servers and
network-attached storage (NAS), there is a likelihood that other RaaS groups will be
expanding their targets and attacks to non-Windows servers, targeting other operating
systems such as Linux CentOS, Linux RedHat, and other UNIX flavors, all of which are
Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) compliant.

Ransomware families used by RaaS operators and affiliates

6/14

Most modern ransomware families have adopted the RaaS model. In our midyear
cybersecurity report, we found the top 10 most detected ransomware families. Interestingly,
eight of these families have been used by RaaS operators and affiliates at some point. Some
families, such as Locky, Cerber, and GandCrab, have been used in previous instances of
RaaS operations, although these variants have not been actively employed for attacks
recently. Nevertheless, they are still being detected in affected systems:

Figure 3. First half of 2021 data for most detected ransomware families that have been
RaaS-operated at some point
Based on this list, here are some of the ransomware families used by RaaS operators and
affiliates to launch critical attacks this year:

7/14

REvil
Before suddenly disappearing, REvil consistently made headlines this year due to its highprofile attacks, including those launched on meat supplier JBS and IT company Kaseya. It’s
also the fourth overall most detected ransomware in our 2021 midyear data, with 2,119
detections. After disappearing for about two months, this group recently brought their
infrastructure back and demonstrated signs of renewed activities.
This year, REvil demanded huge ransoms: US$70 million for the Kaseya attack (said to be
record-breaking) and US$22.5 million (with US$11 million paid) for the JBS attack.

Figure 4. REvil affiliate recruitment in underground forums
Techniques
While most techniques used by ransomware gangs remain the same from our most recent
update, they also employed some new techniques, such as the following:
Download and execution
An attachment (such as a PDF file) of a malicious spam email drops Qakbot into the
system. The malware will then download additional components and the payload.
CVE-2021-30116, a zero-day vulnerability affecting the Kaseya VSA servers, was used
in the Kaseya supply-chain attack.
Discovery
Additional legitimate tools, namely AdFind, SharpSploit, BloodHound, and NBTScan,
are also observed to be employed for network discovery.

DarkSide

8/14

DarkSide has also been prominent in the news lately due to its attack on Colonial Pipeline.
The targeted company was coerced to pay US$5 million in ransom. DarkSide ranked
seventh with 830 detections in our midyear data on most detected ransomware families.
Operators have since claimed that they will shut down operations due to pressure from
authorities. However, as with the case of some ransomware families, they might just lie low
for a while before resurfacing, or come out with the threat’s successor.
Techniques
As discussed in our earlier report, some of the notable techniques utilized by DarkSide are
the following:
Reconnaissance
For this phase, DarkSide abuses various tools, namely PowerShell, Metasploit
Framework, Mimikatz, and BloodHound.
Lateral movement
For lateral movement, DarkSide aims to gain Domain Controller (DC) or Active
Directory access. This is used to harvest credentials, escalate privileges, and gather
valuable assets that will be exfiltrated.
The DC network is then used to deploy the ransomware to connected machines.

Nefilim
Nefilim is the ninth most detected ransomware for midyear 2021, with 692 detections.
Attackers that wield the ransomware variant set their sights on companies with billion-dollar
revenues.
Like most modern ransomware families, Nefilim also employs double extortion techniques.
Nefilim affiliates are said to be especially vicious when affected companies don’t succumb to
ransom demands, and they keep leaked data published for a long time.
Techniques
Nefilim makes use of a variety of techniques such as the following:
Initial access
Nefilim can gain initial access through exposed RDPs.
It can also use Citrix Application Delivery Controller vulnerability (aka CVE-201919781) to gain entry into a system.
Lateral movement and defense evasion

9/14

Nefilim is capable of lateral movement via tools such as PsExec or Windows
Management Instrumentation (WMI).
It performs defense evasion through the use of third-party tools like PC Hunter,
Process Hacker, and Revo Uninstaller.

LockBit
LockBit resurfaced in the middle of the year with LockBit 2.0, targeting more companies as
they employ double extortion techniques. Based on our findings, Chile, Italy, Taiwan, and the
UK are among the most affected countries. In a recent prominent attack, ransom demand
went up as high as US$50 million.
LockBit 2.0 claims to have one of the fastest encryption techniques among other
ransomware. It also shows similarities with prominent ransomware families, Ryuk and
Egregor.

Figure 4. LockBit affiliate recruitment in underground forums
Techniques
Some of the updated ransomware’s techniques are the following:
Exfiltration
Operators provide StealBit (detected by Trend Micro as
TrojanSpy.Win32.STEALBIT.YXBHM), a tool that can automatically exfiltrate data, to
their affiliates to help the latter harvest assets.
Defense evasion
To terminate processes and services, the following batch files are used:

10/14

delsvc.bat (detected by Trend Micro as Trojan.BAT.KILLPROC.D) makes crucial
processes (such as MySQL and QuickBooks) and services (such as Microsoft
Exchange) unavailable.
AV.bat (detected by Trend Micro as Trojan.BAT.KILLAV.WLDX) uninstalls the antivirus
program ESET.
LogDelete.bat (detected by Trend Micro as PUA.BAT.DHARMA.A) clears Windows
event logs. Defoff.bat (detected by Trend Micro as Trojan.BAT.KILLAV.WLDX) disables
Windows Defender features such as real-time monitoring.
Impact
Devices are automatically encrypted across Windows through the abuse of Active
Directory group policies.

Conti
Conti is probably one of the largest ransomware groups operating today. It is often said to be
the successor of the Ryuk ransomware, as the former shares some similarities with the latter.
For example, with regard to tactics, both Conti and Ryuk are distributed via Emotet, Trickbot,
and BazarLoader. In our midyear roundup report data, Conti was the tenth most detected
ransomware, as it amassed 610 detections.
Recently, the FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released an
alert notice with regard to a surge in Conti ransomware attacks. Conti penetration-testing
documents, which provide detailed information on the operators’ preferred techniques, were
also leaked.
Techniques
Some notable techniques of the Conti ransomware are as follows:
Initial access
Conti can use malspam to gain entry into the system.
It can also exploit known vulnerabilities for initial access.
Discovery, lateral movement, and persistence
Conti can use open-source and off-the-shelf commercial tools, such as
PowerSploit, Metasploit, ADFind, and Cobalt Strike for discovery and lateral
movement.
Other commercial tools, such as AnyDesk, can also be used by Conti to maintain
persistence on compromised targets.
Exfiltration

11/14

Mega cloud storage can be used for the information exfiltration phase.
Defense evasion
Defense evasion can be performed through the use of third-party tools like PC Hunter,
Process Hacker, and Revo Uninstaller.
Conti also disables some security tools found in compromised systems.

How to defend systems against ransomware
For enterprises to protect themselves from ransomware attacks, it would help to establish
ransomware defense plans. These can be based on security frameworks, such as those
from the Center of Internet Security (CIS) and the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST). These guidelines can help with prioritization and resource management
for prevention, defense, and recovery from ransomware.
Beyond the technical means, it is important to understand that attackers will use any
identified weakness within a target organization (such as customer data, mishandled
personal identifiable information [PII], or accounting mistakes) as pressure points to leverage
the ransom negotiation value and make the victim pay. Enterprises should therefore take
these issues into account when evaluating their organizational readiness to protect
themselves from ransomware attacks.
Some of the best practices from these frameworks are as follows:
Audit events and take inventory.
Take note of the following:
Available assets and data
Authorized and unauthorized devices and software
Security events and incidents
Configure and monitor.
Manage and keep track of the following:
Hardware and software configurations
Admin privileges and access
Activity in network ports, protocols, and services
Network infrastructure devices, such as firewalls and routers, and their security
configurations
Patch and update.
Regularly perform the following for software and applications:
12/14

Vulnerability assessments
Patching or virtual patching
Version update
Protect systems and recover data.
Implement the following:
Data protection, backup, and recovery measures
Multifactor authentication (MFA)
Secure and defend layers.
Employ the following:
The defense in depth (DiD) principle. This is done by creating multiple layers of
defense against potential threats. One example of this is by blocking unused services
not just on afirewall but alsoon actual servers.
Network segmentation and the least-privilege principle. It is paramount to follow
these when granting permissions to system users, services, and roles.
Email static and dynamic analysis. Both of these work to examine and block
malicious emails.
The latest version of security solutions to all layers of the system. These layers
include email, endpoint, web, and network.
Monitoring for early signs of an attack. Identifying the questionable presence
of various tools in the system can save organizations much time and effort in staving off
possible attacks.
Advanced detection technologies. In particular, technologies powered with AI and
machine learning offer fortified protection.
Train and test.
Conduct the following regularly:
Security skills assessment and training
Red team exercises and penetration tests
