Restricting the download and execution of third-party software is critically important.
Thursday, April 20, 2023 By: Counter Threat Unit Research Team
Using malicious Google Ads or SEO poisoning to distribute malware has become a common
tactic for cybercriminals. For example, in the Secureworks® 2022 State of the Threat report,
Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers described legitimate web searches being hijacked
1/9

by SEO poisoning to infect victims’ systems with Gootloader, and malicious Google Ads
bundling infostealers like RedLine in trojanized installers for messaging apps such as Signal.
Recently, CTU™ researchers observed Bumblebee malware distributed via trojanized
installers for popular software such as Zoom, Cisco AnyConnect, ChatGPT, and Citrix
Workspace. Bumblebee is a modular loader, historically distributed primarily through
phishing, that has been used to deliver payloads commonly associated with ransomware
deployments. Trojanizing installers for software that is particularly topical (e.g., ChatGPT) or
software commonly used by remote workers increases the likelihood of new infections.
One of the Bumblebee samples CTU researchers analyzed was downloaded from http:
//appcisco . com/vpncleint/cisco-anyconnect-4_9_0195.msi. On or around February 16,
2023, a threat actor created a fake download page for Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility
Client v4.x (see Figure 1) on the appcisco . com domain. An infection chain that began with a
malicious Google Ad sent the user to this fake download page via a compromised
WordPress site.

The cisco-anyconnect-4_9_0195.msi file is an MSI installer that contains two files (see
Figure 2).

When the MSI installer is executed, renamed versions of these two files are copied to the
“%Temp%\Package Installation Dir” folder (see Figure 3) and executed.

FILE_InstallMeCisco (renamed to CiscoSetup.exe) is a legitimate installer for the Cisco
AnyConnect VPN Secure Mobility Client application. FILE_InstallMeExe (renamed to
cisco2.ps1) is a PowerShell script. CTU researchers identified other samples that used the
same technique with a different software installer and related PowerShell script name, such
as Zoom (ZoomInstaller.exe and zoom.ps1), ChatGPT (ChatGPT.msi and chch.ps1) and
Citrix (CitrixWorkspaceApp.exe and citrix.ps1).
The PowerShell script contains a selection of renamed functions copied from the
PowerSploit ReflectivePEInjection.ps1 script. It also contains an encoded Bumblebee
malware payload that it reflectively loads into memory.
In one compromised environment, CTU researchers observed the threat actor moving
laterally approximately three hours after infection, and deploying Cobalt Strike as well as the
legitimate AnyDesk and DameWare remote access tools. The attacker used a Scheduled
Task named WindowsSensor15 as a persistence mechanism for Cobalt Strike. Additional
tools deployed by the threat actor included pshashes.txt, which is likely a script for
conducting Kerberoasting attacks; a batch script to dump the contents of the Active Directory
database; and a network scanning utility (netscanold.exe). These tools were dropped in the
C:\ProgramData directory. Network defenders detected the activity and disrupted access
before the attacker achieved their objective, which was likely to deploy ransomware.
To mitigate this and similar threats, organizations should ensure that software installers and
updates are only downloaded from known and trusted websites. Users should not have
privileges to install software and run scripts on their computers. Tools such as AppLocker
can prevent malware from being executed even if it is inadvertently downloaded.

3/9

CTU researchers identified numerous indicators associated with this threat (see Table 1).
Due to the large number of C2 IP addresses extracted from the Bumblebee malware
configuration data, the table only lists a subset. However, all identified indicators have been
applied to Secureworks customer protections. Note that IP addresses can be reallocated.
The IP addresses and domains may contain malicious content, so consider the risks before
