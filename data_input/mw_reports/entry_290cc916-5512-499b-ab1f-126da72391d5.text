Executive Summary
The Russian invasion of Ukraine has caused a substantial increase in cyberattacks. The
public and private organizations can be impacted even before they are not located in the
region. Therefore, the SOCRadar analyst team, monitoring the situation from its early
hours, has gathered initial findings in this blog post.
Here is what you should know about the cyber repercussions of the Russian-Ukraine war:
Beginning from January 13, 2022, various companies in Ukraine were infected with
harmful malware designed to render targeted machines useless. The malware deleted
victims’ machines before passing itself off as a ransomware attack without offering a
ransom payment and recovery mechanism.
The first wave of cyberattacks on February 15th, mostly potent DDoS, targeted
Ukrainian government organizations. Several agencies, including the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and the Security and Defense Council, were impacted.

Following the Russian troops’ invasion, the second wave of DDoS attacks started on
February 23. The target included government agencies and two of the largest stateowned banks. Attacks were paired with some disinformation attempts in which SMS
were sent to customers falsely claiming the ATMs were out of order.
In addition to DDoS attacks, two malware equipped with significant destructive
capabilities has been found in the attacks. HermeticWiper is utilized to delete the data
in a digital device that cannot be recovered. Recently discovered Cyclops Blink is
employed to exfiltrate data from the network.
Underground groups such as Anonymous and Conti ransomware groups have picked
their sides in the cyber conflict. The largest hacktivist initiative, Anonymous, launched
a virtual war against Russia. Conti, the notorious ransomware gang, decided to stand
with Russia threatening to attack any rivals’ critical infrastructure.
Dark web forums have become a show-off platform for warring factions. Detected by
SOCRadar, several posts have been published alleging that sensitive information from
the government organizations was leaked.
You can also find lists of IoCs, TTPs, and Yara rules in this article.

What Happened So Far?
During the 2021–2022 Russian – Ukrainian crisis, a series of cyberattacks took down
more than a dozen of Ukraine’s government websites, including the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, the Cabinet of Ministers, and the Security and Defense Council.
After recognizing territorial claims of self-declared separatist republics in eastern Ukraine,
Russian force deployments in these regions coincided with two massive DDoS attacks
(Distributed Denial-of-Service) with destructive malware implications targeting Ukraine.
The first wave of cyber-attacks on Ukraine started on February 15th, and the second one
on February 23rd, made many Ukrainian governments, military, and bank websites
inaccessible.
Russian cyberattacks against Ukraine have led hackers, ransomware gangs, and
companies to pick upsides. Underground groups publicly expressed their side in the military
conflict.
In the underground world, the actors have diverse decisions. Conti, the notorious
ransomware group and claimed to be a state-sponsored threat actor, announced that they
will strike back if cyber-attacks are conducted against Russia. In two different posts, the
group states that they would target the opposite countries’ critical infrastructure on its official
website.

Which Cyber Threat Actor Takes Which Side in the Ukraine-Russia War?

Many different cyber threat actors who continue their operations on the dark web have
actively participated in the
Russia-Ukraine war in cyberspace
. During the conflict that has lasted for nearly a week, many threat actors have declared
their sides or switched sides. Many threats, from hacktivist groups to ransomware gangs,
announced their support for one of the warring parties.

First, the Anonymous group announced that it had declared its support for Ukraine. After
this announcement, some websites belonging to Russia’s state and private sector became
unavailable.
In another tweet, Anonymous TV, an account close to Anonymous, claimed that
Anonymous leaked the database of the Russian Ministry of Defense website. The group
also claimed to breach Tetradr, a Belarusian weapon manufacturer and leaked about
200GB of emails.

3/22

Conti ransomware group
, which has made a name for itself with its organized ransomware attacks, announced that it
sided with Russia. It was noted that the group exhibited a slightly softer attitude in the
second statement made later. In this statement, Conti claimed that they did not support the
war. Some insiders not happy with Conti’s support for Russia leaked inside jabber chats of
the group.

The CoomingProject group, which has been selling/sharing the data it has obtained from
critical institutions since 2021 on Russian-speaking hacker forums, was also among the
hacker groups that sided with
Russia
. The Cooming Project has announced that they will respond if the Russian

4/22

government targets a cyberattack
.
LockBit
announced that it was not a party to the war. Noting that there are hackers from different
nationalities within the group, the group stated that people from many countries, not only
from
Ukraine and Russia
but also from China to the USA, are working for them. “Business is important to us, and we
all take an apolitical stance. We are only concerned with money.”
Along with Anonymous, another hacktivist group targeting Russia
is AgainstTheWest. In the statement made by the group, it was stated that the systems of
various Russian government institutions were infected with ransomware, attacked with
data-destroying malware, and all the data were seized.
The Red Bandits, known for their data breach attacks, CyberGhost, and Sandworm groups,
known for their hacking and
DDoS attacks
, were shared on the hacker channels that they were Russian supporters. It is known that
the Raidforum Admins group, which came to the fore with cyber sanctions against
Russia, is in the ranks of Ukraine.
Some groups that carried out DDoS attacks on behalf of Ukraine are as follows as of
February 27: “IT Army of
Ukraine
, BlackHawk, and Anonymous Liberland & PWN Bar hack team.” It is understood that the
ransomware group called Belarussian Cyber Partisans is a supporter of “free Ukraine,” as
far as it is followed on Twitter channels.
On the other side, the Lapsu$ extortion group claimed to breach Nvidia, one of the largest
technology manufacturers in the world. The US and western sanctions in retaliation for
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine shut off the supply from leading US groups such as Intel, AMD,
and Nvidia at Russia’s military and its tech industry. After the sanction decision, Russian
origin hacker groups allegedly shared data about hashes of Nvidia’s employees on a
Telegram Channel monitored by SOCRadar.

2022 Russian-Ukrainian Crisis: The FirstWave of Cyberattacks

6/22

Beginning from January 13, 2022, various companies in Ukraine were infected with harmful
malware designed to render targeted machines useless.
The malware deleted victims’ machines before passing itself off as a ransomware attack
without offering a ransom payment and recovery mechanism.
The malware has infected multiple Ukrainian government institutions, non-profit, and
information technology organizations.
On February 15th, Ukraine became the victim of numerous powerful DDoS attacks again,
resulting in the disruption of services in government agencies and state-owned banks.
7/22

The affected enterprises were two of the largest state-owned banks, namely Privatbank and
Oschadbank, and several other government agencies, including the Ministry of Defense
and the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
The attacks were carried out by flooding the web servers with high traffic volumes the
server could not handle. As a result, the servers were inaccessible for several hours. Many
Ukrainians could not use mobile banking apps and log into their accounts on the abovementioned banks’ websites, even though they were up and running.

Fake SMS messages customers of Privatbank received

on February 15th
On the same day, customers of Privatbank has received fake SMS messages claiming that
the ATMs of the bank were down, according to the cyberpolice of Ukraine. The cyberpolice
stated that these SMS messages did not reflect reality and were just mere parts of an
“information attack.”
In addition to the state-owned banks, the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces of
Ukraine were also attacked on the 15th of February. The website of the Ministry of Defense
was taken down, unable to operate for several hours.
Ukraine’s online news agency Ukranyska Pravda states that these attacks are potent DDoS
attacks on government agencies and have never happened before on this scale.

A Snapshot shows that the Ministry of Defense was inaccessible on February 15th.

The Second Wave of Cyber Attacks on Ukraine: Deadlier than the
First Wave
8/22

On the 23rd of February, Ukraine woke up to a new series of cyber-attacks threatening to
disrupt the services of enterprises and several government agencies of Ukraine.
These cyber-attacks were in parallel with Ukraine’s invasion by the Russian military. As
the Russian army crossed Ukraine’s border, numerous malicious cyber-attacks believed to
be coming from Russia were launched.
Two of the largest state-owned banks (Privatbank and Oschadbank) were targeted once
again, along with several government agencies with a non-ending stream of DDoS attacks.
The websites of government agencies, including the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the targeted banks became
inaccessible due to the attacks.
The State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection of Ukraine said on
the 23rd of February, acknowledging the attacks and the aftermath:
“Today, websites of a number of government and banking institutions have undergone a
massive DDoS attack again. Some of the attacked information systems are not available or
work intermittently. It is due to switching traffic to another provider to minimize damage.”
Along with DDoS attacks targeting Ukrainian organizations, two important cybersecurity
firms, namely ESET and Broadcom’s Symantec, revealed that a new data-wiper malware
had targeted Ukrainian organizations’ computer networks.
The new data-wiper is a malware that deletes data on a device for the data to be
unrecoverable and the operating system to stop working correctly.
Besides the new data-wiper, a new malware known as Cyclops Blink, which targets the
Ukrainian organizations in the second wave of cyberattacks, has been identified by a joint
UK – US advisory and might be used remotely to access networks.
The malware is believed to be utilized by Sandworm, an APT group. In the past, the group
has been linked to the Russian GRU.
Moreover, Cyclops Blink looks to be a replacement for the VPNFilter malware that was
discovered in 2018, and its deployment could allow Sandworm to access networks
remotely.
Western Allies of Ukraine declare their readiness to support Ukraine in cyberspace. The
European Defence Agency (EDA) tweeted on 24 February that Cyber Rapid Response
Team (CRRT) was activated following a request from Ukraine. EDA website states that
CRRT will support Ukraine in monitoring the threat landscape and detecting and mitigating
cyber attacks.

9/22

On the other hand, news outlets reported on 24 February that some Russian government
entities’ websites were not accessible. The official website of the Ministry of Defence of the
Russian Federation was responding with “HTTP ERROR 418” by 7 PM on 24 February. We
understand that Russia blocked access to this domain based on geography as a security
mechanism.

What are the Dark Web Activities Related to Russia-Ukraine War?
On the dark web, threat actors allegedly began to sell database data of citizens of Ukraine
and data from several Government departments.

10/22

RaidForum deleted some posts related to the Ukraine Hack.

One of the posts allegedly shared a leak of US Special Operation Command.

Some of the information allegedly to be shared in the forums, on the other hand, claims that
data sharing against Russia has started.

Technical Analysis of Russian Cyber Weapons
HermeticWiper: A Catastrophic Malware
ESET Research has found that a new data wiper malware dubbed HermeticWiper has been
discovered on Ukrainian computers and machines in Latvia and Lithuania. ESET products
first detected the malware as Win32/KillDisk.NCV around 3 p.m. UTC on Wednesday,
12/22

February 23rd, 2022.
The compilation timestamp shows December 28th, 2021, which suggests the attack was
prepared for at least two months. The wiper attacks started after a series of DDoS attacks
hit several important websites in the country and brought them down.
Since it is a developing story, some details might change, but HermeticWiper abuses some
legitimate drivers from the EaseUS Partition Master software.
After the initial entry, attackers took control of the Active Directory (AD) server and pushed it
using the default Group Policy Object (GPO). In the case of an attack against at least one
organization in Ukraine, the attackers seemed to gain access to the network on December
23, 2021, via malicious SMB activity against a Microsoft Exchange Server, according to the
Symantec Threat Hunter Team. It was immediately followed by credential theft.
A web shell was also installed on January 16, before the wiper was deployed on February
23. However, it is not obvious how the initial access to the Active Directory was gained.
The malware called HermeticWiper referenced the digital certificate used to sign the
sample. Sentinel Labs’ initial analysis shows that the digital certificate is issued under
‘Hermetica Digital Ltd’ and is valid as of April 2021. There are no known legitimate files
signed with this certificate.
How Does It Work?
According to Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade from Sentinel Labs, Hermetic Wiper uses a
known and tested technique similar to the Lazarus Group (Destover) and APT33
(Shamoon) with Eldos Rawdisk. However, the Wiper abuses a different driver:
empntdrv[.]sys

to access the file system without calling Windows APIs. After that, the Hermetic Wiper
focuses on corrupting the first 512 bytes, the Master Boot Record (MBR), for every physical
drive to stop the booting process.
Who Gets Affected by HermeticWiper?
The target seems to be the host computers in critical networks. The malware does not try to
steal or exfiltrate data, but it just destroys it. In a time of crisis, the malware could create
chaos by deleting importing data stored in the personal computers of the key personnel.
Targeted Devices: Windows device

Cyclops Blink: The New Weapon of Cyber-Warfare
U.S. and U.K. government agencies published a joint report on a new malware strain called
Cyclops Blink.
The report stated that Sandworm (aka Voodoo Bear or BlackEnergy) APT group developed
a new malware to be used to remotely compromise network devices, primarily small
office/home office (SOHO) routers and network-attached storage (NAS) devices. The group
is a part of Russia’s (foreign military intelligence agency) GRU’s Main Centre for Special
Technologies or GTsST.
The malicious cyber activities such as disruption of Ukrainian electricity in 2015, Industroyer
in 2016, NotPetya in 2017, the Winter Olympics and Paralympics in 2018 cyberattacks, and
attacks against Georgia in 2019 were all attributed to Sandworm. The new malware,
Cyclops Blink, appears to replace the VPNFilter malware exposed in 2018.
15/22

According to the report, NCSC, CISA, FBI, NSA, and industry partners have identified a
large-scale modular malware framework affecting network devices. This new malware strain
is named Cyclops Blink. The report claims that the malware deployed at least June 2019,
fourteen months after its successor VPNFilter was disrupted.
As with VPNFilter, Cyclops Blink deployment also seems indiscriminate and widespread. So
far, Cyclops Blink has been only deployed to WatchGuard devices by Sandworm.
(WatchGuard Technologies Inc. is a network security vendor that provides products
designed to protect computer networks from outside threats.) However, Sandworm could
likely use the malware to target other architectures and firmware.
The malware is highly sophisticated and modular, capable of sending device information
back to a C2 server. Cyclops Blink could download and execute files. The modular nature of
the malware also allows Sandworm to implement additional functionalities as needed.
After the exploitation, Cyclops Blink will generally arrive in a firmware update that achieves
persistence once the target device is rebooted, making it very hard to remove. Then the
malware organizes the victim’s devices into clusters, and each deployment has a list of
command and controls IP addresses and ports it uses.
The data transferred between Sandworm and compromised devices are protected with
Transport Layer Security using individually generated keys and certificates. Sandworm
manages compromised devices over the Tor network.
Another important note is that Cyclops Blink warn that Cyclops survives through a reboot
and legitimate firmware updates. Therefore, the removing process is not easy and should
be completed carefully using the directives from the WatchGuard.

Katana: DDoS Attacks to Ukraine
One of the cyber-attack prongs which Russia used against Ukraine is DDoS attacks. Some
Ukrainian websites were not accessible due to heavy DDoS attacks both on February 15
and 16. Banks, Government, and Military websites were impacted. Both UK and US officials
have attributed these attacks to a known Russian GRU infrastructure stating The US has
technical data to back it up.
Fortunately, the attacks` scale was only moderate. Therefore, the impacted sites recovered
within hours. During attacks, it is reported that some customers could not access the
banking websites and, in minimal cases, ATMs became unavailable too. In addition to these
attacks, some fraudulent SMS messages were sent to Ukrainian phones, possibly creating
panic.
The text messages said, “Due to technical circumstances, Privatbank ATMs do not work on
February 15. We apologize”. These messages were sent from Polish, Austrian and
Estonian numbers. Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine also reported a
denial of service attack against the ”.gov.ua” DNS servers; and a BGP hijacking attack
against the Privatbank IP space causing difficulties routing traffic to their network.
According to the Ukrainian CERT, 360Netlab, and BadPackets, the source of these attacks
was a Mirai botnet. Researchers matched the gathered IOCs to a botnet named Katana,
which is, in fact, a variant of Mirai with improved DDoS capabilities. Katana source code is

18/22

available for purchase for less than a thousand dollars, and it is possibly shared for free on
some deep and dark websites.
According to Malpedia, Mirai was one of the first significant botnets targeting exposed
networking devices running Linux. Mirai was first discovered in August 2016 by
MalwareMustDie.
It targeted various networked embedded devices such as IP cameras, home routers
belonging to many different vendors, and other IoT devices. Since the source code was
published on “Hack Forums,” many variants of the Mirai family appeared, infecting mostly
home networks worldwide.
When an IoT device like network cameras are publicly accessible, they could be easily
targeted and were exploited by the attacker to perform the DDoS. Due to how the exploit
works, the records of their exploitation can be seen by anyone. It should also be noted that
a file matching the attack IoCs was uploaded to the VirusTotal on February 13th.
Therefore, compromising the IoT devices had been started at least a couple of days before
the DDoS attacks. Even though the impacted sites came back online relatively quickly, this
does not dismiss the fact that this was a sophisticated and well-organized attack to create
instability and chaos in Ukraine.

Yara Rules for Katana:

Mitigation for Katana:
It is the ISP level filtering of all traffic that may come from abroad, except for the traffic
that will come from abroad and which does not make sense to be blocked (Search
engine traffic, etc.).
Attacks from within the country are generally low. Potential amplifier IP addresses that
can use for high-dimensional DDoS attacks should be uploaded to the security wall /
IPS systems in a list and activated in monitoring mode.

How the Cyber-war Escalating Between Russia and Ukraine as
Conflict Became Brutal?
In addition to recent interventions, Russia’s cyberattacks against Ukraine date back to
earlier times.
The cyber warfare between Russia and Ukraine is a part of the confrontation which goes
back to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Russian cyberwar capabilities had been
available since 2005 with Uroburos. The first recorded Russian cyberattacks against
Ukraine happened during the mass protests in 2013.

20/22

In an operation called Armageddon, a Russian campaign of systematic cyber espionage on
the information systems of law enforcement and defense agencies started to help Russia
on the battlefield.
In 2014, DDoS attacks and cyber espionage were common during the Crimea Crisis. On
December 23, 2015, a cyber-attack on Ukraine’s power grid resulted in power outages for
roughly 230,000 consumers in the country for 1-6 hours. The attack is attributed to a
Russian APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) group known as “Sandworm.” The mass supplychain attack 2017 using Petya was the most potent known hacker attack according to the
US Presidential Administration.
Therefore, cyber warfare was always part of the contemporary Russia-Ukraine conflict. As a
result, it was not a surprise that the special cyber activity reports came just hours before
Russian forces began the invasion of neighboring Ukraine.

What to Do to Mitigate Potential Impacts of the Russian-Ukrainian Cyber Crisis?
Since there is no single attack vector or a new type of malware used in the Russian –
Ukrainian cyberattacks, there is no single way of protecting your organization against
critical cyber threats in the escalating cyber crisis.
Countries that make quick statements about their side in the conflict are the first to be
targeted in global political crises. It can be predicted that cyberattacks from Russia will
increase in the coming days. Against potential attacks, SOCRadar’s recommendations are
as follows:
Cyberattacks could come in various forms and have disastrous effects on your organization.
To minimize risk and protect your organization, analysts at SOCRadar suggest you to:
Accelerate Incident Response: Reducing incident response time is crucial for
organizations to mitigate the potential consequences. Alert your SOC team, implement a
mitigation action plan in case of a cyber-attack, and test your communication and backup
protocols.
Update and Patch Software in Endpoints: Unpatched vulnerabilities could be exploited to
gain access and damage your organization in any way possible, so it is crucial to update
and patch critical software in your organization’s endpoints. It is suggested that all software
be updated to the latest release.
Backup Your Data in case of a Ransomware Attack or Data-wiping: The new
HermeticWiper malware has targeted organizations in Ukraine and destroyed
organizations’ data without leaving any chance of recovery. It is strongly suggested that all
sensitive and important data is backed up, and recovery and backup protocols are
thoroughly tested to quickly recover from data-wiping and ransomware attacks.

The vast majority of ransomware attacks that have affected almost every country in the last
two years are originated in Russia. To be protected from these attacks, it is essential to
regularly check the attack surface that is open to the internet and regularly scan it for critical
vulnerabilities.
One of the main ways to protect from malware and ransomware attacks is using EDR/EPP
software. We recommend that you monitor your infrastructure against cyber operations
carried out by integrating IOCs shared by SOCRadar into SIEM, XDR, and EDR systems.
Scan your Endpoints to Detect Anomalies: Any unclosed RDP (Remote Desktop
Protocol) ports along with compromised credentials could seriously damage your
organization’s infrastructure and result in an unrecoverable cyberattack. It is strongly
suggested that security scans and tests are carried out to detect anomalies in your
endpoints and prevent potential cyberattacks.
Be aware of DDoS attacks: As the conflict continues and more countries declare their side
in this conjuncture, it will be inevitable for DDoS attacks to head towards other countries
and their critical infrastructures. In such cases, we recommend preparing a “Plan B” for
companies/institutions in regions where the attack is likely to escalate to be activated at the
time of the attack.
The first item of your “Plan B” should be filtering at the ISP level of all traffic, except for the
traffic that will come from abroad and does not make sense to be blocked (Traffic that
comes from search engine traffic, etc.).
The attacks that may come from within your country are generally low-level. The potential
“amplifier IP addresses” that can be used for high-dimensional DDoS attacks should be
uploaded to the firewall/IPS systems in a list. These should be activated in monitoring
mode.
SOCRadar observes that many social media accounts and domain purchases are made for
phishing and disinformation purposes. In this context, if SOC teams are using it, we
recommend DNS monitoring solutions or following such newly acquired domains in
monitoring mode via SIEM. Finally, we also recommend following the CERTs and
newsletters issued by CISA.
