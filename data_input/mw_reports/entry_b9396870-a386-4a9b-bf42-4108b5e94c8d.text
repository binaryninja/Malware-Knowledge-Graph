Walking on APT31 infrastructure footprints

November 10, 2021

SEKOIA.IO’s Cyber Threat Intelligence team had an in-depth look at the APT31 intrusion
set at the beginning of 2021 when the BfV (Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz)¹ and
McAfee² released some new information. A few months later, the French National
Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI) also released a short publication with several IoCs³, showing
that the intrusion set was still active and of concern as multiple national agencies had been
involved.
All of these IoCs were mainly IP addresses, and many of them seemed to be linked to
SOHO routers, mostly Pakedge routers at the time. With that observation, we investigated
more deeply to see if we could find more infrastructure and implants used by this intrusion
set.

A brief on the APT31 creature
1/12

APT31 (aka Zirconium or Judgment Panda) is an Advanced Persistent Threat group whose
mission is likely to gather intelligence on behalf of the Chinese government. Similar to other
nation-state actors, the group is focusing on data of interest to the PRC (People’s
Republic of China) and its strategic and geopolitical ambitions, rather than on specific
verticals.
The Chinese adversaries are considered some of the most prolific state-sponsored
cyber actors on the planet. According to Microsoft’s observations, from July 2020 to June
2021, China-based threat actors displayed the strongest interest in targeting critical
infrastructure among all the other nation-state threats⁴.

Figure 1. A timeline of the publicly reported APT31-related campaigns
As shown in Figure 1 and in alignment with available public reports, APT31 has been active
since at least 2013 and its 2021 campaign targeting numerous French entities is still
ongoing.

Even if the public literature on this intrusion set is quite limited, APT31 is known to use —
among others vectors — spear phishing to get a foothold in the victims’ networks. Although
their recent campaigns weren’t technically sophisticated, they succeeded in bypassing
network defences by employing only legitimate websites and services to host their implants
(GitHub) and interact with them once executed on the victims’ workstation (use of
DropBoxAPI)⁵. It has also been spotted targeting organizations via SQL injection attacks, as
well as leveraging stolen credentials to gain initial access.
APT31 and other Chinese state–backed actors have been lately the object of several
European governments’ attribution statements. Back in July 2021, the UK accused the
Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) of supporting the APT31 group’s activities⁶. At
nearly the same time, the EU detected malicious cyber activities with significant effects that
targeted key European industries and linked them to APT31⁷. In both cases, official
statements mentioned APT31 alongside another Chinese attacker group — APT40.

Moreover, authorities suspect APT31 to be a group of contractors working directly for
China’s MSS, or even members of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Strategic Support
Force, as reported by other sources.

Hunting in the APT31 infrastructure footprints
APT31 is one of the few intrusion sets known to have been seen compromising SOHO
routers to compose its operational infrastructure, since at least November 2019, date on
which a sample of the backdoor used on compromised routers was uploaded to VirusTotal
for analysis (MD5: 77c73b8b1846652307862dd66ec09ebf). However, this implant can be
much older as there is no compilation date associated with ELF files.
The Operational Relay Boxes (ORB) associated with this infrastructure are used as proxies
for frontal attacks, active and passive reconnaissance and also as command and control
servers for several implants. Till today, we don’t know how they compromised these
routers. It is likely that they used a mix of known and unknown vulnerabilities to achieve
remote code execution in order to drop their implants and other redirector tools.
We found ways and heuristics to illuminate some parts of their infrastructure and track it over
time. The C2 domains used by this intrusion set have several characteristics such as:
Patterns: lots of domains had technical strings such as “update”, “check”, “cloud” or
“service” along with some IOT/router’s brands (Mikrotik, Netgear, Qnap, Nec).
DNS configuration: most of them don’t resolve anything without an appropriate
subdomain such as “www”, “api”, “sso” etc.
DNS providers: APT31 mainly uses four DNS providers: Monovm, Cloudflare, Topdns
and most recently Hosteons, which we’ve seen used only for two domains so far.
Fake registrant and associated email: the name is mostly composed like a real name
(eg. Joseph Edwards) with an associated email address using protonmail.ch, email.cz,
post.cz or inbox.lv.
The resolution timeframe of these domains doesn’t exceed a few days, which is also
relevant from an analyst’s point of view.
As the domains were resolving to SOHO routers, it was also possible to track them using this
particularity. Indeed, it is relatively rare that a domain from these DNS providers points
to some domestic autonomous systems.

On the other hand, the network appliances compromised by APT31 have technical
characteristics (eg. administration panels, specific certificates or banners) allowing anybody
to recover thousands of IP addresses using them. By using passive DNS resolutions on
these IP addresses, it was possible to discover new C2s when an observed FQDN pointing
to them had the previously mentioned characteristics.
Finally, we discovered nearly 50 IP addresses and 34 domain names following ANSSI’s
publication, with an overlap of one IP address resolved by the domain www.fwcheck[.]com.
The table below summarises the brands of network appliances that composed the C2
infrastructure used by APT31 until July 2021. The confidence value depends on the number
of heuristics (explained above) that matched as well as on whether other sources already
mentionned the C2 or not.

Since July 2021, we have observed a shift in their infrastructure. They left their historical
“Pakedge infrastructure” and moved it to new clusters composed this time of several other
brands and nameservers in order to avoid infrastructure illumination by analysts.
Since then, it has become more difficult to follow their tracks although we can still see
several new C2s such as neccloud[.]net — resolving to 5.252.176[.]102, a server under the
MivoCloud umbrella — or netgearcloud[.]net, resolving to a domestic IP address based in
Sweden on September 22, 2021. We link these domains to APT31 with high confidence as
they match most of the infrastructure heuristics established during the investigation.
However, it’s worth noting that not all their Operational Relay Boxes are resolved by domains
names. Thenceforth, the IoCs list provided at the end of this blogpost is obviously nonexhaustive and shows only a small fraction of their operational infrastructure used for
attacks in 2021.

Implants seen during the walk
By looking at the implants connecting to this infrastructure in open source, we have been
able to get several implants, that we assess were used by APT31 during their operations,
such as Cobalt Strike beacons and an ELF implant dubbed “unifi-video” (MD5:
4640805c362b1e5bee5312514dd0ab2b), impersonating a well known IOT brand.

SEKOIA.IO Intelligence Center.
Among standard red-teaming tools, APT31 seems to be using Cobalt Strike as an n-stage
implant to persist inside the victim’s network. As shown in the table below, several beacons
connecting to the “Pakedge infrastructure” have been sent to VirusTotal packed in a PE to
VirusTotal. It is worth noting that as they have been packed in an executable file, the
corresponding hash can’t be used to hunt for APT31 in your network.

Description

Unfortunately, the configurations associated with the discovered Cobalt Strike beacons are
pretty common and prevented us from getting more discriminant indicators linked to their use
of Cobalt Strike.
During the hunting, we found an ELF implant on VirusTotal⁸ which matched the C2 —
hardcoded in the sample — www[.]moperfectstore[.]com. We attribute this domain with
medium to high confidence to APT31 as it resolved to Pakedge and CyberOAM
appliances and matches some domain heuristics described above. As the domain didn’t
have any existence prior to 2021, we assess with medium to high confidence that the implant
was used by APT31.
This implant, dubbed “unifi-video” (MD5: 4640805c362b1e5bee5312514dd0ab2b), is a
statically-linked stripped 64bits ELF. Unifi-video is a well known legitimate software that
describes itself as a “Centralized management system for Ubiquiti UniFi surveillance
cameras”. It therefore echoes the compromised-appliance infrastructure used by APT31.
When analysing the file we noticed several routines overlapping with a known minimalistic
Unix backdoor named Rekoobe which was covered previously by a few cybersecurity
vendors such as Dr Web⁹ and Intezer¹⁰.
However, several questions remain unanswered regarding the real APT31 and Rekoobe
connection.
First, we don’t know at the time of writing whether Rekoobe’s source code is shared between
different threat actors or if Rekoobe has been operated by APT31 since it was first
discovered in 2015. Moreover, if APT31 operated this sample of Rekoobe, there is no
6/12

indication whether this implant is used in the infrastructure or to persist in an
appliance of a final victim, somewhere.
ERRATUM (12/11/2021): While we initially thought that the implant
(4640805c362b1e5bee5312514dd0ab2b) was linked to Rekoobe, the security researcher
Billy Leonard pointed out on Twitter [Billy Leonard’s tweet] that it was actually Tiny SHell
[GitHub repo] which we definitely agree. Tiny SHell has been used by multiple threat actors
since several years now and it is not surprising to see APT31 using it.

Conclusion
Despite the lack of open source literature on this intrusion set, APT31 remains a prolific
threat for years for many occidental entities working on government and strategic
issues. As of today, we don’t have a clear view of what they are looking for once they
compromised the networks if it is for pre-positioning or data theft.
This blog post aimed to disclose some of their operational infrastructure and tools used this
year so that you can look for possible compromises in your networks.

your network logs, the IP addresses can produce false positives as they rely mostly on legit
home routers. All the IOCs can be downloaded in JSON STIX2.1 and CSV formats on the
