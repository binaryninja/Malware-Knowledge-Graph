Inside the Cyberespionage Campaign Targeting Gambling Operations
In 2019, Talent-Jump Technologies, Inc. reached out to Trend Micro about a backdoor they
discovered during an incident response operation. We provided further intelligence and
analysis on the backdoor, which we learned was being used by an advanced persistent
threat (APT) actor that we dubbed "DRBControl." The threat actor is currently targeting users
in Southeast Asia, particularly gambling and betting companies. Europe and the Middle East
were also reported to us as being targeted, but we could not confirm this at the time of
writing. Exfiltrated data was mostly comprised of databases and source codes, which led us
to believe that the group's main purpose is cyberespionage.
The campaign uses two previously unidentified backdoors. Known malware families such as
PlugX and the HyperBro backdoor, as well as custom post-exploitation tools were also found
in the attacker's arsenal. Interestingly, one of the backdoors used file hosting service
Dropbox as its command-and-control (C&C) channel. We disclosed our findings to Dropbox,
which expired the tokens used in the campaign in August 2019 and has since been working
with Trend Micro on the issues.

OPERATION DRBCONTROL
A newly identified threat actor behind a cyberespionage campaign targets gambling and
betting entities by using publicly available and custom tools to elevate privileges and perform
lateral movements. One of the deployed malware uses Dropbox as a way to communicate
and exfiltrate data from targets.

Targets
DRBControl targets gambling and betting operations in Southeast Asia.

GAMBLING
BETTING
The threat actors behind the campaign use a variety of post-exploitation tools, such as a
clipboard stealer, network traffic tunnel, brute-force tool, and password dumpers.

Operations
The first-stage intrusion uses spear-phishing .DOCX files. DRBControl distributes three
versions of the infecting documents.
The campaign primarily takes advantage of two backdoors, both of which use DLL
side-loading through the Microsoft-signed MSMpEng.exe file.
The type 1 backdoor already has nine versions, all developed between May to October
2019. All versions use the file hosting service Dropbox as their C&C channel.
The type 2 backdoor uses a configuration file that has the C&C domain and connection
port, as well as the directory and filename where the malware is copied. The file also
sets its persistence mechanism.
In most cases, IP addresses could be resolved only for subdomains hardcoded in
malware samples; no IP address was linked to the domain names themselves.
Known malware families (e.g., PlugX RAT, Trochilus RAT, and HyperBro backdoor) and
software Cobalt Strike were also utilized in the campaign.

Network Activities
Connections with Other APT Campaigns
Different malware identified with Winnti and Emissary Panda campaigns. Links to the Winnti
group range from mutexes to domain names and issued commands. The HyperBro
backdoor, which appears to be exclusive to Emissary Panda, was also used in this
campaign.

Key Findings:
3/6

The DRBControl campaign attacks its targets using a variety of malware and techniques that
coincide with those used in other known cyberespionage campaigns. The threat actors
maintain a diverse infrastructure and take advantage of post-exploitation tools to further their
operations.
The campaign not only uses file hosting service Dropbox as its C&C channel, but also for the
delivery of different payloads. Dropbox repositories were also found to store information such
as commands and post-exploitation tools, target user's workstation information, and stolen
files.

Conclusion
Unlike largely indiscriminate attacks that focus on typical forms of cybercrime, targeted
attacks differ in terms of how threat actors actively pursue and compromise specific targets
(i.e., through spear phishing) for lateral movement in the network and sensitive information
extraction. Understanding attack tools, techniques, and infrastructure, as well as the links to
similar attack campaigns, provides the context necessary to assess potential impact and
4/6

adopt defensive measures. Trend Micro users can thwart advanced persistent threats with
security that provide actionable threat intelligence, network-wide visibility, and timely threat
protection.
Read our detailed findings in our research paper, "Uncovering DRBControl: Inside the
Cyberespionage Campaign Targeting Gambling Operations," which looks into the malware
that DRBControl uses, its relations to known APT groups, other noteworthy points of their
activities, and indicators of compromise.
