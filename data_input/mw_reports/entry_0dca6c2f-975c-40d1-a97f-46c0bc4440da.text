Taurus Loader: User-Guided Infection

In recent months we have seen a spike in events associated with Taurus loader. Although
Taurus has already been covered extensively by researchers, we think its spreading method
was left untouched by the security community. This method allows this malware to generate
new samples and infect new devices continuously.

Our research saw Taurus being downloaded using promoted cracked software sites. An
individual trying to download pirated installations, using Google search engine, will discover
sites containing this informative GIF:

It will instruct the unsuspecting user through the installation process of the illicit software of
his or her choosing. Alas, following this interactive guide will result in an installation of Taurus
loader. This social engineering trick increases the infection rate by allowing even nontechnical users to successfully execute this evasive malware. To top it all, the download page
is protected from bots by captcha, effectively preventing researchers from automatically
extracting Taurus’ payloads.
Another less documented aspect of Taurus is its final payload decryption, which is achieved
using a specially crafted machine code snippet. As detailed in our previous piece, Taurus
uses AutoIt to perform various evasion techniques, and if a machine is deemed “safe” a
payload will be decrypted in memory and executed. Instead of implementing its decryption
algorithm in AutoIt, the malware developers have chosen to write an assembly
implementation of their chosen stream cipher, RC4.
The RC4 encryption routine, as seen in Hex-Ray’s decompiler:
