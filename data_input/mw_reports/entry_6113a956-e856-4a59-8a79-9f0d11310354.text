Exposing initial access broker with ties to Conti

In early September 2021, Threat Analysis Group (TAG) observed a financially motivated
threat actor we refer to as EXOTIC LILY, exploiting a 0day in Microsoft MSHTML (CVE-202140444). Investigating this group's activity, we determined they are an Initial Access Broker
(IAB) who appear to be working with the Russian cyber crime gang known as FIN12
(Mandiant, FireEye) / WIZARD SPIDER (CrowdStrike).
Initial access brokers are the opportunistic locksmiths of the security world, and it’s a full-time
job. These groups specialize in breaching a target in order to open the doors—or the
Windows—to the malicious actor with the highest bid.
EXOTIC LILY is a resourceful, financially motivated group whose activities appear to be
closely linked with data exfiltration and deployment of human-operated ransomware such as
Conti and Diavol. At the peak of EXOTIC LILY’s activity, we estimate they were sending more
than 5,000 emails a day, to as many as 650 targeted organizations globally. Up until
November 2021, the group seemed to be targeting specific industries such as IT,
cybersecurity and healthcare, but as of late we have seen them attacking a wide variety of
organizations and industries, with less specific focus.
We have observed this threat actor deploying tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) that
are traditionally associated with more targeted attacks, like spoofing companies and
employees as a means of gaining trust of a targeted organization through email campaigns
that are believed to be sent by real human operators using little-to-no automation.
Additionally and rather uniquely, they leverage legitimate file-sharing services like
WeTransfer, TransferNow and OneDrive to deliver the payload, further evading detection
mechanisms. This level of human-interaction is rather unusual for cyber crime groups
focused on mass scale operations.

Spoofing Organizations and Identities
EXOTIC LILY’s attack chain has remained relatively consistent throughout the time we’ve
been tracking the group:

One notable technique is the use of domain and identity spoofing as a way of gaining
additional credibility with a targeted organization. In the majority of cases, a spoofed domain
name was identical to a real domain name of an existing organization, with the only
difference being a change of TLD to “.us”, “.co” or “.biz”.
Initially, the group would create entirely fake personas posing as employees of a real
company. That would sometimes consist of creating social media profiles, personal websites
and generating a fake profile picture using a public service to create an AI-generated human
face. In November 2021, the group began to impersonate real company employees by
copying their personal data from social media and business databases such as
RocketReach and CrunchBase.

Using spoofed email accounts, attackers would then send spear phishing emails under the
pretext of a business proposal, such as seeking to outsource a software development project
or an information security service.

Attackers would sometimes engage in further communication with the target by attempting to
schedule a meeting to discuss the project's design or requirements.
At the final stage, the attacker would upload the payload to a public file-sharing service
(TransferNow, TransferXL, WeTransfer or OneDrive) and then use a built-in email notification
feature to share the file with the target, allowing the final email to originate from the email
address of a legitimate file-sharing service and not the attacker’s email, which presents
additional detection challenges.

Human-Operated Phishing at Scale
Further evidence suggests an operator’s responsibilities might include:
customizing the initial “business proposal” templates when first reaching out to a
targeted organization;
handling further communications in order to gain affinity and trust;
uploading malware (acquired from another group) to a file-sharing service prior to
sharing it with the target.
A breakdown of the actor’s communication activity shows the operators are working a fairly
typical 9-to-5 job, with very little activity during the weekends. Distribution of the actor’s
working hours suggest they might be working from a Central or an Eastern Europe timezone.

Malware and Attribution
Although the group came to our attention initially due to its use of documents containing an
exploit for CVE-2021-40444, they later switched to the delivery of ISO files with hidden
BazarLoader DLLs and LNK shortcuts. These samples have some indicators that suggest
they were custom-built to be used by the group. For example, metadata embedded in the
LNK shortcuts shows that a number of fields, such as the “Machine Identifier” and “Drive
Serial Number” were shared with BazarLoader ISOs distributed via other means, however
other fields such as the command line arguments were unique for samples distributed by
EXOTIC LILY.

In March, the group continued delivering ISO files, but with a DLL containing a custom loader
which is a more advanced variant of a first-stage payload previously seen during CVE-202140444 exploitation. The loader can be recognized by its use of a unique user-agent
“bumblebee” which both variants share. The malware, hence dubbed BUMBLEBEE, uses
WMI to collect various system details such as OS version, user name and domain name,
which are then exfiltrated in JSON format to a C2. In response, it expects to receive one of
the several supported “tasks”, which include execution of shellcode, dropping and running
executable files. At the time of the analysis, BUMBLEBEE was observed to fetch Cobalt
Strike payloads.This malware can be found using this VirusTotal query.

EXOTIC LILY activities overlap with a group tracked as DEV-0413 (Microsoft) and were also
described by Abnormal in their recent post. Earlier reports of attacks exploiting CVE-202140444 (by Microsoft and other members of the security community) have also indicated
overlaps between domains involved in the delivery chain of an exploit and infrastructure used
for BazarLoader and Trickbot distribution.
We believe the shift to deliver BazarLoader, along with some other indicators such as a
unique Cobalt Strike profile (described by RiskIQ) further confirms the existence of a
relationship between EXOTIC LILY and actions of a Russian cyber crime group tracked as
WIZARD SPIDER (CrowdStrike), FIN12 (Mandiant, FireEye) and DEV-0193 (Microsoft).
While the nature of those relationships remains unclear, EXOTIC LILY seems to operate as a
separate entity, focusing on acquiring initial access through email campaigns, with follow-up
activities that include deployment of Conti and Diavol ransomware, which are performed by a
different set of actors.

Improving User Protection
As part of our efforts to combat serious threat actors, we use results of our research to
improve the safety and security of our products. In collaboration with Gmail and Safe
Browsing, we are improving protections by adding additional warnings for emails originating
from website contact forms, better identification of spoofing, and adjusting the reputation of
email file sharing notifications. Additionally, we’re working with Google’s CyberCrime
Investigation Group to share relevant details and indicators with law enforcement.
TAG is committed to sharing our findings as a way of raising awareness with the security
community, and with companies and individuals that might have been targeted or suffered
from this threat actor’s activities. We hope that improved understanding of the group’s tactics
and techniques will enhance threat hunting capability and lead to stronger user protections
across industry.
