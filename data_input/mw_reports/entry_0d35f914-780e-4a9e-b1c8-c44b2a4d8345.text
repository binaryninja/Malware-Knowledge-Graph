TRUSTWAVE SPIDERLABS FACT SHEET

New Vulnerabilities Discovered in
SolarWinds Products by Trustwave SpiderLabs

What Trustwave SpiderLabs Found

Immediate Recommended Protections

• Two security vulnerabilities in SolarWinds Orion Platform
(CVE-2021-25274 and CVE-2021-25275) and one vulnerability
in SolarWinds Serv-U FTP for Windows (CVE-2021-25276).

• Trustwave recommends all SolarWinds Orion Platform and
Serv-U FTP users immediately patch. Fixes are available in the
following versions of SolarWinds products:

• All three vulnerabilities are severe bugs, with the most critical
one in SolarWinds Orion Platform (CVE-2021-25274) allowing
remote code execution with high privileges.
• To the best of Trustwave’s knowledge, none of these identified
vulnerabilities were exploited in the recent SolarWinds attacks
or in any attacks “in the wild”.
• Trustwave reported all three findings to SolarWinds and
patches were released in a very timely manner.
• Full details can be found in our vulnerability blog post.

Why It’s Important
• SolarWinds Orion Platform (CVE-2021-25275): SolarWinds
credentials are stored in an insecure manner that could allow
any local users, despite privileges, to take complete control
over the SOLARWINDS_ORION database. From here, one can
steal information or add a new admin-level user to be used
inside SolarWinds Orion products.
• SolarWinds Orion Platform (CVE-2021-25274): Improper use of
Microsoft Messaging Queue (MSMQ) could allow any remote
unprivileged user the ability to execute any arbitrary code in
the highest privilege.

Planned Future Updates from
Trustwave SpiderLabs
• We have purposely left out specific Proof of Concept (PoC)
code in the full blog post in order to give SolarWinds users
longer to patch. A blog update with PoC code will go live on
Feb. 9.
• PoC code helps information security professionals better
understand these issues and can help them develop
protections or test for vulnerable systems in ways specific to
their environment.

Trustwave Product Protections
• Trustwave vulnerability scanning products can detect these
vulnerabilities and Trustwave IDS/IPS products include
signatures that can detect network exploitation of
CVE-2021-25274.

• SolarWinds Serv-U FTP for Windows (CVE-2021-25276):
Any local user, regardless of privilege, can create a file that can
define a new Serv-U FTP admin account with full access to the
C:\ drive. This account can then be used to log in via FTP and
read or replace any file on the drive.
