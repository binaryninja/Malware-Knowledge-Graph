Introduction
Since 2015, Group-IB has been annually
estimating the size of the Russian video
piracy market.
The figures are as follows:
2015: $32 million
2016: $62 million
2017: $85 million
2018: $87 million
After major pirated content delivery
networks (CDNs) Moonwalk and HDGO
were shut down in 2019, the market
dropped to $63.5 million. It is now
rising again, however, due to a second
wave of CDNs.

The economic crisis caused by the pandemic, for which no country
was prepared, has laid bare a number of problems in today’s society. Both developing and developed countries have suffered and
continue to suffer enormous losses. The world’s industries have
been desperately trying to survive and are searching for new
strategies to ensure global stability. Analysts estimate that, over
the next two years, the coronavirus pandemic will strip the world
economy of some $5.5 trillion1. People are losing their health, their
lives, their loved ones, their jobs, their businesses… The situation
is becoming a global disaster whose consequences will be felt for
decades to come. To make matters worse, this is when cybercrime
rears its ugly head.
For more than 17 years, Group-IB has been researching the tactics,
tools, and monetization schemes used by various cybercriminal
groups and individuals whose overall damage to governments
worldwide amounts to billions of dollars. We are acutely aware
of the cyclic nature of this phenomenon. For cybercriminals, any
crisis is a time of prosperity. While for most people financial instability casts aside anything other than survival, criminals raise their
profits by taking vast sums of money out of people’s pockets and
economies. One shadow economy channel is online piracy.
The fight against this disease within the media industry has been
ongoing for some 20 years, but it is only recently that the scale
of the piracy business has escalated to such a colossal extent.
Russian-speaking cybercriminal conglomerates are no longer content with income that comes solely from video content consumers in Russia and other post-Soviet countries. They have started
branching out into international markets, mainly in developing
countries. This gives them opportunities to increase the capitalization of their shadow businesses manifold.
The US media industry — the largest in the world — is also suffering losses because of piracy. The Global Innovation Policy Center
of the US Chamber of Commerce estimates that online piracy
costs the US economy up to $29.2 billion2.
It has become obvious that pirate resources3 have adapted
to pressure from copyright holders. Pirate infrastructures are
resilient to new technologies and certain legal initiatives. Pirates’
main investors are still illegal bookmakers, casinos, and alcohol
suppliers, or in other words: the entire black market, which sponsors camrip groups4, translators, and IT infrastructures for pirated
content.

The shadow economy is not alone to facilitate piracy, however.
The industry has capacities to host and stream videos that are
often bought by pirate platforms from legal hosting services with
impunity. Pirate websites embed video players belonging to one
or several CDNs and monetize the content by showing ads. Users
can freely visit pirate websites, mainly through search engines
or social media. Meanwhile, pirates have been making themselves
increasingly richer by using processing services of banks, which
inadvertently act as accomplices.
Eliminating a single component of the pirate Hydra will not kill it.
It will simply regenerate. The war on it must be waged on all fronts.
This is the only way to cure cyberspace, develop immunity to piracy,
not just in Russia but in international markets too, and stop its outbreaks as soon as possible.

Objectives
The purpose of this report is to deliver a devastating blow to cybercrime: to expose the entire structure of online piracy, to uncover
the key organizations that sponsor this activity and those behind
them.
Group-IB’s report contains confidential data, including information on individuals believed to be behind some of the key piracy
industry players. Copies of this report have been provided to the
Russian Prosecutor General’s Office, Russian and international law
enforcement agencies.
As an international company, Group-IB is calling on the media
industry, on regulating authorities, and on international organizations interested in fighting cybercrime to work together and help
dismantle a business that has been developing for years, draining
blood and cancelling the efforts of copyright holders worldwide.

Executive Summary
Shadow investors in online piracy. As part of their anti-piracy and
brand protection activities, Group-IB specialists used the followthe-money approach to identify who profited from unlawful activity.
They found that illegal casinos and bookmaker companies were
the main beneficiaries and drivers of illicit video streaming services and pirated sports streaming services. The leaders of the
illegal casino market are Welcome Partners and Lucky Partners.

45%
of pirate websites, primarily watched
by the Russians, use the content
provided by Collaps CDN

$21,000+
made by bookmakers with
well‑developed partner
programs per month

Taking advantage of geopolitical tensions. Those behind one
of the most popular CDNs, Collaps, which provides content to 45%
of pirate websites primarily watched by the Russians, are based
in Ukraine which allows them to continue unlawful activity.
Use of Russian banks and international payment systems in criminal schemes. Despite most of their owners residing in Ukraine,
popular online casinos have been using Russian banks to receive
payments as part of their monetization schemes. None of the
banks classify this type of activity as MCC5 7995.
Symbiosis of gambling and pirated online traffic. Next to films and
TV series, sports streaming is becoming a new source of revenue for pirates. The main advertisers in this case are quasi-legal
bookmakers: 1xBet, Melbet, Parimatch, Linebet, Orca88, Bwin, and
others. A streaming service’s average revenue is between 20%
and 40% of the sum lost by the gamblers it attracted (depending
on the partner program). Well-developed partner programs help
bookmakers make more than $21,000 per month (for a website
with an average of 70-80 gamblers attracted daily).

Russian-speaking cybercrime in international markets. After
being blocked in Russia, shadow bookmakers shifted their focus to:
• Latin America (mainly Brazil);
• India;
• Thailand.
Having polished their schemes in Russia (which has traditionally
been used as a testing ground for cybercrime), they started entering markets with similar characteristics: developing countries,
non-English speaking regions, populations with low financial literacy, and countries where sports streaming is highly popular.
This situation resulted in a symbiosis of gambling companies and
pirated content. Since 2015, 1xBet has allegedly sponsored content for 17 TV show voiceover studios (i.e. 80% of major voiceover
studios). 1xBet is one of the main sponsors of illegal distribution
of TV series in the post-Soviet region. What’s more, in 2018 1xBet
started creating content for other countries:
Total releases: over 500.
Total titles covered: over 270.
Distribution by language:
• 100%6 of camrips are in English;
• 14% of camrips are in Spanish;
• 5% of camrips are in other languages (Tamil (predominantly
spoken in India’s South), Portuguese, Thai, Hindi, and others).
Evasion of technical blocking and lawful prosecution. Content
delivery networks (CDNs) play a key role in online piracy. They are
services that aggregate pirated content and optimize its delivery
to the customer. They supply up to 80% of illegal video streaming
services in Russia and other post-Soviet countries.
The characteristics of second-wave CDNs are:
• frequent changes of technical domains and IP pools;
• use of geographically distributed infrastructures;
• duplicate and reserve content delivery channels, which are
usually rented from various Internet service providers.
These measures have made the currently enforced practices stipulated in anti-piracy legislation ineffective.
Exploitation of legal hosting services’ capacities. Group-IB studied the activities of several pirate groups. Analyses of their technical infrastructures revealed that they systematically used capacities belonging to Russian companies.

  One camrip can be in several languages (e.g. in English and dubbed in Spanish).

Having analyzed the number of CDNs utilizing Mnogobyte’s infrastructure, we determined that the company Mnogobyte is likely
to be one of the leaders in providing hosting services for pirate
CDNs.7 A copyright holder’s complaint about pirate services being
hosted by a hosting service will yield no results because unique
links created for each user individually cannot be opened by anyone else. This means that a hosting service whose servers are
used by pirate CDNs has all formal grounds to remove themselves
from handling the matter, absolve themselves from any responsibility, and continue to make money by providing a platform for pirate
businesses.

23%
of 3,100 pirate resources analyzed
during the pandemic posed risks

to dangerous resources in March

In addition, analyses revealed a number of network addresses
that serviced pirate websites and officially belonged to a company
called DDOS-GUARD. The company regularly ensures the operation of services that engage in unlawful activity, thereby essentially
providing tools for committing offences.
Infection of pirated content with malware. The growing number
of online users goes hand in hand with increased fraud and more
criminal groups that operate online. Because of how popular they
are, pirate websites (streaming services, torrent trackers, etc.) act
as platforms for distributing malware and stealing users’ money
and personal data. During the pandemic, Group-IB checked over
3,100 pirated content websites for viruses, vulnerabilities, and
inclusion in blacklists compiled by antivirus providers and search
engines. The analysis revealed that up to 23% of pirate resources
posed risks to users. In March, the number of total visits to dangerous resources amounted to 76.8 million. Most of these resources
were in the .RU domain.

Introduction
to video piracy
CDN service
Moonwalk
was blocked by the anti-piracy groups
BREIN, ACE and MPA in October 2019
after Group-IB`s report was released

The current situation on the online piracy market is developing
against the background of the actively enforced anti-piracy law
and cooperation between copyright holders and popular search
engines.
In addition, the closure of major first-wave pirate CDN services
had a significant impact on the market. After Group-IB’s report
was released, in October 2019 the anti-piracy groups BREIN, ACE,
and MPA took down Moonwalk, the most popular CDN service
at the time. Acting on behalf of these groups, law enforcement
officers disabled the servers — which ensured Moonwalk’s operation — belonging to three Dutch hosting services and two overseas
companies whose servers were physically located in the Netherlands. The shutdown of Moonwalk led to the closure of a major
CDN HDGO, with another provider, Kodik, losing a significant part
of its content. Both used the same infrastructure as Moonwalk.
Under such conditions, the behavior of pirate website administrators is characterized by a desire to eliminate risks by:

1.

2.

Diversifying content sources

Optimizing database provisioning

Many pirate websites use several CDNs at once in case one
of them fails. In addition, CDN aggregators such as Yohoho,
Emblix, Uitools, and others are becoming increasingly popular.
Aggregators track content on all major CDNs and provide their
own video players, which makes it possible to switch CDNs
at the user’s discretion.

Pirate website administrators who are constantly forced
to create new websites due to blocking have a myriad of modules and scripts that help them quickly transfer and recover
databases. To sync pirate databases, they use film IDs
of major specialized portals such as Kinopoisk and IMDB.

3.

4.

Shifting from quality to quantity

Increasing the share of new CDNs
that use Russian infrastructure

Pirates used to put most of their efforts into developing
a small number of websites operated simultaneously. Due
to search engine results being actively blocked and cleared,
however, this tactic is being used less and less often, mainly
by blocked major websites whose owners rely on their audiences’ loyalty despite the need to use blocking evasion tools.
Other webmasters prefer attracting traffic by creating many
identical sites. This way, losing one site will not result in any
significant negative consequences.

network of online pirates in developing countries

The shift in focus to Russian Internet service providers
is connected to three factors: (i) the seizure of the Dutch
servers that hosted Moonwalk, HDGO, and Kodik; (ii) the
availability of Russian services; and (iii) the lack of successful
and tangible legal action against Russian Internet service
providers that offer their capacities to pirate websites.

The current structure of the pirated video market comprises:
1.

Specialized advertising networks (bookmakers, casinos,
alcohol, etc.) that sponsor camrip groups, translators, CDNs,
and pirate websites.
2. CDNs that offer their capacities for video hosting and
streaming. In turn, these capacities are purchased by pirate
platforms from legal hosting services.
3. Pirate websites that embed the players belonging to one
or more CDNs and monetize content by displaying ads to users.
4. Users who visit pirate websites mainly through search engines
and social media.

up to 80%

countries are provided with content

CDNs play a key role in online piracy. These services aggregate
pirated content, optimize its delivery to the end user, and help
video streaming services make money through partner programs.
CDNs provide content to up to 80% of pirate video streaming services in Russia and other post-Soviet countries.
CDNs are not hosting services or communications service providers. Instead, they use server capacities provided by other (legitimate) Internet service providers.

The main problem that copyright holders face when interacting
with CDNs is that their complaints are ignored and their demands
are met on paper only. In particular, many CDNs create links for
specific users or devices using tokens. Moreover, these links often
function for a limited time only. Complaints about such links are
ineffective because the links change regularly, while illegal content
continues to be distributed. CDNs take no measures against violators, thereby encouraging unlawful activity.
Legal hosting services whose servers are used by CDNs usually
refuse to handle the issue and evade responsibility by giving formal
replies that given links are unavailable.
At the moment, the main CDNs are:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Collaps
HDVB
VideoCDN
Kodik
Videoframe
Bazon
Ustore
Alloha
Protonvideo

The specific characteristics of second-wave CDNs are:
• frequent changes of technical domains and IP pools;
• use of geographically distributed infrastructures;
• duplicate and reserve content delivery channels, which are usually rented from various providers.
A number of the largest streaming services (e.g. Hdrezka) have
their own servers designed to store and deliver video content.
In most cases, however, these servers are not used by other
resources since they do not involve partner programs and therefore bring no profit.

Threat of pirate
websites

As they are highly popular, pirate sites (streaming services, torrent trackers, etc.) are convenient platforms for distributing malware and stealing users’ money and personal data. These sites
can be both sources of threats (if their administrators are threat
actors) and targets for other threat actors.

3,100

During the pandemic, Group-IB screened over 3,100 pirated content websites for viruses, vulnerabilities, and inclusion in blacklists
compiled by antivirus software providers and search engines.

pirated content websites were

The resources were divided into three risk categories:

1.

2.

3.

Safe websites

Relatively safe websites

Dangerous websites

Visiting these websites did not entail
any risks to users.

No threats were detected on these
websites. However, analysis revealed
various vulnerabilities that could potentially be used for unlawful activities.
Such vulnerabilities are most often the
result of outdated or hacked software
(e.g. CMS8).

These are websites where various
threats (including malware) were
detected or websites that have been

Most pirate resources use outdated or hacked software as well
as custom-made parts of code, all of which can contain vulnerabilities. The two main reasons for this are a desire to save on the
costs of creating and operating a website and the fact that some
administrators have poor technical skills.
The fact that most dangerous resources are in the .RU domain
also supports this claim. Experienced webmasters tend
to use overseas domains, including offshore ones, to host their
resources. Registering a pirate resource in the .RU domain is easier
for beginners, although it does involve legal risks. At the same time,
these webmasters do not always have the necessary technical
knowledge and tools to ensure that their resources are safe.

Infrastructure
of pirate CDNs

13

Collaps
Collaps is one of the most popular CDNs. We believe that its organizers are from Ukraine. They are also the creators of two large
pirate streaming services, Baskino and Hdrezka. As at late 2019,
45% of pirate streaming services used this CDN.9
The main domain is collaps.org. Video players are placed on thirdlevel technical domains, with formats including *.delivembed.
cc, *.multikland.net, *.ellinagraypel.com, *. iframecdn.club, and
*.apicollaps.
At the moment, access to many of them is restricted. To bypass
blocking, the service promptly generates new technical domains
and regularly changes its IP pool. New domains are created
according to the template api*.(multikland.net|delivembed.cc|ellinagraypel.com) and using the function JavaScript Date.Now().
The content is distributed using technical domains with the formats *.s2w3.space, *.pixars.org, and *.embedcdn.cc. The links were
found between the CDN Collaps and the pirate streaming services
Baskino and Hdrezka.
This assumption is based on the following facts:
1.

The domains collaps.org and baskino.club used to have the
same Google Analytics ID (UA-131285663). At the moment, this
ID is used by more than 50 pirate websites, including bzserial.
online, hd-kino.info, kino-tyr.ru, kinogram.life, and anilive.su.
2. The current domain http://baskino.me has only Collaps and
Hdrezka video players embedded.
3. A person, whose personal details match those of the official
representative of the Baskino website on VKontakte, a social
networking site (https://vk.com/baskino), is mentioned as the
registrar for numerous Hdrezka mirror websites (e.g. hdrezka-ag.com, mrhdrezka.com, betahdrezka.com, myhdrezka.com,
newhdrezka.com, aghdrezka.com, wehdrezka.com, nuhdrezka.
com, instahdrezka.com).

9

	Hereinafter, the share of pirate websites using a particular CDN is shown in relation to the
total number of pirate websites analyzed. One site can use multiple CDNs at once.

HDVB
HDVB is the second most popular CDN. As at late 2019, 38%
of pirate streaming services used this CDN.
Video traffic comes from regularly updated domains: *tesswalton.
pw, *bernardjordan.pw, *elmerwatson.pw, *alfredcurry.pw, *quinnnash.pw, *frankfoley.pw, *rexhammond.pw, *janenoble.pw, *nadiapattel.pw, etc. The domains are generated mainly in the .pw domain
zone according to the template vb{some_number}{random_name_
surname}.pw. It also hosts video players.
The CDN’s domains are regularly blocked by Roskomnadzor
(Russia’s Federal Service for Supervision of Communications,
Information Technology and Mass Media) in accordance with the
procedure established in Article 15.2 of Russian Federal Law No.
149-FZ of July 27, 2006 “On Information, Information Technologies,
and Protection of Information,” which leads to new ones being created constantly. The domains are changed using a script published
on GitHub (https://partnercoll.github.io/actualize.js).

The economics of illegal r esour ces

46

The economics
of illegal resources
As part of their anti-piracy and brand protection activities,
Group-IB specialists used the follow-the-money approach to identify
who profited from unlawful activities.
It was found that illegal casinos and bookmakers were the main
beneficiaries and drivers of illicit video streaming services and pirated
sports video streaming services.
Although other monetization methods exist, online casino and bookmaker partner programs are still the main way to generate income
in the piracy business.
Pirate websites act as advertising platforms designed to attract new
users. In most gambling partner programs, compensation is a percentage of the sum lost by online players.
For the largest partners, other terms can be established according to the CPA (cost per action) model. In this case, compensation
is paid for an agreed list of player actions and does not depend on the
sum lost.
There are usually three kinds of advertising materials:
• partner links;
• promo codes;
• banners.
Partner links and banners are most often used on websites, while
broadcasts and videos contain promo codes and ads of their own
domains.

of the Melbet partner program in the
first month

To keep statistics and track visits, links and banners have unique
IDs (referral codes) that help identify what website a user has come
from. If advertising is embedded into streamed video content, promo
codes are used for the same purpose. To ensure that promo codes
are used during registration, players are offered a small bonus, often
paid by the organizer of the pirate video broadcast (the bonus is later
subtracted from the final compensation for the online player the organizer attracted).

$21,000+

The bonuses mean that it is more profitable for players to register
using referral links or promo codes. Active players, let alone those
addicted to gambling, can have multiple accounts to diversify risks
related to money withdrawal and account blocking.

made by bookmakers with
well‑developed partner
programs per month

The main advertisers in sports streaming are 1xBet, Melbet, Parimatch,
Linebet, Orca88, Bwin, and others. A streaming service’s average
revenue is between 20% and 40% of the sum lost by the players
it attracted (depending on the partner program).
As compensation is dependent on how lucky the online players are,
it is impossible to forecast the revenue for each project. Moreover,
passive income from previously attracted players grows over time.
As part of the Melbet partner program, beginners make $140 in their
first month on average (for resources with over 7,000 subscribers
and more than 14,000 views per day).
Customers who take part in the Melbet program for a long time can
reach revenues of up to $21,000 per month (for resources with
an average of 70-80 players attracted daily).

Statistics:10

Example of revenue from the partner program forum*

Although some partner program participants have high profits,
it should be noted that online casinos and bookmakers often use
schemes to reduce commission sums. For example, regular payments may be delayed or cancelled altogether under various pretexts. Traffic and the number of players attracted may be underreported, as may sums lost by the players. Statistics may be mixed
with fake data simulating frequently winning players. What’s more,
nearly all bookmakers cut the account balances for players who
have considerable profits in the long run. As a result, accounts
belonging to partner program participants may even fall below zero.

General information
A perfect example of actively promoting a gambling brand online
is the history of 1xBet.

Founded:
2007
Website:
1xBet.com

1xBet is a betting company founded in 2006. Mediascope, specialized in media research, estimates that in Q1 2019 1xBet came
third in the top 10 list of advertisers in the online videos segment,
with 2.4% (by comparison, Google topped the list and had 3.3%).
According to the year-end results of 2019, however, the company
did not make it to the list due to active measures against online
gambling. At the moment, various experts estimate that the company is not even on the list of the top 30 advertisers in Russia.
The bookmaker’s primary audience includes residents of developing countries (India, Brazil, Thailand, and post-Soviet countries).
In 2009, Russia passed a law that banned non-certified gambling
organizations. Two years later, the Russian government had claims
against 1xBet for the first time. In 2016, access to the main domain
1xBet.com was restricted in Russia.
To prevent losses, 1xBet took two steps:
1. It expanded its development beyond the post-Soviet region.
2. It took measures to bypass blocking: numerous mirror sites
(over 800) were created and an ad system involving pirate
traffic (voiceover studios, camrip groups) was developed.

Entry into the markets of developing countries
After being blocked in Russia, 1xBet owners shifted their focus to:
• Latin America (primarily Brazil);
• India;
• Thailand.
Like Russia, these regions and countries have the following
characteristics:
1.
2.
3.
4.

They are developing countries.
Their inhabitants are mainly non-English speakers.
Their populations have a low financial literacy.
Sports streaming is highly popular.

Links with piracy in the post-Soviet region
Official advertising services rarely work together with pirate portals. In their license agreements, major aggregators such as Yandex and Google have paragraphs that ban the use of content
without the copyright holder’s consent.
This resulted in a symbiosis of gambling companies and pirate
traffic.
In September 2015, 1xBet, together with the voiceover studio
Baibako team, published their first ever joint release, with their ads
integrated into the video.

Based on the analysis of conversations on specialized forums,
since 2015, 1xBet is likely to have sponsored content for 17 TV show
voiceover studios (i.e. 80% of major voiceover studios).

Collaboration with voiceover studios was based on the following pattern: a voiceover studio would inform an 1xBet advertising
manager about a possibility to produce content and 1xBet would
pay for it. This meant that 1xBet did not participate in content production (did not order any specific content) but sponsored it. Its
collaboration with camrip groups was similar.
Voiceover studies and their representatives searched for digital
copies of content released abroad. The more relevant the content,
the more 1xBet paid for it.

$55
is the average cost of voiceover
services paid by 1xBet for one episode

up to 80%
of pirate resources in post‑Soviet
countries contained 1xBet
advertisements

52

The average cost of voiceover services for one episode amounted
to about $55.11 For a movie already released online, the cost was
$65-$70. 1xBet spent between $5,000 and $8,300 on average
per month on sponsoring voiceover studios and creating camrips
in the post-Soviet region.
If we look at the history of camrips, the average cost of produсing
one camrip amounted to between $400 and $1,000 (depending
on the copy’s quality and the content’s popularity).
As for integrating ads into the pre-rolls of pirate CDNs, collaboration has been ongoing since 2016. As such, 1xBet ads have been
placed on more than 80% of all pirate resources in post-Soviet
countries.
The total number of content items voiced over with 1xBet’s support in post-Soviet countries amounts to over 900 (movies and
TV series).

Beginning of interaction with Koshara/Octopus team

Koshara × 1xBet
Launched together 100 camrips

In February 2019, the group Koshara started acting
as an intermediary between 1xBet and voiceover studios. Around
the same time, this release-group began creating camrips with
hardcoded 1xBet ads for post-Soviet countries.
Koshara still makes its own camrips regardless of 1xBet, which
is why 1xBet ads often appear several times in different versions
of a camrip. The first time is when a voiceover studio edits
an overseas camrip; the second time is when a camrip is created
locally.
In addition to producing content, Koshara commits to distributing
content by placing it on more than eight major torrent tracker
services (including its own website) and uploading it to two CDNs
after the content is released.
Since 1xBet started working with Koshara, over 100 camrips have
been released, which amounts to an average of three per week.

Lucky Partners
& Welcome
Partners
Website:
https://luckypartners.biz/

Foundation
Lucky Partners founded
by Rustam Gilfanov
In 2011,
Lucky Partnerns moved
from Moscow to Kiev due
to Ukraine’s less strict
gambling laws
In 2013,
Lucky Partners started
collaborating with a Ukrainian
entrepreneur

In 2020,
The conflict between Lucky
Partners and Welcome
Partners has lasted for over
six years

54

General information
For a long time, the two partner programs Lucky Partners and Welcome Partners were the main participants involved in the underground online casino market.
According to media reports, Lucky Partners was founded by Rustam Gilfanov. His partner was Sergey Tokarev.12 In 2011, Lucky
Partnerns moved from Moscow to Kiev due to Ukraine’s less strict
gambling laws.13
Welcome Partners was founded by a Ukrainian entrepreneur,
the owner of many Ukrainian online casinos and popular dating
websites.
Lucky Partners started collaborating with the Welcome Partners
leadership in 2013. However, they later had a conflict, which has
been ongoing for over six years.

Business practices
Both partner programs use two types of illegal online casinos:
licensed and non-licensed.
In several countries, including in Europe, laws generally allow for
online casinos to operate. As such, some developers provide
software for online casinos that comply with gambling regulations. In such casinos, winning is possible and winnings are based
on a mathematical algorithm that ensures that the casino always
has some profit. These casinos are considered licensed.
In the case of non-licensed casinos, similar software is installed,
but it is cracked and allows setting arbitrary betting odds, including
in a way that makes winning impossible.
It is worth mentioning that Lucky Partners try to distance themselves from the most well-known casinos, particularly Azino777, but
media outlets have confirmed that this casino is in fact one of their
projects.
Along with online casinos, partner programs are involved in other
gambling-type projects: small Forex brokers and binary options
(a business that deals with bets on currencies and cryptocurrencies, which in general is banned by international payment systems,
Russian law, and the laws of European countries), various lotteries,
and other similar products.
Lucky Partners and Welcome Partners stay away from Fonbet and
1xBet, the leaders of the bookmaker industry. Nevertheless, both
support the gambling industry.

Accepting payments
International payment systems require that almost all
aforementioned types of businesses be registered with a special
transaction code, MCC 7995. This is the code that was blocked
in the US to stop online casino transactions. Violating the MCC
7995 requirement incurs significant fines starting at $25,000 for
each incident.

$25,000+
is a fine for violating the
MCC 7995 requirement

In addition, banks assign MCC codes based on data that
companies themselves provide. To be able to operate in Russia,
online casinos specify other MCC codes. For example, Azino used
the code 6012 (sale of certificates and consulting services as well
as loan payments), while the actual recipient was the company
Victory 777 N.V, which held a Curaçao license.14 In December
2018, the company was placed on the list of entities for which
there is information that they organize and host gambling games
in violation of Russian law. This list is kept by the Russian Federal
Tax Service and includes 42 companies. It was last updated
in August 2019.
To verify payment information, Group-IB specialists used the
website https://affgambler.ru/blacklisted-casinos, which lists the
most popular licensed and non-licensed online casinos.

Analysis suggests that all popular online casinos use exclusively
Russian banks15 to accept payments, despite the fact that the
owners are based in Ukraine. None of the banks use MCC 7995
for this activity even though there are technical solutions that
help automatically check websites connected to the processing
system for illegal content (including related to online casinos).
Such actions by banks are ignored by the international payment
systems Visa and Mastercard and the Russian system Mir, which
runs counter to both the rules of the payment systems themselves
and the provisions of the Central Bank of Russia.
There are almost no international precedents of online casinos
or bookmakers violating MCC 7995. Under the rules of international
payment systems, this type of violation is one of the most serious
ones, second only to payments for child pornography.

In Russia, Visa and Mastercard parent organizations fail
to address the ubiquitous violations. The reason could be their
poor understanding of the scale of online piracy in Russia and
the monetization of this business through the gaming industry.
As such, we have shared this report with the parent organizations
of the payment systems.

Distributing payments
For outgoing financial flows (namely players’ winnings and
commission payouts to webmasters for ads), acquiring banks
usually act as intermediaries. Payouts to webmasters seem
to be carried out through the online bank capitalist.net.

Attracting advertising
Attracting ad traffic to the aforementioned projects is done
in two ways.
The first method is advertising in the webmaster community,
which centers around the forums gofuckbiz.net, maultalk.com, and
armadaboard.com. Community members meet at various offline
events, mainly overseas to avoid the attention of law enforcers.
According to the information available, these forums also belong
to capitalist.net.
The second method involves ads through pirate websites
using specialized advertising agencies. One of such agencies
is Adwise Agency, whose links with Lucky Labs were confirmed
by the media.16 Adwise Agency has been suspected of having
links with illegal online gambling and pirate websites (e.g. Kinogo,
HDRezka, Filmix, Kinoprofi), including by law enforcement agencies.
In February 2020, the Cyber Police of Ukraine searched Adwise
Agency’s offices in relation to the funding of the pirate websites
kinosha.se, kinanema.net, kinoprofi.vip, rezka.ag, and
filmix.co.17

ZeroCDN, which belongs to the Russian company Mnogobyte,
is one of the most popular services used for placing and distributing video content. As at late 2019, the ZeroCDN project infrastructure was used by 38% to 60% of pirate websites.
The following CDNs were found to use ZeroCDN servers:
• V
 ideoCDN (the third most popular CDN, used by up to 33%
of pirate websites);
• Kodik;
• Videoframe;
• Protonvideo.
In addition, ZeroCDN servers are used by some separate
projects, in particular Hdrezka (over 52 million visitors per month)
and Kinogo (more than 35 million visitors per month).
The company’s website mentions that the Mnogobyte network
has direct connections to major Russian communications service providers, including Beeline, MTS, and TransTelecom, as well
as Moscow-based and regional operators. Major Ukrainian communications service providers (Eurotel, Dataline, Datagroup, and
Topnet) and Belarus’ largest telecommunications service provider Beltelecom are also connected to the Mnogobyte network.
What’s more, Mnogobyte is part of several Internet Exchange
Points (MSK-IX, DATA-IX, W-IX, Global-IX).
In 2015, the company launched the ZeroCDN project, the aim
of which was to store and transfer large amounts of media content.
Since 2017, the company has been officially working with the Swiss
solutions provider DigitalOne AG.20

The Russian company DDOS-GUARD provides anti-DDoS and content delivery services. It is also a hosting service provider.22
By Order of the Russian Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media No. 326-FZ of June 26, 2017, the
DDoS-Guard Protection software was registered as an information
security tool in Russia’s Unified Register of Programs for Electronic
Computers and Databases.
Yet the company’s services are used by many illegal resources,
including pirate and fraudulent ones. DDOS-GUARD does not usually respond to any complaints regarding such resources.
The company DDOS-GUARD:
• provides fraudulent websites with its computing capacities,
which are used to operate the websites in question;
• conceals the actual hosting service and obstructs the identification of website owners.
It is of note that the terms and conditions of using DDOSGUARD’s services stipulate that customers agree to use the
specified services for lawful purposes only. Yet organizing gambling
games and scams falls under unlawful use.23
Despite that, DDOS-GUARD does not comply with its own
terms and conditions of using their services. Under Articles
15.1 to 15.6-1 of Russian Federal Law No. 149-FZ of July 27, 2006
“On Information, Information Technologies, and Protection
of Information,” access to many websites that distribute illegal information and that are or have been hosted on DDOSGUARD’s network addresses is restricted by Roskomnadzor (Russia’s Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media). At the same time, the specified
procedure before blocking provides for the mandatory notification
of violation to the hosting provider, indicating the need to remove
unlawful information. Thus, DDOS-GUARD knew about the violations on the blocked websites, but did not take any actions.
As at June 24, 2020, a total of 453 such resources (domains
or URL addresses) were blocked. These include:
• 6
 resources with network addresses in the subnetwork
185.129.100.0/24;
• 5 resources with network addresses in the subnetwork
185.129.102.0/24;
• 442 resources with network addresses in the subnetwork
185.178.208.0/24.

Legal information
Online casinos

The activities of online casinos are regulated by Russian Federal
Law No. 244-FZ of December 29, 2006 “On the State Regulation
of Activities Involving the Organization and Conduct of Gambling
and on the Introduction of Amendments to Certain Legislative
Acts of the Russian Federation.”
Requirements for gambling game organizers are laid down in Article
6. For instance, only legal entities duly registered according to the
established procedure within the territory of the Russian Federation can organize gambling games. In turn, only legal entities that
are part of a self-regulatory organization of gambling game organizers at bookmakers or a self-regulatory organization of gambling
game organizers at betting houses can organize gambling games
at bookmakers or betting houses.
Article 5 of this law sets out restrictions on organizing and conducting gambling games, including a ban on such activity when
it involves information and telecommunications networks, including
the Internet, and also when it involves means of communication,
including mobile communication (with the exception of instances
of accepting interactive bets and payouts on them by organizers
of gambling games at bookmakers and (or) betting houses).
Failure to comply with the above requirements incurs various types
of liability.
Article 171.2 of the Russian Criminal Code provides for criminal
liability for natural persons who illegally organize and conduct gambling games, including by using information and telecommunications networks, including the Internet, or means of communication.
Under Article 14.1.1, paragraph 1, the same actions carried out
by legal entities incur administrative liability and are punishable
by a fine between 800,000 rubles ($11,350) and 1.5 million rubles
($21,300), including confiscation of the gaming equipment.
In addition, gambling websites may be subject to restriction
of access within the territory of the Russian Federation.
According to paragraph 1 of the Regulation No. 228 of the
Government of the Russian Federation of March 16, 2009 “On the
Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information
Technology, and Mass Media,” Roskomnadzor is an executive body
that supervises the media, mass communication, information
technology, and communications.
As such, Roskomnadzor takes measures to restrict access
to websites that contain information whose distribution in Russia
is prohibited according to the procedure established in Article
15.1 of Russian Federal Law No. 149-FZ “On Information, Information Technologies, and Protection of Information.”
In particular, paragraph 5 of this Article allows for non-judicial
restriction of access to information that violates Russian Federal
Law No. 244-FZ of December 29, 2006 “On the State Regulation
of Activities Involving the Organization and Conduct of Gambling

Games and on the Introduction of Amendments to Certain Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation” and Russian Federal Law
No. 138-FZ of November 11, 2003 “On Lotteries,” which bans the
organization and conduct of gambling games and lotteries that
involve the Internet and other means of communication.
Pursuant to subparagraph a) of paragraph 5 of Decision-making
rules for federal executive bodies authorized by the Government
of the Russian Federation in relation to certain types of information and materials distributed through the Internet whose distribution in the Russian Federation is prohibited (approved by Russian
Government Decree No. 1101 of October 26, 2012 “On the Uniform
Automated Information System the Unified Register of Domain
Names and Website References on the Internet), the basis for
including domain names and website references related to gambling in the Unified Register of prohibited information is a decision
of the Russian Federal Tax Service.

Online pirates

Under Russian law, Internet services that provide servers to CDNs
are considered information intermediaries.
According to Article 1253.1(3) of the Russian Civil Code,
an information intermediary that provides an opportunity to place
materials on the Internet (e.g. a hosting service) does not
bear responsibility for breaches of intellectual rights occurring
as a result of materials being placed by a third party or on the
instruction thereof. However, the responsibility is abrogated only
if the information intermediary meets the following conditions:
1.

They neither knew nor should have known that the use of the
relevant result of intellectual activity or means of personalization in such materials was unlawful.
2. After receving a written complaint by the copyright holder
about a breach of intellectual rights with reference to the
website page and/or to the web address where such material
was placed, they took timely measures, which were necessary
and sufficient, to end the breach of the intellectual rights. A list
of the measures deemed necessary and sufficient, and the
procedure for implementing them, may be established by law.
This means that, if an Internet service that provides pirate CDNs
with their server capacities refuses to cooperate with copyright
holders or if the measures taken are insufficient for stopping pirate
activities, the following is possible:
• Civil liability is imposed on the Internet service provider;
• Administrative and criminal liability is imposed on those
responsible;
• Demands to protect intellectual property rights are set
(unrelated to the enforcement of civil liability penalties),
including demands to delete information that violates exclusive
rights or demands to restrict access to such information.
Within the framework of civil law relations, recovery of damages
may be claimed from a party that has unlawfully used the result
of intellectual activity (Article 1252(1)(3) of the Russian Civil Code).
Demands for compensation can also be made (Article 1301 of the
Russian Civil Code).

In addition, depending on the damages, such a party can incur
administrative liability under Article 7.12 of the Russian Code
on Administrative Offences or criminal liability under Article
146 of the Russian Criminal Code. These types of liability can
be applied against the Chief Executive Officer of a company
whose activity has caused damages as a result of the unlawful use
of intellectual property.
As an example, in April 2018 the CEO of HOME-iPTV, Yuri
Moskachev, was sentenced to three years’ suspended imprisonment for an offence under Article 146(3)(v) and (g) of the Russian
Criminal Code. According to the case file, the accused transferred
the signal of the TV Channel Nostalgiya, for which the copyright
holder was NTV Plus, using the TCP/IP protocol without an agreement with the copyright holder. The court later ordered Yuri
Moskachev to pay NTV Plus $180,390.
