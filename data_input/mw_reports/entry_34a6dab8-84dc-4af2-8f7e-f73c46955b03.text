Summary
LockBit Ransomware (a.k.a. ABCD) is yet another ransomware group operating in the RaaS
(Ransomware-as-a-Service) model, following the same architecture as other major threat
groups, like REvil. This threat emerged in September 2019 and is still being improved by its
creators. In June 2021, the LockBit group announced the release of LockBit 2.0, which
included a new website hosted on the deep web, as well as a new feature to encrypt
Windows domains using group policy.
On August 11, 2021, the LockBit ransomware group announced in their deep web forum that
they have infected the global IT consultancy company Accenture.

According to the company Cyble, the attackers have allegedly stolen about 6TB of data, and
are demanding $50M (USD) as ransom. Also, Cyble mentioned that this attack was
supposedly carried out by an insider, however, that has not been verified yet. The IT giant
Accenture has confirmed the attack and also affirmed that the breach had no impact on their
operations or systems.
The period established for Accenture to pay the ransom was August 11, 2021, which has
now passed.

The original deadline for the ransom’s payment has passed, according to LockBit’s website.

However, as I am writing this blog post, the period to pay the ransom was changed to August
12, 2021, at the end of the day.

At this point, it’s unclear how the attack was carried out, or if LockBit really stole sensitive
data from the company. In this threat coverage report, we will briefly show how LockBit
works, describing some features used for anti-analysis.

Threat
LockBit ransomware is developed in both C and Assembly and uses AES + ECC to encrypt
the files. The group operates in the RaaS model, and on their official website hosted on the
deep web, we can find an advertisement trying to attract more affiliates into the scheme.

According to the page, the group is using a custom stealer named “StealBIT” to exfiltrate
data from companies. They have even included a comparison between their service and
other services, like MEGA and pCloud.

The website also includes an encryption speed comparative between LockBit and other
ransomware families, such as Ragnar, REvil, Conti, and others.

Once the sample is executed, the code implements a very simple technique to detect if the
process is being debugged, by checking the NtGlobalFlag value in the Process Environment
Block (PEB) structure. This is usually done to avoid direct calls to the function
CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent or IsDebuggerPresent .

technique.
Also, LockBit verifies if the process is running with Administrator privileges by checking the
return of the API OpenSCManagerA . If it’s not a privileged process, the function will fail,
consequently reaching the ExitProcess call.

The sample also uses a Mutex to verify if there is another instance of LockBit running at the
same time.

Looking at the PE .rdata section, we can see that LockBit attempts to protect some relevant
information by encrypting the strings, which is just a basic protection against detection or
quick analyses.
Furthermore, we can observe that LockBit is using Intel 128-bit XMM registers in the
operations, probably to increase the performance of the code.

LockBit encrypted strings.
The algorithm is straightforward — it decrypts the string by doing a single byte XOR
operation, using the first byte of the string as a key.

It should be possible to decrypt LockBit strings applying the same logic.

In addition, LockBit also executes a series of commands using the API ShellExecuteA to
avoid any restoration of the files in the machine by disabling the system’s recovery mode and
the Windows Shadow Copies.

commands executed by LockBit.
After the files are encrypted, LockBit creates the ransom note in every single directory where
there are encrypted files.

Lastly, the computer’s wallpaper is also changed by the malware, in case encrypting the files
wasn’t enough to catch the victim’s attention.
