Lockbit ransomware operators have released a new version of their
malware, LockBit Green, that also targets cloud-based services.
Lockbit ransomware operators have implemented a new version of their malware, dubbed
LockBit Green, which was designed to include cloud-based services among its targets.
This is the third version of the ransomware developed by the notorious gang, after the
Lockbit Red and Lockbit Black ones. Affiliates to the Lockbit RaaS can obtain LockBit Green
using the builder feature on the LockBit portal.
The release of the new version was confirmed by the vx-underground researchers:

According to the researchers who analyzed the new version, the operators have modified
their ESXI ransomware variant.
Antonio Cocomazzi, a senior threat intelligence researcher from SentinelOne, reported that
the new variant has a significant overlap with the Conti ransomware, whose source code was
leaked months ago.
‚ÄúI conducted an analysis of the sample and found that it has significant overlap (89%
similarity) with the #Conti Ransomware, specifically its v3 version, which the source code
has been leaked several months ago. The commandline flags for LockBit Green are identical
to those of Conti v3, making it a derivative of the original source code.‚Äù explained
Cocomazzi.
The experts pointed out that only a small part of the source code has been modified by
LockBit, including the ransom note which is identical to the one used by the LockBit Black
variant.
The ransom note filename has been changed to ‚Äú!!!-Restore-My-Files-!!!.txt‚Äù.
The availability of the source code of other malware allows operators to create their own
version, improving it, and speeding up the development lifecycle.
‚ÄúThe approach of reusing and adapting the source code of reputable competitors, such as
the now-defunct Conti, helps to lower the cost and time of development allowing
the #RaaS maintainers to maximize their speed of release to attract new affiliates.‚Äù
concludes Cocomazzi.
Prodaft researchers shared Indicators of Compromise for the Lockbit Green variant along
with the Yara rule for its pattern detection.
