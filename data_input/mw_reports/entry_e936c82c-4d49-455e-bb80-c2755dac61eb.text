If you wanted to learn how an organized cybercriminal operation worked, look no further than
the threat group known as Conti. The recent leaks of the group's chat logs have uncovered
an unprecedented wealth of information and insights into how these veteran cybercriminals
organize themselves.
Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) vendors and independent researchers have spent weeks
poring over the Conti leaked chat logs and have uncovered dozens of very significant
findings.
In this blog, I didn't want to duplicate what is already known (too much). I wanted to share
some of the findings that I thought were the most interesting to me. To rapidly get up to
speed on the Conti Leaks, I highly recommend other researchers to read the work in the
following blogs:

I will also recommend to read what other researchers have tweeted about what they found in
the Conti Leaks:

With those out of the way, we can get to the meat of this blog. I cannot emphasize enough
that these leaks are gargantuan and span years of the group's operations. I seem to find
something new every time I take another look at them but now have enough for a blog of my
own.

Reconnaissance
One major discovery in the Conti leaks is that multiple vendors have covered is the existence
of an "OSINT Team" who gathers details on Conti's targets. This team uses multiple
techniques, as well as commercial tools, to find every piece of information about a target that
will support the end goal of domain-wide Conti ransomware deployment. This OSINT Team
also may engage with the targets (HUMINT), posing as marketing or sales people, gathering
details and information about managers, executives, and how the company operates for
exploitation later.

Phishing
It is well-documented that Conti ransomware attacks often begin via a phishing email. The
group has been launching widespread and targeted phishing campaigns for years using a
multitude of tactics. The Conti Leaks also shared some insights into how these phishing
campaigns are orchestrated.

Malware
The Conti Leaks revealed details on how a persistent cybercriminal operation develops its
malware campaigns. The image below (see Fig. 4) highlights how the group works to test
and develop its payloads against common detections systems used by its targets, such as
ESET and Windows Defender.

Like any malware group, Conti needs server and hosting infrastructure to be able to launch
its campaigns. This includes payload staging servers, proxy servers, C2 domains, Virtual
Private Servers (VPS), and remote storage for exfiltrated data.

Tradecraft, Exploits, and 0days
What sets Conti apart from the rest of their peers in the cybercrime ecosystem is that
members of this ransomware group are innovators and quick to leverage newly disclosed
techniques. The Conti Leaks revealed multiple techniques used by Conti that had not been
previously discussed publicly online.

A Cybercrime Empire
Researchers have stated that they believe Conti has up to 150+ members worldwide. If we
do the math, each member is allegedly getting paid on average $2,000 per month which
equals around roughly $300,000 per month in Conti "employee" salaries and roughly
$3,600,000 per year. This is a LOT for a cybercrime group. With this amount of purchasingpower, it is only natural Conti leadership began to wonder about acquisitions and starting
their own forums, carding shops, and even cryptocurrency platforms.

Fig. 12 - Logo of "McDuckGroup" shared to Conti Leaks
Researchers shared screenshots of all the links pasted into the Conti chats. One stood out to
me: a logo with "McDuckGroup" and Scrooge McDuck. While some researchers I collaborate
with theorized this was a ransomware rebrand, I managed to uncover it was the logo for a
carding market currently under development. After Googling "McDuckGroup", a site called
"mcduckgroup[.]shop" popped up as the first result. This is evidently a carding marketing due
to the search bars for BIN numbers, Expiry dates, cardholder names, and addresses.
Currently no data has been loaded onto the site.

Ransomware
A number of other ransomware groups are mentioned in the Conti Leaks. Trellix researchers
highlighted how representatives of NetWalker, MAZE, and LockBit all have a presence in the
Conti chat server. Ryuk, Diavol, REvil, AvosLocker, BlackMatter, and Crylock ransomware
families are all also mentioned in the Conti Leaks.

Closing Comments
The Conti Leaks have provided cybercrime researchers an unparalleled look into how
Russian-speaking organized hacking groups operate. The leaks also supplement the Conti
Playbook that was leaked by a disgruntled member in August 2021. As a community of
cybersecurity researchers, we now know more about the Conti ransomware group than any
other threat group in history.
For the Conti group itself, however, it appears to be business as usual (BAU). Less than one
week after the Conti chats were leaked, new victims were uploaded to the ContiNews
darknet site.

BleepingComputer also reported on hacktivist groups, such as Network Battalion 65 (aka
NB65), are leveraging a modified version of the leaked Conti v3 source code already. The
group has targeted organizations in Russia for retribution over the invasion in Ukraine.

Conti has seemingly recovered from the leaks and might be at the 'too big to fail' stage of
operations. The Russian state is clearly fully aware of Conti's operations and allows them to
operate with impunity. Researchers at Trellix highlighted the group's connections to the
Russian state and how the intelligence services also benefit from Conti's coveted network
access to high-profile organizations around the world.
Lastly, I hope you enjoyed the blog. There are still likely some secrets yet to be revealed in
the Conti Leaks. I appreciate the help and resources shared by researchers online. S/O to
Curated Intel, Trellix, Intel471, Secureworks, The DFIR Report, and researchers such as
@vk_intel, @pancak3lullz, and @c3rb3ru5d3d53c, and many others!
