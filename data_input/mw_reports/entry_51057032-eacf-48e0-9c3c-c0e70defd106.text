On March 4, we detected that the Transmission BitTorrent client installer for OS X was
infected with ransomware, just a few hours after installers were initially posted. We have
named this Ransomware “KeRanger.” The only previous ransomware for OS X we are aware
of is FileCoder, discovered by Kaspersky Lab in 2014. As FileCoder was incomplete at the
time of its discovery, we believe KeRanger is the first fully functional ransomware seen on
the OS X platform.
Attackers infected two installers of Transmission version 2.90 with KeRanger on the morning
of March 4. When we identified the issue, the infected DMG files were still available for
downloading from the Transmission site
(hxxps://download.transmissionbt.com/files/Transmission-2.90[.]dmg) Transmission is an
open source project. It’s possible that Transmission’s official website was compromised and
the files were replaced by re-compiled malicious versions, but we can’t confirm how this
infection occurred.

The KeRanger application was signed with a valid Mac app development certificate;
therefore, it was able to bypass Apple’s Gatekeeper protection. If a user installs the infected
apps, an embedded executable file is run on the system. KeRanger then waits for for three
days before connecting with command and control (C2) servers over the Tor anonymizer
network. The malware then begins encrypting certain types of document and data files on
the system. After completing the encryption process, KeRanger demands that victims pay
one bitcoin (about $400) to a specific address to retrieve their files. Additionally, KeRanger
appears to still be under active development and it seems the malware is also attempting to
encrypt Time Machine backup files to prevent victims from recovering their back-up data.
Palo Alto Networks reported the ransomware issue to the Transmission Project and to Apple
on March 4. Apple has since revoked the abused certificate and updated XProtect antivirus
signature, and Transmission Project has removed the malicious installers from its website.
Palo Alto Networks has also updated URL filtering and Threat Prevention to stop KeRanger
from impacting systems.

Technical Analysis
The two KeRanger infected Transmission installers were signed with a legitimate certificate
issued by Apple. The developer listed this certificate is a Turkish company with the
ID Z7276PX673, which was different from the developer ID used to sign previous versions of
the Transmission installer. In the code signing information, we found that these installers
were generated and signed on the morning of March 4.

Figure 2 Code signing information of KeRanger
The KeRanger infected Transmission installers include an extra file named General.rtf in the
Transmission.app/Contents/Resources directory. It uses an icon that looks like a normal RTF
file but is actually a Mach-O format executable file packed with UPX 3.91. When users click
these infected apps, their bundle executable
Transmission.app/Content/MacOS/Transmission will copy this General.rtf file to
~/Library/kernel_service and execute this “kernel_service” before any user interface
appearing.

Figure 4 KeRanger executes the extra General.rtf file

After unpacking the General.rtf with UPX, we determined that its main behavior is to encrypt
the user’s files and hold them for ransom.
The first time it executes, KeRanger will create three files “.kernel_pid”, “.kernel_time” and
“.kernel_complete” under ~/Library directory and write the current time to “.kernel_time”. It
will then sleep for three days. Note that, in a different sample of KeRanger we discovered,
the malware also sleeps for three days, but also makes requests to the C2 server every five
minutes.

Figure 5 KeRanger sleeps for three days before fully executing
The General.rtf will collect infected Mac’s model name and UUID, upload the information to
one of its C2 servers. These servers’ domains are all sub-domains of onion[.]link or
onion[.]nu, two domains that host servers only accessible over the Tor network.
The executable will keep trying to connect with the C2 server until it respond with two lines of
encoded data. After decoding these two lines using Base64, the first line contains an RSA
public key and the second line is written to files named “README_FOR_DECRYPT.txt.”

Figure 6 Connect with C2 server and get instructions
When we were analyzing the samples, the C2 server returned the data for the
README_FOR_DECRYPT.txt shown in following picture. It asks victims to pay exactly one
bitcoin (currently around $400) through a specific Tor network website to decrypt the files.

The website will then guide victims to buy a bitcoin from somewhere else and transfer to the
attacker at the address of “1PGAUBqHNcwSHYKnpHgzCrPkyxNxvsmEof”.

Figure 8 Tor website to transfer bitcoin and get decryption pack
After connecting to the C2 server and retrieving an encryption key, the executable will
traverse the “/Users” and “/Volumes” directories, encrypt all files under “/Users”, and encrypt
all files under “/Volumes” which have certain file extensions.
There are 300 different extensions specified by the malware, including:
Documents: .doc, .docx, .docm, .dot, .dotm, .ppt, .pptx, .pptm, .pot, .potx, .potm, .pps,
.ppsm, .ppsx, .xls, .xlsx, .xlsm, .xlt, .xltm, .xltx, .txt, .csv, .rtf, .tex
Images: .jpg, .jpeg,
Audio and video: .mp3, .mp4, .avi, .mpg, .wav, .flac
Archives: .zip, .rar., .tar, .gzip
Source code: .cpp, .asp, .csh, .class, .java, .lua
Database: .db, .sql
Email: .eml
Certificate: .pem

Figure 9 Encrypt all files under "/Users" and all specific files under "/Volumes"
KeRanger statically linked an open source encryption library named mbed TLS (formerly
PolarSSL).
As KeRanger encrypts each file (i.e. Test.docx) starts by creating an encrypted version that
uses the .encrypted extension (i.e. Test.docx.encrypted.) To encrypt each file, KeRanger
starts by generating a random number (RN) and encrypts the RN with the RSA key retrieved
from the C2 server using the RSA algorithm. It then stores the encrypted RN at the beginning
of resulting file. Next, it will generate an Initialization Vector (IV) using the original file’s
contents and store the IV inside the resulting file. After that, it will mix the RN and the IV to
generate an AES encryption key. Finally, it will use this AES key to the contents of the
original file and write all encrypted data to the result file.

Figure 10 Encrypt each file’s content by AES
In addition to this behavior, it seems like KeRanger is still under development. There are
some apparent functions named “_create_tcp_socket”, “_execute_cmd” and
“_encrypt_timemachine”. Some of them have been finished but are not used in current

samples. Our analysis suggests the attacker may be trying to develop backdoor functionality
and encrypt Time Machine backup files as well. If these backup files are encrypted, victims
would not be able to recover their damaged files using Time Machine.

Mitigations
We reported the issue to the Transmission Project and to Apple immediately after we
identified it. Apple has since revoked the abused certificate, and Gatekeeper will now block
the malicious installers. Apple has also updated XProtect signatures to cover the family, and
the signature has been automatically updated to all Mac computers now. As of March 5,
Transmission Project has removed the malicious installers from its website.
We have also updated URL filtering and Threat Prevention to stop KeRanger from impacting
Palo Alto Networks customers.

How to Protect Yourself
Users who have directly downloaded Transmission installer from official website after
11:00am PST, March 4, 2016 and before 7:00pm PST, March 5, 2016, may be been infected
by KeRanger. If the Transmission installer was downloaded earlier or downloaded from any
third party websites, we also suggest users perform the following security checks. Users of
older versions of Transmission do not appear to be affected as of now.
We suggest users take the following steps to identify and remove KeRanger holds their files
for ransom:
1. Using either Terminal or Finder, check whether
/Applications/Transmission.app/Contents/Resources/ General.rtf or
/Volumes/Transmission/Transmission.app/Contents/Resources/ General.rtf exist. If any
of these exist, the Transmission application is infected and we suggest deleting this
version of Transmission.

2. Using “Activity Monitor” preinstalled in OS X, check whether any process named
“kernel_service” is running. If so, double check the process, choose the “Open Files
and Ports” and check whether there is a file name like
“/Users/<username>/Library/kernel_service” (Figure 12). If so, the process is
KeRanger’s main process. We suggest terminating it with “Quit -> Force Quit”.
3. After these steps, we also recommend users check whether the files “.kernel_pid”,
“.kernel_time”, “.kernel_complete” or “kernel_service” existing in ~/Library directory. If
so, you should delete them.

Figure 12 The malicious "kernel_service" process
Since Apple has revoked the abused certificate and has updated XProtect signatures, if a
user tries to open a known infected version of Transmission, a warning dialog will be shown
that states “Transmission.app will damage your computer. You should move it to the Trash.”
Or “Transmission can’t be opened. You should eject the disk image.” In any case if you see
these warnings, we suggest to follow Apple’s instruction to avoid being affected.
