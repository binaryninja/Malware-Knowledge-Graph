APT REPORT S

OlympicDestroyer is here to
trick the industry
By GReAT on March 8, 2018. 5:00 pm
A couple of days after the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea,
we received information from several partners, on the condition of non-disclosure (T LP:Red), about a
devastating malware attack on the Olympic infrastructure. A quick peek inside the malware revealed a
destructive self-modifying password-stealing self-propagating malicious program, which by any
definition sounds pretty bad.
According to media reports, the organizers of the Pyeongchang Olympics confirmed they were
investigating a cyberattack that temporarily paralyzed IT systems ahead of official opening
ceremonies, shutting down display monitors, killing Wi-Fi, and taking down the Olympics website so
that visitors were unable to print tickets. We also found other attempts to wreak havoc at companies
working closely with the Winter Olympics.

Malware features
Several files related to the cyberattack were uploaded to VirusT otal on the day of the attack and
were quickly picked up by other security researchers. As we were researching this attack, the Cisco
T alos team published a brief description of the malware which T alos got from an undisclosed source.
In their blog T alos highlighted some similarities between the attack, Netya (Expetr/NotPetya) and
BadRabbit (targeted ransomware).
T he T alos publication effectively removed the T LP constraint as the information had now become

public and could be referenced in this way. However, we decided not to jump to conclusions,
especially with regards to attribution, and spent time researching it calmly and methodologically,
while we continued to discover more and more false flags and controversies in the malware.
T he main malware module is a network worm that consists of multiple components, including a
legitimate PsExec tool from SysInternals’ suite, a few credential stealer modules and a wiper. From a
technical perspective, the purpose of the malware is to deliver and start the wiper payload which
attempts to destroy files on the remote network shares over the next 60 minutes. Meanwhile, the
main module collects user passwords from browser and Windows storage and crafts a new
generation of the worm that contains old and freshly collected compromised credentials. T he new
generation of the worm is pushed to accessible local network computers and starts using the PsExec
tool, leveraging the collected credentials and current user privileges.
Once the wiper has run for 60 minutes it cleans Windows event logs, resets backups, deletes shadow
copies from the file system, disables the recovery item in the Windows boot menu, disables all the
services on the system and reboots the computer. T hose files on the network shares that it managed
to wipe within 60 minutes remain destroyed. T he malware doesn’t use any persistence and even
contains protection (also a killswitch) against recurring reinfection. Incidentally, only 1MB of the
remote files are fully overwritten with zeroes; larger files were wiped with just 1K of zeroes in the
header. T he local files are not destroyed and the worm doesn’t wipe itself or its components.

Reconnaissance stage
Several companies have blogged about OlympicDestroyer’s attribution, it’s features and propagation
method, but no one has discovered how exactly it was launched and from where. T hat’s where we
had a little bit more luck.
Since December 2017 security researchers have been seeing samples of MS Office documents in
spearphishing emails related to the Winter Olympics uploaded to VirusT otal. T he documents
contained nothing but slightly formatted gibberish to make it look like the text had an encoding
problem, encouraging the user to press a button to “Enable Content”.

Fig. 2 Sc reenshot of attac hment from a spearphishing email.
When the victim “enables content”, the document starts a cmd.exe with a command line to execute a
PowerShell scriptlet that, in turn, downloads and executes a second stage PowerShell scriptlet and,
eventually, backdoors the system. T he only apparent links between this email campaign and
OlympicDestroyer would have been the target, however, we managed to discover a couple of
connections between this weaponized document and the attack in Pyeongchang which makes us
believe they are related.
For this investigation, our analysts were provided with administrative access to one of the affected
servers located in a hotel based in Pyeongchang county, South Korea. A triage analysis was
conducted on this Windows server system. T he affected company also kindly provided us with the
network connections log from their network gateway. T hanks to this, we confirmed the presence of
malicious traffic to a malicious command and control server at IP 1 31 .2 55.*.* which is located in
Ar ge nt ina . T he infected host established multiple connections to this server on ports from the
following list:
443
4443
8080
8081
8443
8880
Save web pages as PDF w ith PDFmyURL

T he server in Ar ge nt ina was purchased from a reseller company in Bulgaria, which kindly assisted us
in this investigation. T he company shared that the server was purchased from Norway, by a person
using a Protomail account:
Name: S im o n ***
Email: s im o n***@pr o t o nm ail.co m
Last Login Date: 2 01 8-02 -07 1 6 :09
IP Address: 82 .1 02 .*.* (Norway)
Server purchased on: 2 01 7 -1 0-1 0
We were able to further connect this to a suspicious looking domain, with a registration address and
phone number from Sweden:
Domain: m icr o s o f t ******[.]co m
Registration name: Elvis ****
Email: e lvis ***@m ail.co m
Registration date: 2 01 7 -1 1 -2 8
Before getting suspended in December 2017 for failing the ICANN email verification check, the
domain registration was privacy-protected. T his shielded the registration data, except the DNS
servers, which indicate it was purchased via MonoVM, a VPS for a bitcoin provider:
Name Server: monovm.earth.orderbox-dns[.]com

T his email popped up as a contact detail for a small network inside the 89 .2 1 9 .*.* range that is
located in Kaz akhs t an . T his is where the trail ends for now. We apologize for not disclosing the full
information as we would like to avoid random interactions with this contact. Full information has been
provided to law enforcement agencies and customers subscribed to our APT Intel reporting service.
T o manage the server in Argentina, Simon *** used the IP address in Norway (82 .1 02 .*.*) . T his is the
gateway of a VPN service known as No r dVPN (https://nordvpn.com/) that offers privacy-protected
VPN services for bitcoins.
It’s not the first time the name NordVPN has cropped up in this case. We previously saw a
weaponized Word document used in spearphishing emails targeting the Winter Olympics that
contained something that looked like garbage text taken from a binary object (e.g. pagefile or even
raw disk). However, part of the random data included two clearly readable text strings (highlighted
below) that made it into the document (md5: 5ba7 ec869c7 157 efc1e52f5157 7 05867 ) for no obvious
reason:

campaign on the Winter Olympics and the attackers responsible for launching the OlympicDestroyer
worm. In addition, this document includes a PowerShell command that closely resembles the
PowerShell backdoor found in the network of the OlympicDestroyer victim. A comparison of this
code is available below.
T he PowerShell scripts listed below were used in the weaponized documents and as standalone
backdoors. As standalone fileless backdoors, they were built and obfuscated using the same tool.
Both scripts use a similar URL structure and both implement RC4 in PowerShell, as well as using a
secret key passed to the server in base64 via cookies.

Lateral movement
Despite the network worm’s self-replicating feature, the attackers did some manual lateral
movement before starting on the destructive malware. We believe this was done to look for a better
spot to release the worm. T hey seemed to be moving through the network via Psexec and stolen
credentials, opening a default meterpreter port (T CP 4444) and downloading and running a backdoor
(meterpreter). T he attackers also checked the network configuration, potentially searching for servers
attached to multiple networks or VPN links in order to penetrate adjacent networks that could be
linked to the Olympic Committee infrastructure.

One of the hosts in the network of the affected ski resort hotel had Kaspersky Lab’s system watcher
component enabled, which collected quite a few of the artifacts used by the attackers for lateral
movement. According to the telemetry from this host, the attackers entered the system on 6
February, 2018. T hey used three types of PowerShell scriptlets: T CP 4444 port opener, ipconfig
launcher and a downloader.
Based on telemetry we received from one of the hosts, we built a timeline of the attackers’ activity
and a histogram showing when the attackers started executables on the system.

Fig. 5 H istogram with attac ker ac tivity per hour of day
From this we can see that the attackers were mostly busy outside of office hours according to
Korean Standard T ime (UT C+9), perhaps to attract less attention or simply due to their own
timezone.

Worm propagation
OlympicDestroyer is a network worm that collects user credentials with hostnames. New data is
appended to the end of an existing collection. Having multiple samples of the worm from different
networks allows us to reconstruct the path of the worm and find the source of distribution (or at
least its hostname and list of users).
Save web pages as PDF w ith PDFmyURL

Fig. 6 Olympic Destroyer worm propagation
T he diagram above was built based on extracted lists of credentials with hostnames and some
alleged roles of the servers based on respective names. We can see there were at least three
independent launch pads for the worm: Atos.net company, ski resort hotels, and the
Pyeongchang2018.com server.
At some point, samples with a list of credentials were uploaded to VirusT otal where they were found
by security researchers that executed the worm in a sandbox environment and uploaded the new
generation on VirusT otal again. T here are a number of samples on VT that contain credentials from
Save web pages as PDF w ith PDFmyURL

those sandbox machines. Nevertheless, it’s clear the network worm wasn’t started there initially, but
was instead coming from one of the known launch pads.

Victims
Spearphishing emails were used to target the networks of official partners of the Winter Olympics.
T he attackers probably went to the official website to find out the names of the partner companies,
figured out their domain names, collected known email addresses and started bombarding them with
spearphishes.
One of these weaponized documents was uploaded to VT from South Korea on 29 December, 2017
inside an email file (6b7 28d2966194968d12c56f8e3691855). T he sender address imitates the South
Korean NCT C (National Counter-T errorism Center), while the sender’s server IP originates from a
server in Singapore.

T he attackers appear to have got sloppy when they searched for email addresses that ended with
those targeted domains. Using short domain names such as sk.com or kt.com wasn’t a good idea.
T his went unnoticed and a few totally unrelated companies with domain names ending with sk.com
and kt.com received spearphishing emails:
krovy-s k.co m (Wood company in Slovakia)
Save web pages as PDF w ith PDFmyURL

okc-s k.co m (Mining-related company in Canada)
bcel-kt .co m (Finance company in Laos)
kuhlekt .co m (Software company in Australia)
wertprojekt .co m (Real estate company in Germany)
Based on all the evidence we discovered, the following networks seem to have been breached in the
attack:
Software vendor responsible for automation at ski resorts
T wo ski resort hotels in South Korea
IT service provider (Atos.net) headquartered in France
com attached network
Considering the malware was spread as a network worm via Windows network shares, collateral
damage was inevitable. T hrough one of the victims who uploaded the dropper file to VT from
Austria, we were able to extract the hostname from the stolen credentials stored in the malware:
AT VIES 2BQA. While it may look like a random sequence of characters at first glance, we speculate
that AT stands for the host country code (Aus t r ia ) which matches the submitter source country,
followed by the organization name “VIES” with some extra random characters uniquely identifying the
host. According to OSINT , there is only one large organization that matches this name in Austria – the
VAT Inf o r m at io n Exchange S y s t e m used throughout the European Union. VIES is a search
engine owned by the European Commission. So, it’s either a compromised host of Atos which role is
to communicate with the Austrian VIES or the Austrian VIES indeed is indeed in collateral damage of
the malware’s network propagation.
But the main outbreak of the worm that we investigated was at a hotel in a South Korean winter
resort. T he hotel didn´t upload any samples to VT , which is why it remained unknown. We assume
many other companies attacked in South Korea did the same, which reduced the visible surface of
the attacked infrastructure.
While we cannot name the hotel chain, we can say that one of its hotels located in a ski resort in
Pyeongchang was subjected to an attack. Despite the close proximity to the Olympic Games, the
resort was not one of the official winter parks staging the games. However, it is definitely part of the
surrounding infrastructure that hosted numerous guests and possibly even sports teams competing
at the Olympics. In an interview with the owners, we found out that the malware disabled ski gates
Save web pages as PDF w ith PDFmyURL

and ski lifts that were operated from one of the attacked servers. Our analysis showed that this was
not collateral damage. T he attackers deliberately chose to start the spread of the destructive worm
from this dedicated ski resort automation server. T hat server was the so-called patient-zero in the
network. T he timing was also chosen to precede the official opening ceremony by a couple of hours,
allowing the worm to propagate deep enough into networks to cause maximum inconvenience for
those using the affected infrastructure. As a matter of fact, the plan was to let the worm gain better
visibility in the news.

Attribution hell
In their blog the Cisco T alos researchers also pointed out that OlympicDestroyer used similar
techniques to Badrabbit and NotPetya to reset the event log and delete backups. Although the
intention and purpose of both implementations of the techniques are similar, there are many
differences in the code semantics. It’s definitely not copy-pasted code and because the command
lines were publicly discussed on security blogs, these simple techniques became available to anyone
who wants to use them.

Soon after the T alos publication, Israeli company IntezerLabs tweeted that they had found links to
Chinese APT groups.

Fig. 9 Announc ement of c onnec tion to Chinese AP Ts by IntezerLabs on 12 Feb, 2018
IntezerLabs released a blogpost with an analysis of features found using their in-house malware
similarity technology.
A few days later media outlets started publishing articles suggesting potential motives and activities
by Russian APT groups: “Crowdstrike Intelligence said that in November and December of 2017 it had
observed a credential harvesting operation operating in the international sporting sector. At the time
it attributed this operation to Russian hacking group Fancy Bear”…”.
On the other hand, Crowdstrike’s own VP of Intelligence, Adam Meyers, in an interview with the media
said: “T here is no evidence connecting Fancy Bear to the Olympic attack”.
However, a couple of weeks later, the Russian trace was brought up again by the Washington Post,
which claimed that Russian military spies were behind the Winter Olympics attack, citing “two U.S.
officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity”. Unfortunately, such articles based on anonymous
sources contain no verifiable information and bring no real answers – they only spread rumors.

Microsoft’s security team also seems to have been tricked by the malware as their internal detection
was triggered on the potential use of EternalRomance exploit (MS17 -010).

T he day after we released a private report with forensic findings and detailed analysis of this
attribution hell to our APT Intel subscribers (for more information please contact:
intelreports@kaspersky.com), the Cisco T alos team decided to revisit OlympicDestroyer and go
public with a similar review. We сan’t help but agree with this nice write-up with code comparison,
because we came to very similar conclusions.
In addition, T alos researchers noted that the evtchk.txt filename, which the malware used as a
potential false-flag during its operation, was very similar to the filenames (evtdiag.exe, evtsys.exe and
evtchk.bat) used by BlueNoroff/Lazarus in the Bangladesh SWIFT cyberheist in 2016.
Recorded Future decided to not attribute this attack to any actor; however, they claimed that they
found similarities to BlueNoroff/Lazarus LimaCharlie malware loaders that are widely believed to be
North Korean actors.
We can’t dispute that part of the code really does resemble the Lazarus code. T he wiper modules
used in OlympicDestroyer (MD5: 3c0d7 40347 b0362331c882c2dee96dbf) and Bluenoroff (MD5:
5d0ffbc8389f27 b0649696f0ef5b3cfe) used similar code to wipe files.

Fig. 12 Comparison of wiping module (left: Bluenoroff tool; right: Olympic Destroyer)
T here is also a high level of similarity between Lazarus and OlympicDestroyer. T here are modules in
Save web pages as PDF w ith PDFmyURL

both campaigns that used the same technique to decrypt a payload in memory using a secret
password provided via a command line. Lazarus used this in their malware loaders (Recorded Future
also mentions a similarity in malware loader code) to protect their backdoor modules from reverse
engineering as they contained some default C2 information.
Despite the resemblance in the method, there are significant differences in its usage:
1. Lazarus used long and reliable alphanumeric passwords (30+ characters long). OlympicDestroyer
on the contrary used a very simple password: “123”.
2. Lazarus never hardcoded its passwords for protected payloads into the malware body.
OlympicDestroyer on the contrary hardcoded it (there was actually no other way, because the
worm had to spread itself and run fully autonomously). T hat’s why the whole idea of using
password-protected payloads in the network worm looks ridiculous, and we believe it’s unlikely an
actor such as Lazarus would implement techniques like that considering their previous T T Ps.
T he possibility of North Korean involvement looked way off mark, especially since Kim Jong-un’s own
sister attended the opening ceremony in Pyeongchang. According to our forensic findings, the attack
was started immediately before the official opening ceremony on 9 February, 2018.
What we discovered next brought a big shock. Using our own in-house malware similarity system we
have discovered a unique pattern that linked Olympic Destroyer to Lazarus. A combination of certain
code development environment features stored in executable files, known as Rich header, may be
used as a fingerprint identifying the malware authors and their projects in some cases. In case of
Olympic Destroyer wiper sample analyzed by Kaspersky Lab this “fingerprint” gave a 100% match with
previously known Lazarus malware components and zero overlap with any other clean or malicious
file known to date to Kaspersky Lab.
Yet the motives and other inconsistencies with Lazarus T T Ps made some of our researchers
skeptically revisit that rare artefact. With another careful look into these evidence and manual
verification of each feature we discovered that the set of features doesn’t match the actual code. At
that moment it became clear that the set of features was simply forged to perfectly match the
fingerprint used by Lazarus. Considering that this is not very well explored area in malware analysis
and attribution, we decided to share some more information on how we proved in a dedicate
blogpost with some deep technical details.
Save web pages as PDF w ith PDFmyURL

We also noticed that there exists a wiper module with original Rich header and it was uploaded to
VirusT otal from France where one of the victims (Atos) is located. T he compilation timestamp was
2 01 8-02 -09 1 0:4 2 :1 9 which is almost 2 hours after attack in Pyeongchang ski resorts started. It’s
unclear what went wrong but it looks like the attackers rushed to modify the worm’s wiper
component, so that it immediately disabled system services and rebooted the machine instead of
waiting for 60 minutes. T hey seem to wanted immediate results as there were just minutes before
the official opening ceremony started.
Considering all of the above it it now looks like a very sophisticated false flag which was placed inside
the malware intentionally in order to give threat hunter impression that they found a smoking gun
evidence, knocking them of the trail to the accurate attribution.

Conclusions
What conclusions can we draw from this?
It really depends on how clever the attacker behind this campaign is.
If Lazarus was the smartest of all, then they could have crafted a sophisticated false flag that would
be hard to discover, requiring even more sophistication to prove it’s a forgery. However, the level of
researcher sophistication is something that’s difficult for attackers to gauge. T he level of complexity
we’re talking about would definitely reduce reliability and couldn’t guarantee that everything went to
plan. In addition, Lazarus had no rational motive to conduct this attack, not to mention T T Ps that
obviously weren’t theirs.
Speaking of T T Ps, we have seen attackers using NordVPN and MonoVM hosting. Both services are
available for bitcoins, which make them the perfect tool for APT actors. T his and several other T T Ps
have in the past been used by the Sofacy APT group, a widely known Russian-language threat actor. A
year ago we published our research about the Lazarus APT group using false flags in attacks against
banks around the world that pointed to a Russian origin. Was it payback from Russian-speaking
Sofacy or was it someone else trying to frame Sofacy? T he muddied waters of this case mean we are
yet to get a clear answer.

T here are some open questions about the attacker’s motivation in this story. We know that the
attackers had administrative accounts in the affected networks. By deleting backups and destroying
all local data they could have easily devastated the Olympic infrastructure. Instead, they decided to
do some “light” destruction: wiping files on Windows shares, resetting event logs, deleting backups,
disabling Windows services and rebooting systems into an unbootable state. When you add in the
multiple similarities to T T Ps used by other actors and malware, intentional false flags and relatively
good opsec, it merely raises more questions as to the purpose of all this.
As we see it, these are some of the possible motives behind the attack:
1. Demonstration of power/skills in the context of a secret communication that we’re unaware of.
T he potential for full-blown, highly destructive cybersabotage might be a strong argument in topsecret political negotiations.
2. T esting of destructive worm capability, but with lower impact to avoid too much attention from
potential investigators and general public (in case of human error or operational failure).
3. T rap threat intel researchers in a field of false flags and, based on their responses, learn how to
implement the perfect false flag.
T he last option makes sense when you consider that the malware contained a wiper that wasn’t used
to wipe its own components – the authors wanted it to be discovered.
For a powerful attacker learning how to reliably craft false flags and trick researchers into attributing
the attack to someone else can mean gaining the ultimate cover – total immunity against attribution.
But this kind of rocket science requires real-life experiments.
We think the carefully orchestrated OlympicDestroyer campaign played a very important role that will
shape APT research in the future. While it didn’t fully sabotage the Winter Olympic games in
Pyeongchang, its effects were noticed not only in South Korea but also in Europe. Most importantly, it
brings with it a potential threat to the attribution process, undermining trust in intel research findings.
T here’s a lesson to be taken from this attack that’s useful for all of us in threat intelligence – don’t
rush with attribution. T his is a very delicate subject that should be handled with great care. We as an
industry shouldn’t sacrifice the accuracy of our research to opportunistically promote business.
