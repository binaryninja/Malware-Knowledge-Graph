BlackMatter Ransomware: In-Depth Analysis &
Recommendations
varonis.com/blog/blackmatter-ransomware/

Executive Summary
CISA has issued a security bulletin regarding the BlackMatter 'big game hunter' ransomware
group following a sharp increase in cases targeting U.S. businesses. To mitigate these
attacks, it is recommended that organizations employ multifactor authentication (MFA) as
well as updating vulnerable software and systems, such as those that are commonly
exploited by ransomware groups.

Background
Over the July 4th holiday, REvil attacked Kaseya's customers using a Sodinokibi payload
that, amongst its many indicators of compromise (IOC), included a "Blacklivesmatter" registry
entry.
Not long after, REvil seemingly disappeared from the dark web, potentially in an attempt to
avoid law enforcement attention or as the result of some take down action.
Aside from being an interesting indicator of compromise (IOC) at the time, the
"Blacklivesmatter" registry entry seemingly provides an early indication of things to come,
namely the formation of a big game hunter ransomware group using the moniker,
"BlackMatter," that, based on our research, appears to be an amalgamation of REvil and
Darkside's team members and tradecraft. The groups exhibit strong similarities in their
codebases, infrastructure configuration, techniques, and operating philosophies.

1/10

REvil and Darkside, as we know, have been two of the most prolific ransomware groups
throughout 2020 and 2021, with landmark attacks on Colonial Pipeline and JBS as well as
the infamous Travelex incident that saw the organization and their customers suffering
disruption for months.

Targets
While mainly targeting Windows based systems, we have observed unique payloads
targeting Linux systems, as well. Linux payloads don't encrypt data; they act as remote
access trojans (RATs) to pivot to other windows-based machines.
Since forming BlackMatter in mid-July 2021, the group's first foray seemingly targeted a USbased architecture company in, or around, July 28, 2021, some three weeks after the
Kaseya incident.

Figure 1 - Example BlackMatter Ransom Negotiations
BlackMatter offers threat actors and affiliates access to custom configurable binary payloads
for each victim that include unique traits such as a tailored ransom note, often providing
proof of the stolen data, as well as the victim's name and their identifier.

2/10

Based on dark web posts by an identity purporting to be BlackMatter, the group is only
interested in targeting businesses with more than $100M annual revenues and they are
avoiding networks that were previously compromised by Darkside or REvil. To incentivize
others to provide access to new potential victim networks, theoretically appealing to
malicious insider threats as well as initial access operators, the group offers a $100K bounty.
As seen in REvil's recruitment activity during 2020, BlackMatter have provided proof and
reassurances of their ability to pay any would-be affiliate by depositing 4BTC (~$247K) with
the forum.

Figure 2 - BlackMatter Forum Post
Notably, the group appears to target organizations in English-speaking countries (explicitly
listing Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States) although they exclude
healthcare and government institutions, likely to avoid local law enforcement action resulting
from political pressure, especially in the wake of an attack that might be considered an act of
cyber warfare.

3/10

Delivery
Unlike many cyberattacks that rely on phishing to establish a foothold, BlackMatter appears
to gain initial access primarily via the compromise of vulnerable edge devices and the abuse
of corporate credentials obtained from other sources.
While it is possible that some edge cases may see the use of spear-phishing campaigns and
malicious document payloads, leading to the compact ~80kb BlackMatter payload being
dropped or downloaded, this has not been observed in any investigations we have
conducted.
In addition to BlackMatter members exploiting infrastructure vulnerabilities, such as those
found in remote desktop, virtualization and VPN appliances or servers, initial access
operators affiliated with the group will likely bring their own TTP and may favor exploiting
some vulnerabilities over others.
Additionally, the group are thought to make use of credentials obtained from other sources,
such as third-party credential leaks, broad phishing campaigns or purchased from dark web
marketplaces, taking advantage of credential reuse and exploiting organizations that don't
enforce multi-factor authentication on internet-facing services.
In many cases, BlackMatter and their affiliates appear opportunistic, happening on
vulnerable organizations potentially based on their susceptibility to a preferred intrusion
method rather than investing time and effort toward a specific target.
In other cases, it is apparent that BlackMatter has gained an extensive and intimate
knowledge of the victim's infrastructure with victim-specific ransomware configurations,
including tailored process and service names to ensure they are terminated prior to the
encryption phase, as well as an embedded list of high-privilege credential, these credentials
may include domain administrator or service accounts that provide the the ability to access
and encrypt data throughout the network.

What can we say about the payload?
Highly efficient multithreaded executable, written in C, that is only ~80kb in size.
Version 3.0 hides the configuration in different locations, making it harder to extract and
analyze.
To hide execution flow, every function is decoded, loaded to memory, executed and
then purged.
Relies on native Windows cryptography libraries, making the payload much smaller.
Encrypts files using a combination of Salsa20 and 1024-bit RSA keys.
Allows specified file extensions and filenames to be excluded from the encryption
process, often to ensure that Windows will still boot.

4/10

Not specific to BlackMatter and previously used by Darkside and MedusaLocker, a
four-year old ICMLuaUtil COM-based user account control (UAC) bypass impacting
Windows 7 thru 10 is used to elevate privileges (due to it being considered a 'feature'
by Microsoft, no fix will be released).
BlackMatter's configuration allows previously acquired credentials to be specified and
potentially used with the UAC bypass.
Enumerates and deletes shadow copies using the Windows Management
Instrumentation Command-Line (WMIC) utility: IWbemServices::ExecQuery ROOT\CIMV2 : SELECT * FROM Win32_ShadowCopy

Victim ID along with the ransom note filename and encrypted file extension is based on
the MachineGuid value within the Registry
( HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography\MachineGuid ).
The resulting encrypted file extension includes nine mixed-case alphanumeric
characters along with the ransom note being saved on the victim's desktop and to
c:\%extension%-README.txt , both of which may evade some dictionary-based
detection methods.
Encryption process involves reading the target file, renaming it with the new extension,
partially encrypting and re-writing 1024KB of data.
Enumerates Active Directory environments using native LDAP queries, specifically the
built-in computers folder LDAP://CN=Computers to identify potential target machines.
Updates the victim's desktop wallpaper to inform them of the situation:

Figure 3 - BlackMatter Wallpaper
5/10

Sets the Access Control List of encrypted files to "Everyone", granting any and all
users access.
To avoid detection and allow file encryption without interference of security controls,
BlackMatter supports the use of Windows 'safe-mode' with the built-in local
administrator account being enabled and set for automatic sign in along with the runonce Registry key being set to execute the BlackMatter payload.
The victim-specific ransom note advises the victim of both the data encryption and theft,
advising them to install the TOR browser bundle so that the dark web negotiation site can be
accessed.

Figure 4 - Ransom Note
In the past, REvil and Darkside have avoided the encryption of machines identified as being
within countries that are members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), based
on identifying the country code used by victim's keyboard layout.
This, combined with early cybercrime forum posts indicating that only native Russian
speakers are eligible to work with the group provides a strong indication that the founding
members of the group originate and operated from within the region.
Notably, BlackMatter does not appear to perform the same geolocation checks, perhaps in
an attempt to avoid association with the region and their past escapades.

Command and Control
The payload will communicate to command-and-control (C2) infrastructure over HTTPS,
encrypted using AES. The victim sends a beacon including the machine name, OS version
and CPU architecture, OS language, username, domain name, disk sizes, and potential
6/10

encryption keys:

Figure 5 - C2 Communications
This communication was observed as impersonating the following user-agent strings that
may be anomalous in some environments:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1)
Firefox/89.0
Gecko/20100101
Edge/91.0.864.37
Safari/537.36

Payload Configuration
The BlackMatter configuration, seemingly a JSON structure, allows the payload to be tailored
toward a specific victim including:
RSA public key to be used to encrypt the Salsa20 encryption key.
Company victim ID
AES Key to be used during Salsa20 key initialization (used later in file encryption).
Bot malware version, mentioning the payload version.
Odd Crypt Large Files - to further damage large files such as databases.
Need Make Logon - will attempt to authenticate using the mentioned credentials in the
config.
Mount units and crypt - attempt to mount volumes and encrypt them.
Look for network shares and AD resources to attempt and encrypt them as well.
Processes and services exit prior to encryption to ensure maximum impact.
Creating mutex's to avoid detection.
Preparing victim's data and exfiltrating.
Dropping ransom notes post file encryption.
C2 domains to communicate over HTTP or HTTPS.

Recommendations
Enforce MFA wherever possible.
Keep backup plans well maintained and operational.
Employ Patch Management processes on externally facing appliances such as VPN's.
Continuously assess external organization posture while looking for accessible
devices, such as Exchange and vCenter servers.
Rotate users, admins and service accounts passwords while checking continuously for
leaked credentials.
Prepare and practice Incident Response procedures for ransomware attacks.
Block the mentioned servers and IOC's.
