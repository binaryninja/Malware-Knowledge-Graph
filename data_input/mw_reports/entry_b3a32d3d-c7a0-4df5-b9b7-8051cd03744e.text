Throughout 2015, Symantec.cloud has been detecting a stream of emails that have the
Xtreme remote access Trojan (RAT), which we detect as W32.Extrat, as an attachment.
These emails are mainly sent to Colombians who may work in the accounting or finance
departments of various-sized organizations. The people behind the attacks are likely
attempting to gain access to computers where banking transactions are performed, in order
to steal banking credentials.
By examining the global detections from Symantec endpoint products for the past two
months, we can confirm that W32.Extrat infections are more prevalent in Colombia than in
any other region.

We combined email data from Symantec.cloud with telemetry from Symantec endpoint
products to cluster together attack activity. Through our analysis, we identified what appear
to be distinct sets of attackers. Over 2015, at least four main groups have been sending
emails with W32.Extrat attachments in order to compromise Colombia-based targets. We
also found that there are other smaller groups actively distributing this threat in emails.
Similar uses of W32.Extrat have been documented in the past.
Symantec calls the four attack teams Caramel, Cuent, Maga, and Molotos. During our
research, we grouped clusters of activity according to the attackers’ command-and-control
(C&C) domains. It is possible that some of these clusters are actually related to each other.

Table 1. W32.Extrat email subjects per attack group
The email subjects usually have a legal connotation or are related to payments and tax. The
contents of the messages continue with these themes and appear as legitimate emails. One
example email was sent from what appeared to be a compromised email account and its
subject matter was relevant to the recipient organization’s industry.

from a compromised account
It is likely that the various attackers are based in Colombia, as they consistently use
Colombian IP addresses for command and control. All of the attackers use dynamic DNS
domains for their C&C infrastructure. These dynamic DNS domains resolve to IP addresses
that are assigned to internet service providers (ISPs), not hosting facilities.
The lifespan of the IP addresses reflect these findings. The majority of the attackers’
domains change to a new IP address in 24-hour periods, with some lasting from three to
four days.

Mitigation
Attacks targeting the financial departments of businesses are a regular occurrence. The
approaches that the attackers take include emails with malicious attachments, phishing
attacks claiming to be from senior management, and social engineering involving phone
calls. Employees should take the following precautions to prevent these campaigns from
succeeding:
Do not open attachments or click on links in suspicious email messages
Avoid providing any personal information when answering an email
Never enter personal information in a pop-up web page
Keep security software up to date
If you’re uncertain about an email’s legitimacy, contact your internal IT department or
submit the email to Symantec Security Response through this portal.
Protection
A full protection stack helps to defend against these attacks, including Symantec.cloud
email blocking, web gateway security, and endpoint security.
Symantec and Norton products detect the payload of these attacks through the following
detections:
AV
W32.Extrat
IPS
