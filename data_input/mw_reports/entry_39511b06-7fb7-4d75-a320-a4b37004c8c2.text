Conti Ransomware Group Diaries, Part II: The Office
krebsonsecurity.com/2022/03/conti-ransomware-group-diaries-part-ii-the-office/

Earlier this week, a Ukrainian security researcher leaked almost two years’ worth of internal
chat logs from Conti, one of the more rapacious and ruthless ransomware gangs in
operation today. Tuesday’s story examined how Conti dealt with its own internal breaches
and attacks from private security firms and governments. In Part II of this series we’ll explore
what it’s like to work for Conti, as described by the Conti employees themselves.

The Conti group’s chats reveal a great deal about its internal structure and hierarchy. Conti
maintains many of the same business units as a legitimate, small- to medium-sized
enterprise, including a Human Resources department that is in charge of constantly
interviewing potential new hires.
Other Conti departments with their own distinct budgets, staff schedules, and senior
leadership include:
–Coders: Programmers hired to write malicious code, integrate disparate technologies
–Testers: Workers in charge of testing Conti malware against security tools and obfuscating
it
–Administrators: Workers tasked with setting up, tearing down servers, other attack
infrastructure
–Reverse Engineers: Those who can disassemble computer code, study it, find

vulnerabilities or weaknesses
–Penetration Testers/Hackers: Those on the front lines battling against corporate security
teams to steal data, and plant ransomware.
Conti appears to have contracted out much of its spamming operations, or at least there was
no mention of “Spammers” as direct employees. Conti’s leaders seem to have set strict
budgets for each of its organizational units, although it occasionally borrowed funds allocated
for one department to address the pressing cashflow needs of another.
A great many of the more revealing chats concerning Conti’s structure are between “Mango”
— a mid-level Conti manager to whom many other Conti employees report each day — and
“Stern,” a sort of cantankerous taskmaster who can be seen constantly needling the staff for
reports on their work.
In July 2021, Mango told Stern that the group was placing ads on several Russian-language
cybercrime forums to hire more workers. “The salary is $2k in the announcement, but there
are a lot of comments that we are recruiting galley slaves,” Mango wrote. “Of course, we
dispute that and say those who work and bring results can earn more, but there are
examples of coders who work normally and earn $5-$10k salary.”
The Conti chats show the gang primarily kept tabs on the victim bots infected with their
malware via both the Trickbot and Emotet crimeware-as-a-service platforms, and that it
employed dozens of people to continuously test, maintain and expand this infrastructure 24
hours a day, 7 days a week.
Conti members referred to Emotet as “Booz” or “Buza,” and it is evident from reading these
chat logs that Buza had its own stable of more than 50 coders, and likely much of the same
organizational structure as Conti.
According to Mango, as of July 18, 2021 the Conti gang employed 62 people, mostly lowlevel malware coders and software testers. However, Conti’s employee roster appears to
have fluctuated wildly from one month to the next. For example, on multiple occasions the
organization was forced to fire many employees as a security precaution in the wake of its
own internal security breaches.
In May 2021, Stern told Mango he wanted his underlings to hire 100 more “encoders” to work
with the group’s malware before the bulk of the gang returns from their summer vacations in
Crimea. Most of these new hires, Stern says, will join the penetration testing/hacking teams
headed by Conti leaders “Hof” and “Reverse.” Both Hof and Reverse appear to have direct
access to the Emotet crimeware platform.
On July 30, 2021, Mango tells stern the payroll has increased to 87 salaried employees, with
more hires on the way. But trying to accurately gauge the size of the Conti organization is
problematic, in part because cybersecurity experts have long held that Conti is merely a
rebrand of another ransomware strain and affiliate program known as Ryuk.

First spotted in 2018, Ryuk was just as ruthless and mercenary as Conti, and the FBI says
that in the first year of its operation Ryuk earned more than $61 million in ransom payouts.
“Conti is a Targeted version of Ryuk, which comes from Trickbot and Emotet which we’ve
been monitoring for some time,” researchers at Palo Alto Networks wrote about Ryuk last
year. “A heavy focus was put on hospital systems, likely due to the necessity for uptime, as
these systems were overwhelmed with handling the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We
observed initial Ryuk ransom requests ranging from US$600,000 to $10 million across
multiple industries.”
On May 14, 2021, Ireland’s Health Service Executive (HSE) suffered a major ransomware
attack at the hands of Conti. The attack would disrupt services at several Irish hospitals, and
resulted in the near complete shutdown of the HSE’s national and local networks, forcing the
cancellation of many outpatient clinics and healthcare services. It took the HSE until Sept.
21, 2021 to fully restore all of its systems from the attack, at an estimated cost of more than
$600 million.
It remains unclear from reading these chats how many of Conti’s staff understood how much
of the organization’s operations overlapped with that of Ryuk. Lawrence Abrams at
Bleeping Computer pointed to an October 2020 Conti chat in which the Emotet
representative “Buza” posts a link to a security firm’s analysis of Ryuk’s return.

“Professor,” the nickname chosen by one of Conti’s most senior generals, replies that
indeed Ryuk’s tools, techniques and procedures are nearly identical to Conti’s.

4/7

“adf.bat — this is my fucking batch file,” Professor writes, evidently surprised at having read
the analysis and spotting his own code being re-used in high-profile ransomware attacks by
Ryuk.
“Feels like [the] same managers were running both Ryuk and Conti, with a slow migration to
Conti in June 2020,” Abrams wrote on Twitter. “However, based on chats, some affiliates
didn’t know that Ryuk and Conti were run by the same people.”

ATTRITION
Each Conti employee was assigned a specific 5-day workweek, and employee schedules
were staggered so that some number of staff was always on hand 24/7 to address technical
problems with the botnet, or to respond to ransom negotiations initiated by a victim
organization.
Like countless other organizations, Conti made its payroll on the 1st and 15th of each month,
albeit in the form of Bitcoin deposits. Most employees were paid $1,000 to $2,000 monthly.
However, many employees used the Conti chat room to vent about working days on end
without sleep or breaks, while upper managers ignored their repeated requests for time off.
Indeed, the logs indicate that Conti struggled to maintain a steady number of programmers,
testers and administrators in the face of mostly grueling and repetitive work that didn’t pay
very well (particularly in relation to the earnings of the group’s top leadership). What’s more,
some of the group’s top members were openly being approached to work for competing
ransomware organizations, and the overall morale of the group seemed to fluctuate between
paydays.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the turnover, attrition and burnout rate was quite high for low-level
Conti employees, meaning the group was forced to constantly recruit new talent.
“Our work is generally not difficult, but monotonous, doing the same thing every day,” wrote
“Bentley,” the nickname chosen by the key Conti employee apparently in charge of
“crypting” the group’s malware — ensuring that it goes undetected by all or at least most
antivirus products on the market.
Bentley was addressing a new Conti hire — “Idgo” — telling him about his daily duties.
“Basically, this involves launching files and checking them according to the algorithm,”
Bentley explains to Idgo. “Poll communication with the encoder to receive files and send
reports to him. Also communication with the cryptor to send the tested assembly to the crypt.
Then testing the crypt. If jambs appear at this stage , then sending reports to the cryptor and
working with him. And as a result – the issuance of the finished crypt to the partner.”

Bentley cautioned that this testing of their malware had to be repeated approximately every
four hours to ensure that any new malware detection capability added to Windows Defender
— the built-in antivirus and security service in Windows — won’t interfere with their code.
“Approximately every 4 hours, a new update of Defender databases is released,” Bentley
told Idgo. “You need to work for 8 hours before 20-21 Moscow time. And career
advancement is possible.” Idgo agrees, noting that he’d started working for Conti a year
earlier, as a code tester.

OBSERVATIONS
The logs show the Conti gang is exceedingly good at quickly finding many potential new
ransomware victims, and the records include numerous internal debates within Conti
leadership over how much certain victim companies should be forced to pay. They also show
with terrifying precision how adeptly a large, organized cybercrime group can pivot from a
single compromised PC to completely owning a Fortune 500 company.
As a well-staffed “big game” killing machine, Conti is perhaps unparalleled among
ransomware groups. But the internal chat logs show this group is in serious need of some
workflow management and tracking tools. That’s because time and time again, the Conti
gang lost control over countless bots — all potential sources of ransom revenue that will help
pay employee salaries for months — because of a simple oversight or mistake.

Peppered throughout the leaked Conti chats — roughly several times each week — are
pleadings from various personnel in charge of maintaining the sprawling and constantly
changing digital assets that support the group’s ransomware operation. These messages
invariably relate to past-due invoices for multiple virtual servers, domain registrations and
other cloud-based resources.
On Mar. 1, 2021, a low-level Conti employee named “Carter” says the bitcoin fund used to
pay for VPN subscriptions, antivirus product licenses, new servers and domain registrations
is short $1,240 in Bitcoin.
“Hello, we’re out of bitcoins, four new servers, three vpn subscriptions and 22 renewals are
out,” Carter wrote on Nov. 24, 2021. “Two weeks ahead of renewals for $960 in bitcoin 0.017.
Please send some bitcoins to this wallet, thanks.”
“Forgot to pay for the anchor domain, and as a result, when trying to renew it was abused
and we /probably/ fucked up the bots,” Carter wrote to Stern on Sept. 23, 2020.
As part of the research for this series, KrebsOnSecurity spent many hours reading each day
of Conti’s chat logs going back to September 2020. I wish I could get many of those hours
back: Much of the conversations are mind-numbingly boring chit-chat and shop talk. But
overall, I came away with the impression that Conti is a highly effective — if also remarkably
inefficient — cybercriminal organization.
Some of Conti’s disorganized nature is probably endemic in the cybercrime industry, which is
of course made up of criminals who are likely accustomed to a less regimented lifestyle. But
make no mistake: As ransomware collectives like Conti continue to increase payouts from
victim organizations, there will be increasing pressure on these groups to tighten up their
operations and work more efficiently, professionally and profitably.
“We have all the opportunities and conditions, we just need to be more professional,” Mango
wrote Stern on Aug. 27, 2021. “And we constantly have one or the other: Either we write
nonsense in chats, or we don’t answer patients [victims] for half a day. Naturally, our affiliates
are nervous after that.”
