Key Findings
Proofpoint identified a new cybercriminal threat actor, TA2722.
This group impersonates Philippine health, labor, and customs organizations as well as other entities based in the Philippines.
TA2722 typically targets Shipping/Logistics, Manufacturing, Business Services, Pharmaceutical, and Energy entities, among
others. Geographic targeting includes North America, Europe, and Southeast Asia.
TA2722 distributes Remcos and NanoCore remote access trojans (RATs).

Overview
Proofpoint identified a new and highly active cybercriminal threat actor, TA2722, colloquially referred to by Proofpoint threat researchers
as the Balikbayan Foxes. Throughout 2021, a series of campaigns impersonated multiple Philippine government entities including the
Department of Health, the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA), and the Bureau of Customs. Other related
campaigns masqueraded as the Manila embassy for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and DHL Philippines. The messages were
intended for a variety of industries in North America, Europe, and Southeast Asia, with the top sectors including Shipping, Logistics,
Manufacturing, Business Services, Pharmaceutical, Energy, and Finance.
Proofpoint assesses this actor is targeting organizations directly or indirectly engaged with the Philippine government based on a
continuous pattern of spoofing email addresses and delivering lures designed to impersonate government entities. For example, the
shipping, transportation, and logistics companies would frequently engage with customs officials at ports of call. Additionally, the
manufacturing and energy companies support and maintain large supply chain operations, likely requiring correspondence with both
labor and customs organizations.
All the campaigns distributed either Remcos or NanoCore remote access trojans (RATs). Remcos and NanoCore are typically used for
information gathering, data theft operations, monitoring and control of compromised computers. While the malware’s associated
infrastructure changed over time, the sender emails were reused for a long period of time.
In 2020, Philippine government entities issued multiple alerts warning users of the activity related to lures using themes such as COVID19 infection information in the Philippines and the POEA labor information.

Campaign Details
Proofpoint researchers identified a series of campaigns distributing Remcos and NanoCore RATs masquerading as the Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia (KSA) embassy in Manila and the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) in mid-2021. Upon further
investigation, Proofpoint identified additional, separate campaigns distributing the same malware masquerading as the Philippine
Department of Health and Bureau of Customs.
Proofpoint separated campaigns into two distinct threat activity clusters. In all cases, message lures were in English. They contained
multiple threat distribution mechanisms including:
OneDrive URLs linking to RAR files with embedded UUE files
PDF email attachment with an embedded OneDrive link or other malicious URL leading to compressed executables (.iso files) that
download and run malware
Compressed MS Excel documents containing macros which, if enabled, download malware
Remcos is a commodity remote access tool available for purchase online. NanoCore is also commodity malware and written in .NET by
"Aeonhack". The code is obfuscated with Eazfuscator.NET 3.3. NanoCore RAT is sold on various hack forums. NanoCore includes
many features and plugins. Both Remcos and NanoCore RAT are distributed by numerous cybercrime threat actors with many different
delivery techniques and lures.
Threat Cluster Shahzad73
Proofpoint named the first identified cluster Shahzad73 based on the command and control (C2) domains used by the threat actor:
shahzad73[.]ddns[.]net
shahzad73[.]casacam[.]net
Although Proofpoint began regularly tracking this activity cluster in April 2021, historic data suggests the activity dates as far back as
August 2020. The threat actor generally leverages themes purporting to be labor-related messages, including spoofing the Philippine
Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) and the Saudi Arabian consulate in Manila. Other, less frequent threats observed in
Shahzad73 campaigns were associated with billing/invoice lures. The messages impacted hundreds of customers globally including
entities in the Transportation, Energy, Construction, Manufacturing, Finance, and Business Services industries.
Messages purported to be, for example:

3/9

From: POEA <info1@poea.gov.ph>
Subject: "POEA ADVISORY ON DELISTED AGENCIES."

Figure 1: Email sample purporting to be from Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA).
Additional samples include:
From: "ksa.Consulate manila " <consulate_ksa_emb@gmail.com>
Subject: "Memorandum from the Saudi Embassy"

Figure 2: Email sample purporting to be from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) consulate.
Saudi Arabia is reportedly one of the most popular destinations for the country’s overseas workers, with over one million Filipinos
working there. In May 2021, the Philippines temporarily suspended sending workers to the Kingdom after receiving reports Filipino
workers were being charged for COVID-19 testing and quarantine. Proofpoint identified a campaign spoofing the KSA embassy in
Manila targeting transportation entities, among others, around the same time.

4/9

Most of these messages contain either UUE or RAR attachments ultimately leading to the installation of Remcos remote access trojan
(RAT) or NanoCore RAT. Each campaign featured a dynamic DNS C2 domain containing the keyword shahzad73.
Example attachment file names:
memorandum from the saudi embassy.pdf.uue.rar
Memorandum from the Saudi Embassy.pdf.uue
POEA Memo-Circular No 019-22.pdf.uue
POEA Memo-Circular No 002-06.pdf.exe
poea memo on delisted agencies ! reminder.uue.rar
poea advisory on delisted agencies.pdf.uue

Threat Cluster CPRS
Proofpoint named the second identified threat cluster CPRS based on the actor regularly spoofing the Philippines Bureau of Customs Client Profile Registration System (CPRS) in ongoing campaigns. The identified Remcos RAT campaigns impacted nearly 150
customers globally, with a focus on Shipping and Logistics, Manufacturing, Industry, and Energy sectors.
Proofpoint began tracking this activity cluster in December 2019. The actor appeared to conduct multiple campaigns per month through
October 2020. Activity restarted again in September 2021. Historic data suggests the activity dates as far back as 2018. The threat actor
generally leverages themes purporting to be entities related to the Philippine government, most frequently the Bureau of Customs
CPRS. Other emails masqueraded as the country’s Department of Health distributing COVID-19 information. Other, less frequently
observed threats in related campaigns were associated invoice, shipping, or Finance/Treasury themes.
Messages purported to be, for example:
From: cprs@customs[.]gov[.]ph
Subject: "E-Mail Alert for Status: PROVISIONAL GOODS DECLARATION REFERENCE NO.C-1075027-21"

Figure 3: Email purporting to be a Bureau of Customs declaration.
Other message samples include:
From: COVID-19@doh.gov.ph
Subject: "Covid-19 Data Cases Report in Your Location-The Department of Health (DOH)"

6/9

Figure 4: Message purporting to be COVID-19 information from the Philippine Department of Health.
Example attachment file names:
covid-19 pcr test report checklist.pdf
covid-19 data cases report.pdf
notice to submit.pdf
The emails contain either a OneDrive URL or a PDF attachment with a OneDrive URL leading to the download of a compressed
executable (e.g. Covid-19 Data Report Checklist_pdf.iso) which, if executed, leads to Remcos RAT.
The most recent Remcos configuration is as follows:
C2: cato[.]fingusti[.]club
License: 4E7867F67DE525ADF9F3A74DBEB02869
Version: 2.7.2 Pro
Mutex: nan
use_tls: nan
2020 campaigns included the following Remcos configuration:
C2: remcos[.]got-game[.]org:2265:pass
license: D77341DCD207EB897C3383385A6676C2
version: 2.5.0 Pro
On 27 September 2021, the threat actor appeared to change tactics. Proofpoint researchers observed corporate credential capture
attempts targeting many of the same companies as previously observed Remcos activity. The phishing emails masqueraded as the
Philippines Bureau of Customs CPRS and contained actor-hosted URLs linking to a credential harvesting page.

7/9

Figure 5: Credential capture landing page.
Despite an expansion of TTPs to include credential harvesting campaigns, Proofpoint assesses with high confidence credential capture
activities are likely temporary and the threat actor maintains ongoing high levels of malware distribution activity.

Threat Cluster Overlap
Proofpoint assesses with high confidence the two observed threat clusters are associated with the same threat actor, TA2722. Of note,
both clusters targeted a frequently overlapping set of customers, and shared the same sender IP address. Based on observed
infrastructure, the two clusters share similar hosting providers, netblocks, and registrars. There are also dozens of unrelated domains
that appear to distribute RATs hosted on the same infrastructure.

Additionally, Proofpoint identified a common registration email associated with multiple command and control IPs and domains that
overlapped with the observed activity:
anthony.marshall.1986@gmail[.]com
This email was previously associated with Adwind RAT campaigns reported in 2017.

Conclusion
Proofpoint assesses with high confidence TA2722 is a highly active threat actor leveraging Philippine government themes and targeting
a variety of organizations in Southeast Asia, Europe, and North America. It is likely this threat actor is attempting to gain remote access
to target computers, which could be used for information gathering or to install follow-on malware or engage in business email
compromise (BEC) activity.
