Background and key findings
Transparent Tribe, also known as PROJECTM and MYTHIC LEOPARD, is a highly prolific
group whose activities can be traced as far back as 2013. Proofpoint published a very good
article about them in 2016, and since that day, we have kept an eye on the group. We have
periodically reported their activities through our APT threat intelligence reports, and
subscribers of that service already know that in the last four years, this APT group has
never taken time off. They continue to hit their targets, which typically are Indian military
and government personnel.
The TTPs have remained consistent over the years, and the group has constantly used
certain tools and created new programs for specific campaigns. Their favorite infection
vector is malicious documents with an embedded macro, which seem to be generated with
a custom builder.
Their main malware is a custom .NET RAT publicly known as Crimson RAT, but over the
years, we also have observed the use of other custom .NET malware and a Python-based
RAT known as Peppy.
Over the past year, we have seen this group undergo an evolution, stepping up its activities,
starting massive infection campaigns, developing new tools and strengthening their focus
on Afghanistan.
The summary of our recent investigations will be described in two blogposts. This first
publication will cover the following key points:

1/17

We discovered the Crimson Server component, the C2 used by Transparent Tribe for
managing infected machines and conducting espionage. This tool confirmed most of
our observations on Crimson RAT and helped us to understand the attackers’
perspective.
Transparent Tribe continues to spread Crimson RAT, infecting a large number of
victims in multiple countries, mainly India and Afghanistan.
The USBWorm component is real, and it has been detected on hundreds of systems.
This is malware whose existence was already speculated about years ago, but as far as
we know, it has never been publicly described.
I will be talking more about the TransparentTribe and its tools on GReAT Ideas. Powered

Crimson Server
Crimson is the main tool used by Transparent Tribe for their espionage activities. The tool
is composed of various components, which are used by the attacker for performing
multiple activities on infected machines:
manage remote filesystems
upload or download files
capture screenshots
perform audio surveillance using microphones
record video streams from webcam devices
capture screenshots
steal files from removable media
execute arbitrary commands
record keystrokes
steal passwords saved in browsers
spread across systems by infecting removable media
In the course of our analysis, we spotted a .NET file, identified by our products as Crimson
RAT, but a closer look revealed that it was something different: a server-side implant used
by the attackers to manage the client components.
We found two different server versions, the one being a version that we named “A”,
compiled in 2017, 2018 and 2019, and including a feature for installing the USBWorm
component and executing commands on remote machines. The version that we named “B”
was compiled in 2018 and again at the end of 2019. The existence of two versions confirms
that this software is still under development and the APT group is working to enhance it.
By analysing the .NET binary, we were able to set up a working environment and
communicate with samples previously detected on victims’ machines.
2/17

Crimson Server version “A”
Main panel
The first window is the main panel, which provides a list of infected machines and shows
basic information about the victims’ systems.

Server main panel
Geolocation information is retrieved from a legitimate website using a remote IP address as
the input. The URL used by the server is:
http://ip-api.com/xml/<ip>
At the top, there is a toolbar that can be used for managing the server or starting some
actions on the selected bot. At the bottom, there is an output console with a list of actions
performed by the server in the background. It will display, for example, information about
received and sent commands.
The server uses an embedded configuration specified inside a class named “settings”.
Example of embedded
configuration
The class contains TCP port values,
default file names and installation paths
used by each malware component. The
server does not include any features to
build the other components; they need
to be manually placed in specific
predefined folders. For example, based
on the configuration displayed in the
picture above, the “msclient” must be
placed in “.\tmps\rfaiwaus.exe”.

3/17

This leads us to conclude that the resulting server file was generated by another builder,
which created the executable files, directories and the other files used by the application.
Bot panel
The main features are accessible from the “bot panel”, an interface with twelve tabs, which
can be used to manage a remote system and collect information.
Update module
The first tab is used for checking the client configuration, uploading Crimson components
and executing these on remote system.

Update modules tab
The Crimson framework is composed of seven client components:
Thin Client -> a tiny version of the RAT used for recognizing the victim. The “thin” client
is the most common one; it is usually dropped during the infection process by which
Transparent Tribe is distributed and is most commonly found on OSINT resources. It
contains a limited number of features and can typically be used to:
collect information about infected system
collect screenshots
manage the remote filesystem
download and upload files
get a process list
kill a process
execute a file
4/17

Main Client -> the full-featured RAT. It can handle all “Thin Client” features, but it can
also be used to:
install the other malware components
capture webcam images
eavesdrop using a computer microphone
send messages to the victim
execute commands with COMSPEC and receive the output.
USB Driver -> a USB module component designed for stealing files from removable
drives attached to infected systems.
USB Worm -> this is the USBWorm component developed for stealing files from
removable drives, spread across systems by infecting removable media, and download and
execute the “Thin Client” component from a remote Crimson server.
Pass Logger -> a credential stealer, used for stealing credentials stored in the Chrome,
Firefox and Opera browsers.
KeyLogger -> this is simple malware used for recording keystrokes.
Remover -> this cannot be pushed using the “Update module tab”, but it can be uploaded
to an infected machine automatically using the “Delete User” button. Unfortunately, we did
not acquire that component and we cannot provide a description of it.
Interestingly, Transparent Tribe tries to circumvent certain vendors’ security tools by
configuring the Server to prevent installation of some of the malware components,
specifically the “USB Driver” and the “Pass Logger”, on systems protected with Kaspersky
products. They also prevent installation of the “Pass Logger” on systems protected by
ESET.

protected by Kaspersky products
File Manager & Auto Download tabs
5/17

The file manager allows the attacker to explore the remote file system, execute programs,
download, upload and delete files.

File manager tab
Most of the buttons are self-explanatory. The most interesting ones are “USB Drive” and
“Delete USB”, used for accessing data stolen by the USB Driver and USB Worm
components and the “Auto File Download” feature. This feature opens another window,
which can also be accessed via the second last tab. It allows the attacker to configure the
bot to search files, filter results and upload multiple files.

Auto download tab
6/17

Screen and Webcam monitoring tabs
These tabs are used for managing two simple and powerful features. The first one is
designed for monitoring the remote screen and checking what the user is doing on their
system. The second one can be used for spying on a remote webcam and performing video
surveillance. The attacker can retrieve a single screenshot or start a loop that forces the bot
to continuously send screenshots to the server, generating a live stream of sorts. The
attacker can also configure the RAT component to record the images on the remote system.
Other tabs
The other tabs are used for managing the following features:
Audio surveillance: The malware uses the NAudio library to interact with the
microphone and manage the audio stream. The library is stored server-side and
pushed to the victim’s machine using a special command.
Send message: The attacker can send messages to victims. The bot will display the
messages using a standard message box.
Keylogger: Collects keyboard data. The log includes the process name used by the
victim, and keystrokes. The attacker can save the data or clear the remote cache.
Password Logger: The malware includes a feature to steal browser credentials. The
theft is performed by a specific component that enumerates credentials saved in
various browsers. For each entry, it saves the website URL, the username and the
password.
Process manager: The attacker can obtain a list of running processes and terminate
these by using a specific button.
Command execution: This tab allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on
the remote machine.

Crimson Server version “B”
The other version is quite similar to the previous one. Most noticeably, in this “B” version,
the graphical user interface is different.

Main toolbar version B
“Update USB Worm” is missing from the Update Bot tab, which means that the USB Worm
feature is not available in these versions.
7/17

Update modules tab, version B
This version does not include the check that prevents installation of certain components on
systems protected with Kaspersky products, and the Command execution tab is missing. At
the same position, we find a different tab, used for saving comments about the infected
machine.

Notes

USBWorm
Last January, we started investigating an ongoing campaign launched by Transparent
Tribe to distribute the Crimson malware. The attacks started with malicious Microsoft
Office documents, which were sent to victims using spear-phishing emails.

8/17

Decoy document used in an attack against Indian entities
The documents typically have malicious VBA code embedded, and sometimes protected
with a password, configured to drop an encoded ZIP file which contains a malicious
payload.

9/17

User form with encoded payloads
The macro drops the ZIP file into a new directory created under %ALLUSERPROFILE%
and extracts the archive contents at the same location. The directory name can be different,
depending on the sample:
%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Media-List\tbvrarthsa.zip
%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Media-List\tbvrarthsa.exe

10/17

Snippet of VBA code
The executable file is the Crimson “Thin Client”, which allows the attacker to gain basic
information about the infected machine, collect screenshots, manipulate the file system
and download or upload arbitrary files.
During our analysis, we noticed an interesting sample connected to a Crimson C2 server.
This sample was related to multiple detections, all of these having different file names and
most of them generated from removable devices.
One of the file path name combinations observed was ‘C:\ProgramData\Dacr\macrse.exe’,
also configured in a Crimson “Main Client” sample and used for saving the payload
received from the C2 when invoking the usbwrm command.

11/17

USBWorm file construction function
We concluded that this sample was the USBWorm component mentioned by Proofpoint in
its analysis of the malware.
Based on previous research, we knew that this RAT was able to deploy a module to infect
USB devices, but as far as we know, it had never been publicly described.

USB Worm description
Our analysis has revealed that USBWorm is much more than a USB infector. In fact, it can
be used by the attacker to:
download and execute the Crimson “Thin Client”
infect removable devices with a copy of USBWorm itself
steal files of interest from removable devices (i.e. USB Stealer)
By default, the program behaves as a downloader, infector and USB stealer. Usually, the
component is installed by the Crimson “Main Client”, and when started, it checks if its
execution path is the one specified in the embedded configuration and if the system is
already infected with a Crimson client component. If these conditions are met, it will start
to monitor removable media, and for each of these, the malware will try to infect the device
and steal files of interest.
The infection procedure lists all directories. Then, for each directory, it creates a copy of
itself in the drive root directory using the same directory name and changing the directory
attribute to “hidden”. This results in all the actual directories being hidden and replaced
12/17

with a copy of the malware using the same directory name.
Moreover, USBWorm uses an icon that mimics a Windows directory, tricking the user into
executing the malware when trying to access a directory.
USBWorm icon
This simple trick works very well on default Microsoft Windows
installations, where file extensions are hidden and hidden files are not
visible. The victim will execute the worm every time he tries to access a
directory. Moreover, the malware does not delete the real directories and
executes “explorer.exe” when started, providing the hidden directory path
as argument. The command will open the Explorer window as expected by the user.
The data theft procedure lists all files stored on the device and copies those with an
extension matching a predefined list:
File extensions of interest: .pdf, .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, .pptx, .pps, .ppsx, .txt
If the file is of interest, i.e. if the file extension is on the predefined list, the procedure
checks if a file with the same name already has been stolen. The malware has a text file
with a list of stolen files, which is stored in the malware directory under a name specified in
the embedded configuration.
Of course, this approach is a little buggy, because if the worm finds two different files with
the same name, it will steal only the first one. Anyway, if the file is of interest and is not on
the list of stolen files, it will be copied from the USB to a local directory usually named
“data” or “udata”, although the name could be different.
If the worm is executed from removable media, the behavior is different. In this case, it will
check if the “Thin Client” or the “Main Client” is running on the system. If the system is not
infected, it will connect to a remote Crimson Server and try to use a specific “USBW”
command to download and execute the “Thin Client” component.

13/17

Snippet of code used to build USBW request
The persistence is guaranteed by a method that is called when the program is closing. It
checks if the malware directory exists as specified in an embedded configuration and then
copies the malware executable inside it. It also creates a registry key under
“HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run” to execute the worm
automatically.

USB Worm distribution
During our investigation, we found around two hundred distinct samples related to
Transparent Tribe Crimson components. We used the Kaspersky Security Network (KSN)
to collect some statistics about the victims.
Considering all components detected between June 2019 and June 2020, we found more
than one thousand distinct victims distributed across twenty-seven countries.

14/17

Crimson distribution map
Most of the detections were related to the USB Worm components; and in most of the
countries, the number of events was very low.

Crimson detections – USBWorm vs other components
If we check victims compromised with the other client components, we can find the real
targets.

Top five infected countries from June 2019 to June 2020 – USBWorm
excluded
15/17

The graph includes the highest number of distinct victims, and it shows that Transparent
Tribe maintained a strong focus on Afghanistan during the final part of 2019 and then
started to focus again on Indian users during 2020.
We may speculate that detections in other countries may be related to entities related to
main targets, such as personnel of embassies.

Conclusions
Transparent Tribe continues to show high activity against multiple targets. In the last
twelve months, we observed a broad campaign against military and diplomatic targets,
using extensive infrastructure to support their operations and continuous improvements in
their arsenal. The group continue to invest in their main RAT, Crimson, to perform
intelligence activities and spy on sensitive targets. We do not expect any slowdown from
this group in the near future and we will continue to monitor their activities.
