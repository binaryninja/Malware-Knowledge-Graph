Key Points
BazarBackdoor is the newer preferred stealthy covert malware leveraged for high-value
targets part of the TrickBot group toolkit arsenal. It consists of two components: a
loader and a backdoor.

The Bazar malware group pursues stealthiness via malware signing and only initially
loading minimal malware functionality. Such an approach improves the malware
chance of long-term persistence inside the most secure networks.
Just like professional penetration testers, the crime group behind the BazarBackdoor
employs legitimate penetration software kit Cobalt Strike for post-exploitation for
enumerating and harvesting credentials for network hosts and active directory,
uploading third-party software like "Lasagne" and "BloodHound" as well pivoting
inside the network domain executing Ryuk ransomware.
Advanced Intelligence experts include the relevant defense and hunting mechanisms
such as the YARA signature for BazarBackdoor detection.

BazarBackdoor is the newer preferred stealthy covert malware leveraged for high-value
targets part of the TrickBot group toolkit arsenal. It consists of two components: a loader and
a backdoor. [1]
Loaders are an essential part of any cybercrime campaign. They start the infection chain by
distributing the payload. In essence, they deploy and execute the backdoor from the
command-and-control (C2) layer and plant it on the victim’s machine. But the reality is far
more complicated than that. After all, loaders and backdoors must be able to evade detection
by various security mechanisms. And that is where the malware developers’ focus on
malware stealthiness comes into play.

Just like professional penetration testers, the crime group behind the BazarBackdoor
employs legitimate penetration software kit Cobalt Strike for post-exploitation for
enumerating and harvesting credentials for network hosts and active directory, uploading
third-party software like Lasagne and BloodHound as well pivoting inside the network domain
executing Ryuk ransomware.

Malware Stealthiness as Key Approach

As we learned from our multiple incident response cases, the BazarLoader's strength lies in
its stealthy core component and obfuscation capability. The malware's goal is to plant on the
high-value targets and reach the server currently via the proxy and the domain generation
algorithm on the EmerDNS domain protocol, searching for .bazar domains and resolving the
server via the XOR function of the response IP address.

The malware aimed to be stealthy and only load more advanced functionality via third-party
components such as Cobalt Strike beacons. Such stealthiness allows the crime group to
maintain persistency on the host even if the third-party software gets detected by anti-virus
software.

BazarLoader: Malware Signing

The group behind also takes advantage of certificate signing, evading particular anti-virus
and other software products.

The use of certificate authorities is widespread in the cybercriminal world. Historically it was
frequently a domain of advanced persistent threat groups (APTs). BazarLoader
demonstrates that alarming trend. The usage of certificates exploits the trust of certificate
authorities by using both new and revoked certificates.

While it may be slightly comforting to know that BazarLoader operators use revoked
certificates up to six months after their expiration, they can easily purchase new ones. They
can buy original code signing certificates for anywhere between $295 USD and $1,799 USD.

The screenshot of a product listing by a threat actor selling these certificates illustrates this
below.

It is especially alarming that these certificates available to any cybercriminal are legitimate.
The threat actor uses real corporations' information to register these certificates with major,
widely trusted certificate authorities. Furthermore, as can be seen from the above
screenshot, even fully authenticated domains with EV SSL encryption are available for the
cybercriminals. Such availability underscores the new reality in which even the most secure
certificates should never be blindly trusted. Caution must be exercised every step of the way.

The use of code signing certificates allows Bazar operators to decrease detection rates
significantly. According to the threat actor selling these certificates, their use reduces
detection rates by 30 to 50 percent. Considering the profit margins of Bazar operators, it is
highly likely they will continue buying these certificates. For them, these certificates are an
investment with a high return of investment.

4/12

BazarLoader: Use Of The Blockchain Technology

The ingenious use of blockchain is another smart investment decision by Bazar operators.
This has cost them even less than the code signing certificates. The price of a blockchainbased, takedown resistant domain called the EmerDNS domain is less than 1 Emercoin per
one year. This is less than one US cent.

It should be mentioned, though, that prominent companies use Emercoin blockchain
technology. Deloitte is one example as well as the US government regulation integrity
project. So once again, Bazar operators display an ability to use legitimate services for
nefarious ends.

In particular, they use EmerDNS (.bazar) domains for connections with C2 servers. Because
these domains use blockchain technology, law enforcement, or security, researchers'
discovery does not threaten the cybercriminals' operation. Neither legal takedown nor
sinkhole can disrupt these domains. So the creative use of EmerDNS (.bazar) domains is the
reason this loader is called "BazarLoader."

More recently, the group introduced the domain generation algorithm (DGA) in the EmerDNS
network. While the novelty claim appeared to be impressive, it was discovered that the
algorithm was flawed. [2] The algorithm provided an alternative server communication
channel creating a massive number of name combinations.

The Bazar Malware Infection Chain

The above-mentioned usage of legitimate services by Bazar malware operators is just the tip
of the iceberg. They also used legitimate file-sharing services for malware spreading.

While phishing emails are commonplace in the cybercriminal campaigns, as about 91
percent of cyberattacks start with a phishing email, their particular use by Bazar malware
operators is more sophisticated than usual. Once again, their tendency to turn legitimate
5/12

organizations into unwitting accomplices is on full display, as they use a legitimate and
widely used SendGrid email marketing platform to send out their phishing emails.

After the user has clicked on the phishing email link and landed on the decoy preview page,
the page tries to trick the user into downloading malicious dual-extension executable files
(such as PreviewReport.DOC.exe) by saying that the document preview is unavailable.
These malicious dual-extension executable files are the BazarLoader files signed with
certificates.

After a series of these deobfuscation processes, the encrypted BazarBackdoor is
downloaded and decrypted. After this, the portable executable file header is validated for
decryption. At that point, the infection chain moves to its final stage during which the host is
compromised.

The loader performs process hollowing via two known methods such as process hollowing
and process doppelganging. It injects malicious code into one of the following processes:
cmd, explorer, and svchost. Then it executes its own code in the address space of one of
them. Since the execution is masked under a legitimate process, the loader often evades
some anti-virus detection.

Eventually, a scheduled task with the name such as "StartAd - Ad" is created, the loader
writes itself into the Windows registry, and creates autorun entries. Because of this,
whenever someone logs on to the system, the loader is able to run. And the loader is
protected from discovery in another way: the author of the scheduled task is set as Adobe.
So once again, Bazar malware operators display some use of deception.

From BazarBackdoor to Cobalt Strike Penetration Software Kit

One of the malware operation's notable components is to download and execute the Cobalt
Strike beacons to further access once inside the targeted networks.

Just like professional penetration testers, the crime group behind the BazarBackdoor
employs legitimate penetration software kit Cobalt Strike for post-exploitation for
enumerating and harvesting credentials for network hosts and active directory, uploading
third-party software like Lasagne and BloodHound as well pivoting inside the network domain
executing Ryuk ransomware.

Ryuk Ransomware: BazarBackdoor's Ransomware of Choice

The group behind the malware is also largely responsible for the significant increase of the
Ryuk ransomware lately impacting high-profile organizations all over the world.

8/12

In The Art of War, Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu wrote that all warfare is based on
deception. If so, then Bazar malware operators have turned cybercrime into an art form
hunting for high-value targets and combining the use of legitimate services and its simplicity
into one arcane web of deception.

Prevention

That indicator of compromise is a scheduled task with the name "StartAd – Ad".

Additionally, watch out for dual-extension executable files (such as PreviewReport.DOC.exe).

Users should be careful not to trust revoked certificates. In particular, be on the lookout for
the following revoked certificates used by BazarLoader:
1. VITA-DE d.o.o.
2. VB CORPORATE PTY. LTD.
3. VAS CO PTY LTD
4. THE FLOWER FACTORY S.R.L.
