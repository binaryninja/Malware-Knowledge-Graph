Executive summary
After publishing our initial series of blogposts back in 2016, we have continued to track the
ScarCruft threat actor. ScarCruft is a Korean-speaking and allegedly state-sponsored threat
actor that usually targets organizations and companies with links to the Korean peninsula.
The threat actor is highly skilled and, by all appearances, quite resourceful.
We recently discovered some interesting telemetry on this actor, and decided to dig deeper
into ScarCruft’s recent activity. This shows that the actor is still very active and constantly
trying to elaborate its attack tools. Based on our telemetry, we can reassemble ScarCruft’s

binary infection procedure. It used a multi-stage binary infection to update each module
effectively and evade detection. In addition, we analyzed the victims of this campaign and
spotted an interesting overlap of this campaign with another APT actor known as DarkHotel.

Multi-stage binary infection
The ScarCruft group uses common malware delivery techniques such as spear phishing and
Strategic Web Compromises (SWC). As in Operation Daybreak, this actor performs
sophisticated attacks using a zero-day exploit. However, sometimes using public exploit code
is quicker and more effective for malware authors. We witnessed this actor extensively
testing a known public exploit during its preparation for the next campaign.
In order to deploy an implant for the final payload, ScarCruft uses a multi-stage binary
infection scheme. As a rule, the initial dropper is created by the infection procedure. One of
the most notable functions of the initial dropper is to bypass Windows UAC (User Account
Control) in order to execute the next payload with higher privileges. This malware uses the
public privilege escalation exploit code CVE-2018-8120 or UACME which is normally used
by legitimate red teams. Afterwards, the installer malware creates a downloader and a
configuration file from its resource and executes it. The downloader malware uses the
configuration file and connects to the C2 server to fetch the next payload. In order to evade
network level detection, the downloader uses steganography. The downloaded payload is an
image file, but it contains an appended malicious payload to be decrypted.

The final payload created by the aforementioned process is a well known backdoor, also
known as ROKRAT by Cisco Talos. This cloud service-based backdoor contains many
features. One of its main functions is to steal information. Upon execution, this malware
creates 10 random directory paths and uses them for a specially designated purpose. The
malware creates 11 threads simultaneously: six threads are responsible for stealing
information from the infected host, and five threads are for forwarding collected data to four
cloud services (Box, Dropbox, Pcloud and Yandex). When uploading stolen data to a cloud
service, it uses predefined directory path such as /english, /video or /scriptout.

Cloud-based backdoor

The same malware contains full-featured backdoor functionality. The commands are
downloaded from the /script path of a cloud service provider and the respective execution
results are uploaded to the /scriptout path. It supports the following commands, which are
enough to fully control the infected host:
Get File/Process listing
Download additional payload and execute
Execute Windows command
Update configuration data including cloud service token information
Save screenshot and an audio recording
The ScarCruft group keeps expanding its exfiltration targets to steal further information from
infected hosts and continues to create tools for additional data exfiltration. During our
research, we confirmed that they have an interest in mobile devices.

We also discovered an interesting piece of rare malware created by this threat actor – a
Bluetooth device harvester. This malware is responsible for stealing Bluetooth device
information. It is fetched by a downloader, and collects information directly from the infected
host. This malware uses Windows Bluetooth APIs to find information on connected Bluetooth
devices and saves the following information.
Instance Name: Name of device
Address: Address of device
Class: Class of the device
Connected: Whether the device is connected(true or false)
Authenticated: Whether the device is authenticated(true or false)
Remembered: Whether the device is a remembered device(true or false)
The attackers appear to be increasing the scope of the information collected from victims.

Victimology
We have found several victims of this campaign, based on our telemetry – investment and
trading companies in Vietnam and Russia. We believe they may have some links to North
Korea, which may explain why ScarCruft decided to closely monitor them. ScarCruft also
attacked a diplomatic agency in Hong Kong, and another diplomatic agency in North Korea.
It appears ScarCruft is primarily targeting intelligence for political and diplomatic purposes.

Victimology of this campaign

Overlap with other actors
We discovered one victim from Russia that also triggered a malware detection while staying
in North Korea in the past. The fact that this victim visits North Korea makes its special and
suggests that it may have valuable information about North Korean affairs. ScarCruft infected
this victim on September 21, 2018. But before the ScarCruft infection, however, another APT
group also targeted this victim with the host being infected with GreezeBackdoor on March
26, 2018.
GreezeBackdoor is a tool of the DarkHotel APT group, which we have previously written
about. In addition, this victim was also attacked by the Konni malware on 03 April 2018. The
Konni malware was disguised as a North Korean news item in a weaponized documents (the
name of the document was “Why North Korea slams South Korea’s recent defense talks with
U.S-Japan.zip”)

Infection timeline

This is not the first time we have seen an overlap of ScarCruft and DarkHotel actors.
Members from our team have already presented on the conflict of these two threat actors at
security conferences. We have also shared more details with our threat intelligence
customers in the past. They are both Korean-speaking threat actors and sometimes their
victimology overlaps. But both group seem to have different TTPs (Tactics, Techniques and
Procedures) and it leads us to believe that one group regularly lurks in the other’s shadow.

Conclusions
The ScarCruft has shown itself to be a highly-skilled and active group. It has a keen interest
in North Korean affairs, attacking those in the business sector who may have any connection
to North Korea, as well as diplomatic agencies around the globe. Based on the ScarCruft’s
recent activities, we strongly believe that this group is likely to continue to evolve. For more
