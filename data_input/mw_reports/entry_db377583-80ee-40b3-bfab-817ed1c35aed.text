Already with thousands of victims.

Intro
With Bitcoin on the rise and a market exceeding billions of dollars, cryptocurrency has
attracted threat actors wishing to leverage these capitals for their own financial gain.
In December, we discovered a wide-ranging operation targeting cryptocurrency users,
estimated to have initiated in January 2020. This extensive operation is composed of a fullfledged marketing campaign, custom cryptocurrency-related applications and a new Remote
Access Tool (RAT) written from scratch.

The campaign includes: Domain registrations, websites, trojanized applications, fake social
media accounts and a new undetected remote access trojan that we have named
ElectroRAT. ElectroRAT is written in Golang and compiled to target multiple operating
systems: Windows, Linux and MacOS.
It is rather common to see various information stealers trying to collect private keys to access
victims’ wallets. However, it is rare to see tools written from scratch and used to target
multiple operating systems for these purposes.
The attacker behind this operation has lured cryptocurrency users to download trojanized
applications by promoting them in dedicated online forums and on social media. We estimate
this campaign has already infected thousands of victims—based on the number of unique
visitors to the pastebin pages used to locate the command and control servers.

The Operation
The attacker has created three different trojanized applications, each with a Windows, Linux
and Mac version. The binaries are hosted on websites built specifically for this campaign.

These applications are directly related to cryptocurrency. “Jamm” and “eTrade” are
cryptocurrency trade management applications and “DaoPoker” is a cryptocurrency poker
app. Figures 1 and 2 are the homepages of the “Jamm” and “eTrade” websites. Figure 3
shows what the “eTrade” application looks like once it runs on an Ubuntu desktop.

These applications were promoted in cryptocurrency and blockchain-related forums such as
bitcointalk and SteemCoinPan. The promotional posts, published by fake users, tempted
readers to browse the applications’ web pages, where they could download the application
without knowing they were actually installing malware.Figures 4 and 5 are examples of the
promotions posted in these forums.

The attacker went the extra mile to create Twitter and Telegram personas for the “DaoPoker”
application, in addition to paying a social media influencer for advertisement. Figure 6 shows
the DaoPoker Twitter page. Figure 7 shows eTrade promoted by a social media advertiser
with over 25K followers on Twitter.

Victims of the Operation
As part of its behavioral flow, ElectroRAT contacts raw pastebin pages to retrieve the C&C IP
address. The pastebin pages are published by the same user called “Execmac”. Browsing
the user’s page, we have more visibility into the number of victims subject to this campaign.
In Figure 8, we can see that the amount of unique visitors to the user’s pastes is
approximately 6.5K [at the time of this writing]. We can also see the first pastebin pages were
posted on January 8 2020, which indicates the operation has been active for at least a year.

We also saw evidence of victims who were compromised by these applications commenting
on posts related to MetaMask. See Figures 9 and 10.

Opening a Can of Stealers
The above-mentioned pastebin page reveals more insights. Other pastes published by the
same user contain C&Cs directly tied to Amadey and KPOT. These malware are stealers
mainly purchased on the Dark Web as off-the-shelf malware. ElectroRAT shares similar

functionalities to these well-known trojans, however, it’s written from scratch in Golang. We
assume a reason for this is to target multiple operating systems, since Golang is incredibly
efficient for multi-platform use. Writing the malware from scratch has also allowed the
campaign to fly under the radar for almost a year by evading all Antivirus detections.

Technical Analysis
Jamm, DaoPoker and eTrade were built using Electron, an app building platform. ElectroRAT
is embedded inside each application. Once a victim runs the application, an innocent GUI will
open, while ElectroRat runs hidden in the background as “mdworker”. Figure 3 above shows
eTrade app GUI upon runtime on an infected Ubuntu desktop machine. Figure 11 shows
what the infection looks like behind the scenes using Intezer’s Cloud Workload Protection
Platform, Intezer Protect.

The trojanized application and the ElectroRAT binaries are either low detected or completely
undetected in VirusTotal at the time of this writing. Figure 12 shows the signed DaoPoker
application’s detection rate in VirusTotal.

ElectroRAT is extremely intrusive. It has various capabilities such as keylogging, taking
screenshots, uploading files from disk, downloading files and executing commands on the
victim’s console. The malware has similar capabilities for its Windows, Linux and MacOS
variants.

Detection & Response
Detect if a Machine in Your Network Has Been Compromised
You can quickly detect if your machine, or a machine in your network, has been
compromised by malware using Intezer Protect and Intezer Analyze Endpoint Scanner:

Linux Machines
Linux threats are on the rise. Use Intezer Protect to gain full runtime visibility over the code in
your Linux-based systems and get alerted on any malicious or unauthorized code. We have
a free community edition.
Figure 10 above emphasizes an Intezer Protect alert on a compromised machine. The alert
provides you with full context about the malicious code including threat classification, binary’s
path on the disk, process tree, command and hash.

Windows Machines
Running Intezer’s Endpoint Scanner will provide you with visibility into the type and origin of
all binary code that resides in your machine’s memory. Figure 13 shows an example of an
endpoint infected with ElectroRAT.

Response
If you were, or suspect that you are a victim of this scam, take the following steps:
1. Kill the process and delete all files related to the malware.
2. Make sure your machine is clean and running 100% trusted code using Intezer’s tools
mentioned above.
3. Move your funds to a new wallet.
4. Change all of your passwords.
You can also run this YARA rule against in-memory artifacts to detect ElectroRAT.

Wrap-Up
It is very uncommon to see a RAT written from scratch and used to steal personal
information from cryptocurrency users. It is even more rare to see such a wide-ranging and
targeted campaign that includes various components such as fake apps/websites and
marketing/promotional efforts via relevant forums and social media.

ElectroRAT is the latest example of attackers using Golang to develop multi-platform
malware. We touched upon this trend in the Top Linux Cloud Threats of 2020.
ElectroRAT’s PE and ELF versions are indexed in Intezer Analyze so that you can quickly
classify any samples that are genetically similar.
