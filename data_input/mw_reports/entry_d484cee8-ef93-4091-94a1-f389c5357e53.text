Blackfly: Espionage Group Targets Materials Technology
symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/blackfly-espionage-materials

The Blackfly espionage group (aka APT41, Winnti Group, Bronze Atlas) has continued to
mount attacks against targets in Asia and recently targeted two subsidiaries of an Asian
conglomerate, both of which operate in the materials and composites sector, suggesting that
the group may be attempting to steal intellectual property.

Longstanding APT group
Blackfly is one of the longest known Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, active
since at least 2010. Early attacks were distinguished by the use of the PlugX/Fast
(Backdoor.Korplug), Winnti/Pasteboy (Backdoor.Winnti), and Shadowpad
(Backdoor.Shadowpad) malware families. The group initially made a name for itself through
attacks on the computer gaming industry. It subsequently branched out into targeting a more
diverse range of targets, including organizations in the semiconductor, telecoms, materials
manufacturing, pharmaceutical, media and advertising, hospitality, natural resources,
fintech, and food sectors.
Blackfly has been closely associated with a second Chinese APT group known as Grayfly, so
much so that some vendors track the two groups as one actor: APT41. A 2020 indictment of
seven men on charges relating to hundreds of cyber attacks carried out by both groups
appeared to shed light on this link. Two Chinese nationals were alleged to have worked with
both groups. A crossover in personnel may account for the similarities between both groups.

Undeterred
2/4

Despite being the subject of a U.S. indictment, Blackfly has continued to mount attacks,
seemingly undeterred by the publicity afforded to the group. Although it originally made a
name for itself by attacking the gaming sector, the group appears focused on targeting
intellectual property in a variety of sectors at present.
