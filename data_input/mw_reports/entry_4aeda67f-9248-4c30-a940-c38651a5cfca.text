July 27, 2018

In July 2018, Unit 42 analyzed a targeted attack using a novel ﬁle type against at least one
government agency in the Middle East. It was carried out by a previously unpublished threat
group we track as DarkHydrus. Based on our telemetry, we were able to uncover additional
artifacts leading us to believe this adversary group has been in operation with their current
playbook since early 2016. This attack diverged from previous attacks we observed from this
group as it involved spear-phishing emails sent to targeted organizations with password
protected RAR archive attachments that contained malicious Excel Web Query ﬁles (.iqy).
.iqy ﬁles are simple text ﬁles containing a URL which are opened by default by Excel. Once
opened, Excel will retrieve whatever object is at the URL inside the ﬁle. These ﬁles have
most recently been found in use by criminals to deliver commodity RATs such as Flawed
Ammyy. In DarkHydrus’s case, the preferred payload retrieved in their previous attacks were
exclusively open-source legitimate tools which they abuse for malicious purposes, such as
Meterpreter and Cobalt Strike. However, in this instance, it appears that this group used a
custom PowerShell based payload that we call RogueRobin.
Attack Analysis
The actors sent the spear-phishing emails between July 15 and 16. Each of the emails had a
password protected RAR archive attached named credential.rar. The body of the message,
seen in Figure 1 was written in Arabic and asks the recipient to review the document within
the archive. The message also includes the password 123456 that is required to open the
RAR archive. The credential.rar archive contained a malicious .iqy ﬁle named credential.iqy.

Figure 1 Message body in delivery email
Google Translate renders the Arabic message as:
Hi
Please review and review the attached ﬁle
Gratefully
Password: 123456

Payload Analysis
The credential.iqy is an .iqy ﬁle (SHA256:
cc1966eff7bed11c1faada0bb0ed0c8715404abd936cfa816cef61863a0c1dd6) that contains
nothing more than the following text string:
hxxp://micrrosoft[.]net/releasenotes.txt
Microsoft Excel natively opens .iqy ﬁles and will use the URL in the ﬁle to obtain remote data
to include in the spreadsheets. By default, Excel does not allow the download of data from
the remote server, but will ask for the user’s consent by presenting the dialog box in Figure 2:

Figure 2 Excel security notice for .iqy ﬁles
By enabling this data connection, the user allows Excel to obtain content from the URL in the
.iqy ﬁle. The contents within the releasenotes.txt ﬁle (SHA256:
bf925f340920111b385078f3785f486fff1096fd0847b993892ff1ee3580fa9d) contains the
following formula that Excel will save to the “A0” cell in the worksheet:

The formula uses a command prompt to run a PowerShell script that attempts to download
and execute a second PowerShell script hosted at the URL
hxxp://micrrosoft[.]net/winupdate.ps1. By default, Excel will not launch the command prompt
application, but will do so with the user’s consent via the following dialog box in Figure 3:

The winupdate.ps1 script (SHA256:
36862f654c3356d2177b5d35a410c78ff9803d1d7d20da0b82e3d69d640e856e) is the main
payload of this attack that we call RogueRobin. Its developer used the open source InvokeObfuscation tool to obfuscate this PowerShell script, speciﬁcally using the COMPRESS

technique offered by Invoke-Obfuscation. The decompressed PowerShell payload has some
similarities to the PowerShell Empire agent, such as the use of a jitter value and commands
referred to by job ID, but we do not have conclusive evidence that the author of this tool used
Empire as a basis for their tool.
Before carrying out any of its functionality the payload checks to see if it is executing in a
sandbox. The payload uses WMI queries and checks running processes for evidence that the
script may be executing within an analysis environment. The speciﬁc sandbox checks
include:
Using WMI to check BIOS version (SMBIOSBIOSVERSION) for VBOX, bochs, qemu,
virtualbox and vm.
Using WMI to check the BIOS manufacturer for XEN.
Using WMI to check if the total physical memory is less than 2900000000.
Using WMI to check if the number of CPU cores is less than or equal to 1.
Enumerates running processes for “Wireshark” and “Sysinternals”.
If the payload determines it is not running in a sandbox, it will attempt to install itself to the
system to persistently execute. To install the payload, the script will create a ﬁle
%APPDATA%\OneDrive.bat and save the following string to it:
powershell.exe -WindowStyle Hidden -exec bypass -File “%APPDATA%\OneDrive.ps1”
The script then writes a modiﬁed copy of itself to %APPDATA%\OneDrive.ps1, with the code
that performs this installation omitted. To persistently execute when the system starts, the
script will create the following shortcut in the Windows startup folder, which will run the
OneDrive.ps1 script each time the user logs in:
$env:SystemDrive\Users\$env:USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start
Menu\Programs\Startup\OneDrive.lnk
The payload itself communicates with its conﬁgured command and control (C2) servers using
a custom DNS tunneling protocol. The domains conﬁgured within this payload are:
Anyconnect[.]stream
Bigip[.]stream
Fortiweb[.]download
Kaspersky[.]science
microtik[.]stream
owa365[.]bid
symanteclive[.]download
windowsdefender[.]win
The DNS tunneling protocol can use multiple different DNS query types to interact with the
C2 server. The payload has a function it calls early on that tests to see which DNS query
types are able to successfully reach the C2 server. It iterates through a list of types and the
ﬁrst DNS type to receive a response from the C2 server will be used for all communications
between the payload and the C2 server, which are in the following order (editor’s note: AC is
not a DNS record type but is a mode where the trojan will perform a request for an A record
requiring ac as a subdomain):
A
AAAA
AC – (see note above)

CNAME

SOA
The payload uses the built-in Windows nslookup application with speciﬁc parameters and
specially crafted subdomains to communicate with the C2. To establish communications with
the C2, the payload will ﬁrst get a system speciﬁc identiﬁer issued by the C2 server. The
initial DNS query sent by the payload to obtain the system speciﬁc identiﬁer uses the
following structure, which includes the current process identiﬁer (PID) as the subdomain of
the C2 domain:
<current process id>.<c2 domain>
The C2 server will provide the system speciﬁc identiﬁer within the answer portion of the DNS
response. Table 1 explains how the payload obtains the system identiﬁer from the C2
server’s answer depending on the query type:
DNS Type

Description

A

Uses the regular expression ‘(\d+)\-.$Global:domain’ to get the deci‐
mal value from the answer

AAAA

The payload will split the IPv6 answer on “:” take the [0] and [1] digits
treat them as a hexadecimal value to obtain an integer.

AC,CNAME,MX,TXT,SRV,SOA

Uses the regular expression ‘Address:\s+(\d+.\d+.\d+.\d+)’ and uses
the decimal value in the ﬁrst octet of that IPv4 address

Table 1 Breakdown of query types
Once the system identiﬁer is obtained, the payload gathers system speciﬁc information and
sends it to the C2 server. The information gathered is added to a string in the following
structure:
<IP address>|<computer name>|<domain>|<username>|<isAdmin ﬂag>|<hasGarbage ﬂag
from conﬁg>|<hasStartup ﬂag from conﬁg>|<“hybrid” mode ﬂag from conﬁg>|<sleep interval
from conﬁg>|<jitter value from conﬁg>
The payload will base64 encode this string and use its DNS tunneling protocol to transmit the
data to the C2. The tunneling protocol transmits data by sending a series of DNS queries
with the data within the subdomain of the C2 domain. The structure of each of these
outbound DNS requests is as follows:
<system ID>-<job ID>-<offset in data><more data ﬂag>-<random length of base64 encoded
data between 30 and 42 characters>.<c2 domain>
The payload will look for different responses to these outbound queries depending on the
type of DNS request that the payload uses to communicate with the C2. The following shows
the speciﬁc IP addresses or strings used by the C2 to transmit a success or cancel message
depending on the type of DNS query used for C2 communications:
DNS Type

Successful

Cancel

After providing system speciﬁc information, the payload will Interact with the C2 server to
obtain commands, which the payload refers to as jobs. The C2 will provide a string that the
payload will use to determine the command to execute based on its command handler. To
obtain strings to treat as commands, the payload will issue a series of DNS queries to
resolve domains with the following structure:
<system id>-<job ID>-<offset data speciﬁc to job>.<c2 domain>
The C2 server will provide responses to these queries that contain answers in IPv4 or IPv6
addresses depending on the type of DNS query the payload uses to communicate with its C2
server. The payload will use a speciﬁc regular expressions dependent on the type of DNS
query was used to obtain the command string, which can be seen in Table 2:
DNS TYPE

Regex Pattern

A

Address:\s+(\d+.\d+.\d+.\d+)

AC

\d+-\d+-(\d+)-([\w\d+/=]+)-\d-.ac.$Global:domain

AAAA

Address:\s+(([a-fA-F0-9]{0,4}:{1,4}[\w|:]+){1,8})

CNAME,MX,TXT,SRV,SOA

(\d+)-([\w\d/=+]{0,})\-.$Global:domain

Table 2 Types of responses provided by C2
These regular expressions are used to build strings that the payload will then subject to its
command handler. We analyzed the payload to determine the commands available, which
provide a variety of remote administration capabilities. The command handle looks for the
following command strings in Table 3:
Com‐

Table 3 Commands available to payload
Campaign Analysis
The following domains are conﬁgured within the payload to be used as C2s. Thematically,
each domain appeared to be attempting to spoof the legitimate domain of an existing
technology provider with an emphasis on security vendors.
Anyconnect[.]stream
Bigip[.]stream
Fortiweb[.]download
Kaspersky[.]science
microtik[.]stream
owa365[.]bid
symanteclive[.]download
windowsdefender[.]win
The listed C2 servers all resolved to IPs belonging to a service provider in China at
1.2.9.0/24, which is the IP address used by the C2 server to send a cancel communications
message to the end system. These IPs provided insufﬁcient data for additional investigations.
However, each of the listed domains used ns102.kaspersky[.]host and
ns103.kaspersky[.]host as their name servers. Examination of ns102/ns103.kaspersky[.]host
revealed that the second level domain kaspersky[.]host was illegitimate and not owned by the
legitimate Kaspersky Labs. Passive DNS resolution of kaspersky[.]host revealed two IPs of
interest, 107.175.150[.]113 and 94.130.88[.]9.
94.130.88[.]9 showed passive DNS resolutions of two additional domains, 0utlook[.]bid and
hotmai1[.]com. It is unknown what these domains may have been used for but based on the
similarity of domain spooﬁng and sharing an IP, they are likely part of the adversary
infrastructure. 107.175.150[.]113 showed one other domain resolution,
<redacted>.0utl00k[.]net. We were able to link this speciﬁc domain as a C2 for another
weaponized document (SHA256:
d393349a4ad00902e3d415b622cf27987a0170a786ca3a1f991a521bff645318) containing a
PowerShell script very similar to the one found in this attack. Examining the second level
domain of 0utl00k[.]net revealed another IP of interest, 195.154.41[.]150. This IP contained
two other domain resolutions following the vendor spooﬁng theme: allexa[.]net and
cisc0[.]net. Expanding upon cisc0[.]net, we discovered several weaponized documents and
payloads using this domain as a C2, from mid to late 2017.
Open source intelligence provided by ClearSky Security indicates the domain cisc0[.]net is
possibly related to the adversary group known as Copy Kittens. While there are signiﬁcant

tactical overlaps such as similarity of techniques used as well as victimology, we were unable
to uncover signiﬁcant evidence of relational overlaps. Further information regarding the Copy
Kittens adversary can be found in a paper titled Operation Wilted Tulip.
Our own dataset provides a solid grouping of the DarkHydrus group, with signiﬁcant overlaps
in C2 infrastructure as well as similarities in weaponized binaries. C2 domains were also left
online and reused over an extended amount of time, such as the domain micrrosoft[.]net
which was used in this attack in addition to two other payloads in January 2017 and July
2017.
Studying the other samples, we have attributed to DarkHydrus, we are able to ascertain that
this adversary has mainly leveraged weaponized Microsoft Ofﬁce documents using tools
available freely or from open source repositories such as Meterpreter, Mimikatz,
PowerShellEmpire, Veil, and CobaltStrike. The documents generally do not contain malicious
code and instead are weaponized to retrieve remote ﬁles containing malicious code on
execution. Due to the modular nature of the delivery document, available data for analysis for
these attacks are dependent upon the operational nature of the C2 server at the time of
execution.
Conclusion
The DarkHydrus group carried out an attack campaign on at least one government agency in
the Middle East using malicious .iqy ﬁles. The .iqy ﬁles take advantage of Excel’s willingness
to download and include the contents from a remote server in a spreadsheet. DarkHydrus
leveraged this obscure ﬁle format to run a command to ultimately install a PowerShell scripts
to gain backdoor access to the system. The PowerShell backdoor delivered in this current
attack may have been custom developed by the threat group, however, it is possible that
DarkHydrus pieced together this tool by using code from legitimate open source tools.
