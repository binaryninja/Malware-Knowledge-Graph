Operation Copied and Removed Malware Known as “Cyclops Blink” from the Botnet’s
Command-And-Control Devices, Disrupting the GRU’s Control Over Thousands of
Infected Devices Worldwide. Victims Must Take Additional Steps to Remediate the
Vulnerability and Prevent Malicious Actors From Further Exploiting Unpatched
Devices.
The Justice Department today announced a court-authorized operation, conducted in March
2022, to disrupt a two-tiered global botnet of thousands of infected network hardware
devices under the control of a threat actor known to security researchers as Sandworm,
which the U.S. government has previously attributed to the Main Intelligence Directorate of
the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (the GRU). The operation
copied and removed malware from vulnerable internet-connected firewall devices that
Sandworm used for command and control (C2) of the underlying botnet. Although the
operation did not involve access to the Sandworm malware on the thousands of underlying
victim devices worldwide, referred to as “bots,” the disabling of the C2 mechanism severed
those bots from the Sandworm C2 devices’ control.

“This court-authorized removal of malware deployed by the Russian GRU demonstrates the
department’s commitment to disrupt nation-state hacking using all of the legal tools at our
disposal,” said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department’s
National Security Division. “By working closely with WatchGuard and other government
agencies in this country and the United Kingdom to analyze the malware and to develop
detection and remediation tools, we are together showing the strength that public-private
partnership brings to our country’s cybersecurity. The department remains committed to
confronting and disrupting nation-state hacking, in whatever form it takes.”
“Through close collaboration with WatchGuard and our law enforcement partners, we
identified, disrupted and exposed yet another example of the Russian GRU’s hacking of
innocent victims in the United States and around the world,” said U.S. Attorney Cindy K.
Chung for the Western District of Pennsylvania. “Such activities are not only criminal but also
threaten the national security of the United States and its allies. My office remains committed
to working with our partners in the National Security Division, the FBI, foreign law
enforcement agencies and the private sector to defend and maintain our nation’s
cybersecurity.”
“This operation is an example of the FBI’s commitment to combatting cyber threats through
our unique authorities, capabilities, and coordination with our partners,” said Assistant
Director Bryan Vorndran of the FBI’s Cyber Division. “As the lead domestic law enforcement
and intelligence agency, we will continue pursuing cyber actors that threaten the national
security and public safety of the American people, our private sector partners and our
international partners.”
“The FBI prides itself on working closely with our law enforcement and private sector
partners to expose criminals who hide behind their computer and launch attacks that
threaten Americans’ safety, security and confidence in our digitally connected world,” said
Special Agent in Charge Mike Nordwall of the FBI’s Pittsburgh Field Office. “The FBI has an
unwavering commitment to combat and disrupt Russia’s efforts to gain a foothold inside U.S.
and allied networks.”
On Feb. 23, the United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre, the Department of
Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the FBI and the
National Security Agency released an advisory identifying the Cyclops Blink malware, which
targets network devices manufactured by WatchGuard Technologies Inc. (WatchGuard) and
ASUSTek Computer Inc. (ASUS). These network devices are often located on the perimeter
of a victim’s computer network, thereby providing Sandworm with the potential ability to
conduct malicious activities against all computers within those networks. As explained in the
advisory, the malware appeared to have emerged as early as June 2019, and was the
apparent successor to another Sandworm botnet called VPNFilter, which the Department of
Justice disrupted through a court-authorized operation in 2018.

The same day as the advisory, WatchGuard released detection and remediation tools for
users of WatchGuard devices. The advisory and WatchGuard’s guidance both recommended
that device owners deploy WatchGuard’s tools to remove any malware infection and patch
their devices to the latest versions of available firmware. Later, ASUS released its own
guidance to help compromised ASUS device owners mitigate the threat posed by Cyclops
Blink malware. The public and private sector efforts were effective, resulting in the successful
remediation of thousands of compromised devices. However, by mid-March, a majority of the
originally compromised devices remained infected.
Following the initial court authorization on March 18, the department’s operation was
successful in copying and removing the malware from all remaining identified C2 devices. It
also closed the external management ports that Sandworm was using to access those C2
devices, as recommended in WatchGuard’s remediation guidance (a non-persistent change
that the owner of an affected device can reverse through a device restart). These steps had
the immediate effect of preventing Sandworm from accessing these C2 devices, thereby
disrupting Sandworm’s control of the infected bot devices controlled by the remediated C2
devices. However, WatchGuard and ASUS devices that acted as bots may remain vulnerable
to Sandworm if device owners do not take the WatchGuard and ASUS recommended
detection and remediation steps. The department strongly encourages network defenders
and device owners to review the Feb. 23 advisory and WatchGuard and ASUS releases.
The operation announced today leveraged direct communications with the Sandworm
malware on the identified C2 devices and, other than collecting the underlying C2 devices’
serial numbers through an automated script and copying the C2 malware, it did not search
for or collect other information from the relevant victim networks. Further, the operation did
not involve any FBI communications with bot devices.
Since prior to the Feb. 23 advisory, the FBI has been attempting to provide notice to owners
of infected WatchGuard devices in the United States and, through foreign law enforcement
partners, abroad. For those domestic victims whose contact information was not publicly
available, the FBI has contacted providers (such as a victim’s internet service provider) and
has asked those providers to provide notice to the victims. As required by the terms of the
court authorization, the FBI has provided notice to the owners of the domestic C2 devices
from which the FBI copied and removed the Cyclops Blink malware.
The efforts to disrupt the Cyclops Blink botnet were led by the FBI’s Pittsburgh, Atlanta and
Oklahoma City Field Offices, the FBI Cyber Division, the National Security Division’s
Counterintelligence and Export Control Section, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the
Western District of Pennsylvania. Assistance was also provided by the Criminal Division’s
Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Office of International Affairs, as well
as the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of California.

If you believe you have a compromised device, please contact your local FBI Field Office for
assistance. The FBI continues to conduct a thorough and methodical investigation into this
cyber incident.
