Info-stealer Campaign targets German Car Dealerships
and Manufacturers
blog.checkpoint.com/2022/05/10/a-german-car-attack-on-german-vehicle-businesses/
May 10, 2022

Introduction:
It started with a seemingly benign email, dealing with the purchase of a vehicle, and ended
in a reveal of a months’ long campaign targeting German organizations. Most of the targets
are related to the German auto-industry sector and the attacks were designed to deploy
various types of info-stealing malware. The threat actors behind the operation registered
multiple lookalike domains, all imitating existing German auto businesses that they later
used to send phishing emails and to host the malware infrastructure.
In the following publication, we review the details of this operation, from the initial
infrastructure preparations, through the different infection-chain stages, to the details of the
final payloads.

Key findings:
Dedicated campaign targeting German companies with a focus on German car
dealerships and manufacturers.
Extensive infrastructure designed to look like existing German car dealerships and
manufacturers.
Emails with receipts and contracts in German, designed to instill confidence and lure
recipients were sent to carefully selected targets.
The main malware hosting site is an Iranian hosted non-governmental website with a
double connection to the campaign.

Detailed description:
1/12

Germans love their cars, goes the cliché, which might have been the inspiration for a
malicious email received by a German business.
The email was designed to look as if it had been sent from a car dealership, autohous[.]lips,
with the subject line “re: order.” Written in German, the email includes an ISO file
attachment labeled as “vehicle invoice.” When the recipient double clicked the ISO
attachment, a short warning message appeared, after which the user was required to open
an .HTA (HTML Applications) file.

The use of ISO disk image archives is a known technique used to bypass NTFS Mark-ofthe-Web trust control (MOTW). (See MITRE ref. here)
Files extracted from ISO archives are not tagged as MOTW, and therefore, even if they are
downloaded from the internet, no warning is displayed to the user.

Archived in the ISO file is an .HTA file, which is opened by the Mshta.exe utility in Windows
OS. It is often used by threat-actors to execute HTML files with embedded JavaScript or
VBScript. Even advanced threat groups such as APT29 were recently reported to use this
combination of ISO and HTA files against European diplomats.

The HTA file includes HTML code to display a purchase contract in German

Figure 5 – Car purchase contract displayed to victim
While Mshta.exe displays a decoy car purchase contract, in the background it executes a
VBScript code. We found several versions of these scripts, some triggering PowerShell
code, some obfuscated and others in plain text. All of them download and execute various
MaaS (Malware as a Service) info-stealers.

With later versions of the HTA file, PowerShell code is used to change registry values to
enable Office macros and run Outlook attachments and files downloaded from the internet
in non-protected mode.

Infrastructure
The first email we examined was sent from autohous-lips[.]de. It is a lookalike domain which
was registered and resolved shortly before it was used to send the email. Another email
which carried a similar .ISO archive was sent from fiat-amenn[.]de.
Both email address impersonate existing car-related businesses in Germany.
Mapping the domains to their hosting server IP addresses, we encountered more than 30
other domains, all registered in recent months, all of whom imitate existing German autoindustry related businesses with a single character variation.

Using these domains as our starting point, we tracked more emails on VirusTotal that were
part of this campaign. These additional emails were sent from 6 of the previously
discovered

domains. In one case, auto-falkanhahn[.]de, the threat actors used this domain as a
malware-hosting site for their final payload. Although the first malicious email we tracked
dated back to the end of July 2021, most of the emails we found were sent in three waves:,
at the end of October 2021, the end of November 2021 and mid-March 2022.
The attackers began registering domains before the attacks and we noticed this trend
continued as we tracked the operation.

Dropped payloads
We encountered three methods of hosting the payloads. In the first wave of emails, the
malware-hosting sites used DuckDNS URLs. In one case we found a direct URL to one of
the lookalike domains. The majority of cases used a single website hosted in Iran –
bornagroup[.]ir.
We encountered several executables hosted on this site, which frequently changed its
location and type. (See Appendix). The payloads were MaaS (Malware as a Service) infostealers: AZORult, BitRAT and Raccoon. All are available for purchase in various markets
and groups.

Victimology and attribution
We traced 14 targeted entities. All of the targets are German or related to German
businesses, and most of them connected to the auto-industry, ranging from car dealerships
to manufacturers. and the targets we located complies with these characteristics.
The identity of who is behind this operation is not clear. We found certain connections to
Iranian non-state entities but it is unclear whether they were legitimate sites that were
compromised or have a more substantial connection to this operation.
Bornagroup[.]ir is the main site used in this campaign to host various info-stealers. It was
registered using the email address [email protected][.]com by an “Amir Heidari Forooshani.”
This persona is connected to the campaign from two distinct sources. On one side,

7/12

Figure 12 – Hosting site double relation to German operation
bornagroup[.]ir is used to host various info-stealers, and it is used in multiple emails sent
from a net of dedicated lookalike domains.
From another side, the sub-domain santandbnkplc[.]turbocell[.]ir, registered by the same
registrant (Heidari), was used in a phishing operation targeting customers of a subsidiary of
a Spanish bank in South America (Santander Bank). Another part of this “Santander”
campaign is hosted on the same Iranian ISP. Its domain is registered under a name
impersonating another German vehicle entity “Kfz – Sauter GmbH & Co. KG”. This same
entity “Kfz – Sauter GmbH & Co. KG” was used to register a lookalike domain,
groupschumecher[.]com, which is part of the main German-Auto campaign. This double
connection may imply a more substantial Iranian link to the campaign.

Top 5 Anti-Phishing Principles
Inform Employees About Corporate Email Policies :
Every organization should have an email security policy, including anti-phishing
principles defining acceptable use of email (and other communications solutions). This
policy should describe acceptable and unacceptable use and how to respond to
potential attacks (i.e. reporting suspicious emails to IT and deleting any known
phishing content)

Review Password Security Best Practices:
User credentials are one of the primary targets of cybercriminals. If an attacker has an
employee’s password, it can be much more difficult to detect ongoing attacks since
they can masquerade as a legitimate user. Additionally, employees commonly use the
same password for multiple online accounts, meaning that a single breached
password can grant an attacker access to a number of the employee’s online
accounts. For this reason, credential theft is a common target of phishing emails. It is
important to educate employees about the threat posed by phishing emails and about
password security best practices.
Deploy an Automated Anti-Phishing Solution:
Despite an organization’s best efforts, employee cybersecurity education will not
provide perfect protection against phishing attacks. These attacks are growing
increasingly sophisticated and can even trick cybersecurity experts in some cases.
While phishing education can help to reduce the number of successful phishing
attacks against the organization, some emails are likely to sneak through. Minimizing
the risk of phishing attacks to the organization requires AI-based anti-phishing
software capable of identifying and blocking phishing content across all of the
organization’s communication services (email, productivity applications, etc.) and
platforms (employee workstations, mobile devices, etc.). This comprehensive
coverage is necessary since phishing content can come over any medium, and
employees may be more vulnerable to attacks when using mobile devices.
Educate Employees About Current Phishing Threats:
Phishing attacks use human nature to trick people into doing something that the
attacker wants. Common techniques include creating a sense of urgency and offering
the recipient of the email something that they desire, which increases the probability
that the target will take action without properly validating the email. By offering
information, goods, or opportunities related to a current event or creating a situation
where the recipient believes that something has gone wrong (like a fake package
delivery notification), these emails increase their probability of getting clicks. Phishing
techniques and the pretexts used by cybercriminals to make their attacks seem
realistic change regularly. Employees should be trained on current phishing trends to
increase the probability that they can identify and properly respond to phishing
attacks. The organization’s email policy should be regularly reviewed as part of the
organization’s cybersecurity awareness training.

Conclusion
We discovered a targeted attack being aimed at German businesses, mainly car dealers.
The threat actors are using a vast infrastructure designed to mimic existing German
companies. The attackers used phishing emails, with a combination of ISO\HTA payloads
that, if opened, would infect victims with various info stealing malware.
We do not have conclusive evidence of the attackers’ motivation, but we believe it was
more than simply harvesting credit card details or personal information. We have evidence
9/12

that this is an ongoing campaign that has been conducted since at least July 2021 (or
possibly even earlier, since March). It may be related to industrial espionage or business
fraud, but more information is required to establish the attackers’ exact motivation.
The targets are carefully selected and the way the phishing emails were sent would allow
correspondence between the victims and attackers. One possibility is that the attackers
were trying to compromise car dealerships and use their infrastructure and data to gain
access to secondary targets like larger suppliers and manufacturers. That would be useful
for BEC (Business, Email Compromise) frauds or industrial espionage.
The social engineering attracted our attention, like how the threat actors selected the
businesses to impersonate, also the phrasing of the emails and the attached documents.
This type of attack is all about convincing the recipient of the authenticity of the lure.
Gaining access to several victims at the same time gives a significant advantage to the
attacker.
Check Point customers are protected against this attack.
