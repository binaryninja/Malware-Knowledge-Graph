Background
Recently, 360 Threat Intelligence Center is investigating one email phishing attack which is targeting one
Pakistani businessman who is working in China. First attack of this campaign took place in May 2018.
Attackers have taken over of target machines over months. TTP of this targeting attack will be introduced,
as well as remediation advice.
We identiﬁed this APT group coded as ‘APT-C-35’ in 2017, who is mainly targeting Pakistan and other
South Asian countries for cyber espionage[1]. Arbor also published APT research on this group, and
named it ‘Donot’[2]. The group attacked government agencies, aiming for classiﬁed intelligence. At least 4
attack campaigns against Pakistan have been observed by us since 2017. Spear phishing emails with
vulnerable Ofﬁce documents or malicious macros are sent to victims. Two unique malware frameworks,
EHDevel and yty, are developed by attackers. In the latest attack, Donot group is targeting Pakistani
businessman working in China.

Fishing Attack
The process of attacking target is as following:

Dropper - Excel Macros
Attackers lure victim to open decoy Excel ﬁle with malicious macro which is sent as attachment in a
phishing email. While macro code is running, ofﬁce_update.exe is dropped at C:\micro and run. The decoy
Excel document pretends to be pricing list of one BMW car, which is easy to have trust of the victim:

Ofﬁce_updata.exe is a downloader, which is able to download a BAT ﬁle by
http://bigdata.akamaihub.stream/pushBatch:

The BAT ﬁle is mainly to modify registry for persistence, and create a directory with hidden property, etc. It
can also download wlidsvcc.exe from http://bigdata.akamaihub.stream/pushAgent, then save it in
%USERPROFILE%\BackConﬁg\BackUp directory:

After that, Ofﬁce_updata.exe will remove itself from system.

Wlidsvcc.exe is also a downloader. It downloads 3 plugins from C2 server, naming wuaupdt.exe, kylgr.exe,
and svchots.exe. Mutex "wlidsvcc" is created to ensure that only one instance runs in system:

Then, it determines if the current process path is %USERPROFILE%BackConﬁg\BackUp\wlidsvcc.exe:

If the path meets condition, wlidsvcc.exe communicates with C2 (bigdata.akamaihub.stream) by POST,
which is to retrieve remote commands

If C2 sends ‘no’ command, wlidsvcc.exe will retry to contact C2 after sleeping for 90 seconds:

If ‘cmdline’ command is received, wlidsvcc.exe runs plug-in
%USERPROFILE%\BackConﬁg\BackUp\wuaupdt.exe, and then listens for follow-up commands:

If commands are neither ‘no’ nor ‘cmdline’, wlidsvcc.exe downloads

wuaupdt.exe is a CMD backdoor, which can receive and execute CMD commands sent from C2. It can also
execute other plugins if commands are issued by attackers. The analysis of all backdoor plugins is shown
in the following section.

This plugin is a keylogger. It ﬁrstly creates a ﬁle inc3++.txt in current directory and check whether a
keylogging ﬁle exists in %USERPROFILE%\Printers\Neighbourhood directory. If yes, it saves log ﬁle name
and its last modiﬁcation time to inc3++.txt:

If keylogging ﬁle is found in %USERPROFILE%\Printers\Neighbourhood, the log ﬁle is moved to directory
%USERPROFILE%\Printers\Neighbourhood\Spools:

A new keylogging ﬁle is created in %USERPROFILE%\Printers\Neighbourhood, with ﬁlename
‘username_year_month_day(hour_minute_second)’. Then, it monitors activities of mouse and keyboard
constantly.

The main function of malicious macro code is to drop skypet.exe in the directory %APPDATA%, and to drop
skype.bat in the directory C:\Skype. skypet.bat is executed after that:

Skyep.bat
Skyep.bat creates 3 directories %USERPROFILE%Printers\Spools,
%USERPROFILE%BackConﬁg\BackUp and %USERPROFILE%BackConﬁg\BigData , and then sets these
folder properties to hidden:

The BAT ﬁle also gets the computer name, and save it into
%USERPROFILE%\BackConﬁg\Backup\pcap.txt:

And it creates multiple registry entries for persistence. Then, it starts skyep.exe and deletes itself:

This ﬁle, similar to wlidsvcc.exe, is to execute commands from C2 server. Firstly, it reads computer name
from \\BackConﬁg\\BackUp\\pcap.txt

The computer name is then processed to a string: "orderme/computer name - random number". It contacts
C2 databig.akamaihub.stream for commands:

If command is"batcmd", \\BackConﬁg\\BigData\\test.bat is started:

By analyzing the macro code, plugins, domain name /IP correlation in the attack, we conﬁrm that Donot
APT Group (APT-C-35) is behind the attack.

Similarity of Macro Code
ASERT disclosed one macro sample linking to DONOT APT Group in March 2018[2]. That macro sample is
very similar to the sample in this attack: a decoy picture is pop up after macro runs.

Similarity of Plug-ins
Similar to previous Donot samples, new sample downloads plugins from C2. It is also packed by UPX and
is written in Go language. Furthermore, it has similar code logic as previous ones

wuaupdt.exe in this attack appears in previous Donot attack[1], and C2 addresses are same to previous
ones.

From the attack activity captured this time, it is obvious that Donot APT group is still keen on Pakistan as
primary target of attack, and even expands scope of attack to include Pakistani staffs and institutions in
China. There is a sign that the Donot group has never stopped its attacks and another cyber espionage
attack could be launched soon.
360 Threat Intelligence Center suggests enterprises to improve employees' security awareness by provide
them sufﬁcient security training, especially anti-phishing training. Situational awareness, asset
management, and threat intelligence can prevent such attacks signiﬁcantly.
For 360 ESG customers, detection to Donot group and related IOCs are supported by products integrated
with threat intelligence, including 360 Threat Intelligence Platform, SkyEye Advance Threat Detection
System, 360 NGSOC.
