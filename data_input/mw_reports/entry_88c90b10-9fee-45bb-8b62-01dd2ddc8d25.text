2. Open cmd (the tool does not require elevated (Administrator) privileges)
3. Move to the path where this tool was downloaded
4. In the cmd prompt, type ZLAB_LooCipher_Decryptor.exe <PID>

Disclaimer
Due to the continuing LooCipher infection campaign, we proceeded to release the decryptor
in the shortest possible time in order to help the victims infected in the previous phase. So,
the tool is a Beta release and it is still composed by an unsigned executable. We will provide
to release some updates as soon as possible.
Thanks to Fortinet for their analysis about LooCipher obfuscation flaw. The tool embeds
parts of Fortinet script.
