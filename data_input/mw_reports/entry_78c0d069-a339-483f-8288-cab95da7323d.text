A newly patched zero­day vulnerability in Internet Explorer
(http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/remote­code­execution­vulnerability­internet­
explorer­patched) has already been exploited in attacks involving a compromised website
belonging to an evangelical church in Hong Kong. Symantec telemetry revealed an exploit
hosted on the compromised site, which was used to infect visitors with the Korplug back door
(detected by Symantec as Backdoor.Korplug
(http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012­062914­2531­99)).
The attackers compromised the website of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hong Kong
and modified it to host a malicious iFrame which redirected visitors to another website hosting
an exploit of the Microsoft Internet Explorer Remote Memory Corruption Vulnerability
(http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/76403) (CVE­2015­2502). The IP address of this website is
115.144.107.55.
This website hosts a file called vvv.html, which redirects to one of two other files called a.js
and b.js and leads to the download of a file called java.html to the victim’s computer. Java.html
installs Korplug on the computer, in the form of an executable called c.exe.

Figure 1. Malicious iFrame hosted on compromised Hong Kong website
Korplug (also known as PlugX) is a Trojan that maintains a back door on an infected computer
and facilitates information stealing. Symantec has previously released several blogs
(http://www.symantec.com/connect/nl/blog­tags/backdoorkorplug) around Korplug. The
malware has been used in a range of attacks, mainly in Asia, over the past three years.

Figure 2. Zero­day exploit leads to Korplug infection
The new Internet Explorer zero­day bug was patched yesterday by Microsoft as part
of Security Bulletin MS15­093 (https://technet.microsoft.com/en­us/library/security/ms15­
093.aspx). The vulnerability permits remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted
web page using Internet Explorer. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability will grant the
attacker the same user rights as the current user. Microsoft’s security update resolves this
issue by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
