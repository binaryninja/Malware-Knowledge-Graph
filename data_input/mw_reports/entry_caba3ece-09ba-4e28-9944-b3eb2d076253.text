SUMMARY
The Gamaredon Group has been actively targeting the Ukrainian government lately, relying
on the infrastructure of the popular messaging service Telegram to bypass traditional
network traffic detection techniques without raising obvious flags. Back in November 2022,
BlackBerry uncovered a new Gamaredon campaign that relied on a multi-stage Telegram
scheme to first profile potential victims, and then deliver the final payload along with the
malicious command-and-control (C2).
This report provides information about the recent network infrastructure from Crimea that
the Gamaredon Group uses, as well as analysis of each step before the victims receive the
final payload.

Technical Analysis
Context
The Gamaredon Group is a Russian state-sponsored cyber espionage group that has been
active since 2013. Over the years, Gamaredon’s main target has always been Ukrainian
government organizations. To bypass the government’s security measures, the threat group
works continually to improve their malicious code over time.
In mid-September 2022, Talos Intelligence reported Gamaredon’s latest attack on Ukrainian
government organizations and exposed details of the complete execution chain. In
November 2022, the BlackBerry Research and Intelligence Team uncovered Gamaredon’s
latest campaign, which relied on Telegram for malicious network structure purposes.

2/17

The initial infection vector we reported on was weaponized documents written in both the
Russian and Ukrainian languages and sent via spear-phishing techniques, exploiting the
remote template injection vulnerability that enables attackers to bypass Microsoft Word
macro protections to compromise target systems with malware, gain access to information,
then spread the infection to other users.
The Gamaredon Group’s network infrastructure relies on multi-stage Telegram accounts for
victim profiling and confirmation of geographic location, and then finally leads the victim to
the next stage server for the final payload. This kind of technique to infect target systems is
new.

In a similar fashion to their previous campaigns, Gamaredon relies on the highly targeted
distribution of weaponized documents. Their malicious lures mimic documents originating
from real Ukrainian government organizations, and are carefully designed to trick those who
may have a real reason to interact with those organizations.

Figure 4 – Malicious lure document written in the Ukrainian language in the name of the
Ministry of Justice of Ukraine
As an example, the document with the filename “Бас по Род. славе.docx” employs a
remote template injection technique (CVE-2017-0199) in order to gain initial access. Once
the malicious document is opened, it fetches the specified address and downloads the next
stage of the attack chain.

Weaponization
The server's configuration deploys the next stage payload only to targets with a Ukrainian
IP address. If it matches the IP's validation and confirms the target is indeed located in
Ukraine, it then drops a heavily obfuscated VBA script.

Figure 6 – Obfuscated routines from the second stage of the attack chain
The script creates the following location and drops a VBS file:
C:\Users\<user_name>\Downloads\expecting\deposit
Then it invokes the “wscript.exe” and runs the “deposit” file. Different implants may rely on
other locations, as in the following examples:
C:\Users\<user_name>\Downloads\bars\decrepit
8/17

C:\Users\<user_name>\Downloads\baron\demonstration
C:\Users\<user_name>\deliberate.bmp
The “decrepit” VBS is instructed to connect to a hardcoded Telegram account and to get
instructions in a slightly obfuscated format leading to a new malicious IP address.

Figure 7 – Deobfuscated code shows Gamaerdon’s Telegram account and components of
the URL for the next stage
Each Telegram account periodically deploys new IP addresses. In an interesting twist, our
findings confirm that this only happens during regular working hours in Eastern Europe.
This indicates that this is very likely a human-operated activity rather than an automated
one.

Figure 8 – Gamaredon’s Telegram account serves a next-stage IP address

9/17

Different Telegram accounts serve different IP addresses. For example, the account
"zacreq" served the following IP addresses, and likely many more.
164.92.126[.]130
45.63.42[.]255
159.65.174[.]140
Once the IP address is obtained, it is then used to construct the URL for the next stage
download.

Loader
Continuing with its execution, the script is instructed to issue a HTTP GET request to the
URL "hxxp://" & IP_from_zacreq_TG & "/deposit" & random_number & "/expecting.vac=?
derisive".

Figure 9 – Next stage delivery
Upon successful connection, the remote server returns base64 encode data blob, which
decodes to a PowerShell script. The PowerShell script is instructed to download a “get.php”
file from 213.69.3[.]218 IP address and run it.

10/17

Figure 10 – The base64 decoded data blob
To download the next stage, the “get.php” script is instructed to invoke the domain() function
which reaches out to the Telegram channel "hxxps[:]//t[.]me/s/newtesta1" to obtain a slightly
obfuscated IP address, the same way we’ve seen previously.

Figure 11 – Function to receive the IP for the next stage of the execution chain
The IP addresses listed in the “newtesta1” Telegram account are also changed periodically
by the threat group.

11/17

Figure 12 – IP address for the final stage delivery
The BlackBerry Research and Intelligence Team has monitored this account over time and
has identified the following IP address used for the delivery of the final payload:
45.77.229[.]159
64.227.1[.]3
64.227.7[.]134
84.32.128[.]41
84.32.128[.]215
104.131.39[.]154
143.110.221[.]189
157.230.223[.]20
157.230.123[.]48
158.247.199[.]37
158.247.199[.]225
165.22.7[.]242
167.172.173[.]7
170.64.152[.]42
198.13.42[.]40
206.189.143[.]206
217.69.3[.]218

Payload
If the specific criteria mentioned above is met, the server returns the payload. Upon
receiving the payload, the "get.php" script invokes the decode() function to perform an XOR
operation where the $key value is obtained from the volume serial number.

Figure 13 – Final payload decoding function
Talos has already analyzed the final payload placement. We have observed minor changes,
such as different variables and file names; however, the core logic remains the same.

Network
The Gamaredon Group has used the hxxp://t[.]me/s/* URL structure in the stage which
accesses Telegram to direct the execution to the next stage. We searched for this structure
in VirusTotal and found the following additional Telegram C2’s.

The BlackBerry Research and Intelligence Team has traced the Gamaredon Group’s activity
back to 109.200.159[.]54 using network flow data analysis. Every IP address in
communication with this node has been related to Gamaredon, in some form or fashion. For
every IP listed in this report, only three haven't been accessed by this node in the last seven
days prior to publication. That node is based in Crimea and has been active since at least
spring 2022. All communication is between ports 1000-9999 on the C2 and an ephemeral
port on the Gamaredon Group’s node.

Targets

15/17

Historically, the Gamaredon Group has solely targeted Ukraine. Based on the lure
documents we uncovered, the victims being targeted belong to strategical industries in
Ukraine, such as the military, law enforcement, and others.

Attribution
The Gamaredon Group has been publicly attributed to Russia. The geopolitical nature of
the targets, the threat actor's network infrastructure, and metadata extracted from the lure
documents appear to confirm its origins.

CONCLUSIONS
Telegram is one of the most popular messaging applications used in both Ukraine and
Russia. The Gamaredon Group relies on its infrastructure to bypass traditional network
traffic detection techniques without raising obvious flags. Their multi-staged approach,
which first confirms the victims’ location and then leads them to the final payload, means
that security researchers must work harder to track the whole attack flow and to find the
final payload.
The threat group change IP addresses dynamically, which makes it even harder to
automate analysis through sandbox techniques once the sample has aged out. The fact
that the suspect IP addresses change only during Eastern European working hours strongly
suggests that the threat actor works from one location, and with all probability belongs to an
offensive cyber unit that deploys malicious operations against Ukraine.
