Security researchers have discovered Daxin, a China-linked stealthy backdoor specifically
designed for deployment in hardened corporate networks that feature advanced threat
detection capabilities.
According to a technical report published by Symantec's Threat Hunter team today, Daxin is
one of the most advanced backdoors ever seen deployed by Chinese actors.
One point of differentiation in Daxin is its form, which is a Windows kernel driver, an atypical
choice in the malware landscape. Its stealthiness comes from its advanced communication
features, which mix its data exchange with regular internet traffic.
"Daxin is, without doubt, the most advanced piece of malware Symantec researchers have
seen used by a China-linked actor," Symantec said in a new report.
"Considering its capabilities and the nature of its deployed attacks, Daxin appears to be
optimized for use against hardened targets, allowing the attackers to burrow deep into a
target’s network and exfiltrate data without raising suspicions."

Hiding in legitimate network traffic
Backdoors provide threat actors with remote access to a compromised computer system,
allowing them to steal data, execute commands, or download and install further malware.
Because these tools are typically used to steal information from protected networks or
further compromise a device, they need to involve some form of data transfer encryption or
obfuscation to evade raising alarms on network traffic monitoring tools.

Daxin does this by monitoring network traffic on a device for specific patterns. Once these
patterns are detected, it will hijack the legitimate TCP connection and use it to communicate
with the command and control server.
By hijacking TCP communications, the Daxin malware can hide malicious communication in
what is perceived as legitimate traffic and thus remain undetected.
"Daxin’s use of hijacked TCP connections affords a high degree of stealth to its
communications and helps to establish connectivity on networks with strict firewall rules. It
may also lower the risk of discovery by SOC analysts monitoring for network anomalies,"
explains the report by Symantec.
This essentially opens an encrypted communication channel for transmitting or stealing
data, all done through a seemingly innocuous TCP tunnel.
“Daxin’s built-in functionality can be augmented by deploying additional components on the
infected computer. Daxin provides a dedicated communication mechanism for such
components by implementing a device named \\.\Tcp4,” further explained Symantec.
“The malicious components can open this device to register themselves for communication.
Each of the components can associate a 32-bit service identifier with the opened \\.\Tcp4
handle. The remote attacker is then able to communicate with selected components by
specifying a matching service identified when sending messages of a certain type.”
Daxin also stands out due to its capability to establish intricate communication pathways
across multiple infected computers at once, using a single command to a set of nodes.

This allows the threat actors to quickly re-establish connections and encrypted
communication channels in well-guarded networks.

At the same time, while the nodes are active and serve as relay points, the chances of the
malicious traffic being marked as suspicious are kept at a minimum.

Chinese cyber-espionage
Symantec's threat analysts have found evidence linking Daxin to the Chinese state-backed
hacking group Slug (aka Owlproxy).
Reportedly, the particular backdoor has been actively used in attacks since at least
November 2019, while researchers spotted signs of its deployment again in May 2020 and
July 2020.
The most recent attacks involving Daxin were observed in November 2021, targeting
telecommunication, transportation, and manufacturing companies.
It's worth noting that Symantec claims the malware was first sampled back in 2013, already
featuring the advanced detection-avoidance techniques that we see in today's version.
However, no attacks that involved Daxin were observed until later, even though it's likely
that the stealthy hackers simply remained undetected until 2019.
