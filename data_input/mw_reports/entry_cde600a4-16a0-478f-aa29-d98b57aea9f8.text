Howdy, and welcome to the ThreatConnect Research Roundup, a collection of recent
findings by our Research Team and items from open source publications that have resulted
in Observations of related indicators across ThreatConnect’s CAL™ (Collective Analytics

Roundup Highlight: Ryuk

1/5

Ryuk Tag in ThreatConnect Common Community
In this Roundup, we highlight Incident 20201023A: 20201023A: Ryuk Infrastructure
Registered on 10/20/20. ThreatConnect Research identified several probable Ryuk domains
based on consistencies with infrastructure identified in Incident 20200930A: Domains
Registered Through MonoVM Used with Cobalt Strike and other recent incidents. Those
consistencies include naming similarities, registration through NameCheap, and reuse of the
same CIDR blocks for hosting. However, those consistencies are not unique and SSL
certificates have not been created for most of the domains, nor do we have any information
on Cobalt Strike or Bazar communicating with this infrastructure. New SSL certificates or
relevant malicious file behavior consistent with the previously identified infrastructure would
help increase our confidence in the assessed relationship to Ryuk. The identified
infrastructure include the following:
The identified infrastructure includes the following:
viewdrivers[.]com (prev. 188.116.36[.]155, 45.153.240[.]222)
service1updater[.]com (prev. 185.117.75[.]193, 45.153.240[.]178)

We identified several additional possible Ryuk domains based on consistencies with Incident
20200930A. At least two of the domains were also identified in behavioral information for
Cobalt Strike executables, similar to those in the aforementioned Incident. The domains’
consistencies include naming similarities, registration through NameCheap, and reuse of the
same CIDR blocks for hosting. It should be noted that those consistencies are not unique
and most of the identified infrastructure is not hosted on ASNs seen in the previous
infrastructure and SSL certificates have not been created for most of the domains. New SSL
certificates or relevant malicious file behavior consistent with the previously identified
infrastructure would help increase our confidence in the assessed relationship to Ryuk.

ThreatConnect Research Team Intelligence: Items recently created or updated in the
ThreatConnect Common Community by our Research Team.
20201021A: Additional Probable Ryuk Infrastructure ThreatConnect Research
identified several probable Ryuk domains based on consistencies with infrastructure
identified in Incident 20200930A: Domains Registered Through MonoVM Used with
Cobalt Strike and other recent incidents.
20201019A: Additional Ryuk Infrastructure ThreatConnect Research identified several
most likely Ryuk domains registered on October 14 and 15 2020 based on
consistencies with infrastructure identified in Incident 20200930A: Domains Registered
Through MonoVM Used with Cobalt Strike and other recent Ryuk Incidents.
20201019B: Suspicious Microsoft and ESET Spoofing Domains Hosted at
45.147.231[.]188 ThreatConnect Research identified two suspicious domains that
spoof Microsoft and ESET respectively. One domain was registered through
NameCheap on June 26 2019, while the other was registered through NameCheap on
October 15 2020. Both domains began resolving to a probable dedicated server in mid
October 2020.
