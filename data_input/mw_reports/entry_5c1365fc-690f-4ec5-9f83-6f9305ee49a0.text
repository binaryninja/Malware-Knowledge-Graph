About Cobalt Strike
Raphael Mudge created Cobalt Strike in 2012 to enable threat-representative security tests.
Cobalt Strike was one of the first public red team command and control frameworks. In 2020,
HelpSystems acquired Cobalt Strike to add to its Core Security portfolio and pair with Core
Impact. Today, Cobalt Strike is the go-to red team platform for many U.S. government, large
business, and consulting organizations.
