Intro
According to the Chinese zodiac 2020 is the year of the RAT, and in accordance with the
myth the rat tricked his adversary in order to be ahead of him and “win the race”. The RAT
mindset is also a growing trend that ThreatFabric analysts have observed in mobile banking
Trojans over the last years. This blog provides an overview of the changes that took place in
the last months on the mobile banking threat landscape and describes why we can expect an
increase in the use of Remote Access Trojans for fraudulent purposes.
Play on words aside, in the world of malware the term RAT stands for Remote Access
Trojan. This functionality can be added to malware in order to provide the criminal operator
the same degree of (remote) control of the infected device as its owner/user has.
Remote access can be achieved in different ways, for example by using more-or-less native
services such as SSH (Secure Shell) or RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol), or even by using
third-party software such as TeamViewer, VNC or RAdmin. We want to stress that those
tools by themselves are not inherently malicious and are in most cases used for legitimate
purposes, such as providing users with support or perform remote administration (hence

2/36

calling this type of utilities Remote Administration Tools which can cause confusion). Some
malicious actors prefer to develop their own code/tools with the hope to remain under the
radar while benefiting of similar functionality.
Historically, mobile banking malware was designed and used primarily to access and steal
information that facilitates financial fraud. Examples of such information include second
factors of authentication (SMS, mTAN) and other secrets that could be used to perform fraud
through the targeted banking services. As fraud detection mechanisms used by financial
institutions evolved it became harder for criminals to use aforementioned methods without
being detected.
Threat actors have conceived diverse ways to circumvent detection mechanisms by
impersonating the victim’s device. A famous one is the use of a back-connect proxy on the
infected device combined with device fingerprints, allowing the actor’s device to look like the
“real” one. Solutions like device binding and fingerprinting allowed financials to detect such
techniques, therefore criminals had to innovate again. In this situation RATs are criminals’
Holy Grail, as they offer the ability to perform fraudulent transactions directly from the
infected (victim) device. By doing so, criminals are making it substantially harder to detect
fraudulent transactions without a client-based detection solution.
In Android banking malware, the RAT capability has not been commonly used due to
limitations of the Android operating system (it requires use of the Accessibility Service).
Nevertheless, back in 2016 the “Retefe” threat actors were already observed making use of
RAT functionality by abusing the TeamViewer application, giving them full control over the
infected device. As Retefe is run by a group of experienced Windows malware actors and
because RAT capabilities are quite common in Windows banking malware, the actors
probably decided to reuse that approach with Android devices as well.
Threat actors motivated by financial gain have noticed the shift of consumers from desktop
towards mobile based online banking. This trend has also resulted in the evolution of mobile
malware in order to bypass detection measures. From simple SMS-stealer to fully-fledged
RAT with Automated Transaction Systems, criminals continuously innovate to try to remain
successful. Hereafter is an overview of recent changes made by some key players in the
Android banking malware threat landscape.

Cerberus
The Cerberus banking Trojan that appeared on the threat landscape end of June 2019 has
taken over from the infamous Anubis Trojan as major rented banking malware. While offering
a feature-set that enables successful exfiltration of personally identifiable information (PII)
from infected devices, Cerberus was still lacking features that could help lowering the
detection barrier during the abuse of stolen information and fraud. Mid-January 2020, after
new-year celebrations, Cerberus authors came back with a new variant that aimed to resolve
that problem, a RAT feature to perform fraud from the infected device.
3/36

This new Cerberus variant has undergone refactoring of the code base and updates of the
C2 communication protocol, but most notably it got enhanced with the RAT capability,
possibility to steal device screen-lock credentials (PIN code or swipe pattern) and 2FA
tokens from the Google Authenticator application.
The RAT service is able to traverse the file system of the device and download its contents.
On top of that it can also launch TeamViewer and setup connections to it, providing threat
actors full remote access of the device.
Once TeamViewer is working, it provides actors with many possibilities, including changing
device settings, installing or removing apps, but most notably using any app on the device
(such as banking apps, messengers and social network apps). It can also provide valuable
insight into victim’s behavior and habits; in case it would be used for espionage purposes.
The following snippet shows the code responsible for TeamViewer login and initialization:

4/36

String runningPackage = this.lowerPkgName;
if(getNodeFromEvent.contains("com.teamviewer.host.market")) {
AccessibilityNodeInfo username = AcccesibilityUtils.getNodeFromEvent(event,
"com.teamviewer.host.market:id/host\_assign\_device_username");
AccessibilityNodeInfo password = AcccesibilityUtils.getNodeFromEvent(event,
"com.teamviewer.host.market:id/host\_assign\_device_password");
AccessibilityNodeInfo submit = AcccesibilityUtils.getNodeFromEvent(event,
"com.teamviewer.host.market:id/host\_assign\_device\_submit\_button");
if(username != null) {
this.teamviewerUsername = this.utils.readShPrStr(this,
this.strings.connect_teamviewer);
if(!this.teamviewerUsername.isEmpty()) {
this.teamviewerPassord = this.utils.readShPrStr(this,
this.strings.password);
this.credsSubmitted = false;
this.passwordFilled = false;
this.userFilled = false;
this.permissionStatus = 0;
this.utils.writeShPrStr(this, this.strings.connect_teamviewer, "");
this.utils.writeShPrStr(this, this.strings.password, "");
}
}
if(this.permissionStatus == 0) {
AccessibilityNodeInfo v7\_7 = AcccesibilityUtils.getNodeFromEvent(event,
"com.teamviewer.host.market:id/action\_bar_root");
if(v7_7 != null && AcccesibilityUtils.getNodeFromEvent(event,
"com.teamviewer.host.market:id/buttonPanel") != null) {
this.permissionStatus = 1;
AccessibilityNodeInfo tmButton =
AcccesibilityUtils.getNodeFromEvent(event, "android:id/button1");
if(tmButton != null) {
this.acc_utils.clickButton(tmButton);
}
AccessibilityNodeInfo klmCheckBox =
AcccesibilityUtils.getNodeFromEvent(event, "com.samsung.klmsagent:id/checkBox1");
AccessibilityNodeInfo klmConfirm =
AcccesibilityUtils.getNodeFromEvent(event, "com.samsung.klmsagent:id/btn_confirm");
if(klmCheckBox != null && this.permissionStatus == 1) {
this.acc_utils.clickButton(klmCheckBox);
this.acc_utils.clickButton(klmConfirm);
this.permissionStatus = 2;
Utils utils = this.utils;
utils.launchPkg(this, "com.teamviewer.host.market");
}
}
}
if(!this.teamviewerUsername.isEmpty() && !this.teamviewerPassord.isEmpty()) {
if(username != null && !this.userFilled) {
this.acc_utils.setInput(username, this.teamviewerUsername);
this.userFilled = true;
}

5/36

if(password != null && !this.passwordFilled) {
this.acc_utils.setInput(password, this.teamviewerPassord);
this.passwordFilled = true;
}
if((this.userFilled) && (this.passwordFilled) && !this.credsSubmitted) {
this.permissionStatus = 0;
this.acc_utils.clickButton(submit);
this.credsSubmitted = true;
String v0_9 = this.utils.readShPrStr(this, this.strings.hidden);
if(v0_9.equals("true")) {
this.goBack();
}
}
}
}

The feature enabling theft of device’s screen lock credentials (PIN and lock pattern) is
powered by a simple overlay that will require the victim to unlock the device. From the
implementation of the RAT we can conclude that this screen-lock credential theft was built in
order for the actors to be able to remotely unlock the device in order to perform fraud when
the victim is not using the device. This once more shows the creativity of criminals to build
the right tools to be successful.
Abusing the Accessibility privileges, the Trojan can now also steal 2FA codes from Google
Authenticator application. When the app is running, the Trojan can get the content of the
interface and can send it to the C2 server. Once again, we can deduce that this functionality
will be used to bypass authentication services that rely on OTP codes.
This is an example of what the Google Authenticator application looks like:

6/36

Until now, the end of February 2020, no advertisement for these features has yet been made
in underground forums. Therefore, we believe that this variant of Cerberus is still in the test
phase but might be released soon. Having an exhaustive target list including institutions from
all over the world, combined with its new RAT capability, Cerberus is a critical risk for
financials offering online banking services. Whether in its target list or not, it is easy for its
operators to enhance the list to target additional apps (refer to the appendix for the current
target list).

7/36

Gustuff
The Gustuff banking Trojan, first spotted in 2016, went through quite a long journey of
enhancements since its appearance on the threat landscape. Although originally built based
on the infamous Marcher malware, it went through a major refactoring, introducing
considerable changes in its architecture and feature set.
To the best of our knowledge, Gustuff was the first Android banking Trojan that heavily relied
on Android’s Accessibility Service to power its RAT functionality. The RAT was originally
implemented to lower detection of fraud but was later enhanced to facilitate automated and
large-scale fraud from the infected devices. Unlike Cerberus, Gustuff’s RAT doesn’t use
third-party utilities but uses a home-made JSON-based text protocol instead, to both
visualize and interact with content of the infected device’s interface.
In April 2019 the actors behind the Gustuff Trojan started developing a new version of the bot
alongside the original one in “production”, resulting in the original Trojan being slowly phased
out to make place for the new one. Although this process was slow, the new variant started
replacing the old one extensively from August 2019 on. After several weeks the swap
between versions was finished. Whilst keeping most of the codebase, the new variant of
Gustuff introduced changes in the architecture and command handling and added some new
features such as keylogging, browser overlays and even an ATS (Automated Transaction
System) on top of the RAT.
Although technically being an overlay attack, browser overlays closely resemble the
infamous “webfakes” (popular technique used by Windows banking malware), as instead of
checking the package name of running apps, the Trojan abuses Accessibility privileges to
check contents of the browser’s address bar to determine if the victim is accessing a website
from the target list. The browser ends up being overlayed, tricking the victim into interacting
with a fake web page.
One of the first browser overlays built by the Gustuff actors was the public Australian
government login page:

8/36

Unlike Cerberus, Gustuff is operated privately and has its main focus on Australian and
Canadian banks. Targeting financial institutions, crypto-wallets but also government websites
and job seeking platforms in order to collect more personal information from the victims (see
the appendix for targets).
Gustuff was the first Android banking Trojan observed to include an ATS, making it more
advanced and efficient compared to other similar bankers. The Automated Transaction
System will operate quasi-automatically by stealing victim’s credentials, logging in to its
9/36

account to verify validity of credentials and availability of funds, and later logging in again to
setup and perform fraudulent transactions, all from the victim’s device. Due to its
technological stand and focus, the Gustuff trojan is a major threat to all targeted parties in its
target list.

Hydra
Having its roots as a “dropper services” as described in our BianLian blog, Hydra went a long
way from using outdated overlay attack techniques, to a fully capable banking malware.
Although still having such capability, starting from February 2019, Hydra is no longer used as
dropper but as a functional and stand-alone banking Trojan.
It features screencast capabilities (like the Anubis Trojan), enabling actors to visualize what
is happening on the device in real-time, but also a back-connect proxy option, enabling
actors to impersonate the infected device and use it to perform fraud. Some other features
include remote app installation, remote screen locking and the possibility to use Google
firebase as command handler.
The following screenshots show some of the overlays used against banks operating in
Turkey:

10/36

Hydra is operated privately and until recently was targeting exclusively banks operating in
Turkey and some crypto wallet applications. Beginning 2020, the actors expanded the list of
targets to include applications from major banks all around the world (see the appendix for
targets). Taking into consideration the ongoing evolution of the Trojan, the expansion of the
target list could either mean that the actors decided to grow their fraud opportunity or that
they are planning to enter the malware rental market.
Expanding the target list to more countries and more institutions will also pose new
challenges for this Trojan; it means trying to remain undetected by a large spectrum of
malware and fraud detection solutions.
The next important step for Hydra to be successful internationally will be to add a RAT
functionality to its payload. Due to the well-thought-of modular architecture of the bot, actors
will certainly be able deal with such enhancements pretty easily; one more reason to keep an
eye on it!

11/36

Ginp
Ginp appeared on the threat landscape in the second half of 2019 as a simple SMS stealer,
completely written from scratch. It is not unusual to see actors attempt to create new
malware now and then, but in this particular case the malware started to evolve rapidly,
going through frequent development cycles.
In the months following its first appearance, it has adopted techniques used by mature
banking malware, sometimes even reusing code snippets from existing malware such as
Anubis. By fall 2019, Ginp was already a fully-fledged banking Trojan, capable of performing
credit card and credential theft using overlay attacks.
The frequency at which this Trojan is evolving is quite surprising: authors have issued more
than 10 different variants of the bot in 4 months. Here we highlight the important mutations
that Ginp took in that time span:

Another aspect that makes Ginp stand out is the Modus Operandi of its overlay attacks. As
visible in the following screenshots of overlays, a remarkable differentiator of Ginp is that all
its overlay screens for banking apps consist of at least two steps. The first page of the
overlay is used to steal the login credentials, the second one to steal the credit card details.
The social-engineering trick is encouraging the victim to “validate” its identity and therefore
provide all the previously mentioned information.
The following screenshots show a set of overlays used by Ginp:

16/36

So far authors of the Trojan seemed to keep the Trojan private. The actual narrow and very
focused target list (see appendix) indicate a certain knowledge and interest in Spanish
banks, which could indicate authors’ familiarity with the country.
Although capable of stealing basic personal information from victims, Ginp is yet still lacking
functionality when it comes to remaining undetected while performing fraud. Although there
is an actual gap, looking at how fast and frequent new versions of the Ginp Trojan are
released, there is a high chance that the challenge will be taken care of soon. We can expect
Ginp to evolve further in order to circumvent fraud detection measures and therefore also
offer functions such as screencast, back connect proxy and possibly even RAT.

Update 10/03/2020
At the end of February the actors behind Ginp added screen capture capabilities to their
Trojan. Like previously added functionality, the code is borrowed from the leaked Anubis
Trojan source code. It enables the bot to stream screenshots and send them to the C2 so
that actors can see what is happening on the screen of the infected device.

Anubis
Although no longer officially supported since the conviction of its author, Anubis is still a
common choice of criminals when it comes to Android banking malware. Since both client
and server source code are publicly accessible for free, this does not come as a surprise.
Some of the new users even made changes to it, fixing the bugs and gradually improving
some aspects of the Trojan to sell or rent it in underground forums.
Even though some changes have been observed in certain Anubis campaigns, no major
changes have been introduced by those secondary sellers. Most changes are either fixes of
known issues or improvements of existing features (such as automatic disabling of Google
Play Protect). In January 2020 a new sales post appeared in some underground forum
offering a modified version of Anubis 2.5 actually promising a RAT feature:

17/36

Translation:
Additionally, at the moment we develop VNC (commonly used as a synonym for RAT in the
malware community). It will be implemented in the coming month. Persons, who supported
the service by purchasing the bot, will be granted a chance to work as our partners, build will
cost around 15k. Maybe a little less.
With VNC implemented, bot will install an app from the Google Play store on the victim’s
device and after that you will get an access code. The victim will be able to see when you are
accessing the device, it is not possible to hide that process in Android. However, we will add
the feature that will allow disabling the screenlock. If the screen of the device is locked, bot
will receive the command to unblock the device. After that you can connect to the phone and
perform necessary transactions. It should be OK for nighttime; you shouldn’t have any
problems.
I accept your requests to add any feature to the bot. We will discuss prices individually.
Injects will happen once in 3-4 months.
Judging by this humble and not very technical description, it seems that the actors behind
this post chose an implementation similar to how Cerberus is offering its RAT feature: using a
third-party application to control the infected device. Although this statement should be taken
with caution (there is no honor among the thieves), there is a high chance we will see new
variants of the Anubis Trojan offering a fully-fledged RAT, keeping the malware relevant in
the current threat landscape.

Conclusion
The arrest in April 2019 of “maza-in”, author of the Anubis Trojan, caused a shortage of
rented and supported Android banking Trojan in the mobile threat landscape. It resulted in
many actors staying low and scared, unable to use a convenient banking Trojan. Anubis

18/36

followed the fate of Exobot and GMBot, becoming a free publicly available banking malware
that was shadowed by commercial products.
The aforementioned calm, however, didn’t last for long. Shortly after discontinuity of the
Anubis malware rental service, a new successful commercial service appeared which is
operational to this date - Cerberus. In addition, some actors chose to start development of
their own banking Trojans, resulting in new malware such as Ginp.
Existing banking Trojans have continued evolving in order to remain relevant and successful.
Creative and inventive, certain threat actors have been able to enhance their malicious tools
to remain under the radar while growing fraud revenue. Gustuff and Hydra are good
examples of such with their own view on implementation of Automated Transaction Systems
and Remote Access.
This year we can expect the threat landscape to evolve further, with new banking malware
families appearing and older ones being enhanced with new capabilities. It seems that in
order to keep up with contemporary fraud detection solutions and successfully perform fraud,
malware authors will continue implementing features that facilitate on-device fraud. More
than ever, a clear overview and understanding of the threat landscape is crucial, and tools to
detect the presence of such malware on devices have become invaluable to avoid fraud.

Mobile Threat Intelligence
Our threat intelligence solution – MTI, provides the context and in-depth knowledge of the
past and present malware-powered threats in order to understand the future of the threat
landscape. Such intelligence, includes both the strategic overview on trends and the
