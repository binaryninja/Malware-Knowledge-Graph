Third-Party Software Was Entry Point for BackgroundCheck System Hack

Hackers broke into third-party software in 2013 to open personal records on federal
employees and contractors with access to classified intelligence, according to the
government's largest private employee investigation provider.
That software apparently was an SAP enterprise resource planning application. It’s unclear if
there was a fix available for the program flaw at the time of the attack. It’s also not clear
whether SAP—which was responsible for maintaining the application—or USIS would have
been responsible for patching the flaw.
But in the end, sensitive details on tens of thousands of national security personnel were
exposed in March 2014.
Assailants infiltrated USIS by piggybacking on an “exploit,” a glitch that can be abused by
hackers, that was “present in a widely used and highly-regarded enterprise resource
planning (‘ERP’) software package,” an internal investigation obtained by Nextgov found.

USIS officials declined to explicitly name the software application, saying they would let the
report, compiled by Stroz Friedberg, a digital forensics firm retained by USIS, speak for
itself.
The report, written in December 2014, noted: “Forensic evidence shows the cyberattacker
gained access to USIS systems through an exploit in a system managed by a third party, and
from there migrated to company managed systems. . . . Our findings were largely informed
by a variety of logs, including, firewall logs, security event logs, VPN logs, and SAP
application trace logs.”
A September 2014 letter from Stroz reported, "The initial attack vector was a vulnerability in
an application server, housed in a connected, but separate network, managed by a third
party not affiliated with USIS.” The reference to “SAP application trace logs” in the report
indicates the third party was SAP.
During the period of the hacking operation, which began in 2013 and was exposed in June
2014, 20 to 30 new critical vulnerabilities were identified in SAP’s enterprise resource
planning software.
The number of SAP vulnerabilities "would have given attackers many options to
target SAP directly,” based on how USIS deployed the ERP tool, said Richard Barger, chief
intelligence officer at ThreatConnect, a firm that tracks cyber threats. Barger is a former Army
intelligence analyst.
It is unclear which vulnerability the intruders exploited. Defects in programs used by the
government and contractors sometimes aren’t fixed for years after software developers
announce a weakness.
Referencing the Stroz report, USIS spokeswoman Ellen Davis said, "the third-party
contractor was hacked and the hacker was then able to navigate into the USIS network via
the third party’s network."
Stroz officials deferred comment to USIS.
SAP, a major IT contractor with 50,000 customer organizations worldwide, would neither
confirm nor deny allegations that assailants reached USIS through one of its systems. SAP
spokesman Mat Small said in an email, "Since we don’t comment on the specifics of any
customer engagement without their explicit consent, SAP is unable to make a statement on
the situation.”
Addressing SAP’s response to security vulnerabilities, he added, "No company is more
committed to data privacy and security than SAP, and we respond rapidly, vigorously and
thoroughly when potential security risks are identified.”

The targeting of middlemen and downstream suppliers has become common in sophisticated
hacking campaigns, according to researchers.
The top three sectors victimized by cyber espionage last year were professional services
firms, which typically support large organizations; manufacturing; and government, according
to an annual Verizon data breach investigations study released last month.
Computer snoops have learned it is easier to compromise “the partner and the third party
dealing with that intellectual property than the source of the intellectual property itself," Jay
Jacobs, a Verizon senior analyst and study co-author, said at the time of the study’s
publication.
And PWC's most recent State of Cybercrime Survey found that only 22 percent of U.S.
organizations plan incident response strategies with outside suppliers.
"Not all companies recognize that supply chain vendors and business partners . . . can have
lower—even nonexistent—cybersecurity policies and practices, a situation that can increase
cybercrime risks across any entity that partner or supplier touches,” according to the survey,
which came out a year ago.
