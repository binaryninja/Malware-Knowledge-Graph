Bottom Line Up Front
With the rise of Initial Access Brokers and threat actors selling remote access to
compromised networks, Remote Monitoring and Management tools are becoming a
lucrative target
KELA noticed a cybercrime actor operating on a Russian-speaking forum, who lately
offered dozens of accesses via an RMM tool KELA identified as Desktop Central –

Monitoring the types of network accesses offered for sale by Initial Access Brokers can
hold significant intelligence value for defenders

50 Shades of Network Access
Remote monitoring and management (RMM) software is designed to help IT professionals
manage networks – and as such, offer access and elevated permissions into multiple
machines. As one can imagine, that kind of access may be very attractive to bad actors –
and MSPs, the main driving force of RMM usage, have not escaped the targeting of
ransomware actors. Lately, KELA noticed RMM software being targeted as part of the
compromise portfolio of certain initial access brokers – either directly or via managed
service providers.
A quick side trip, exploring the phrase “network access” as used by both KELA and threat
actors, may be due. The term itself is very loosely defined; threat actors use it to describe
multiple different vectors, permission levels and entry points. One can get an intuitive sense
of this by looking at the sub-forum dedicated to trading network access on Exploit, a major
Russian-speaking forum:

As can be seen, actors are binding together multiple vectors and technology stacks under
the phrase “access” – from SQL injection to RDP access, everything goes. Not all network
accesses are born equal, however: they vary in levels of sophistication needed to obtain the
access, as well as in operations that can be performed by the actors after establishing
persistence.
As such, actors with different monetization TTPs may be interested in different access
types. For ransomware gangs, exfiltration of data and network-wide running of scripts is the
goal – while for actors looking for PII, database access is king with endpoints being rendered
useless. This is why some cloud-based applications, or credentials to third-party services,
are a highly sought after commodity – while others may not be as interesting to actors.
Recently, KELA has observed a case that is a perfect illustration of RMM access
becoming a part of the RaaS (ransomware-as-a-service) ecosystem – showcasing
exactly why MSPs have become a prime target for actors.

Straight from the Horse’s Mouth

2/9

In September 2020, a threat actor posted 36 accesses for sale on a Russian-speaking
underground forum. The new accesses are being sold for a cumulative price of
$98,400 (in addition, for some accesses, the threat actor asked to suggest a price).
Prior to this bunch of accesses, the actor was selling more than a dozen accesses in July,
turning the total numbers to 53 accesses for a cumulative price of $153,850. So far, the actor
managed to sell 10 accesses; they initially cost $33,800.

Description of the type of access offered for sale

Based on KELA’s analysis of multiple posts shared by the threat actor, the targeted RMM
software seems to be parts of the ManageEngine product suite developed by Zoho
Corporation – and specifically Desktop Central .
Examining some of Desktop Central’s capabilities tells a pretty good story about why it would
be attractive to threat actors – and particularly for ransomware gangs. It allows multiple
operations to be carried out on the network, including remote control of hosts and – maybe
most importantly – running custom scripts remotely on groups of endpoint devices.

With multiple ransomware families depending on human-operated running of Powershell
scripts, for example, it’s easy to understand why RMM access would be appealing: it can
allow for network-wide ransomware deployment without having to bypass any pesky
Windows network protections, serving as a perfect living-off-the-land technique in the cloud.
In two cases with the most expensive accesses offered by the threat actor, KELA
managed to identify the victims and indirectly confirm they were using the software in
question. The first target is a Turkish company with a revenue of $221 Million (the access
cost 1.5 BTC). The second victim is a Canadian corporation with a revenue of $338 Million,
whose access has been sold in a few hours – it was offered for 1 BTC.

But How?
After establishing that Desktop Central seems to have been the vector to access obtained to
over 30 organizations, the question is: how was the RMM compromised?
Generally speaking, two possible hypotheses exist:
5/9

1. An MSP hack: one (or more) MSP has been compromised, through which actors have
obtained access to RMM software installed in the clients’ environments – allowing direct
network access;
2. Direct targeting: organizations’ Desktop Central instances were compromised directly –
for example, via phishing, credentials harvesting or social engineering.
Trying to narrow down the options, KELA examined the prevalence of Desktop Central
intances on the internet as reflected by Shodan. With almost 900 servers traced at the time
of writing this blog, the RMM platform does seem to make a decent target – providing a wide
net to cast for actors trying to obtain credentials for these cloud instances.

Examining the actors’ victimology based on the data shared, it appears that while most of
the victims are US-based there’s still a wide variety of targeted geographies. The
affected companies, as claimed by the actor, come from the US, the UK, Canada, Spain,
Brazil, Portugal, and other countries. They include organizations from the IT, education,

construction, manufacturing, law, healthcare, and other sectors. He also offered a couple of
accesses related to the government organizations, specifically, in the U.S. (Arkansas state)
and Barbados.
Intuitively speaking, this may suggest that the centralized MSP hack is less plausible
due to the geographic spread of victims (unless, of course, more than one MSP was
targeted), tilting the odds for direct targeting or exploitation.

This is not the first time Desktop Central is being targeted: a remote code execution
vulnerability (CVE-2020-10189) was reported to have been exploited in attacks designed to
drop malware in March 2020. While the vulnerability seems unrelated to the accessees
discussed in this post (as they seem to employ legitimate credentials to access the
software), it still showcases the interest in RMM software as a vector.
Update: October 8, 2020
Following this blog post and media exposure, the Zoho Corporation’s information security
team proactively reached out to KELA in order to investigate the potential incidents. KELA
was able to identify several victims as described in the threat actors’ RMM sales posts – and
provided Zoho with the attributed victims; upon investigation, Zoho concluded that the
identified victims seem to have utilized weak credentials to their ManageEngine products,
which seems to be the root cause for the compromise. A potential hypothesis made early in
the process, regarding the threat actor exploiting CVE-2020-10189 in order to create shadow
accounts or persistent backdoors, was determined unlikely based on the victims
investigated.
A response summarizing the investigation by the Zoho team reads:
8/9

With the current evidence, we strongly suspect that the usage of weak credentials is the
cause of the attack, so we have:
1. Deployed live-changes that address the problem by preventing any future logins with the
weak credentials.
2. Issued security guidance advisory to all our customers to help them ensure proper security
measures are implemented in their installations.
KELA will continue to monitor the actors’ activity and claimed victims in order to try and
identify further TTPs used for the compromises. Whether the root cause is indeed weak
credentials as concluded by Zoho, or may involve spear-phishing or other credential
extraction methods, we recommend defenders to pay attention to the cloud attack surface
expanded by internet-facing applications – as they sure do seem to attract bad actors.
