Conti Ransomware
SUMMARY
March 9, 2022: this joint CSA was updated to include
indicators of compromise (see below) and the United
States Secret Service as a co-author.
Updated February 28, 2022:

Immediate Actions You Can Take Now to
Protect Against Conti Ransomware
•
•
•

Use multifactor authentication.
Segment and segregate networks and
functions.
Update your operating system and
software.

Conti cyber threat actors remain active and reported Conti ransomware attacks against U.S. and
international organizations have risen to more than 1000. Notable attack vectors include Trickbot and
Cobalt Strike (see below for details).
While there are no specific or credible cyber threats to the U.S. homeland at this time, CISA, FBI,
NSA, and the United States Secret Service (USSS) encourage organizations to review this advisory
and apply the recommended mitigations.
(end of update)
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) have observed the increased use of Conti ransomware in more than 400 attacks on U.S. and
international organizations. (See FBI Flash: Conti Ransomware Attacks Impact Healthcare and First
Responder Networks.) In typical Conti ransomware attacks, malicious cyber actors steal files, encrypt
servers and workstations, and demand a ransom payment.

(ATT&CK®) framework, version 9. See the ATT&CK for Enterprise for all referenced threat actor
tactics and techniques.

TECHNICAL DETAILS
While Conti is considered a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model ransomware variant, there is
variation in its structure that differentiates it from a typical affiliate model. It is likely that Conti
developers pay the deployers of the ransomware a wage rather than a percentage of the proceeds
from a successful attack.
Conti actors often gain initial access [TA0001] to networks through:
•

Spearphishing campaigns using tailored emails that contain malicious attachments
[T1566.001] or malicious links [T1566.002];
o Malicious Word attachments often contain embedded scripts that can be used to
download or drop other malware—such as TrickBot and IcedID, and/or Cobalt Strike—
to assist with lateral movement and later stages of the attack life cycle with the
eventual goal of deploying Conti ransomware.[1],[2],[3]

•
•
•
•
•

Stolen or weak Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) credentials [T1078];[4]
Phone calls;
Fake software promoted via search engine optimization;
Other malware distribution networks (e.g., ZLoader); and
Common vulnerabilities in external assets.

In the execution phase [TA0002], actors run a getuid payload before using a more aggressive
payload to reduce the risk of triggering antivirus engines. CISA and FBI have observed Conti actors
using Router Scan, a penetration testing tool, to maliciously scan for and brute force [T1110] routers,
cameras, and network-attached storage devices with web interfaces. Additionally, actors use
Kerberos attacks [T1558.003] to attempt to get the Admin hash to conduct brute force attacks.
Conti actors are known to exploit legitimate remote monitoring and management software and remote
desktop software as backdoors to maintain persistence [TA0003] on victim networks.[5] The actors
use tools already available on the victim network—and, as needed, add additional tools such as
Windows Sysinternals and Mimikatz—to obtain users’ hashes and clear-text credentials, which
enable the actors to escalate privileges [TA0004] within a domain and perform other post-exploitation
and lateral movement tasks [TA0008]. In some cases, the actors also use TrickBot malware to carry
out post-exploitation tasks.

TLP:WHITE
According to a recently leaked threat actor “playbook,”[6] Conti actors also exploit vulnerabilities in
unpatched assets, such as the following, to escalate privileges [TA0004] and move laterally [TA0008]
across a victim’s network:
•
•
•

2017 Microsoft Windows Server Message Block 1.0 server vulnerabilities;[7]
"PrintNightmare" vulnerability (CVE-2021-34527) in Windows Print spooler service;[8] and
"Zerologon" vulnerability (CVE-2020-1472) in Microsoft Active Directory Domain Controller
systems.[9]

Artifacts leaked with the playbook identify four Cobalt Strike server Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
Conti actors previously used to communicate with their command and control (C2) server.
•
•
•
•

162.244.80[.]235
85.93.88[.]165
185.141.63[.]120
82.118.21[.]1

CISA and FBI have observed Conti actors using different Cobalt Strike server IP addresses unique to
different victims.
Conti actors often use the open-source Rclone command line program for data exfiltration [TA0010].
After the actors steal and encrypt the victim's sensitive data [T1486], they employ a double extortion
technique in which they demand the victim pay a ransom for the release of the encrypted data and
threaten the victim with public release of the data if the ransom is not paid.

MITIGATIONS
CISA, FBI, and NSA recommend that network defenders apply the following mitigations to reduce the
risk of compromise by Conti ransomware attacks.

Use multifactor authentication.
•

Require multifactor authentication to remotely access networks from external sources.

Implement network segmentation and filter traffic.
•

•
•

•

Implement and ensure robust network segmentation between networks and functions to
reduce the spread of the ransomware. Define a demilitarized zone that eliminates unregulated
communication between networks.
Filter network traffic to prohibit ingress and egress communications with known malicious IP
addresses.
Enable strong spam filters to prevent phishing emails from reaching end users. Implement a
user training program to discourage users from visiting malicious websites or opening
malicious attachments. Filter emails containing executable files to prevent them from reaching
end users.
Implement a URL blocklist and/or allowlist to prevent users from accessing malicious
websites.

Scan for vulnerabilities and keep software updated.
•
•

Set antivirus/antimalware programs to conduct regular scans of network assets using up-todate signatures.
Upgrade software and operating systems, applications, and firmware on network assets in a
timely manner. Consider using a centralized patch management system.

Remove unnecessary applications and apply controls.
•

Remove any application not deemed necessary for day-to-day operations. Conti threat actors
leverage legitimate applications—such as remote monitoring and management software and

TLP:WHITE
remote desktop software applications—to aid in the malicious exploitation of an organization’s
enterprise.
Investigate any unauthorized software, particularly remote desktop or remote monitoring and
management software.
Implement application allowlisting, which only allows systems to execute programs known and
permitted by the organization's security policy. Implement software restriction policies (SRPs)
or other controls to prevent programs from executing from common ransomware locations,
such as temporary folders supporting popular internet browsers or
compression/decompression programs.
Implement execution prevention by disabling macro scripts from Microsoft Office files
transmitted via email. Consider using Office Viewer software to open Microsoft Office files
transmitted via email instead of full Microsoft Office suite applications.
See the joint Alert, Publicly Available Tools Seen in Cyber Incidents Worldwide—developed by
CISA and the cybersecurity authorities of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United
Kingdom—for guidance on detection and protection against malicious use of publicly available
tools.

Implement endpoint and detection response tools.
•

Endpoint and detection response tools allow a high degree of visibility into the security status
of endpoints and can help effectively protect against malicious cyber actors.

Limit access to resources over the network, especially by restricting RDP.
•

After assessing risks, if RDP is deemed operationally necessary, restrict the originating
sources and require multifactor authentication.

Secure user accounts.
•
•

Regularly audit administrative user accounts and configure access controls under the
principles of least privilege and separation of duties.
Regularly audit logs to ensure new accounts are legitimate users.

Review CISA’s APTs Targeting IT Service Provider Customers guidance for additional mitigations
specific to IT Service Providers and their customers.

Use the Ransomware Response Checklist in case of infection.
If a ransomware incident occurs at your organization, CISA, FBI, and NSA recommend the following
actions:
•
•

Follow the Ransomware Response Checklist on p. 11 of the CISA-Multi-State Information
Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide.
Scan your backups. If possible, scan your backup data with an antivirus program to check
that it is free of malware.

Page 8 of 10 | Product ID: AA21-265A

TLP:WHITE

CISA | FBI | NSA | USSS

•
•

TLP:WHITE
Report incidents immediately to CISA at https://us-cert.cisa.gov/report, a local FBI Field
Office, or U.S. Secret Service Field Office.
Apply incident response best practices found in the joint Advisory, Technical Approaches
to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity, developed by CISA and the cybersecurity
authorities of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.

CISA, FBI, and NSA strongly discourage paying a ransom to criminal actors. Paying a ransom may
embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in
the distribution of ransomware, and/or may fund illicit activities. Paying the ransom also does not
guarantee that a victim’s files will be recovered.
