Infrastructure

Over the last half a decade, Russian state-sponsored hackers have triggered blackouts in
Ukraine, released history's most destructive computer worm, and stolen and leaked emails
from Democratic targets in an effort to help elect Donald Trump. In that same stretch, one
particular group of Kremlin-controlled hackers has gained a reputation for a very different
habit: walking right up to the edge of cybersabotage—sometimes with hands-on-the-switches
access to US critical infrastructure—and stopping just short.
Last week the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency published an advisory warning that a group known as Berserk Bear—or alternately
Energetic Bear, TEMP.Isotope, and Dragonfly—had carried out a broad hacking campaign
against US state, local, territorial, and tribal government agencies, as well as aviation sector
targets. The hackers breached the networks of at least two of those victims. The news of
those intrusions, which was reported earlier last week by the news outlet Cyberscoop,
presents the troubling but unconfirmed possibility that Russia may be laying the groundwork
to disrupt the 2020 election with its access to election-adjacent local government IT systems.

In the context of Berserk Bear's long history of US intrusions, though, it's much harder to
gauge the actual threat it poses. Since as early as 2012, cybersecurity researchers have
been shocked to repeatedly find the group's fingerprints deep inside infrastructure around the
globe, from electric distribution utilities to nuclear power plants. Yet those researchers also
say they've never seen Berserk Bear use that access to cause disruption. The group is a bit
like Chekhov's gun, hanging on the wall without being fired through all of Act I—and
foreshadowing an ominous endgame at a critical moment for US democracy.
"What makes them unique is the fact that they have been so focused on infrastructure
throughout their existence, whether it's mining, oil, and natural gas in different countries or
the grid," says Vikram Thakur, a researcher at security firm Symantec who has tracked the
group over several distinct hacking campaigns since 2013. And yet Thakur notes that in all
that time, he's only seen the hackers carry out what appear to be reconnaissance operations.
They gain access and steal data, but despite ample opportunity never actually exploit
sensitive systems to attempt to cause a blackout, plant data-destructive malware, or deploy
any other sort of cyberattack payload.
Instead, the intruders seem content simply demonstrating that they can gain that troubling
level of reach into infrastructure targets again and again. "I see them having operated for
seven years and till today, I've come across no evidence of them having done something,"
Thakur says. "And that makes me lean toward the theory that they're sending a message: I
am in your critical infrastructure space, and I can come back if I want to."
A Long Hibernation
In the summer of 2012, Adam Meyers, the vice president of intelligence at security firm
CrowdStrike, remembers first coming across the group's sophisticated backdoor malware,
known as Havex, in an energy sector target in the Caucasus region. (CrowdStrike initially
called the hackers Energetic Bear due to the energy sector targeting, but later changed the
name to Berserk Bear when the group switched up its tools and infrastructure.) "It was the
coolest thing I'd ever seen at the time," Meyers says. Crowdstrike would soon find Havex in
other energy-related networks around the world—years before other Russian hackers would
carry out the world's first blackout-inducing cyberattack in 2015 against Ukraine.
In June of 2014 Symantec published a comprehensive report on the group, which it called
Dragonfly. In dozens of intrusions against oil and gas and electric utilities in the US and
Europe, the hackers had used "watering hole" attacks that compromised websites their
targets visited to plant Havex on their machines. They also hid their malware in infected
versions of three different software tools commonly used by industrial and energy firms.
Symantec's Thakur says in that first wave of attacks the company found that the hackers had

stolen detailed industrial control system data from their victims. He never saw evidence,
however, that the hackers went so far as to attempt to disrupt any target's operations—
though given the scale of the campaign, he admits he can't be sure.
In 2017, Symantec discovered the same hackers carrying out a more targeted set of attacks
against US energy sector targets. At the time, the security researchers described it as a
"handful" of victims, but Thakur now says they numbered in the dozens, ranging from coal
mining operations to electric utilities. In some cases, Symantec found, the hackers had gone
so far as to screenshot control panels of circuit breakers, a sign that their reconnaissance
efforts had gone deep enough that they could have started "flipping switches" at will—likely
enough to cause some sort of disruption if not necessarily a sustained blackout. But again,
the hackers appear not to have taken full advantage. "We did not see them turning off the
lights anywhere," he says.
Six months later, in February of 2018, the FBI and DHS would warn that the hacking
campaign—which they named Palmetto Fusion—had been carried out by Russian statesponsored hackers, and also confirmed reports that the hackers' victims had included at
least one nuclear power generation facility. The hackers had gained access only to the
utility's IT network, though, not its far more sensitive industrial control systems.
Going Berserk
Today Berserk Bear is widely suspected of working in the service of Russia's FSB internal
intelligence agency, the successor to the Soviet-era KGB. CrowdStrike's Meyers says the
company's analysts have come to that conclusion with "pretty decent confidence," due in part
to evidence that aside from its foreign infrastructure hacking, Berserk Bear has also
periodically targeted domestic Russian entities and individuals, including political dissidents
and potential subjects of law enforcement and counterterrorism investigation, all in line with
the FSB's mission.
That's a contrast with other widely reported state-sponsored Russian hacking groups Fancy
Bear and Sandworm, who have been identified as members of Russia's GRU military
intelligence agency. Fancy Bear hackers were indicted in 2018 for breaching the Democratic
National Committee and the Clinton campaign in a hack-and-leak operation designed to
interfere with the 2016 US presidential election. Six alleged members of Sandworm were
indicted by the US Department of Justice last week in connection with cyberattacks that have
caused two blackouts in Ukraine, the NotPetya malware outbreak that inflicted $10 billion in
damage globally, and the attempted sabotage of the 2018 Winter Olympics.
Berserk Bear appears to be the FSB's more restrained version of the GRU's Sandworm
cyberwar unit, says John Hultquist, director of intelligence at FireEye. "This is an actor whose
mission appears to be to hold critical infrastructure under threat," Hultquist says. "The
difference is we've never seen them actually pull the trigger."

Just why Berserk Bear would toe the line of critical infrastructure disruption without crossing
it over so many years remains a subject of debate. Hultquist argues that the group may be
preparing for a potential future geopolitical conflict, one that warrants an act of cyberwar
such as attacking an enemy's power grid—what cybersecurity analysts have long described
as "preparing the battlefield."
The latest round of Berserk Bear breaches could be that sort of preparation, Hultquist warns,
for coming attacks on state, municipal, and other local governments responsible for
administering the current election. According to cybersecurity firm Symantec, three of
Berserk Bear's attempted operations also targeted airports on the West coast of the United
States, including San Francisco International Airport. Symantec's Thakur imagines a future
where Berserk Bear is mobilized to cause disruptive—if not necessarily disastrous—effects,
like "lights out in a small part of the country, or a certain airline has trouble refueling their
planes."
But CrowdStrike's Meyers, who has tracked Berserk Bear for eight years, says he's come to
believe that the group may be playing a more subtle game, one that has more indirect but
immediate, psychological effects. Every one of its breaches, no matter how seemingly minor,
triggers a disproportionate technical, political, and even emotional response. "If you can
make US-CERT or CISA deploy a team every time they find a Berserk Bear target, if you can
make them publish stuff for the American public and get their partners from the intelligence
community and law enforcement involved, you're basically doing a resource attack against
the machine," Meyers says, drawing an analogy with a hacker technique that overwhelms a
target computer's resources with requests. Meyers points out that last week's CISA advisory
describes widespread scanning for potential victims, not the quieter, more targeted tactics of
a group making stealth its highest priority. "The more they can run these theatrics, the more
they can make us go freaking nuts... They're getting us spun up. They're burning our cycles."
If triggering that overreaction is indeed Berserk Bear's endgame, it may have already
succeeded, given CISA's advisory about its latest round of intrusions and widespread media
coverage of those breaches—including in this article. But Myers concedes that the
alternative, ignoring or downplaying Russian state-sponsored breaches into US critical
infrastructure and election-related systems, hardly seems wise either. If indeed Berserk Bear
is Chekhov’s gun hanging on the wall, it has to go off before the play is over. But even if it
never does, it can be hard to take your eyes off of it—drawing your attention away from the
rest of the plot.
