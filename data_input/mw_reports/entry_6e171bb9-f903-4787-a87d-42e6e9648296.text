Recently, we’ve found malicious code in version 3.17.18 of the official client of the APKPure
app store. The app is not on Google Play, but it is itself a quite a popular app store around
the world. Most likely, its infection is a repeat of the CamScanner incident, when the
developer implemented a new adware SDK from an unverified source.
We notified the developers about the infection on April 8. APKPure confirmed the issue and
promptly fixed it with the release of version 3.17.19.
In terms of functionality, the malicious code embedded in APKPure is standard for this type
of threat. When the app starts, the payload is decrypted and launched. In this case, it is
located in a long string in the app code.

The payload collects information about the user device and sends it to the C&C server.

Next, depending on the response received, the malware can:
Show ads when the device is unlocked.

Open browser pages with ads repeatedly.

Load additional executable modules.

3/11

In our case, a Trojan was loaded that has much in common with the notorious Triada
malware and can perform a range of actions: from displaying and clicking ads to signing up
for paid subscriptions and downloading other malware.

Depending on the OS version, the Trojan can inflict various forms of damage on the victim.
APKPure users with current Android versions mostly risk having paid subscriptions and
intrusive ads appear from nowhere. Users of smartphones who do not receive security
updates are less fortunate: in outdated versions of the OS, the malware is capable of not
only loading additional apps, but installing them on the system partition. This can result in an
unremovable Trojan like xHelper getting onto the device.

4/11

Kaspersky solutions detect the malicious implant as HEUR:TrojanDropper.AndroidOS.Triada.ap.
If you use APKPure, we recommend immediately deleting the infected app and installing the
“clean” 3.17.19 version. In addition, scan the system for other Trojans using a reliable
security solution, such as Kaspersky Internet Security for Android.

APT trends report Q1 2022
This is our latest summary of advanced persistent threat (APT) activity, focusing on events
that we observed during Q1 2022.

Lazarus Trojanized DeFi app for delivering malware
We recently discovered a Trojanized DeFi application that was compiled in November 2021.
This application contains a legitimate program called DeFi Wallet that saves and manages a
cryptocurrency wallet, but also implants a full-featured backdoor.

MoonBounce: the dark side of UEFI firmware

9/11

At the end of 2021, we inspected UEFI firmware that was tampered with to embed a
malicious code we dub MoonBounce. In this report we describe how the MoonBounce
implant works and how it is connected to APT41.

The BlueNoroff cryptocurrency hunt is still on
It appears that BlueNoroff shifted focus from hitting banks and SWIFT-connected servers to
solely cryptocurrency businesses as the main source of the group’s illegal income.
