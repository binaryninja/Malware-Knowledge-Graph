Attracting more than a half-million annual readers, this is the security community's go-to
destination for technical breakdowns of the latest threats, critical vulnerability disclosures
and cutting-edge research.
Observing the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, we can clearly see that
cyberattacks leveraging malware are an important part of modern hybrid war strategy.
While conventional warfare is conducted on the battlefield and limited by several factors,
cyber warfare continues in cyber space, offering the chance to infiltrate and damage targets
far behind the frontlines.

Russia utilized cyberattacks during the initial phase of the invasion in February. Reports
from Trustwave and other security researchers show that Russian cyberattackers have
maintained pressure launching a series of attacks showing how malware has been used
against organizations in Ukraine either to destroy or gain control over targeted systems.
In this article we will summarize some of the most prominent Russian threat actors involved
and the malware tools used in cyberattacks against Ukraine.

Russian Threat Actors Behind the Attacks in Ukraine
Despite the high level and technical sophistication of the cyberattacks, and the Russian
Special Services’ ability to cover their tracks, several traces remain present after the attacks
which leave no doubt of Russia’s involvement in the current attacks against Ukraine.
As mentioned in a report released by the Estonian Foreign Intelligence Service and a UK
government publication we can clearly draw some connections between the most notorious
threat groups involved and Russian special services.
APT29, also known as Cozy Bear or The Dukes to the Russian Foreign Intelligence
Service (SVR).
APT28, also known as Fancy Bear or Sofacy was traced to the Main Directorate of the
General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (Former GRU) Unit 26165.
SANDWORM, also known as Black Energy, was tied to the Main Directorate of the General
Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (Former GRU) Unit 74455.
DRAGONFLY, also known as Energetic Bear or Crouching Yeti was identified as the
Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) Unit 71330.
GAMAREDON, also known as Primitive Bear or Armageddon, traced to the Russian
Federal Security Service (FSB) in November 2021. The Security Service of Ukraine (SSU)
successfully identified individuals behind Gamaredon confirming their ties with FSB.

Other actively involved threat actors such as UNC2589, also known as Ember Bear or
Lorec53, and InvisiMole do not present such clear ties with Russian special services.
However, as published by ESET researchers, InvisiMole was found to be using server
infrastructure operated by Gamaredon.

Timeline of the Attacks & Malware Used
The flow timeline below illustrates the pressure placed on Ukrainian organizations and that
government infrastructure is the attacker’s primary target of the attackers. The variety of
malware used, and involvement of Russian state-sponsored threat actors makes it evident
that successful protection measures against attackers would require not only reactive but
also a proactive approach.
Looking at the type of malware used, we can distinguish between 2 lines of attacks
differentiated by the attacker's objectives:
Destructive attacks are meant to destroy the data and render targeted systems
inoperable.
Espionage attacks are designed to establish a foothold and exfiltrate data from
targeted systems. Malware used in the attacks usually provides attackers backdoor
access with webcam and microphone captures, keylogging, and possibility to
download and install additional components. Exfiltrated data includes operating
system information, documents, pictures and stored passwords from web browsers
and other software.

Initial Vectors Used in the Attacks
The flow timeline below illustrates the initial attack vectors used to deploy malware.
Spearphishing with malicious attachments or links are used to deliver CobaltStrike and
GraphSteel backdoors or exploitation of vulnerabilities in public facing applications such as
the VPN appliances compromised in the Viasat cyberattack are some of the most common
intrusion methods used. While the initial attack vector of HermeticWiper, HermeticRansom
and CaddyWiper are not entirely known, at least one security vendor reported that the
attackers appear to have exploited a known vulnerability in Microsoft SQL Server (CVE2021-1636).

Figure 4 - Initial Attack Vectors

HermeticWiper
This wiper malware was given the name “HermeticWiper” based on a stolen digital
certificate from a company called Hermetica Digital Ltd. HermeticWiper disables the Volume
Shadow Copy Service (VSS) responsible for data backup and abuses legitimate drivers
from the EaseUS Partition Master in order to corrupt data. As indicated by ESET and
confirmed by the analysis of the Trustwave SpiderLabs Security Researchers, the wiper not
only corrupts master boot record (MBR) and volume boot records, but also wipes files by
defragmenting, rendering recovery impossible. It’s worth mentioning that HermeticWiper
specifically targets Windows registry files ntuser.dat and Windows event logs to minimize
the amount of usable forensic artifacts. Finally, the system restart is triggered rendering the
targeted host inoperable.
It's interesting to note that the compilation timestamp of the HermeticWiper malware was
December 28, 2021. This suggests that the February attacks were in preparation since at
least that time.

HermeticRansom
HermeticRansom is written in Go language. As indicated by CrowdStrike’s analysis, it
enumerates available drives collecting a list of directories and files except for the Windows
and Program Files folders. Selected file categories are renamed using the ransomware
operator’s email address and .encryptedJB extension, then file contents are encrypted
using an AES algorithm. The ransomware also creates a read_me.html file in the Desktop
folder which contains a ransom note with the attackers’ contacts.
The encryption method is rather cumbersome and contains implementation errors making
encrypted files recoverable. This flaw, together with political messaging found inside and
deployment timing consistent with HermeticWiper, suggests that HermeticRansom was
likely used as a distraction rather than a legitimate ransomware extortion attempt.

IsaacWiper
As indicated by ESET analysis, IsaacWiper is entirely different from HermeticWiper from a
code perspective and is much less sophisticated. Upon execution it enumerates physical
drives and volumes overwriting the existing content with random bytes. If a volume access
is denied, the wiper creates a temporary directory and file within this directory. The name of
the directory created will begin with the letters "Tmd" and file with the letters "Tmf;” the
remaining part of the name will be randomly generated alphanumerical characters. It will
then attempt to fill it with random data until the volume is out of space. The wiper also
renames files it can't access to temporary names and then attempts to wipe the newly
renamed file. IsaacWiper creates a log file C:\ProgramData\log.txt. where corrupting activity
progress is saved.

AcidRain
As indicated by Trustwave SpiderLabs’s analysis, AcidRain overwrites files and symbolic
links with random data from the memory buffer in a recursive loop. If the wiper is executed
with root permissions certain directories such as: ‘bin,’ ‘dev,’ ‘lib,’ ‘proc,’ ’sbin ’ ’sys,’ and
‘usr’ are avoided. The same random data buffer and write operation are used to wipe disk
devices ‘/dev/sdX,’ loop devices ‘/dev/loopX,’ memory block devices ‘/dev/block/mtdblockX’
and multimedia card block devices ‘/dev/block/mmcblkX.’ Memory devices ‘/dev/mtdX’ are
wiped using MEMWRITEOOB ioctl instead. After the wiping is done a device reboot is
triggered.

Figure 5 – Reconstructed AcidRain’s Main Routine
On February 24, 2022, the day the war started, a cyber-attack against Viasat’s KA-SAT
network impacted several thousand customers in Ukraine and tens of thousands across
Europe. Spillover from this attack disabled the remote control of 5,800 Enercon wind
turbines in Germany. As reported by Viasat, the attacker exploited Skylogic's VPN
appliance gaining remote access to KA-SAT's network management segment. The attacker
moved laterally to a specific segment part used to operate the network and executed
legitimate, targeted management commands on a large number of residential modems,
simultaneously. Specifically, these destructive commands overwrote key data in the flash
memory on the SurfBeam modems.
AcidRain wiper being discovered shortly after, is a plausible fit for this attack pattern.
Analysis of SurfBeam modems’ firmware published in a Reversemode blog revealed the
possibility to install arbitrary binaries without requiring either a signature verification or a
complete firmware upgrade. Moreover, the first Virustotal submission for AcidRain’s sample
aligns with the incident investigation timeframe and Skylogic Mediterraneo infrastructure
location.

LoadEdge (InvisiMole)
As indicated by CERT-UA analysis, LoadEdge backdoor used in this campaign supports
functionalities such as file execution, upload, download and deletion, obtaining system
information, and interactive reverse shell over TCP port 1337.
Communication with the C&C server uses HTTP protocol and JSON formatted data, and
persistence is provided by the HTA file creating an entry under the Run registry key.
Drawing conclusions from the ESET research paper, LoadEdge resembles an upgraded
version of InvisiMole's TCP downloader component used to download further backdoor
modules called RC2FM and RC2CL, usually deployed as the first payload on a newly
compromised computer. InvisiMole's RC2FM and RC2CL backdoors provide extended
surveillance capabilities such as screen, webcam and microphone captures, documents
exfiltration, collecting network information, and information about installed software.

GraphSteel & GrimPlant
backdoors are both written in the Go language. As indicated by a
BitDefender report, GrimPlant is a simple backdoor allowing for remote execution of
PowerShell commands. Communication with the C2 server uses port 80 and is based on

10/17

gRPC – an open-source RPC framework. The communications are encrypted with TLS, and
its certificate is hardcoded in the binary. GrimPlant sends a heartbeat containing a basic
host information message every 10 seconds. Commands received from the C2 server are
executed using PowerShell and the result is reported back.The GraphSteel backdoor is
designed to exfiltrate data from infected machines. Communication with the C&C server
uses port 443 and is encrypted using the AES cipher. GraphQL query language is used for
communication. Files are exfiltrated from Documents, Downloads, Pictures, Desktop folders
and all available drives from D:\ to Z:\. GraphSteel also exfiltrates basic system information,
IP configuration, wifi profiles and steals credentials from the password vault using
powershell.

DoubleZero
DoubleZero is a .NET wiper malware. Our analysis indicated that execution stops
immediately if the machine is a domain controller, otherwise it enumerates all the drives
mounted to the machine and overwrites files with zero blocks, except for a specific
hardcoded list of the system locations. Then the wiper moves on to the destruction of
system files. In the end, the “lsass” process responsible for enforcing the security policy on
the system is terminated and all the subkeys in the HKLM, HKCU, and HKU registry hives
are destroyed. Once all the destructive activity has been completed, the wiper will shut
down the system.

CaddyWiper
As indicated by a Cisco Talos advisory, CaddyWiper dynamically resolves most of the APIs
used to make detection and analysis more challenging. CaddyWiper’s execution stops
immediately if the machine is a domain controller, otherwise the malware will attempt to
destroy files on "C:\Users" followed by wiping all available drives from D:\ to Z:\. This means
that any network mapped drives attached to the system may be wiped also. It wipes a
maximum of a 10MB chunk from the beginning of the file, likely as part of performance
optimization. Next the wiper attempts to zero out each physical drive corrupting master
boot record (MBR) and extended information about a drive's partitions.

AwfulShred, SoloShred
AwfulShred and SoloShred are malicious shell scripts designed to corrupt Linux systems.
Our analysis revealed that the destructive activity of both scripts relies on a shred command
with one overwrite pass, chosen to increase the data damage. AwfulShred is also
obfuscated, and its functionality is somewhat sophisticated. Prior to wiping the data, it
disables and corrupts Apache, HTTP and SSH services, deactivates the swap file, and
clears bash history. Finally, a system reboot is triggered, rendering the targeted host
inoperable.

Industroyer2
Industroyer2 is a sophisticated piece of malware targeting industrial control systems (ICS).
As indicated by Nozomi Networks’ analysis, it specifically abuses the IEC 60870-5-104 (IEC
104) protocol used in electric power control systems. Unlike its predecessor, Industroyer,
Industroyer2 is a standalone executable consisting of a backdoor, loader, and several
payload modules. Its only feature is to cause electric outages by disrupting operation of
transmission substations.
Once executed, Industroyer2 attempts to terminate legitimate processes responsible for
IEC 104 service communication: PServiceControl.exe and PService_PPD.exe, then
renames the original executables by appending the “.MZ” file extension and begins IEC 104
interaction with transmission substations, interrupting the circuit breakers operation.
Substations IP addresses and ports were found hard-coded, meaning that the attackers had
at least limited knowledge of their target.

CredoMap
CredoMap is a .NET credential stealer used by the threat actor APT28. CredoMap steals
cookies and stored passwords from Chrome, Edge and Firefox browsers. Depending on
the version, stolen data is then exfiltrated via email or HTTP POST requests to the web
backend.

DarkCrystal RAT
DarkCrystal RAT or DCRat is a commercial Russian .NET backdoor that can be purchased
in underground forums and is designed primarily to spy on victims and steal data from
compromised hosts; DCRat supports surveillance using screen and webcam captures,
keylogging as well as files and credentials theft. Other interesting features include
persistence using registry, stealing clipboard contents, command execution and DOS attack
function. DCRat communicates with the C2 server via HTTP using GET and POST
requests.

14/17

Dark Crystal RAT (DCRat) appeared at the beginning of 2019. During its operation, the RAT
got a lot of followers and clients. The malware became widely known for a variety of plugins
including Stealer, Hidden Remote Desktop, file manager, and anonymous operation (via
TOR proxy). The software was distributed on a subscription basis: two months for 600 RUB
(~9.5 USD), one year for 2500 RUB (~39 USD), and a lifelong subscription would cost you
4500 RUB (~70 USD).

Figure 8 – DarkCrystal RAT
The DCRat code has been available on GitHub since at least March 2021. The versatility of
the RAT, its abilities, and its low price make it so popular that even government-affiliated
groups were choosing it for their operations.

Cobalt Strike
15/17

Cobalt Strike is a commercial penetration testing tool that allows an attacker to deploy a
backdoor agent named 'Beacon' on the target machine. Although primarily designed for red
teams, it is actively used by a wide range of threat actors from ransomware operators to
APT groups for downloading and executing malicious payloads. The Beacon implant is fileless, in the sense that it consists of stage-less or multi-stage shellcode that is loaded either
by exploiting a vulnerability or executing a shellcode loader. Communication with the C&C
server is supported over several protocols including HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, SMB, named
pipes as well as forward and reverse TCP with a wide range of modifications. Connections
also can be established by chaining Beacons. Once an attacker gains access to a single
system inside the compromised network, it can then be used to pivot internally into other
systems.

Conclusions
Without a doubt, sophisticated cyber weapons are key tools in the arsenal of a modern
military, and the amount of global cyberwarfare will likely increase in the future.
First, with the constantly growing number of devices connected to the network, the attack
surface is becoming massive, increasing the potential use cases for cyberwarfare.
Second, cyberwarfare is not bound by the territorial constraints of conventional warfare,
offering the chance to infiltrate and damage targets far behind the frontlines.
16/17

Finally, compared to traditional warfare, cyberwarfare is invisible to the naked eye, does not
risk lives on the side of the aggressor, and is cost effective.
With Ukraine being targeted by a variety of cyberattacks, we can see that even legitimate
penetration testing tools can be hijacked and used as weapons. Cobalt Strike, originally
created to train network defenders, is being actively abused by attackers in this conflict.

Protecting and Securing Your Network
Critical infrastructure is vital for the functioning of modern societies and will always be a
lucrative target for attackers seeking monetary gain, political or military advantage.
Understanding what digital technologies and tools are used in a conflict can help identify
and mitigate future threats before the damage happens.
Unfortunately, people are usually the weakest link in the cybersecurity chain, as opening
malicious attachments or links often leads to a compromise. Effective prevention strategy
should include training programs, ensuring that personnel can identify and mitigate threats
coupled with use of secure email gateways such as Trustwave MailMarshal, anti-malware
and endpoint protection solutions.
Internet-facing systems should be always updated, protected by a firewall solution, regularly
scanned for vulnerabilities, and audited for changes to the system integrity.
Trustwave’s researchers are continuously gathering more information on the latest
cyberattacks, helping our customers to stay safe during these turbulent times.
