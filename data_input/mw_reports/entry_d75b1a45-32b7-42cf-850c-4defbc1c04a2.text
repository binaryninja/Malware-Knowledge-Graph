1. SUMMARY
After an extensive investigation, which revealed a widespread campaign targeting multiple universities,
Accenture’s iDefense unit is publishing this report to provide threat indicators and mitigation approaches to help
organizations defend themselves and ensure cyber resilience against this threat group. It’s imperative to highlight
the third-party risk and supply chain threat from advanced cyber adversaries. Organizations need to understand
that espionage actors will seek to exploit any organization within a target’s supply chain to fulfill its strategic
collection requirements.
The authors of the technical paper titled "Deliver Uncompromised: A Strategy for Supply Chain Security and Resilience
in Response to the Changing Character of War"1 draw attention to the issue of adversarial targeting of the DoD supply
chain by stating that most nation states have a full complement of technologies and resources available to achieve their
asymmetric strategies and goals as they relate to cyberespionage. They take advantage of the inherent vulnerabilities2
in the complex DoD supply chain ecosystem, namely a lack of oversight associated with operational security and siloed
threat intelligence sharing.
As referenced in the “Accenture Cyber Threatscape Report 2018,”3 supply chains are integral to the DoD as the
Department works to bring its technologies and weapon platforms to maturity. Threat actors have identified these supply
chains as effective means of infiltrating victim organizations. Even verticals like aerospace and defense, in which
companies have bought into the maintenance of mature security hygiene or in which the regulatory landscape has
forced such adoption, supply chains still present openings.

Key Findings

1

•

Based upon tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) correlations, campaign targeting, leveraged malware,
infrastructure and compelling third-party intelligence,4 iDefense analysts have moderate to high confidence that
this activity is attributed to the MUDCARP (aka “TEMP.PERISCOPE” and “Leviathan”) threat group.

•

As referenced in a recent Wall Street journal article5 MUDCARP collection requirements appear to include
several very specific submarine technologies produced by multiple cleared defense contractors (and their
respective supply chains). Any technology or program that involves the delivery or launching of a payload from
a submerged submarine, or undersea autonomous vehicles, is of high interest to MUDCARP.

•

It is likely that MUDCARP actors have targeted several cleared defense contractors, universities (both domestic
and foreign), and oceanographic institutes.

•

MUDCARP and other cyberespionage threat groups will continue to target companies, think tanks and
universities who are in the DoD supply chain as a means of stealing intellectual property and exploiting those
business relationships targeting DoD organizations.

2. MITIGATIONS & RECOMENDATIONS
Organizations can proactively defend against cyberespionage campaigns targeting supply chain assets by enforcing
policies and procedures designed to adhere to DoD supply chain requirements and best practices. According to
Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) clause 252.204-70126, “Safeguarding Covered Defense
Information and Cyber Incident Reporting”, entities which comprise the DoD supply chain, except for contracts solely for
the acquisition of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) items, have had to become National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-1717 compliant no later than December 31, 2017. This publication,
titled “Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Systems and Organizations”, provides recommended
security requirements for protecting the confidentiality of controlled unclassified information when such information is
resident in nonfederal systems and organizations.
The security requirements contained in SP 800-171 are broken down into fourteen categories or “families” which include
access control, configuration management, incident response, and risk assessment among many others. The
publication then identifies specific controls, policies, and procedures for each category that relate to the general topic of
the family. For example, under Access Control, it is requirement that the supply chain organization authorize remote
execution of privileged commands and remote access to security-relevant information. Another example, under the
Incident Response family, states that tracking, documenting and reporting incidents to designated officials both internal
and external to the targeted organization. iDefense recommends that the requirements outlined in this publication
should be immediately implemented and enforced by any company or institution producing goods or services or
conducting research on behalf of the DoD. These best practices also advertise that contractors and academic
institutions educate their employees as to the breadth, depth and scope of the adversary, and the risks imposed to
national security; doing so will help to try to ensure an environment of supplier security and resilience by incentivizing
proper security controls and threat intelligence sharing.
Regarding the detection and remediation of MUDCARP campaigns, organizations should focus on educating staff on
how to detect socially engineered e-mails and the repercussions of enabling macros in Office documents sent via email. In addition, security professionals should specifically enable alerts to detect tools and techniques frequently
utilized by MUDCARP actors. These include the delivery of malicious Microsoft Office documents exploiting the CVE2017-11882 vulnerability; the use of a custom backdoor written in JavaScript known as “Orz” that retrieves attacker
commands from compromised websites and MUDCARP-created profiles on legitimate networking sites; and “China
Chopper,” a simple Web shell designed to run on a variety of Web servers that allows an adversary to download files,
access the victim system’s Active Directory, and determine passwords via a brute-force attack.

Technical Mitigations
iDefense suggests organizations consider rapidly prioritizing Microsoft Office Suite application patching and updating
due its high popularity and constant targeting by threat groups. For example, CVE-2017-8759's patch was available on
September 12, 2018, and MUDCARP was able to deliver weaponized CVE-2017-8759 RTF documents to targets 3
days later. This 72-hour time frame is typically faster than most organizations 30-day Window for patching - leaving
them vulnerable to attacks by agile threat groups such as MUDCARP.
iDefense suggests organizations perform management of privileged accounts like the default Administrator account,
which should be disabled and removed from systems. Threat actors like MUDCARP often target users with enhanced
privileges and those users should adhere to least privilege principals by limiting their use of privileged accounts to
mitigate threat actors from exploiting their elevated permissions and authorization by enforcing role-based training and
security policies. As an example, some of the malicious MUDCARP samples identified above will not properly execute
unless the targeted victim is the Administrator user account when opening the lure documents.
iDefense suggests organizations configure its e-mail gateways to inspect DKIM Signatures, SPF & DMARC records to
detect the absence or failure of such identifiers with incoming mail - as these authentication and identification items

have not been typically observed on MUDCARP infrastructure and phishes. If these tests fail, consider appending
indicators and warnings (I&Ws) in the e-mail subject line, such as [SUSPICIOUS] or [IDENTITY-UNVERIFIED] in
addition to the normal [EXTERNAL] tag for incoming e-mail. Implementation of these I&Ws would additionally need to
be followed up with enhanced phishing training for your users to understand what these warning mean, and how it does
not positively confirm a malicious e-mail or phish but should alert them to treat the e-mail with caution.
iDefense suggests organizations implement network segmentation, segregation and isolation for research/high-value
systems in enclave networks. Threat groups like MUDCARP specifically target intellectual property and research for
espionage or theft in these systems. Controlling information boundaries and security perimeters of these highvalue/research systems is critical to making them defensible as part of best practices for secure network architecture. It
is advisable to request researchers define the operational network requirements (if any) needed for their research &
development systems. Once defined, then strictly enforce network access to only permitted and approved destinations
to mitigate exposure to threat actor infrastructure, such as MUDCARP standing up brand new domains and IPs as C2s
that are not necessary for researchers to connect to perform their work.
iDefense suggests organizations implement Web-proxy interception, categorization, and filtering of Internet-accessible
websites. Threat actors like MUDCARP often establish new domains or sites without a visible or functional website that
any visitor would find convincing or useful. Web proxies can evaluate these new domains and sites to determine
functionality, popularity, newness, and reputation, which are criteria that can be used to block these sites – preventing
additional malicious actions or content from being delivered to the targeted user. iDefense suggests reviewing your
Web-proxy configuration settings to determine the effects of blocking “uncategorized,” “unpopular,” and “suspicious-”
like categories available from your proxy.
iDefense suggests that organizations identify all the user-agents installed within their environment and enforce softwarebaselines to make it easier for security to identify anomalous or rogue user-agents performing connections to external
sites through network interception and monitoring. Threat actors like MUDCARP will sometimes utilize unique UserAgent strings to establish connections, for example: ` Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64;
Trident/5.0; BOIE9;ENUSMSE` - which can be more easily identified during security monitoring if there is a list of known
standardized User-Agents to compare against.
iDefense suggests organizations consider migrating to Windows 10 or newer OS. Threat Actors like MUDCARP can
utilize techniques like Reflective DLL Loading to write a DLL into memory and load a shell, like Meterpreter – which
gives them backdoor access to the victim. However, Windows 10 OS now has Windows Defender Advanced Threat
Protection (ATP), Exploit Guard, and Import Address Table Access Filtering (IAF) which can detect these techniques
and upcoming security features that could even potentially mitigate it by requiring files to exist on disk before they can
be executed in combination with application-whitelisting.
iDefense suggests that organizations implement PowerShell security features. Threat actors such as MUDCARP are
known to utilize PowerShell to issue malicious commands and operate on compromised systems. To mitigate this tactic,
enable PowerShell script block logging through the Windows Components -> Windows PowerShell -> "Turn on
PowerShell Script Block Logging" policy value option. Furthermore, disable the PowerShell 2.0 version with the
command “Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName MicrosoftWindowsPowerShellV2Root.” In addition,
if your staff do not need or use PowerShell for business operations, consider setting the execution policy to be very
restrictive all users and monitor for any suspicious use of PowerShell on systems.
iDefense suggests organizations review and test OLE/COM blocking controls in their environment to determine if they
can still complete necessary business operations without Object Linking and Embedding (OLE)-embedded functionality.
Threat actors like MUDCARP are likely to continue to utilize OLE as a method to insert malicious content inside various
phishing documents. OLE/COM component activation can be blocked through the following registry key change:
“\Microsoft\Office\ClickToRun\REGISTRY\MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\COM
Compatibility\{CLSID} DWORD ActivationFilterOverride = 1”.

iDefense suggests as a precaution that your organization configure Microsoft Office applications with secure technical
implementations that may mitigate current and future MUDCARP attack techniques that target this suite of software,
such as the following:
•

•

•

•

•

•
•

•

•
•

Threat actors may attempt to force Office applications to spawn an instance of Internet Explorer that loads
dangerous content, such as ActiveX. To mitigate this, enable “Restrict ActiveX Installs” in Internet Explorer,
enable "Scripted Window Security Restrictions" and enable Binding of these security policies to Microsoft office
applications through the Security Settings -> IE Security “Bind to Object” so they cannot be bypassed.
Threat actors may embed navigation to URLs or other hyperlinks within lure document to compromise the user.
To mitigate this technique, enable the block of URL navigation from Office files through the Security Settings ->
IE Security "Navigate URL" option. Furthermore, consider training users to manually navigate in URLs needed
for business and to be wary of such links provided by external sources.
Threat actors may utilize exploits in certain Office documents and templates. Enable Protected View to mitigate
exploits for files originating from the internet, files located in potentially unsafe locations and Outlook
attachments, through the Security -> Trust Center -> Protected View options. Furthermore, enable Data
Execution Prevention (DEP) through the System -> Advanced system settings -> Settings -> Data Execution
Prevention -> "Turn on DEP for all programs and services except those I select" option. In addition, enable
Control Flow Guard (CFG) through the Windows Defender Security Center -> App & browser control -> Exploit
protection settings -> System settings -> "Control flow guard (CFG)" option.
Threat actors may embed macros or VBA scripts in Office files to execute malicious actions. Block macros from
running in Office files from the Internet through the Security -> Trust Center options. Furthermore, disable
trusted access to the VBA object model through the Security -> Trust Center "Trust access to Visual Basic
Project", disable “VBScript to run in Internet Explorer” and train users to be wary of all macros from external
sources.
Threat actors may establish second-stage payload and malware downloads through the initial e-mail
attachment and deceive users or bypass download warning prompts. To mitigate this, disable any file
downloads requested by Office applications through the Security Settings -> IE Security "Restrict File
Download" option.
Threats actors may link external content inside Office files which can cause changes in the document without
the user’s knowledge. To mitigate this, disable automatic updating of links through the Word Options ->
Advanced "Update automatic links at Open".
Threat actors may use password-protection or other rights-management features in Office files to encrypt
malicious macros or scripts within the file to bypass Anti-Virus scanning. To mitigate this, enable scanning of
encrypted macros through the Security -> Trust Center "Scan encrypted macros in Word Open XML
documents" option.
Threat actors may attempt to load local Web pages through Office files to bypass security controls. To mitigate
this, disable local machine zone elevation through the Security Settings -> IE Security "Protection From Zone
Elevation" option. Furthermore, block invoked hyperlink instances of popups from Office documents through the
Security Settings -> IE Security "Block popups" option.
Threat actors may attempt to load malicious files through external web content. To mitigate this, enable the
Smart Screen Filter through the Windows Components -> Internet Explorer -> Internet Control Panel -> Security
Page -> Restricted Sites Zone -> ”Turn on SmartScreen Filter scan” option.
Threat actors may also target wordpad.exe rather than winword.exe with RTF files - so exploit protection
mitigations should be enabled to mitigate against this. Enable Control Flow Guard (CFG) through the Windows
Defender Security Center -> App & browser control -> Exploit protection settings -> System settings -> "Control
flow guard (CFG)" option for wordpad.exe.

iDefense suggests maintaining and configuring any detonation chambers, or anti-malware sandboxes to match the
current running configuration and software versions of production systems in your environment. This can be important
for running and testing incoming files to your organizations for the presence of malicious code that may only specifically
target certain product versions with new vulnerabilities that may not correctly exploit sandboxes that diverge from
production.

iDefense suggests that organizations actively hunt for attachments sent to your organization with the presence of OLEembedded objects, Equation Editor and linked objects. An example of one of these hunting rules is provided below for
reference:

Object #2 contains a shellcode that exploits 2017-11882 (EQNEDIT).
If the targeted user opens the weaponized document inside a vulnerable version of Microsoft Office and additionally clicks
the table shown in Exhibit 1, the weaponized document tries writing “8.t” into following folder and the shellcode within
object #2 then tries performing a custom rotating XOR cypher to decode the 8.t file. Exhibit 2 through 5 show screenshots
of the XOR cypher routine, pseudo representation of XOR cypher routine, and the decoded “8.t” before and after
decryption:

The decoded malware stores its configuration setting using aPlib compression algorithm. Exhibit 6 shows the pseudo
code of WinMain subroutine

Exhibit 6: Analyst-derived Screenshot of Pseudo Code Representation of WinMain Routine of Decoded 8.t

The malware, also known as BADFLICK, communicates with following hard-coded IP address:
•

103.243.175[.]181

This IP has been associated with the eujinonline.sytes[.]net and update.wsmcoff[.]com domains which have almost
certainly been used as C2s for MUDCARP to target maritime organizations. The configuration displayed in Exhibit 6
indicates that the malware will delay communication to 103.243.175[.]181 by 5 minutes over port 80. The malware
captures the computer name, IP address, memory space, and cpu details and reports it back to the C2 as compressed
data using the aPLib compression library. After establishing a connection to the C2, the BADFLICK malware will accept
commands to return a reverse shell or perform remote operations such as searching for files on the infected host and
downloading/uploading files to or from the C2. iDefense judges that based on the lack of persistence methods of
BADFLICK, it is likely used to download a third-stage backdoors or implants that will maintain persistence on the victim
system for advanced operations and targeting.
--iDefense suggests organizations perform historical searches, monitoring and blocking of the following indicators:

4. CONCLUSION
At this time, iDefense is still analyzing the data sets collected by proprietary sensors and intelligence operations in order
to bolster the findings included in this report. However, there have been no identified reasons to believe that this data
set is incorrect.
As indicated by the 2018 Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) Worldwide Threat Assessment report,
China will continue to target cleared defense contractors, IT and communications firms using its robust cyber espionage
capabilities.8 Moreover, based upon China’s integrated and long-term military modernization plans, it could be assumed
that Chinese-sponsored collection against maritime technologies that afford advantages to Western and allied naval
forces will continue into the foreseeable future.
iDefense believes that DoD supply chain assets, with an emphasis on medium and small contractors, academic
institutions and think tanks will continue to be prime targets for adversaries such as MUDCARP. Until requirements,
such as those specified in NIST SP 800-171 and "Deliver Uncompromised: A Strategy for Supply Chain Security and
Resilience in Response to the Changing Character of War", are implemented by members of the DoD supply chain and
routinely audited and enforced by the United States government, foreign threat actors will continue to actively exploit
these shortcomings.
