Chinese Ministry of State Security-Affiliated
Cyber Threat Actor Activity
SUMMARY
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has consistently observed Chinese
Ministry of State Security (MSS)-affiliated cyber threat actors using publicly available information
sources and common, well-known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to target U.S.
Government agencies. CISA has observed these—and other threat actors with varying degrees of
skill—routinely using open-source information to plan and execute cyber operations. CISA leveraged
the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK®) and Pre-ATT&CK
frameworks to characterize the TTPs used by Chinese MSS-affiliated actors. This product was written
by CISA with contributions by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

KEY TAKEAWAYS
•
•
•
•

•

Chinese MSS-affiliated cyber threat actors use open-source information to plan and conduct
cyber operations.
Chinese MSS-affiliated cyber threat actors use readily available exploits and exploit toolkits to
quickly engage target networks.
Maintaining a rigorous patching cycle continues to be the best defense against the most
frequently used attacks.
If critical vulnerabilities remain unpatched, cyber threat actors can carry out attacks without the
need to develop custom malware and exploits or use previously unknown vulnerabilities to
target a network.
This Advisory identifies some of the more common—yet most effective—TTPs employed by
cyber threat actors, including Chinese MSS-affiliated cyber threat actors.

TECHNICAL DETAILS
Through the operation of the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS) and by fulfilling its
mission as the national risk advisor, CISA has observed Chinese MSS-affiliated cyber threat actors
operating from the People’s Republic of China using commercially available information sources and
open-source exploitation tools to target U.S. Government agency networks.
According to a recent U.S. Department of Justice indictment, MSS-affiliated actors have targeted
various industries across the United States and other countries—including high-tech manufacturing;
medical device, civil, and industrial engineering; business, educational, and gaming software; solar
energy; pharmaceuticals; and defense—in a campaign that lasted over ten years.1 These hackers
acted for both their own personal gain and the benefit of the Chinese MSS.2
According to the indictment,
To conceal the theft of information from victim networks and otherwise evade detection,
the defendants typically packaged victim data in encrypted Roshal Archive Compressed
files (RAR files), changed RAR file and victim documents’ names and extensions (e.g.,
from “.rar” to “.jpg”) and system timestamps, and concealed programs and documents at
innocuous-seeming locations on victim networks and in victim networks’ “recycle bins.”
The defendants frequently returned to re-victimize companies, government entities, and
organizations from which they had previously stolen data, in some cases years after the
initial successful data theft. In several instances, however, the defendants were
unsuccessful in this regard, due to the efforts of the FBI and network defenders.
The continued use of open-source tools by Chinese MSS-affiliated cyber threat actors highlights that
adversaries can use relatively low-complexity capabilities to identify and exploit target networks. In
most cases, cyber operations are successful because misconfigurations and immature patch
management programs allow actors to plan and execute attacks using existing vulnerabilities and
known exploits. Widespread implementation of robust configuration and patch management programs
would greatly increase network security. It would also reduce the speed and frequency of
opportunistic attacks by forcing threat actors to dedicate time and funding to research unknown
vulnerabilities and develop custom exploitation tools.

MITRE PRE-ATT&CK® Framework for Analysis
In the last 12 months, CISA analysts have routinely observed Chinese MSS-affiliated actors using the
following PRE-ATT&CK® Framework TTPs.

Target Selection and Technical Information Gathering
Target Selection [TA0014] is a critical part of cyber operations. While cyber threat actors’ motivations
and intents are often unknown, they often make their selections based on the target network’s
security posture. Threat actors can use information sources such as Shodan, the Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) database, and the National Vulnerabilities Database (NVD).3,4,5
•

•

Shodan is an internet search engine that can be used to identify vulnerable devices connected
to the internet. Shodan queries can also be customized to discover specific vulnerabilities on
devices, which enables sophisticated cyber threat actors to use relatively unsophisticated
techniques to execute opportunistic attacks on susceptible targets.
The CVE database and the NVD contain detailed information about vulnerabilities in
applications, appliances, and operating systems that can be exploited by cyber threat actors if
they remain unpatched. These sources also provide risk assessments if any of the recorded
vulnerabilities are successfully exploited.

These information sources have legitimate uses for network defense. CISA analysts are able to
identify Federal Government systems that may be susceptible to exploitation attempts by using
Shodan, the CVE database, and the NVD to enrich NCPS information. Unlike threat actors, CISA
takes the necessary actions to notify network owners of their exposure in order to prevent an
impending intrusion or quickly identify intrusions as they occur.
While using these data sources, CISA analysts have observed a correlation between the public
release of a vulnerability and targeted scanning of systems identified as being vulnerable. This
correlation suggests that cyber threat actors also rely on Shodan, the CVE database, the NVD, and
other open-source information to identify targets of opportunity and plan cyber operations. Together,
these data sources provide users with the understanding of a specific vulnerability, as well as a list of
systems that may be vulnerable to attempted exploits. These information sources therefore contain
invaluable information that can lead cyber threat actors to implement highly effective attacks.
CISA has observed Chinese MSS-affiliated actors using the techniques in table 1 to gather technical
information to enable cyber operations against Federal Government networks (Technical Information
Gathering [TA0015]).

Government webpages. This activity appeared to enable
information gathering activities.
CISA analysts reviewed the network activity of known
threat actor IP addresses and found evidence of
reconnaissance activity involving virtual security devices.

Technical Weakness Identification
CISA analysts consistently observe targeting, scanning, and probing of significant vulnerabilities
within days of their emergence and disclosure. This targeting, scanning, and probing frequently leads
to compromises at the hands of sophisticated cyber threat actors. In some cases, cyber threat actors
have used the same vulnerabilities to compromise multiple organizations across many sectors.
Organizations do not appear to be mitigating known vulnerabilities as quickly as cyber threat actors
are exploiting them. CISA recently released an alert that highlighted the top 10 vulnerabilities routinely
exploited by sophisticated foreign cyber threat actors from 2016 to 2019.6
Additionally, table 2 provides a list of notable compromises by Chinese MSS-affiliated actors within
the past 12 months.

CISA has conducted multiple incident response engagements at Federal
Government and commercial entities where the threat actors exploited
CVE-2019-11510—an arbitrary file reading vulnerability affecting Pulse
Secure VPN appliances—to gain access to victim networks. Although
Pulse Secure released patches for CVE-2019-11510 in April 2019, CISA
observed incidents where compromised Active Directory credentials
were used months after the victim organization patched their VPN
appliance.9

CVE-2020-0688:
Microsoft Exchange

MITRE ATT&CK Framework for Analysis
CISA has observed sophisticated cyber threat actors, including Chinese MSS-affiliated actors, using
commercial and open-source tools to conduct their operations. For example, threat actors often
leverage internet software repositories such as GitHub and Exploit-DB.10,11 Both repositories are
commonly used for legitimate development and penetration testing and developing open-source
code, but cyber threat actors can also use them to find code to enable nefarious actions.
During incident response activities, CISA frequently observed Chinese government-affiliated actors
using the open-source tools outlined in table 5.

Observations
CISA has observed the threat actors using Cobalt Strike to target commercial and
Federal Government networks. Cobalt Strike is a commercial penetration testing
tool used to conduct red team operations. It contains a number of tools that
complement the cyber threat actor’s exploitation efforts, such as a keystroke
logger, file injection capability, and network services scanners. CISA observed
connections from a Federal Government agency to multiple IP addresses possibly
hosting Cobalt Strike team servers.
CISA has observed the actors successfully deploying China Chopper against
organizations’ networks. This open-source tool can be downloaded from internet
software repositories such GitHub and Exploit-DB. China Chopper is a web shell
hosted on a web server. It is mainly used for web application attacks, and it is
configured in a client/server relationship. China Chopper contains security scanners
and can be used to upload files and brute-force passwords.

CISA has observed the actors using Mimikatz during their operations. This opensource tool is used to capture account credentials and perform privilege escalation
with pass-the-hash attacks that allow an attacker to pass captured password
hashes and authenticate to network devices.12

Mimikatz

The following sections list the ATT&CK Framework TTPs routinely employed by Chinese governmentaffiliated actors to conduct cyber operations as observed by CISA analysts.

Initial Access
In the last 12 months, CISA has observed Chinese MSS-affiliated actors use spearphishing emails
with embedded links to actor-owned infrastructure and, in some cases, compromise or poison
legitimate sites to enable cyber operations.
CISA has observed the threat actors using the Initial Access [TA0001] techniques identified in table 6.

and concluded that the threat actors sent a malicious email
weaponized with links.

T1190

CISA has observed the actors leveraging CVE-2019-19781 to
compromise Citrix Application Delivery Controllers.

Exploit Public-Facing
Application

Cyber threat actors can continue to successfully launch these types of low-complexity attacks—as
long as misconfigurations in operational environments and immature patch management programs
remain in place—by taking advantage of common vulnerabilities and using readily available exploits
and information.

Execution
CISA analysts continue to observe beaconing activity indicative of compromise or ongoing access to
Federal Government networks. This beaconing is a result of cyber threat actors successfully
completing cyber operations that are often designed around emergent vulnerabilities and reliant on
existing exploitation tools, as mentioned in this document.

Software
Deployment
Tools

CISA observed activity from a Federal Government IP address
beaconing out to the threat actors’ C2 server, which is usually an
indication of compromise.

Credential Access
Cyber threat actors also continue to identify large repositories of credentials that are available on the
internet to enable brute-force attacks. While this sort of activity is not a direct result of the exploitation
of emergent vulnerabilities, it demonstrates that cyber threat actors can effectively use available
open-source information to accomplish their goals. Further, a threat actor does not require a high
degree of competence or sophistication to successfully carry out this kind of opportunistic attack.
CISA has observed Chinese MSS-affiliated actors using the Credential Access [TA0006] techniques
highlighted in table 8.

the tool.

T1110.004 Brute Force: Credential
Stuffing

CISA observed what was likely a brute-force attack of
a Remote Desktop Protocol on a public-facing server.

Discovery
As with any cyber operation, cyber threat actors must be able to confirm that their target is online and
vulnerable—there are a multitude of open-source scanning and reconnaissance tools available to
them to use for this purpose. CISA consistently observes scanning activity across federal agencies
that is indicative of discovery techniques. CISA has observed Chinese MSS-affiliated actors scanning
Federal Government traffic using the discovery technique highlighted in table 9 (Discovery [TA0007]).

Command and Control
CISA analysts often observe cyber threat actors using external proxy tools or hop points to enable
their cyber operations while remaining anonymous. These proxy tools may be commercially available
infrastructure as a service (IaaS) or software as a service (SaaS) in the form of a web browser
promising anonymity on the internet. For example, “The Onion Router” (Tor) is often used by cyber
threat actors for anonymity and C2. Actor’s carefully choose proxy tools depending on their intended
use. These techniques are relatively low in complexity and enabled by commercially available tools,
yet they are highly effective and often reliant upon existing vulnerabilities and readily available
exploits.

MITIGATIONS
CISA asserts with high confidence that sophisticated cyber threat actors will continue to use opensource resources and tools to target networks with a low security posture. When sophisticated cyber
threat actors conduct operations against soft targets, it can negatively impact critical infrastructure,
federal, and state, local, tribal, territorial government networks, possibly resulting in loss of critical
data or personally identifiable information.
CISA and the FBI recommend that organizations place an increased priority on patching the
vulnerabilities routinely exploited by MSS-affiliated cyber actors. See table 12 for patch information on
the CVEs mentioned in this report. For more information on vulnerabilities routinely exploited by
sophisticated cyber actors, see CISA Alert: Top 10 Routinely Exploited Vulnerabilities.
