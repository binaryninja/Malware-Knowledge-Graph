By GReAT

The Lazarus group is currently one of the most active and proliﬁc APT actors. In 2018, Kaspersky published a report on one of their
campaigns, named Operation AppleJeus. Notably, this operation marked the ﬁrst time Lazarus had targeted macOS users, with the
group inventing a fake company in order to deliver their manipulated application and exploit the high level of trust among potential
victims. As a result of our ongoing efforts, we identiﬁed signiﬁcant changes to the group’s attack methodology. To attack macOS
users, the Lazarus group has developed homemade macOS malware, and added an authentication mechanism to deliver the next
stage payload very carefully, as well as loading the next-stage payload without touching the disk. In addition, to attack Windows
users, they have elaborated a multi-stage infection procedure, and signiﬁcantly changed the ﬁnal payload. We assess that the
Lazarus group has been more careful in its attacks following the release of Operation AppleJeus and they have employed a number
of methods to avoid being detected.
For more information, please contact: intelreports@kaspersky.com

Life after Operation AppleJeus
After releasing Operation AppleJeus, the Lazarus group continued to use a similar modus operandi in order to compromise
cryptocurrency businesses. We found more macOS malware similar to that used in the original Operation AppleJeus case. This
macOS malware used public source code in order to build crafted macOS installers. The malware authors used QtBitcoinTrader
developed by Centrabit.

Operation AppleJeus Sequel | Securelist

These three macOS installers use a similar post installer script in order to implant a mach-o payload, as well as using the same
command-line argument when executing the fetched second-stage payload. However, they have started changing their macOS
malware. We recognized a different type of macOS malware, MarkMakingBot.dmg (be37637d8f6c1fbe7f3ffc702afdfe1d), created on
2019-03-12. It doesn’t have an encryption/decryption routine for network communication. We speculate that this is an intermediate
stage in signiﬁcant changes to their macOS malware.

Change of Windows malware
During our ongoing tracking of this campaign, we found that one victim was compromised by Windows AppleJeus malware in March
2019. Unfortunately, we couldn’t identify the initial installer, but we established that the infection started from a malicious ﬁle named
WFCUpdater.exe. At that time, the actor used a fake website: wfcwallet[.]com

Fig. 1 Binary infection procedure used in WFCWallet case

The actor used a multi-stage infection like before, but the method was different. The infection started from .NET malware, disguised
as a WFC wallet updater (a9e960948fdac81579d3b752e49aceda). Upon execution, this .NET executable checks whether the
command line argument is “/Embedding” or not. This malware is responsible for decrypting the WFC.cfg ﬁle in the same folder with a
hardcoded 20-byte XOR key (82 d7 ae 9b 36 7d fc ee 41 65 8f fa 74 cd 2c 62 b7 59 f5 62). This mimics the wallet updater connected
to the C2 addresses:
wfcwallet.com (resolved ip: 108.174.195.134)
www.chainfun365.com (resolved ip: 23.254.217.53)
After that, it carries out the malware operator’s commands in order to install the next stage permanent payload. The actor delivered
two more ﬁles into the victim’s system folder: rasext.dll and msctfp.dat. They used the RasMan (Remote Access Connection
Manager) Windows service to register the next payload with a persistence mechanism. After fundamental reconnaissance, the
malware operator implanted the delivered payload by manually using the following commands:
cmd.exe /c dir rasext.dll
cmd.exe /c dir msctfp.dat
cmd.exe /c tasklist /svc | ﬁndstr RasMan
cmd.exe /c reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\RasMan\ThirdParty /v DllName /d
rasext.dll /f
In order to establish remote tunneling, the actor delivered more tools, executing with command-line parameters. Unfortunately, we
have had no chance to obtain this ﬁle, but we speculate that Device.exe is responsible for opening port 6378, and the
CenterUpdater.exe tool was used for creating tunneling to a remote host. Note that the 104.168.167.16 server is used as a C2 server.
The fake website hosting server for the UnionCryptoTrader case will be described next.

Change of macOS malware
JMTTrading case
While tracking this campaign, we identiﬁed more heavily deformed macOS malware. At the time, the attacker called their fake website
and application JMTTrading. Other researchers and security vendors found it too, and published IoCs with abundant technical details.
Malware Hunter Team tweeted about this malicious application, Vitali Kremez published a blog about the Windows version of the
malware, and Object-See published details about the macOS malware. We believe these reports are sufﬁcient to understand the
technical side. Here, we would like to highlight what’s different about this attack.
The actor used GitHub in order to host their malicious applications.
The malware author used Object-C instead of QT framework in their macOS malware.
The malware implemented a simple backdoor function in macOS executable.
The malware encrypted/decrypted with a 16-byte XOR key (X,%`PMk–Jj8s+6=) similar to the previous case.
The Windows version of the malware used ADVobfuscator, a compiled time obfuscator, in order to hide its code.
The post-install script of macOS malware differed signiﬁcantly from the previous version.
UnionCryptoTrader case
We also identiﬁed another macOS targeted attack that took place very recently. The malicious application name in this case is
UnionCryptoTrader. After compiling a threat intelligence report for our customers, one security researcher (@dineshdina04)
discovered an identical case, and Objective-See published a very detailed blog on the macOS malware used in this attack. The
Objective-See blog goes into sufﬁcient detail to explain the malware’s functionality, so we will just summarize the attack:
The post-install script is identical to that used in the JMTTrading case.
The malware author used SWIFT to develop this macOS malware.
The malware author changed the method for collecting information from the infected system.
The malware starts to conduct authentication using auth_signature and auth_timestamp parameters in order to deliver the
second-stage payload more carefully. The malware acquires the current system time and combines it with the
“12GWAPCT1F0I1S14” hardcoded string, and produces an MD5 hash of the combined string. This hash is used as the value of
the auth_signature parameter and the current time is used as the value of the auth_timestamp parameter. The malware
operator can reproduce the auth_signature value based on the auth_timestamp at the C2 server side.
The malware loads the next stage payload without touching the disk.

Windows version of UnionCryptoTrader
We also found a Windows version of the UnionCryptoTrader (0f03ec3487578cef2398b5b732631fec). It was executed from the
Telegram messenger download folder:
C:\Users\[user name]\Downloads\Telegram Desktop\UnionCryptoTraderSetup.exe
We also found the actor’s Telegram group on their fake website. Based on these, we assess with high conﬁdence that the actor
delivered the manipulated installer using the Telegram messenger. Unfortunately, we can’t get all the related ﬁles as some payloads
were only executed in memory. However, we can reassemble the whole infection procedure based on our telemetry. The overall
infection procedure was very similar to the WFCWallet case, but with an added injection procedure, and they only used the ﬁnal
backdoor payload instead of using a tunneling tool.

The Windows version of UnionCryptoTrader updater (629b9de3e4b84b4a0aa605a3e9471b31) has similar functionality to the macOS
version. According to the build path (Z:\Loader\x64\Release\WinloaderExe.pdb), the malware author called this malware a loader.
Upon launch, the malware retrieves the victim’s basic system information, sending it in the following HTTP POST format, as is the
case with the macOS malware.

If the response code from the C2 server is 200, the malware decrypts the payload and loads it in memory. Finally, the malware sends
the act=done value and return code. The next stage payload (e1953fa319cc11c2f003ad0542bca822), downloaded from this loader, is
similar to the .NET downloader in the WFCWallet case. This malware is responsible for decrypting the Adobe.icx ﬁle in the same
folder. It injects the next payload into the Internet Explorer process, and the tainted iexplore.exe process carries out the attacker’s
commands. The ﬁnal payload (dd03c6eb62c9bf9adaf831f1d7adcbab) is implanted manually as in the WFCWallet case. This ﬁnal
payload was designed to run only on certain systems. It seems that the malware authors produced and delivered malware that only
works on speciﬁc systems based on previously collected information. The malware checks the infected system’s information and
compares it to a given value. It seems the actor wants to execute the ﬁnal payload very carefully, and wants to evade detection by
behavior-based detection solutions.

Fig. 4 Malware execution ﬂow

This Windows malware loads the encrypted msctfp.dat ﬁle in a system folder, and loads each conﬁguration value. Then it executes an
additional command based on the contents of this ﬁle. When the malware communicates with the C2 server, it uses a POST request
with several predeﬁned headers.

If the response code from the C2 server is 200, the malware sends the next POST request with encrypted data and a random value.
The malware operator probably used the random value to identify each victim and verify the POST request.
imp: Random generated value
dsh: XORed value of imp
hb_tp: XORed value(key: 0x67BF32) of imp
hb_dl: Encrypted data to send to C2 server
ct: hardcoded value(1)
Finally, the malware downloads the next stage payload, decrypting it and possibly executing it with the Print parameter. We speculate
that the DLL type payload will be downloaded and call its Print export function for further infection. We can’t get hold of the ﬁnal
payload that’s executed in memory, but we believe its backdoor-type malware is ultimately used to control the infected victim.

Infrastructures
We found several fake websites that were still online when we were investigating their infrastructure. They created fake
cryptocurrency-themed websites, but they were far from perfect and most of the links didn’t work.

Fig. 6 Website of unioncrypto.vip

We found an identical Cyptian web template on the internet. We speculate that the actor used free web templates like this to build
their fake websites. Moreover, there is a Telegram address(@cyptian) on the Cyptian website. As we mentioned previously, the actor
delivered a manipulated application via Telegram messenger. This Telegram address was still alive when we investigated, but there
were no more activities at that time. According to the chat log, the group was created on December 17, 2018 and some accounts had
already been deleted.

Conclusion
We were able to identify several victims in this Operation AppleJeus sequel. Victims were recorded in the UK, Poland, Russia and
China. Moreover, we were able to conﬁrm that several of the victims are linked to cryptocurrency business entities.

Fig. 8 Infection map

The actor altered their macOS and Windows malware considerably, adding an authentication mechanism in the macOS downloader
and changing the macOS development framework. The binary infection procedure in the Windows system differed from the previous
case. They also changed the ﬁnal Windows payload signiﬁcantly from the well-known Fallchill malware used in the previous attack.
We believe the Lazarus group’s continuous attacks for ﬁnancial gain are unlikely to stop anytime soon.

Fig. 9 Timeline of Operation AppleJeus

Since the initial appearance of Operation AppleJeus, we can see that over time the authors have changed their modus operandi
considerably. We assume this kind of attack on cryptocurrency businesses will continue and become more sophisticated.
