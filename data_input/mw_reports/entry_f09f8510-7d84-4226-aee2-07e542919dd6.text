Malware (Banking Trojans / Crimeware) Detection and Takedown
Analysis and unpacking of malware in the wild to detect and takedown crimeware developed
to specifically target your organisation and your customers.
Through a combined process of automated and human analysis, FraudWatch focusses on
identifying all components of malware, from the drop sites and command and control
servers. We provide a fully managed service, detecting, assessing, and analysing potential
threats through to the take down of malware components by our Human Analysts in our 24 X
7 Security Operations Centre (SOC).
Banking Trojan Malware silently infects end users on both mobile and desktop devices
stealing account credentials unnoticed or silently hacking secure sessions.

Proactive malware detection
At its core malware is code or software that’s injected into a web-system in order to cause
damage. Intentions and capabilities range from taking control of computer systems and
corrupting software to stealing information. Malware comes in many different forms – from
viruses and spyware to ransomware and trojans – all targeting your organisation and your
customers. With so many things to look out for, malware can be easy to miss. By teaming up
with FraudWatch you will gain a team of dedicated malware analysts that source malware
circulating in the wild through network relationships and data feeds. This malware is then
unpacked and analysed to determine if it is targeting your organisation. If it is – further
analysis is then performed to identify the command-and-control servers (C&C) and
Credential drop sites. All the while giving you the confidence that your website is protected.

Malware protection and prevention
FraudWatch uses expert human analysts in our 24×7 Security Operation Centre (SOC) to
spearhead the malware component takedown process. We do much more than simply send
an automated single email to an abuse mailbox. Our team analyses each hosted component
to determine all possible parties involved and work tirelessly to contact them. As a result of
our extensive experience in the industry, in many cases, we have a direct reporting process
for immediate takedown of malicious software.
Once all back-end infrastructure of the malware is taken down, it is rendered inoperable,
regardless of the number of devices infected. The malware simply cannot communicate and
provide stolen data or credentials back to the criminals. Working in conjunction with our
exceptional DMARC and Phishing solutions will ensure overall protection of your company’s
assets.
Malware solutions are our business – which gives you the confidence to focus on your own.
