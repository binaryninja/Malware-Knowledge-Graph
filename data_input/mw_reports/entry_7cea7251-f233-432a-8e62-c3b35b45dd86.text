Executive Summary
AT&T Alien Labsâ„¢ has identified a new tool from the TeamTNT adversary group, which has
been previously observed targeting exposed Docker infrastructure for cryptocurrency mining
purposes and credential theft. The group is using a new detection evasion tool, copied from
open source repositories.
The purpose of this blog is to share new technical intelligence and provide detection and
analysis options for defenders.

Background
AT&T Alien Labs previously reported on TeamTNT cryptomining malware using a new
memory loader based on Ezuri and written in GOlang. Since then, TeamTNT has added
another tool to their list of capabilities.

Analysis
The objective of the new tool is to hide the malicious process from process information
programs such as `ps` and `lsof`, effectively acting as a defense evasion technique.
The tool, named libprocesshider, is an open source tool from 2014 located on Github,
described as "hide a process under Linux using the ld preloader.'' Preloading allows the
system to load a custom shared library before other system libraries are loaded. If the
custom shared library exports a function with the same signature of one located in the
system libraries, the custom version will override it.
The tool implements the function readdir() which is being used by processes such as `ps` to
read the /proc directory to find running processes and to modify the return value in case
there is a match between the processes found and the process needed to hide.
The new tool arrives within a base64 encoded script hidden in the TeamTNT cryptominer
binary or ircbot (figure 1):

Upon binary execution, the bash script will run through a multitude of tasks. Specifically, the
script will:
Modify the network DNS configuration.
Set persistence through systemd.
Drop and activate the new tool as service.
Download the latest IRC bot configuration.
Clear evidence of activities to complicate potential defender actions.
After decoding, we can observe the bash script functionality and how some malicious activity
occurs before the shared library is created (figure 2):

The new tool is first dropped as a hidden tar file on disk, the script decompresses it, writes it
to '/usr/local/lib/systemhealt.so', and then adds it preload via '/etc/ld.so.preload'. This will be
used by the system to preload the file before other system libraries, allowing the attacker to
override some common functions (figure 3/4).

The main purpose of the tool is to hide the TeamTNT bot from process viewer tools, which
use the file '/usr/bin/sbin' as you can see in Figure 3 and 4 (SETUP_IRCBOT function).
As final step, the malware will remove traces by deleting bash history:

Conclusion
Through the use of libprocesshider, TeamTNT once again expands their capabilities based
on the available open source tools. While the new functionality of libprocesshider is to evade
detection and other basic functions, it acts as an indicator to consider when hunting for
malicious activity on the host level. Alien Labs will continue to monitor the threat and report
on any noteworthy activity.

Appendix A. Detection Methods
The following associated detection methods are in use by Alien Labs. They can be used by
readers to tune or deploy detections in their own environments or for aiding additional
research.
