A look into BlackEnergy malware and using ThreatConnect to
aggregate and memorialize the identified intelligence.
As workers prepared to head home on December 23, 2015, an attack against Ukraine’s
energy sector left 230,000 without electricity (or heat) for six hours. The attackers
demonstrated a variety of capabilities, including spearphishing emails and variants of the
BlackEnergy 3 malware to gain a foothold into the Information Technology (IT) networks of
the electricity companies. The December 2015 incident was the first known instance where a
cyber attack disrupted electric grid operations. And BlackEnergy 3 malware was key to
enabling it.
This blog post will:
Examine how we used the ThreatConnect platform as part of the intelligence cycle
when reviewing the BlackEnergy malware.
Review the BlackEnergy malware, related incidents, and methods for gathering
indicators related to the malware.
Discuss how researchers can use ThreatConnect to sort through and pull these
indicators together.

This graphic captures how we incorporated ThreatConnect into the intelligence cycle to
aggregate and memorialize intelligence on BlackEnergy. We started off by identifying
background information on BlackEnergy and the actors behind it, which ultimately drove our
later research efforts.

Planning and Direction – BlackEnergy Background
Since it was first found in the wild in 2007, the BlackEnergy malware family has grown to
include three variants, the third of which was used in the Ukraine cyber attacks. The first
variant is a simple Trojan that runs distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks against
targeted servers. The second variant –also known as BlackEnergy 2– marked a major
change to the malware’s capabilities and an almost complete code rewrite from the first
variant. BlackEnergy 2 added support for 64 bit drivers and implemented UAC Bypass
Installers to give the malware elevated code execution privileges on Windows. The third
variant (BlackEnergy 3) was also a big change from BlackEnergy 2 with the addition of a
wider variety of plugins and anti-analysis techniques.

The Russian APT Sandworm Team, also known as Quedagh and BE2 APT, is associated
with BlackEnergy attacks targeting various organizations in Ukraine. Since at least 2009,
Sandworm Team has also previously attacked government, telecommunications, defense,
and energy organizations.

The consistent use of BlackEnergy malware against the energy and industrial sectors means
those organizations should consider BlackEnergy an intelligence requirement. Identifying
and memorializing strategic intelligence on when BlackEnergy was used, what it targeted,
what it can do, and how it has evolved can ultimately inform those organizations’ higher level
defensive efforts. The next step in the intelligence cycle is to collect intelligence on the threat
itself.

Intelligence Collection
OSINT Baseline
One method ThreatConnect uses when researching a threat, is collecting indicators from
openly available sources. These collections often include network and file indicators
including hashes, hostnames, IP addresses, and email addresses. ThreatConnect also has a
free intelligence feed collecting over 75 cybersecurity reports and blogs that automatically
captures indicators so organizations and researchers can incorporate them into their
investigative and defensive efforts.

Incidents
One good starting point was a 2014 Kaspersky report detailing BlackEnergy use that
contained five MD5 hashes associated with the BlackEnergy 3 malware. After identifying
these openly available reports and indicators, we imported them into ThreatConnect and
associated them with their respective BlackEnergy Incidents.

Malware Hunting
4/11

Another method that can be used to identify and gather indicators is hunting using YARA
rules. We used the ThreatConnect YARA hunting integration to deploy a YARA ruleset of five
BlackEnergy signatures and identified samples submitted to a public malware scanning site
that matched those YARA rules. The matching file results identified all three variants of the
malware and associated the file indicators with YARA signature groups in the Platform.

Hunting for BlackEnergy in the ThreatConnect Platform
Above is an image of the output from hunting for BlackEnergy using ThreatConnect. The
YARA hunting integration automatically imports file indicators that match deployed YARA
rules. These indicators are organized into groups based on the date of identification, the
associated rule, and sample. This integration helped us identify hundreds of files related to
this specific threat. Additionally, it helped us organize the data so that it can be enriched and
associated with other BlackEnergy intelligence in the platform.

Processing and Exploitation – Building Out Intelligence With
ThreatConnect
After we’ve collected intelligence from a variety of sources, we can leverage ThreatConnect’s
various integrations, Spaces apps, and investigation links to build out our understanding of
the identified activity. This iterative process helps organizations identify tactical intelligence
that may inform their incident response efforts in the wake of experienced activity.
For example, we can use our investigation links for a BlackEnergy 3 malware hash identified
in an RSA forum to query VxStream for the given file.

5/11

We can then use VxStream to find similar samples to the queried hash. Many public
malware scanning sites associate similar files to the sample being scanned, which
researchers can use to find associated samples related to the incident they are investigating.
These similar samples have already been scanned, making it easier for us to identify the
variant of the malware. This decreases the amount of time an analyst needs to spend
analyzing the sample.

This newly identified information that augments findings from intelligence collection efforts, is
then imported into ThreatConnect and associated with the BlackEnergy threat to further
increase visibility into the malware activity.

Analysis and Production – Using ThreatConnect to Associate
Indicators
Next we began grouping the indicators according to the three variants of BlackEnergy in
ThreatConnect, where we can easily and efficiently associate indicators and show
relationships using incidents, threats, and campaigns. Here’s how:
BlackEnergy Threat
The first thing that we did to start pulling BlackEnergy indicators together was create a
BlackEnergy malware threat. Threats in the Platform are made up of incidents and activity
groups defined by common infrastructure, common malware, and carried out by a common
adversary or team. Our BlackEnergy Threat captured the information we learned about
BlackEnergy during the prior phases of the intelligence cycle.

We also applied a few relevant tags such as the names of the malware variants, targeted
industry, and type of activity, and then associated the BlackEnergy malware threat group to
the preexisting Sandworm threat actor group. Tags provide another useful way to pivot
through information of interest in ThreatConnect.
BlackEnergy Incidents
After building the BlackEnergy threat, we began compiling incidents for each variant of the
malware. These incidents have indicators associated to them, and allow us to organize our
work as we enrich those indicators. We started with a BlackEnergy 2 Malware Samples
incident, BlackEnergy 3 Malware Samples incident, and a BlackEnergy Malware incident.
Shortly thereafter we pulled together a Ukraine BlackEnergy 3 Attacks incident so that we
could move all of the indicators of compromise from that attack into one group.
BlackEnergy Malware Incidents
We also associated two incidents that were already associated with the Sandworm threat
actor and the CVE-2014-4114 vulnerabilities, as they had similar indicators and
characteristics to the BlackEnergy 3 malware. From there, we began gathering BlackEnergy
related indicators to associate to each incident.
BlackEnergy 3 Campaign
After building the Threat and Incidents, we created a BlackEnergy 3 Campaign to organize
all of the BlackEnergy 3 related Incidents including the Ukraine BlackEnergy 3 Attacks, and
BlackEnergy 3 Samples Incidents. We chose to create a campaign for this variant because

we found several reports
with different indicators,
that we felt needed
individual Incidents.
Generally, the purpose
of creating a campaign in
ThreatConnect is to
associate together
related incidents, or
other campaigns.

Dissemination and Integration
Information and data you found in ThreatConnect can be shared out to other users and other
communities that you have access to. This includes our Common Community, which is
available to all of our wonderful users as well as the ThreatConnect Intelligence source,
reserved for our paying customers. You can also download your Incidents, Indicators, and
Threats as a PDF and copy other incidents to your research organization using the “Copy to
My Org” function to show to individuals that may not have access to ThreatConnect, so that
they can make informed decisions using ThreatConnect data. You are also able to follow
incidents from other organizations and get immediate or summarized reports on changes
made to those incidents.

Making it Actionable
Now that we have identified and pulled all of this information together in ThreatConnect and
shared with appropriate parties, what happens next? As we like to say, intelligence doesn’t
exist for its own sake: it exists to inform decisions. Using the ThreatConnect Platform, the
information gathered can be used to make informed decisions about the threat posed by
BlackEnergy, and prevent and respond effectively to incoming threats. ThreatConnect has
numerous integrations that make it easy to take action on information pulled together in the
Platform. The added functionality of ThreatConnect Playbooks further simplifies these
processes allowing users to quickly send indicators to be blocked, further analyzed by an
automated malware analysis service, or even assigned to an analyst.
Looking beyond ThreatConnect, recommendations like these from the ICS-CERT are other
ways to protect ICS (Industrial Control Systems) and energy sector systems:
Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Control system devices
should not directly face the Internet.
Locate control system networks and devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the
business network
If remote access is required, employ secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks
(VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.
Remove, disable, or rename any default system accounts wherever possible.
Apply patches in the ICS environment, when possible to mitigate known vulnerabilities
Implement policies requiring the use of strong passwords.
Monitor the creation of administrator level accounts by third-party vendors.
Limiting remote systems or unmanned stations with sensitive information or computer
systems.
