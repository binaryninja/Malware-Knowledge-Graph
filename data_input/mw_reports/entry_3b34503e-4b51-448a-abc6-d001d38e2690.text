Newly Found Malware Threatens IoT Devices

January 12, 2022

A new malware has been identified by AT&T Alien Labs that exposed millions of Internet of
Things devices. The BotenaGo backdoor vulnerability, written in Google’s Golang
programming language, uses the Internet of Things (IoT) with 19412 networking ports or
associated modules. The said malware threatens IoT devices and can simultaneously exploit
up to 30 separate vulnerabilities against its targets.
Mercenaries turned to Shodan to ensure that millions of devices were compromised by at
least part of the malware’s activities. Shodan is a search engine used for hunting internetconnected devices on the internet. Unfortunately, the number of antivirus solutions capable
of protecting against infection is far lower. The software is believed to be similar to the Mirai
botnet, which was responsible for shutting down internet connectivity for parts of the East
Coast in 2016.
When BotenaGo was found, just six of the 62 vendors that the malware-scanning VirusTotal
platform used to identify it as malware detected it as malware. A few recognized BotenaGo
as malware because it was based on Mirai – a malicious software intended to construct
1/4

botnets. Its controllers may launch widespread denial of service attacks against its targets by
doing so.
LIFARS Managed Threat Hunting and Response Service (MTH&R) was designed to
help customers uncover adversaries across your Endpoint, Network and SIEM data.
Our elite team has decades of combined experience working within their Governmental
CSIRT responding and hunting for adversaries from 100’s of attacks, including
Ransomware and APT’s.

BotenaGo’s Operational Structures
BotenaGo starts by presenting the total number of infected devices to the hacker’s payload
interface, which occurs before injecting shell script files into the host console’s operating
system. The attack surface is then assaulted by employing a function to map the victim’s
device to narrow down the scope of the assault. Each destination is defined in command
terminal strings to launch malicious malware on the target device. Following that, a request is
sent to the IoT endpoint to verify that the destination is legitimate. To send the malicious
payload, the attackers must press the enter key.
BotenaGo looks for potentially susceptible targets during the scanning process as the
malware threatens IoT devices. An examination of the code shows that the attacker is
supplied with a real-time global infection counter, which indicates the number of affected
devices on the network at any particular point in time. From this, the attackers can exploit
vulnerabilities in internet-facing devices and execute remote shell commands, which
attackers might utilize as a gateway to the broader network if the device is not adequately
protected.
Additionally, attackers can use this option to spread malicious payloads. However, at the time
of the researchers’ analysis of BotenaGo, many of these payloads were deleted from the
servers maintained by the attackers; thus, it was not feasible to analyze them.

What Vulnerabilities Can Be Compromised With BotenaGo
BotenaGo can hack millions of vulnerable systems. It can go as big as malware that
threatens IoT devices. However, according to the researchers, there is no apparent
connection with a command and control server at this time. Accordingly, there are three
possible outcomes to consider. Initially, BotenaGo may be merely a broader malware suite
module that isn’t currently utilized in assaults. Another option is tied to Mirai, which
individuals use to target particular computers when launching attacks.
Likewise, experts claim that BotenaGo is still under development and that a beta version was
mistakenly published early, which explains why it doesn’t seem to be doing anything. Even if
BotenaGo is not actively exploiting any vulnerabilities, the sheer number of flaws it can
attack implies that millions of devices are theoretically susceptible.

Methods for Keeping Your Organization Safe From a Potential IoT
Attack
You can avoid any assault and malware that threatens IoT devices by keeping software up to
date and applying security upgrades as soon as possible. That will reduce the time for
attackers to exploit newly discovered vulnerabilities in IoT software. It is also advised that IoT
devices not be exposed to the public internet and that a properly configured firewall be
installed to give off better security.

Keep Firmware And Applications Up To Date
Firmware keeps you secure by installing the most recent security fixes and reducing the
likelihood of a cyberattack occurring. You may patch any vulnerabilities or exploits as they
are discovered and make your IoT devices more secure. If at all feasible, enable the option
to check for updates automatically.

Modify The Router’s Default Configuration
The majority of individuals forget to change their routers and instead use the name provided
by the manufacturer instead. That might jeopardize the security of a personal Wi-Fi network.
Any name you like, as long as it is not affiliated with you. Because so many IoT devices are
linked to Wi-Fi, the network and Wi-Fi are the first line of defense against hackers when
securing your IoT devices. Make sure that the default privacy and security settings are
changed. Those configurations often serve the interests of manufacturers rather than you.
Avoid online shopping when connected to a public Wi-Fi network since anybody may take
your information.

Stay Away From Universal Plug and Play Devices
Even though Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) has its benefits, it may render printers, routers,
cameras, and other Internet of Things (IoT) devices susceptible to cyber assaults. The
underlying premise behind the design of UPnP is to make it simpler for network devices to
communicate with one another without the need for extra setup and to assist them in
automatically discovering one another. However, hackers will profit the most from this since
they can find all IoT devices outside your local network. As a result, it is recommended that
UPnP be turned off altogether.

Have A Complex Password And Do Not Reuse it
If you are still using the words “password” and “qwerty” as your password, you should
reconsider your strategy. Using a common and basic password for Internet of Things devices
is equivalent to opening the door to hackers. Passwords that are both strong and secure are
the greatest safeguard against hackers. Make sure to use a different, one-of-a-kind
password for each device. If hackers can guess one of your passwords, they might damage

3/4

every device you possess that relies upon that password to function correctly. Yes, it may be
challenging to remember all passwords, but it is necessary to safeguard Internet of Things
devices. You may jot them down in your journal but abstain from storing them on your
technological device.

Turn Off Any IoT Devices Connected To The Network When Not In Use
You must be conscious of every feature you require from your Internet of Things device.
Most modern products, including refrigerators and televisions, can connect to the internet.
However, that does not imply that you must link them to the internet as well. It would help if
you scrutinized the characteristics of your devices to determine which gadgets need internet
access to work properly.

Final Thoughts
The bulk of IoT manufacturers send out frequent updates, and you can also check their
websites to see if there are any new security patches or upgrades available. Because IoT
devices do not have any additional layers of protection, keeping them up to date regularly is
essential for their security. Software updates for Internet of Things devices guarantee that
the device is equipped with the most recent antimalware and antivirus defenses.
Furthermore, it assists the system in cleaning up the security weaknesses present in prior
software versions. Hackers are continually refining their strategies for invading your personal
information. It is preferable to keep software up to date and to be prepared for any external
threats.
