Lazarus Group, the North Korean hackers who hacked Sony Films a few years back, have
deployed their first Mac malware ever, according to Russian antivirus vendor Kaspersky
Lab.
In a report shared with Bleeping Computer in advance, Kaspersky researchers reveal that
Lazarus Group penetrated the IT systems of an Asia-based cryptocurrency exchange
platform.
The hack of this platform was not reported in the media as of yet, a Kaspersky
spokesperson told Bleeping Computer.
"The company was breached successfully, but we are not aware of any financial loss,"
Vitaly Kamluk, Head of GReAT APAC at Kaspersky Lab told Bleeping Computer via email
today. "We assume the threat was contained based on our notification."

Exchange hacked after employee downloads trojanized app

The hack, which Kaspersky Lab analyzed under the codename of Operation AppleJeus,
took place after one of the exchange's employees downloaded an app from a legitimatelooking website that claimed to be from a company that develops cryptocurrency trading
software.
But the app was a fake and infected with malware. On Windows, the app downloaded and
infected users with Fallchill, a remote access trojan (RAT) known to be associated with the
Lazarus Group since at least 2016, when it was deployed for the first time in live
campaigns.
But unlike previous Lazarus operations, the hackers also deployed a Mac malware strain,
something they have not done before. The malware was hidden inside the Mac version of
the same cryptocurrency trading software.
Experts say that both the Windows and Mac malware wasn't visible inside the tainted app.
Lazarus operators did not embed the malware inside the third-party app directly but merely
modified its update component to download the malware at a later date.

The mystery of the malware's certificate
Furthermore, the trojanized cryptocurrency trading software was also signed by a valid
digital certificate, allowing it to bypass security scans.
The big mystery surrounding this certificate is that it was issued by a company that
Kaspersky experts said they weren't able to prove it ever existed at the address in the
certificate's information.
"The fact that they developed malware to infect macOS users in addition to Windows users
and – most likely – even created an entirely fake software company and software product in
order to be able to deliver this malware undetected by security solutions, means that they
see potentially big profits in the whole operation, and we should definitely expect more such
cases in the near future," Kamluk says.

Kaspersky didn't name the hacked cryptocurrency exchange
Several cyber-security firms have pointed out many times this year that since the start of
2017, North Korean hackers have shown great interest in penetrating cryptocurrency
exchanges and financial institutions, from where they steal funds that they later bring back
into North Korea.
In the past year, several Asian cryptocurrency exchange platforms suffered security
incidents, primarily exchange platforms located in South Korea. Hacks have been reported
at Bithumb, Yapizon, YouBit, Coinrail, and Bithumb again.

Kaspersky did not reveal the name of the cryptocurrency exchange at the center of its
report, but told Bleeping Computer
This week, US cyber-security firm Trend Micro reported a supply-chain attack on South
Korean organizations, but did not attribute the hack to North Korea, nor did it specify that
the hack targeted a cryptocurrency exchange platform.
"We are aware of waves of attacks on supply chains in South Korea this year, but
AppleJeus is unrelated to these attacks," Kamluk told Bleeping Computer. "The victim was
not located in South Korea."
