Last week’s Intelligence blog post featured Anchor Panda, one of the many adversary
groups that CrowdStrike tracks. The adversary is the human component in an attack that
one should focus on. It is not sufficient to simply identify ‘Chinese-based hackers’; it is
important to understand the adversary group that has targeted your enterprise and what
intelligence they are there to collect. By understanding that there are multiple groups and
that they all have different tactics, techniques, and practices (TTPs), you can begin to
understand the nature of the threat, what they are looking to collect, and raise the
operational cost in order to make targeting your enterprise a costly and difficult endeavor.
Attribution is a tricky subject with regard to incident response and intrusion investigation; it
can take years of research to get the home address or the location of the Technical
Reconnaissance Bureau (TRB) affiliated with the threat actor. We have to rely on the
categorization of the adversary and understanding their TTPs, victims, objectives, and prior
art to fully evaluate the threat that adversary poses to us. Understanding the tasking orders
the adversary has received can be revealing of the adversary, who they are working for, and
their future targeting objectives. If we understand that an adversary has targeted a high-tech
company’s intellectual property, then when we encounter that adversary at a different
technology company, we have a pretty good idea what they are after. Victims of a targeted
attack by a “known” adversary benefit from understanding their intent in order to help gauge
response and hopefully make strategic decisions about what is the appropriate
countermeasure. If the adversary is known to target mergers and acquisitions intelligence of
1/2

companies involved in the Chinese market, then when that adversary shows up prior to, or
during, some M&A activity, the victim can begin to take actions to limit the effectiveness of
the compromised data, feed deceptive information or perhaps wage a formal complaint.
With this in mind, this week we are providing some indicators for a China based adversary
who we crypt as “NUMBERED PANDA.”
Numbered Panda has a long list of high-profile victims and is known by a number of names
including: DYNCALC, IXESHE, JOY RAT, APT-12, etc. Numbered Panda has targeted a
variety of victims including but not limited to media outlets, high-tech companies, and
multiple governments. Numbered Panda has targeted organizations in time-sensitive
operations such as the Fukushima Reactor Incident of 2011, likely filling intelligence gaps in
the ground cleanup/mitigation operations. Screen saver files, which are binary executables
and PDF documents, are common Numbered Panda weaponization tactics. One of the most
interesting techniques that Numbered Panda likes to use is to dynamically calculate the
Command and Control (C2) port by resolving a DNS. This effectively helps Numbered
Panda bypass egress filtering implemented to prevent unauthorized communications on
some enterprises. The malware will typically use two DNS names for communication: one is
used for command and control; the other is used with an algorithm to calculate the port to
communicate to. There are several variations of the algorithm used to calculate the C2 port,
but one of the most common is to multiply the first two octets of the IP address and add the
third octet to that value. This is typically represented as: (A * B) + C – common values might
be 200.2.43.X, which would result in communication on port 443. Numbered Panda will
frequently use blogs or WordPress in the c2 infrastructure, which helps to make the network
traffic look more legitimate. CrowdStrike has observed Numbered Panda targeting high-tech,
defense contractors, media organizations, and western governments. The following intrusion
detection rules were written and tested by the CrowdStrike Global Threat Analysis Cell
(GTAC) with performance and low false positives in mind – just remember to change the
Signature ID (SID) in the IDS rules. Disclosure of this information went through the same
IGL process as discussed in the Whois Anchor Panda blog post.
