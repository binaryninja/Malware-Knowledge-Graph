A new ransomware called CryptoHost was discovered by security researcher Jack that states that it
encrypts your data and then demands a ransom of .33 bitcoins or approximately 140 USD to get
your files back. In reality, though, your data is not encrypted, but rather copied into a password
protected RAR archive . Thankfully, the password created by this infection is easily discovered so
infected users can get their files back. This infection is currently being detected
as Ransom:MSIL/Manamecrypt.A and Ransom_CRYPTOHOST.A.
I would also like to thank Michael Gillespie and MalwareHunterTeam for their additional analysis.

The CryptoHost Ransomware

How to Decrypt or get your data back from the CryptoHost Ransomware
1/10

Normally I would not disclose a vulnerability in a ransomware as it will just lead to the developer
fixing it in a future version. Unfortunately, a certain site who will not be named, irresponsibly
revealed the method that can be used to decrypt these files, so the secret is already out.
When CryptoHost infects your computer it will move certain data files, which is detailed in the
technical analysis below, into a password protected RAR archive located in the C:\Users\
[username]\AppData\Roaming folder. This file will have a 41 character name and no extension.
An example file is 3854DE6500C05ADAA539579617EA3725BAAE2C57. The password for
this archive is the name of the archive combined with the logged in user name. So for example, if the
name of the user is Test and the RAR archive is located
at C:\Users\Test\AppData\Roaming\3854DE6500C05ADAA539579617EA3725BAAE2C57,
the password would be 3854DE6500C05ADAA539579617EA3725BAAE2C57Test.
For those who do not want to deal with figuring out the password, you can use this password
generator created by Michael Gillespie.
Before we begin, we want to first terminate the cryptohost.exe process. To do this, open the Start
Menu and type Task Manager. When the Task Manager search results appears, click on it to start
the program. Now click on the Processes tab and select the cryptohost.exe process as shown
below. Then click on the End Process button to terminate it.

End the Cryptohost.exe Process

Now to to extract the password protected RAR archive with your files in it, we first need to install
the 7-Zip application. Once it is installed, open up the C:\Users\
[username]\AppData\Roaming folder and locate the archive file using the info described
2/10

above. Now right-click on it and then select the Extract to "foldername" option as shown in the
image below.

Extraction Wizard

When the 7-Zip prompts you for the password, enter the password as described above and press
enter. You data will now be extracted into a folder name that is the same name as the RAR archive.
When done, open that folder and copy all of the folders in it to the root of your C: drive. Your data
files should now be restored.

How to remove the CryptoHost Ransomware
When CryptoHost is installed it will create a file called cryptohost.exe and store it in the C:\Users\
[username]\AppData\Roaming folder. It will alsocreate an autorun called software that executes
the ransomware on login. To remove this infection, simply end the cryptohost.exe process using
Task Manager and then delete the cryptohost.exe file. To remove the autorun you can delete this
registry key:
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\software

%AppData%\cryptohost.exe

Most security products should detect this infection at this point and remove it automatically if you
do not wish to remove CryptoHost manually.

CryptoHost Ransomware Technical Analysis
CryptoHost is currently being bundled with a uTorrent installer that when installed extracts the
cryptohost.exe to the %AppData% folder and executes it. Once executed, CryptoHost will move
all files that match certain extensions into a password protected RAR archive located in the

3/10

%AppData% folder. The name of the archive will be a SHA1 hash of the following information with
any dashes removed.
processorId + volume_serial_number_of_c: + motherboard_serial_number

The password for this archive will be in the form of the SHA1 hash+username. So if the SHA1
hash is 3854DE6500C05ADAA539579617EA3725BAAE2C57 and the user is Test the
password would be 3854DE6500C05ADAA539579617EA3725BAAE2C57Test.
The file extensions that will be moved into the password protected archive by CryptoHost are:
jpg, jpeg, png, gif, psd, ppd, tiff, flv, avi, mov, qt, wmv, rm, asf, mp4, mpg, mpeg, m4v,
3gp, 3g2, pdf, docx, pptx, doc, 7z, zip, txt, ppt, pps, wpd, wps, xlr, xls, xlsl

When the archive is finished being created, the ransomware will then perform a listing of the files in
the archive and save that list to the %AppData%\Files file. CryptoHost will now display
the ransomware screen as shown below.

CryptoHost Ransomware Screen

This screen is broken up into four subscreens that allow you to get various information about the
infection and to list the affected data files. Below are two of these screens.

How it Works Screen

Check Payment Screen

When a victim wants to decrypt their files, they need to click the Check Payment Status button,
which simply checks blockchain.info for any payments to the assigned bitcoin address. If the text
returned by the blockchain query contains the exact numbers listed in the Fee label of the
CryptoHost interface, then the ransomware will extract your files. This means that a victim has to
pay the exact amount and if more is paid, the ransomware will still not decrypt the files.
When first started CryptoHost will also try to delete the
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SafeBoot key in order to make it impossible to boot
into safe mode. Thankfully, this process does not run under the required privileges that are
necessary to remove this key.
CryptoHost will also monitor process names and Window titles for certain strings. If these strings
are detected the associated process will be terminated. In my tests this method only worked on
process names and not Window titles. The list of strings that it searches for are:

5/10

anti virus, anti-virus, antivirus, avg, bitdefender, eset, mcafee, dr.web, f-secure,
internet security, obfuscator, debugger, monitor, registry, system restore, kaspersky,
norton, ad-aware, sophos, comodo, avira, bullguard, trend micro, eset, vipre, task manager,
system configuration, registry editor, game, steam, lol, rune, facebook, instagram, youtube,
vimeo, twitter, pinterest, tumblr, meetme, netflix, amazon, ebay, shop, origin

It is interesting to note that the dev not only targets security products, but also common sites and
processes that a victim may want to visit or use for games. This is done to further aggravate the
victim into paying the ransom.
Last, but not least, this ransomware does not communicate with the malware developer in any way
and the only network communications is when it checks the blockchain.info site for payment.

Also as a note to potential victims, do NOT CLOSE the program by trying to simply "X" it out.
It will prompt you if you really wish to lose your data, and if you continue, it will try to delete
the entire RAR file. This is why it is recommended to kill it from Task Manager. If this does
occur, however, you may be able to use "undelete" software such as Recuva to recover the
archive, as it does not do a secure wipe of the file.

Lawrence Abrams - 6 years ago

I left that out as I do not think its active in the build. There is no close button.

Demonslay335 - 6 years ago

Ah, gotcha. I see it now when I double-checked the source. There is indeed a button with the
text "Remove This Software and Delete All Locked Files" that triggers the delete. It is not
visible and is disabled. Supposed to show with the other buttons I believe.

"CryptoHost is currently being bundled with a uTorrent installer..."
Yet another reason not to use μTorrent or other p2p software

Lawrence Abrams - 6 years ago

Its not a legit utorrent installer from the company themselves.

ScathEnfys - 6 years ago

I understand that. But the people who use p2p programs are also more likely to use alternative
download sites.

This RW screams "skiddie" all over... the cheesy password protected RARFile rather than a
real encryption method, the easy to find password, and the "meh" graphics.

Curie - 6 years ago

Ah, I had hoped to tell you something new, but you got lots of people helping out already. :)

These scripts are sold to script kiddies and that is why they sometimes are easily decripted or
sometimes do not make any sense. Its the authors that we should somehow go after. we will
eventually win so, don't worry.

AaroniusLeonius - 6 years ago

Script Kiddies. "Oh no! my files have been archived in a RAR file that is protected with an easy
to find password. What am I going to do?" Also, why aren't they actually encrypting files?
Archiving them isn't encrypting them but the creator clearly doesn't know that.

WinRAR actually technically uses AES encryption on the final compressed stream when you
use a password. The password is stored as a protected hash (I think it's SHA1) in the file. If the
password is securely generated, it is actually a fairly secure "encryption" since the RAR format
implements it properly (WinZIP formats are a bit easier to crack).

AaroniusLeonius - 6 years ago

Wow. I did not know that. You learn new things every day. Thanks.

sometri - 2 years ago

help me how to recover my files with extension ".format". thanks.
