Threat Actor UAC-0056 Targeting Ukraine with Fake
Translation Software

March 15, 2022

Overview
SentinelOne has identified new malicious activity we assess to be closely associated with the
UAC-0056 (SaintBear, UNC2589, TA471) alert, in which the threat actor was observed
targeting Ukraine with Cobalt Strike, GrimPlant, and GraphSteel. This previously
undiscovered set of activity centers around a Python-compiled binary that masquerades as
Ukrainian language translation software, leading to the infection of GrimPlant, and
GraphSteel.
SentinelOne assesses UAC-0056’s GrimPlant and GraphSteel activity began in early
February 2022, while preparation for its use began at least as early as December 2021.

Dictionary Translator
SentinelOne has identified two files with names and paths correlating to the GraphSteel and
GrimPlant malware referred to in the report by CERT-UA.
C:\Users\user\.java-sdk\microsoftcortana.exe

d77421caae67f4955529f91f229b31317dff0a95

C:\Users\user\.java-sdk\oracle-java.exe

ef5400f6dbf32bae79edb16c8f73a59999e605c7

The two files identified are Go binaries dropped by the executable
2a60b4e1eb806f02031fe5f143c7e3b7 (dictionary-translator.exe). Dictionary-translator is a
Python compiled binary that functions as a 45 MB translation application. Notably, this file
was first uploaded to VirusTotal on February 11th 2022.

Translation Application
The Dictionary-translator binary is downloaded from the potentially actor-controlled domain:
hxxps://dictionary-translator[.]eu/program/dictionary-translator.exe .

On launch, the translator application drops and executes four malicious files. These correlate
to those described in the report by the Ukrainian CERT, three by name and path and one by
functionality and path.

Post-Compromise Activity
Upon execution, the GraphSteel variant of the malware will run a set of reconnaissance and
credential harvesting commands, again similar to those described in the report.
netsh wlan show profiles
[void]
[Windows.Security.Credentials.PasswordVault,Windows.Security.Credentials,ContentType=W
= New-Object Windows.Security.Credentials.PasswordVault;$vault.RetrieveAll() | % {
$_.RetrievePassword();$_} | Select UserName, Resource, Password | Format-Table HideTableHeaders
reg query HKCU\Software\SimonTatham\Putty\Sessions

Additionally, the malware achieves persistence by setting the current user’s registry
CurrentVersion\Run value to execute the Go downloader at logon:
Key: HKU\%SID%\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\Java-SDK
Value: \Users\user\.java-sdk\java-sdk.exe -a FIAjtW4f+IgCUrs3hfj9Lg==

The variant discovered by SentinelOne attempts to connect to a different server using a
similar pattern, attempting to establish a HTTP connection over port 443 to a single character
letter URI: hxxp://91.242.229.35:443/i .

Clarification on Threat Actor UAC-0056
UAC-0056 has a history of public reporting but is most commonly known as UNC2589
(Mandiant) and TA471 (Proofpoint), among others. This actor is believed to be behind the
WhisperGate activity in early January 2022 impacting government agencies in Ukraine.
Based on our analysis, the actor was potentially building the infrastructure for the GrimPlant
and GraphSteel campaign beginning in December 2021.
