BlackByte Ransomware has been in the news of late due to a successful attack against a
National Football League (NFL) Franchise and a Joint Cybersecurity Advisory by the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Secret Service (USSS) warning on
breaches to the networks of at least three organizations from US critical infrastructure
sectors in the last three months. BlackByte Ransomware is currently being offered to threat
actors as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) and makes use of PowerShell and Windows
CLI commands to carry out various tasks such as network discovery, task scheduling and to
create and disable Windows and security services.
BlackByte Ransomware makes files inaccessible by encrypting them and generates a
ransom note (the "BlackByte_restoremyfiles.hta" file) that contains instructions on how to
contact the attackers for data decryption and other details. Also, BlackByte appends the
".blackbyte" extension to the names of encrypted files. BlackByte does have worming
capabilities and can infect additional endpoints on the same network.

Recommended Steps to Prevent Initial Access
The Joint Cybersecurity Advisory provides several recommendations to secure your
environment against BlackByte that were gathered from their analysis of malware samples
discovered in the wild.
BlackByte operators have been observed exploiting the following CVEs to gain initial
access, patching is recommended to prevent exploitation.
CVE-2021-34473 - Microsoft Exchange Server Remote Code Execution
Vulnerability
CVE-2021-34523 - Microsoft Exchange Server Elevation of Privilege
Vulnerability
CVE-2021-31207 - Microsoft Exchange Server Security Feature Bypass
Vulnerability

Blocking IP Addresses known to download additional payloads in BlackByte attacks
prior to encryption: 185.93.6.31 and 45.9.148.114.
Disable unused remote access/Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) ports and monitor
remote access/RDP logs for any unusual activity.
After gaining access to the service accounts some adversaries have utilized AnyDesk
for lateral movement, monitoring for AnyDesk activity can be an early indicator of
compromise if AnyDesk is not utilized or allowed by your organization.
Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new or
unrecognized user accounts.
Disable hyperlinks in received emails.

Blocking BlackByte Attacks with Endpoint Security
Trellix ENS is currently detecting BlackByte Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) from the
standpoint of signature detections and the malware behavior associated with BlackByte
Ransomware attacks. The following Exploit Prevention Rule in ENS has shown success in
stopping BlackByte samples due to BlackByte being Script-based. Trellix always
recommends testing in Report Only Mode before blocking to confirm no false positives are
being detected by this signature rule.

BlackByte Threat Intelligence from the Trellix Advanced Threat
Research Team and MVISION Insights
MVISION Insights will provide the current threat intelligence and known indicators for
BlackByte Ransomware. MVISION Insights will alert to detections and Process Traces that
have been observed and systems that require additional attention to prevent widespread
infection. MVISION Insights will also include Hunting Rules for threat hunting and further
intelligence gathering of the threat activity and adversary.

Detecting Malicious Activity with MVISION EDR
MVISION EDR is currently monitoring for the activity associated with BlackByte
Ransomware and will note the MITRE techniques and any suspicious indicators related to
the adversarial activity. Several of the techniques outlined in the Joint Advisory that are
observed with BlackByte are noted below, monitoring for this type of activity can point to
activity associated with the Tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) for BlackByte.

Trellix offers Threat Intelligence Briefings along with Cloud Security and Data Protection
workshops to provide customers with best practice recommendations on how to utilize their
existing security controls to protect against adversarial and insider threats, please reach out
if you would like to schedule a workshop with your organization.
