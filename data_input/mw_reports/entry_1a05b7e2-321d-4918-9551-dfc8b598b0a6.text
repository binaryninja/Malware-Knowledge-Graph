According to the National Office for Cyber and Information Security, hackers have attacked
some Czech websites, including České dráhy (Czech railways), some regional airports, and
the civil service server operated by the Interior Ministry.
Russian hackers attacked the Internet systems of the Czech state and private institutions,
but no information and no private data of citizens have been leaked, Interior Minister Vít
Rakušan said at a press conference after a cabinet meeting today.

"The attack was aimed against the Czech Republic, its state and private institutions," he
said.

The Czech police organized crime squad (NCOZ) has been dealing with the DDoS attacks in
cooperation with the National Agency for Cyber and Information Security (NÚKIB), the police
said on Twitter.

"It has been detected in this case that it was an attack of Russian hackers against Czech
systems," Rakušan said.

He said it is necessary to be prepared since Russia does not consider Czechia a friendly
country in the current geopolitical situation.
NUKIB announced tonight that its website was attacked as well. Due to the DDoS attack, it
may happen that the website will not be accessible from abroad, it said on Twitter. Around
22:00 CEST the website was accessible from Czechia without any problem.
No severe impact has been caused so far, tweeted the National Office for Cyber and
Information security (NÚKIB) today.
Na Åadu ÄeskÃ½ch webÅ¯ probÃhaly DDoS Ãºtoky. Situaci vyhodnocujeme a
nadÃ¡le monitorujeme. V souÄasnÃ© dobÄ neevidujeme zÃ¡vaÅ¾nÃ© dopady.

NÚKIB said the so-called DDoS attacks were deployed against the Czech websites. This
type of cyberattack aims to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server by overwhelming
the target with flooded requests from unknown IP addresses.
Czech Railways has been tackling an outage on the Můj vlak (My train) mobile application
since Tuesday, railway spokesman Lukáš Kubát said on Wednesday morning. Buying tickets
online did not work, there were also problems finding connections.
Smaller Czech airports also came under attack. The Karlovy Vary airport registered a DDoS
attack on Wednesday night. The airport's website is still accessible from the Czech
Republic.
"By no means do the attacks affect the safety of transport," said the CEO of Karlovy Vary
Airport Alice Undus.

The Karlovy Vary Airport does not operate any regular airline, and the number of visitors to
its web is therefore low. "We are monitoring the situation, but I think this will gradually
subside," she said.

The international airport in Pardubice recorded a hacker attack on Wednesday.
"It caused us a failure of the entire web system, our website does not work," said airport
spokeswoman Mária Ministrová. The operation of the airport should not be affected by the
attack, but Pardubice Airport will have everything checked by the company that provides the
computer system.

"We are currently finding out what is happening, so I am not yet able to provide any relevant
information," said Kateřina Pustějovská on behalf of Ostrava Airport. According to her,
everything else works without problems.
In addition, a public administration portal was not available around 9 a.m. Wednesday.
"Since Tuesday evening, the website of the Public Administration Portal has been the target
of a cyber attack. For this reason, we have shut down the website and its security is currently
being strengthened," said Adam Rőzler, a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior. He
noted that users' data was safe.
"All systems that contain any data on citizens of the Czech Republic stood up to the attack. I
can assure everybody that no information and private data of the citizens got into the hands
of anybody who should not handle them," Rakušan said.

From the point of the ministry, the attack was a failure, he said.
Killnet named about ten attacked websites including the O2 mobile network operator and the
Komerční banka, which, nevertheless, registers no such attack. O2 registered increased
traffic on its servers, but the Internet services of O2 and its customers are adequately
secured, said Blanka Vokounová from the O2 press section.
In its statement on Twitter, the NÚKIB mentioned its previous warning of an increased risk of
cyber attacks in connection with Russia's continuing military aggression against Ukraine.

"The information we have leads to a reasonable fear of a real threat of cyber espionage and
cyber attacks on important targets in the Czech Republic, especially strategic public
administration institutions, elements of critical information infrastructure, basic services
information systems, and the media," stated an NÚKIB press release.
The Russian military attack on Ukraine started on February 24. On Tuesday, the NÚKIB
released the monthly statistics of cyber attacks for March, of which there were 14 in Czechia,
which corresponds to the average in the past 12 months. In March, it registered no incident
evidently linked to the war in Ukraine.
