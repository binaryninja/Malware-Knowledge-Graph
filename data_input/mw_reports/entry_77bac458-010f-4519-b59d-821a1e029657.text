Malicious Memes that Communicate with Malware

Steganography, or the method used to conceal a malicious payload inside an image to
evade security solutions, has long been used by cybercriminals to spread malware and
perform other malicious operations. We recently discovered malicious actors using this
technique on memes. The malware authors have posted two tweets featuring malicious
memes on October 25 and 26 via a Twitter account created in 2017. The memes contain an
embedded command that is parsed by the malware after it's downloaded from the malicious
Twitter account onto the victim’s machine, acting as a C&C service for the already- placed
malware. It should be noted that the malware was not downloaded from Twitter and that we
did not observe what specific mechanism was used to deliver the malware to its victims. The
malware connected to this malicious meme has been proactively blocked by Trend Micro
machine learning and behavioral detection technology at the time of discovery.
This new threat (detected as TROJAN.MSIL.BERBOMTHUM.AA) is notable because the
malware’s commands are received via a legitimate service (which is also a popular social
networking platform), employs the use of benign-looking yet malicious memes, and it cannot
be taken down unless the malicious Twitter account is disabled. Twitter has already taken the
account offline as of December 13, 2018.

Hidden inside the memes mentioned above is the “/print” command, which enables the
malware to take screenshots of the infected machine. The screenshots are sent to a C&C
server whose address is obtained through a hard-coded URL on pastebin.com.
Analyzing the Malware
We found that once the malware has been executed on an infected machine, it will be able to
download the malicious memes from the Twitter account to the victim’s machine. It will then
extract the given command. In the case of the “print” command hidden in the memes, the
malware takes a screenshot of the infected machine. It then obtains the control server
information from Pastebin. Afterwards, the malware sends out the collected information or
the command output to the attacker by uploading it to a specific URL address.

During analysis, we saw that the Pastebin URL points to an internal or private IP address,
which is possibly a temporary placeholder used by the attackers.

The malware then parses the content of the malicious Twitter account and begins looking for
an image file using the pattern: “<img src=\(.*?):thumb\" width=\".*?\" height=\".*?\"/>” on the
account.

At the time of analysis, the two memes (DqVe1PxWoAIQ44B.jpg and
DqfU9sZWoAAlnFh.jpg) contained the command “print”. The embedded commands instruct
the malware to perform various operations on the infected machine, such as capture
screenshots, collect system information, among others, as described below.
Once the malware downloads the image, it attempts to extract the command that starts with
the ‘/’ character.
