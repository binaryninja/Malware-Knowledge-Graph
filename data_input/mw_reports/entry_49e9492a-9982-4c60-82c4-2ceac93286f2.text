On twitter this weekend,@Timele9527 thought to found a new instance of APT
Sidewinder. https://twitter.com/Timele9527/status/1147750939576586244
After different analyses, It’s not APT Sidewinder.
The execution of the dropper: https://app.any.run/tasks/487b8762-997a-4d68-90721111b99967cf
The dropper uses the same techniques:
Downloading HTA
Decode backdoor and drops files in the %TEMP%
Use the same name “prebothta”
Use the same name of dll for the sideloading and the same legit software
But many things are completely different.

Operating Mode
First thing the droppers downloads the HTA file in vidyasagaracademybrg.in.
This website is an academic location.

After verification on Google Earth, this location exists really.

Or Sidewinder is linked to the India. It’s very strange for this group to compromise
website an Indian school to target Afghanistan People.
I think it’s not a fake website:

efaultaspx/197663174392792/

Network
The second way, it’s the nomenclature of name. Usually, Sidewinder uses domains near of
cdn names.
The protocols of the hta file and the backdoor is completely differents.
The backdoor used a text protocol without encryption
<|MAINSOCKET|><|ID|>760–858–340<|>6042<|END|><|PING|><|PONG|>
<|PING|><|PONG|><|SETPING|>62<|END|><|PING|><|PONG|>
<|SETPING|>62<|END|><|PING|><|PONG|><|SETPING|>62<|END|><|PING|>
<|PONG|><|SETPING|>62<|END|><|PING|><|PONG|><|SETPING|>62<|END|>
<|PING|><|PONG|><|SETPING|>62<|END|><|PING|><|PONG|>
<|SETPING|>62<|END|>
<|DESKTOPSOCKET|>760–858–340<|END|>
The id of the victim is in the protocol unusual.
Or Sidewinder use HTTP protocol for example:
for the HTA if all checks are ok:
GET /plugins/17285/93/true/true/
and the backdoor:
GET /ESmDEr7MDJw1r9jR9O4XGAVcBgCCySlZdmV3WU1J/17285/93/77223451/css
HTTP/1.1

Execution
The first stage of Sidewinder uses RTF exploits not an LNK in a Rar file.
Another thing is the persistence with .bat, usually it’s the RTF exploit which create a Run
Key.
The side loading loads duser.dll which executes an exe itstr.exe coded in delphi which is
the backdoor.

The lasted instance of Sidewinder the backdoor was written in C++ and his old backdoor
was coded in VB6.
This backdoor is executed in FUN_10001100

And this function is called by the dllmain.

Usually, Sidewinder uses a dll like backdoor not a executable file.
In the sequence of installation of the backdoor, this attack don’t use .NET serialization
and it’s an important feature of the Sidewinder.

About the Backdoor
The backdoor used is Allakore_Remote. It’s an opensource software written in Delphi.
https://github.com/Grampinha/AllaKore_Remote
We found the same protocol.

In this file
https://github.com/Grampinha/AllaKore_Remote/blob/master/Source/Client/Form_M
ain.pas we found many strings in the function FUN_0062ae18.
Sidewinder don’t use open source usually.

Threat Intelligence
This attack is against Afghanistan and the society participate at the conference of ICC at
Paris
