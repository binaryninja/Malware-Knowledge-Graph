Introduction
Here we go with another episode about our (not so) old friend, BRATA. In almost one year,
threat actors (TAs) have further improved the capabilities of this malware. In our previous
blog post [1] we defined three main BRATA variants, which appeared during two different
waves detected by our telemetries at the very end of 2021. However, during the last months
we have observed a change in the attack pattern commonly used.
In fact, the modus operandi now fits into an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) activity
pattern. This term is used to describe an attack campaign in which criminals establish a longterm presence on a targeted network to steal sensitive information.
Threat Actors behind BRATA, now target a specific financial institution at a time, and change
their focus only once the targeted victim starts to implement consistent countermeasures
against them. Then, they move away from the spotlight, to come out with a different target

and strategies of infections. At first glance, it seems to be a good strategy with a relevant pay
off. However, it’s important to point out also the struggles and the plan needed to apply this
pattern.
As we highlighted through our metrics, when a new release comes out there are also new
features that make it more dangerous. During the last months, a new BRATA.A variant has
been spotted in EU territory posing as specific bank applications, including some internal
changes, such as:
A new phishing technique that is in charge of mimicking a login page of the targeted
bank;
Brand new classes in charge to acquire GPS, overlay, SMS and device management
permissions;
Sideloading a piece of code (second stage) downloaded from its C2 to perform Event
Logging.
In this article, we give an overview of these new features in order to figure out their purposes
and forecast new evolutions.

BRATA updates
As we already mentioned in the previous paragraph, TAs are modifying their code in order to
tailor their malware on specific banking institutions. This code refractory is actually doing
small changes compared to old versions of BRATA, as there are a bunch of classes that
have been added for very specific purposes.
Nevertheless, before proceeding with a deep dive into BRATA’s features, in Figure 2 we have
highlighted all new functions that we observed in the last month. Most of them are very
specific and their purpose is crystal clear.

Speaking about examples, we could observe a login class that disguises a classic login page
in order to harvest credentials from unaware users, as well as classes like startactdevmang,
startactgpper, startactoverlay and startsmspermnew have been introduced to request
additional permissions for later fraud phases (e.g., device administration, gps, overlay, SMS,
etc. ).

Credential Harvesting Attack
Investigation on this sample has led our researchers to discover that BRATA has been
equipped with a phishing page that recreates a login page of a famous Italian bank. In this
way, TAs are trying to steal sensitive information from their victims to perform some sort of
social engineering in a later stage of the fraud. As shown in Figure 3, the victim is lured to
type Numero Cliente and PIN. This information is the foundation of the authentication
process commonly used by banks.

Figure 3 - BRATA phishing page
It’s worth mentioning that, at the time of writing, this information seems to be under
development. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that there is no data exchange
between the victim device and the TA infrastructure. Moreover, log information and local
databases did not show evidence that these information are stored somewhere on the
device. Another technique is related to the usage of screen recording functionality that could
avoid storing this information, however, adopting this strategy requires additional alerting
mechanisms in order to properly see all codes typed.
Furthermore, the current version of BRATA has introduced two new permissions inside the
AndroidManifest file, the RECEIVE_SMS and SEND_SMS. The combination of the phishing
page with the possibility to receive and read the victim’s sms could be used to perform a
complete Account Takeover (ATO) attack.

External Payload - Event logging
As we already mentioned above, after being correctly installed on the victim’s phone, this
BRATA version is going to download a .zip file from its C2. This file contains a jar file named
unrar.jar.

Figure 5 – BRATA external payload
From the information retrieved, this plugin seems to be in charge of monitoring events that
are generated from applications. More specifically, each time there is a change in a text view,
it stores within a local database a pair of Event Text and a Date when the event occurred.

Figure 6 – BRATA keylogger function
At the time of writing, this feature seems to be under development too. However, our
hypothesis is that TAs are trying to extend the functionality of the malware to get data from
other applications, abusing the Accessibility Service.

SMS Stealer
During our analysis of the last BRATA campaign, we found a suspicious app connected to
the same BRATA C2 infrastructure.

Figure 8 – Permissions declared inside the AndroidManifest file
Analyzing the suspicious app, we observed that the developer(s) of the app used the same
framework used in BRATA malware and also the same names for different classes (Figure
9).
Thanks to a deeper analysis, it is possible to say that the TAs have used some portions of
BRATA code’s to create this new malicious app. Our hypothesis is that TAs are trying to
develop new types of malware or they are just making some simple experiments to create
new types of attacks, like contacts harvesting or SMS sniffers in order to stay undetected.

The malicious app seems to target three different countries: Great Britain, Italy and Spain.
During the installation phases, in fact, it requires you to choose the language of the app.

Once installed, the pattern of the attack is similar to other SMS stealers. This consists in the
malicious app asking the user to change the default messaging app with the malicious one to
intercept all incoming messages, typically used by banks in PSD2 area for sending
authorization codes (2FA/OTP).

Figure 12 - factory reset command sent
The similarities between the SMS stealer and BRATA can be found in the network
communication since both use the following two different ports and the endpoint "/rdc":
Port 19999: used to notify to the C2 that the malicious app was installed on the victim
device
Port 18888: used to send SMS intercepted to the C2

Final Considerations
Starting from June 2021, when we first intercepted the BRATA campaigns in Italy, we
observed an uninterrupted evolution of both the malware and the attack methodologies used
by the TAs. The first campaigns of malware were distributed through fake antivirus or other
common apps, while during the campaigns the malware is taking the turn of an APT attack
against the customer of a specific Italian bank.
The latter trend, the so-called “Advanced Persistent Threat”, seems to be the attack pattern
that TAs are going to use in the coming year.. They usually focus on delivering malicious
applications targeted to a specific bank for a couple of months, and then moving to another
target.
