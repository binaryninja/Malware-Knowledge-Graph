Anchor Panda is an adversary that CrowdStrike has tracked extensively over the last year
targeting both civilian and military maritime operations in the green/brown water
regions primarily in the area of operations of the South Sea Fleet of the PLA Navy. In
1/3

addition to maritime operations in this region, Anchor Panda also heavily targeted western
companies in the US, Germany, Sweden, the UK, and Australia, and other countries
involved in maritime satellite systems, aerospace companies, and defense
contractors.
Not surprisingly, embassies and diplomatic missions in the region, foreign intelligence
services, and foreign governments with space programs were also targeted. We won’t share
too many details about this adversary – we don’t want to make it too easy for them – but we
will share some signatures specific to Anchor Panda. These signatures will help you find
Anchor Panda, just remember to change the Signature ID (sid).
