The Inception attackers have been active since at least 2014 and have been documented
previously by both Blue Coat and Symantec; historical attacks used custom malware for a
variety of platforms, and targeting a range of industries, primarily in Russia, but also around
the world. This blog describes attacks against European targets observed in October 2018,
using CVE-2017-11882 and a new PowerShell backdoor we’re calling POWERSHOWER
due to the attention to detail in terms of cleaning up after itself, along with the malware being
written in PowerShell.
Unit 42 has previously observed attacks from the group in 2017 against government targets
in Europe, Russia, and Central Asia and expects these to remain the primary regions this
threat is seen.
1/7

In the last writeup by Symantec they describe a two-stage spear phishing process used by
the Inception attackers, whereby the attackers first send a reconnaissance spear phish, and
follow this up with a second spear phish containing a remote template, which if loaded
delivers a first stage payload.
In their most recent attacks it appears that only one document is used, but in a way that
allows them to not reveal their final payload immediately; however, the use of templates
remains the same.
Remote Templates are Great
Remote templates are a feature of Microsoft Word which allow a document to load a
template to be used in a document – this template can be externally hosted, either on a file
share, or on the internet. The template is then loaded when the document is opened. The
Inception attackers use this feature in a malicious context as shown in Figure 1 below:

Figure 1. Overview of how the attack takes place.
Using a remote template in this way has been a consistent feature of the Inception attackers’
attacks for the past 4 years and has three main benefits to the attacker:
1. The initial document does not contain any explicitly malicious object, it simply
references an external object, meaning it should bypass static analysis techniques, an
example of how this appears in the document is shown in Figure 2.
2. The attacker has the option to deploy malicious content to the victim based upon initial
data received from the target, such as Microsoft Word version (sent in the User-Agent)
and the IP address of the target, see: Figure 1.
3. Once the attack is over, and the server hosting the remote template is down, it is
difficult for researchers to analyze the attack as the remote content is unlikely to be
available to them.

Figure 2. Example of how remote templates are referenced in Inception documents.
When opened, the documents display decoy content and attempts to fetch a malicious
remote payload via HTTP. The decoy content is usually copied from media reports, often with
political themes in the target regions, some examples of decoys observed are shown in
Figure 3, including invites to international conferences and news articles on the current
situation in Crimea.

Figure 3. Examples of decoys shown in Inception attacks in 2018. The first is taken from a
VGOPAD invitation sent on Facebook in 2017, the second is from a European Policy center
summary.
On most occasions the remote server did not return a malicious template, however we
recently observed two cases where a malicious template containing two exploits was served.
In both cases the template contained exploits for both CVE-2012-1856 and CVE-201711882, which target vulnerabilities in Word disclosed and patched in 2012 and 2017
respectively.
The payload for the exploits was VBScript in an OLE package object, which in turn decodes
and executes POWERSHOWER, a simple PowerShell backdoor.

POWERSHOWER – Malware that Cleans up After Itself
Earlier, we mentioned that previous attacks were apparently delivered over two spear
phishing emails, with the first only being used for reconnaissance. In the latest cases we only
observed a single document being sent to the targets, with reconnaissance, exploitation, and
payload delivery happening on the first attempt.
The dropped payload, POWERSHOWER, acts as an initial reconnaissance foothold and is
almost certainly used to download and execute a secondary payload with a more complete
set of features. By only using this simple backdoor to establish a foothold, the attacker can
hold back their most sophisticated and complex malware for later stages, making them less
likely to be detected.
In a nutshell, POWERSHOWER allows the attacker to:
Fingerprint the machine, and upload this information to the initial C&C.
Clean up a significant amount of forensic evidence from the dropper process, as we
detail below.
Run a secondary payload, if the attacker decides the target machine is sufficiently
interesting (based on analysis of the system data sent from the first beacon)
POWERSHOWER Analysis
POWERSHOWER first checks if Microsoft Word is currently running, if it is, then the malware
assumes it is the first run through of the malware and performs the following operations:
1. Writes itself to %AppData%\Microsoft\Word\log.ps1
2. Sets up persistence for this file, using a run key.
3. Adds a registry key so that future powershell.exe instances are spawned off-screen by
default – this trick is explained here.
4. Kills the Microsoft Word process.
5. Removes all files created during the dropper process, including evidence the original
document was opened, the initial .VBS file, and all temporary files associated with the
retrieval of the remote template in the IE temporary files directory.
6. Removes all registry entries that are left behind during the dropper process.
7. Collects system information on the infected machine and POSTS it to the C2.
If Microsoft Word is not running, the malware enters its main communications loop,
performing the following actions in sequence, this loop should only be entered after a reboot
of the machine:
1. Collects system information and POSTs it to the C2.
2. Performs a GET request

4/7

3. Based on the status code of the GET request it will branch operations:
If the status code is not 200, the malware sleeps for a random amount of time
between approximately 25 minutes and 35 minutes, based on a randomly
generated number.
If the status code is 200 the malware expects the response to:
Begin with an “P”; in which case the malware writes the response to disk,
presumably to be executed or used in a subsequent command.
Begin with an “O”; in which case the malware assumes the response
contains VBS code which is saved to disk, then executed.
If not beginning with either these characters, it is assumed to be an XML file
containing PowerShell expression, which is written to disk, read into
memory, deleted, and then executed.
The code behind the main C&C loop is shown in Figure 4.

Although the malware is simple, it’s fairly effective, giving the attacker options on how to run
their next, more sophisticated, payload.
Conclusion
The Inception attacks continue to mostly stay under the radar, which in part is down to the
effort put in by the attackers to make their attacks harder to analyze. In the latest wave of
attacks, they’ve done this through:
Use of remote templates, hindering analysis of historical attacks.

5/7

Anti-forensics techniques used during the dropper process to prevent clues as to how
the malware was installed - being left on disk or in the registry.
Use of the new basic POWERSHOWER backdoor as a first stage, making it harder for
researchers to get copies of more sophisticated payloads used by the attackers.
Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from this threat in the following ways:
Wildfire detects all current Inception remote template documents, and the downloaded
CVE-2017-11882 RTFs with malware verdicts.
Traps blocks all of the files we are aware of that are associated with this campaign.
