Protecting Against Cyber Threats to Managed
Service Providers and their Customers
SUMMARY
The cybersecurity authorities of the United Kingdom (NCSCUK), Australia (ACSC), Canada (CCCS), New Zealand
(NCSC-NZ), and the United States (CISA), (NSA), (FBI) are
aware of recent reports that observe an increase in
malicious cyber activity targeting managed service providers
(MSPs) and expect this trend to continue.[1] This joint
Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) provides actions MSPs and
their customers can take to reduce their risk of falling victim
to a cyber intrusion.

Tactical actions for MSPs and
their customers to take today:
•

•

Identify and disable
accounts that are no
longer in use.
Enforce MFA on MSP
accounts that access the
customer environment and
monitor for unexplained
failed authentication.
Ensure MSP-customer
contracts transparently
identify ownership of ICT
security roles and
responsibilities.

This advisory describes cybersecurity best practices for
information and communications technology (ICT) services
and functions, focusing on guidance that enables
•
transparent discussions between MSPs and their customers
on securing sensitive data. Organizations should implement
these guidelines as appropriate to their unique
environments, in accordance with their specific security
needs, and in compliance with applicable regulations. MSP
customers should verify that the contractual arrangements with their provider include cybersecurity
measures in line with their particular security requirements.
The guidance provided in this advisory is specifically tailored for both MSPs and their customers and
is the result of a collaborative effort from the United Kingdom National Cyber Security Centre (NCSCUK), the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS),
the New Zealand National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NZ), the United States' Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) with contributions from industry members of the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative

(JCDC). Organizations should read this advisory in conjunction with NCSC-UK guidance on actions to
take when the cyber threat is heightened , CCCS guidance on Cyber Security Considerations for
Consumers of Managed Services, and CISA guidance provided on the Shields Up and Shields Up
Technical Guidance webpages.

Managed Service Providers
This advisory defines MSPs as entities that deliver, operate, or manage ICT services and functions
for their customers via a contractual arrangement, such as a service level agreement. In addition to
offering their own services, an MSP may offer services in conjunction with those of other providers.
Offerings may include platform, software, and IT infrastructure services; business process and
support functions; and cybersecurity services. MSPs typically manage these services and functions in
their customer's network environment—either on the customer's premises or hosted in the MSP's
data center. Note: this advisory does not address guidance on cloud service providers (CSPs)—
providers who handle the ICT needs of their customers via cloud services such as Software-as-aService, Platform-as-a-Service, and Infrastructure-as-a-Service; however, MSPs may offer these
services as well. (See Appendix for additional definitions.)
MSPs provide services that usually require both trusted network connectivity and privileged access to
and from customer systems. Many organizations—ranging from large critical infrastructure
organizations to small- and mid-sized businesses—use MSPs to manage ICT systems, store data, or
support sensitive processes. Many organizations make use of MSPs to scale and support network
environments and processes without expanding their internal staff or having to develop the
capabilities internally.

Threat Actors Targeting MSP Access to Customer Networks
Whether the customer's network environment is on premises or externally hosted, threat actors can
use a vulnerable MSP as an initial access vector to multiple victim networks, with globally cascading
effects. The UK, Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and U.S. cybersecurity authorities expect
malicious cyber actors—including state-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) groups—to step
up their targeting of MSPs in their efforts to exploit provider-customer network trust relationships. For
example, threat actors successfully compromising an MSP could enable follow-on activity—such as
ransomware and cyber espionage—against the MSP as well as across the MSP's customer base.
The UK, Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and U.S. cybersecurity authorities have previously
issued general guidance for MSPs and their customers.[2],[3],[4],[5],[6],[7],[8] This advisory provides
specific guidance to enable transparent, well-informed discussions between MSPs and their
customers that center on securing sensitive information and data. These discussions should result in
a re-evaluation of security processes and contractual commitments to accommodate customer risk
tolerance. A shared commitment to security will reduce risk for both MSPs and their customers, as
well as the global ICT community.

RECOMMENDATIONS
MSPs and their Customers
The UK, Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and U.S. cybersecurity authorities recommend MSPs
and their customers implement the baseline security measures and operational controls listed in this

TLP:WHITE

TLP:WHITE

Product ID: AA22-131A

section. Additionally, customers should ensure their contractual arrangements specify that their MSP
implements these measures and controls.

Prevent initial compromise.

In their efforts to compromise MSPs, malicious cyber actors exploit vulnerable devices and internetfacing services, conduct brute force attacks, and use phishing techniques. MSPs and their customers
should ensure they are mitigating these attack methods. Useful mitigation resources on initial
compromise attack methods are listed below:
•

•

•

•

Improve security of vulnerable devices.
o Selecting and Hardening Remote Access VPN Solutions (CISA, NSA)
o Vulnerability Scanning Tools and Services (NCSC-UK)
Protect internet-facing services.
o Protecting internet-facing services on public service Critical National Infrastructure
(CNI) (NCSC-UK)
o Strategies for protecting web application systems against credential stuffing attacks
(CCCS)
Defend against brute force and password spraying.
o Microsoft update on brute force and password spraying activity (NCSC-UK)
o Russian GRU Conducting Global Brute Force Campaign to Compromise Enterprise
and Cloud Environments (NSA, CISA, FBI, NCSC-UK)
Defend against phishing.
o Phishing attacks: defending your organisation (NCSC-UK)
o Spotting malicious email messages (CCCS)

Enable/improve monitoring and logging processes.

It can be months before incidents are detected, so UK, Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and U.S.
cybersecurity authorities recommend all organizations store their most important logs for at least six
months. Whether through a comprehensive security information and event management (SIEM)
solution or discrete logging tools, implement and maintain a segregated logging regime to detect
threats to networks. Organizations can refer to the following NCSC-UK guidance on the appropriate
data to collect for security purposes and when to use it: What exactly should we be logging?.
Additionally, all organizations—whether through contractual arrangements with an MSP or on their
own—should implement endpoint detection and network defense monitoring capabilities in addition to
using application allowlisting/denylisting.
•

•

MSPs should log the delivery infrastructure activities used to provide services to the customer.
MSPs should also log both internal and customer network activity, as appropriate and
contractually agreed upon.
Customers should enable effective monitoring and logging of their systems. If customers
choose to engage an MSP to perform monitoring and logging, they should ensure that their
contractual arrangements require their MSP to:
o Implement comprehensive security event management that enables appropriate
monitoring and logging of provider-managed customer systems;
o Provide visibility—as specified in the contractual arrangement—to customers of
logging activities, including provider's presence, activities, and connections to the

o

customer networks (Note: customers should ensure that MSP accounts are properly
monitored and audited.); and
Notify customer of confirmed or suspected security events and incidents occurring on
the provider’s infrastructure and administrative networks, and send these to a security
operations center (SOC) for analysis and triage.

Enforce multifactor authentication (MFA).

Organizations should secure remote access applications and enforce MFA where possible to harden
the infrastructure that enables access to networks and systems.[9],[10] Note: Russian statesponsored APT actors have recently demonstrated the ability to exploit default MFA protocols;
organizations should review configuration policies to protect against “fail open” and re-enrollment
scenarios.[11]
•

•

MSPs should recommend the adoption of MFA across all customer services and products.
Note: MSPs should also implement MFA on all accounts that have access to customer
environments and should treat those accounts as privileged.
Customers should ensure that their contractual arrangements mandate the use of MFA on
the services and products they receive. Contracts should also require MFA to be enforced on
all MSP accounts used to access customer environments.

Manage internal architecture risks and segregate internal networks.

Organizations should understand their environment and segregate their networks. Identify, group, and
isolate critical business systems and apply appropriate network security controls to them to reduce
the impact of a compromise across the organization.[12],[13]
•

MSPs should review and verify all connections between internal systems, customer systems,
and other networks. Segregate customer data sets (and services, where applicable) from each
other—as well as from internal company networks—to limit the impact of a single vector of
attack. Do not reuse admin credentials across multiple customers.

• Customers should review and verify all connections between internal systems, MSP systems,
and other networks. Ensure management of identity providers and trusts between the different
environments. Use a dedicated virtual private network (VPN) or alternative secure access
method, to connect to MSP infrastructure and limit all network traffic to and from the MSP to
that dedicated secure connection. Verify that the networks used for trust relationships with
MSPs are suitably segregated from the rest of their networks. Ensure contractual agreements
specify that MSPs will not reuse admin credentials across multiple customers.

Apply the principle of least privilege.

Organizations should apply the principle of least privilege throughout their network environment and
immediate update privileges upon changes in administrative roles. Use a tiering model for
administrative accounts so that these accounts do not have any unnecessary access or privileges.
Only use accounts with full privileges across an enterprise when strictly necessary and consider the
use of time-based privileges to further restrict their use. Identify high-risk devices, services and users
to minimize their accesses.[14]
•

MSPs should apply this principle to both internal and customer environments, avoiding default
administrative privileges.

•

Customers should ensure that their MSP applies this principle to both provider and customer
network environments. Note: customers with contractual arrangements that provide them with
administration of MSP accounts within their environment should ensure that the MSP
accounts only have access to the services/resources being managed by the MSP.

Deprecate obsolete accounts and infrastructure.

Both MSPs and customers should periodically review their internet attack surface and take steps to
limit it, such as disabling user accounts when personnel transition.[15] (Note: although sharing
accounts is not recommended, should an organization require this, passwords to shared account
should be reset when personnel transition.) Organizations should also audit their network
infrastructure—paying particular attention to those on the MSP-customer boundary—to identify and
disable unused systems and services. Port scanning tools and automated system inventories can
assist organizations in confirming the roles and responsibilities of systems.
•

Customers should be sure to disable MSP accounts that are no longer managing
infrastructure. Note: disabling MSP accounts can be overlooked when a contract terminates.

Apply updates.

Organizations should update software, including operating systems, applications, and firmware.
Prioritize applying security updates to software containing known exploited vulnerabilities. Note:
organizations should prioritize patching vulnerabilities included in CISA’s catalogue of known
exploited vulnerabilities (KEV) as opposed to only those with high Common Vulnerability Scoring
System (CVSS) scores that have not been exploited and may never be exploited.[16],[17],[18],[19]
•
•

MSPs should implement updates on internal networks as quickly as possible.
Customers should ensure that they understand their MSP's policy on software updates and
request that comprehensive and timely updates are delivered as an ongoing service.

Backup systems and data.

Organizations should regularly update and test backups—including “gold images” of critical systems
in the event these need to be rebuilt (Note: organizations should base the frequency of backups on
their recovery point objective [20]). Store backups separately and isolate them from network
connections that could enable the spread of ransomware; many ransomware variants attempt to find
and encrypt/delete accessible backups. Isolating backups enables restoration of systems/data to their
previous state should they be encrypted with ransomware. Note: best practices include storing
backups separately, such as on external media.[21],[22],[23]
•

•

MSPs should regularly backup internal data as well as customer data (where contractually
appropriate) and maintain offline backups encrypted with separate, offline encryption keys.
Providers should encourage customers to create secure, offsite backups and exercise
recovery capabilities.
Customers should ensure that their contractual arrangements include backup services that
meet their resilience and disaster recovery requirements. Specifically, customers should
require their MSP to implement a backup solution that automatically and continuously backs
up critical data and system configurations and store backups in an easily retrievable location,
e.g., a cloud-based solution or a location that is air-gapped from the organizational network.

Develop and exercise incident response and recovery plans.

Incident response and recovery plans should include roles and responsibilities for all organizational
stakeholders, including executives, technical leads, and procurement officers. Organizations should
maintain up-to-date hard copies of plans to ensure responders can access them should the network
be inaccessible (e.g., due to a ransomware attack).[24]
•
•

MSPs should develop and regularly exercise internal incident response and recovery plans
and encourage customers to do the same.
Customers should ensure that their contractual arrangements include incident response and
recovery plans that meet their resilience and disaster recovery requirements. Customers
should ensure these plans are tested at regular intervals.

Understand and proactively manage supply chain risk.

All organizations should proactively manage ICT supply chain risk across security, legal, and
procurement groups, using risk assessments to identify and prioritize the allocation of
resources.[25],[26]
•
•

MSPs should understand their own supply chain risk and manage the cascading risks it poses
to customers.
Customers should understand the supply chain risk associated with their MSP, including risk
associated with third-party vendors or subcontractors. Customers should also set clear
network security expectations with their MSPs and understand the access their MSP has to
their network and the data it houses. Each customer should ensure their contractual
arrangements meet their specific security requirements and that their contract specifies
whether the MSP or the customer owns specific responsibilities, such as hardening, detection,
and incident response.[27]

Promote transparency.

Both MSPs and their customers will benefit from contractual arrangements that clearly define
responsibilities.
•

•

MSPs, when negotiating the terms of a contract with their customer, should provide clear
explanations of the services the customer is purchasing, services the customer is not
purchasing, and all contingencies for incident response and recovery.
Customers should ensure that they have a thorough understanding of the security services
their MSP is providing via the contractual arrangement and address any security
requirements that fall outside the scope of the contract. Note: contracts should detail how and
when MSPs notify the customer of an incident affecting the customer's environment.

Manage account authentication and authorization.

All organizations should adhere to best practices for password and permission management.
[28],[29],[30] Organizations should review logs for unexplained failed authentication attempts—failed
authentication attempts directly following an account password change could indicate that the account
had been compromised. Note: network defenders can proactively search for such "intrusion canaries"
by reviewing logs after performing password changes—using off-network communications to inform
users of the changes—across all sensitive accounts. (See the ACSC publication, Windows Event

for additional guidance.)
•
•

MSPs should verify that the customer restricts MSP account access to systems managed by
the MSP.
Customers should ensure MSP accounts are not assigned to internal administrator groups;
instead, restrict MSP accounts to systems managed by the MSP. Grant access and
administrative permissions on a need-to-know basis, using the principle of least privilege.
Verify, via audits, that MSP accounts are being used for appropriate purposes and activities,
and that these accounts are disabled when not actively being used.

APPENDIX
This advisory's definition of MSPs aligns with the following definitions.
The definition of MSP from Gartner's Information Technology Glossary—which is also referenced by
NIST in the Improving Cybersecurity of Managed Service Providers—is:
A managed service provider (MSP) delivers services, such as network, application,
infrastructure and security, via ongoing and regular support and active administration on
customers’ premises, in their MSP’s data center (hosting), or in a third-party data center.
MSPs may deliver their own native services in conjunction with other providers’ services
(for example, a security MSP providing sys admin on top of a third-party cloud IaaS).
Pure-play MSPs focus on one vendor or technology, usually their own core offerings.
Many MSPs include services from other types of providers. The term MSP traditionally
was applied to infrastructure or device-centric types of services but has expanded to
include any continuous, regular management, maintenance and support.
The United Kingdom's Department of Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport (DCMS) recently published
the following definition of MSP, which includes examples:
Managed Service Provider - A supplier that delivers a portfolio of IT services to business
customers via ongoing support and active administration, all of which are typically
underpinned by a Service Level Agreement. A Managed Service Provider may provide
their own Managed Services or offer their own services in conjunction with other IT
providers’ services. The Managed Services might include:
•

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Cloud computing services (resale of cloud services, or an inhouse public and private cloud services, built and provided by the
Managed Service Providers)
Workplace services
Managed Network
Consulting
Security services
Outsourcing
Service Integration and Management
Software Resale
Software Engineering
Analytics and Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery services

The Managed Services might be delivered from customer premises, from customer data
centres, from Managed Service Providers’ own data centres or from 3rd party facilities
(co-location facilities, public cloud data centres or network Points of Presence (PoPs)).
