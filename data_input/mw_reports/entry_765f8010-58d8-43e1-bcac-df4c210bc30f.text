Avira Labs Research Reveals Hydra Banking Trojan 2.0
targeting a wider network of German and Austrian banks

March 16, 2022

The Avira Threat Protection Labs team is a dedicated team, with team members based
around the world, which also has its own research arm – this research arm focuses on
emerging and developing threats.
The Hydra Banking Trojan malware has been targeting Android banking customers since
2019. Now, researchers in Threat Protection Labs have identified a new pattern and
technique in use, seeing this malware being poised and ready to be deployed to target a
wider set of Android users. The research team have seen that Hydra Banking Trojan 2.0, is
now preparing to target crypto apps, having previously focused on financial services and
banking customers – its evolution shows it as poised to target consumers via over 200
apps.
This new threat was first spotted in January 2022 by Avira’s Threat Protection team, leading
to a deep dive with conclusions reached in March 2022, shared below.

1. Introduction
While checking one internet monitoring cyber threat intelligence feed we noticed quite a
strange URL. The host was just an IP, no domain, ending with the mundane ’download.php‘.
Simple yet surprising when noticing it was serving an APK with a hash not seen anywhere
else before.

Figure 1: The URL serving malicious APKs
At that moment, little did we know it would lead to the discovery of an ongoing Hydra
campaign targeting ~50 million German and Austrian banking customers and potentially
many other targets.
Hydra is an Android BankBot variant, a type of malware designed to steal banking
credentials. The way it does this is by requesting the user enables dangerous permissions
such as accessibility and every time the banking app is opened, the malware is hijacking
the user by overwriting the legit banking application login page with a malicious one. The
goal is the same, to trick the user to enter his login credentials so that it will go straight to
the malware authors.

2. Ongoing Campaign
The campaign appears to have been running since the last quarter of 2021 and is still
ongoing at the time of writing this, March 2022
The host (172.121.14[.]62) from which this research started seems to have served more
than 30 different samples (at the time of writing this) related to this campaign.

Figure 2: List of malicious samples served by 172.121.14[ .]62Looking at the domains being
hosted on that IP we also notice a lot of phishing domains targeting BAWAG P.S.K. and

successfully detecting this malware and quarantining it – as per the detection names below
which appear when Avira picks up the malware, samples shown below – while we
continued to research this malware and establish its course:
ANDROID/Dropper.Agent.GAAN.Gen
ANDROID/Dropper.FKLB.Gen
ANDROID/Dropper.FKHF.Gen

3. Dynamic analysis
Moving forward to the analysis of the sample, the first step was to send it to our in-house
Dynamic Analysis Android Sandbox, aka DANY. After getting the behavioral report we
noticed some interesting things.
The Avira Dynamic analysis report revealed the following behaviour:
1. Accessibility service is used
2. Drops a DEX which gets deleted afterwards
3. Hides launcher icon
4. Saved preferences contain a list of other banking apps’ package names
5. Accesses an .onion DarkWeb URL
6. Drops a zip file from URL

3/22

What we mean by an .onion DarkWeb URL
The dark web, also known as the deep web or dark net, is a privacy-focused part of
the internet, running on the Tor Network. It’s harder to access, accessed through the
Tor Browser, or through connection to the network using a special library to handle the
necessary steps.
An .onion is a hidden service, a website running on the Tor Network. These domains
usually have random characters and end with the .onion extension. They can’t easily
be taken down by a central authority and the server hosting the website is difficult to
locate. Their appeal to those people behind the Hydra Banking Trojan 2.0, is that they
function on a private key mechanism. This means that anybody with the private key
can keep that website up and maintain control, so even if the server hosting the
website was found and taken down, in a short space of time the person with the
private key could simply start it up once again.
1. The app’s name is BAWAG PSK Security and the logo is similar to one used by an
Austrian Bank. Right off the bat it asks for accessibility permission.

4/22

Figure

4: First thing you see after opening the app
Usually banking apps don’t ask you for that kind of permission, some even refuse to
operate if you have a rooted phone, thus we can assume that this sample may be banker
malware looking to steal some credentials.
Banking malware has been going around for a long time and is here to stay, the Covid
pandemic has hugely accelerated the adoption of internet banking apps.

5/22

2. Nowadays, dropping a DEX file and deleting it is a practice used both by malware for
hiding reasons, but also by clean apps in an obfuscation attempt. But we’ll take note of it
and check it later
Figure 5:
Full path of the dropped DEX file (danyleted means the folder/file was deleted)
3. Now, hiding the app’s icon after giving the accessibility may also be a red flag, but it’s a
technique again, also used by clean apps, yet they announce this to you beforehand so
there’s nothing hidden under the table (or at least the good ones).
4. Looking over the Shared Preferences we notice a list of other banking and security apps’
package names under a key containing the word “injects”. We’re now highly suspicious.

Figure 6: Shared Preference with a key containing “injects” in itself, the value being a list of
mostly banking apps
5. Looking at the URLs accessed, we can see something really fascinating – an actual
working request to an .onion Tor (DarkWeb) URL. (Taking a small explanatory break: to
access an .onion URL you need to connect to the Tor network).
Now, when building DANY we didn’t add any Tor support by default, so unless it became
sentient, the sample downloaded what it needed to perform such a connection

Figure 7: List of accessed URLs

Figure 8: Process initiating a Tor network connection
Following the network trail, we can see that the sample downloaded Tor libraries from a now
inactive GitHub URL, then made a request to the .onion

Figure 9: The .onion and its base64 encrypted payload
the response being another url on the clearnet.
6/22

Figure 10: Decrypted base64 payload
By using an .onion to get the “real” URL the malware authors minimize their losses. When
the “real” URL’s domain gets taken down, another one can be set up and the response from
the .onion will simply be updated, as the .onion, by design, can only be taken down by the
one who holds its private key.
This way, if someone downloads the sample after a few years and the initial “real” URL was
banned, the infection will still be effective.
6. Continuing with the network path, the “real” URL is used to download a zip file.

Figure 11: Zip archive served by the “real” URL
What is in that archive you ask? Well that’s actually the core of the entire sample.

Figure 12: Contents of the malicious archive
Inside the inj folder is a list of folders containing phishing html kits, whereby the malware is
masquerading as reputable major banks in Germany and Austria such as: Volksbank, Bank
Austria, BAWAG P.S.K., CommerzBank, Deutsche Bank, easybank, Santander Consumer
Bank and some pin apps of Huawei and Samsung phones.

7/22

Figure 13: Phishing HTML for Bank of Austria login page
We observed some of them in a state of “TODO”, indicating they are the most probable next
targets.

Figure 14: “TODO” Phishing HTML masquerading as a CommerzBank login page
What is even more concerning is what was found in the other folder of the archive

8/22

Figure 15: Contents of icons folder
We came upon a stash of more than 200 icons belonging to European banking apps,
Crypto apps and other popular apps. All the indications point in conclusion towards this
malware campaign evolving throughout 2022, not only targeting a larger network of
European banks, but also targeting the crypto realm.
Based on this information alone we could label the sample as malware and write a
behavioral rule to detect this type of family, ensuring our systems maintain their high
detection rates. In addition to this, we’re now going the extra mile into the static analysis
realm – as there may be other dormant behavior or IoCs which could help us in finding
other samples and employ even better clustering techniques, to route this malware out.

4. Static analysis
Let’s take a look over the dropped dex, shall we?
Strings Encryption
The first thing we notice are the strings encrypted using XOR and a per class lookup table,
in a similar way Flubot does, thus using the same decryption method.

9/22

Figure 16: Encrypted strings, decryption key and decryption meth
Now that we can better understand what’s going on, let’s take a look over what is
happening with those icons and phishing html files at the code level.

Figure 17: onFcmmessageReceived methods checking the received message is a
notification calling another method onInjectNotificationReceived, passing the data along
The intercepted notification is now sent to the CC and also displayed without any change.
But what is up with that dropped folder with lots of apps icons? Well, due to some limitation
of Android, you can only get the launcher icon of an installed app, not the one displayed
inside the notification (yes, they are different). Thus, the malware authors made a big list of
icons for the intercepted notifications. Even though the notifications’ text is not manipulated
in any way now, in the near future it could be and the list of the dropped notification icons
may be the list of targets for that.

10/22

Figure 18: onInjectNotificationReceived code and exfiltration to the CC
When an app is started it will be checked to see if it is indeed one of the targets and our
research tells us that if that’s the case, the dropped html files will be used as a phishing
login page to collect the victims’ credentials.

11/22

Some other interesting capabilities include:
Exfiltrating all sent & received SMS text messages

CC at device/SMS endpoint

Cutting the internet connection surely will stop the malware from stealing
my stuff, right?
13/22

Figure 22: Methods used for starting Wi-Fi/Mobile Data
There is no benefit to cutting the connection, so that is not an option to stop this malware in
its tracks. The malware goes to the settings and enables the Wi-Fi/Mobile Data on its own.
The malware also checks if the execution environment is a popular Android emulator like
AVD, Genymotion or VirtualBox or a real Android device as shown in Figure 23.

Hiding the app from the launcher

Figure 24: The empty website, with the warning from the browser

‘What if we just delete the malware by going to the Settings and uninstall it,
even if it doesn’t have an icon?’

14/22

Figure 25: On line 889, the samples checks if its name aka “BAWAG PSK Security” is
present on the screen, does some sanity context checks (e.g. the text is not coming from
the sample itself being displayed, or the installer, etc) and clicks on the necessary button to
instantly get out of there)
Unfortunately that won’t help a consumer. Every time you manage to get there and click
Uninstall, it circumvents this tactic as you will discover you’re sent back to the Home
screen.

Exfiltrating the unlocking pin to the CC

Conclusion & further assumptions
In a nutshell, combining third-party cyber threat intelligence sources with Avira’s Behavioral
Analysis Android Sandbox, aka DANY, and some manual analysis we were able to gain a
better look at an ongoing malware campaign targeting users from major banks of Germany
and Austria.
While currently this campaign targets banking users from Central Europe, the artifacts
found make us believe they will soon expand to the rest of Europe, as Hydra Banking
Trojan 2.0 attempts to spread its tentacles. Moreover, at Avira our research highlights that it
will be aiming squarely at the crypto space, targeting even more people, as they access
crypto apps.
2022 may be the year of crypto malware. This type of malware has been on the rise and
this new research indicates just how crypto malware is set to aggressively target more
unsuspecting victims across Europe this year.

Recommendations
Sometimes, fast adoption of technology is a good thing, but being fast sometimes means
skipping steps in your growth. If you have people around you who are new to the realm of
Internet Banking like your parents or grandparents, please be patient and share some of
your internet behavior knowledge with them.
Also, here are some recommendations for being safe while doing banking from your phone:
1. Always keep your device up to date
2. Use a reputable mobile security solution for Android (such as Avira Antivirus Security,
Norton Mobile Security, or any other trustworthy solution), to help you avoid malware,
it’s certainly worth considering the free versions available.
3. Official Banking Apps are always on Google Play Store (or the equivalent official store
from your region), do not install apps by clicking on random links.
4. When in doubt, seek professional help.
5. Don’t click links in sketchy text messages. They can take you to spoof sites that look
real but will steal your personal information or install malware on your device.
