Summary
On 2021-05-01 another encrypted Mustang Panda PlugX binary was uploaded to VirusTotal.
Like the other samples, this encrypted PlugX file used a 10 byte prepended XOR key (a null
byte seperates the key from the encrypted contents).
10 Byte XOR Key: 0x47, 0x45, 0x48, 0x47, 0x7a, 0x67, 0x5a, 0x6e, 0x75,
0x6d

The decrypted file continues to embed shell code in the MZ header. The video below shows
the decryption process and the embedded shell code at the begining of the file.

This instance of PlugX checks for XXXXXXXX at the start of the config section. The RedDelta
varient uses ######## instead of 8 Xs.

Using data points extracted from our sample set, I filtered down the related samples based
upon the ones with a matching IP addresses. The interactive visualization below shows the
related samples and any property extracted where it was used by two or more samples.

We identified 40 additional PlugX samples upon expanding our pivot to include samples that
also matched on these properties. Theese samples span across both the XXXXXXXX and
######## varients.

This actually encompasses all of the MustangPanda/RedDetla PlugX samples I’ve in my
collection at this time.
Note: I’m still building out my collection, so overtime it will be apparent which property values
are worth pivoting on and which ones are not.
