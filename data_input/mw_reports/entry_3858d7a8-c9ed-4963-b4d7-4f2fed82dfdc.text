Research by: Cybereason Nocturnus Team

Background
Since December 2019, the Cybereason Nocturnus team has been investigating a campaign targeting
Palestinian individuals and entities in the Middle East, mostly within the Palestinian territories. This
campaign uses social engineering and decoy documents related to geopolitical affairs and relations
between the Palestinian government, and references Egypt, Hezbollah, and Iran.
Part one of this research investigates the Spark campaign, where attackers use social engineering to
infect victims, mainly from the Palestinian territories, with the Spark backdoor. For more information
about part one, click here.
During the attacks, victims are infected with a previously undocumented backdoor, dubbed Pierogi by
Cybereason. This backdoor allows attackers to spy on targeted victims. Cybereason suspects that the
backdoor may have been obtained in underground communities rather than home-grown, as the
evidence found in the code of the backdoor suggests it may have been developed by Ukranian-speaking
hackers.
The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), content, and theme of the decoy documents, as well as
the victimology observed in the campaign, resemble previous attacks that have targeted Palestinians. In
particular, these campaigns appear to be related to attacks carried out by a group called MoleRATs (aka,
Gaza Cyber Gang, Moonlight), an Arabic-speaking, politically motivated group that has been operating in
the Middle East since 2012.

Key Points
Cyber Espionage with a New Malware: The Cybereason Nocturnus team has discovered recent,
targeted attacks in the Middle East to deliver the Pierogi backdoor for politically-driven cyber
espionage.
Targeting Palestinians: The campaigns seems to target Palestinian individuals and entities, likely
related to the Palestinian government.
Using Geopolitically-charged Lure Content: The attackers use specially crafted lure content to
trick their targets into opening malicious ﬁles that infect the victim’s machine with the Pierogi
backdoor. The decoy content of the malicious ﬁles revolves around various political affairs in the
Middle East, speciﬁcally targeting the tension between Hamas and other entities in the region.
Perpetrated by an Arabic-speaking APT, MoleRATs: The modus-operandi of the attackers as
well as the social engineering decoy content seem aligned with previous attacks carried out by an
Arabic-speaking APT group called MoleRATs (aka Gaza Cybergang). This group has been
operating in the Middle East since 2012.

New Cyber Espionage Campaigns Targeting Palestinians - Part 2: The Discovery of the New, Mysterious Pierogi Backdoor

Infection Vector via Social Engineering
Similar to previous attacks, this campaign starts with social engineering. In one instance, it lures victims
to open an email attachment. In others, it persuades victims to download a report about a recent political
affair pertaining to the Middle East and speciﬁcally to Palestinian matters. In most cases, the
downloaded ﬁle is either an executable that masquerades as a Microsoft Word document or a
weaponized Microsoft Word document.

Decoy Content
As soon as the victim double-clicks on the dropper, they are presented with the decoy document. The
document lowers the victim’s suspicions by distracting them with a real document while the dropper
installs the backdoor. However, some of the documents also play an additional role in the attack. While

some are more neutral, quoting from newspapers and the media, others seem to report fake news to
spread misinformation that serves a political agenda. With regards to decoy content themes, this
campaign resembles previous campaigns reported in blogs by Vectra, Unit 42, and Talos. The contents
of the decoy documents seems to include:
Potentially fake documents that appear to be issued by the Palestinian government.
Meetings minutes of different Palestinian organizations.
News about Hamas and the Palestinian National Authority.
Potentially fake, leaked Hamas documents.
Criticism of and embarrassing content about Hamas.

The macro code embedded in the document is rather simple and is not obfuscated. In fact, it is almost
unusual in its unsophistication.
The macro code does the following:
1. Downloads a Base64 encoded payload from the following URL:
hxxp://linda-callaghan[.]icu/Minkowski/brown.
2. Writes the decoded payload to C:\ProgramData\IntegratedOfﬁce.txt.
3. Decodes the Base64 payload and writes the ﬁle to C:\ProgramData\IntegratedOfﬁce.exe.
4. Runs the executable ﬁle and deletes the .txt ﬁle.

Malicious macro code found in the phishing document.

Analysis of the Pierogi Backdoor
Pierogi, the backdoor in this attack, appears to be a new backdoor written in Delphi. It enables the
attackers to spy on victims using rather basic backdoor capabilities. While it is unknown at this point
whether the backdoor was coded by the same members of the group behind the attacks, there are
indications that suggest that the malware was authored by Ukranian-speaking malware developers. The
commands used to communicate with the C2 servers and other strings in the binary are written in
Ukrainian.
This is why we chose to name the malware Pierogi, after the popular East European dish.

New Cyber Espionage Campaigns Targeting Palestinians - Part 2: The Discovery of the New, Mysterious Pierogi Backdoor

Strings embedded in the backdoor binary that show Ukranian words.
The backdoor has the following capabilities:
Collects information about the infected machine.
Uploads ﬁles to the attackers’ server.
Downloads additional payloads.
Takes screenshots from the infected machine.
Executes arbitrary commands via the CMD shell.
In addition to spy features, the backdoor also implements a few checks to ensure it is running in a safe
environment. Speciﬁcally, it looks for antivirus and other security products.
1. The backdoor queries Windows for installed antivirus software using WMI: SELECT * FROM
AntiVirusProduct
2. It looks for speciﬁc antivirus and security products installed on the infected machine, such as
Kaspersky, eScan, F-secure and Bitdefender.

Strings of security products found in the backdoor code.

Persistence Mechanism
The backdoor achieves persistence using a classic startup item autorun technique:
1. A shortcut is added to the the startup folder:
C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup.
2. Once the user logs on to the infected machine, the shortcut points to the ﬁle binary location in the
C:\ProgramData\ folder.

The GUID generated by the malware is saved in a ﬁle called GUID.bin. This ﬁle is created in the same
folder as the binary of the backdoor (C:\ProgramData\GUID.bin).

C2 Communication by the Pierogi Backdoor
The backdoor has rather basic C2 functionality implemented through a predeﬁned set of URLs:
1. Sending machine information and a heartbeat to the C2:
URL: hxxp://nicoledotson[.]icu/debby/weatherford/Yortysnr
The information sent to the C2 includes:
cname: computer name, username, and GUID
av: Name of detected antivirus
osversion: version of the operating system
aname: the location of the malware on the infected machine

Sending basic information about the infected machine

2. Requesting commands from the C2 server:

Ekspertyza means expertise or examination in Ukranian. There are 3 basic commands coming from the
server in the form of md5 hashes:

Receiving command from the server to upload a screenshot of the infected machine’s screen.
3. Uploading data (mainly screenshots) to the C2:
URL: hxxp://nicoledotson[.]icu/debby/weatherford/Zavantazhyty
Zavantazhyty means to load or download in Ukranian. This command is used to upload collected data to
the C2 server. For example, in some instances the backdoor uploads screenshots taken from an infected
machine, as can be seen in the example below.

Vydalyty means to remove or delete in Ukrainian. The malware can delete various requests based
on the command below.

Recent Infrastructure
The records of the domains and IPs involved in this campaign seem to show that the attackers created a
new infrastructure speciﬁcally for this campaign. The domains were registered in November 2019 and
operationalized shortly after, as shown below.

Conclusion
In part two of this research, we examined the Pierogi campaign. Cybereason suspects this campaign
targets Palestinian individuals and entities in the Middle East, speciﬁcally directed at those in the
Palestinian government. The threat actors behind the campaign use social engineering to infect their
victims with the Pierogi backdoor for cyber espionage purposes.
The threat actor behind the attack invested considerable time and effort to lure their victims with
specially-crafted documents that target Palestinian individuals and entities in the Middle East. In our
analysis, we reviewed the TTPs and the decoy content, and pointed out the similarities between previous
attacks that have been attributed to MoleRATs, an Arabic-speaking, politically motivated group that has
operated in the Middle East since 2012.
The Pierogi backdoor discovered by Cybereason during this investigation seems to be undocumented
and gives the threat actors espionage capabilities over their victims. Based on the Ukranian language
embedded in the backdoor, Cybereason raises the possibility that the backdoor was obtained in
underground communities by the threat actors, rather than developed in-house by the group.
