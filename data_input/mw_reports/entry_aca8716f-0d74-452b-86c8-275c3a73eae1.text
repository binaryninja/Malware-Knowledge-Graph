Malware Masquerades as Privacy Tool

2/14

July 01, 2021 Selena Larson and Bryan Campbell

Key Findings
Threat actors created a detailed, legitimate looking “Privacy Tools” website to trick
victims into downloading malware.
The Privacy Tools site purports to offer file protection via encryption and decryption
services but leads to the installation of multiple malware families.
Smoke Loader is downloaded first as the malicious executable which drops follow-on
malware including Racoon Stealer and RedLine malware.

Overview
Proofpoint researchers found a new threat enticing users to download malware by
masquerading as a “Privacy Tools” service offering a tool that “encrypts” user data using a
zip-like utility. The fake website is professional-looking and contains detailed descriptions of
the alleged service including step-by-step instructions on how to download the privacy tools
– which turn out to be malware.
Proofpoint researchers identified the initial payload as Smoke Loader, a popular downloader
available on easily accessible forums for buying and selling malware and used by multiple
threat actors. The malware subsequently installs follow-on data-stealing malware including
Raccoon Stealer and RedLine. While investigating the observed campaign, Proofpoint
identified additional related samples publicly shared by other researchers since March 2021.
The privacy theme is ironic considering the ultimate payload is designed to exfiltrate
information from an infected host. However, it may appeal to users who are concerned about
data sharing and privacy – a number that is likely increasing due to the recent mainstream
marketing of user-focused privacy controls from major companies like Apple.

Campaign Details
3/14

The threat actors created a website offering privacy tools for business and personal use.

the website.

The compressed executables available for download purport to be file protection resources.
The website actually downloads Smoke Loader, a modular downloader with multiple
capabilities. Smoke Loader first appeared in 2011 and is available for purchase on criminal
forums. It is commonly used by threat actors that target both individual and corporate users.
Proofpoint researchers observed that the Smoke Loader infection subsequently downloads
follow-on malware to conduct information-gathering activities. Identified second-stage
payloads include RedLine and Raccoon Stealer malware. Additional security researchers
noticed this activity in 2021 along with Proofpoint observations.
Raccoon Stealer is an increasingly popular malware that first appeared in 2019. It was
advertised as a “malware as a service” on cybercriminal forums. It can steal credentials such
as passwords, website cookies, credit card data, system information, and bitcoin wallet
contents. RedLine Stealer is a malware that aims to steal information from browsers such as
5/14

login, autocomplete, passwords, and credit cards. It also collects information about the user
and their system, such as the username, location, hardware configuration, and installed
security software. An update to RedLine Stealer in early 2021 also added the ability to steal
cryptocurrency cold wallets.
Proofpoint does not attribute the activity to a specific group. One IP address identified in this
campaign is associated with OpenNIC, a public service used for resolving certain types of
domains that provides alternatives to domains not administered by ICANN. The privacythemed websites delivering Smoke Loader in this campaign were registered by
ssserviceshop1@yandex[.]ru via Registrar of Domain Names REG[.]ru, LLC. Multiple other
privacy-themed domains and C2 IPs were also registered with the same email address and
registrar.
Analyst Note:Previous research published in May 2020 attributed a Smoke Loader-related
domain registered with the same email and URL naming conventions as observed in this
campaign to TA505. Proofpoint cannot confirm the veracity of that reporting. There is no
available evidence to attribute the observed activity in the privacy-themed campaigns to
TA505.

Conclusion
The use of a privacy-themed lure to download information-stealing malware is an ironic yet
predatory mechanism for enticing users to download malware. The lure is likely effective as
the threat actors behind the campaign appear to have taken considerable time and effort to
design a legitimate-looking privacy tool.
Based on additional indicators uncovered, it is likely this threat actor is conducting – and has
previously conducted – similar campaigns using privacy themes and convincing lures to
distribute Smoke Loader and follow-on malware. Proofpoint anticipates this type of theme
and activity to continue, especially for consumers who do not have corporate privacy and
security services already installed on their hosts.
