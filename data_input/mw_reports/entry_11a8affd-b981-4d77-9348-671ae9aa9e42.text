White Rabbit Ransomware and the F5 Backdoor

January 2, 2022

On December 14, 2021, the Lodestone Forensic Investigations team responded to a client
whose environment was affected by what appeared to be a new strain of ransomware: White
Rabbit. Lodestone identified via open-source intelligence (OSINT) that White Rabbit was first
publicly disclosed on Twitter on the same date by security researcher Michael Gillespie
(@demonslay355).
Based on tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) observed in ongoing investigations and
further research, Lodestone has determined that the White Rabbit group may be affiliated
with known threat actor group FIN8. FIN8 is a financially motivated group active since 2016
that has targeted retail, restaurant, and financial institutions using social engineering and
spear-phishing attacks. Additionally, FIN8 has been linked to backdoor malware
PUNCHBUGGY and BADHATCH, and the memory scraping malware PUNCHTRACK. The
White Rabbit ransomware group appears to have leveraged a previously unseen version of
BADHATCH which, based on characteristics of the malware sample acquired, Lodestone has
named F5.
Lodestone has made preliminary observations of White Rabbit behavior that are described in
the text and screen captures below.

At the time of writing, the earliest evidence of compromise Lodestone has observed in its
investigations was a PowerShell script that executed on July 10, 2021. An analysis of
PowerShell script artifacts revealed script blocks that matched those described in a July 27,
2021, Bitdefender article on FIN8. Additional White Rabbit activity Lodestone observed
occurred on December 11, 2021; while the PowerShell artifacts from this most recent event
were similar to those associated with activity from August 30, 2021, these were not an exact
match.
Lodestone‚Äôs analysis of a White Rabbit sample from August 30, 2021, suggested that it was
an updated version of FIN8‚Äôs BADHATCH malware, also known as SARDONIC, that
contains the following PDB path:
‚ÄúC:\Users\dev_win10_00\
Documents\Sardonic\SardonicUtility\LoaderAssembly\obj\x86\Release\MSDAC.pdb‚Äù.
The December 11, 2021, sample, however, contains the PDB path below:
‚ÄúC:\Users\dev_win10_00\Documents\f5\F5Utility\LoaderAssembly\obj\x86\Release\Default.pdb‚Äù.

The exact relationship between the White Rabbit group and FIN8 is currently unknown.
However, Lodestone identified a number of TTPs suggesting that White Rabbit, if operating
independently of FIN8, has a close relationship with the more established threat group or is
mimicking them.
Lodestone will continue to provide updates with additional findings on this emerging threat.
