Lazarus Targets Latin American Financial Companies

November 20, 2018

The cybercriminal group Lazarus, and particularly its subgroup Bluenoroff, has a history of
attacking financial organizations in Asia and Latin America. There seems to be a resurgence
of activity from the group, and recent events show how their tools and techniques have
evolved. Just last week they were found stealing millions from ATMs across Asia and Africa.
We also recently discovered that they successfully planted their backdoor (detected by Trend
Micro as BKDR_BINLODR.ZNFJ-A) into several machines of financial institutions across
Latin America.
We determined that these backdoors were installed on the targets’ machines on September
19 2018, based mainly on the service creation time of the loader component. We also saw
that the attack technique bears some resemblance to a previous 2017 Lazarus attack,
analyzed by BAE Systems, against targets in Asia. The use of FileTokenBroker.dll was a key
part of the group’s attack in 2017, and they seem to have used the same modularized
backdoor in the recent incident as well.
Our analysis of the backdoors used in the September 2018 attacks show that
AuditCred.dll/ROptimizer.dll was similarly used:
FileTokenBroker.dll
(2017 attack)

AuditCred.dll/Roptimizer.dll
(2018 attack)

Analysis of backdoors used in 2018
The Lazarus group used a series of backdoors in their 2018 attacks, employing a
complicated technique that involves three major components:
AuditCred.dll/ROptimizer.dll (detected by Trend Micro as BKDR_BINLODR.ZNFJ-A)
– loader DLL that is launched as a service
Msadoz<n>.dll (detected by Trend Micro as BKDR64_BINLODR.ZNFJ-A) – encrypted
backdoor; n = number of characters in the loader dll’s filename
Auditcred.dll.mui/rOptimizer.dll.mui (detected by Trend Micro as
TROJ_BINLODRCONF.ZNFJ-A) – encrypted configuration file

Figure 1: Loading sequence of the modularized backdoor
The loader DLL is installed as a service and uses different names (AuditCred and
ROptimizer) on different machines. However, they still have the same capabilities and are
essentially the same file. Its purpose is to load Msadoz<n>.dll in order to decrypt and
execute it in memory.

If successfully installed, this particular backdoor poses quite a threat to its target. It is
capable of the following functions:
Collect file/folder/drive information
Download files and additional malware
Launch/terminate/enumerate process
Update configuration data
Delete files

Inject code from files to other running process
Utilize proxy
Open reverse shell
Run in passive mode — instead of actively connecting to the command and
control (C&C) server, the backdoor will open and listen to a port then receive
commands through it
Once the backdoor is loaded, it will then load the encrypted configuration file
Auditcred.dll.mui/rOptimizer.dll.mui to extract the C&C information and connect to it. The
connection is necessary for conducting activities; and based on the backdoor's functions,
these actions could be quite damaging to targets.

adjacent byte, starting from the last byte and excluding the first byte

first step as the RC4 key

It is also important to note that while the loader component and the configuration file are
located in the same directory (%windows%\system32), the encrypted backdoor is located in
a different directory (%Program Files%\Common Files\System\ado). This complex setup
makes it harder to detect and remove all the backdoors, and is more effective at hiding any
activities.
The complexity and the capabilities of these backdoors present a tough problem for the
targeted organizations. It is a sophisticated attack that needs equally sophisticated security
solutions.
Trend Micro Solutions
The Lazarus group is an experienced organization, methodically evolving their tools and
experimenting with strategies to get past an organization’s defenses. The backdoors they are
deploying are difficult to detect and a significant threat to the privacy and security of
enterprises, allowing attackers to steal information, delete files, install malware, and more.
These and other tools used by the Lazarus group can be mitigated by routinely scanning the
network for any malicious activity to help prevent the malware from entering and spreading
through an organization. In addition, educating employees and other key people in an

3/4

organization on social engineering techniques can allow them to identify what to look out for
when it comes to malicious attacks.
Other mitigation strategies include a multilayered approach to securing the organization’s
perimeter, which includes hardening the endpoints and employing application control to help
prevent malicious applications and processes from being executed.
Trend Micro endpoint solutions such as Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Suites and WorryFree™ Business Security can protect users and businesses from these threats by detecting
malicious files and spammed messages as well as blocking all related malicious URLs.
Trend Micro Deep Discovery™ has an email inspection layer that can protect enterprises by
detecting malicious attachments and URLs that could lead to malicious downloads.
Trend Micro XGen™ security provides a cross-generational blend of threat defense
techniques to protect systems from all types of threats. It features high-fidelity machine
learning on gateways and endpoints, and protects physical, virtual, and cloud workloads.
With capabilities like web/URL filtering, behavioral analysis, and custom sandboxing, XGen
security protects against today’s threats that bypass traditional controls; exploit known,
unknown, or undisclosed vulnerabilities; either steal or encrypt personally identifiable data; or
conduct malicious cryptocurrency mining. Smart, optimized, and connected, XGen security
powers Trend Micro’s suite of security solutions: Hybrid Cloud Security, User Protection, and
Network Defense.
