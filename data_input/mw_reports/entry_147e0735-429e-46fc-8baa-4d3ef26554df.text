New observations on BlackEnergy2 APT activity
The BlackEnergy malware is crimeware turned APT tool and is used in significant
geopolitical operations lightly documented over the past year. An even more interesting part
of the BlackEnergy story is the relatively unknown custom plugin capabilities to attack ARM
and MIPS platforms, scripts for Cisco network devices, destructive plugins, a certificate
stealer and more. Here, we present available data – it is difficult to collect on this APT. We
will also present more details on targets previously unavailable and present related victim
profile data.
These attackers are careful to hide and defend their long-term presence within compromised
environments. The malware’s previously undescribed breadth means attackers present new
technical challenges in unusual environments, including SCADA networks. Challenges, like
mitigating the attackers’ lateral movement across compromised network routers, may take an
organization’s defenders far beyond their standard routine and out of their comfort zone.

Brief History
BlackEnergy2 and BlackEnergy3 are known tools. Initially, cybercriminals used BlackEnergy
custom plugins for launching DDoS attacks. There are no indications of how many groups
possess this tool. BlackEnergy2 was eventually seen downloading more crimeware plugins –
a custom spam plugin and a banking information stealer custom plugin. Over time,
1/23

BlackEnergy2 was assumed into the toolset of the BE2/Sandworm actor. While another
crimeware group continues to use BlackEnergy to launch DDoS attacks, the BE2 APT appears
to have used this tool exclusively throughout 2014 at victim sites and included custom
plugins and scripts of their own. To be clear, our name for this actor has been the BE2 APT,
while it has been called “Sandworm Team” also.

The Plugins and Config Files
Before evidence of BlackEnergy2 use in targeted attacks was uncovered, we tracked strange
activity on one of the BlackEnergy CnC servers in 2013. This strangeness was related to
values listed in newer BlackEnergy configuration files. As described in Dmitry’s 2010 Black
DDoS’ analysis, a configuration file is downloaded from the server by main.dll on an infected
system. The config file provides download instructions for the loader. It also instructs the
loader to pass certain commands to the plugins. In this particular case in 2013, the config file
included an unknown plugin set, aside from the usual ‘ddos’ plugin listing. Displayed below
are these new, xml formatted plugin names “weap_hwi”, “ps”, and “vsnet” in a BlackEnergy
configuration file download from a c2 server. This new module push must have been among
the first for this group, because all of the module versions were listed as “version 1”, including
the ddos plugin:

2/23

Config downloaded from BE2 server
The ‘ps’ plugin turned out to be password stealer. The ‘vsnet’ plugin was intended to spread
and launch a payload (BlackEnergy2 dropper itself at the moment) in the local network by
using PsExec, as well as gaining primary information on the user’s computer and network.
Most surprising was the ‘weap_hwi’ plugin. It was a ddos tool compiled to run on ARM
systems:

Weap_hwi plugin
At first, we didn’t know whether the ARM plugin was listed intentionally or by mistake, so we
proceeded to collect the CnC’s config files. After pulling multiple config files, we confirmed
that this ARM object inclusion was not a one-off mistake. The server definitely delivered
config files not only for Windows, but also for the ARM/MIPS platform. Though unusual, the
ARM module was delivered by the same server and it processed the same config file.

Linux plugins
Over time we were able to collect several plugins as well as the main module for ARM and
MIPS architectures. All of these ARM/MIPS object files were compiled from the same source
and later pushed out in one config: “weap_msl”, “weap_mps”, “nm_hwi”, “nm_mps”,
“weap_hwi”, and “nm_msl”. It’s interesting that the BE2 developers upgraded the ddos
plugin to version 2, along with the nm_hwi, nm_mps, and nm_msl plugins.

3/23

They simultaneously released version 5 of the weap_msl, weap_mps, and weap_hmi plugins.
Those assignments were not likely arbitrary, as this group had developed BlackEnergy2 for
several years in a professional and organized style:
Config with a similar set of plugins for different architectures
Here is the list of retrieved files and related functionality:
weap

DDoS Attack (various types)

ps

password stealer handling a variety of network protocols
(SMTP, POP3, IMAP, HTTP, FTP, Telnet)

nm

scans ports, stores banners

snif

logs IP source and destination, TCP/UDP ports

hook

main module: CnC communication, config parser, plugins
loader

uper

rewrites hook module with a new version and launches it

4/23

Weap, Snif, Nm plugin grammar mistakes and mis-spellings
The developers’ coding style differed across the ‘Hook’ main module, the plugins, and the
Windows main.dll. The hook main module contained encrypted strings and handled all the
function calls and strings as the references in a large structure. This structure obfuscation
may be a rewrite effort to better modularize the code, but could also be intended to
complicate analysis. Regardless, it is likely that different individuals coded the different
plugins. So, the BE2 effort must have its own small team of plugin and multiplatform
developers.

5/23

Hook module structure
After decrypting the strings, it became clear that the Linux Hook main module
communicated with the same CnC server as other Windows modules:
The CNC’s IP address in the Linux module
This Linux module can process the following commands, some of
which are similar to the Windows version:
die

delete all BlackEnergy2 files and system traces

kill

delete all BlackEnergy2 files and system traces and
reboot

lexec

launch a command using bin/sh

rexec

download and launch file using ‘fork/exec’

update

rewrite self file

migrate

update the CnC server

Windows Plugins
6/23

After the disclosure of an unusual CnC server that pushed Linux and the new Windows
plugins we paid greater attention to new BE2 samples and associated CnCs.
During an extended period, we were able to collect many Windows plugins from different
CnC servers, without ever noticing Linux plugins being downloaded as described above. It
appears the BE2/SandWorm gang protected their servers by keeping their non-Windows
hacker tools and plugins in separate servers or server folders. Finally, each CnC server hosts
a different set of plugins, meaning that each server works with different victims and uses
plugins based on its current needs. Here is the summary list of all known plugins at the
moment:
fs

searches for given file types, gets primary system and network information

ps

password stealer from various sources

ss

makes screenshots

vsnet

spreads payload in the local network (uses psexec, accesses admin shares), gets
primary system and network information

rd

remote desktop

scan

scans ports of a given host

grc

backup channel via plus.google.com

jn

file infector (local, shares, removable devices) with the given payload downloaded
from CnC

cert

certificate stealer

sn

logs traffic, extracts login-passwords from different protocol (HTTP, LDAP, FTP,
POP3, IMAP, Telnet )

tv

sets password hash in the registry for TeamViewer

prx

Proxy server

dstr

Destroys hard disk by overwriting with random data (on application level and
driver level) at a certain time

kl

keylogger

upd

BE2 service file updater

usb

gathers information on connected USBs (Device instance ID, drive geometry)

bios

gathers information on BIOS, motherboard, processor, OS

7/23

We are pretty sure that our list of BE2 tools is not complete. For example, we have yet
to obtain the router access plugin, but we are confident that it exists. Evidence also supports
the hypothesis that there is a encryption plugin for victim files (see below).
Our current collection represents the BE2 attackers’ capabilities quite well. Some plugins
remain mysterious and their purpose is not yet clear, like ‘usb’ and ‘bios’. Why would the
attackers need information on usb and bios characteristics? It suggests that based on a
specific USB and BIOS devices, the attackers may upload specific plugins to carry out
additional actions. Perhaps destructive, perhaps to further infect devices. We don’t know yet.
It’s also interesting to point out another plugin – ‘grc’. In some of the BE2 configuration files,
we can notice an value with a “gid” type:

The addr number in the config
This number is an ID for the plus.google.com service and is used by the ‘grc’ plugin to parse
html. It then downloads and decrypts a PNG file. The decrypted PNG is supposed to contain
a new config file, but we never observed one. We are aware of two related GooglePlus IDs.
The first one, plus.google.com/115125387226417117030/, contains an abnormal number of
views. At the time of writing, the count is 75 million:

8/23

BE2 plus profile
The second one – plus.google.com/116769597454024178039/posts – is currently more
modest at a little over 5,000 views. All of that account’s posts are deleted.

Tracked Commands
During observation of the described above “router-PC” CnC we tracked the following
commands delivered in the config file before the server went offline. Our observation of
related actions here:
u ps

start password stealing (Windows)

Ps_mps/ps_hwi start

start password stealing (Linux, MIPS, ARM)

uper_mps/uper_hwi start

rewrite hook module with a new version and launch it
(Linux, MIPS, ARM)

Nm_mps/nm_hwi start –ban middle

Scan ports and retrieve banners on the router subnet

The issued commands for the Linux plugins suggest the attackers controlled infected
MIPS/ARM devices. We want to pay special attention to the DDoS commands meant for
these routers. 188.128.123.52 belongs to the Russian Ministry of Defense and 212.175.109.10
belongs to the Turkish Ministry of Interior’s government site. While many researchers
suspect a Russian actor is behind BE2, judging by their tracked activities and the victim
profiles, it’s still unclear whose interests they represent.
While observing some other CnCs and pulling down config files, we stumbled upon some
strange mistakes and mis-typing. They are highlighted in the image below:

10/23

BE2 config file mistakes
First, these mistakes suggest that the BE2 attackers manually edit these config files.
Secondly, it shows that even skilled hackers make mistakes.

Hard-Coded Command and Control
The contents of the config files themselves are fairly interesting. They all contain a callback
c2 with a hardcoded ip address, contain timeouts, and some contain the commands listed
above. We include a list of observed hardcoded ip C2 addresses here, along with the address
owner and geophysical location of the host:

It’s interesting that one of these servers is a Tor exit node. And, according to the collected
config files, the group upgraded their malware communications from plain text http to
encrypted https in October 2013.

BE2 Targets and Victims
BlackEnergy2 victims are widely distributed geographically. We identified BlackEnergy2
targets and victims in the following countries starting in late 2013. There are likely more
victims.
Russia
Ukraine
Poland
Lithuania
Belarus
Azerbaijan
Kyrgyzstan
Kazakhstan
Iran
Israel
Turkey
Libya
Kuwait
Taiwan
Vietnam
India
Croatia
Germany
Belgium
Sweden
Victim profiles point to an expansive interest in ICS:
power generation site owners
power facilities construction
power generation operators
large suppliers and manufacturers of heavy power related materials
investors
12/23

However, we also noticed that the target list includes government, property holding, and
technology organizations as well:
high level government
other ICS construction
federal land holding agencies
municipal offices
federal emergency services
space and earth measurement and assessment labs
national standards body
banks
high-tech transportation
academic research

Victim cases
We gained insight into significant BE2 victim profiles over the summer of 2014.
Interesting BE2 incidents are presented here.
Victim #1
The BE2 attackers successfully spearphished an organization with an exploit for which there
is no current CVE, and a metasploit module has been available This email message contained
a ZIP archive with EXE file inside that did not appear to be an executable. This crafted zip
archive exploited a WinRAR flaw that makes files in zip archives appear to have a different
name and file extension.

13/23

BE2 spearphish example
The attached exe file turned out to be ‘BlackEnergy-like’ malware, which researchers already
dubbed ‘BlackEnergy3’ – the gang uses it along with BlackEnergy2. Kaspersky Lab detects
‘BlackEnergy3’ malware as Backdoor.Win32.Fonten – naming it after its dropped file
“FONTCACHE.DAT”
When investigating computers in the company’s network, only BE2 associated files were
found, suggesting BE3 was used as only a first-stage tool on this network. The config files
within BE2 contained the settings of the company’s internal web proxy:

BE2 config file contains victim’s internal proxy
As the APT-specific BE2 now stores the downloaded plugins in encrypted files on the system
(not seen in older versions – all plugins were only in-memory), the administrators were able
to collect BE2 files from the infected machines. After decrypting these files, we could retrieve
plugins launched on infected machines: ps, vsnet, fs, ss, dstr.
14/23

By all appearances, the attackers pushed the ‘dstr’ module when they understood that they
were revealed, and wanted to hide their presence on the machines. Some machines already
launched the plugin, lost their data and became unbootable.
Destructive dstr command in BE2 config
file
Also, on some machines, documents were
encrypted, but no related plugin could
be found.
Victim #2
The second organization was hacked via the first victim’s stolen VPN credentials. After the
second organization was notified about the infection they started an internal investigation.
They confirmed that some data was destroyed on their machines, so the BE2 attackers have
exhibited some level of destructive activity. And, they revealed that their Cisco routers with
different IOS versions were hacked. They weren’t able to connect to the routers any more by
telnet and found the following “farewell” tcl scripts in the router’s file system:
Ciscoapi.tcl – contains various wrappers over cisco EXEC-commands as described in the
comments.
The comment includes a punchy message for “kasperRsky”:

15/23

BE2 ciscoapi.tcl fragment
Killint.tcl – uses Ciscoapi.tcl, implements destroying functions:

16/23

BE2 killint.tcl fragment
The script tries to download ciscoapi.tcl from a certain FTP server which served as a storage
for BE2 files. The organization managed to discover what scripts were hosted on the server
before BE/SandWorm gang deleted them, and unfortunately couldn’t restore them after they
were deleted. The BE2 actor performs careful, professional activity covering their tracks:
ciscoapi.tcl
killint.tcl
telnetapi2.tcl
telnetu.tcl
stub.tcl
stub1.tcl
There is evidence that the logs produced by some scripts were also stored on the FTP server,
in particular the information on CDP neighbors which is provided by one of the procedures of
ciscoapi.tcl.

17/23

Victim #3
The third organization got compromised by the same type of attack as the first one (an EXE
file spoofing a doc within a Zip archive). All the plugins discovered in BE2 files were known,
and there was no revelation of hacked network devices on their side and no destroyed data.
The noticeable thing is that many computers contained both BE2 and BE3 files and some
config files contained the following URL:
hxxps://46.165.222(dot)28/upgrade/f3395cd54cf857ddf8f2056768ff49ae/getcfg.php
The URL contains the md5 of the string ‘router’. One of the discovered config files contained
a URL with an as yet unidentified md5:
hxxps://46.165.222(dot)28/upgrade/bf0dac805798cc1f633f19ce8ed6382f/upgrade.php
Victim set #4
A set of victims discovered installed Siemens SCADA software in their ICS environment was
responsible for downloading and executing BlackEnergy. Starting in March 2014 and ending
in July 2014, Siemens “ccprojectmgr.exe” downloaded and executed a handful of different
payloads hosted at 94.185.85.122/favicon.ico. They are all detected as variants
of “Backdoor.Win32.Blakken”.

Build IDs
Each config file within BE2 main.dll has a field called build_id which identifies the malware
version for the operators. Currently this particular BE/SandWorm gang uses a certain
pattern for the build ids containing three hex numbers and three letters, as follows:
0C0703hji
The numbers indicate the date of file creation in the format: Year-Month-Day. Still, the
purpose of the letters is unknown, but most likely it indicates the targets. The hex numbers
weren’t used all the time, sometimes we observed decimal numbers:
100914_mg
100929nrT
Most interesting for us was the earliest build id we could find. Currently it is “OB020Ad0V”,
meaning that the BE2/SandWorm APT started operating as early as the beginning of 2010.

Appendix: IoC

18/23

Since BE dropper installs its driver under a randomly picked non-used Windows driver
name, there is no a static name for a driver to use it as IOC. The driver is self-signed on 64bit systems
However, new “APT” BE2 uses one of the following filenames that are used as an encrypted
storage for plugins and the network settings. They are consistent and serve as stable IoC:
%system32%driverswinntd_.dat
%system32%driverswinntd.dat
%system32%driverswincache.dat
%system32%driversmlang.dat
%system32%driversosver32nt.dat
%LOCALAPPDATA%adobewind002.dat
%LOCALAPPDATA%adobesettings.sol
%LOCALAPPDATA%adobewinver.dat
%LOCALAPPDATA%adobecache.dat
BE2 also uses start menu locations for persistence:
UsersuserAppDataRoamingMicrosoftWindowsStart
MenuProgramsStartupflashplayerapp.exe
BE3 uses the following known filenames:
%USERPROFILE%NTUSER.LOG
%LOCALAPPDATA%FONTCACHE.DAT
BE2 MD5s:
