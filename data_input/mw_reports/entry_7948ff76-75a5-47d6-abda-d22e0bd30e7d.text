3/31 UPDATE
After review and reverse engineering by the CrowdStrike Intelligence team, the signed MSI
(aa124a4b4df12b34e74ee7f6c683b2ebec4ce9a8edcf9be345823b4fdcf5d868) is malicious.
The MSI will drop three files, with the primary fulcrum being the compromised binary ffmpeg.dll
(7986bbaee8940da11ce089383521ab420c443ab7b15ed42aed91fd31ce833896).
Once active, the HTTPS beacon structure and encryption key match those observed by CrowdStrike in a March 7, 2023 campaign attributed
with high confidence to DPRK-nexus threat actor LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA.

Original Post

1/5

On March 29, 2023, CrowdStrike observed unexpected malicious activity emanating from a legitimate, signed binary, 3CXDesktopApp — a
softphone application from 3CX. The malicious activity includes beaconing to actor-controlled infrastructure, deployment of second-stage
payloads, and, in a small number of cases, hands-on-keyboard activity.
The CrowdStrike Falcon® platform has behavioral preventions and atomic indicator detections targeting the abuse of 3CXDesktopApp. In
addition, CrowdStrike® Falcon OverWatch™ helps customers stay vigilant against hands-on-keyboard activity.
CrowdStrike customers can log into the customer support portal and follow the latest updates in Trending Threats & Vulnerabilities:

CrowdStrike Falcon Detection and Protection

Watch how the CrowdStrike Falcon platform detects and prevents an active intrusion campaign targeting 3CXDesktopApp users.
The CrowdStrike Falcon platform protects customers from this attack and has coverage utilizing behavior-based indicators of attack (IOAs) and
indicators of compromise (IOCs) based detections targeting malicious behaviors associated with 3CX on both macOS and Windows.
Customers should ensure that prevention policies are properly configured with Suspicious Processes enabled.

Hunting in the CrowdStrike Falcon Platform
Falcon Discover

3/5

CrowdStrike Falcon® Discover customers can use the following link: US-1 | US-2 | EU-1 | US-GOV-1 to look for the presence of
3CXDesktopApp in their environment.
Falcon Insight customers can assess if the 3CXDesktopApp is running in their environment with the following query:
Event Search — Application Search
event_simpleName IN (PeVersionInfo, ProcessRollup2) FileName IN ("3CXDesktopApp.exe", "3CX Desktop App")
| stats dc(aid) as endpointCount by event_platform, FileName, SHA256HashData

Falcon Long Term Repository (LTR) powered by Falcon LogScale — Application Search
#event_simpleName=/^(PeVersionInfo|ProcessRollup2)$/ AND (event_platform=Win ImageFileName=/\\3CXDesktopApp\.exe$/i) OR
(event_platform=Mac ImageFileName=/\/3CX\sDesktop\sApp/i)
| ImageFileName = /.+(\\|\/)(?.+)$/i
| groupBy([event_platform, FileName, SHA256HashData], function=count(aid, distinct=true, as=endpointCount))

Atomic Indicators

Recommendations
The current recommendation for all CrowdStrike customers is:
1. Locate the presence of 3CXDesktopApp software in your environment by using the queries outlined above.
2. Ensure Falcon is deployed to applicable systems.
3. Ensure “Suspicious Processes” is enabled in applicable Prevention Policies.
4. Hunt for historical presence of atomic indicators in third-party tooling (if available).

CrowdStrike Intelligence Confidence Assessment
High Confidence: Judgments are based on high-quality information from multiple sources. High confidence in the quality and quantity of
source information supporting a judgment does not imply that that assessment is an absolute certainty or fact. The judgment still has a
marginal probability of being inaccurate.
Moderate Confidence: Judgments are based on information that is credibly sourced and plausible, but not of sufficient quantity or
corroborated sufficiently to warrant a higher level of confidence. This level of confidence is used to express that judgments carry an increased
probability of being incorrect until more information is available or corroborated.
Low Confidence: Judgments are made where the credibility of the source is uncertain, the information is too fragmented or poorly
corroborated enough to make solid analytic inferences, or the reliability of the source is untested. Further information is needed for
corroboration of the information or to fill known intelligence gaps.
