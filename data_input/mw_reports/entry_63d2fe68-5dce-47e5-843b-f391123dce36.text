APT38
attack.mitre.org/groups/G0082

APT38 is a North Korean state-sponsored threat group that specializes in financial cyber
operations; it has been attributed to the Reconnaissance General Bureau.[1] Active since at
least 2014, APT38 has targeted banks, financial institutions, casinos, cryptocurrency
exchanges, SWIFT system endpoints, and ATMs in at least 38 countries worldwide.
Significant operations include the 2016 Bank of Bangladesh heist, during which APT38
stole $81 million, as well as attacks against Bancomext (2018) and Banco de Chile (2018);
some of their attacks have been destructive.[1][2][3][4]
North Korean group definitions are known to have significant overlap, and some security
researchers report all North Korean state-sponsored cyber activity under the name Lazarus
Group instead of tracking clusters or subgroups.
