Executive Summary
Key Points:
 More than 2000 people are connected to the NEWSCASTER network of
false personas, which has existed since at least 2011.
 The personas are supported by fictitious personal content, family
relationships and the front media outlet NewsOnAir.org.
 Operators have intimated an interest in specifically targeted defense
contractors and senior military and government officials.
 Malicious activity is tied to personas and the NewsOnAir.org website,
and victims were sent links to credential collection websites that appear to be web portals.
 A review of the adversary's activities suggests they operate on Tehran's professional schedule.
Since at least 2011, a network of fake personas we have dubbed NEWSCASTER has been sending social
engineering content to senior military and government officials and the private sector in the US and
Israel. Many of the personas are linked to the fictitious news agency NewsOnAir.org, which reposts and
credits themselves with the work of other media outlets to legitimize personas as journalists. While the
ultimate sponsor of this activity is unknown, several indicators suggest it originates in Iran. This incident
underscores the threats posed by social networking platforms and affirms that enterprises must take
steps to control the human factors that may place them at risk. Though the covert nature of this
campaign obscures its impact, successful compromises could be leveraged for diplomatic, military and
other strategic advantages and possibly even used as reconnaissance for attack.

The NEWSCASTER Threat
We believe NEWSCASTER is a long-term, resource intensive cyber espionage
operation motivated by the prospect of strategic intelligence. Targeting,
professional operational schedule and complexity suggest this activity is
carried out by Iranian actors, though there is a dearth of information
implicating its ultimate sponsor.
 Personas are used to directly target several current and former senior
US military and diplomatic personnel and several specific defense contracting firms in the US and
Israel. Though targeting of organizational senior leadership and those associated with the defense
industrial base (DIB) are tactics that have been used in hacktivist activity, long-term persistent
reconnaissance and exploitation of specific targets is inconsistent with actors who intend to
ultimately expose their operations.
 The activity is carried out from infrastructure previously registered in Tehran and co-hosted with
other Iranian websites. The activity also appears to occur in line with a professional schedule
feasible for actors located in Tehran.
 The network of personas is exceptionally complex, including dozens of accounts with fictitious
personal and professional material, many of whom claim to work for the news provider
NewsOnAir.org.

Personas Across Multiple Platforms
iSIGHT Partners has uncovered multiple social networking accounts leveraged in a coordinated, longterm cyber espionage campaign since at least 2011. The network of personas is interconnected and
supported by an extensive social engineering regimen that crosses multiple social networking platforms
and websites.
 iSIGHT Partners has uncovered more than a dozen operational fictitious personas residing on
Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and other platforms connected to more than 2000 accounts.

Operational NEWSCASTER Personas

 All profiles are fictitious and use the pictures or information of real individuals, both public and
otherwise.
o Several personas used the names of real people while displaying alternative profile
images, while others used images of real people, to include the moderately famous,
paired with completely fabricated personas. For example, profiles purporting to be
associated with the journalist Sandra Maler of Thompson Reuters used identifying
profile images that clearly do not depict the known journalist. In addition, the Alfred

Nilsson persona uses images of Michael Mirisch, the founder of Los Angeles-based
charity Hollywood Knights.
o Multiple personas used the photographs of others connected to the network. The
fabricated NewsOnAir persona of Amanda Teyson used pictures of an Italian national
reenacting a World War II combat cameraman. The Italian national is friends with the
Adia Mitchell persona. Pictures used in the Dorotha Baash persona are taken from a
profile who is friends with the persona of Jeann Maclkin.
 Several personas are linked via claims of employment by the fictitious journalism organization
NewsOnAir. The NewsOnAir.org website uses news from other sources and credits it to the
affiliated personas.

NewsOnAir.org website

 Still others indicate they are members of a Nilsson family, whose patriarch is ostensibly Joseph
Nilsson, the persona who claims to have founded NewsOnAir.
 Additional ties include active social networking connections such as sharing and endorsements
and the reuse of distinctive language in profiles. For instance, several profiles intimated they
worked with targeted companies using the phrase, "I've some working between my company
[company they claim to work for] and your company [targeted company]."

Targeting
The network was principally leveraged against US and Israeli targets in public and private sectors,
though additional targeting included personnel from the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq,
Afghanistan and elsewhere. Though it is possible anyone connected to the network was compromised,
deliberate attempts to connect with certain entities suggest an interest in political, military, diplomatic
and technical intelligence. With the exception of personas that appear to be solely used to support the
bonafides of others, the majority of personas purport to be journalists, members of the military or
defense contractors.
 Several accounts intimated the targeting interest of the actors by creating profiles tailored to
targeted organizations. In passages in several profiles, the actors defined a relationship between
the company for which they claimed to work and the profile's reader, whom they referred to in
the first person and whose company they identified. These profiles intimated an interest in US and
Israeli defense contractors working in aerospace.

LinkedIn profiles indicated, in first person, which companies were specifically targeted

 Social networking accounts were found with extensive relationships to several current and former
flag officers of the US military and senior government officials. The deliberate nature of their
targeting was indicated by a long-term process of "friending"(or connecting their profiles to)
people with whom the target is familiar or intimately related, building bona fides prior to
ultimately friending the targeted person.
 Entities connected to the network included, but were not limited to:
o Several current and former senior members of the military
o Current and former senior foreign policy leaders, to includes those associated with
nuclear non-proliferation and sanctions
o Politicians and bureaucrats at the state and federal level with a particular concentration
around the state of North Carolina
o The US-Israel lobby
o Personnel from at least ten separate US and Israeli defense contractors
o Several other accounts that have no apparent connection to geopolitics or organizations
typically targeted in espionage activity
 Of note, a persona using the name Kendrick Babson is inconsistent with the aforementioned
targeting motivation demonstrated by the choice of associated occupation. While others leverage
military, DIB or journalist profiles, Kendrick Babson is purportedly an accountant working for a
payment processor.

NewsOnAir.org, the Nilsson Family and
Supporting Personas
Many of the personas claim to belong to the fictitious news organization NewsOnAir, which has its own
Facebook and LinkedIn presence and a content-rich webpage setup at NewsOnAir.org designed to
further legitimize the personas. Additionally, several of the personas are members of a fictitious
"Nilsson" family, which includes NewsOnAir's so-called founder. We anticipate that there are several
supporting personas that we have not yet identified that were created solely to legitimize other
personas.
 NewsOnAir.org is a website that features news stories updated several times weekly. The stories'
content is not original and is taken from other sources such as CNN, Reuters and the BBC. Stories
are frequently reposted with the bylines of the NewsOnAir personas and reposted to their social
networking sites.

Reuters article, reposted one day later to NewsOnAir.org and credited to Amanda Teyson (her name is misspelled, a
common mistake)

 After new stories are posted to the NewsOnAir site, links to the stories are shared through the
NewsOnAir Twitter account "@NewsOnAir2."
 In addition to Twitter, NewsOnAir maintains a presence on LinkedIn and Facebook.
 In addition to news content, the NewsOnAir website offers apps for download. A weather
application, a radio application and an application that reminds users to rest their eyes are offered
through the site. The applications are modified to call back to a server controlled by the operators
with user details, but no additional functionality was found.
 Several personas claim to be members of the Nilsson family or use the surname Nilsson. Joseph
Nilsson, Alfred Nilsson and Josh Nilsson appear to be actively associated with direct targeting, while
additional accounts with the Nilsson name appear to have been created to support the bonafides of
others.

High Value Targets (HVT) and Malicious Links

®,

7

In Facebook posts, personas intimated their fictitious familial relationships

Malicious Activity
Personas are linked through infrastructure to a number of credential collection sites, which we believe
are being leveraged to gain access to accounts of targeted personnel. These sites, which at first glance
appear to be the banal login pages for Yahoo, Google and Outlook Web Access, are linked to the
NewsOnAir.org infrastructure and can be leveraged to gain covert access to sensitive accounts.
Furthermore, other connected activity suggests additional, possibly nascent malicious capabilities that
are being deployed or have previously been used.
 NewsOnAir.org is connected to credential phishing sites associated with domain com-login.mobi
through links to eyeleo.com-login.mobi, offered as an App of the Week through the website.
Other sites hosted on the domain include:
o youtube.com-login.mobi
o login.yahoo.com-login.mobi
o accounts.google.com-login.mobi
o m.login.live.com-login.mobi

Credential collection site that resembles an Outlook Web Access portal

 Several of the sites hosted on com-login.mobi are fictitious login sites used to surreptitiously
collect unsuspecting visitors' credentials. The sites, which appear to be Outlook Web Access,
Yahoo and Google login pages, have been leveraged in spear-phishing messages containing links
that appear to be banal. The following link was used to send users to a credential collection page
prior to redirecting them to a YouTube clip posted by the persona Jeann Maclkin:
http://youtube.comlogin.mobi/watch.aspx?v=uYvYJtzT8js&feature=youtu.be&f=g&h=http://youtu.be/kxXA
2_4Yv2A
 EyeLeo and at least two other apps offered for download through the NewsOnAir.org website are
modified to send victim system information back to IP address 198.20.182.55. However, they do
not appear to have any additional functionality.
 An embedded and broken iFrame on NewsOnAir.org pointed to the domain internetexplorers.org.
The iFrame had an extraneous double quotation mark rendering the tag invalid.
 Multiple IRC malware samples were discovered that communicate with internetexplorers.org,
updatexplore.com and mcaffeea.com, domains associated through registrants and other
connections to NewsOnAir.org. All of the samples used the Persian term "parastoo" as a
password. Of the IRC malware analyzed, samples were configured to communicate with four
channels: "weather," "radio," "albert" and "tistani." Notably, two of the apps offered on the
website are radio and weather related.
 iSIGHT Partners linked the following infrastructure to the activity:

Iranian Origins
Targeting, social engineering ploys, adversary operational schedule and technical indicators suggest this
activity has an Iranian origin.
 In 2011 and 2012, the Adia Mitchell Facebook account "friended" multiple accounts associated
with conservative and North Carolina state politics. The persona proceeded to post awkward
attempts to engage Facebook friends in conversation regarding Iranian diplomacy, culminating in
the posting of an online poll in which friends of the account could participate.

Early Facebook activity included attempts to engage others on Iranian topics

 The distinctly Persian term "Parastoo" was used as a password for IRC malware associated
through infrastructure to this activity. While the term is not distinct to any operator (such as the
hacktivist Parastoo) it is distinctly Persian.
 NewsOnAir.org was previously registered in Tehran, and IP addresses used in infrastructure
almost exclusively host Iranian content, suggesting hosting was obtained from an Iranian provider
or intermediary.
 An analysis of Facebook activity indicates operators maintain regular hours that coincide with the
professional workday in Tehran, Iran. Furthermore, activity drops off midday Thursday and
resumes on Saturday, coinciding with the professional workweek.

Activity closely correlated with Tehran professional hours

Outlook and Implications
Cyber espionage activity with origins in Iran is not unprecedented. The Mahdi campaign, which largely
focused on targets in Iran, the Gulf States and Israel, was attributed by iSIGHT Partners to an Iranian
actor in 2012. Since then, iSIGHT Partners has tracked additional activity that appears to target Iran's
dissident population and the US defense industrial base, such as activity attributed to members of the
Ajax Security Team. International pressure and strategic uncertainty have almost certainly created an
exigent need for intelligence in the country, which has been recently publicly implicated in several
offensive cyber actions.
Given the covert nature of cyber espionage, its impacts are often difficult to forecast or measure;
however, in this instance, we expect any accesses obtained by the NEWSCASTER network will be
ultimately exploited for intelligence value. We infer, from our limited knowledge of NEWSCASTER
targeting, that such intelligence could ultimately support the development of weapon systems, provide
insight into the disposition of the US military or the US alliance with Israel, or impart an advantage in
negotiations between Iran and the US, especially with regards to sanctions and proliferation issues. It is
also possible that the compromise of such high-ranking and influential people could be used to access
the senior levels of as-of-yet unidentified organizations in the US, Israel, and elsewhere. Furthermore,
we surmise that access could be leveraged as reconnaissance-for-attack, supporting eventual disruptive
or destructive attacks against targeted entities. Though there is no evidence indicating the NEWSCASTER
network was created to support such activity, previous incidents publicly attributed to Iran, such as
Operation Ababil and the attacks on Saudi Aramco underscore this possibility.
Methods used in this campaign are not novel, but they are brazen, especially when compared with
short-term considerably less resource intensive efforts used by other cyber espionage actors. The
personal nature of this campaign sets it apart from others and raises concerns that threats to
organizations and personnel are not limited to enterprise systems or the office—social networking sites,
personal accounts and even family members can be a vector for compromise by an adversary who
compensates for sophistication with audacious, long-term actions.

Mitigation
We advise that victims and potential victims of this campaign consider the following course of actions:
•

If you suspect you may be a victim:
o Check for communications between enterprise system and known NEWSCASTER domains
and IPs.
o Check for communications to URLs associated with NEWSCASTER social network accounts.

•

If you determine you are victim:
o Immediately contact the Federal Bureau of Investigation at either your local FBI Cyber Task
Force or FBI CYWATCH:
E-Mail: cywatch@ic.fbi.gov
Voice: +1-855-292-3937

•

Above all:
o Never directly engage social network accounts.
o Never visit the Newsonair.org website or any other associated sites.
o Never disclose sensitive personally identifiable information on public social network sites.
o Only "friend" or "accept" invites on social network sites from people who you know.
o Be wary of unsolicited links and confirm their veracity whenever possible.

Technical Annex
Analysis of IRC Bot
Key Points:
 Analysis was performed on a binary and was found to be an IRC bot.
 Command and control (C&C) servers associated with the bot family include internetexplorers.org,
update.mcafeea.com and download.updatexplore.com.
Channels the bot attempts to join include #tistani, #Weather, #albert and #Radio. Each channel
uses the same password: "Parastoo."
 Victim usernames follow consistent naming convention, such "t__" followed by three digits.
Summary
iSIGHT Partners analyzed a malicious IRC bot. Several samples of the bot were found, all connecting to
shared infrastructure and using the same password to join channels on the network. From past data, it is
clear the IRC bot is intended for targeted operations, as the number of simultaneous users (8) allowed
onto the IRC server at a given time is extremely small.
In our search, we uncovered samples that communicated with internetexplorers.org,
update.macafeea.com and download.updateexplore.com. The channels the bots attempted to join
varied, but the most commonly seen channel was #tistani. Others observed were #Weather, #Radio and
#albert. Each used the same password for joining the channel "Parastoo."
Technical Details
Execution
When executed, the malware first writes a configuration file to a folder in the TEMP directory. This
configuration file contains a version number, the channel to join, two possible IRC nicks to use, a date
and an unknown number field. The IRC bot is then copied and executed; a batch file is also written that
sets the IRC bot's persistence mechanisms via registry.
After a period of sleeping, the bot attempts to join the IRC server, join the channel and await further
commands. Several of the strings in the bot are encrypted with a simple substitution cipher.
Some possible commands include:
 !DCC
 !SHLNV
 !SHLV
 !CMD
 !MSF
 !DSF
 !DWN
 !DWNEXE
 SETCUR
 EXE

 SETVER
 !INI
 DRIVE
 VIEW
 REN
 MOVE

The bot appears to be written to use a hard-coded boundary value for file transfers:
---------------------------7b4a6d158c9
This string appears in multiple Chinese-language forums regarding coding for file transfers.
The malware also uses the mutex "afOneCopyMutex" to ensure only one instance of the malware runs
at a time.
While the bot's full functionality was not tested, it appears capable of downloading remote files, file
execution and searching infected victims' disks.
Files Dropped
After successful execution, the malware drops the following files to victims' systems:




[TEMP]\System\Configuration.ini
o IRC Bot configuration
[ALLUSERSPROFILE]\WindowsUpdate\System\isass.exe
o IRC Bot
[TEMP]\lpt1\driver.bat
o Sets registry keys for malware persistence.

Persistence Method
While it was not observed during dynamic analysis, evidence indicates it is possible of maintaining
persistence via the following registry key:



Key: HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run\System
Value: [ALLUSERSPROFILE]\WindowsUpdate\System\isass.exe

Network Communications
After successful installation/initialization, the malware proceeds to make the following callback to the
C&C server over port (80/tcp):
Note: Victim to C&C in Red, C&C to Victim in Blue
USER AS_ # # :des
NICK t__516
JOIN :#tistani Parastoo
