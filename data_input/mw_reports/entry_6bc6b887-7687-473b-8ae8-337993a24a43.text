What is a cyberthreat?
As computers have permeated all aspects of life, the benefits have
been immense for many areas of the economy, including finance,
retail, industry, healthcare, education, and science. Today, business
and government policy alike are difficult to imagine without information technologies. But criminals have learned to use these systems
for unlawful purposes. The result is a constant battle between cyberoutlaws and security professionals. To survive, criminals constantly
refine their methods and tools, leaving greater numbers of digital
threats in their wake.
By cyberthreat, we refer to a confluence of factors and conditions
with the potential to compromise information security. In this report,
we will consider cyberthreats from the standpoint of the actions performed by criminals in cyberspace with the intention to breach an
information system for stealing data or money, or performing other
acts with the potential to cause harm to governments, businesses, or
individuals. Criminals may pursue these aims by targeting corporate
IT infrastructure, workstations, mobile devices, other software and
equipment, or humans themselves.

4

Trends and forecasts
Positive Technologies keeps monitoring the most important IT security threats. Cybercriminals are not slackening: they seize on news
of fresh vulnerabilities, react to cryptocurrency price changes, and
continue to refine their techniques.
Summarizing our findings from the second quarter of 2019, we
note the following trends:


The number of unique cyberincidents remains high, standing at
three percent higher than in Q1 2019.



Mass attacks are less common than targeted ones, which make
up 59 percent of the total (12% higher than in Q1).



Over half of all cybercrimes have data theft as their goal. Direct
financial gain motivated 42 percent of attacks on individuals and
30 percent of attacks on organizations.



In attacks on organizations, most stolen information consisted of
personal data (29%). Individuals stood to lose their credentials
and payment card information (44% and 34%, respectively, of all
information stolen from individuals).



Growth in the value of Bitcoin has inspired a revival of hidden
mining.



MageCart attacks are becoming more common. Experts have
noted the increased presence of JS sniffers even on sites that do
not handle payments.



Malware infections have become more common among government targets (62% compared to 44% in Q1 2019). Last quarter,
governments most frequently were hit by ransomware.



IT companies often serve as a stepping-stone in supply chain attacks. Email addresses from hacked IT vendors are actively used
by attackers in phishing messages.

5

Statistics
As in past quarters, data theft is the top goal of most cyberattacks. Direct financial gain, by contrast, is
sought in 30 percent of attacks on organizations and in 42 percent of attacks on individuals. The high
rate of financially motivated attacks on individuals owes to several factors: regular mass infections by
adware (including on mobile devices), infection by miners and other malware on dubious sites, and extortion campaigns in which the victim is threatened with compromising information.

Figure 1. Attackers' motives

Personal data and credentials are the most frequent item of interest for attackers targeting organizations.
This is no surprise, since companies can keep huge databases of clients' personal data and credentials. In
addition, attackers may be interested in the credentials of the employees of the victim company.
Social media accounts can also be of value to an attacker, especially if an account is highly popular with a
large number of subscribers. At the same time, users often fail to take basic precautions for securing their
accounts. They use weak passwords or re-use passwords across sites, enter their passwords without making sure of site authenticity, and give out information that could help to guess their password. These factors
explain the high rate of stolen credentials (44%) among attacks on individuals. For instance, computer
game fans form a high-risk category. In Q2, attackers lured Steam users to websites with the false promise
of a free new game, as long as the users would enter their Steam credentials first. Similar ruses can also be
found on gaming forums. A number of websites distributed the TurtleCoin cryptocurrency mining Trojan,
which was disguised as a ZIP file supposedly containing cheat codes.
Since payment cards and financial details are usually protected cryptographically, attackers' method of
least resistance is to trick people into disclosing this information via social engineering. Among attacks
on individuals, 34 percent of stolen data consists of payment card information.

Attack methods
We will take a closer look at each attack method and indicate which targets and industries were most
affected.

Malware use
Multifunctional Trojans constitute a growing share of attacks. For example, the DanaBot modular Trojan
we wrote about in Q1 now has ransomware capabilities. By comparison, another well-known piece of
ransomware, GandCrab, wound down and its operators announced the end of the malicious campaign.
Several weeks after reports indicated the end of development of the ransomware, security researchers
disclosed they had obtained access to the GandCrab servers. With the help of the encryption keys
stored there, it was possible to make a decryption program for the latest version of GandCrab so that
victims could recover their encrypted files.
Despite these events, the rate of ransomware attacks remains high. Creating a simple strain of ransomware does not even require custom code development. Most new ransomware is very similar to what already exists. Instead of developing code from scratch, cybercriminals can now just acquire ready-to-use
code or pay for a subscription (ransomware as a service) on the darkweb. So even with minimal upfront
investment, ransomware can bring a sizable income.
Reports have periodically appeared since April 2019 of attacks by new Sodinokibi ransomware. At least
three IT service providers have fallen victim to it. Cybercriminals have used remote administration tools
(Webroot and Kaseya) to install ransomware on the systems of clients of the compromised IT service
providers. But Sodinokibi has a few other tricks up its sleeve, in addition to supply chain attacks. It also
is spread via vulnerabilities in Oracle WebLogic Server and in phishing messages.

Figure 8. Types of malware

Email continues to be the most popular method for delivering malware. In Q2, experts noticed an uptick
in cases of Trojans being spread in the ISO disk image format. This trick has been used by AgentTesla,
LokiBot, and NanoCore. ISO images are often not scanned by antivirus software, since they may be
whitelisted. One giveaway is the file size: a malicious disk image will be smaller than 2 megabytes, while
a legitimate one will usually be much larger.

Figure 9. Malware distribution methods

We saw renewed criminal interest in cryptojacking in Q2 2019. With the Bitcoin price rising steadily, attackers continue to develop software for stealthy mining. Researchers at Sucuri discovered a miner with
improved persistence mechanisms: a special cron job (which is run periodically according to a schedule)
allows resuming mining even if the main malware module has been detected and removed from the
infected system.
Attackers widely distributed the AZORult infostealer in the second quarter. For instance, the experts at
the Positive Technologies Expert Security Center (PT ESC) in early April noted that the RTM group had
started using AZORult instead of Pony. In addition, the AZORult Trojan spreads via websites under the
guise of various utilities (such as the G-Cleaner system optimizer or Pirate Chick VPN client).

Social engineering
In Q2, criminals made active use of Azure App Service for different types of fraud involving social engineering. Azure can be used for quickly deploying phishing pages with fake login forms, as well as for
creating fake Microsoft technical support pages with popups stating the visitor's computer has been
infected by a non-existent virus. In addition, attackers send emails prompting to download a file after
logging in via a fake form, which is hosted on Azure Blob Storage. The scale and success of this scam is
caused in part by the domain (windows.net) and valid SSL certificate (belonging to Microsoft). But such
scams are hardly new. Instructions are available to users with the details of how to automatically block
such phishing emails.

Figure 10. Theft of Office 365 credentials with use of Azure Blob Storage

As noted already, the strong increase in Bitcoin value in Q2 sparked a return of interest in the cryptocurrency, including among the criminal community. In one iteration, fraudsters used a seemingly timeless
scheme. They claimed to be famous people or organizations offering cash prizes, with a catch: the "winner" must first transfer a small amount of money for verification purposes. In this case, the cryptocurrency "prizes" were supposedly being handed out by John McAfee and Elon Musk.
YouTube's popularity has made video channels an attractive place to put malicious links. In one fraud
campaign, viewers were shown links (in the video description) to materials allegedly teaching how to
generate bitcoins for free. But in reality, clicking the link initiated download of the Qulab infostealer.
Another such campaign used YouTube to spread the njRAT Trojan.

Hacking
The most discussed security issue of Q2 was BlueKeep (CVE-2019-0708), a critical
Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the RDS service in older versions of Windows.
Although Microsoft released a patch on May 14, many computers around the world remain at
risk. Attackers are actively probing for vulnerable hosts and developing exploits.
BlueKeep could be exploited to spread malware on the scale of WannaCry,
which is why installing Windows updates is so important

Hackers are making use of a vulnerability in the Exim mail server (CVE-2019-10149) to remotely run OS
commands with administrator privileges. One criminal group uses the vulnerability to place a backdoor
on target systems, by downloading shell scripts to mail servers and adding an SSH key to the root account. In addition, criminals illegally install cryptocurrency miners on vulnerable servers. The vulnerability was fixed by the Exim developers in February 2019. But release of a vendor update often fails to solve
the problem outright. Delays in installing updates give hackers a chance to successfully exploit even
vulnerabilities that are five years old.
Throughout Q2, attackers searched for publicly available Docker API instances by scanning the Internet
for hosts with open port 2375. Misconfigured Docker containers are used for a wide array of purposes.
After discovering a working container, for example, hackers might install Dofloo on it. This is the same
Trojan placed by attackers on systems running Atlassian Confluence. To do so, they exploit vulnerability
CVE-2019-3396. Dofloo uses the victim's resources to perform DDoS attacks and hidden cryptocurrency mining.

Web attacks
In Q2, web vulnerabilities were exploited in 18 percent of attacks on organizations. The wave since Q1
of attacks on payment sites continues to build. MageCart attacks with JS sniffers (malicious scripts designed to steal payment card information) hit Forbes, Puma, and numerous online stores. The criminals
regularly update their malicious scripts. The danger of JS sniffers is that the threat may stay unnoticed
by users, since the malicious scripts are invisible to them. But one of the new methods used by MageCart
to steal data may offer a way for attentive users to spot the threat. The attackers inject a form for entering card information into site pages. But normally this interface should be shown only after the user is
redirected to the secure page of the payment provider. Entering card information twice (first on the site
itself and a second time on the payment provider's page) should raise red flags among users.

12

Figure 11. MageCart form for stealing payment card information

In Q2, Malwarebytes Labs discovered MageCart JS sniffers in libraries stored by site developers in private
Amazon CloudFront CDN repositories. In addition, since April criminals have been injecting MageCart
sniffers into files on Amazon S3, leading to compromise of 17,000 sites. Since not all compromised sites
show a form for entering card information, experts gauge it likely that the hackers are using JS sniffers
for so-called mass spray and pray attacks.
Not all of the sites targeted are used for online purchases. In June, the Social Engineered blog, developed on MyBB, was hacked. Attackers took advantage of an XSS vulnerability in MyBB that had become
public several days prior. The attackers thus were able to obtain 55,000 sets of credentials and personal
messages of forum users.

Credential compromise
Weak passwords remain a major security threat. Passwords for 300 employees of Ethiopia's Information
Network Security Agency, charged with overseeing information security, proved to be weak and were
subsequently hacked and posted online. Out of 300 passwords, 142 were "p@$$w0rd" and another 60
were "123".
Credential stuffing (attempts to log in to a system using sets of credentials stolen elsewhere) remains
frequent. Such attacks resulted in the breach of around half a million user accounts for the Uniqlo and
GU online stores.
Q2 also marked attacks by the new GoldBrute botnet to bruteforce RDP passwords. Over 1.5 million
Windows devices have already been attacked. While the objectives of the attackers remain unclear,
they likely include selling the stolen credentials on the darkweb. Mass attacks on weak credentials are a
common occurrence for IoT devices as well. Silex malware, which attempts to log in to IoT devices using
standard sets of credentials, made the news in June. As soon as Silex successfully guesses a password,
it disables the device. Over 2,000 devices have incurred Silex's destructive power so far.

Most frequently, governments fall victim to ransomware. In the U.S. in early May, the entire IT infrastructure of Baltimore was inoperative for several weeks due to RobinHood ransomware. City authorities
estimated losses at over $18 million. Baltimore was not RobinHood's first victim: in April, the same ransomware infected the systems of the city of Greenville, also in the U.S.
Faced with the threat of an entire city government's IT systems going down, authorities in several cases
have had to give in to demands and pay a ransom. This is particularly the case in small cities with poorly developed IT infrastructure. The city council of Riviera Beach, Florida, unanimously voted to pay a
ransom of 65 bitcoins (approximately $600,000) since the city lacked the backups necessary to get its
systems running again.
Another Florida city, Lake City, was targeted by ransomware in early June. City information systems were
infected as part of the large Triple Threat malicious campaign first described in April by Cybereason.
The Triple Threat campaign received its name because of its three-part payload: phishing messages
delivered three different Trojans (Emotet, TrickBot, and Ryuk) to victim computers. Although infected
devices were disconnected from the city network as soon as possible, this was not fast enough to save
most phone and mail systems. Lake City decided to meet the attackers' demand of 42 bitcoins (approximately $530,000), after which the city's IT director was fired.
15

Yet another Florida city, Key Biscayne, came in the sights of ransomware attackers in late June. But in
this case the city refused to pay up.
Governments have suffered due to phishing as well. In one such attack in Canada, the city of Burlington
lost $503,000.
Government-related websites continue to attract ill-wishers. A hack of three websites of the FBI National
Academy Association resulted in posting of personal data for around 4,000 federal agents and law enforcement personnel online.

Figure 17. Data stolen

Almost all Q2 2019 attacks on industrial companies (96%) involved use of malware. The RTM group is
actively attempting to penetrate the internal IT infrastructure of industrial companies. PT ESC detected
26 malicious mailings by the group during the second quarter. Recipients included financial institutions
and over a dozen industrial entities in Russia and the CIS. All the messages were written in Russian and
tend to have a financial focus, claiming to include invoices, accounting paperwork, or related documents,
requesting to verify the documents, sign them, or make payment.
The RTM Trojan is classified as spyware: it steals credentials, records video, takes screenshots, and exfiltrates them to the attackers' server. Of interest, in June the group changed the method for getting the
IP address of its command-and-control (C2) server. Now the address is obtained with the help of logic
operations (AND and a right rotation) on the amount of a transaction received by a certain Bitcoin wallet.

16

Ransomware continues its assault on industry. Two such victims in Q2 included Aebi Schmidt, manufacturer of equipment for airports, and ASCO, a major aviation parts supplier.
Hackers frequently target the websites of industrial companies. Attackers placed the Emotet Trojan on
the website of Uniden. The site of Petrobangla, an oil and gas company, was hacked twice in the same
day. In the latter case, the attacker claimed to be pointing out security issues to the site owners.

Business-disrupting malware is especially dangerous in the healthcare sector: such incidents have the
potential to cause major harm to both institutions and patients. In April 2019, ransomware struck JFJ
Eyecare, encrypting the personal data of patients.
Healthcare employees are the frequent victims of phishing attacks. One healthcare employee in Nova
Scotia (Canada) fell for a message, supposedly from an IT department employee, requesting to send
account credentials to prevent a freeze. The attacker succeeded in getting the employee's username
and password, putting data for 3,000 patients at risk.
When targeting healthcare organizations, attackers can be interested not only in patients, but in employees as well. For example, for $500, it is possible on the darkweb to purchase sets of physician identity documents: medical diplomas, board recommendations, and medical licenses.

Several groups targeted financial institutions in phishing mailings in Q2. The Cobalt group continues its
attacks, of which PT ESC noted two in the outgoing quarter. In the second attack, the group switched
from tools it had used since late last year (COM-DLL-Dropper and a JavaScript backdoor) to using a
modified version of CobInt, which had been in their arsenal already from August to November 2018.
In June, PT ESC detected a phishing mailing from the Silence group disguised as being from a bank
client.
In May, PT ESC discovered phishing messages with encrypted archives containing an LNK file. When run
on the victim's computer, the LNK file downloads a PowerShell script, which collects system information
and sends it to the attackers. Based on this, the attackers chose which malware to install on the compromised computer. Network infrastructure allows us to identify this criminal group as FinTeam.
In Bangladesh, at least three banks were struck by hackers in Q2 2019: Dutch Bangla Bank Limited
(DBBL), NCC Bank, and Prime Bank. According to reports, the cyberattack on DBBL resulted in losses
of $3 million. Representatives of the other two banks reported no financial losses.

In the first half of April, vulnerabilities in an out-of-date Jenkins version yielded access to the infrastructure of Matrix, the decentralized messaging platform developer. Attackers' haul included unencrypted
messages, hashes of user passwords, and access tokens.
IT companies are frequent victims of supply chain attacks. Hackers broke into the systems of Wipro, one
of the largest Indian IT service providers with clients in the healthcare, telecom, and finance industries.
As the result of successful phishing attacks on Wipro infrastructure, over a dozen of the company's clients received emails (seemingly sent by Wipro employees) with malicious attachments. According to
Flashpoint, which performed investigation of the incident, one of the motivations for the attackers was
gift card fraud.
In mid-May, a supply chain attack hit cloud provider PCM. The attackers obtained access to the administrator account used at PCM to manage clients' Office 365 accounts. In this case, too, the motivation for
the theft included gift card fraud.

What companies can do to stay safe
Use proven security solutions


Implement a system for centralized management of updates and patches. To prioritize update plans correctly, the most pressing security threats
must be taken into account.



Install antivirus software with a sandbox for dynamically scanning files
and the ability to detect and block threats such as malicious email attachments before they are opened by employees. Ideally, antivirus software should simultaneously support solutions from multiple vendors and
have the ability to detect signs of hidden or obfuscated malware, as well
as block malicious activity across diverse data streams: email, web traffic, network traffic, file storage, and web portals. The solution must not
only check files in real time, but also automatically analyze files that have
already been checked; this will allow detecting new threats when signature databases are updated.



We also recommend using SIEM solutions for timely detection and effective response to information security incidents. This will help identify suspicious activity, prevent infrastructure hacking, detect attackers'
presence, and enable prompt measures to neutralize threats.



Use automated software audit tools to identify vulnerabilities.



Use web application firewalls as a preventive measure to protect websites.



Implement systems allowing deep network traffic analysis in order to
detect advanced persistent threats in real time and in saved traffic. Using
such solutions will allow you to detect previously unnoticed attacks and
monitor network attacks in real time, including use of malware and hacking tools, exploitation of software vulnerabilities, and attacks on the domain controller. Such an approach quickly identifies attackers' presence
in the infrastructure, minimizes the risk of loss of critical data and disruption to business systems, and decreases the financial damage caused by
the attackers.



Employ specialized anti-DDoS services.

Protect your data


Encrypt all sensitive information. Do not store sensitive information
where it can be publicly accessed.



Perform regular backups and keep them on dedicated servers that are
isolated from the network segments used for day-to-day operations.




Minimize the privileges of users and services as much as possible.
Do not use identical username–password combinations for multiple
systems.



Use two-factor authentication where possible, especially for privileged
accounts.

20

Do not allow weak passwords


Enforce a password policy with strict length and complexity requirements.



Require password changes every 90 days.



Replace all default passwords with stronger ones that are unique.

Monitor and stay current


Keep software up to date. Do not delay installing patches.



Test and educate employees regarding information security.



Make sure that insecure resources do not appear on the network perimeter. Regularly
take an inventory of Internet-accessible resources, check their security, and remediate
any vulnerabilities found. It is a good idea to monitor the news for any new vulnerabilities: this gives a head start in identifying affected resources and applying necessary
patches.



Filter traffic to minimize the number of network service interfaces accessible to an external attacker. Pay special attention to interfaces for remote management of servers
and network equipment.



Regularly perform penetration testing to identify new vectors for attacking internal
infrastructure and evaluate the effectiveness of current measures.



Regularly audit the security of web applications, including source-code analysis, to
identify and eliminate vulnerabilities that put application systems and clients at risk
of attack.



Keep an eye on the number of requests per second received by resources. Configure
servers and network devices to withstand typical attack scenarios (such as TCP/UDP
flooding or high numbers of database requests).

Keep clients in mind


Improve security awareness among clients.



Regularly remind clients how to stay safe online from the most common attacks.



Urge clients to not enter their credentials on suspicious websites and to not give out
such information by email or over the phone.



Explain what clients should do if they suspect fraud.



Inform of security-related events.

21

How vendors can secure their products


Follow all of the recommendations given in the section on corporate security.



Implement a secure development lifecycle (SSDL).



Regularly audit the security of software and web applications,
including source-code analysis.



Keep web servers and database software up to date.



Do not use libraries or frameworks with known vulnerabilities.

How users can avoid falling victim
Invest in security:


Use only licensed software.



Maintain effective antivirus protection on all devices.



Keep software up to date. Do not delay installing patches.

Protect your data:


Back up critical files. In addition to storing them on your hard drive, keep a copy
on a USB drive, external disk, or a backup service in the cloud.



Use an account without administrator privileges for everyday tasks.



Use two-factor authentication where possible, such as for email accounts.

Do not use weak passwords:


Use complex passwords consisting of at least eight hard-to-guess letters, numbers, and special characters. Consider using a password manager to create and
securely store passwords.



Set a different password for each site, email address, or other account that you use.



Change all passwords at least once every six months, or even better, every two to
three months.

Be vigilant:



Scan all email attachments with antivirus software.
Be careful when visiting sites with invalid certificates. Remember that information
entered on these sites could be intercepted by attackers.



Pay close attention when entering passwords or making payments online.



Do not click links to unknown suspicious sites, especially if a security warning appears.



Do not click links in pop-up windows, even if you know the company or product
being advertised.



Do not download files from suspicious sites or unknown sources.

About the research
In this quarter's report, Positive Technologies shares information on the
most important and emerging IT security threats. Information is drawn
from our own expertise, outcomes of numerous investigations, and data
from authoritative sources.
Any particular mass incident, such as a phishing campaign using malware,
is considered in this report as a single unique information security threat.
Each event is characterized by the following parameters:


Attack target is the target of destructive actions by cybercriminals. In
cases when social engineering is used to obtain information directly
from an individual, client, or employee, the attack target is "Humans" On
the other hand, when social engineering is part of an attempt to place
malware on corporate infrastructure or on the computer of an individual, the attack target is "Computers, servers, and network equipment."



Attack motive is the ultimate goal of cybercriminals. If an attack results
in theft of payment card information, the motive is "data theft."



Attack methods are a set of techniques used to achieve a goal. An attacker can perform reconnaissance, detect vulnerable network services
available for connection, exploit vulnerabilities, and get access to resources or information. For the purposes of this report, this process is
referred to as "hacking." Credential compromise and web attacks are
put in separate categories for greater granularity.



Victim categories are the economic sectors in which the attacked
companies operate (or individuals, if the attack was indiscriminate). For
example, the "Hospitality and entertainment" category includes companies providing paid services, such as consulting agencies, hotels, and
restaurants. The "Online services" category includes platforms where
users can fulfill their needs online, for example ticket and hotel aggregator websites, blogs, social networks, chat platforms and other social media resources, video sharing platforms, and online games. Large-scale
cyberattacks affecting more than one industry (most often, malware
outbreaks) have been placed in the "Multiple industries" category.

We believe that in most cases cyberattacks are not made public because
of reputational risks, which makes it hard even for companies involved in
incident investigation and analysis of hacking groups to calculate the precise number of threats. This research is conducted in order to draw the
attention of companies and ordinary individuals who care about the state
of information security to the key motives and methods of cyberattacks, as
well as to highlight the main trends in the changing cyberthreat landscape.
