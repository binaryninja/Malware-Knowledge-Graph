Nation-state Mobile Malware Targets Syrians with COVID19 Lures
blog.lookout.com/nation-state-mobile-malware-targets-syrians-with-covid-19-lures

Lookout researchers have uncovered a long-running surveillance campaign tied to Syrian
nation-state actors, which recently started using the novel coronavirus as its newest lure to
entice its targets to download malware.
This campaign appears to have been active since the start of January 2018, and targets
Arabic-speaking users, likely in Syria and the surrounding region. None of these apps were
available on the official Google Play Store, suggesting they were likely distributed through
actor-operated watering holes or third-party app stores. Lookout previously reported on
another surveillanceware campaign using COVID-19 related lures targeting Libya.

1/17

Applications from this surveillance campaign impersonate a variety of applications, with titles
such as “Covid19”, “Telegram Covid_19”, “Android Telegram”, and “Threema Arabic” (an
end-to-end encrypted messaging application), as well as a phone signal booster and
OfficeSuite application. Package names also allude to Syrian targeting, with names such as
“com.syria.tel”, “syria.tel.ctu”, and “com.syriatel.ctu”.

Syrian connections
Lookout researchers found 71 malicious Android applications connected to the same
command-and-control (C2) server. The IP address of the C2 server is located in a block of
addresses held by Tarassul Internet Service Provider, an ISP owned by – and sharing
network infrastructure with – the Syrian Telecommunications Establishment (STE) (Freedom
House, 2018). STE has a history of hosting infrastructure for the Syrian Electronic Army
(SEA), a Syrian state-sponsored hacking group. Notably, the C2 servers of SilverHawk, an
Android malware family previously reported on by Lookout researchers, were located on IP
addresses belonging to STE.
Not all applications in this campaign were completely scrubbed of sensitive information when
they were created. A large portion of the malicious applications are SpyNote samples, which
store C2 information, along with user inputted names, version numbers, and other
information, in res/values/strings.xml. In the strings.xml files of these applications, 22 APKs
reference “Allosh”, a name previously used in connection with a known Syrian Electronic
Army persona.
Previous strings appearing in other malware associated with the Syrian Electronic Army
contain this name, such as “c:\users\allosh hacker\documents\visual studio
2012\Projects\allosh\allosh\obj\Debug\Windows.pdb” mentioned in reporting by Citizen Lab
on the SEA malicious repackaging of the Psiphon 3 circumvention tool, and “c:\Users\Allosh
Hacker\Desktop\Application\obj\Debug\Clean Application.pdb” from pdb paths discovered in
binaries associated with SilverHawk infrastructure.

The Syrian Electronic Army has been active recently, with one of their Twitter accounts
claiming responsibility this month for DDoS attacks against Belgian media, as well as
defacing PayPal and eBay websites as recently as April 7, 2020.

Two of the most recent claims by @Official_SEA7, one of the Syrian Electronic Army’s
multiple Twitter accounts which has been active since 2013.
Syrian authorities are known to heavily censor their country’s internet, with Syria ranking
174th on Reporters Without Borders 2019 World Press Freedom Index. In addition,
according to the 2018 Freedom of the Net Report published by Freedom House, an NGO
which conducts research and advocacy on democracy, political freedom, and human rights,
“In areas controlled by the government, the Syrian Telecommunications Establishment (STE)
serves as both an ISP and the telecommunications regulator, providing the government with

tight control over the internet Infrastructure. Furthermore, private fixed-line and mobile ISPs
are required to sign a memorandum of understanding to connect to the international internet
via gateways controlled by the Syrian Information Organization (SIO)” (Freedom on the Net
2018).

After installation, the original Covid19 application hides its icon and only displays the newly
installed Degree Measure application.
The newly installed application (com.finger.body.temperature.ap) is a benign prank - a fake
digital thermometer that serves as a decoy. Meanwhile the malware continues to operate in
the background.

4/17

The user holds down on the screen on the fingerprint and is informed that their body
temperature is 35°C.
Some AndoServer samples are purely surveillanceware that do not even pretend to be
anything else, while others, like this sample here, contain legitimate applications inside the
malware, with the benign APK hidden in the res/raw folder.
AndoServer samples receive commands, and are capable of:
Taking a screenshot
Getting battery levels and if the device is plugged in
Reporting location (latitude and longitude)
Getting a list of installed applications
Launching an application specified by the malicious actor
Checking the number of cameras on a device
5/17

Choosing a specific camera to access
Creating a specific pop-up message (toast)
Recording audio
Creating a file on external storage
Exfiltrating call logs
Listing files contained in a specified directory
Calling a phone number
Exfiltrating SMS messages
Sending SMS to a phone number
Exfiltrating the contact list
Playing a ringtone and then sleeping
AndoServer malware has its C2 domain or IP address hard coded into the source code.
Each sample also has its own unique identifier string at the start of its communication with
C2 servers, that appears to be for the actor to monitor which application in their arsenal is
responsible for the compromise, as they can see the unique application installed by the
specific victim. While not always the case, some unique identifiers are similar to the name of
the C2 domain, while other times they refer to the title of the application, highlighting another
level of customization of this malware.

Prevalence of commercial surveillanceware
Of the malicious applications in this campaign, 64 of 71 are SpyNote samples, a well known
commercial surveillanceware family. The remainder belong to the SandroRat, AndoServer,
and SLRat families, of which the latter two have not yet been publicly reported on.
SLRat appears to have gained popularity since its developer first publicized it in May 2016,
advertising it as “the Best and Free android remote admin tool”, while AndoServer has not
yet been seen for sale or mentioned on public forums. Based on samples ingested to date
however, Lookout researchers believe it is also a customizable Android malware that may be
for sale, or only known about and used by a smaller group of operators.
Given Syria’s history of censorship and past mobile and desktop surveillance campaigns, it
should come as no surprise that another campaign is active. SilverHawk actors initially
entered the mobile malware space using the commercial Android surveillanceware
AndroRat, before customizing it and then developing their own mobile tooling. It is in line with
known TTPs that a new commercial or public spy tool might have been adopted and used by
this actor as part of new surveillance efforts, and there are likely more to be discovered.

Lookout has been ingesting samples from the AndoServer and SJRat families since 2016,
and has seen a spike in activity towards the end of 2019.
