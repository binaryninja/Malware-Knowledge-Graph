MuddyWater, also known as Static Kitten and Mercury, is a cyber espionage group that’s
most likely a subordinate element within Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS).
Since at least 2017 MuddyWater has targeted a range of government and private
organizations across sectors, including telecommunications, local government, defense, and
oil and natural gas organizations, in the Middle East, Asia, Africa, Europe, and North
America.
MuddyWater has various campaigns that are entirely different from each other. In this post
we will focus on the most recent changes and observations of their campaign which utilizes
spearphishing with legitimate remote administration tools.

Executive summary:
Deep Instinct’s Threat Research team has identified a new campaign of the
MuddyWater group.
The campaign has been observed targeting Armenia, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Iraq, Israel,
Jordan, Oman, Qatar, Tajikistan, and United Arab Emirates.
The campaign exhibits updated TTPs to previously reported MuddyWater activity.

Figure 1: Campaign overview

MuddyWater Exploiting Legitimate Tools
Previous research has shown that in 2020 MuddyWater sent spearphishing emails with direct
links as well as PDF and RTF attachments containing links to archives hosted at
“ws.onehub.com.”
Those archives contained the installer for “RemoteUtilities,” a legitimate remote
administration tool.
Since the beginning of 2021, MuddyWater has been observed sending spearphishing emails
containing either direct links or Word documents with links to archives hosted at
“ws.onehub.com.”
The archives from 2021 contained installers for ScreenConnect, another legitimate remote
administration tool.
This activity was observed intermittently through the end of 2021 and until July 2022.
In July 2022 a potential file related to this campaign was observed, but it contained Atera
Agent instead of the usual ScreenConnect, potentially signaling the threat actor switched to
another remote administration tool to avoid detection of their long running campaign.

A new discovery: The current MuddyWater campaign
The most recent MuddyWater campaign was observed by Deep Instinct in the beginning of
October and possibly started in the September timeframe.
What makes this campaign different from previous waves is the use of a new remote
administration tool named “Syncro.”￼

2/13

A new lure in the form of an HTML attachment was observed, along with the addition of other
providers for hosting the archives containing the installers of the remote administration tool.
The previous July sample with ScreenConnect mentioned earlier, was named
“promotion.msi.”
In the current campaign there was a sample that had few names; one of them was also
“promotion.msi.”
The above ScreenConnect sample was communicating with “instance-q927uirelay.screenconnect.com.” This instance was communicating with another MuddyWater MSI
installer named “Ertiqa.msi” which is a name of a Saudi organization.
In the current wave, MuddyWater used the same name “Ertiqa.msi,” but with Syncro installer.
The target geolocations and sectors also align with previous targets of MuddyWater.
Combined, these indicators provide us with enough proof to confirm that this is the
MuddyWater threat group.

EXAMPLE #1: Egyptian Hosting Company
Direct links to Dropbox:

Figure 2: Email containing direct link to Dropbox
This mail was sent from an Egyptian data hosting company, unlike previous campaigns using
OneHub. This time MuddyWater used Dropbox to host the archive with the Syncro installer:

HTML attachment leading to OneDrive:

Figure 4: Email containing HTML attachment
On the same date the email with the Dropbox link was sent, MuddyWater sent another email
from the same address of an Egyptian hosting company to another Egyptian hosting
company.
Instead of embedding a direct link in the email message, an HTML attachment was sent.
This is a well-known technique to build trust. The receiving end knows the company who
sent the mail. The attachment is not an archive or an executable which doesn’t raise enduser suspicion because HTML is mostly overlooked in phishing awareness trainings and
simulations.
HTML is considered “safer,” at least from an anti-virus (AV) and email security solutions point
of view. Although those solutions have the ability to scan HTML, they are often still delivered
to the recipients and not blocked.
The HTML itself is very small; its main function is most likely to bypass email solutions that
replace any link with “safe” link.

Figure 5: HTML attachment containing link to OneDrive
The link inside the HTML file leads to OneDrive this time, hosting an archive containing
Syncro MSI installer.

EXAMPLE #2: Israeli Hospitality Industry
In another example from early November, MuddyWater sent an email from a company in the
Israeli hospitality industry to a wide number of contacts across different Israeli insurance
companies:

Figure 6: Email containing HTML attachment
In this mail the company from the hospitality industry is looking for insurance.
The text is written in Hebrew, but a native speaker will find it suspicious due to a poor choice
of words.
Once again, the link leads to an archive hosted on OneDrive which contain Syncro MSI
installer:

Figure 7: HTML attachment containing link to OneDrive
Despite those new TTPs, most of the Syncro installers are still hosted in OneHub:

What is unclear is whether or not MuddyWater gained full access to the email server or only
the credentials to one email box. The emails are sent from legitimate corporate accounts. We
see that in spite of the low level of sophistication that this tactic can be effective.

Syncro: A tool used by multiple threat actors
MuddyWater is not the only actor abusing Syncro. It has also been observed recently in
BatLoader and Luna Moth campaigns.
Syncro is a fully-featured platform for Managed Service Provider’s (MSPs) to run their
business.

Figure 9: Sycnro Installer inside the MSI
Syncro provides an agent for MSPs to manage any device that has Syncro installed with the
custom-made provided MSI file that includes the customerID.

Syncro has a 21-day trial offer. You choose the subdomain to be used by your MSP:

Figure 11: Syncro trial sign-up screen with choice of syncromsp.com subdomain
While investigating some of the installers that MuddyWater used, we see that for each
unique mail a new MSI was used. In most cases MuddyWater used a single subdomain with
a single MSI installer.
It seems that most of the subdomains don’t have any useful meaning, although a few are
clear:
mohammadosman6060 and osmandembele4040 are football players
netanyahu8585 and benet5050 are the current and former prime ministers of Israel
Cham Wings is the name of a Syrian airline
The trial version contains the fully featured web GUI which allows complete control over a
computer with the Syncro agent installed:

9/13

Figure 12: Web GUI of Syncro with available remote administration features
Those features are standard for remote administration tools, such as terminal with SYSTEM
privileges, remote desktop access, full file system access, tasks, and services manager.
All those features combined with a signed MSI installer creates the perfect weapon for a
threat actor to gain initial access and start performing recon on the target. Later, they enable
the threat actors to deploy additional backdoors, exfiltrate files, or hand-off access to other
threat actors. A threat actor that has access to a corporate machine via such capabilities has
nearly limitless options.

Recommendations:
We have recently described other dual-use tools that are being abused for malicious
purposes. We recommend that security teams monitor for remote desktop solutions that are
not common in the organization as they have a higher chance of being abused.
