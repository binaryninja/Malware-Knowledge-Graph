Context
PrivateLoader is an active malware in the loader market, used by multiple threat actors to
deliver various payloads, mainly information stealer. Since our previous investigation, we keep
tracking the malware to map its ecosystem and delivered payloads. Starting from this tria.ge
submission, we recognized a now familiar first payload, namely PrivateLoader. However, the
dropped stealer was not part of our stealer growing collection, notably including RedLine or
Raccoon. Eventually SEKOIA.IO realised it was a new undocumented stealer, known as
RisePro. This article aims at presenting SEKOIA.IO RisePro information stealer analysis.

Quick infection review
Based on the tria.ge submission, the first payload is a PrivateLoader. The sample fetches a
document hosted on sun6-23.userapi.com. This dropped file is the starting point of this
analysis.
The downloaded file is obfuscated using bytes substitution followed by a XOR operation with
a fixed key. (See: deobfuscation script in the annex). Tria.ge automatic analysis suggests a
stealer.
PrivateLoader SHA-1: da3aea62ddf57c895acf630b62e972ef70defb60
Download BMP SHA-1: d94e061e93f7ac003b01c0c9d12dbbb26f87d13e
Deobfuscated BMP SHA-1: 17ba58fcfe47c49baeaba9aaebd8f888ed2d9473
NB-1: The PCAP of the initial payload shows requests to RisePro infrastructure before
PrivateLoader communication. Hypotheses about the future of the Stealer are presented in
the conclusion.
NB-2: The name of the distributed payload by PrivateLoader is StealerClient.bmp.

Malware analysis
The stealer offers similar functionalities as other malware of the family. It targets a wide range
of web browsers for credentials, cookies, credit cards and crypto wallet via web browser
extensions and 2FA software, and a file grabber functionality. To reduce its detection,
RisePro hides its configuration such as string or imported DLLs using XOR instructions using
different keys. The malware communicates over HTTP and content of the communication is
obfuscated using bytes substitutions and XOR operations. Finally, the malware has the
capability to load other payloads.

Dynamic lookup of APIs via GetProcAddress
The malware obfuscates its strings using XORed 128 bits (representing integer data). The
image below highlights the deobfuscation routine, as well as the dynamic function loading
using the technique GetModuleHandle technique associated with GetProcAddress.

Embedded DLLs
Some samples of RisePro embed legitimate DLLs such as sqlite3.dll and mozglue.dll used to
access the web browsers data. Theses DLLs are stored in cleartext in the PE, they are
dumped on the disk in the working directory of the malware: (working directory is composed of
C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Local\Temp\ followed by LocalSimbaD and ten random alphanum
characters).

4/22

Figure 3. DLLs dumping into the malware working directory
In case these DLLs are not embedded in the malware, it fetches them on its C2 by requesting
the /get_library endpoint with a POST request, where the body of the request is ‘name=<dll
name>’. The server answers the URL to download the requested DLLs. Every C2 tracked by
SEKOIA.IO host the DLLs under the /static/ directory:

web directory

Host fingerprinting
RisePro Stealer has a fingerprint capability, all information are retrieved in the following
registry keys:
SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography
SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion
HARDWARE\DESCRIPTION\System\CentralProcessor\0
SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall

5/22

The fingerprinting is gathered and saved at the beginning of the file informations.txt exfiltrated
to the C2 at a later stage during the infection process.
RisePro retrieves the infected host public IP address with a fallback functionality. It attempts to
get this information from ipinfo.io fails, it tries on api.db-ip.com. Should this also fail, a last
option is to contact maxmind.com which is a service for IP address geolocalisation.
The stealer also takes a screenshot of the infected host.

5. Analysis of the screenshot functionality
If the screenshot is saved in the working directory of the malware as screenshot.png, the file
will also be exfiltrated by the malware in the ZIP file.

Stolen Information
The stealer targets cookies, saved passwords, saved credit cards and crypto wallets and also
installed softwares for credentials.

The stealer also looks for particular file patterns, for example receipt with credit card
information in common folders (for instance, Desktop, Download, %TEMP%).
As previously introduced, stolen data are copied to the working directory of the malware to be
compressed in a ZIP file, exfiltrated during the late HTTP message.

Figure 7. Summary of RisePro HTTP communication with its C2
While RisePro communicates over HTTP in JSON format, the exchanged messages are
obfuscated, with bytes substitution and a XOR operation.

This obfuscation is interesting because it uses the same byte substitution tables as
PrivateLoader. The only difference is the value of the XOR key, PrivateLoader uses the value
0x9d and RisePro uses 0x36. The similarity between these two malwares is detailed in the
dedicated section (c.f:. Similiarities)

Loader capability
It is likely that RisePro is able to load and execute a next stage, whose configuration is
dynamically set by C2 communication on the /get_loader.php endpoint. This endpoint
provides the next payload to execute. As none of the RisePro samples analysed by
SEKOIA.IO downloaded a next stage payload or used this functionality, we assess this feature
is still under development.

next stage execution using ShellExecute function from shell32.dll
In case RisePro is configured with a next stage, the PE will be written in the same malware
working directory.

Similarities
Code & functionalities
During our investigation, we observed PrivateLoader and RisePro Stealer’s behaviours
partially overlap. Here is a list of specific functionalities shared by the two malware:
Strings obfuscation technique: (xor operation on 128 bits (representing integer data),
pxor) with the same key for a set of functionalities;
HTTP method and port setup;
HTTP message obfuscated with the same mode (byte substitution with same
replacement values followed by a XOR operation);
The similarity spotted between these two malware is buttressed by the output of Bindiff, which
shows more than 30% of code similarity.

Infrastructure
Starting from PrivateLoader wfsdragon.]ru domain, it is possible to pivot on the nameserver of
the domain (which is hosted on cloudflare) which return a long list of domain distributing
PrivateLoader samples (cf.: Annexe: IoCs – Shared domains based on NS) and three
domains related to RisePro:
m-rise.]pro
my-rise.]pro
myrise.]pro
PS: The previous query can be improved by a_record:104.21.0.0./16 to filter domains related
to RisePro and PrivateLoader on the same NS`
From the list of domains returned by the first query, a new part PL infrastructure could be
highlighted by searching domains on this AS containing ‘files‘.
Another query used to increase visibility into PrivateLoader infrastructure is to search for
URLs with the parameter ‘zip?c=‘ which translates into the following query: ‘entity:url url:”.zip?
c=”‘ hostname:file’. Moreover, since early December, the threat actors expanded their
infrastructure to include a new pattern for its delivery domain, which can be retrieved with the
following query: ‘entity:url url:”.zip?c=” hostname:soft‘.
NB: A majority of the domains with the ‘file’ pattern where used during October and November
but are down by now.

11/22

Besides, the two domains extracted from RisePro samples:
gamefilescript.]com
neo-files.]com
SEKOIA.IO analysts pivot on the whois record with the following virus total query:
‘entity:domain ( whois:be03d85074711f86 OR whois:b4208f2c291398c5 )‘ yielding a long list
of domain that again contains ‘file‘. (cf.: Annexe: IoCs – Domains share same whois)
While browsing the domains, it appears there are download link managers, the final payload
are password protected archives hosted on compromised WordPress. As shown by figure 10,
websites are only used to provide instructions (Download URL and archive password).

Figure 10. Example of a distribution website.
The redirect URL to download the malware changed regularly, at least once a day. Most of the
distribution domains are now down or for sale, which highlights the volatility of their
infrastructure.

12/22

The payload available for download on compromised WordPress is PrivateLoader that installs
a package of information stealer (RedLine, MixLoader, Vidar, etc…) for instance: Tria.ge :
2507f7ca248884372a3088bf6413bd8292f898ca.

Accesses & Support – Contacts
RisePro is available for sale on the Telegram account of the developper:
hxxps://t.]me/RiseProSUPPORT which is an obfuscated string embedded in the PE. There is
also a Telegram channel to interact with infected hosts: hxxps://t.]me/RisePro (name: Rise
bot). To interact with the host, attackers must provide the bot ID defined by the bot itself, and
sent to the C2 during the infection c.f.: Table 1, endpoint: /set_file.php response.
Threat Actors have access to the stolen data on the administration panel hosted at:
hxxps://my-rise.]cc. To create an account the provided email address must be trusted by the
solution. The domain my-rise.cc serves as a front end, and all requests are sent to the
subdomain api.my-rise.]cc.

Conclusion
SEKOIA.IO analysts understanding of the threat is that PrivateLoader is still active and
comes with a set of new capabilities. Similarities between the stealer and PrivateLoader
could not be ignored and provides additional insight into the threat actor expansion.
SEKOIA.IO analysts first hypothesis is that RisePro Stealer might be a simple PrivateLoader
version with pre-configured build to download its own stealer (NB: Side note, this version
does not use a Dead Drop Resolver technique). A second hypothesis is that PrivateLoader
simply evolved and a different unidentified PPI vendor provides RisePro installation via
PrivateLoader. At the time of writing, it is not clear whether RisePro is authored by
PrivateLoader developers. Another intelligence gap is whether RisePro is offered by the same
PPI service as PrivateLoader, or whether PrivateLoader authors maintain links with RisePro
authors. SEKOIA.IO analysts will keep tracking this threat to gain more knowledge into this
specific question, and welcome any input that could help us to fill the gap. SEKOIA.IO will
keep tracking this threat to provide as much as possible information to this question.
