Anomali Sr. Director of Cyber Intelligence Strategy A.J. Nash recently penned a column for
United States Cybersecurity Magazine about how changing security challenges call for new
skillsets and leadership professionals, who can help to develop ad run new programs that
keep pace with modern adversaries. In “Rise of the Chief Intelligence Officer (CINO),” A.J.
makes a case for why this position is needed and what such a leader’s skill set and
experience should include. It is republished here in its entirety and with full permission.
In response to growing threats in cyberspace, private sector organizations began creating
Intelligence programs nearly a decade ago, usually referred to as Cyber Threat Intelligence
(CTI). In theory, the private sector was attempting to replicate what the government has
successfully done for generations: gain informational advantage to prevent enemy victories
and mitigate damage from enemy successes. While most large enterprises today have
some sort of a CTI program, the majority are using the word “intelligence” without the
tradecraft, standards, or processes to support the label. “Intelligence” in the private sector is
still primarily tactical and technical cybersecurity led by people with backgrounds to match.
Best practices for collection, production, and dissemination of intelligence are rarely known
by those charged with the responsibilities of an intelligence organization. Moreover, only a
handful of companies have integrated intelligence into enterprise-wide processes for
optimization of outputs that meet documented organizational goals and objectives. Instead
of being intelligence-driven security practices, much of the private sector remains

underinvested and underprepared. Worse yet, most organizations with CTI programs, even
effective ones, restrict their own ability to capitalize on the time and money invested in CTI
because their vision for Intelligence is limited to the Security Operations Center (SOC).
The root cause for these challenges is a fundamental misunderstanding of intelligence,
borne out of ignorance for the differences between Cybersecurity and Intelligence as
independent career fields. Instead of being focused on Indicators Of Compromise (IOCs),
signatures, and response actions, Intelligence should be a means of countering threats,
cybersecurity or otherwise, and driving enterprise-wide improvements in risk reduction.
The answer to this challenge is to capitalize on the lessons learned by the U.S. Government
(USG) regarding Intelligence. Just as there is a Director of National Intelligence (DNI) who
reports directly to the President and leads the U.S. Intelligence Community “in intelligence
integration, forging a community that delivers the most insightful intelligence possible,”[1]
private sector enterprises each need a single Intelligence leader reporting directly to the
CEO, President, or Board of Directors. Instead of the sole intelligence function of a
company being a CTI team buried inside the SOC and focused on defensive cyber
operations or the needs of the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), establishment of
the Chief Intelligence Officer (CINO) will enable companies to maximize the value of their
investments, eliminate redundancies, and reduce risk.
In the 1980’s, as C-suites expanded to include Chief Information Officers (CIO),and in the
2010’s, to include Chief Security Officers (CSO) and Chief Human Resources Officers
(CHRO), it is time to open a new seat at the table for the first Chief Intelligence Officer
(CINO).

The Ideal CINO Candidate
When adding a chair in the boardroom, it is important to assess what unique value the new
addition will bring to the Executive Staff (E-Staff). The skills and experiences needed for the
newly minted CINO start with a deep knowledge of traditional intelligence standards and
practices as well as impeccable integrity and judgement. This will be the senior expert on
Intelligence and an influential voice informing the E-Staff and the Board; sometimes
influencing trajectory-changing corporate decisions. Beyond that, a successful CINO will
need a strong understanding of cybersecurity standards and practices, as well as familiarity
with physical security concepts, a background in risk assessment and reduction, a mindset
for business priorities, a process-driven approach, emotional intelligence to build
relationships across business lines and partnerships, and a strategic outlook.
While locating someone with all (or even most) of those skills will not be easy, the impact of
the role warrants finding or growing someone capable of demonstrating all these
characteristics. The most qualified candidates will be Intelligence leaders in the private
sector who transitioned from the government, as they will have Intelligence tradecraft
expertise and understand what drives private enterprise.

Relationship Between the CINO and Executive Counterparts
A typical E-Staff consists of (see Figure 1) the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief
Financial Officer (CFO) Chief Operations Officer (COO), Chief Information Officer (CIO),
Chief Customer Officer (CCO), Chief Marketing Officer (CMO), Chief Product Officer (CPO),
Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO), and Chief Security Officer (CSO). Subordinate to
the CSO is usually the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), although that role is
sometimes merged with either the CSO or CIO roles.

Figure 1: Relationship between the CINO & Executive Counterparts
The CINO, like the rest of the E-Staff, will be equal to all except the CEO to whom all others
report. If the CISO is subordinate to a CSO or CIO, it is the CSO or CIO who is the CINO’s
peer; not the CISO. It is important to note that, as Intelligence is a service and not a
product, the CINO will view their peers as customers; therefore, will only take direction from
the CEO. Other roles that may or may not exist include Chief Customer Officer (CCO),
Chief Risk Officer (CRIO), and Chief Legal Officer (CLO) for those with inside counsel.”

Role and Responsibilities of the CINO
Serving as the authority on Intelligence, the CINO will have five main responsibilities to the
enterprise. They are as follows:

3/8

Establishment, Enforcement, and Socialization of Intelligence Standards and
Tradecraft: The CINO will be responsible for establishing and enforcing analytic
standards and tradecraft based on established best practices. These will include
adopting Intelligence Community Directives (ICDs) 203,[2] 206,[3] and 208,[4]
structured analytic techniques,[5] the Traffic Light Protocol,[6] and the use of
frameworks such as MITRE ATT&CK,[7] Cyber Kill Chain,[8] The Diamond Model of
Intrusion Analysis,[9] National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
Cybersecurity Framework,[10] and Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR).[11]
Furthermore, as Intelligence is only effective if the receiving parties understand the
messages delivered from the Intelligence team, the CINO will be responsible for
training on the language of intelligence, including confidence language, caveats, and
source validation.
Creation and Maintenance of Intelligence Requirements: The CINO will be
responsible for research and analysis of existing operations, processes, goals,
objectives, systems, and personnel for the purpose of authoring, validating, and
maintaining Enterprise Intelligence Requirements (EIR) that reflect the strategic needs
of the business. Furthermore, the CINO will develop and maintain Subordinate
Intelligence Requirements (SIR) for individual entities across the enterprise. Finally,
the CINO must map all SIRs to established EIRs to eliminate the tendency to expend
energy on wasteful efforts against interesting but valueless intelligence projects
(known as “shiny objects”).

Delivery of a Unified Intelligence Picture: The CINO will be responsible for the
entire Intelligence Cycle, (Figure 2) with the output being the delivery of Intelligence
that creates informational advantages, drives proactive organizational changes, and
reduces risk across physical security (including facilities, personnel, and executive
protection), cybersecurity (offensive and defensive), insider threat, Governance, Risk
and Compliance (GRC), Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A),brand protection, and crisis
communications. Beyond delivering intelligence to each of these customer
organizations, the CINO will be in the unique position to synthesize intelligence
responding to EIRs and SIRs. What’s more, the CINO will be making connections that
today’s enterprises are unable to see due to duplication of efforts, stove piping,
parochialism, political rivalries, and individuals who prioritize personal career
objectives over the needs of the enterprise.

Proactive Intelligence: The CINO will be responsible for delivering assessments and
estimates regarding threats and risks, including probabilities and recommended
courses of action for proactive or reactive responses, to executive leaders and peers.
This intelligence can include both actionable intelligence (meant to inform or drive
immediate or near-term decisions) and informational intelligence (meant to educate on
patterns, trends, or understanding needed to grow an overall body of knowledge that
can serve as the foundation for later actionable intelligence production).
Response Intelligence: The CINO will be responsible for supporting ad-hoc
operations within any supported function, to include, but not limited to, physical or
cybersecurity incident response, and insider threat investigation. The intelligence
produced in response to these security operations should seek to improve
understanding of the threats, risks, and recommended courses of action for
minimizing loss and protecting business interests.

Benefits of a Top-Down Approach to Intelligence
Elevating Intelligence and establishing an independent CINO who will report directly to the
CEO will yield some clear benefits over today’s more common model of CTI buried inside a
SOC. First, Intelligence will no longer be disproportionately influenced by the needs of one
organization at the expense of other organizations. Serving under the CEO will empower
the CINO to objectively assess EIRs and SIRs; therefore, recommending prioritization
based on the strategic vision of the CEO without subordinate organizations or leaders
forcing Intelligence to prioritize their needs over all others. This ensures that an enterprise
will capitalize on the significant investment in talent, access, and technologies needed to
create an effective Intelligence program. Second, with Intelligence elevated and unified, the
CINO will be able to reduce redundancies in expenditures and effort that often plague large
enterprises today. For instance, many enterprises currently have multiple teams paying for
the same or similar intelligence from vendors. This is often caused by one of the following
factors:
Inefficient or bypassed procurement processes
Ignorance among teams of the roles and responsibilities of their counterparts
Managers prioritizing personal objectives over the needs of the enterprise
Third, with Intelligence unified under the CINO, the enterprise will benefit from having a
single authoritative source. In time-critical situations, including security, cybersecurity, and
business crises, competing opinions of varying validity based on inconsistent information
and judgement criteria lead to poorly informed decisions that can be catastrophic. The
CINO will act as a unifying agent across all available sources, serving as trusted and
reliable counsel to the CEO and E-Staff at the most critical times.

Visualizing the Future of Intelligence in Private Industry

Figure 4
Having established the role, responsibilities, and benefits of expanding the E-Staff to
include the CINO, the remaining question is who will report to the CINO and how that will
change existing organizations. This is likely the easiest adjustment to make, as most
organizations are mature enough to move to the CINO concept, and already have
established effective CTI programs. Transitioning from CTI within a SOC to Intelligence
under a CINO is just a matter of elevating the current team and expanding their mandate to
match the program described previously. Figure 3 and 4 (see above) offers a visualization
of these current and future states of Intelligence.
