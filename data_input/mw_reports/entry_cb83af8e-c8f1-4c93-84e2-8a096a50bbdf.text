About This Paper

Introduction

This paper exposes a targeted attack called “HeartBeat,”
which has been persistently pursuing the South Korean
government and related organizations since 2009. This
paper will discuss how their specifically crafted campaigns
infiltrate their targets.

Today’s cybercriminals try to infect as many users as
possible. Their goal is simple—to monetize the resources or
data from infected machines in any way they can. Behind
such attacks are highly covert targeted campaigns known
as APTs.

Compared to most advanced persistent threat (APT)
campaigns with diverse targeted industries, the HeartBeat
campaign is an isolated case. Furthermore, we will examine
their attack methodologies which include their attack
vector, the remote administration tool (RAT) component,
and command-and-control servers. Finally, we will discuss
how this information can be useful in developing defensive
strategies in protecting organizations as well as predicting
future targets.

While targeted campaigns continue to increase, research
efforts by the security industry reveal that some of these
attacks have existed for several years.1 Depending on the
motive, APT campaigns may attack various industries,
organizations or communities from different regions and
countries. For instance, the Luckycat campaign targeted
the aerospace, energy, engineering, shipping, and military
research industries in India and Japan.2 Additionally,
they targeted the Tibetan activists’ community. The
IXESHE campaign, on the other hand, targeted East Asian
governments, Taiwanese electronics manufacturers,
and a telecommunications company.3 While most of
these campaigns have multiple targets, smaller, more
subtle campaigns with exceedingly specific targets are
also present. The Taidoor campaign is an example of
this, where all of the compromise victims were from
Taiwan, and the majority of which were government
organizations.4
This research paper will delve into a targeted campaign
that targets organizations and communities within South
Korea. We call this malicious operation the “HeartBeat
campaign.”

Campaign Targets

Context

The HeartBeat campaign appears to target government
organizations and institutions or communities that are
in some way related to the South Korean government.
Specifically, we were able to identify the following targets:

The first HeartBeat campaign remote access tool (RAT)5
component was discovered in June 2012 in a Korean
newspaper company network. Further investigation
revealed that the campaign has been actively distributing
their RAT component to their targets in 2011 and the first
half of 2012. Furthermore, we uncovered one malware
component that dates back to November 2009. This
indicates that the campaign started during that time or
earlier.

• Political parties
• Media outfits
• A national policy research institute
• A military branch of South Korean armed forces

Earlier versions of the HeartBeat campaign’s RAT
component contained the following strings in their codes:

• A small business sector organization

Thus, the campaign name “HeartBeat.”

• Branches of South Korean government
The profile of their targets suggests that the motive
behind the campaign may be politically motivated.

PAGE 2 | THE HEARTBEAT APT CAMPAIGN

Attack Vector
In order to gain control over targets systems, HeartBeat
perpetrators install a RAT in prospective victims’ systems.
This RAT arrives as a disguised or fake document which
is actually a bundled file. The bundled file contains both
a decoy document and the RAT installer that has been
packaged together using a binder tool. Once it runs, the
decoy document is displayed to the user while the RAT
unknowingly executes in the background.

Based on the samples we collected, the campaign’s decoy
documents used the file formats .JPG, .PDF, XLS, and HWP,
the Korean government standard word processor format.
One of the previous HeartBeat attacks even dropped a
pornographic .JPG image as decoy. Below is a screenshot
of a Hangul Word Processor (.HWP) document used as bait
in November 2011. Its document title roughly translates to
“Information to the President.hwp.”

It is unclear how these packaged files specifically arrive on
victims’ systems, but we highly suspect that spearphishing
emails6 containing these packaged malware were primarily
used to distribute them. In fact, the packaged malware
used the icon of the decoy document in order to look
legitimate. For instance, if the decoy is an XLS file, the
package will appear to have an XLS document icon. In
addition, some of the decoy files required passwords in
order to be viewed.
Figure 3. A decoy .HWP document

Figure 2. Example of a decoy Adobe Reader document

The previously mentioned techniques are commonly used
in spearphishing attacks where prospective victims are
lured to open a seemingly benign document attachment.
In order to appear more legitimate, some of these emails
contain password protected documents. A password is
then provided in the email body as a social engineering
technique.

PAGE 3 | THE HEARTBEAT APT CAMPAIGN

Infection Flow
Once users open the packaged malicious file, the actual document is displayed to the user while a RAT installer in
.EXE format runs in the background. The RAT installer, on the other hand, drops a .DLL file that is then injected to the
legitimate process svchost.exe. The injected code in svchost.exe then connects to the malware command and control
(C&C) server to register infection and wait for remote commands.

The RAT Component
Backdoor Functionalities

The RAT installer in turn drops a .DLL component which
contains the backdoor capabilities. In order to stay hidden,
the .DLL uses file names similar to legitimate applications.
Below is a list of file names used:
• %Program Files%\Common Files\Services\6to4nt.dll

The HeartBeat campaign’s RAT component allows
attackers to remotely execute the following commands on
affected hosts:

• %Program Files%\Common Files\System\6to4nt.dll

• List running processes and their respective process
IDs

• %Program Files%\Windows NT\htrn.dll

• Download and execute file(s)
• Update itself
• Uninstall itself
• Create or terminate a process
• List available removable and fixed drives

• %Program Files%\Windows NT\Accessories\6to4nt.dll

• %Program Files%\Windows NT\htrn_jls.dll
• %Program Files%\Windows NT\hyper.dll
• %System%\Network Remote.dll
• %System%\SvcHost.dll
Some these dropped .DLL files use fake file properties
in order to not appear suspicious. The following is an
example:

• List existing files and their creation date/time
• Upload file(s)
• Delete file(s)
• Get the file creation date/time of a specific file
• Open a remote command shell access
• Reboot the system
These commands give the attackers complete control over
their victims’ systems. Attackers also have the option to
uninstall the RAT any time to cover their tracks and avoid
being discovered.

Installation and Persistence
The RAT installer is initially dropped and executed by the
packaged file using any of the following file names:
• %System%\msrt.exe
• %Program Files%\Common Files\AcroRd32.exe
• %Program Files%\Common Files\config.exe

Figure 5. A.DLL that uses fake file properties

• %Program Files%\Common Files\explorer.exe
PAGE 5 | THE HEARTBEAT APT CAMPAIGN

In some cases, the RAT installer drops 2 .DLL files where
one of the .DLLs serves as a loader of the other .DLL file
which contains the backdoor payload.
The .DLL component is then registered as a service
through the following added registries:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\
Services\{service name}
Type = “20”
Start = “2”
ErrorControl = “1”
ImagePath = “%SystemRoot%\System32\svchost.exe
-k netsvcs”
ObjectName = “LocalSystem”
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\
Services\{service name}\Parameters
ServiceDll = C:\Program Files\Windows NT\htrn.
dll
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\
Services\{service name}\Security
Security = {values}
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\
Services\{service name}\Enum
0 = “Root\LEGACY_{service name}\0000”
Count = “1”
NextInstance = “1”
*{service name} may be “6to4”, “Ias” or
“Irmon”.

C&C Communication
Once the RAT’s .DLL component has been injected to
svchost.exe, the malware attempts to register itself to the
C&C server by sending the following information from the
affected system:
• Computer name
• Local IP address
• Service pack
These data are sent along with a campaign code and the
string “qawsed”. While the “qawsed” string is not present
in earlier versions of their RAT, we suspect that the
attackers only recently added this as a default campaign
password.
The RAT’s C&C communication is encrypted with XOR
encryption using a single byte key, 02H. Furthermore, the
data being transferred and received by the RAT C&C are
800H (2,048 bytes) in size.

The service is then invoked once installed. This results
in the .DLL being injected to svchost.exe process. This
registry modification allows the RAT to execute upon every
system startup.
After installation the RAT installer deletes itself, which
leaves only the disguised .DLL and related registry entries
on the affected system.
Note that the presence of any of the files or registries
above may be an indication of a possible HeartBeat
infection in a system.

Figure 6. RAT’s encryption algorithm before sending data to its
C&C server

PAGE 6 | THE HEARTBEAT APT CAMPAIGN

Figure 7. RAT’s decryption code upon receiving data from the C&C server

During the RAT’s phone home, the following TCP traffic is observed on the network:

When decrypted, the above traffic looks as follows:

The majority of the RAT variants used port 80. Recent
variants, however, were observed to use port 443. Other
ports we have seen being utilized are port 5600 and port
8080.

Earlier RAT variants did not use encryption on their C&C
communication. Moreover, they only sent the computer
name and campaign code during phone home. Below is a
screenshot of the unencrypted C&C communication.

PAGE 7 | THE HEARTBEAT APT CAMPAIGN

The C&C traffic size also varied in previous versions. Some
early variants used traffic that are 28H (40 bytes) and
1004H (4,100 bytes) in size.
Additionally, the port, C&C address, campaign code and
password are hardcoded in the RAT’s malware body
in plain text. In some RAT versions, however, they are
encrypted and are decrypted only during run-time,
possibly to protect the RAT from static analysis by security
researchers.
These variations in their RAT component indicate that it
has since been undergoing development.

Command and Control

HeartBeat Campaign Codes and Decoy
Documents
The campaign codes and decoy documents used by the
HeartBeat attackers provided valuable insights on their
campaigns. In fact, majority of their campaign codes
included number combinations which represented the
month and date in MMDD format when the attack attempt
was executed. The rest of the campaign code string
often describes the decoy document that was used in a
specific campaign. For instance, a campaign code from
October 2011 is “army-1022” where attackers used a decoy
document containing military-related information.
Campaign code

The HeartBeat campaign’s C&C domains appear to utilize
a site redirection service. Their C&C sites redirect to IP
addresses from ISPs in Armenia, USA, Japan, India and
Korea. We observed that they updated the IP address
of some of their C&C domains. Likewise, all of their IP
addresses belong to legitimate ISPs. Considering this,
we suspect that these IP addresses are compromised
hosts that act as proxy servers which redirects traffic to
the actual C&C servers. Again, this adds another layer of
anonymity to the HeartBeat perpetrators.

Table 2. Campaign codes used

On the other hand, decoy documents’ contents were
also very specific to their targets. For example, some of
these documents included logos of specific groups. This
information helped us identify their targeted organizations
and communities in their previous campaigns.

PAGE 9 | THE HEARTBEAT APT CAMPAIGN

Figure 7. Relationships between HeartBeat attack components

Relationships among C&C Domains, IPs, and Campaigns

Attribution
Clues relating to the attackers remain very limited. Using
compromised hosts as C&C proxy servers minimizes the
possibility of tracking potential threat actors. While a
number of their campaign codes included Chinese words
such as guohui, xuehui and minzhu, they appear to be
comfortable using the English language. Some of the C&C
domain names even contained English words. In addition,
the binder tool and the RAT component are written
in English. For instance, some text from the packaged
components’ body included “Select Files!” and “Bind
Success!”, while the RAT component included strings
such as “Uninstall…ok” and the name of the RAT itself,
“HeartBeat.”
Threat actors and entities that use collected information
from targets may be two separate parties that are only
related in a professional and malicious manner. In this
case, determining the latter may be impossible. Likewise,
it is very difficult to identify the threat actors behind
the HeartBeat campaign given the limited amount of
information available.

Conclusion
The Heartbeat campaign has been successfully executing
targeted attacks since 2009. In order for attackers to
properly track their campaigns and victims, they used
campaign codes that contained the campaign dates and
strings that described specific campaigns. These campaign
codes are embedded in their RAT binaries and were sent
to their C&C servers along with information regarding the
targets’ system. Additionally, they used a commercial site
redirection service for their C&C domains. These domains
redirected to various IP addresses that belonged to
legitimate ISPs, which may be compromised hosts that act
as proxy servers. This effectively hides the real location of
the attackers behind HeartBeat. While having an isolated
target may have helped them stay under the security
industry’s radar, the attackers illustrated that they were
very careful but persistent.

Understanding targeted campaigns and their
methodologies is fundamental in protecting both end
users and organizations. Not only does it help in coming
up with effective defensive strategies through multiple
protection layers, it also helps with predicting possible
targets in the future and ultimately, raise awareness. As
of this writing, the HeartBeat APT campaign remains an
active targeted campaign.

Timeline
We collected 19 set of samples related to HeartBeat
campaign from November 2009 to June 2012. This
translates to 19 campaigns where the vast majority
of which were distributed between 2011 and 2012.
Nonetheless, the limited number of samples we were
able to obtain still means that the campaign is indeed
persistent. The isolated nature of this targeted attack
and its small user base may only require the HeartBeat
perpetrators to carry out minimal campaigns in order to
infiltrate their targets.

We did not obtain a campaign sample from 2010. However,
we highly suspect that their operation was also active
during that year. In fact, we can see in the second MD5
above that the sample was compiled in December 24, 2010.
Also, it is possible that some of the campaign’s attacks
may not have been escalated to antivirus firms by infected
users, or simply remains undiscovered.

that contain file attachments using extensions such as
.VBS, .BAT, .EXE, .PIF and .SCR files.
• Avoid opening email attachments and clicking
embedded links from unknown sources
• Block any file with more than one file type extension.

Defending against the HeartBeat
Campaign

• When a computer is compromised, isolate it
immediately from the network.

Essential components of defense against the HeartBeat
campaign are security-related policies within enterprises.
Once an attack is identified, a good cleanup strategy
should focus on determining the attack vector and cutting
off communications with the C&C server. It is also vital to
determine the scope of the compromise and assessing the
damage through data analysis and forensics.

• Don’t save login credentials on the local computer.

• Configure your system to show hidden files and folders
and display file extensions.

The following best practices are also advised:
• Disable services that are related to the HeartBeat RAT
component.
• Enable system’s firewall
• Keep software and operating systems updated
with latest patches released by vendors to address
vulnerabilities and exploits.
• Block unused ports to disallow malware from
using these ports to communicate and/or enforce
commands.
• Monitor network connections for any suspicious
connection or connectivity.
• Regularly update list of sites that are trusted.
• Configure your email server to block or remove email

PAGE 12 | THE HEARTBEAT APT CAMPAIGN

December 2012 | APT Campaign Quick Profile: HEARTBEAT
Advanced persistent threats (APTs) refer to a category of threats that aggressively pursue and compromise specific
targets to maintain persistent presence within the victim’s network so they can move laterally and exfiltrate data.
Unlike indiscriminate cybercrime attacks, spam, web threats, and the like, APTs are much harder to detect because
of the targeted nature of related components and techniques. Also, while cybercrime focuses on stealing credit card
and banking information to gain profit, APTs are better thought of as cyber espionage.

HEARTBEAT
• First Seen
Individual targeted attacks are not one-off attempts. Attackers continually try to get inside the target’s network.
The “HeartBeat” campaign has been persistently pursuing government agencies since 2009. The samples collected related to this campaign covered
attacks seen from November 2009 to June 2012, although majority of the attacks were seen in 2011 and 2012.

• Victims and Targets
APT campaigns target specific industries or communities of interest in specific regions.
The HeartBeat campaign targets South Korean government organizations and institutions like political parties, media outfits, a national policy
research institute, a military branch of South Korean armed forces, a small business sector organization, and branches of the South Korean
government.

• Operations
The 1st-stage computer intrusions often use social engineering. Attackers custom-fit attacks to their targets.
The threat actors behind HeartBeat install a RAT in system. The RAT arrives as a disguised or fake document which is actually a bundled file. The
bundled file contains both a decoy document and the RAT installer that has been packaged together using a binder tool. The campaign’s decoy
documents used the file formats .JPG, .PDF, XLS, and HWP, the Korean government standard word processor format.

• Possible Indicators of Compromise
Attackers want to remain undetected as long as possible. A key characteristic of these attacks is stealth.
The following indicators suggest an infection by the HeartBeat campaign: contiguous 02H bytes communication in the network, the presence of
certain files and registries as detailed in the paper, and network connections to certain IPs and domains, including the presence of files detected as
TROJ_DRPBEAT and BKDR_HBEAT.

• Relationship with other APT Campaigns
This attack does not seem to have any relationship with other APT campaigns.
