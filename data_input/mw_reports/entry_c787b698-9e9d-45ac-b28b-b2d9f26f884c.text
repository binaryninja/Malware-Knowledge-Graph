Table 1. Relationship between original binary and three discovered variants. (Use the scrollbar to view the content on the far right.)
As you can see from Table 1 above, these files exhibit many similar characteristics and behaviors. Most of the differences appear to be
cosmetic and do not affect the underlying functionality. Our analysts took a closer look at the C2 domain poison-frog[.]club, which is used in 3
of the 4 files, and found that it overlaps with the findings of the FireEye report. The domain resolved to 82.102.14.219 from at least August
2017 until December 2017. Additional domains that resolved to that IP during that time frame are dns-update[.]club, hpserver[.]online, and
anyportals[.]com which were all mentioned in the FireEye report. The other C2 domain used, proxycheker[.]pro, resolved to 94.23.172.164 and
185.15.247.147, with 185.15.247.147 also hosting dns-update[.]club during that time frame. This new-found evidence, in combination with
similar versions of POWRUNER and BONDUPDATER, the existence of the same debug strings in the code of each variant, and the
overlapping infrastructure indicate that these three new binaries are also associated with APT34 operations.
The DGA domain generation algorithm used in one version of the BONDUPDATER backdoor is broken down into two parts: send and receive.
If data is being sent, then the following format is used:

1. This is created from combining a unique ID (generated from the MAC address or encoded version of whoami) along with two other
parameters which are inserted at two different random offsets in the unique ID
2. Random characters generated from: -join ((48 .. 57)+(65 .. 70) | Get-Random -Count (%{ Get-Random -InputObject (1 .. 7) }) | %{
[char]$_ })
3. Hardcoded "A"
4. Two random offset values referenced in #1.
5. Hardcoded "7"
6. Data Chunk being sent
7. Encoded Filename being sent
8. Hardcoded domain ".poison-frog[.]club"
If data is being received, then the following format is used:

The Domain Generating Algorithm (DGA) generation process is different than what was previously mentioned in the FireEye report. However,
it would still be detected using DarkLabs' custom DGA detection mechanism.
In early January 2018, ClearSky Cyber Security tweeted about two new malware samples attributed to Oilrig/APT34. These samples were
being deployed via a malicious .chm (Compiled HTML Help File) file. ClearSky provides a link to a Google document they use for "Raw Threat
Intelligence" which contained additional IOCs associated with this campaign. Two hashes provided in that document are for versions of
POWRUNER (MD5: BED81E58EF8FF0B073E371D433A08855) and BONDUPDATER (MD5: 63D6B1933F7330358A8FBFAF77532133).
These two backdoors contain a reference to another C2 domain, www.window5[.]win. Using the custom tool developed in DarkLabs, we were
able to pivot from these samples and discover an additional sample each of POWRUNER and BONDUPDATER.
These two new samples exhibit similar behavior to the samples mentioned in the FireEye report. However, there are a few slight differences namely the use of a new C2 domain and URI, www.window5[.]win/update.aspx. At writing time of this post, that domain resolves to
185.181.8.246. Current research indicates that IP does not host any other domains publicly available. Additionally, the %PUBLIC%\Java
location (e.g. C:\Users\Public\Java) is used for a staging directory in this version of POWRUNER.

By diving deeper and pivoting on known indicators using techniques developed and honed by our experienced analysts, the indicator lifecycle
can diversify discovery. In this case, analysts discovered additional unreported, yet campaign associated IOCs that can be used for further
detection. Additionally, our analysts also developed YARA signatures for static detection, and TTP based signatures to deploy to EDR tools or
for hunting through endpoint telemetry data.
The Booz Allen DarkLabs Threat Hunt team recommends deploying detection to endpoints for the hashes listed above and perform a
retroactive search for the domains and IPs in SIEM logs. We also recommend the use of telemetry data collected via EDR tools to
continuously hunt for this behavior. Monitoring for the behavior or TTP is a critical step because although IOCs can be used for detection and
discovery, they can in many cases be changed cheaply and easily. Our advanced Threat Hunt team always recommends a robust proactive
approach to threat hunting with a focus on behavioral detection.
