Overview
On Saturday January 15th, Microsoft released a blog titled “Destructive malware targeting
Ukrainian organizations”. Microsoft’s blog outlines an ongoing attack against organisations in
Ukraine by a currently-unknown threat actor and provides a detailed analysis of the malware
samples involved. We have provided additional resources below that may be of use to those
responding or investigating the attacks.
We have shared copies of the malware samples, decompiled code and YARA rules on our Github:

Malware Analysis References
In summary, the malware deployed in this campaign blocks access to computing systems by
corrupting the Master Boot Record (MBR) section of the hard drive. The MBR is overwritten with a
ransom note, such as those commonly seen in ransomware attacks, preventing the machine from
booting and resulting in the corruption of files stored on the filesystem. However, as Microsoft
notes, there is no recovery mechanism for the corrupted MBR, suggesting the ransom note is fake.
This means the malware is likely masquerading as ransomware to hide its true capabilities or foil
attribution attempts.

The “ransom note” displayed
Given the geopolitical climate in Ukraine, this attack has attracted interest from the cybersecurity
research community. We’ve referenced additional analyses below:
