adversary

Mofang (模仿, Mófa ̌ng, to imitate) is a threat actor that
almost certainly operates out of China and is probably
government-affiliated. It is highly likely that Mofang’s targets
are selected based on involvement with investments, or
technological advances that could be perceived as a threat
to the Chinese sphere of influence. This is most clearly the
case in a campaign focusing on government and critical
infrastructure of Myanmar that is described in this report.
Chances are about even, though, that Mofang is a relevant
threat actor to any organization that invests in Myanmar or is
otherwise politically involved. In addition to the campaign in
Myanmar, Mofang has been observed to attack targets
across multiple sectors (government, military, critical
infrastructure and the automotive and weapon industries) in
multiple countries.
The following countries have, in the above named sectors, been affected, although Fox-IT
suspects there to be more: India, Germany, United States, Canada, Singapore, South Korea.

Despite its diverse set of targets Mofang is probably one group. This is based on the fact that
its tools (ShimRat and ShimRatReporter) are not widely used, and that campaigns are not
usually observed in parallel. Technically, the group uses distinct tools that date back to at
least February 2012: ShimRat and ShimRatReporter. The mofang group does not use
exploits to infect targets, they rely on social engineering and their attacks are carried out in
three stages:
1. Compromise for reconnaissance, aiming to extract key information about the target
infrastructure.
2. Faux infrastructure setup, designed to avoid attracting attention.
3. The main compromise, to carry out actions on the objective.
The name ShimRat is based on how its persistence is build up. It uses the so-called shims in
Windows to become persistent. Shims are simply hot patching processes on the fly, to
ensure backward compatibility of software on the Microsoft Windows platform.
As far as known, the only exploits the Mofang group uses are privilege elevation exploits built
into their own malware. The vulnerabilities that were being exploited were already known
about at the time of use. The full report contains contextual as well as technical information
about the group and its activities. These can be used, for example, for threat assessments,
compromise assessments, incident response and forensics activities.
