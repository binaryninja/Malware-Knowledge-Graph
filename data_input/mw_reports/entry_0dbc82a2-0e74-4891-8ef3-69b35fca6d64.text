// Introduction
Lazarus (aka APT38 / Hidden Cobra / Stardust Chollima) is one of the more proliﬁc threat actors
in the APT panorama. Since 2009, the group leveraged its capability in order to target and
compromise a wide range of targets; Over the time, the main targets have been government and
defense institutions, organizations operating in the energy and petrochemical sector in addition to
those operating in ﬁnancial and banking one.
The group has also a wide range of tools at its disposal; among these, it’s possible to catalog [D]
DoS botnets, ﬁrst stage implanters, remote access tools (RATs), keyloggers and wipers. This list
of malicious tools has over time supported a series of operations that have ranged from
espionage to funding up sabotage.
This speciﬁc blog posts about concerns of a recent operation most likely carried out by this group
and directed towards targets located in different parts of the world. However, our analysis started
from a single malicious e-mail delivered against an important Italian institution operating in the
banking and ﬁnancial sector.

Starting from this email, we tried to trace back the path of the threat actor up to obtaining an
excellent degree of visibility on what was going on.
By tracking down malware variants, the actor’s operational logic and mechanisms were put in
place in order to limit the spread of the second-stage payloads.
However, in this intervention, we will describe only the ﬁrst phase of the kill chain; Here, the threat
actor has provided for the release of two types of payloads based on the architecture of the
victim’s system as well as actions used in order to carry out a ﬁrst recognition phase. Afterward,
some features of the remote script that was used for managing and controlling victims will be
explored. Further information about this campaign are available for our threat intelligence portal
customers by referring to the investigation ATR:78456.

// Vector
The threat actor, in this case, relied on a spoofed e-mail message (coming from
e_banking@victim_name_domain_name) in order to deliver to the victims a message with a
malicious Microsoft Ofﬁce Word document attached. One of these retrieved documents refers to
an alleged vacant job position for the Hindustan Aeronautics company.

The malicious document has two separate ﬁrst-stage doubly base64 encoded payloads included
within (one for 32 and one for 64-bit systems) in addition to another doubly encoded base64 word
document that has been shown to the user.
An example of one of the payloads is shown as follows:

Once the macro is executed, the ﬁrst infection process is started using the AutoOpen Sub.
Variables dllPath and docPath are ﬁlled calling respectively the functions GetDllName() and
GetDocName() in order to retrieve the paths from where they will be loaded later. For the ﬁrst
stage, it is as follows:
%USERPROFILE%”\AppData\Local\Microsoft\ThumbNail\thumnail.db
A subsequent LoadLibraryA loads dropped dll. A variable named “a” is then ﬁlled with the
results of the so-called ShowState function within the content of an active opened document.
These instructions are the result of executing the dropped library.

// First run and persistence
The ShowState function has mainly the task of recovering the current execution path, starting the
SetupWorkStation function in the same module context and ensuring persistence in the affected
system.
It is interesting to note how the functions CoInitialize and CoCreateIstance are used respectively
to initialize the COM library and to instantiate the COM object.

However, in order to understand which object is being instantiated, the ﬁrst argument to the
CoCreateInstance() function must be inspected to extract the unique identiﬁer (CLSID) of the
COM object. A look at variable as it would look in memory is shown as follows:

Opening the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOTCLSID key gives the corresponding readable format:

On function return, a new shortcut (lnk) is created under the local path resulting from
GetTempPath function minus “\Local\Temp\” and plus “\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start
Menu\Programs\Startup\thumbnail.lnk“

“C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe” “full path of module”, SetupWorkStation S-6-38-441276700627-315277-3247 0 0 9109 1

// Implant Initialization
SetupWorkStation function of the implant is aimed at a system reconnaissance and at
performing beacon of the command and control center. If the malware does not ﬁnd the exact
number of expected arguments in its command line, it simply quits the execution without going
any further.
Inside this frame of code, a new thread is created with the starting address 100075A0.
sub_10007340 is designed to initialize external communication. It internally calls sub_100071F0
that is aimed to executing operations designed for system reconnaissance.
An example of these instructions from dynamically generated pseudo-code is shown below:
Retrieving Username and CumputerName

Retrieving LogicalDrives, DriveTypes

Retrieving FreeSpace for drives

Performing Processes Enumeration

The collected information is then compressed and encrypted. Subsequent HTTP request is
prepared in order to send data to command and control. Communications make use of HTTP
protocol and POST method. “ned“, “gl” and “hl” parameters will be used in order to interact with
remote command and control script that are used to handle victims and to deliver the second
stage payload. A code frame regarding the functions used for HTTP communication is reported
as follows:

// Behind the ﬁrst stone
We had the opportunity to analyze what the actor did in the backend in order to manage the
victims of the ﬁrst stage implanter that has been described. The remote script, at least as far as
observed, is copied into legitimate compromised sites. It also includes the possibility to decide if
and when the second level payload is to be released and works through blacklists and whitelists
in order to protect the ﬁnal backdoor from unwanted spread.

It looks like a heavily obfuscated VBScript artifact. Here an extract from the original retrieved
code:

After retrieving the original instructions set, it has been possible to deeply understand the working
logic behind; The remote script works mainly through Request.Form variables that are ﬁlled
when receiving beacons from victims and by local variables named as following:
1. strworkdir: The working folder within the compromised wwwroot.
2. strlogpath: The path to the ﬁle used in order to log victims’ data. In this case a fake .mp3 ﬁle
3. strwhiteﬁle: The path to the ﬁle used in order to store whitelisted victims IP address. In this
case, a fake .mp3 ﬁle.
4. strblackﬁle: The path to the ﬁle used in order to store the blacklisted IP address. In this case,
a fake .mp3 ﬁle.
Parameters “gl” and “hl” are used respectively to retrieve system info about victims and OS
architecture. On the basis of what we have collected, the log ﬁle mapped by strlogpath variable
is then updated with a new row comprising victim IP address, victim system info, request
timestamp and adopted case in handling the victim.
The cases that have been designed by the threat actor can be four on the basis of interest for the
victim:
1. case_1_64/86: MD5 of IP address that made the request is on whitelist. The actor has
selected the victim to be infected with a second-stage payload. TorisMa_x64/86 payload is
then released to the victim.
2. case_2_64/86: MD5 of IP address that made the request is on blacklist. The actor wants to
prevent the spreading of the second stage payload to that IP address. Doris_x64/86 (nonsense chars) payload is then released to the victim.
3. case_3: The victim results of particular interest for the threat actor on the basis of retrieved
system info (identiﬁed with a value of 24 of “ned“). Second stage payload is not yet
delivered.
4. case_4: The victim results of no particular interest for the threat actor. no previous
condition has been met. Second stage payload is not yet delivered.

Below, the primary construct used to manage what is received by the backend script:

// Victimology
According to the visibility obtained so far, we asses with a high degree of conﬁdence that this
campaign is mainly directed against research/defense sector and ﬁnancial / payments institutions.
Other types of sectors are obviously not to be excluded on the basis of actor interests. Most of the
malicious activities associated with the examined malware set are limited to the Indian region.
However, organizations of other countries as well are inside of Lazarus’ interests. Here there is an
exhaustive geographical map where it is possible to observe actions attributable to this speciﬁc
threat (note that these malicious actions may not have led to a current active infection but could
be only limited to infection attempts):

// Conclusions
In this case, the Lazarus group targets research / defense and ﬁnancial organizations mainly in
the same region where the security community has recently attributed an attack from the same
group against a nuclear power plant. However, it has also been noted that the actor has extended
its interests to other regions of the world, including Italy. Furthermore, we have observed an info-

gathering implanter used to quickly identify interesting targets and we have exposed the use of a
backend script designed to handle the victims and limit the spread of second-stage payloads only
to wanted ones.

// MITRE ATT&CK Techniques
