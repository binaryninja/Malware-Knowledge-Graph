WHITEPAPER

As the threat landscape continues to evolve with a perpetual influx of new network anomalies
and Indicators of Compromise (IOC), prudent defenders must focus on more actionable elements
of attack characteristics, such as Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs). One such example
of this is the Initial Access Tactic.
An adversary uses Initial Access techniques to gain an initial foothold within a victim
environment.1 This is perhaps one of the most crucial tactics that adversaries use as part of an
intrusion, as most attacks (excluding those such as denial of service) are not successful without
first obtaining this access into the target environment. As such, defenders consider it a critical
dependency of all other tactics.
While some adversaries see initial access as the means to perform further actions on objectives,
a number of Dragos Activity Groups focus on developing and obtaining initial access against
industrial organizations. A prime example of this is PARISITE’s exploitation of known VPN
vulnerabilities in order to obtain initial access and enable further operations for the
MAGNALLIUM Activity Group. 2 Given this characteristic, eliminating (or reducing) initial
access vectors can prove to be a successful method of thwarting many intrusion attempts,
particularly when there is consistency in the underlying adversarial techniques.
This white paper steps through the most common initial access techniques Dragos observes
being utilized by activity groups in order to equip defenders with some of the vital elements
of threat behavior knowledge and thus address the associated risks.

Industrial Control Systems/Operational Technology (ICS/OT) organizations
should be well-versed in Initial Access Techniques for the following reasons:
•	Initial access is the pre-requisite to further stages of an attack and
therefore focusing on this tactic can aid in the prioritization of efforts
for defenders.
•	The rapidly changing nature of network anomalies and IOCs mandates
the focus on threat behaviors, such as the more slowly changing TTPs.
•	While direct access to an ICS/OT environment is considered the
code red of initial access scenarios, gaining access to a corporate/
IT network can act as a precursor to an ICS/OT pivot.
•	Numerous Dragos-tracked Activity Groups have been known to explicitly
target/develop initial access to industrial organization environments.

MITRE ATT&CK FOR ICS FRAMEWORK:
THE INITIAL ACCESS TACTIC
MITRE ATT&CK for ICS is a communitysourced framework for identifying malicious
threat behaviors, specifically the tactics and
techniques of the adversaries in industrial
control systems (ICS). 3 Dragos significantly
contributed to this community-supported
knowledgebase with findings from our
customers and insights from our services
and intelligence efforts. Dragos maps its
technology and services to MITRE ATT&CK
for ICS and is the first ICS vendor to fully
integrate MITRE ATT&CK for ICS into
its platform.
MITRE ATT&CK for ICS outlines twelve
individual techniques within the Initial Access
tactic, spanning from spearfishing to the
exploitation of public-facing applications.
While many of these techniques are shared
by the MITRE ATT&CK enterprise framework,
40 percent of the listed techniques are
exclusive to the ICS framework.
Every technique within this tactic ultimately
endeavors to achieve one primary objective:
gain access to the target environment.
However, the actual entry vectors differ
greatly between each of the techniques.
Additionally, while each technique can
exist in isolation, some may also be utilized
together to achieve initial access into the
target environments.

OBSERVED INITIAL ACCESS TECHNIQUES BY KNOWN
ACTIVITY GROUPS
The following are initial access techniques that Dragos has observed known Activity Groups using to
gain access into industrial organizations.

Spearphishing Attachment [T0865]
The Spearphishing attachment technique forms the most frequently observed Initial Access
technique amongst the Dragos-tracked Activity Groups – with at least 10 out of the 15 AGs utilizing
this technique.4 These ten groups are shown by their tokens below.

Spearphishing differs from conventional phishing in the way
that adversaries specifically target a victim, with the associated
email often containing tailored information to instill a false sense
of legitimacy. While other forms of spearphishing (such as those
facilitating credential access) may also eventually lead to initial
access, for example via enabling access to remote services, the
MITRE ATT&CK for ICS spearphishing attachment technique
explicitly refers to an adversary sending malware via email. 5
A prime example of this technique in use is TALONITE’s utilization
of engineering-themed spearphishing emails to deliver malicious
documents and executables, such as the FlowCloud malware, which
has been deployed against the United States Electric sector.6

WHITEPAPER
Despite the widespread knowledge of this technique, adversaries continue to utilise spearphishing
attachments, largely owing to the continued success of the technique and the relative ease in
execution. Thankfully, security measures such as end-user security awareness training paired with
a multi-layered approach to security can be highly effective in minimising the risk of further
follow-on activity.

Supply Chain Compromise [T0862]
At least 6 out of the 15 Dragos Activity Groups have leveraged the Supply Chain Compromise
technique to facilitate initial access.

ALLANITE

CHRYSENE

DYMALLOY

HEXANE

RASPITE

XENOTIME

The Supply Chain Compromise technique is defined within the
MITRE ATT&CK for ICS Initial Access tactic as “the manipulation of
products, such as devices or software, or their delivery mechanisms
before receipt by the end consumer.7” While the targeting of the
supply chain forms the distinctive initial component of the attack,
the objective is to compromise the target environment/endconsumer in mind.
While software updates and routine patching are frequently
abused, these are not the only potential entry vector in a supply
chain intrusion. Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM), vendors,
and third-party contractors could provide an ingress into ICS/OT
environments via compromised or poorly secured direct network
connections and remote access connections.
The last 12-18 months has been saturated with numerous
examples of supply chain compromises, such as the SolarWinds
incident amongst many others.8 Nevertheless, one of the most
notable examples in an ICS/OT context is XENOTIME’s compromise
of ICS vendors and manufacturers, which provided potential supply
chain threat opportunities and vendor-enabled access to target
ICS networks.9

A key defensive recommendation in relation to supply-chain compromises is to ensure that
third-party connections and OT interactions are monitored and logged, while adopting a “trust,
but verify” approach. Adding to this, it is important (where possible) to isolate or create
demilitarized zones (DMZs) for such access to ensure that third parties cannot gain complete
access to the entire OT network. Additionally, Dragos recommends that defenders explore the
implementation of features such as jump hosts, bastion hosts, and secure remote authentication
schema wherever possible. Finally, as a proactive measure, it is also recommended that organizations
conduct third party security reviews when evaluating potential vendors.

WHITEPAPER

Exploitation of Remote Services and/or Public-Facing
Applications [T0866 & T0819]
The exploitation of public-facing applications and/or remote services techniques have been utilized by
at least five Dragos activity groups as part of initial access operations.

ELECTRUM

KAMACITE

PARISITE

VANADINITE

The exploitation of public-facing applications and/or remote
services techniques refer to the exploitation of a vulnerability or
weakness in the underlying software, which yields access to the
associated victim host. 10,11 While MITRE ATT&CK for ICS classifies
these two exploitation types as different techniques, for the
purpose of this whitepaper they have been listed together given
their similarities in mitigative measures. It is important to note that
exploitation of public-facing applications may also be paired with
other initial access techniques. For example, a vulnerability in a
strategically significant website could be exploited to facilitate
the hosting of malicious code, which could later be used as part
of drive-by compromises.

One such example of the Exploitation of Remote Services
Technique [T0866] is PARISITE’s targeting of ICS/OT organizaXENOTIME
tions using known Virtual Private Network (VPN) vulnerabilities.
PARISITE successfully leveraged exploits against vulnerabilities
affecting Fortinet, PulseSecure and Palo Alto Networks appliances
in order to successfully develop initial access to the victim environments.12
An additional contemporary (and now almost exhaustively publicized) example of this technique
is the widespread exploitation of the Log4j vulnerability in order to achieve remote code execution
and thus initial access to a plethora of victims, many of whom were industrial organizations.13
In cases such as these, the existence of public exploits can lower the barrier of entry to utilizing
this technique for initial access, which can increase the prevalence of intrusion activity tied to a
particular vulnerability.
Given that both the exploitation of public-facing applications and/or remote services techniques often
involve the existence of known vulnerabilities, adopting a regular patching routine is paramount to
reduce the incidence of this vector. However, in some scenarios, patching alone may not suffice, thus
placing a greater reliance on the additional controls and mitigations such as multi-layered security
paired with proactive threat hunting and the application of threat intelligence products.

WHITEPAPER

Drive-By Compromise [T0817]
The Drive-By Compromise technique has been leveraged by at least four out of the 15 Dragos Activity
Groups to obtain initial access.

ALLANITE

DYMALLOY

RASPITE

This technique refers to initial access being achieved when a
victim is exploited upon visiting a compromised website.14
In instances where specific targeting is involved, for example,
compromising a known website that is frequently visited by the
intended victim, it is referred to as a watering hole attack or a
strategic web compromise. Drive-by compromises (much like many
other techniques) can also be the primary technique or conversely
a single component of a collection of techniques. For example, an
adversary could use a compromised website to host credential
stealing code and/or facilitate the delivery of malware, both of
which could subsequently provide initial access.

STIBNITE

One such example of this technique within an ICS/OT context
is DYMALLOY’s hosting of malware on compromised industrialrelated websites to facilitate credential theft and subsequent
initial access, before leveraging a range of commodity malware such as Goodor, DorShel, and
Karagany, in addition to the overt credential dumping tool Mimikatz.15
However, not all drive-by compromises facilitate initial access. This technique can also be leveraged
as part of a wide variety of campaigns – a prime example being the watering hole on a Florida water
utility contractor website, which Dragos discovered and associated with a malicious data gathering
campaign.16

WHITEPAPER
One of the challenges associated with drive-by compromises, and especially those that are targeted
in nature, is often that legitimate and frequently browsed (by the victims) websites are compromised.
This deems content-based filtering to be somewhat ineffective and instead places an increased
emphasis on pairing end-user training with actions such as hypothesis-driven threat hunting, for
example to identify suspicious data transfer volumes to known websites above the defined baseline.
Finally, threat detection solutions such as those offered by the Dragos platform are also critical in
preventing follow-on activity.

CONCLUSION
Initial access is one of the most important adversarial tactics and may form the critical dependency
on which further tactics rely, or conversely it may be the end goal in itself. Irrespective of the
adversary’s intent, preventing successful initial access is paramount in preventing successful
intrusions against your organization.
Monitoring for threat behaviour paired with comprehensive asset visibility is critical in preventing
follow-on activity that stems from the initial access techniques listed in this blog. The Dragos
Platform is an industrial control systems (ICS) cybersecurity technology that delivers unmatched
visibility of your ICS/OT network assets and communications, rapidly pinpoints threats through
intelligence-driven analytics, and provides best-practice playbooks to investigate and respond to
threats before they cause significant impacts to your operations, processes, or people.
Defenders should also take advantage of the more slowly-changing nature of TTPs (relative to
IOCs) and utilize actionable threat intelligence to priortise their efforts. Dragos threat intelligence
leverages the Dragos Platform, our threat operations center, and other sources to provide
comprehensive insight into threats affecting industrial control security and safety worldwide.
Dragos focuses on threat behaviors and appropriate detection and response, which as highlighted
in this blog, is essential in defending against the modern-day adversary.
Looking forward, Dragos assesses with high confidence that adversaries will continue to target
ICS/OT organizations using initial access techniques such as spearfishing attachments, supply
chain compromises, drive-by compromises, and via the exploitation of remote services and/or
public-facing applications.

While this whitepaper provided a high-level overview of the initial access techniques deployed by
Dragos Activity Groups, Dragos does not publicly describe ICS/OT activity group technical details
except in extraordinary circumstances in order to limit tradecraft proliferation. However, full details
on a range of initial access techniques and campaigns are available to network defenders through
Dragos WorldView Threat Intelligence, a subscription offering that provides the latest threat
intelligence to you on a daily and weekly basis.
