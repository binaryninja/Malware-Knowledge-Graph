Is SquirrelWaffle the New Emotet? How to Detect the
Latest MalSpam Loader

November 11, 2021

Since early September, SentinelLabs has been tracking the rapid rise of a new malware
loader that previous researchers have dubbed “SquirrelWaffle”. The tool has been utilized in
multiple global attacks since then and is being likened to Emotet in the way it is being used
to conduct massive malspam campaigns.
In this post, we explain how SquirrelWaffle works, what to look out for and how to protect
your business from the latest malspam loader.

What Is SquirrelWaffle Malware?
SquirrelWaffle is a recent malware loader that is distributed through malspam – malicious
spam mail – with the purpose of infecting a device with second-stage malware such as
cracked copies of the red teaming tool Cobalt Strike and QakBot, a well-known malware that
started life as a simple banking trojan but has since evolved into a multi-functional framework
with RAT (Remote Access Trojan)-like capabilities.
Researchers have noted how the infection chain may begin with an email reply chain attack,
in which a threat actor neither inserts themselves as a new correspondent nor attempts to
spoof someone else’s email address. Instead, the attacker sends the malicious
SquirrelWaffle email from a hijacked account belonging to one of the participants. Since the
attacker has access to the whole thread, they can tailor their malspam message to fit the
context of an ongoing conversation. Given that the recipient likely already trusts the sender,
there’s an increased likelihood of the target opening the maldoc or clicking the link. Email
reply chain attacks were a hallmark of Emotet campaigns and contributed a great deal to its
success.
SquirrelWaffle first appeared in early September and defenders have noticed an uptick in
incidences of infection since then. SentinelLabs researchers have also noticed that the
malware drops unique payloads even from the same infection chain and that file path
patterns are continuing to evolve.

How Does SquirrelWaffle Infect Devices?

2/6

Initial delivery of SquirrelWaffle as a first stage loader often comes courtesy of a phishing
email with either a malicious MS Word or Excel attachment or embedded link leading to a
zip-compressed malicious document download. These maldocs contain VBS macros which
execute PowerShell to retrieve and launch the SquirrelWaffle loader.
The initial SquirrelWaffle files are written to disk as prescribed by the malicious PowerShell
script responsible for their retrieval. For example, early clusters of malicious documents
dropped SquirrelWaffle using this set of file names:
C:\Datop\test.test
C:\Datop\test1.test
C:\Datop\test2.test

Importantly, no two runs of the same malicious document will produce the same
SquirrelWaffle payloads. On each execution, the payloads written to disk will have unique
hashes.

SquirrelWaffle has been observed using more conventional file name patterns as well, such
as those with .dll extensions:

ww1.dll
ww2.dll
ww3.dll
ww4.dll
ww5.dll

In early November, we observed yet another pattern, indicating that the malware authors are
continually iterating:
good.good
good1.good
good2.good

SquirrelWaffle Shares Code With Other Attack Frameworks
SquirrelWaffle, in common with many other malware samples, uses a custom crypter. Doing
so is attractive for many reasons, not the least of which are obfuscation and anti-analysis to
prevent researchers from developing strong indicators of compromise for detection.

4/6

Researchers have shown that SquirrelWaffle uses the same custom crypter as other wellknown attack frameworks including Ursnif, Hancitor and Zloader. This is used, among other
things, to hide the malware’s Command and Control (C2) URL.
Upon infection, SquirrelWaffle can download a Cobalt Strike payload with .txt extension
and execute using the WinExec function. The other likely payload that may be downloaded
by current SquirrelWaffle infections is Qakbot.
Below we can see process injection into explorer.exe from a SquirrelWaffle infection.

If infected with Qakbot, the malware will attempt to extract email data from the host.

From the above image, we can see the C:\Users\
<user>\EmailStorage_<hostname>_<username>_<timestamp> pattern. The

“collector_log.txt” contains a record of the malware’s enumeration and exfiltration process.

How To Protect Against SquirrelWaffle
The SentinelOne platform detects and protects all customers against SquirrelWaffle infection.
In the video demonstration below, we set the agent policy to ‘Detect Only’ to observe the
infection in action. In ordinary circumstances, customers would use the Protect policy to
5/6

prevent execution.

Conclusion
Cybercriminals are quick to come up with new loaders to team up with other groups that will
help deliver a variety of payloads to achieve maximum financial gain. SquirrelWaffle is the
latest such loader, currently being used to deliver Cobalt Strike and Qakbot but which can
easily pivot to dropping any payload the operators wish. While SquirrelWaffle is certainly not
yet anywhere near as prevalent as Emotet in its heyday, all the hallmarks are there of a
campaign and infrastructure looking to grow.
