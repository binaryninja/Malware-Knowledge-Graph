The Definitive Guide to
Sharing Threat Intelligence
Threat intelligence is becoming a more ubiquitous
feature in information security programs. Whether
organizations have a full threat intelligence team,
ingest threat feeds, or simply leverage threat intelligence features found in common security tools, they
are now benefiting from threat intelligence in one way
or another. The 2016 Ponemon Study, The Value of
Threat Intelligence, indicates that 78% of organizations consider threat intelligence critical to achieving a
strong security posture.
Commensurate with the increase in the use of threat
intelligence has been an increase in sharing threat
intelligence between organizations. Industry-centric
sharing initiatives like Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs), Information Sharing and Analysis
Organizations (ISAOs), and other industry sharing
organizations have led to a dramatic increase in the
sharing of threat intelligence. Additionally, government-led initiatives from the Department of Homeland
Security (DHS), like the Automated Indicator Sharing
(AIS) program and the Cyber Information Sharing and
Collaboration Program (CISCP), and the United Kingdom’s Cyber-security Information Sharing Partnership
(CiSP), have all encouraged sharing partnerships

between governments and private organizations.
Despite the relative popularity of these sharing initiatives, member organizations are still mostly focused
on consuming what is shared instead of adding their
own contributions. There are a number of reasons for
this. Not all organizations have the resources to stand
up full-blown threat intelligence practices capable of
producing their own intelligence. While this is not a
requirement for sharing indicators or other types of
intelligence, it is still a primary reason that organizations feel they have nothing of value to contribute.
Privacy concerns are another major barrier to organizations contributing to threat intelligence sharing
initiatives. It’s not a hard sell to consume shared data
from other organizations, but there are still fears
around sharing internal threat data that might be
considered sensitive. These concerns are valid but not
insurmountable hurdles to getting more organizations
involved in sharing.
There are many quite significant benefits to sharing —
perhaps some that haven’t yet been realized. Included
here are several points for consideration in regards to
sharing threat intelligence.

Unidirectional vs. bidirectional
sharing
Sharing threat intelligence comes in many flavors.
The more common version is unidirectional threat
intelligence sharing, where one entity produces and
shares threat intelligence that others consume. Those
consuming the intelligence do not contribute in return,
often because a mechanism does not exist for “pushing” information back. Examples of unidirectional
threat intelligence sharing include:
• Open-source intelligence, which might involve
downloading a publicly available report covering a
recent attack that contains indicators and methods
used, or ingesting an open source intelligence feed.
• Closed-source reports and feeds
The other option for organizations is to engage in
bidirectional threat intelligence sharing. For most
organizations, their initial experience with this kind of
sharing likely came when joining their industry ISAC
or government sharing program. In these situations
intelligence isn’t just sent down to be consumed but
can also be ingested from member organizations.
Although sharing is allowed and encouraged in these
programs, there is no guarantee that every organization will share anything as previously noted. They are
consumers but not sharers of threat intelligence.

Concerns around sharing
intelligence
The desire to consume available threat intelligence

is a no-brainer. Whether or not specific sources of
threat intelligence should be consumed by a particular
organization, or if it has the ability to properly utilize
those sources, is a separate question outside the
scope of this discussion. Hint: These questions should
be answered by intelligence requirements, fidelity,
availability of resources, and so on. See also: Anomali
ThreatStream. Overall, the decision to consume some
source of intelligence is generally not a hard sell if it
is deemed to be required for generating actionable
intelligence in an organization.
Asking an organization to actively share indicators or
produced-intelligence is another question altogether.
Even contributing additional details or context to
intelligence shared from other organizations can
be a tall order. Below is a list of common concerns
preventing organizations from engaging in sharing
threat intelligence:
1. Privacy & liability concerns
• Scrubbing data for private information or
sensitive corporate information before sharing
is a good idea regardless of the type of sharing
involved. This is most problematic with
automated sharing as the scrubbing must be
done before the information is shared.
• The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of
2015 (CISA) has provisions to address common
concerns around privacy and liability. Some
of these protections are contingent on certain
stipulations being met. As always, proper legal
advice is highly recommended to understand

how CISA may apply to specific situations1.
• The fact that so many organizations are engaging
in sharing initiatives within their industry or with
the government is proof that privacy and liability
concerns can be overcome — either through
more accurate perception of sharing intelligence,
protective clauses in legal agreements, recent
legislation, or care in what is being shared. Regardless of the underlying reason, it is a promising trend for the future of shared intelligence.
2. “There is nothing of value to contribute.”
Organizations with smaller information security teams and smaller budgets may feel like they
don’t have anything to contribute that isn’t already
being covered by larger organizations or those with
bigger budgets. This shouldn’t preclude them from
stepping in where possible. There are often at least
some additional details that can be added to the
intelligence already shared. For example, no organization sees every possible attack or all possible
variants of a particular wave of phishing emails.
There are always be opportunities for organizations
to get involved and share something, regardless
how insignificant it may seem. These details can
aid in visibility and help produce more fully sourced
intelligence analysis.
3. Lack of expertise
Not having trained intelligence analysts on staff can
be a hindrance to contributing to shared intelligence. While it is true that lack of trained analysts
is an issue, it shouldn’t curtail the notion of sharing
altogether. By simply adding whatever context,
observed attack details, and if possible, analysis
developed by those on staff, value can still be added
to the community.
4. Fear of revealing an organization has been
hacked
The fear of sharing breach details more broadly
than with the entities absolutely necessary is common. What if the analysis details of some interesting traffic shared in the morning turned out to be
evidence of a month-long breach discovered after

further analysis? Going even further, the idea of deliberately sharing breach details quickly with sharing partners is probably a foreign concept in most
organizations. This topic is addressed more fully
later in the document in the section titled, “Where
to start or expand intelligence sharing” under item
number six.

Sharing intelligence outside of
industry verticals
Connecting to other verticals
Industry verticals are naturally a great place for
organizations to share threat intelligence. The
shared business understanding, (sometimes) similar
cultures, and industry-specific attack surface create
the perfect environment for sharing intelligence.
ISACs, ISAOs, and other industry-specific information
sharing organizations provide the legal frameworks
to facilitate sharing intelligence among member
organizations. These are probably the most likely
places that active intelligence sharing occurs for most
organizations.
We shouldn’t stop at joining our friendly neighborhood
ISAC, however. Gaining insights from organizations
outside our industry echo chamber can be an
important element of visibility. There are other
variables to consider as well.
Industries develop muscle memory around specific
threats that are commonly seen, and attacks from
certain actors or groups become easily recognizable.
What happens when one of these groups or actors
suddenly moves into a new industry, though? Chances
are that little may be known about them in that new
industry. Some information can be carried forward
through third party threat intelligence services but
likely not the full breadth of knowledge that the
previous industry has built around that actor or group
(this touches on the need for sharing with vendors but
we’ll table that discussion until later in the document).
The result is that the new industry is caught with little
knowledge of the adversary and insufficient means of
protecting themselves.
Here is a theoretical example that hopefully clarifies

this point. In 2015, it became public that giant healthcare provider, Anthem, had been breached and a
massive amount of patient data was suspected to have
been stolen2. It was later surmised that a group known
as Deep Panda (using Crowdstrike’s vernacular) was
likely behind the attack. Supposing this attribution was
accurate, and supposing other attacks associated with
this group were also accurate, it’s likely that Anthem
had no reason to believe that this group would target
them. Prior to the attack, public reporting about this
group noted that they had been involved in several sectors such as defense, financial institutions, and government agencies — nothing relating to healthcare3.
Had entities within the defense and healthcare industries shared intelligence, there might have been some
transfer of knowledge about these actors that could
have bolstered Anthem’s defenses, potentially leading
to an earlier detection or prevention of the breach.
This is obviously heavy speculation, as Anthem still
would not have had any reason to assume this group
was shifting to healthcare. Regardless, intelligence
sharing between these industries certainly wouldn’t
have hurt. The benefits go both ways as actors and
groups shift tools and tactics between and across
industries.

Localized intelligence sharing
Finding partners local to your organization’s physical
location also has benefits. Not all attacks are remote
in nature. Physical breaches, WiFi attacks, USB drive
drops, and hybrid trespassing/information security
attacks may indicate local actors with physical access
to entities in the local area. Additionally, localized
events such as weather, terrorist attacks, accidents,
etc. would benefit from localized sharing of intelligence
that is not dependant upon an industry vertical. In the
United States, DHS Fusion Centers are a great place to
start with localized, cross-industry sharing. Networking at local security events is a great place to find good
intelligence sharing partners as well.

Sharing intelligence with smaller organizations
Sharing with smaller organizations can also be beneficial because they see tactics that bigger organiza-

tions may not. They can represent low-hanging fruit
to attackers because they often don’t have the budget
for the comprehensive security tools and security staff
that larger organizations have. Sharing with smaller
organizations has benefits that can go both ways —
smaller firms can benefit from the deeper expertise of
the larger ones and larger organizations benefit from
the broader visibility smaller firms can provide into
current threat tactics. This encourages both organizations to impart knowledge of intelligence practices
and other important skills. Resources in these smaller
organizations will hopefully become regular contributors to intelligence sharing and become just as
valuable as resources from larger organizations.

Targeted or not
Sharing intelligence about specific campaigns or
attacks can bring additional context back in return.
Knowing whether or not other organizations were
affected by a specific campaign is enough to indicate
that it wasn’t targeted only to your organization.
Granted there are often a variety of ways to gain
visibility into whether or not an attack was targeted
only to your organization, such as a quick check on
VirusTotal. But what about those times when there
are no signs of the attack across those resources, how
can you tell for sure? Broadly sharing intelligence with
numerous partners can help add some visibility to this
question. Such sharing is beneficial because it provides additional context about attacks from organizations that actually experienced it. Knowing the attack
was aimed specifically at your industry or perhaps
aimed at businesses sponsoring a specific event is
valuable information.
But what if it was targeted only to my organization,
and and I’ve just informed the other organizations of
the details? They could accidentally share that information with an antivirus vendor and discern that you
are tracking the attack when their malware is caught.
This is a legitimate concern that highlights the need
for all of us to be good sharing partners. We all need
to be very cautious with information shared in confidence. Honoring the Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) or any
other guidelines agreed to when we enter into sharing
agreements with other organizations is paramount

to successful intelligence sharing. Holding others
accountable in these agreements is also important to
maintain a culture of integrity and help ensure proper
stewardship of shared intelligence amongst all parties
involved. Ultimately, the rewards still far outweigh
the risks in sharing even sensitive information about
attacks, campaigns, attackers, or other intelligence.

Diversified security and expertise
Organizations all have varied security tools and different expertise in their security programs. This is a
bit of a common sense point to make that is generally
understood without having to point it out. However,
this fact has implications in the world of threat intelligence. The collective set of security tools, intelligence
collection mechanisms, and available expertise an
organization has represents its threat intelligence
visibility. This gives the organization a unique pointof-view when it comes to knowledge gleaned about
particular pieces of malware, campaigns, and depending on the maturity of their threat intelligence
program, even of threat actors and the like. In a
sharing collective, having access to organizations
with different security tools and experts with different backgrounds can mean different insights applied
to threat intelligence questions. This translates into
broader collective knowledge when all these resources are brought to bear on a particular topic, campaign,
or other intelligence question. Organizations going it
alone don’t get this expanded view into threats or other topics of interest. Of course, these benefits are also
contingent on participation from the various organizations involved as well.

Sharing with... <gasp> vendors
Vendors engaged in collecting threat intelligence
have several benefits to offer that can augment threat
intelligence programs. They often employ human
intelligence collection (HUMINT) as well as technical
collection methods not performed by most organizations (crawlers, specialized honeypots, etc.).
This results in broader visibility and enrichment to
existing intelligence collection mechanisms inside
organizations. These intelligence vendors often do not
have much visibility into what is actually seen inside
organizations unless they happen to have a part of
their business that deals with incident response. Post

breach forensic details provide a rich connector to externally collected intelligence with what is seen inside
an organization after a breach. Intelligence created on
a day-to-day basis from inside organizations is often
not something intelligence vendors have access to.
The result is that organizations themselves have to
be the connector between externally gathered intelligence and what they collect from their own networks.
This works — but further value might be gained if
certain intel were shared back to these vendors so
their analysts could correlate what they know with
observed intelligence from inside organizations.
This is usually a contentious suggestion. Generally
speaking, organizations aren’t keen on letting third
party vendors have access to internally generated
intelligence. Especially if those vendors are viewed as
“turning a profit” on freely divulged information.
These concerns aren’t off-base but when I was at my
previous job, I had a different perspective on this matter. I realized that there was a problem with visibility
on both sides of the equation. Working inside a corporate security program, I didn’t have the resources to
staff up and start doing human intelligence collection
everywhere I had adversaries. I didn’t have the resources to try and stand up all the technical collection
apparatus I wanted to either. Paying for third-party intelligence was a way to fill-in these gaps. This helped
in my opinion but I realized the intelligence providers
didn’t always have the data curated in a way that was
contextualized specifically to my environment. Outside of looking for intelligence relevant to my industry
or my company’s name, how would they even know
what I was seeing on a daily basis to give me relevant intelligence on that level? It was up to me or my
analysts to sift through what they had available and
find connections to stuff we observed or had interest
in. Even then, sometimes it was difficult to find substantially useful intelligence to what we were seeing.
Sometimes it was and sometimes it wasn’t. Requests
for Information (RFIs) certainly help fill this gap but I
didn’t want to rely on these on a daily basis.
There had to be a more efficient way to collaborate
with them. If they could see what we were seeing
internally, in theory they could direct their collection
efforts more accurately to my observed threats and
augment my intelligence in a much more meaningful
manner. Wishful thinking perhaps, but probably not

outside the realm of reason.
In a previous role, I reached out to two of our vendors where I felt we had a strong enough relationship
with to test this out. Interestingly, one was a traditional threat intelligence vendor and the other was
in a slightly different space in information security. I
trusted their researchers and the overall integrity of
their leadership and I felt they would be able to turn
our internally-generated intelligence into something
useful back. I changed positions not long after these
discussions so I was never able to see these efforts
fulfilled. It’s hard to say what would have happened.
Despite that, I’m still a firm believer that some sharing
back to vendors could be a very beneficial effort.
General thoughts on this:
1. Careful selection of vendors to partner with in
this manner
• What will I get back for sharing with them?
• Who inside their organization will see the data?
What are their roles?
• What will they do with the data?
• Do I trust them?
2. Carefully scrub anything shared with them
• What is the minimum amount of information I can
provide to see results?
• No private info or sensitive company info
3. Ensure a legal framework is in place to protect
both sides
• Ensure the data is used as expected and not sold
to other parties, etc.
• Work with lawyers to make sure proper protections are in place
4. Shouldn’t be limited to just “threat
intelligence” vendors
• Who does my organization have a relationship
with that might benefit from this data and help
better protect my org as a result?

Where to start or expand
intelligence sharing
Whether your organization is already actively sharing
intelligence or hasn’t begun doing so yet, here are

some tips on where to get started or ways to enhance
sharing that is already happening:

1. Tools and communities
Begin with choosing appropriate tools to share threat
intelligence. Email is the easiest place to start but
focus on moving into more formal methods of sharing
through available tools possibly leveraging standards
such as STIX and TAXII. ISACs and other industry organizations are perfect communities to get started with
intelligence sharing and normally have mechanisms in
place for doing so. Ad hoc sharing with local entities
or partners in other industries may start out less
formal at first but work to leverage standard tools and
sharing mechanisms with these as well. From a tools
perspective Anomali STAXX is a free solution offered
by Anomali that supports sharing indicators through
STIX and TAXII. Anomali ThreatStream users already
have a very robust solution to share indicators and
other intelligence with other organizations or create
their own sharing communities.

2. Share and contribute
Make sure to contribute to sharing once sharing
partnerships are in place. Also contribute where
your team can add additional context to intelligence
shared from other parties. Sharing observed adversary behaviors, attacks seen, or details from incident
response are great places to start. Don’t worry if
there isn’t much in the way of analysis added to what
is shared initially. Watch for sharing things that have
already been shared. If the phishing attack you were
about to share has already been shared by someone
else, look through what they provided and see if there
is additional context you or your team can add. Try to
gauge the value of what is being shared in your community and tune what gets shared out accordingly.
Don’t forget about historical context. Being able to tie
this morning’s phishing barrage to a similar barrage 3
days or a week ago helps to identify a specific actor’s
activities. Being able to eventually identify several
attack campaigns that seem to be associated with the
same actor or group helps to build a profile of what
that actor likes to do and how they like to do it. This
process is much easier when looking at actor activities broadly across several organizations and tying
them together along with historical details and other
contextual enrichments.

3. Share outside your vertical
Look for opportunities to share with organizations
outside of your vertical. This includes localized entities
such as Fusion Centers as well as other organizations
deemed to be a good fit for sharing intelligence. The
idea of sharing with outside entities is becoming more
accepted in organizations thanks to ISACs, legislation, and government initiatives around this subject.
Leveraging this acceptance to build trust and sharing
relationships with entities outside of the industry vertical and government should garner some success. As
always, working closely with legal teams/lawyers to
draw up appropriate agreements to facilitate sharing
between the entities is really a requirement.

4. Consider sharing with vendors
This suggestion probably isn’t for everybody, but if
the section on sharing with vendors resonated with
you, consider some potential vendors who might be
beneficial to share intelligence with and reach out to
them. Chances are they will not necessarily have a
mechanism in place to ingest intelligence from your
organization but see what makes sense to start with if
a sharing agreement can be reached.

5. Share hunting & defense techniques
While the focus of this document has centered around
sharing intelligence, consider other items to share
as well. Threat hunting details such as searches that
have proved valuable, specific log entries that are
useful, and other related details can turn into shortcuts in other organizations’ hunting efforts. Hopefully
they return the favor and it becomes a force multiplier
in threat hunting. Also, sharing any successful defense
techniques or rules such as YARA rules, snort signatures, Bro rules, scripts, and anything else that can
easily be replicated between organizations. The more
we share with each other, the harder it will become for
the bad guys.

6. Share breach details
Breaches can be sticky subjects inside organizations.
The usual reaction to a full-blown information security

breach is to engage the authorities, employ a thirdparty incident response organization to help clean
things up, notify whoever is required to notify, and
release as little detail outside of those efforts as
possible. While this strategy works in some ways,
it falls short of what is truly possible in providing a
better response. Depending on the legal framework
in place that facilitates intelligence sharing, ample
protections around disclosure could already exist
to ensure protection for sharing breach details with
sharing partners (consult legal advice pertinent
to your specific agreements to be sure). What this
brings is a variety of potential benefits for all parties
involved. Pushing out breach details quickly could
mean the difference in someone else being breached
and being able to stop it quickly. Also, it could bring
lots of assistance in terms of additional intelligence
and quicker answers to incident response challenges
thanks to the additional resources from other
organizations adding their skills and expertise to the
event. The other organizations are going to find out
about the event one way or another, why not leverage
their help while it’s still going on?

Conclusion
Sharing threat intelligence is gradually becoming an
accepted component in information security defense. There are still a number of ways we can gain
more through sharing threat intelligence, however. By engaging more actively and more broadly in
sharing, we pass information more quickly; we can
make better judgements; and we can deliver more
insightful analysis to stakeholders and intelligence
consumers. Changes to malware, infrastructure, new
tools, new techniques, actor behaviors, campaigns,
and other intelligence-related details can all become
quickly known across a multitude of organizations.
Ultimately, the bad guys may be trying to compromise
single organizations but are battling a collective in the
process.
