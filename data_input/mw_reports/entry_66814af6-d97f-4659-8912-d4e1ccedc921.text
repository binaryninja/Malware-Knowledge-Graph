Cyberattacks targeting health care must stop

Two global issues will help shape people’s memories of this time in history – Covid-19 and
the increased use of the internet by malign actors to disrupt society. It’s disturbing that these
challenges have now merged as cyberattacks are being used to disrupt health care
organizations fighting the pandemic. We think these attacks are unconscionable and should
be condemned by all civilized society. Today, we’re sharing more about the attacks we’ve
seen most recently and are urging governments to act.
In recent months, we’ve detected cyberattacks from three nation-state actors targeting seven
prominent companies directly involved in researching vaccines and treatments for Covid-19.
The targets include leading pharmaceutical companies and vaccine researchers in Canada,
France, India, South Korea and the United States. The attacks came from Strontium, an
actor originating from Russia, and two actors originating from North Korea that we call Zinc
and Cerium.
Among the targets, the majority are vaccine makers that have Covid-19 vaccines in various
stages of clinical trials. One is a clinical research organization involved in trials, and one has
developed a Covid-19 test. Multiple organizations targeted have contracts with or
investments from government agencies from various democratic countries for Covid-19
related work.

Strontium continues to use password spray and brute force login attempts to steal login
credentials. These are attacks that aim to break into people’s accounts using thousands or
millions of rapid attempts. Zinc has primarily used spear-phishing lures for credential theft,
sending messages with fabricated job descriptions pretending to be recruiters. Cerium
engaged in spear-phishing email lures using Covid-19 themes while masquerading as World
Health Organization representatives. The majority of these attacks were blocked by security
protections built into our products. We’ve notified all organizations targeted, and where
attacks have been successful, we’ve offered help.
These are just among the most recent attacks on those combating Covid-19. Cyberattacks
targeting the health care sector and taking advantage of the pandemic are not new.
Attackers recently used ransomware attacks to target hospitals and healthcare organizations
across the United States. Earlier in the pandemic, attacks targeted Brno University
Hospital in the Czech Republic, Paris’s hospital system, the computer systems of Spain’s
hospitals, hospitals in Thailand, medical clinics in the U.S. state of Texas, a health care
agency in the U.S. state of Illinois and even international bodies such as the World Health
Organization. In Germany, we recently saw the resulting threat to human health become
tragic reality when a woman in Dusseldorf reportedly became the first known death as a
result of a cyberattack on a hospital.
Today, Microsoft’s president Brad Smith is participating in the Paris Peace Forum where he
will urge governments to do more. Microsoft is calling on the world’s leaders to affirm that
international law protects health care facilities and to take action to enforce the law. We
believe the law should be enforced not just when attacks originate from government
agencies but also when they originate from criminal groups that governments enable to
operate – or even facilitate – within their borders. This is criminal activity that cannot be
tolerated.
The good news is that we’re not alone. Our voice at Microsoft is just one of many speaking
up from the multi-stakeholder coalition that will be needed to make progress. In today’s
virtual Paris Peace Forum event addressing an audience of international leaders, Brad will
discuss these issues with France’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Jean-Yves le Drian,
Ambassador Guilherme de Aguiar Patriota of Brazil and Ambassador Jürg Lauber of
Switzerland. Ambassador Patriota is chair of the UN’s Group of Governmental Experts, and
Ambassador Lauber is chair of the UN’s Open-Ended Working Group – both important
bodies in determining the future of cyberspace.
In the leadup to this year’s Paris Peace Forum, more than 65 health care-related
organizations have joined the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace. They include
organizations like Merck working on vaccines, top hospitals like Hospital Metropolitano in
Ecuador, and government health institutes like Poland’s National Institute of Public Health.
There is no question the attacks we’ve seen in recent months are creating energy for action

across the health sector. The Paris Call remains the largest multi-stakeholder coalition
addressing these issues, and its first principle is the prevention of malicious cyber activities
that threaten indiscriminate or systemic harm to people and critical infrastructure.
In May, a 136-strong group of the world’s most prominent international law experts, in what
has become known as the Oxford Process, issued a statement making it clear that
international law protects medical facilities at all times. In August, the Oxford Process issued
a second statement emphasizing that organizations that research, manufacture and
distribute of Covid-19 vaccines are also protected.
Earlier this year, the CyberPeace Institute and International Committee of the Red Cross led
an effort by 40 international leaders calling on governments to stop the attacks on
healthcare. They included former secretary of state Madeline Albright, Archbishop Emeritus
of Cape Town Desmond Tutu, former Member of the European Parliament Marietje Schaake
and former Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon among many others.
Organizations are also taking steps to protect themselves. In April, we announced that we
were making AccountGuard, our threat notification service, available to health care and
human rights organizations working on Covid-19. Since then 195 of these organizations have
enrolled in the service and we now protect 1.7 million email accounts for health care-related
groups. Any health care-related organizations that wish to enroll can do so here.
At a time when the world is united in wanting an end to the pandemic and anxiously awaiting
the development of a safe and effective vaccine for Covid-19, it is essential for world leaders
to unite around the security of our health care institutions and enforce the law against
cyberattacks targeting those who endeavor to help us all. You can learn more about what
Microsoft is doing to advance cybersecurity here.
