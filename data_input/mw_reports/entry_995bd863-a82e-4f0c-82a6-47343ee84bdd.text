Egregor ransomware

Since mid-September 2020, the ANSSI (French National Cyber Security Agency) has observed a vast campaign of
attacks using the Egregor ransomware. At least 69 organisations, including some French companies, are believed
to have been targeted [1] [2]. As ransomware, Egregor poses a signiﬁcant threat since the activity of victim organisations is deeply affected. Bitcoin ransom demands can be in excess of $4,000,000 [2].

1 Business model
Egregor is operated using the Ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) [3] business model. Several attacker groups may
therefore carry out attacks delivering Egregor and the kill chain may vary from one attack to the other. The ransomware operators are not necessarily its developers.
Egregor is part of the Sekhmet malware family, discovered in March 2020 [4]. Its operators attempt to break into
the target organisation’s information system to steal sensitive documents and encrypt them. They then seek the
payment of a ransom in exchange for which they claim to be able to decrypt these documents [5].
Targeted organisations are also blackmailed with the threat of disclosure of their data: if the ransom is not paid
within three days, operators threaten to publish the stolen ﬁles on a dedicated website [6]. To increase the pressure
on victims, operators may also threaten to release some of the stolen information to the media [7].
Operators reportedly pay 30% of the proﬁts to the developers [8].

2 Origins and links with the Sekhmet and Maze
ransomwares
attacks campaign delivering Egregor is believed to be linked to the end of the activity of the attacker group behind
the Maze ransomware [9] [10]. As a result, many previous Maze affiliates are believed to have started using Egregor. Furthermore, some operators of other malware, such as those of the Qakbot RAT are now believed to prefer
Egregor over Prolock as the ﬁnal payload [11] [2].
Many researchers consider Egregor the direct descendant of Maze. This assumption is based on several factors:
• Chronology: Egregor’s expansion coincides with the end of activity of the Maze ransomware [6].
• There are thought to be several code similarities between Egregor, Sekhmet and Maze [7] [12] [13] [14].
Sekhmet and Maze also use the same encryption algorithms (ChaCha and RSA-2048).
• The ransom notes of Maze, Sekhmet and Egregor are also very similar [15]. In addition to their similar
structure, parts of Egregor’s ransom notes are identical [6].
• The same infrastructure (IP 185.238.0[.]233) is believed to have distributed both Maze and Egregor, as well as
zip ﬁles containing the ﬁle synchronisation tool RClone and the conﬁguration ﬁles [6].
Furthermore, Egregor reportedly shows similarities with other ransomwares and malicious codes, such as Clop and
TinyMet Payload v0.2 [1].
Comment: It is common for different ransomware operators to be inspired by the latest tactics and techniques. However,
all of these factors suggest that it is likely that one or more players in the Maze group is now working on Egregor, or at
the very least, that part of the Maze code has been sold on or recovered by Egregor’s developers.

3 Victimology
Egregor is used in attacks targeting organisations because of their proﬁtability or their ability to pay high ransom
amounts (Big Game Hunting).

All activity sectors and all geographical areas represent potential targets. However, many of Egregor’s victims are
located in the United States and belong to the service and manufacturing sectors [11] [2].

4 Kill chain
4.1 Infection vector
Little is currently known about the infection vector(s) used. Nevertheless, they appear to be using phishing emails
with an attachment containing a malicious macro [6] as well as illegitimate Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access.

4.2 Lateral movement
The Qakbot banking Trojan is believed to be currently used to distribute Egregor along with the Prolock ransomware. In at least one case, Egregor operators reportedly used Microsoft Excel documents imitating DocuSign
encrypted documents and email thread hijacking to distribute Qakbot [2].
The Ursnif and IcedID trojans are also thought to have been used by the Egregor operators. The use of these
malicious codes allow the operators to retrieve information facilitating subsequent lateral movements [6]. The operators are also thought to have distributed Qakbot over the network using the PsExec tool [2].

As Maze affiliates migrate to Egregor, the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used by Egregor operators may
evolve in line with the TTPs usually associated with Maze [2].
The SharpHound or AdFind tools are believed to have been used during the lateral movement phase within the
Active Directory (AD). To move around the network, Egregor operators are believed to use SMB beacons via the
Cobalt Strike tool or administrator access. Cobalt Strike payloads can be deobfuscated using the CyberChef tool
[16]. Connections to the command and control server are made via the HTTPS protocol.

4.3 Evasion of defensive measures
Egregor uses multiple techniques of obfuscation to conceal its activities and complicate its analysis. In particular,
Egregor imitates the svchost.exe process to execute the RClone client and uses the injection of code into the memory to increase its stealth via a reﬂective dynamic-link library injection [16]).
To date, the use of code obfuscation techniques1 , anti-debugging techniques and the use of native Windows APIs
are proven. The payload can only be decrypted using a speciﬁc argument inserted in the command line. In one
incident this argument was “-passegregor10” [6]. During another incident, the following command was used to run
the dll to decrypt and then run Egregor [2]:
rundll32.exe C:\Windows\q.dll,DllRegisterServer -password --mode
According to an analysis by CybleInc, the Egregor dll was compiled by Microsoft Visual C++ 8.0 and contains 3 export functions: DllInstall, DllRegisterServer and DllUnregisterServer [1].

4.4 Exﬁltration
The RClone client is thought to allow operators to exﬁltrate data for blackmail and disclosure purposes [2].

4.5 Encryption
Egregor seeks to stop numerous processes to ensure that they do not access the ﬁles during encryption. Certain
targeted processes (procmon and dumpcat for example) are usually used by researchers and complicate analysis of
Egregor. Operators also reportedly attempt to create a Group Policy Object (GPO) to disable Windows Defender
[12].
The Bitsadmin command line tool is believed to have been used to download and execute the malicious Egregor dll.
The payload is injected into an “iexplore.exe” process and starts the encryption. When the payload is executed, it
ﬁrst checks the language of the operating system [12]. If the system is conﬁgured in one of the following languages,
the machine will not be encrypted:
• Armenian (Armenia);
• Azeri (Cyrillic, Azerbaijan);
• Belarusian (Belarus);
• Georgian (Georgia);
• Kazakh (Kazakhstan);
• Kyrgyz (Kyrgyzstan);
• Moldovan (Moldova);
• Russian (Moldova);
• Russian (Russia);
• Tajiki (Cyrillic, Tajikistan);
• Tatar (Russia);
• Turkmen (Turkmenistan);
1 In particular, the command PUSH + JUMP instead of RETN is used in XOR operations [12] [16].

• Ukrainian (Ukraine);
• Uzbek (Latin, Uzbekistan).
This practice is common among ransomwares. However, researchers believe that the veriﬁcation method of the
language used by Egregor is very similar to that of Sekhmet and Maze [2].
Egregor attempts to create a shortcut in directories to check that it has the privileges required to encrypt their
content. This shortcut is created with the following option:
FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE
This option ensures that the shortcut is deleted automatically [2].

Egregor also attempts to remove shadow copies.
Comment: The ANSSI is not currently able to conﬁrm the use of the vssadmin command by Egregor operators. The
Raccine tool available on GitHub can intercept the use of vssadmin, prevent the deletion of shadow copies and even, in
some cases, block the chain of infection. Raccine is a temporary solution only to be implemented as a last resort in the
face of an imminent threat of encryption. Its use is not a substitute for the implementation of technical security measures.
Egregor uses ChaCha encryption algorithms and RSA-2048. Once encrypted, the ﬁles are renamed by adding a new
random extension corresponding to the following regular expression [1]:
{[a-zA-Z] {4,6}}
No tool is currently capable of decrypting encrypted ﬁles other than the private key held by the operators.
A “RECOVER-FILES.txt” text ﬁle containing the ransom note is created in all folders containing encrypted documents. This ﬁle also contains the procedure for contacting the ransomware operators [1]. The technical block at
the end of the ransom ﬁle also contains information about the number of encrypted ﬁles, the workstation and the
affected domain [2].

4.6 Disclosure of data
Several domains have been used by Egregor operators. The domains “egregor-support.com”, “egregorsup.com” and
“newsegregor.com” are attributed to the Egregor ransomware. Investigations carried out by the ANSSI show that
all three have been ﬁled with the registrar Eranet and use DNSPod name servers. This registrar/name server pair is
fairly uncommon, however it is consistent with the registration habits of other attacker group domains, including
some domains attributed to TA505.
The “egregor-support.com” and “egregorsup.com” domains allow contact to be made in order to decrypt ﬁles and/or
negotiate with operators. The “newsegregor.com” and “egregoranrmzapcv.onion” domains are used to disclose
data.
Comment: This could indicate that these groups share the same service providers for domain registration. This conﬁrms
the trend towards outsourcing as well as task-based specialisation within cyber criminal groups.

5 The Twisted Spider group
On 1st November 2020, the Twisted Spider group issued a press release indicating the end of the “Maze Team”
project.
At the end of October 2020, the Egregor site operators threatened to distribute stolen data on various forums,
the darknet and via torrent if their domains continued to be targeted by attackers [7]. In at least one incident,
comments in Russian were included in a PowerShell script used by the attackers [2]. An operator of the group
reportedly declared in June 2020 that the group was now cooperating with other attacker groups [9].
Comment: It is possible that the high degree of visibility acquired by the Maze group may have forced the group to bring
the project to an end. Some of the members would then have developed Sekhmet in the event of the Maze project coming to a close. With Sekhmet having proven its worth, it is thought to have become Egregor following this closure. This
hypothesis would explain the many similarities between these three different ransomwares.

7 Recommendations
In order to protect against and react to this type of attack, the ANSSI recommends consulting the Attaques par
rançongiciels, tous concernés – Comment les anticiper et réagir en cas d’incident? (Ransomware attacks, all concerned
- How to anticipate them and react in the event of an incident) guide.
To reduce the risk of ransomware attacks, especially by Egregor:
• back up data regularly, physically move the backup of your network and put it in a safe place while ensuring
it works;
• have the capacity to detect and block the use of Cobalt Strike on the network;
• be particularly vigilant with RDP connections and the use of BITS, wmic and PowerShell on the network;
• keep software and systems up to date. Special attention must be paid to VPN solutions and their updates to
allow remote access for your employees;
• if possible, disable macros in office automation solutions that allow the automated completion of tasks. This
rule will prevent the spread of ransomware via application vulnerabilities;
• encrypt sensitive documents on your network to prevent their possible disclosure [17];
• use anti-virus software and keep it updated;
• partition the information system;
• limit user privileges and application permissions;
• if possible, do not expose remote office services (such as RDP) on public networks and use complex passwords
on these services;
• control Internet access;
• implement the supervision of logs;
• ensure awareness among employees;
• implement a plan to respond to cyber attacks;
• think about the cyber crisis communication strategy.
The ANSSI’s advice on how to react in the event of an attack:
• ensure that attackers have not moved laterally if Qakbot, Ursnif or IcedID is detected on the network;
• coordinate the management of the cyber crisis;
• ﬁnd technical assistance;
• immediately disconnect the machines from the network without deleting their data;
• communicate at the appropriate level;
• do not pay the ransom;
• ﬁle a complaint;
• restore systems from healthy sources.
