A Hacker Tried to Poison a Florida City's Water Supply,
Officials Say

Around 8 am on Friday morning, an employee of a water treatment plant in the 15,000person city of Oldsmar, Florida, noticed that his mouse cursor was moving strangely on his
computer screen, out of his control, as local police would later tell it. Initially, he wasn't
concerned; the plant used the remote-access software TeamViewer to allow staff to share
screens and troubleshoot IT issues, and his boss often connected to his computer to monitor
the facility's systems.
But a few hours later, police say, the plant operator noticed his mouse moving out of his
control again. This time there would be no illusion of benign monitoring from a supervisor or
IT person. The cursor began clicking through the water treatment plant's controls. Within
seconds, the intruder was attempting to change the water supply's levels of sodium
hydroxide, also known as lye or caustic soda, moving the setting from 100 parts per million to
11,100 parts per million. In low concentrations the corrosive chemical regulates the PH level
of potable water. At high levels, it severely damages any human tissue it touches.
According to city officials, the operator quickly spotted the intrusion and returned the sodium
hydroxide to normal levels. Even if he hadn't, the poisoned water would have taken 24 to 36
hours to reach the city's population, and automated PH testing safeguards would have
triggered an alarm and caught the change before anyone was harmed, they say.

"Did this come from down the street or outside the country? No idea."
Bob Gualtieri, Pinellas County Sheriff
But if the events described by local officials are confirmedâ€”they have yet to be corroborated
firsthand by external security auditorsâ€”they may well represent a rare publicly reported
cyberintrusion aimed at actively sabotaging the systems that control a US city's critical
infrastructure. "This is dangerous stuff," said Bob Gualtieri, the sheriff of Pinellas County,
Florida, of which Oldsmar is a part, in a press conference Monday afternoon. "This is
somebody that is trying, it appears on the surface, to do something bad."
In a follow-up call with WIRED, Gualtieri said that the hacker appears to have compromised
the water treatment plant's TeamViewer software to gain remote access to the target
computer, and that network logs confirm the operator's mouse takeover story. But the sheriff
had little else to share about how the hacker accessed TeamViewer or gained initial access
to the plant's IT network. He also provided no details as to how the intruder broke into the socalled operational technology network that controls physical equipment in industrial control
systems and is typically segregated from the internet-connected IT network.
Gualteri said the city's own forensic investigators, as well as the FBI and Secret Service, are
seeking those answers. "Thatâ€™s the million-dollar question, and itâ€™s a point of concern,
because we donâ€™t know where the hole is and how sophisticated these people are," Gualteri
said. "Did this come from down the street or outside the country? No idea."
Security professionals have long advised not only segregating IT and OT networks for
maximal security but also limiting or ideally eliminating all connections from operational
technology systems to the internet. But Gualteri conceded that the plant's OT systems were
externally accessible, and that all evidence points to the attacker accessing them from the
internet. "There is merit to the point that critical infrastructure components shouldnâ€™t be
connected," Gualteri said. "If youâ€™re connected, youâ€™re vulnerable."
Gualteri said that the water treatment facility had uninstalled TeamViewer since the attack,
but he couldn't otherwise comment on what other security measures the plant was taking to
remove the intruder's access or prevent another breach. He added that officials have warned
all government organizations in the wider Tampa Bay area to review their security protocols
and make updates to protect themselves. "We want to make sure that everyone realizes
these kind of bad actors are out there. It's happening," Oldmar mayor Eric Seidel said in a
press conference. "So really take a hard look at what you have in place."
As unprecedented as Oldmar's public announcement of a cybersabotage attempt on its
water systems may be, the attack it describes is hardly unique, says Lesley Carhart, a
principal threat analyst at industrial control system security firm Dragos. She says she's seen
incidents firsthand in which even unsophisticated hackers access software applications that
offer control of physical equipmentâ€”such as the TeamViewer remote access tool reportedly

used in Oldmar or the human-machine interfaces (HMIs) that directly control equipmentâ€”
and start messing with them. Thousands of such systems are discoverable over the internet
with search tools like Shodan, she points out. It's often only the complexity and safeguards in
industrial control systems that prevent hacker meddling from having serious consequences.
"Do I think that on a regular basis people are logging in to HMI systems and hitting buttons?
Absolutely," says Carhart. "Do those things have a measurable impact on the real world?
Very rarely."
Carhart points to a comparable incidentâ€”albeit one carried out by an insider rather than an
external attackerâ€”when a disgruntled IT consultant for a sewage treatment plant in the
Australian shire of Maroochy used his remote access to dump millions of gallons of raw
sewage into local parks and rivers. On the other end of the sophistication spectrum, the
Russian hacker group known as Sandworm in December 2015 hijacked a remote-access
software similar to the TeamViewer program used in Oldmar to open circuit breakers in
Ukrainian electric utilities, turning off the power to a quarter-million civilians. And there's an
even more direct precedent: In 2016, Verizon Security Solutions reported that hackers broke
into an unidentified water utility and changed the chemical levels.
Water treatment and sewage plants, Carhart says, are often some of the most digitally
vulnerable critical infrastructure targets in the United States, made more so by the budget
cuts and remote work scenarios imposed by the Covid-19 pandemic. She says she has dealt
with entire cities whose municipal water treatment plant has only a single IT person.
"They're doing whatever they have to to keep water flowing and sewage treated. If they don't
have the resources to do that and do cybersecurity, what are they going to do?" she asks.
"They're going to keep the process running, keep society running. That's what they have to
do."
