Key Judgments
•

The Egregor ransomware is a complex piece of malware,
employing obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques. In order to
fully decrypt and deploy the payload, the password associated
with the sample must be provided at runtime.

This report provides an overview of the ransomware variant Egregor as well as
suggested mitigations and detections. Recorded Future used the Recorded Future®
Platform, PolySwarm, open source intelligence (OSINT) sources, and malware analysis
to derive these detections. The target audience of this research includes day-to-day
security practitioners as well executive decision-makers concerned about targeting
by ransomware threat actors.

Egregor ransomware is connected to the QakBot operators.

•

The targets of the Egregor ransomware are organizations,
which Egregor both ransoms and uses the “name and shame”
double extortion technique to further victimize the companies.

According to the information available on Egregor News, they claimed 133
victims and are responsible for 13 percent of all currently known ransomware
extortion cases, which is a large number for just two months of operations. We
believe that ransomware operators and their affiliates are opportunistic by nature
and do not focus on specific industries or geographic regions, but rather select
and pursue corporations based on accessibility, opportunity, and company’s
revenue. These threat actors will very likely continue to consistently target larger
organizations. This assessment is predicated on the understanding that the wide
attack surface inherent to large corporations gives threat actors more chances to
gain access. Furthermore, these businesses maintain an abundance of resources,
and generally have strong cyber insurance policies, making it more likely that they
will pay a large ransom demand.
According to a Bankinfosecurity article, QakBot operators have abandoned
ProLock for Egregor ransomware. The TTPs used by the threat actors in Egregor
attacks are almost identical to the ones used by the ProLock operators. Group-IB
experts consider it very likely that QakBot operators have switched from ProLock
to Egregor ransomware because the threat actors always employ Microsoft Excel
documents impersonating DocuSign-encrypted spreadsheets to deliver Qakbot
as an initial access vector. Also, Egregor operators have been using Rclone for
data exfiltration, and the same tools and naming convention have been used as
well — for example, md.exe, rdp.bat, and svchost.exe.

three main “stages”: the top-level packer that decrypts the next stage using the
Salsa20 stream cipher with compiled-in keys, a subsequent stage that uses a
cryptographic key passed in at runtime to decrypt the payload, and finally the
Egregor payload. Without the correct key passed to the ransomware when it
is run, the payload is unable to be decrypted and analyzed either statically or
dynamically. We identified one sample and cryptographic key pair that enabled
analysis of the Egregor payload. To detonate the malware, the command that is

Several other researchers have tied Egregor to the Maze ransomware variant at
the technical level, suggesting that similar initial access techniques could be used
by the Egregor threat actors as those used by the Maze operators. Historically, the
operators of Maze ransomware employed a wide array of techniques to gain initial
access to organizations, most recently using RDP and remote services as initial
access vectors to victim systems, but also exploiting CVE-2018-15982 and CVE2018-4878 in Flash Player, CVE-2019-11510 in Pulse VPN, and CVE-2018-8174 in
Internet Explorer. While past behavior does not guarantee future behavior, Maze’s
operators have used a wide variety of initial access vectors, suggesting that the
threat actors behind Egregor may also do so.

Reconnaissance and Lateral Movement
Recorded Future has not observed any open source information regarding
reconnaissance or lateral movement tools. Many threat actors are using Cobalt
Strike Beacon and QakBot to enable reconnaissance and lateral movement, as well
as deploying a variety of commodity tools such as Mimikatz, PowerShell Empire,

Initial Access

The files identified by Insikt Group as containing the initial packer stage
used by Egregor were highly similar in form and function, differing primarily
in the compiled-in Salsa20 cryptographic keys, the file path it looks for upon
initialization, and a command line parameter it checks for (but does not appear to
have any real utility to the execution of the code). In addition, while some of the
files did not employ obfuscation to the code, several did to complicate the static
and dynamic reverse engineering process. This could suggest that the different
copies originate from different affiliates, some who employ an obfuscator tool and
some who do not. It is likely that this obfuscation is introduced by a tool, since
both obfuscated and unobfuscated versions were observed in the wild, but Insikt
Group is not sure whether the tool is homegrown by the actors or a commodity
item purchased or downloaded from the internet.

may remain in the code, but is currently unused by Egregor.

Outlook
The team behind Egregor has targeted several high-profile organizations to
date, and is very likely to continue doing so. The group behind Egregor will likely
remain active and continue to employ techniques associated with sophisticated
threat actors and “big-game hunting.”

The ransom note dropped by the payload can be seen in Figure 4, below.
The Tor chat link contains the victim identifier used with the created
mutex:

Recently, in an attack on a retail organization, the threat actor not only
encrypted the systems on the network, but printed out copies of the ransom note
on printers attached to the systems, further underscoring the sophistication of
the threat actors.

Mitigations
While currently there is very little known in open sources regarding how
Egregor is being deployed to victim systems, Recorded Future has identified the
following recommendations:
•

It is most effective to detect a ransomware threat prior to the deployment
of the ransomware. While Insikt Group has not observed any evidence of
how the threat actor gains initial access to victim systems, sophisticated
threat actors often deploy commodity tools such as Cobalt Strike and
QakBot to perform reconnaissance and lateral movement prior to the
deployment of a ransomware payload. Organizations should monitor
for use of these and other lateral movement/reconnaissance tools on
corporate systems in addition to the ransomware payload.

•

Because ransomware threat actors often use exploits as a means of initial
access to victimized systems, it is critical that organizations ensure that
any internet-facing systems are appropriately configured to provide the
appropriate needed access. These systems should be patched to help
mitigate the threat of vulnerabilities that are often exploited by these
types of threat actors.

•

Organizations should also be aware of the risk of phishing attacks, the
use of fake download websites, the targeting of unpatched publicly
accessible systems, and the exploitation of misconfigurations in publicly
accessible systems.
