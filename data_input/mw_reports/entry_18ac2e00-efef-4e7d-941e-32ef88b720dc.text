Executive Summary
Our research attributes a decade of activity to a threat actor we call ModifiedElephant.
ModifiedElephant is responsible for targeted attacks on human rights activists, human
rights defenders, academics, and lawyers across India with the objective of planting
incriminating digital evidence.
ModifiedElephant has been operating since at least 2012, and has repeatedly targeted
specific individuals.
ModifiedElephant operates through the use of commercially available remote access
trojans (RATs) and has potential ties to the commercial surveillance industry.
The threat actor uses spearphishing with malicious documents to deliver malware,
such as NetWire, DarkComet, and simple keyloggers with infrastructure overlaps that
allow us to connect long periods of previously unattributed malicious activity.

Background

1/7

In September 2021, SentinelLabs published research into the operations of a Turkish-nexus
threat actor we called EGoManiac, drawing attention to their practice of planting incriminating
evidence on the systems of journalists to justify arrests by the Turkish National Police. A
threat actor willing to frame and incarcerate vulnerable opponents is a critically
underreported dimension of the cyber threat landscape that brings up uncomfortable
questions about the integrity of devices introduced as evidence. Emerging details in an
unrelated case caught our attention as a potentially similar scenario worthy of more scrutiny.
Long-standing racial and political tensions in India were inflamed on January 1st, 2018 when
critics of the government clashed with pro-government supporters near Bhima Koregaon.
The event led to subsequent protests, resulting in more violence and at least one death.
In the following months, Maharashtra police linked the cause of the violence to the banned
Naxalite-Maoist Communist party of India. On April 17th, 2018, police conducted raids and
arrested a number of individuals on terrorism-related charges. The arresting agencies
identified incriminating files on the computer systems of defendants, including plans for an
alleged assassination attempt against Prime Minister Modi.
Thanks to the public release of digital forensic investigation results by Arsenal Consulting
and those referenced below, we can glean rare insights into the integrity of the systems of
some defendants and grasp the origin of the incriminating files. It turns out that a
compromise of defendant systems led to the planting of files that were later used as
evidence of terrorism and justification for the defendants’ imprisonment. The intrusions in
question were not isolated incidents.
Our research into these intrusions revealed a decade of persistent malicious activity
targeting specific groups and individuals that we now attribute to a previously unknown threat
actor named ModifiedElephant. This actor has operated for years, evading research attention
and detection due to their limited scope of operations, the mundane nature of their tools, and
their regionally-specific targeting. ModifiedElephant is still active at the time of writing.

ModifiedElephant Targets & Objectives
The objective of ModifiedElephant is long-term surveillance that at times concludes with the
delivery of ‘evidence’—files that incriminate the target in specific crimes—prior to
conveniently coordinated arrests.
After careful review of the attackers’ campaigns over the last decade, we have identified
hundreds of groups and individuals targeted by ModifiedElephant phishing campaigns.
Activists, human rights defenders, journalists, academics, and law professionals in India are
those most highly targeted. Notable targets include individuals associated with the Bhima
Koregaon case.

Infection Attempts
2/7

Throughout the last decade, ModifiedElephant operators sought to infect their targets via
spearphishing emails with malicious file attachments, with their techniques evolving over
time.
Their primary delivery mechanism is malicious Microsoft Office document files weaponized to
deliver the malware of choice at the time. The specific payloads changed over the years and
across different targets. However, some notable trends remain.
In mid-2013, the actor used phishing emails containing executable file attachments with
fake double extensions (filename.pdf.exe).
After 2015, the actor moved on to less obvious files containing publicly available
exploits, such as .doc , .pps , .docx , .rar , and password protected .rar files.
These attempts involved legitimate lure documents in .pdf , .docx , and .mht
formats to captivate the target’s attention while also executing malware.
In 2019 phishing campaigns, ModifiedElephant operators also took the approach of
providing links to files hosted externally for manual download and execution by the
target.
As first publicly noted by Amnesty in reference to a subset of this activity, the attacker
also made use of large .rar archives (up to 300MB), potentially in an attempt to
bypass detection.
Observed lure documents repeatedly made use of CVE-2012-0158, CVE-2014-1761, CVE2013-3906, CVE-2015-1641 exploits to drop and execute their malware of choice.
The spearphishing emails and lure attachments are titled and generally themed around
topics relevant to the target, such as activism news and groups, global and local events on
climate change, politics, and public service. A public deconstruction of two seperate 2014
phishing emails was shared by Arsenal Consulting in early 2021.

Spearphishing email containing malicious attachment attributed to ModifiedElephant
ModifiedElephant continually made use of free email service providers, like Gmail and
Yahoo, to conduct their campaigns. The phishing emails take many approaches to gain the
appearance of legitimacy. This includes fake body content with a forwarding history
containing long lists of recipients, original email recipient lists with many seemingly fake

3/7

accounts, or simply resending their malware multiple times using new emails or lure
documents. Notably, in specific attacks, the actor would be particularly persistent and attempt
to compromise the same individuals multiple times in a single day.
By reviewing a timeline of attacker activity, we can observe clear trends as the attacker(s)
rotate infrastructure over the years.

Timeline sample of ModifiedElephant and SideWinder C2 Infrastructure
For example, from early-2013 to mid-2016, a reasonably clear timeline can be built with little
overlap, indicating a potential evolution or expansion of activities. Dates are based on first
and last spearphishing emails observed delivering samples that communicate with a given
domain. Notably, a separate Indian-nexus threat actor, SideWinder, is placed alongside
ModifiedElephant in this graph as they were observed targeting the same individuals.

Weapons of Choice
The malware most used by ModifiedElephant is unsophisticated and downright mundane,
and yet it has proven sufficient for their objectives–obtaining remote access and unrestricted
control of victim machines. The primary malware families deployed were NetWire and
DarkComet remote access trojans (RATs). Both of these RATs are publicly available, and
have a long history of abuse by threat actors across the spectrum of skill and capability.

4/7

One particular activity revolves around the file Ltr_1804_to_cc.pdf , which contains
details of an assassination plot against Prime Minister Modi. A forensic report by Arsenal
Consulting showed that this file, one of the more incriminating pieces of evidence obtained
by the police, was one of many files delivered via a NetWire RAT remote session that we
associate with ModifiedElephant. Further analysis showed how ModifiedElephant was
performing nearly identical evidence creation and organization across multiple unrelated
victim systems within roughly fifteen minutes of each other.
Incubator Keylogger
Known victims have also been targeted with keylogger payloads stretching as far back as
2012 (0a3d635eb11e78e6397a32c99dc0fd5a). These keyloggers, packed at delivery, are
written in Visual Basic and are not the least bit technically impressive. Moreover, they’re built
in such a brittle fashion that they no longer function.
The overall structure of the keylogger is fairly similar to code openly shared on Italian
hacking forums in 2012. Further details of the ModifiedElephant variant can be found in our
full report.
In some cases, the attacker conducted multiple unique phishing attempts with the same
payloads across one or more targets. However, ModifiedElephant generally conducts each
infection attempt with new malware samples.
Android Trojan
ModifiedElephant also sent multiple phishing emails containing both NetWire and Android
malware payloads at the same time. The Android malware is an unidentified commodity
trojan delivered as an APK file (0330921c85d582deb2b77a4dc53c78b3).
While the Android trojan bears marks of being designed for broader cybercrime, its delivery
at the same time as ModifiedElephant Netwire samples indicates that the same attacker was
attempting to get full coverage of the target on both endpoint and mobile. The full report
contains further details about the Android Trojan.

Relations to Other Threat Clusters
Our research into this threat actor reveals multiple interesting threads that highlight the
complex nature of targeted surveillance and tasking, where multiple actors swoop in with
diverse mechanisms to track the same group of individuals. These include private sector
offensive actors (PSOAs) and groups with possible commercial facades to coordinate their
illicit activities.
Based on our analysis of ModifiedElephant, the group operates in an overcrowded target
space and may have relations with other regional threat actors. From our visibility, we can’t
further disambiguate the shape of that relationship–whether as part of an active umbrella
5/7

organization, cooperation and sharing of technical resources and targets across threat
groups, or simply coincidental overlaps. Some interesting overlaps are detailed below.
Multiple individuals targeted by ModifiedElephant over the years have also been either
targeted or confirmed infected with mobile surveillance spyware. Amnesty International
identified NSO Group’s Pegasus being used in targeted attacks in 2019 against human
rights defenders related to the Bhima Koregaon case. Additionally, the Bhima
Koregaon case defendant Rona Wilson’s iPhone was targeted with Pegasus since
2017 based on a digital forensics analysis of an iTunes backup found in the forensic
disk images analyzed by Arsenal Consulting.
Between February 2013 and January 2014 one target, Rona Wilson, received phishing
emails that can be attributed to the SideWinder threat actor. The relationship between
ModifiedElephant and SideWinder is unclear as only the timing and targets of their
phishing emails overlap within our dataset. This could suggest that the attackers are
being provided with similar tasking by a controlling entity, or that they work in concert
somehow. SideWinder is a threat actor targeting government, military, and business
entities primarily throughout Asia.
ModifiedElephant phishing email payloads (b822d8162dd540f29c0d8af28847246e)
share infrastructure overlaps (new-agency[.]us) with Operation Hangover. Operation
Hangover includes surveillance efforts against targets of interest to Indian national
security, both foreign and domestic, in addition to industrial espionage efforts against
organizations around the world.
Another curious finding is the inclusion of the string “Logs from Moosa’s” found in a
keylogger sample closely associated with ModifiedElephant activity in 2012
(c14e101c055c9cb549c75e90d0a99c0a). The string could be a reference to Moosa
Abd-Ali Ali, the Bahrain activist targeted around the same time, with FinFisher spyware.
Without greater information, we treat this as a low confidence conjecture in need of
greater research.

Attribution
Attributing an attacker like ModifiedElephant is an interesting challenge. At this time, we
possess significant evidence of what the attacker has done over the past decade, a unique
look into who they’ve targeted, and a strong understanding of their technical objectives.
We observe that ModifiedElephant activity aligns sharply with Indian state interests and that
there is an observable correlation between ModifiedElephant attacks and the arrests of
individuals in controversial, politically-charged cases.

Conclusion

6/7

The Bhima Koregaon case has offered a revealing perspective into the world of a threat
actor willing to place significant time and resources into seeking the disruption of those with
opposing views. Our profile of ModifiedElephant has taken a look at a small subset of the
total list of potential targets, the attackers techniques, and a rare glimpse into their
objectives. Many questions about this threat actor and their operations remain; however, one
thing is clear: Critics of authoritarian governments around the world must carefully
understand the technical capabilities of those who would seek to silence them.
