Executive Summary
Threat actors have always been adept at keeping abreast of worldwide trends – ranging from
geopolitical to technical – and rapidly exploiting these trends for their benefit. The current pandemic is
no exception. Unit 42 has previously reported on how cybercriminals have preyed on consumers during
COVID-19 and on the use of COVID-19 themed phishing attacks impersonating brands like Pfizer and
BioNTech. This article provides early warnings for the travel industry and global travelers by sharing
information about various attack attempts targeting the travel industry.
At the beginning of the pandemic, when people all over the world scrambled to get protective supplies
– personal protective equipment, sanitizer and toilet paper – threat actors tried to take advantage of
supply issues by selling fake products. They also tried to trick people by purporting to be credible

health organizations (such as the WHO) or pharmaceutical companies, all while the actual
organizations and companies were trying to make sense of the virus and come up with metrics,
protective measures and vaccines.
Although the pandemic is not over, as the world opens up borders and the vaccines slow down the
spread of the virus, people who have been cooped up at home are eager to travel. Threat actors are
taking advantage of this trend by using travel as a theme for phishing people and stealing data –
account credentials, financial information and so on – subsequently selling this data in underground
markets.
Here, we first show that there has been a substantial increase in the registration of travel-related
phishing URLs in 2021. Second, we provide two real-life examples demonstrating attackers abusing
the travel theme, including the Dridex malware distribution and the abuse of Firebase in phishing
campaigns. Third, we talk about how threat actors use various data that they steal. Finally, we
conclude with a discussion of best practices for both individuals and organizations.
Please note that Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall customers are protected from phishing
attacks with various security services, including Advanced URL Filtering and WildFire.

Increase in Travel-themed Phishing
To conduct social engineering, threat actors have always leveraged malicious domains and URLs
impersonating known brands and websites familiar to end users. The content served on these
malicious domains or URLs is crafted to mislead end users, since they look and feel very similar to
brands that users know.
Alternatively, threat actors also send phishing emails to end users to trick them into either downloading
malicious attachments or clicking on links that lead to malicious content – website pages or
attachments. Threat actors use themes that invoke a sense of urgency (such as outstanding invoices)
or appeal to the end user emotionally (such as travel-themed emails sent as the world opens up).

Increase in the Number of Travel-themed Phishing URLs
Unit 42 analyzed travel-themed phishing URLs created between October 2019 and August 2021. As
seen in Figure 1 below, there is a gradual upward trend in the registration of phishing URLs starting
early 2021, with a significant increase in June 2021. Though the new phishing URLs did not continue to
be registered at quite the frenzied rate we saw in June, throughout the summer, threat actors created
new travel-themed phishing URLs at a much higher level than at any time in 2020.

Figure 1. Number of new travel-themed phishing URLs registered between October 2019 and August
2021.
Based on the new phishing URLs that Unit 42 observed, in addition to the use of bespoke/new
domains for serving the phishing URLs, threat actors also leveraged URL shorteners such as bit.ly and
bit.do, and services such as Firebase that are hosted on Google Cloud Storage. Firebase is backed by
Google and supports developers of mobile or web applications. Firebase includes cloud storage that
enables developers to store and serve user-generated content. As Firebase leverages Google Cloud
Storage, it is possible for phishing URLs to take advantage of it to bypass email protections based on
Google’s reputation.
Unit 42 observed that not all the phishing URLs that threat actors leveraged were used for directed
attacks or campaigns; some of the URLs were used in malspam campaigns to host malicious content,
such as Dridex.

Use of Travel-themed Phishing URLs by Dridex
Dridex is mass-distribution malware that is typically sent through malspam. Dridex has been known as
an information-stealing malware or banking trojan that targets Windows platforms and is distributed via
malicious spam attachments impersonating legitimate companies.
The threat actor behind Dridex generally uses billing- or invoice-themed emails, a tactic used by most
mass-distribution malware. The compromised or malicious URLs host the initial installer for Dridex to
establish backdoor access. The backdoor access established by Dridex is later used to distribute
followup malware, including ransomware, if the initial infection is not discovered.

3/12

The domains associated with the compromised URLs leveraged by Dridex are usually legitimate but
compromised websites. For most Dridex campaigns, these URLs are used for a single day before the
campaign moves on to a different URL.
Unit 42 researchers have observed two types of malspam pushing Dridex in the past few months: (1) a
phishing email with an Excel spreadsheet attachment, and (2) a phishing email with a link to a
message to download an Excel spreadsheet.

Figure 3. Infection chain for phishing emails linked to a message to download an Excel spreadsheet.
Unit 42 has published multiple articles over the past few years using the tag “Dridex.”
From the newly registered phishing URLs, Unit 42 observed that a couple of phishing URLs with travelrelated keywords – “airlines” and “vacation” – were used by Dridex in 2021. These URLs are:

retrieve Dridex, in addition to soleravacation[.]net/wp-content/plugins/mojo-marketplace-wp-plugin-isbroke/inc/cli/mxq6awnfhnmadd2.php.

Abuse of Firebase by Threat Actors
Threat actors have targeted multiple organizations within the travel industry and have used Firebase to
host phishing pages to either target employees working in the travel industry or customers. Some of
the organizations that have been targeted by Firebase-hosted web applications include an online
marketplace for vacation rentals, upscale hotel chains, resort management companies and airline
companies such as Tui.
As mentioned above, Firebase is backed by Google and supports developers of mobile or web
applications, allowing them to store content in Google Cloud Storage. Unit 42 observed attackers
taking advantage of the inherent legitimacy of the Google Firebase domain to deceive targets and to
bypass security filters that block domains and files that are known to be malicious. Once Unit 42
notified Google, it immediately removed and blocked these phishing URLs to prevent further threat
actor activity.
A sample of phishing URLs hosted on Firebase include:

How Attackers Use the Data Gathered Through Phishing
Cybercriminals often want to monetize any “data” that they acquire through attacks, and data gathered
about travelers or organizations operating in the travel sector is no different. We have observed that
threat actors monetize data by selling stolen account credentials, stolen customer data or stolen
payment information.
During the pandemic, Unit 42 researchers noticed the supply for travel-themed services and products
in underground markets drastically decreased (see Figure 5), possibly due to the global travel
restrictions. However, we expect that both supply and demand will increase as the world reopens for
travel.

Figure 5. Travel-themed products and services listed in underground marketplaces, October 2019March 2021. (Data for later months not available.)

Stolen Account Credentials
There are two main reasons criminals are attracted by data sets containing stolen usernames, emails
and passwords. First, they give criminals access to victims’ mileage or hotel points, which can easily be
resold for profit. Second, the credentials can easily be used for compromising and taking over victims’
accounts on other platforms, if the same credentials were used. With all the potential financial gains

8/12

from stolen login credentials, the strong demand in underground marketplaces encourages threat
actors to actively acquire this data through social engineering, brute-forcing or exploiting vulnerable
systems.

Stolen Customer Data
Organizations in the travel industry have access to a wealth of data, including personally identifiable
information (PII), payment information and the contact information of customers. In the recent SITA
passenger service system attack, 4.5 million global data subjects were compromised. While
researchers attributed the attack to APT41, it was observed that financially motivated criminals also
showed interest in this data.
There are three possible ways cybercriminals can abuse this type of data.
1. Identity theft: Using stolen individual information collected from website A to create new
accounts on website B. Because victims are not aware of these accounts on website B, they are
less likely to be notified until later.
2. Reconnaissance: Using the information for reconnaissance and setting the stage for spear
phishing attacks.
3. Resale of data: Data can easily be resold to other criminals, fraudsters or illicit marketing service
providers for further abuse.

Stolen Payment Information
Cybercriminals have been offering a “shadow travel agency” service for years. They reach out to
individual travelers through various social media or instant messaging platforms such as Telegram,
providing flight bookings, hotel reservations, car rentals, car rides and sightseeing tours with heavily
discounted prices. While travelers transfer clean money to the “shadow travel agency,” the “shadow
travel agency” pays the actual service providers such as hotels or airlines with stolen payment
information. Due to the time gap in payment processing, service providers only realize they have been
defrauded when they see the disputed card transactions or chargebacks weeks or months later.
There are three groups of victims in this scenario. The first victim group is the payment information
owners and stolen credit card holders. The second victim group is the travelers who were unknowingly
a part of the money laundering process, giving cybercriminals opportunities to cash out the stolen
payment information they previously collected. Travel industry organizations are considered the third
victim group; they are the most impacted in this scheme. Not only did they fail to profit from the
products and services they provided, but they also had to cover the costs and chargeback penalties, as
well as addressing the reputational impacts of the crime.

Conclusion
The travel industry and international travelers have been long-term targets for cybercriminals, suffering
financial and reputational damage. Threat actors not only sell fabricated information but also stolen
information that they gather through phishing attacks. During the pandemic, we noticed that travelthemed products and services offered by cybercriminals in underground marketplaces decreased
significantly, possibly due to low demand. However, as travel resumes, we expect travelers and the
travel industry to be targeted again due to the high profitability associated with this data. Therefore, it is
important to be aware of phishing campaigns.
Best practices to protect yourself and your organization from phishing attacks include:
For individuals:
Exercise caution when clicking on any links or attachments contained in suspicious emails,
especially those relating to one’s account settings or personal information, or otherwise trying to
convey a sense of urgency.
Verify the sender’s address for any suspicious emails in your inbox.
Double-check the URL and security certificate of each website before inputting your login
credentials.
Report suspected phishing attempts.
For organizations:
Implement security awareness training to improve employees’ ability to identify fraudulent emails.
Regularly back up your organization’s data as a defense against ransomware attacks initiated via
phishing emails.
Enforce multi-factor authentication on all business-related logins as an added layer of security.
