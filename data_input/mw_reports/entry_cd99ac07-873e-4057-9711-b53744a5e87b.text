[Note: In this two-part blog series, we expose a modern malware infrastructure and provide
guidance for protecting against the wide range of threats it enables. Part 1 covers the
evolution of the threat, how it spreads, and how it impacts organizations. Part 2 is a deep
dive on the attacker behavior and will provide investigation guidance.]
Combating and preventing today’s threats to enterprises require comprehensive protection
focused on addressing the full scope and impact of attacks. Anything that can gain access to
machines—even so-called commodity malware—can bring in more dangerous threats.
We’ve seen this in banking Trojans serving as entry point for ransomware and hands-onkeyboard attacks. LemonDuck, an actively updated and robust malware that’s primarily
known for its botnet and cryptocurrency mining objectives, followed the same trajectory when
it adopted more sophisticated behavior and escalated its operations. Today, beyond using
resources for its traditional bot and mining activities, LemonDuck steals credentials, removes
security controls, spreads via emails, moves laterally, and ultimately drops more tools for
human-operated activity.
LemonDuck’s threat to enterprises is also in the fact that it’s a cross-platform threat. It’s one
of a few documented bot malware families that targets Linux systems as well as Windows
devices. It uses a wide range of spreading mechanisms—phishing emails, exploits, USB
devices, brute force, among others—and it has shown that it can quickly take advantage of
news, events, or the release of new exploits to run effective campaigns. For example, in
2020, it was observed using COVID-19-themed lures in email attacks. In 2021, it exploited
newly patched Exchange Server vulnerabilities to gain access to outdated systems.
This threat, however, does not just limit itself to new or popular vulnerabilities. It continues to
use older vulnerabilities, which benefit the attackers at times when focus shifts to patching a
popular vulnerability rather than investigating compromise. Notably, LemonDuck removes
other attackers from a compromised device by getting rid of competing malware and
preventing any new infections by patching the same vulnerabilities it used to gain access.
In the early years, LemonDuck targeted China heavily, but its operations have since
expanded to include many other countries, focusing on the manufacturing and IoT sectors.
Today, LemonDuck impacts a very large geographic range, with the United States, Russia,
China, Germany, the United Kingdom, India, Korea, Canada, France, and Vietnam seeing
the most encounters.

Figure 1. Global distribution of LemonDuck botnet activity
In 2021, LemonDuck campaigns started using more diversified command and control (C2)
infrastructure and tools. This update supported the marked increase in hands-on-keyboard
actions post-breach, which varied depending on the perceived value of compromised
devices to the attackers. Despite all these upgrades, however, LemonDuck still utilizes C2s,
functions, script structures, and variable names for far longer than the average malware. This
is likely due to its use of bulletproof hosting providers such as Epik Holdings, which are
unlikely to take any part of the LemonDuck infrastructure offline even when reported for
malicious actions, allowing LemonDuck to persist and continue to be a threat.
In-depth research into malware infrastructures of various sizes and operations provides
invaluable insight into the breadth of threats that organizations face today. In the case of
LemonDuck, the threat is cross-platform, persistent, and constantly evolving. Research like
this emphasizes the importance of having comprehensive visibility into the wide range of
threats, as well as the ability to correlate simple, disparate activity such as coin mining to
more dangerous adversarial attacks.

LemonDuck and LemonCat infrastructure
The earliest documentation of LemonDuck was from its cryptocurrency campaigns in May
2019. These campaigns included PowerShell scripts that employed additional scripts kicked
off by a scheduled task. The task was used to bring in the PCASTLE tool to achieve a couple
of goals: abuse the EternalBlue SMB exploit, as well as use brute force or pass-the-hash to
move laterally and begin the operation again. Many of these behaviors are still observed in
LemondDuck campaigns today.

2/9

LemonDuck is named after the variable “Lemon_Duck” in one of the said PowerShell scripts.
The variable is often used as the user agent, in conjunction with assigned numbers, for
infected devices. The format used two sets of alphabetical characters separated by dashes,
for example: “User-Agent: Lemon-Duck-[A-Z]-[A-Z]”. The term still appears in PowerShell
scripts, as well as in many of the execution scripts, specifically in a function called SIEX,
which is used to assign a unique user-agent during botnet connection in attacks as recently
as June 2021.
LemonDuck frequently utilizes open-source material built off of resources also used by other
botnets, so there are many components of this threat that would seem familiar. Microsoft
researchers are aware of two distinct operating structures, which both use the LemonDuck
malware but are potentially operated by two different entities for separate goals.
The first, which we call the “Duck” infrastructure, uses historical infrastructures discussed in
this report. It is highly consistent in running campaigns and performs limited follow-on
activities. This infrastructure is seldom seen in conjunction with edge device compromise as
an infection method, and is more likely to have random display names for its C2 sites, and is
always observed utilizing “Lemon_Duck” explicitly in script.
The second infrastructure, which we call “Cat” infrastructure—for primarily using two
domains with the word “cat” in them (sqlnetcat[.]com, netcatkit[.]com)—emerged in January
2021. It was used in attacks exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server. Today,
the Cat infrastructure is used in attacks that typically result in backdoor installation, credential
and data theft, and malware delivery. It is often seen delivering the malware Ramnit.
Sample Duck domains
cdnimages[.]xyz
bb3u9[.]com
zz3r0[.]com
pp6r1[.]com
amynx[.]com
ackng[.]com
hwqloan[.]com
js88[.]ag
zer9g[.]com
b69kq[.]com

Sample Cat domains
sqlnetcat[.]com
netcatkit[.]com
down[.]sqlnetcat[.]com

The Duck and Cat infrastructures use similar subdomains, and they use the same task
names, such as “blackball”. Both infrastructures also utilize the same packaged components
hosted on similar or identical sites for their mining, lateral movement, and competitionremoval scripts, as well as many of the same function calls.

3/9

The fact that the Cat infrastructure is used for more dangerous campaigns does not
deprioritize malware infections from the Duck infrastructure. Instead, this intelligence adds
important context for understanding this threat: the same set of tools, access, and methods
can be re-used at dynamic intervals, to greater impact. Despite common implications that
cryptocurrency miners are less threatening than other malware, its core functionality mirrors
non-monetized software, making any botnet infection worthy of prioritization.

Initial access
LemonDuck spreads in a variety of ways, but the two main methods are (1) compromises
that are either edge-initiated or facilitated by bot implants moving laterally within an
organization, or (2) bot-initiated email campaigns.
LemonDuck acts as a loader for many other follow-on activities, but one if its main functions
is to spread by compromising other systems. Since its first appearance, the LemonDuck
operators have leveraged scans against both Windows and Linux devices for open or weakly
authenticated SMB, Exchange, SQL, Hadoop, REDIS, RDP, or other edge devices that might
be vulnerable to password spray or application vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-0144
(EternalBlue), CVE-2017-8464 (LNK RCE), CVE-2019-0708 (BlueKeep), CVE-2020-0796
(SMBGhost), CVE-2021-26855 (ProxyLogon), CVE-2021-26857 (ProxyLogon), CVE-202126858 (ProxyLogon), and CVE-2021-27065 (ProxyLogon).

4/9

Once inside a system with an Outlook mailbox, as part of its normal exploitation behavior,
LemonDuck attempts to run a script that utilizes the credentials present on the device. The
script instructs the mailbox to send copies of a phishing message with preset messages and
attachments to all contacts.
Because of this method of contact messaging, security controls that rely on determining if an
email is sent from a suspicious sender don’t apply. This means that email security policies
that reduce scanning or coverage for internal mail need to be re-evaluated, as sending
emails through contact scraping is very effective at bypassing email controls.
From mid-2020 to March 2021, LemonDuck’s email subjects and body content have
remained static, as have the attachment names and formats. These attachment names and
formats have changed very little from similar campaigns that occurred in early 2020.
Sample email subjects
The Truth of COVID19
COVID-19 nCov
Special info WHO
HALTH
ADVISORY:CORONA
VIRUS
WTF
What the fcuk
good bye
farewell letter
broken file
This is your order?

Sample email body content
Virus actually comes from United States of America
very important infomation for Covid-19
see attached document for your action and discretion.
the outbreak of CORONA VIRUS is cause of concern
especially where forign personal have recently arrived
or will be arriving at various intt in near future.
what’s wrong with you?are you out of your mind!!!!!
are you out of your mind!!!!!what ‘s wrong with you?
good bye, keep in touch
can you help me to fix the file,i can’t read it
file is brokened, i can’t open it

The attachment used for these lures is one of three types: .doc, .js, or a .zip containing a .js
file. Whatever the type, the file is named “readme”. Occasionally, all three types are present
in the same email.

Figure 3. Sample email
While the JavaScript is detected by many security vendors, it might be classified with generic
detection names. It could be valuable for organizations to sanitize JavaScript or VBScript
executing or calling prompts (such as PowerShell) directly from mail downloads through
solutions such as custom detection rules.
Since LemonDuck began operating, the .zip to .js file execution method is the most common.
The JavaScript has replaced the scheduled task that LemonDuck previously used to kickstart
the PowerShell script. This PowerShell script has looked very similar throughout 2020 and
2021, with minor changes depending on the version, indicating continued development.
Below is a comparison of changes from the most recent iterations of the email-delivered
downloads and those from April of 2020.

6/9

After the emails are sent, the inbox is cleaned to remove traces of these mails. This method
of self-spreading is attempted on any affected device that has a mailbox, regardless of
whether it is an Exchange server.
Other common methods of infection include movement within the compromised environment,
as well as through USB and connected drives. These processes are often kicked off
automatically and have occurred consistently throughout the entirety of LemonDuck’s
operation.
These methods run as a series of C# scripts that gather available drives for infection. They
also create a running list of drives that are already infected based on whether it finds the
threat already installed. Once checked against the running list of infected drives, these
scripts attempt to create a set of hidden files in the home directory, including a copy of
readme.js. Any device that has been affected by the LemonDuck implants at any time could
have had any number of drives attached to it that are compromised in this manner. This
makes this behavior a possible entry vector for additional attacks.
