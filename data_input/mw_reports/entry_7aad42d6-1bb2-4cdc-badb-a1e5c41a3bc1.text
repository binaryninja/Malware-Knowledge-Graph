This ruleset enables Suricata to detect the handshake of certain Winnti variants as seen in
the wild in 2016/2017.

Winnti
Winnti is a malware that is used by some APT groups.
It has been used since at least 2013 and has evolved over time. You can find some
information here

Handshake
The driver component of Winnti (aka "NdisReroute") is able to reroute network traffic from
ports that are already occupied by legit applications to the malware's userspace component.

1/2

The first packet of a TCP stream signals the driver that the stream shall be rerouted. I call
such a packet a "Winnti HELO". It is exactly 16 bytes long and the bytes match the following
relation:
Winnti handshake Example:
dw0
5B 44 B4 91

dw1
xx xx xx xx

5B 44 B4 91

==

dw2
31 18 30 59

dw3
[84 C8] {6A 5C}

31 18 30 59 ^ {6A 5C} [84 C8]

dw0 calculated from dw2 and dw3
dw1 random but not zero. Only seen timestamps in here but any value works.
dw2 random but not zero
dw3 random but not zero

Installation
Copy the rules and lua files to your suricata rules directory
cp winnti.lua
/etc/suricata/rules/
cp winnti.rules /etc/suricata/rules/

activate the rules by adding them to suricata.yaml
