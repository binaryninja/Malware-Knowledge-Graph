Trickbot Expands Global Targets Beyond Banks and Payment
Processors to CRMs

August 1, 2017

The financial trojan TrickBot has been updating its campaigns and targets since F5 malware researchers started
following it in September 2016. This is expected behavior because attackers need to continually update their
targets and methods to evade detection. Previously, TrickBot, the successor to Dyre, targeted financial institutions
in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. TrickBot’s May 2017 campaigns targeted banks in the UK,
Australia, US, Canada, New Zealand, Ireland, France, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Bulgaria, India,
Singapore, and Hong Kong.
In the 26 TrickBot configurations F5 researchers analyzed that were active in May 2017, targets expanded beyond
banks to include two payment processing providers and two Customer Relationship Management (CRM) SaaS
providers. The fact that payment processors were targets was a notable change that we also observed in Marcher,
an Android banking trojan in March of 2017. It appears now that CRMs are a new target of attackers; is it because
of their potential for collecting valuable user data that could enhance phishing campaigns?
What’s also notable (and expected) is that all command and control (C&C) servers tied to the most recent
campaigns reside within web hosting provider networks and were communicating with their infected hosts over port
443. We know attackers hide their exploits in encrypted traffic; this is just another point of reference to prove it is a
consistent and common method being used. Additionally, none of the C&Cs we observed in May 2017 were the
same C&Cs we tracked in late 2016.
May 2017 Campaigns
This analysis focuses on the activities of two separate campaigns of different sizes identified in the 26
configurations analyzed, versions “1000018” and “1000019.” The smaller campaign detected included 210 URL
targets focused on banks in Australia, UK, Canada, New Zealand, Singapore, India, and Ireland, and a payment

processor in the US. The larger campaign detected included 257 URLs for banks in the UK, Australia, US, Canada,
Ireland, France, Germany, Switzerland, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, and Bulgaria. The same US payment
processor was targeted across both campaigns, however, the CRM targets only appeared in the second campaign.

TrickBot May Targets by Industry and Country
When looking at TrickBot’s URL targets, we attributed the country target based on the country code in the URL
rather than the global headquarters of the targeted business. For instance, https://www.citibank.com.sg is attributed
to Singapore, and https://online.citi.eu/GBIPB is attributed to the UK, even though CitiBank is headquartered in the
US. (Refer to Appendix A for specific targets by country.)
The smaller campaign focused on targeting banks (83% of URL targets) in Australia, UK, Canada, New Zealand
and Singapore, and a payment processor (PayPal) attributed to the US (although PayPal users are global).

The map in Figure 3 shows the number of URLs targeted by country in the smaller campaign. All targets in every
country except the US were banks. No US banks were targeted in this campaign, only the payment processor,
PayPal. The 35 unique PayPal URLs targeted were the exact same URLs targeted in both campaigns.

Figure 4: Unique URLs to unique businesses in the smaller campaign

The larger campaign expanded its scope of targeted banking URLs and payment processors by adding one new
payment processor URL in the UK and introducing CRMs as new targets. The specific CRMs targeted were
Salesforce.com and an auto sales CRM developed by Reynolds & Reynolds in the US.

Figure 5: URL targets by industry in the larger campaign
The larger campaign was mainly focused on banks in the UK (47% of targets, up from 18% in the smaller
campaign), followed by Australia, then the US. All Australian targets were banks again. PayPal was the leading US
target (exactly the same PayPal URLs in both campaigns), followed by 9 other US banks that were not targeted in
the smaller campaign, and with the addition of new CRM providers. Additional European companies were targeted
in the larger campaign, including banks in France, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Bulgaria. A bank in
Hong Kong was the new Asia target in this campaign, however, the banking targets in Singapore and India from the
smaller campaign were not included.

C&C Servers in Europe

5/13

When analyzing the two campaigns, six C&C IP addresses were identified, all of which exist within European web
hosting provider networks. As shown in the table below, three of the six are operated by hosting firms in Asia that
use these European web hosting companies’ services. All of them used port 443 / HTTPS as a connection method
from the infected machine back to the C&C host, a method commonly used by malware authors to evade detection
from network security devices that don’t inspect encrypted traffic.

Conclusion
It seems the success of TrickBot thus far has influenced the authors to not only repeat their previous target list of
banks from previous campaigns but to expand those targets to include new banks globally as well as CRM
providers. The fact that C&C servers in these two most recent campaigns reside within web hosting companies is
also significant, along with the fact that the C&C servers were different from those used in previous campaigns.
Given the changes we’ve witnessed with each successive campaign, F5 Labs researchers expect to see further
evolution in both the targets and methods used by TrickBot authors, and we will continue to monitor and report on
this evolving threat. TrickBot’s consistent initial attack pattern is to use email spam campaigns, so users are
advised not to open suspicious files received by email.
