A new ransomware has been found in the wild that is currently undetected by antivirus
engines on public scanning platforms. Its name is NextCry due to the extension appended to
encrypted files and that it targets clients of the NextCloud file sync and share service.
The malware targets Nextcloud instances and for the time being there is no free decryption
tool available for victims.

Zero detection
xact64, a Nextcloud user, posted on the BleepingComputer forum some details about the
malware in an attempt to find a way to decrypt personal files.
Although his system was backed up, the synchronization process had started to update files
on a laptop with their encrypted version on the server. He took action the moment he saw the
files renamed but some of them still got processed by NextCry, otherwise known as NextCry.

1/5

“I realized immediately that my server got hacked and those files got encrypted. The first
thing I did was pull the server to limit the damage that was being done (only 50% of my files
got encrypted)” - xact64
Looking at the malware binary, Michael Gillespie said that the threat seems new and pointed
out the NextCry ransomware uses Base64 to encode the file names. The odd part is that an
encrypted file's content is also encoded this way, after first being encrypted.
The malware has not been submitted to the ID Ransomware service before but some details
are available.
BleepingComputer discovered that NextCry is a Python script compiled in a Linux ELF binary
using pyInstaller. At the moment of writing, not one antivirus engine on the VirusTotal
scanning platform detects it.

Nexcloud servers targeted
The ransom note is in a file named “READ_FOR_DECRYPT” stating that the data is
encrypted with the AES algorithm with a 256-bit key. Gillespie confirmed that AES-256 is
used and that the key is encrypted with an RSA-2048 public key embedded in the malware
code.

In the analyzed sample the ransom demanded is BTC 0.025, which converts to about $210
at the moment of writing. A bitcoin wallet is provided but no transactions have been recorded
until now.

After another BleepingComputer member named shuum successfully extracted the compiled
Python script, BleepingComputer could clearly see that this ransomware specifically targets
NextCloud services.
When executed, the ransomware will first find the victim's NextCloud file share and sync data
directory by reading the service's config.php file. It will then delete some folders that could be
used to restore files and then encrypts all the files in the data directory.

More than one case spotted
Another Nexcloud user named Alex posted on the platform’s support page about being hit by
NextCry ransomware. They say that access to their instance had been locked via SSH and
ran the latest version of the software, suggesting that some vulnerability was exploited to get
in.
In a conversation with BleepingComputer xact64 said that their Nextcloud installation runs on
an old Linux computer with NGINX. This detail may provide the answer to how the attacker
was able to get access.
“I have my own linux server (an old thin client I gave a second life) with nginx reverse-proxy”
- xact64
On October 24, Nextcloud released an urgent alert about a remote code execution
vulnerability that impacts the default Nextcloud NGINX configuration.

4/5

Tracked as CVE-2019-11043, the flaw is in the PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager)
component, included by some hosting providers like Nextcloud in their default setup. A public
exploit exists and has been leveraged to compromised servers.
Nextcloud’s recommendation for administrators is to upgrade their PHP packages and
NGINX configuration file to the latest version.
A representative from Nextcloud told BleepingComputer that they are currently investigating
the incidents and will provide more information as it becomes available.
Update 11/18/19: NextCloud has told BleepingComputer that after conducting an
investigation they are confident that the attacker is exploiting the PHP -FPM vulnerability that
they issued an advisory on.
We've been looking into the reports on the forum and source of the virus. We are confident
that the attack vector was the nginx+php-fpm security issue that hit the web some time ago.
While it was not an issue in Nextcloud itself, we informed our users through all channels we
had available, including a direct notification to Nextcloud servers. This likely explains why so
few servers were impacted out of the hundreds of thousands of Nextcloud servers on the
web.
BleepingComputer advises users to upgrade to PHP 7.3.11 or PHP 7.2.24, depending on
development branch being used, to fix this vulnerability.
