Pony Stealer Malware
knowbe4.com/pony-stealer

Pony Stealer is a password stealer that can decrypt or unlock passwords for over 110
different applications including VPN, FTP, email, instant messaging, web browsers and much
more. Pony Stealer is very dangerous and once it infects a PC it will turn the device into a
botnet, allowing it to use the PCs it infects to infect other PCs.

Pony Stealer, which is tied closely to Reveton worm, is also well-known for spreading
malware, thanks to an e-mail campaign that was started in late 2014. The e-mail is
supposedly sent from the shipping company Maersk Line. The writer of this e-mail informs
potential victims that they have an overdue invoice from an account with the company. The
victims are then provided with a link to a PDF download so they can download the overdue
invoice and then pay for what they owe. Toward the end of the e-mail, victims are provided
with phone numbers for a “sales representative” and the Maersk customer service line—and
both of these phone numbers have a Vietnamese area code. In an effort to make the e-mail
seem more legitimate, the writer provides the URL of Maersk’s official website.
A quick inspection would reveal that, while Maersk does have a way to contact their
Vietnamese branch, the phone number on their official website is completely different from
the ones provided in the e-mail. Furthermore, in January 2014, Maersk warned their
customers about the fraud, instructing them not to click the suspicious links in the e-mails
and not to provide anyone with security information like account passwords.
