Proofpoint stands for the defense of peace and human rights, and a diplomatic resolution to
the fighting in Ukraine. We continue to monitor the activity of threat actors actively involved
with, seeking to influence, or trying to profit from the conflict, and are releasing these findings
continuously for the benefit of defenders globally.

and updating our blog as new information comes in.
