BlackBerry Prevents: Threat Actor Group TA575 and
Dridex Malware

The BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team

The BlackBerry Research & Intelligence team has been tracking and monitoring Cobalt
Strike team servers associated with the threat actor TA575, a financially motivated
cybercrime group and prolific Dridex affiliate. They are well-known for conducting mass spam
campaigns that use malicious document lures to deliver malware such as Dridex, Qakbot,
and WastedLocker.
Since February 2021, TA575 has deployed more than 50 Cobalt Strike team servers. These
servers use unique values in their configurations that have allowed BlackBerry researchers
to identify disparate infrastructure that had previously been flying under the radar.
Portions of this infrastructure have been used by thousands of Cobalt Strike “Beacons” and
malicious document stagers across several distinct malspam campaigns. In more recent
offensives, such as the Fake Kaseya VSA phishing campaign first reported by Trustwave in
early July, the team server infrastructure was used for staging further Dridex payloads.
BlackBerry Cyber Suite and BlackBerry Guard stop these attacks.
