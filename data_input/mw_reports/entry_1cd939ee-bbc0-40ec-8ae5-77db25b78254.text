Pro-PRC “HaiEnergy” Information Operations Campaign
Leverages Infrastructure from Public Relations Firm to
Disseminate Content on Inauthentic News Sites
mandiant.com/resources/pro-prc-information-operations-campaign-haienergy

Mandiant has identified an ongoing information operations (IO) campaign leveraging a
network of at least 72 suspected inauthentic news sites and a number of suspected
inauthentic social media assets to disseminate content strategically aligned with the political
interests of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). The sites present themselves primarily as
independent news outlets from different regions across the world and publish content in 11
languages (see Appendix). Based on technical indicators we detail in this blog, we believe
these sites are linked to Shanghai Haixun Technology Co., Ltd (上海海讯社科技有限公司), a
Chinese public relations (PR) firm (referred to hereafter as “Haixun”).
Narratives promoted by the campaign criticize the U.S. and its allies, attempt to reshape the
international image of Xinjiang due to mounting international scrutiny, and express support
for the reform of Hong Kong’s electoral system—a change which gave the PRC more power
over vetting local candidates. In addition to these broader themes, the campaign leveraged
fabricated content designed to discredit opponents who have been critical of the Chinese
Government, including Chinese businessman Guo Wengui (Miles Kwok) and German
anthropologist Adrian Zenz—known for his research on Xinjiang—and China’s reported
genocide against the Uyghur population.

Given the distinctive tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by this campaign,
we are classifying this activity set as its own campaign, which we have dubbed
“HaiEnergy”—stemming from the campaign’s use of infrastructure attributed to Haixun and
services advertised by the PR firm as “positive energy packages.” Notably, the term “positive
energy” (正能量) is an important term in the Xi Jinping era that refers to messages positively
portraying the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the Chinese Government, and its policies.
Despite the capabilities and global reach of this campaign, there is at least some evidence to
suggest that HaiEnergy failed to generate substantial engagement outside of the inauthentic
amplification that we have identified—a limitation we also noted in our recent public reporting
on DRAGONBRIDGE. We find the campaign’s use of infrastructure linked to Haixun to be
more interesting, as it is suggestive of recent trends surrounding the outsourcing of IO to
third parties, which can make IO more accessible and help obfuscate the identities of an
actor.

Infrastructure Linked to Shanghai Haixun Technology Co., Ltd (上海
海讯社科技有限公司)
Based on information from public descriptions of the company’s services, Haixun offers
content creation and marketing services in at least 40 different languages in over 100
countries. Among their most notable offerings are the “Europe and U.S. Positive Energy”
package, which includes content creation ostensibly geared towards English-speaking
audiences, and the “Positive Energy Project Edition,” which focuses on the production of
tailor-made videos, promotion of custom content through “high-quality media resources,” and
campaign impact monitoring (Figure 1).

While we do not currently have sufficient evidence to determine the extent to which Haixun is
involved in, or even aware of HaiEnergy, our analysis indicates that the campaign has at
least leveraged services and infrastructure belonging to Haixun to host and distribute
content. In total, we identified 72 websites (59 domains and 13 subdomains) hosted by
Haixun, which were used to target audiences in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and
Asia.

3/19

Sites attributed to HaiEnergy all display images and videos that are hosted on the
server 02100.vip, which is registered by Haixun (Figure 2). Based on infrastructure
overlap, we identified two additional domains (haixunpr.com and haixunpr.org)—
Chinese- and English-language sites describing Haixun’s services—that have resolved
to the same IP address and leveraged content from 02100.vip.
We observed multiple inauthentic news sites we attribute to “HaiEnergy” listed in a
downloadable spreadsheet hosted at haixunpr.org. The spreadsheet features Chinese
and Russian text and appears to be a distribution list for content (Figure 3). We note
that the spreadsheet is no longer available to download as of the date of this
publication.

the sites we judge to be part of the network in Russian and Chinese
Websites Exhibit Signs of Coordination
To date, HaiEnergy has exclusively leveraged Haixun infrastructure to host websites. These
websites possess a number of similarities and exhibit notable signs of coordination,
including:
Nearly all sites, including those presenting themselves as English-language U.S. news
outlets, are built with a Chinese-language HTML template (Figure 4).
Several of the websites that include both a domain and subdomain present themselves
as different, independent sites. For example, the domain trademarksdaily.com presents
itself as the English-language site “TMK Daily,” whereas the subdomain
automobile.tradesmarksdaily.com presents itself as “Focus on Russia” and contains
Russian-language content (Figure 5).
Many of the sites link directly to other sites in the network, typically at the bottom of
their pages. Additionally, sites commonly link to other news outlets related to their
stated regional focus.

5/19

Identical political and apolitical articles are often published across multiple websites,
including articles appropriated from other sources (e.g., Chinese and Russian statecontrolled media outlets).

Campaign Leverages Social Media Assets from Sites and Author Personas
to Disseminate Content
The campaign also leveraged a small number of social media accounts across multiple
platforms to disseminate content. Observed assets included personas presented as being
affiliated with HaiEnergy’s inauthentic news sites, author personas allegedly responsible for
the content itself, and accounts that promote campaign content, but do not self-affiliate with

7/19

the sites. In some cases, accounts that we identified and assessed to be part of the
campaign featured bios that displayed the text “I do paid promos,” raising the possibility that
the pro-PRC content may have been commissioned.
Notably, many of the sites we identified have published articles with author bylines directly
linking to Facebook accounts that we judge to be leveraged in this campaign. For example,
the site inspectnews.com published content by an author listed as “Julian Sontagg,” which
directly links to the Facebook account “I trust in memes” (@TrustingMemes) in Sontagg’s
byline (Figure 6).

Pro-PRC Content and Narratives Promoted by Campaign Assets
Content promoted by the campaign includes efforts to reshape the international image of
Xinjiang, criticism of the U.S. and its allies, and attempts to discredit critics of the PRC
government.

9/19

Efforts to Reshape International Image of Xinjiang
We observed efforts to smear anthropologist Adrian Zenz—known for his research on
Xinjiang and China’s reported genocide against the Uyghur population—through website
articles and social media posts featuring what we suspect to be at least three fabricated
letters based on obvious grammatical errors and typos (Figure 7).
A now-suspended Twitter account belonging to a suspected inauthentic persona
“Jonas Drosten” (@Jonas_drosten), posted a tweet containing images of three letters.
The tweet and one of the letters alleged that Zenz received financial support from U.S.
Senator Marco Rubio and former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon (Figure
7). The other two letters implied that the financial support came from grants awarded to
Zenz from the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation in 2020 and 2021.
We observed this persona mentioned in an article published by the Chinese stateaffiliated media outlet China Daily on May 24, 2022 titled “Rumormongers’ agenda in
fabricating lies about Xinjiang,” which claimed that Zenz received funds illicitly from an
unknown source connected to former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon to
“fabricate Xinjiang stories.” Several websites and other social media accounts in this
campaign promoted the same letters and mentioned the Jonas Drosten Twitter
persona.

Content Critical of the U.S. and its Allies
Assets in this campaign promoted various narratives critical of the U.S. and its allies in
different languages, including:
On Aug. 1, several sites published articles critical of U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi
in response to reports that she may visit Taiwan in early August. The articles assert that
Pelosi should "stay away from Taiwan" and highlight perceived tarnished relations
between the U.S. and Taiwan.
11/19

On June 30, six days after the U.S. Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade,
we observed an English-language article purportedly by an author claiming to be an
American woman living outside the U.S., which claimed that protesters against the
decision had been met with violence by U.S. law enforcement and U.S. civilians that
supported the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade (Figure 8).
A Ukrainian-language article claimed that experiments run in alleged U.S. biolabs in
Ukraine have resulted in numerous Ukrainian deaths.
An article published on several sites, including one purporting to be a Taiwanese news
outlet, claimed that former U.S. government official Mike Pompeo’s March 2022 visit to
Taiwan was motivated by money and his alleged desire to run for U.S. president in
2024. Additionally, it portrayed the U.S. as an unreliable ally, arguing that Taiwan
should not expect the U.S. to send troops to defend it from a potential invasion by
China.

Attacks on Critics of PRC Government and Support for Hong Kong Reform
The campaign promoted content attacking opponents of the PRC Government and content in
support of Hong Kong’s reformed electoral system in 2021 that gave the PRC more power
over vetting candidates.

12/19

Some of the sites promoted content critical of Chinese virologist Dr. Yan Limeng and
claimed that she is the cause of the Asian hate crimes in the U.S., as well as content
condemning Chinese businessman Guo Wengui.
Other sites promoted content critical of Falun Gong founder Li Hongzhi, including
claims that Falun Gong is a cult that has brainwashed and killed many people. They
also asserted that Li Hongzhi is a fraud and liar.
Other articles praised the new electoral system in Hong Kong, claiming that it is widely
supported by the public, including on Chinese- and Arabic-language news sites (Figure
9).

Overlaps and Differences Between HaiEnergy and DRAGONBRIDGE
We currently track HaiEnergy and DRAGONBRIDGE as separate campaigns due to
differences in campaign TTPs. We note though, that both campaigns promote similar
narratives, such as those alleging the existence of U.S.-funded biolabs globally, content
pertaining to China's alleged treatment of Uyghurs, and negative messaging surrounding
PRC opponents such as Guo Wengui. Both campaigns also engage in the spam-like
promotion of apolitical content. It is possible that these overlaps could be a result of shared
tasking or group overlap, but we do not have evidence to make an assessment.
DRAGONBRIDGE has typically leveraged thousands of social media and forum
accounts across various authentic platforms to post comments, videos, and photos.

13/19

HaiEnergy primarily leverages a network of inauthentic websites to disseminate
content, alongside a small set of seemingly inauthentic accounts that promote material
and, in some cases, appear to author content on certain sites.
We have not observed overlapping social media accounts, forums, websites or
infrastructure. Specifically, known DRAGONBRIDGE assets have not promoted content
from HaiEnergy's inauthentic news sites.

Outlook
We note that despite the capabilities and global reach advertised by Haixun, there is at least
some evidence to suggest HaiEnergy failed to generate substantial engagement. Most
notably, despite a significantly large number of followers, the political posts promoted by
inauthentic accounts we attribute to this campaign failed to gain much traction outside of the
campaign itself. This lack of amplification from external sources, not unlike what we typically
observed with DRAGONBRIDGE, limited the campaigns’ ability to breakout, essentially
forming an echo chamber.
Arguably more interesting than assessing the campaign’s possible impact is its use of
infrastructure linked to Haixun, an observation which is suggestive of recent trends
surrounding the continued outsourcing of IO to third parties—"IO for hire.” Notably, in mid2021, Meta testified about an increase in the use of such firms, which have been used to
lower the barrier to entry for some threat actors and to obfuscate the identities of more
sophisticated ones.
