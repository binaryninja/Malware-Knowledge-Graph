Bizarro is yet another banking Trojan family originating from Brazil that is now found in other
regions of the world. We have seen users being targeted in Spain, Portugal, France and
Italy. Attempts have now been made to steal credentials from customers of 70 banks
from different European and South American countries. Following in the footsteps of
Tetrade, Bizarro is using affiliates or recruiting money mules to operationalize their attacks,
cashing out or simply to helping with transfers. In this article we analyse the technical
features of the Trojan’s components, giving a detailed overview of obfuscation techniques,
the infection process and subsequent functions, as well as the social engineering tactics
used by the cybercriminals to convince their victims to give away their personal online
banking details.
Bizarro has x64 modules and is able to trick users into entering two-factor authentication
codes in fake pop-ups. It may also use social engineering to convince victims to download a
smartphone app. The group behind Bizzaro uses servers hosted on Azure and Amazon
(AWS) and compromised WordPress servers to store the malware and collect telemetry.

Bizarro is distributed via MSI packages downloaded by victims from links in spam emails.
Once launched, Bizarro downloads a ZIP archive from a compromised website. While writing
this article, we saw hacked WordPress, Amazon and Azure servers used for storing archives.
The MSI installer has two embedded links – which one is chosen depends on the victim’s
processor architecture.

Typical malicious message sent by Bizarro operators
The downloaded ZIP archive contains the following files:
A malicious DLL written in Delphi;
A legitimate executable that is an AutoHotkey script runner (in some samples AutoIt is
used instead of AutoHotkey);
A small script that calls an exported function from the malicious DLL.
The DLL exports a function that contains the malicious code. The malware developers have
used obfuscation to complicate code analysis. The code of the exported functions have been
removed by the protector. The bytes that belong to the exported functions are restored by the
DLL entry point function at runtime. This entry point function is heavily obfuscated. The tricks
used to complicate analysis consist of constant unfolding and junk code insertion. As for the
malware developers, they are constantly improving the protection of the binaries. In earlier
versions of Bizarro, only the entry point function was protected, while in more recent samples
the protector is also used to obscure calls of the imported API functions.

When Bizarro starts, it first kills all the browser processes to terminate any existing sessions
with online banking websites. When a user restarts the browsers, they will be forced to reenter the bank account credentials, which will be captured by the malware. Another step
Bizarro takes in order to get as many credentials as possible is to disable autocomplete in a
browser.
Bizarro gathers the following information about the system on which it is running:
Computer name;
Operating system version;
Default browser name;
Installed antivirus software name.
Bizarro uses the ‘Mozilla/4.0 (compatible;MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0′ user agent while
sending the POST request. This user agent has typos: there should be a space symbol after
the compatible; substring and the closing bracket is missing. Our research shows that this
mistake has not been fixed in the latest versions. After that, Bizarro creates an empty file in
the %userprofile% directory, thus marking the system as infected. The name of the file is the
name of the script runner (AutoIt or AutoHotKey) with the .jkl extension appended to it.
Having sent the data to the telemetry server, Bizarro initializes the screen capturing module.
It loads the magnification.dll library and gets the address of the deprecated
MagSetImageScalingCallback API function. With its help, the Trojan can capture the
screen of a user and also constantly monitor the system clipboard, looking for a Bitcoin
wallet address. If it finds one, it is replaced with a wallet belonging to the malware
developers.
The backdoor is the core component of Bizarro: it contains more than 100 commands and
allows the attackers to steal online banking account credentials. Most of the commands are
used to display fake pop-up messages to users. The core component of the backdoor
doesn’t start until Bizarro detects a connection to one of the hardcoded online banking
systems. The malware does this by enumerating all the windows, collecting their names.
Whitespace characters, letters with accents (such as ñ or á) and non-letter symbols such as
dashes are removed from the window name strings. If a window name matches one of the
hardcoded strings, the backdoor continues starting up.
The first thing the backdoor does is remove the DNS cache by executing the ipconfig
/flushdns command. This is done in order to prevent connecting to a blocked IP. After that,
the malware resolves the domain name to an IP address, creates a socket and binds it to the
resolved address. If the connection was successful, it creates the %userprofile%\bizarro.txt
file.

The Backdoor and its C2

3/13

The commands that Bizarro receives from its C2 can be divided into the following categories:
Commands that allow the C2 operators to get data about the victim and manage
the connection status
The <|PT|> command sends the environment information to the C2: Bizarro’s version,
OS name, computer name, Bizarro’s unique identifier, installed antivirus software and
the codename used for the bank that has been accessed. The codenames are bank
names written in leetspeak.
Commands that allow attackers to control the files located on the victim’s hard
drive
The <|DownloadFile|> command downloads files to the victim’s computer, while the
<|UploadFile|> command allows attackers to fetch files from the client machine. The
<|Folder|> and <|File|> commands allow the attackers to search for folders and files
which have a given mask.
Commands that allow attackers to control the user’s mouse and keyboard
The <|SuaykRJ|> command performs a left mouse button click at the designated
location. The <|SuaykJI|> command performs a double click at the given location,
while the <|IXjzwtR|> command performs a right mouse button click. The <|ztUjzwtR|>
command moves the mouse to a designated location. The syntax of these three
commands is <|command name|>x coordinate<|>y coordinate<<|.
Bizarro can also manipulate the user’s keyboard (what the user actually types) with the
help of the carmena command.
Commands that allow the attackers to control the backdoor operation, shut
down, restart or destroy the operating system and limit the functionality of
Windows
The LkingWajuGhkzwu command shuts the backdoor down, while the vkbAlcvtlY
command drops a BAT file in the working directory. The batch script is responsible for
deleting the malware from disk.
Commands that log keystrokes
Bizarro supports two commands that are responsible for keylogging. The COZUMEL
command starts the logging process, while the COZUMARIA command stops it.

Commands that perform social engineering attacks
These commands display various messages that trick users into giving attackers
access to the bank account. The type of messages displayed vary from simple
message boxes to well-designed windows with bank logs on them.
We will first describe commands that show Windows message boxes. The dkxqdpdv
command displays an error message with the text: “Los datos ingresados son
incorrectos, por favor intente nuevamente.” (English: “The data entered is incorrect,
please try again.”)

Bizarro shows a message telling the user to enter the requested data again
The vanessa command displays an error message which tells the user to enter confirmation
information. To further convince the user that all operations are legitimate, the malware
displays the RUT (Rol Único Tributario, a Chilean ID number) and the value that was
supplied earlier. The message has the following text:

Error message asking the user to enter a confirmation code
The LMAimwc command displays another error message. This time it tells the user that their
computer needs to be restarted in order to finish a security-related operation. Bizarro
displays the following text:

Error message telling the user that the operating system will be restarted
The most interesting messages that Bizarro displays are those that try to mimic online
banking systems. To display such messages, Bizarro needs to download a JPEG image that
contains the bank logo and instructions the victim needs to follow. These images are stored
in the user profile directory in an encrypted form. Before an image is used in a message, it is
decrypted with a multi-byte XOR algorithm. As the messages are downloaded from the C2
server, they can be found only on the victims’ machines.
The first type of custom messages that Bizarro may show are messages that freeze the
victim’s machine, thus allowing the attackers to gain some time. When a command to display
a message like this is received, the taskbar is hidden, the screen is greyed out and the
message itself is displayed. While the message is shown, the user is unable to close it or
open Task Manager. The message itself tells the user either that the system is compromised
and thus needs to be updated or that security and browser performance components are
being installed. This type of message also contains a progress bar that changes over time.
The images below show what these messages look like on the screens of victims, with
messages written in Spanish:

Bizarro blocking a bank login page and telling the user that security updates are being
installed
The following two messages try to convince the victim that their system is compromised. In
most of them, Bizarro tells the user not to worry about any transactions that occur during the
“security update” as they are only confirming the identity of the client. This makes clients feel
more confident about approving all the transactions requested by the attackers.

Messages telling the user that their system is compromised
Bizarro also tries to lure victims into sending two-factor authentication codes to the attackers.
Another interesting feature we have seen entails an attempt to convince the victim to install a
malicious app on their smartphone. It uses the following windows to determine the type of
mobile operating system:

Bizarro asks the user to choose the operating system of their smartphone
If the victim chooses Android, the C2 server will send a link with a malicious application to
the client. The client will make a QR code out of it with the help of the Google Charts API. It
sends a request with the following arguments:
1

http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chs=<QR code width>x<QR code
height>&cht=qr&chld=<error correction level>&chl=<link to the application>

The obtained QR code is then shown in a window with the following text:

Bizarro asking the user to scan the QR code

Attack scenario
With the help of the commands that the Bizarro developers have included in the Trojan,
adversaries may stage an attack with the following scenario:

Infection scheme used by Bizarro
According to the list of supported banks, the threat actor behind Bizarro is targeting clients of
various banks from Europe and South America. Based on our telemetry, we’ve seen victims
of Bizarro in different countries, including Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Germany, Spain, Portugal,
France and Italy. These statistics again prove the fact that Bizarro’s operators have
expanded their interest from Brazil to other countries in South America and Europe.

Distribution of Bizarro detections in the last 12 months

Conclusion
We’ve recently seen several banking Trojans from South America (such as Guildma, Javali,
Melcoz, Grandoreiro and Amavaldo) expanding their operations to other regions, mainly
Europe. Bizarro is yet another example of this. The threat actors behind this campaign are
adopting various technical methods to complicate malware analysis and detection, as well as
social engineering tricks that can help convince victims to provide personal data related to
their online banking accounts.
Kaspersky products detect this family as Trojan-Banker.Win32.Bizarro or TrojanBanker.Win64.Bizarro. All the details, IoCs, MITRE ATT&CK Framework data, Yara rules
and hashes relating to this threat are available to users of our Financial Threat Intel services.
