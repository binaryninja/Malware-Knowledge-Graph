Threat actors are constantly using new tricks and tactics to target users across the globe.
This blog is about the spyware PJobRAT targeting Indian users by disguising as
dating and instant messaging apps. The initial vector information was found on Twitter.
This RAT disguises as famous Indian dating applications like Trendbanter, Rita, Ponam
and instant messaging applications like SignalLite and HangOn.
Let us analyse one of the famous dating application “Trendbanter”.

Figure 1: Trendbanter App
Once installed the “Trendbanter” APK disguises as a legitimate WhatsApp app icon in the
app drawer to trick the user to open the app, however the app’s internal appinfo shows the
original app name, “TrendbanterNew”as shown in Figure 2.

It then proceeds to set “android:debuggable=true” from theAndroidManifest.xml, which
makes it easier for the threat actor to access the application data and can even run
arbitrary code under that application permission. as shown in Figure 3.

Upon execution, the installed app’s device gets registered with Firebase C&C with the
following details such as ipaddr, rip (remote ip), manufacturer’s name, phone model, OS
version, IMEI, phone number and location information as shown in Figure 4.

PJobRAT uses two modes of communication.
Mode 1
To establish a C&C channel this malware uses the Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
which is a mobile application development platform that allows threat actors to send
instructions from the server to the client using the PUSH message function. This allows the
threat actor to trigger and execute RAT commands by PUSH notification.
