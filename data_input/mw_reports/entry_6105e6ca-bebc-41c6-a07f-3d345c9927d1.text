March 12, 2020

In the wake of large-scale global events, cybercriminals are among the first to attempt to sow
discord, spread disinformation, and seek financial gain. In February 2020, the World Health
Organization (WHO) released an advisory warning of ongoing scams involving the ongoing
outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and informally referred to as “coronavirus”. These scams aim to
exploit people’s fear and uncertainty concerning the disease’s spread.
These can be broadly split into the following three categories:
1. Phishing and social engineering scams
2. Sale of fraudulent or counterfeit goods
3. Misinformation
While COVID-19 itself presents a significant global security risk to individuals and
organizations across the world, cybercriminal activity around this global pandemic can result
in financial damage and promote dangerous guidance, ultimately putting additional strain on
efforts to contain the virus.

COVID-19 phishing and social engineering scams
Phishing is one of, if not the single most common attack techniques. Reports of email
phishing campaigns using COVID-19-related lures surfaced almost immediately after
confirmed infections began increasing in January 2020. Health organizations such as the
WHO and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have been prime targets
for impersonation due to their perceived authority: Attackers have been observed tempting
victims with URLs or document downloads using promises of important safety documentation
or infection maps.
COVID-19 has also been a popular topic of discussion on cybercriminal forums. For
example, in February 2020, a user initiated a thread on the prestigious Russian-language
cybercriminal forum XSS to advertise a new COVID-19-themed phishing scheme. The user
advertised a method to deliver malware via an email attachment disguised as a distribution
map of the virus’s outbreak, containing real-time data from the WHO. The map itself is an
impersonation of a legitimate map created by the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science
and Engineering (CSSE). The offering was priced at $200 for a “private build”, and if buyers
also required a Java CodeSign certificate, the price would be $700.

Another phishing scam, as detailed by Sophos, impersonated an official email
correspondence from the WHO. The email contained a link to purported document on
preventing the spread of the virus, but redirected victims to a malicious domain which

attempted to harvest credentials. The email contained several grammatical and format
errors, which can be used by attackers to narrow down their victims and bypass spam filters.
We discussed this technique in our blog on The Ecosystem of Phishing.

These campaigns are often targeted towards geographies which have significant numbers of
COVID-19 infections. In late January 2020, a phishing campaign targeted individuals in
Japan with emails claiming to be from disability welfare service providers and public health
centers. The emails used lures of documents containing information on alerts of new COVID19 infections as well as preventative measures against the virus. However, when accessed,
the documents attempted to download and install Emotet, an information stealing malware.

Similarly, individuals in Italy, which has the highest number of confirmed infections of COVID19 outside of China, were targeted by a phishing campaign in March 2020 which
impersonated WHO officials and attempted to distribute the Trickbot trojan.

Organizations like the WHO or CDC are also not the only ones at risk of being impersonated.
Since January 2020, the number of COVID-19-related domains registered has increased
significantly: Digital Shadows has identified over 1,400 domains registered over the past
three months. While many of these are likely legitimate and dedicated to providing
information on the virus and its spread, it is almost certain that a portion have been created
with malicious intent. Malicious domains can be used to spread misinformation, host phishing
pages, impersonate legitimate brands, and sell fraudulent or counterfeit items. In March
2020, the UK’s National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) reported over 21 cases of COVID19-related fraud schemes, resulting in losses of over £800,000 in the UK alone. The NFIB
cited specific examples which included the fraudulent sale of face masks and sites which
promised victims a map of COVID-19 infections near them in return for a bitcoin payment.

Even domains which contain no overt references to the virus have been identified. Below is
an example on Pastebin that uses the lure of a purportedly infected Italian footballer to direct
individuals to a malicious site.

COVID-19 fraudulent and counterfeit goods
The COVID-19 outbreak has contributed to a global shortage of healthcare equipment.
Supplies like face masks and hand sanitizer have been out of stock at many major retailers,
and prices on ecommerce websites have in some cases tripled over the past few weeks.
This shortage is likely in part driven by the spread of misinformation. Face masks are
essential for the safety of medical staff but have little effect on preventing healthy individuals
from infection: The WHO recommends face masks should not be used unless caring for an
individual with a suspected COVID-19 infection.
China is the world’s largest global supplier of medical face masks, manufacturing
approximately 80% of face masks worldwide. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, production and
exports from China have been severely limited over the past few months. This has put a
strain on manufacturers outside of China, creating a market for counterfeit products and
fraudulent listings.
As mentioned earlier, hundreds of potentially shady websites have popped up that claim to
offer heavily discounted face masks. Even if the products are legitimate, there is no
guarantee that the products even exist to begin with.

Medical equipment has even been observed for sale on cybercriminal marketplaces. Listings
on Empire, an English-language dark web marketplaces, specifically mention COVID-19 to
help push their goods. One listing offers 2,000 boxes of surgical face masks for $6,500.
Vendors like these typically engage in the sale of illicit drugs, but have clearly seen a market
opportunity to branch out into medical equipment.

COVID-19 misinformation / infodemic
COVID-19-related misinformation has primarily been spread via social media and private
messaging platforms. Misinformation does not always have the same tangible financial
impact as other types of cybercriminal activity, but it can still be used to cause panic, incite
racism and xenophobia, promote harmful at-home cures, and result in shortages of supplies
and critical medical equipment. The WHO has labelled this proliferation of information – both
legitimate and not – as an “infodemic”, and have assembled a dedicated team to manage the
spread of potentially harmful misinformation.

Official government entities have also taken steps to curb misinformation. Below is a tweet
from the official account for the spokesperson of the Government of Kenya denouncing the
spread of misinformation.

Additionally, an Australian Member of Parliament also denounced a fraudulent social media
post that was impersonating the Australian Department of Health, advising individuals to
avoid areas populated with Chinese nationals.

Social media platforms themselves have also taken a proactive approach to help prevent the
spread of false information related to COVID-19 by flagging posts which may be illegitimate
and hiring third-party organizations to fact-check posts. When searching COVID-19-related
terms on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and even Instagram, users are prompted to obtain
information from official sources. This can even help streamline the dissemination of
legitimate information by providing centralized results.

Search engines like Google have also manually intervened to help fight the spread of
misinformation: When searching for COVID-19-related terms, users are provided an “SOS
Alert”, which includes news articles from legitimate, vetted outlets and links to official
13/16

resources from the CDC and WHO.

These measures are a great step in the right direction, and have likely already stopped the
distribution of a significant amount of harmful material. Organizations have become more
aware of the risks of the spread of misinformation over the past year, but there is still onus on

14/16

users to ensure that the information they digest and share is legitimate. This is particularly
important during global health crises, where the ramifications of misinformation can be
deadly. For example, some recipes for making homemade hand sanitizers are not suitable
for use on skin and can be ineffective in halting the transmission of COVID-19.

COVID-19: Staying safe on and offline
To help prevent the spread of misinformation, individuals should ensure that they only
follow guidance from official national health institutions like the CDC and NHS, as well
as international organizations like the WHO.
The WHO recommends the following basic protective measures to prevent the spread
and contraction of COVID-19:
Clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with
soap and water.
Maintain at least 1 meter (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is
coughing or sneezing.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.
Practice respiratory hygiene: Cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or
tissue when you cough or sneeze and dispose of used tissues immediately.
Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough, and difficulty breathing,
seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of local health
authorities.
Use fact-checking tools to challenge potentially dubious claims on social media.
15/16

Be wary of unsolicited correspondances that contain alarmist messaging and/or
impersonate official health and safety institutions. Grammatical and formatting errors
can help you identify malicious phishing emails.
Be wary of emails soliciting charitable donations.
Do not download files or visit unknown websites linked in unsolicited emails.
Do not purchase medical equipment from unofficial third-party vendors (particularly on
the dark web!). If a deal seems too good to be true, then it probably is.
