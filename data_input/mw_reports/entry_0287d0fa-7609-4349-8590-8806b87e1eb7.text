Phishing Emails Used to Deploy KONNI Malware
us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-227a

Summary
This Alert uses the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge
(ATT&CK®) framework. See the ATT&CK for Enterprise framework for all referenced threat
actor techniques.
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has observed cyber actors
using emails containing a Microsoft Word document with a malicious Visual Basic Application
(VBA) macro code to deploy KONNI malware. KONNI is a remote administration tool (RAT)
used by malicious cyber actors to steal files, capture keystrokes, take screenshots, and
execute arbitrary code on infected hosts.

Technical Details
KONNI malware is often delivered via phishing emails as a Microsoft Word document with a
malicious VBA macro code (Phishing: Spearphising Attachment [T1566.001]). The malicious
code can change the font color from light grey to black (to fool the user to enable content),
check if the Windows operating system is a 32-bit or 64-bit version, and construct and
execute the command line to download additional files (Command and Scripting Interpreter:
Windows Command Shell [T1059.003]).
Once the VBA macro constructs the command line, it uses the certificate database tool
CertUtil to download remote files from a given Uniform Resource Locator. It also incorporates
a built-in function to decode base64-encoded files. The Command Prompt silently copies
certutil.exe into a temp directory and renames it to evade detection.
The cyber actor then downloads a text file from a remote resource containing a base64encoded string that is decoded by CertUtil and saved as a batch (.BAT) file. Finally, the cyber
actor deletes the text file from the temp directory and executes the .BAT file.

2/6

Technique

Use

System Information
Discovery [T1082]

KONNI can gather the operating system version, architecture
information, connected drives, hostname, and computer name
from the victim’s machine and has used systeminfo.exe to
get a snapshot of the current system state of the target
machine.

File and Directory
Discovery [T1083]

A version of KONNI searches for filenames created with a
previous version of the malware, suggesting different versions
targeted the same victims and the versions may work
together.

Ingress Tool Transfer
[T1105]

KONNI can download files and execute them on the victim’s
machine.

Modify Registry [T1112]

KONNI has modified registry keys of ComSysApp service and
Svchost on the machine to gain persistence.

Screen Capture [T1113]

KONNI can take screenshots of the victim’s machine.

Clipboard Data [T1115]

KONNI had a feature to steal data from the clipboard.

Data Encoding: Standard
Encoding [T1132.001]

KONNI has used a custom base64 key to encode stolen data
before exfiltration.

Access Token
Manipulation: Create
Process with Token
[T1134.002]

KONNI has duplicated the token of a high integrity process to
spawn an instance of cmd.exe under an impersonated user.

Deobfuscate/Decode
Files or Information
[T1140]

KONNI has used CertUtil to download and decode base64
encoded strings.

Signed Binary Proxy
Execution: Rundll32
[T1218.011]

KONNI has used Rundll32 to execute its loader for privilege
escalation purposes.

3/6

Technique

Use

Event Triggered
Execution: Component
Object Model Hijacking
[T1546.015]

KONNI has modified ComSysApp service to load the
malicious DLL payload.

Boot or Logon Autostart
Execution: Registry Run
Keys / Startup Folder
[T1547.001]

A version of KONNI drops a Windows shortcut into the
Startup folder to establish persistence.

Boot or Logon Autostart
Execution: Shortcut
Modification [T1547.009]

A version of KONNI drops a Windows shortcut on the victim’s
machine to establish persistence.

Abuse Elevation Control
Mechanism: Bypass User

KONNI bypassed User Account Control with the
"AlwaysNotify" settings.

Credentials from
Password Stores:
Credentials from Web
Browsers [T1555.003]

KONNI can steal profiles (containing credential information)
from Firefox, Chrome, and Opera.

Mitigations
CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices
to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes
should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid
unwanted impacts.
Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines. See Protecting Against Malicious
Code.
Keep operating system patches up to date. See Understanding Patches and Software
Updates.
Disable file and printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong
passwords or Active Directory authentication.
Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications.
Do not add users to the local administrators’ group unless required.
Enforce a strong password policy. See Choosing and Protecting Passwords.
Exercise caution when opening email attachments, even if the attachment is expected
and the sender appears to be known. See Using Caution with Email Attachments.
Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited
connection requests.
Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.
Scan for and remove suspicious email attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is
its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).
Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.
Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external
drives, CDs).
Scan all software downloaded from the internet prior to executing.
Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate access
control lists.
Visit the MITRE ATT&CK Techniques pages (linked in table 1 above) for additional
mitigation and detection strategies.
