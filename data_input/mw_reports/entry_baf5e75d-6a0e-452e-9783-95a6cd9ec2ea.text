Sodinokibi!

Sat 10 August 2019 in Ransomware
After last week's analysis on GermanWiper I thought it would be about time to have a Look at
Sodinokibi aka REvil, the new weird kid on the block.

According to Cybereason the Sodinokibi Ransomware was written by the same guys who
created GandCrab, which is a pretty big deal after GandCrab retired recently. The samples
that I'll be looking at today were first dropped in Asia, but it did not take long to reach other
continents as well.
A general disclaimer as always: downloading and running the samples linked below
will lead to the encryption of your personal data, so be f$cking careful. Also check
with your local laws as owning malware binaries/ sources might be illegal depending
on where you live.

Where I dug up the samples this time:
Sodinokibi #1 available @ https://malshare.com/sample.php?

Sodinokibi #2 available @ https://malshare.com/sample.php?
action=detail&hash=7354af1a63f222ede4c9e0a6f84d57c2 sha256

1/7

Running it through VirusTotal we get a pretty good detection rate, but that is to be expected
since REvil is around for a few days already. Here's a direct Link to the VT Analysis.

2/7

Looking at Detect it easy we don't see anything special either. The PE seems to be built with
MS Visual Studio 2015 (Linker Version 14).

Entropy-wise we can observe a huge drop near the end of the binary.

3/7

The imports definitely indicate that somethings is wrong here. Only loading kernel32.dll with
3 entries is a bit minimalistic for ransomware.
4/7

For one to get his/her Hands on the actual PE with an intact/complete IAT there are a couple
of possible ways. Sergei Frankoff explained a very fast, but slightly "messy" Method on
OALive. I'll try to replay this technique and plan to come back to this sample soon to try and
script my way out of this hole.

A dump of the strings in the binary file can be found here. Likewise a sample of the
ransomnote dropped as a textfile by the malware is available here.

The Decryptor
5/7

Thanks to a businessman who shall remain nameless but decided to pay the ransom we can
take a look at the Decryptor V1.3 as well. My feeling about this executable is, that it is being
built to order rather than prepared in case a decryption is requested. The tool feels relatively
unpolished because of the active debugging, no obfuscation or anti-evasion.

Running it through Detect it Easy there is nothing spectacular going on here. Consistent with
the ransomware itself the decryptor was built with Visual Studio 2015 as well. Entropy-wise
there are no surprises either at 4.64889.
