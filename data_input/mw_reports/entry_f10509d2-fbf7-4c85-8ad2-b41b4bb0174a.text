Introduction
Since the beginning of 2020, Dutch and Belgian residents have been increasingly targeted
by financially motivated cybercriminals looking to obtain access to their bank accounts. In
many strikingly similar cases, fraudsters reach out to victims via email, SMS, or WhatsApp
messages to deliver fake notifications containing malicious links pointing to a phishing site.
The phishing pages, detected by Group-IB Threat Intelligence & Attribution system, are
almost identical and disguised to look like legitimate banking websites of the biggest local
financial organizations with the goal of tricking unsuspecting victims into providing their
personal and banking information.
Having analyzed the technical infrastructure and phishing templates used in these fraudulent
campaigns, Group-IB Threat Intelligence and Cyber Investigations teams uncovered a
massive Fraud-as-a-Service operation. Our researchers identified a Dutch-speaking criminal
syndicate, codenamed Fraud Family by Group-IB, which develops, sells and rents
sophisticated phishing frameworks to other cybercriminals targeting users mainly in the
Netherlands and Belgium. The phishing frameworks allow attackers with minimal skills to
optimize the creation and design of phishing campaigns to carry out massive fraudulent
operations all the while bypassing 2FA.
Fraud Family advertises their services and interacts with fellow cybercriminals on Telegram
messenger. The criminal syndicate is likely to be active since at least 2020. However,
phishing kits similar to those advertised by the group were already used to target Dutch
residents as early as 2018. Group-IB shared its findings with the Dutch Police immediately

upon discovery and notified the organizations whose names are being abused by fraudsters.
The probe initiated as a consequence resulted in the arrest of two individuals by the
Dutch Police. The arrested suspects, a 24-year-old man and a 15-year-old man, are thought
to be the developer and seller of the Fraud Family phishing framework. The 24-year-old
suspect will be arraigned before the examining magistrate in Rotterdam on Friday, July 23,
while his 15-year-old accomplice has since been released pending further investigation.
The blog post analyzes the methods and techniques used by Fraud Family's shady
customers, Fraud Family's technical infrastructure, and their phishing panels. Group-IB
researchers also described how Fraud Family attracts customers and interacts with fellow
criminals. The post provides comprehensive recommendations to regular users on how not
to fall prey to this type of attack.

Fraudulent journey
A typical attack of fraudsters who use Fraud Family's phishing infrastructure starts with an
email, SMS, or WhatsApp message impersonating a real company. The examples below are
fraudsters' emails and SMS masked as legitimate messages from a local company that
connects home seekers with the housing supply.
Such messages can be both targeted or sent out to multiple contacts at once. The victims'
contact details are usually obtained from leaked databases or from other criminals that
specialize in providing compromised personal information for social engineering attacks.
The tactic of using well-known brands allows fraudsters to gain users' immediate trust. These
fake notifications contain malicious links to adversary-controlled payment info-stealing
phishing websites.

Another tactic that we observed recently is when fraudsters contact a seller on a Dutch
classified advertising platform pretending to be a buyer. The miscreants first move the
conversation to a third-party messenger, WhatsApp in this case, and then proceed to ask the
seller to make a small payment using an e-commerce payment system used in the
Netherlands, to "verify the seller is not a scammer". The real scammer provides a payment
link that is none other than a phishing site. This method was well documented by Opgelicht?!

The phishing website (Fig.4) impersonates a well-known marketplace first, then pretends to
use Dutch e-commerce payment system to handle the payment and finally lands on the fake
banks' pages. After the seller, now a victim, clicks on the phishing site they get to select
which bank they would like to use to send the "small payment".

These phishing websites offer a high level of personalization. Once the victim selects a bank
from the list, which includes all known local financial organizations, a very convincing online
banking interface will be shown asking for their banking credentials: username and password
or the bank card number, depending on what they need to access a particular bank account.

The developers of these phishing kits made sure their customers, fellow cybercriminals,
could bypass 2FA. The crooks who use this phishing infrastructure get access to a web
panel that interacts, in real time, with the phishing site. When victims submit their banking
credentials, the phishing site sends them to the fraudster-controlled web panel. This one
actually notifies the miscreants that a new victim is online. The scammers can then request
additional information that will help them to gain access to the bank accounts, including two
factor authentication tokens, and personal identifiable information. While the phishing site is
waiting for further instructions from the attackers, the unsuspecting victim is looking at a
"Please wait…" screen.

Group-IB researchers discovered that many of these phishing pages have been developed
and supported by a single Dutch-speaking cybercriminal collective, codenamed Fraud
Family. In the next section we take a deep dive into Fraud Family's business model, modus
operandi and technical analysis of the gang's infrastructure.

Fraud Family's business
Members of the Fraud Family developed a sophisticated fraud-as-a-service infrastructure
resilient to conventional takedown efforts. This infrastructure combines ready-to-use phishing
frameworks, domains and hosting services that Fraud Family takes care of for less skilled
cyber crooks.
The phishing frameworks allow attackers with minimal skills to optimize the creation and
design of phishing campaigns to carry out automated fraudulent operations on a mass scale.
Phishing frameworks include phishing kits — tools and resources used to steal information
— and web panels that allow cybercriminals to interact with the actual phishing site in real
time and are used to collect and manage the stolen user data. The complete "plug and play"
phishing service keeps the framework under control and prevents it from leaking to the
public.
Members of the Fraud Family actively use Telegram as a way to advertise their services to
other less skilled fraudsters. These services include the sale of phishing tools, or the rent of
"ready to use" infrastructure that comes equipped with the phishing framework and anti-bot

tools to prevent crawlers, automated analysis tools and services like VirusTotal and
URLScan, and researchers from accessing the phishing sites. Any fraudster can rent the
Express Panel for €200 per month or the Reliable Panel for €250, as seen in Figure 14.

Group-IB cyber investigations team discovered at least 8 Telegram channels operated by the
Fraud Family gang. The whole network of channels has close to 2,000 subscribers. Their
most popular group has 640 members. According to Group-IB assessment, half of these
users could be actual buyers.
Group-IB's research revealed that there are many cybercriminals who are using Telegram to
offer phishing frameworks that include fake Dutch and Belgian banks pages and web panels
for managing these sites. Many of those plug and play frameworks are being offered with
different names and variations.
Deeper analysis showed that the majority of such phishing web panels traded on Telegram
are based on U-Admin, which is the panel initially developed by Ukrainian threat actor
nicknamed Kaktys.

Figure 13 Web panel U-Admin
According to Group-IB's findings, all of the panels designed to target customers of the Dutch
and Belgian banks are different versions, or forks, of U-Admin. It turned out that the market
of phishing frameworks in the Netherlands and Belgium is being dominated by the Fraud
Family. The gang tunes and customizes phishing frameworks like U-Admin and gives them
new names.
The most common name given to the panels modified by Fraud Family is NL Multipanel. Two
more panels being offered for sale, or rent by Fraud Family are Express Panel and Reliable
Panel, developed by the syndicate in 2021.
Group-IB found that the attacks that rely on Fraud Family's infrastructure increased toward
the final months of 2020. This trend continues in 2021 with the appearance of Express Panel
and Reliable Panel.
The conclusion about the growth of their operations has been drawn from the fact that
Group-IB researchers detected more posts and discussion about Fraud Family's business on
Telegram.
The detailed analysis of the web panels, modified and customized by the Fraud Family is
presented below.
NL Multipanel

NL Multipanel is almost fully based on U-Admin panel, which is offered to a wide range of
Exploit.in forum (one of the most popular hacker forums) users. NL Multipanel got its name
after being refined and customized by members of Fraud Family to fit the Dutch
cybercriminal scene.

With U-Admin comes a plugin called Token. Because this plugin allows the attackers to
interact with their victims in real time, it is the one used to target clients of banks that use any
sort of multi-factor authentication.

Figure 15 U-Admin Token plugin
When a new victim is online, the attackers use O-Panel to execute a number of operations.
This is useful to request any information needed from the victims. While the miscreants use
and request new data, victims are waiting for the phishing site to show a new screen asking
for this information.

O-Panel is very flexible and can be fully customized, by adding new, or modifying existing
operations.

Express Panel
Presumably, this made its public appearance in November 2020. Some of its features
include:
It is not based on U-Admin and sellers make sure to advertise that well

Reliable Panel
It was developed in parallel to the Express Panel by the same developer and also made its
public appearance in November 2020.
New features provided by sellers include:
Developed from scratch and based on Nodejs instead of PHP
"Lifetime" of about 2 weeks (average time from deployment to take-down)
Faster that NL Multipanel and its variants
Fully customizable
Allows live interaction with victim

Reliable Panel removed many of the weaknesses U-Admin has and is especially crafted for
the Dutch and Belgian markets. This phishing framework has the potential to become one of
the main tools Dutch cybercriminals can count on.

It looks like in a more recent version from 2021, the panel was renamed to "Reliable Admin".
Conclusion
Group-IB is actively and closely monitoring the attacks that involve Fraud Family's
infrastructure and provides information obtained from them to affected organizations whose
brands are being abused by the fraudsters, including leading Dutch financial organizations to
help them minimize the amount of fraudulent activity. Group-IB is collaborating with the Dutch
Police and also providing information to them on the alleged identities of the Fraud Family
members.
In order to help regular users avoid falling prey to Fraud Family's affiliates, Group-IB
team prepared a set of simple recommendations:
Always be cautious and fully aware of anything sent to you, even if you think it may be
legitimate.
Do not click on any links that you are not 100% confident are real
Double check the address of a website is the official one before you submit any
information
If the link comes from someone you know, confirm with that person using another way
of communication
Contact the organization which sent you a link to confirm they have really sent you that
message
If in doubt, use services like URLScan or VirusTotal to quickly scan the URL you have
been sent, and look for red flags
If you think you may be a victim of a phishing attack, quickly communicate with your
bank, the organization being impersonated by the fraudsters and the police. They can
issue an alert which may umlimately raise awareness and reduce the victim count
Keep in mind that usually official organizations do not use URL shorteners, so links
leading to bit.ly, s.id, tny.sh and others, are very suspicious and you should double
check the final destination
Report any identified phishing email or SMS to fraudehelpdesk.nl, scamadviser.com.
These reports aid cybersecurity professionals to investigate and take action against
fraudulent websites, in addition to helping protect other victims.
