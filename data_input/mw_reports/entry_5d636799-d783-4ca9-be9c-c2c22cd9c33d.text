Live off the Land? How About Bringing Your Own
Island? An Overview of UNC1945
fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/11/live-off-the-land-an-overview-of-unc1945.html

Through Mandiant investigation of intrusions, the FLARE Advanced Practices team
observed a group we track as UNC1945 compromise managed service providers and
operate against a tailored set of targets within the financial and professional consulting
industries by leveraging access to third-party networks (see this blog post for an in-depth
description of “UNC” groups).
UNC1945 targeted Oracle Solaris operating systems, utilized several tools and utilities
against Windows and Linux operating systems, loaded and operated custom virtual
machines, and employed techniques to evade detection. UNC1945 demonstrated access to
exploits, tools and malware for multiple operating systems, a disciplined interest in
covering or manipulating their activity, and displayed advanced technical abilities during
interactive operations.
Mandiant discovered and reported to Oracle CVE-2020-14871, which was addressed in
Oracle's October 2020 Critical Patch Update. Mandiant recommends staying current on
all current patch updates to ensure a high security posture. We will discuss this
vulnerability in greater detail in a follow up blog post.
UNC1945 Attack Lifecycle
The threat actor demonstrated experience and comfort by utilizing unique tactics,
techniques and procedures (TTPs) within Unix environments, demonstrating a high level
of acumen in conjunction with ease of operability in Microsoft Windows operating
systems. They were successful navigating multiple segmented networks and leveraging
third-party access to extend operations well beyond the initial victim. Furthermore,
UNC1945 operated from several virtual machines pre-configured with post-exploitation
tools in addition to their custom toolset to evade detection and forensics.
Initial Compromise
In late 2018, UNC1945 gained access to a Solaris server and installed a backdoor we track
as SLAPSTICK in order to capture connection details and credentials to facilitate further
compromise. The SSH service of this server was exposed to the internet at the time, the
same time we observed first evidence of threat activity. Unfortunately, due to insufficient
available evidence, the next indication of activity was in mid-2020 at which time a
different Solaris server was observed connecting to the threat actor infrastructure. This
indicates a dwell time of approximately 519 days based on recovered artifacts.
Although we were unable to determine how the late-2018 initial access was
accomplished, we did observe successful UNC1945 SSH connections directly to the
victim Solaris 10 server, since the SSH service was exposed directly to the internet at
the time.

In mid-2020, we observed UNC1945 deploy EVILSUN—a remote exploitation tool
containing a zero-day exploit for CVE-2020-14871—on a Solaris 9 server. At the
time, connections from the server to the threat actor IP address were observed over
port 8080.
Mandiant discovered and reported CVE-2020-14871, a recently patched
vulnerability in the Oracle Solaris Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM)
that allows an unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple
protocols to exploit and compromise the operating system.
According to an April 2020 post on a black-market website, an “Oracle Solaris
SSHD Remote Root Exploit” was available for approximately $3,000 USD,
which may be identifiable with EVILSUN.
Additionally, we confirmed a Solaris server exposed to the internet had critical
vulnerabilities, which included the possibility of remote exploitation without
authentication.
Establish Foothold and Maintain Persistence
The threat actor used a Solaris Pluggable Authentication Module backdoor we refer to as
SLAPSTICK to establish a foothold on a Solaris 9 server. This facilitated user access to the
system with a secret hard-coded password and allowed the threat actors to escalate
privileges and maintain persistence (see Figure 1).
Log –font –unix | /usr/lib/ssh/sshd sshd kbdint - can <Encoded Password> <IP
REDACTED> Magical Password

Figure 1: SLAPSTICK logs
At the initial victim, UNC1945 placed a copy of a legitimate pam_unix.so file and
SLAPSTICK in the /lib64/security folder. A day later, the threat actor positioned a custom
Linux backdoor, which Mandiant named LEMONSTICK, on the same workstation.
LEMONSTICK capabilities include command execution, file transfer and execution, and
the ability to establish tunnel connections. (see Figure 2).

UNC1945 obtained and maintained access to their external infrastructure using an SSH
Port Forwarding mechanism despite the host lacking accessibility to the internet directly.
SSH Port Forwarding is a mechanism implemented in SSH protocol for transporting
arbitrary networking data over an encrypted SSH connection (tunneling). This feature can
be used for adding encryption to legacy applications traversing firewalls or with malicious
intent to access internal networks from the the internet. The UNC1945 configurations we
observed are similarly structured with respect to the host alias, specified options, and
option order (see Figure 3).

As part of this multi-stage operation, UNC1945 dropped a custom QEMU Virtual Machine
(VM) on multiple hosts, which was executed inside of any Linux system by launching a
‘start.sh’ script. The script contained TCP forwarding settings that could be used by the
threat actor in conjunction with the SSH tunnels to give direct access from the threat
actor VM to the command and control server to obfuscate interaction with customer
infrastructure. The VM was running a version of the Tiny Core Linux OS with pre-loaded
scripts and tools. Also, we analyzed the Virtual Machine file system timestamps, which
coincided with UNC1945's overall operational timeline.
The VM contained numerous tools such as network scanners, exploits and reconnaissance
tools. Tiny Core Linux pre-loaded tools included Mimikatz, Powersploit, Responder,
Procdump, CrackMapExec, PoshC2, Medusa, JBoss Vulnerability Scanner and more.
Efforts to decrease operational visibility included placing tool and output files within
temporary file system mount points that were stored in volatile memory. Additionally,
UNC1945 used built-in utilities and public tools to modify timestamps and selectively
manipulate Unix log files.
UNC1945 employed anti-forensics techniques with the use of a custom ELF utility named
LOGBLEACH. The actor used built-in Linux commands to alter the timestamps of files
and directories and used LOGBLEACH to clean logs to thwart forensic analysis, as seen in
Figure 4.

$ touch -acm -r librpmio.so.3.2.2
$ touch -acm -r libyaml-0.so.2
Figure 4: LOGBLEACH
To further obfuscate activity, a Linux ELF packer named STEELCORGI was executed in
memory on the Solaris system. The malware contains various anti-analysis techniques,
including anti-debugging, anti-tracing, and string obfuscation. It uses environment
variables as a key to unpack the final payload.
Escalate Privileges and Lateral Movement
After successfully establishing a foothold, UNC1945 collected credentials, escalated
privileges, and successfully moved laterally through multiple networks.
UNC1945 obtained credentials via SLAPSTICK and open source tools such as Mimikatz,
which enabled easy lateral movement throughout networks to obtain immediate access to
other segments of the network and third-party environments. Stolen credentials collected
by SLAPSTICK were used to traverse the customer network via SSH and deploy
SLAPSTICK to additional hosts. After successfully authenticating, SLAPSTICK displays a
welcome message, as seen in Figure 5.

UNC1945 used ProxyChains to
download PUPYRAT, an open source,
cross-platform multi-functional remote administration and post-exploitation tool mainly
written in Python.
At one target, the threat actor used a virtual machine to initiate a brute-force of SSH
targeting Linux and HP-UX endpoints. Beginning with seemingly random usernames and
shifting to legitimate Linux and Windows accounts, the threat actor successfully
established SSH connections on a Linux endpoint. After successfully escalating privileges
on an HP-UX endpoint and a Linux endpoint, UNC1945 installed three backdoors:
SLAPSTICK, TINYSHELL, and OKSOLO.
We observed UNC1945 use IMPACKET with SMBEXEC in a Microsoft Windows
environment to execute commands remotely without the need to upload a payload to the
target. SMBEXEC allows the threat actor to operate like PsExec, but without using
RemComSvc. There are two main modes of using this tool that benefits attackers. Share
mode allows the specification of a share that everything will be executed through. Server
mode permits the output of the executed commands to be sent back by the target machine
into a locally shared folder.

At one victim, we observed UNC1945 moving laterally via Remote Desktop Protocol
(RDP) to a Windows server before viewing the Server Manager Panel, viewing and
modifying RDP-related system firewall rules and checking the application settings of two
endpoint security services.
Internal Reconnaissance
Mandiant investigations found that the threat actor maintains various tools to interact
with victim networks. In addition to custom tools, the UNC1945 VMs contained various
tools (e.g. network scanners, exploits and reconnaissance; see Associated Tools and
Malware section).
In some intrusions, UNC1945 employed a SPARC executable identified as a
reconnaissance tool. Based on publicly available information, this executable could be
referred to as Luckscan or BlueKeep, the latter of which is part of the BKScan toolkit (see
Figure 6).

Figure 6: SPARC executable recon tool command line used by the threat actor
According to open sources, BlueKeep, aka “bkscan” scanner, works both unauthenticated
and authenticated (i.e. when Network Level Authentication is enabled). BlueKeep (CVE2019-0708) is a security vulnerability that was discovered in Microsoft's Remote Desktop
Protocol (RDP) implementation, which allows for the possibility of remote code
execution.
Complete Mission
Despite this multi-staged operation, Mandiant did not observe evidence of data
exfiltration and was unable to determine UNC1945's mission for most of the intrusions we
investigated. In at least one case, we observed ROLLCOAST ransomware deployment in
the final phase of the threat actor activity, but Mandiant didn’t attribute this activity to
UNC1945. At this time, it is likely that access to the victim environment was sold to
another group.
Conclusion
The ease and breadth of exploitation in which UNC1945 conducted this campaign
suggests a sophisticated, persistent actor comfortable exploiting various operating
systems, and access to resources and numerous toolsets. Given the aforementioned
factors, use of zero-day exploits and virtual machines, and ability to traverse multiple
third-party networks, Mandiant expects this motivated threat actor to continue targeted
operations against key industries while taking advantage of operating systems that likely
have inadequate security visibility.

Associated Tools and Malware Families
EVILSUN is a remote exploitation tool that gains access to Solaris 10 and 11 systems of
SPARC or i386 architecture using a vulnerability (CVE-2020-14871) exposed by SSH
keyboard-interactive authentication. The remote exploitation tool makes SSH connections
to hosts passed on the command line. The default port is the normal SSH port (22), but
this may be overridden. EVILSUN passes the banner string SSH-2.0-Sun_SSH_1.1.3 over
the connection in clear text as part of handshaking.
LEMONSTICK is a Linux executable command line utility with backdoor capabilities. The
backdoor can execute files, transfer files, and tunnel connections. LEMONSTICK can be
started in two different ways: passing the `-c` command line argument (with an optional
file) and setting the ‘OCB’ environment variable. When started with the `-c` command
line argument, LEMONSTICK spawns an interactive shell. When started in OCB mode,
LEMONSTICK expects to read from STDIN. The STDIN data is expected to be encrypted
with the blowfish algorithm. After decrypting, it dispatches commands based on the name
—for example: ‘executes terminal command’, ‘connect to remote system’, ‘send & retrieve
file’, ‘create socket connection’.
LOGBLEACH is an ELF utility that has a primary functionality of deleting log entries
from a specified log file(s) based on a filter provided via command line. The following log
files are hard coded in the malware, but additional log paths may be specified:
/var/run/utmp
/var/log/wtmp
/var/log/btmp
/var/log/lastlog
/var/log/faillog
/var/log/syslog
/var/log/messages
/var/log/secure
/var/log/auth.log
OKSOLO is a publicly available backdoor that binds a shell to a specified port. It can be
compiled to support password authentication or dropped into a root shell.
OPENSHACKLE is a reconnaissance tool that collects information about logged-on users
and saves it to a file. OPENSHACKLE registers Windows Event Manager callback to
achieve persistence.
ProxyChains allows the use of SSH, TELNET, VNC, FTP and any other internet
application from behind HTTP (HTTPS) and SOCKS (4/5) proxy servers. This "proxifier"
provides proxy server support to any application.
PUPYRAT (aka Pupy) is an open source, multi-platform (Windows, Linux, OSX,
Android), multi-function RAT (Remote Administration Tool) and post-exploitation tool
mainly written in Python. It features an all-in-memory execution guideline and leaves

very low footprint. It can communicate using various transports, migrate into processes
(reflective injection), and load remote Python code, Python packages and Python Cextensions from memory.
STEELCORGI is a packer for Linux ELF programs that uses key material from the
executing environment to decrypt the payload. When first starting up, the malware
expects to find up to four environment variables that contain numeric values. The
malware uses the environment variable values as a key to decrypt additional data to be
executed.
SLAPSTICK is a Solaris PAM backdoor that grants a user access to the system with a
secret, hard-coded password.
TINYSHELL is a lightweight client/server clone of the standard remote shell tools (rlogin,
telnet, ssh, etc.), which can act as a backdoor and provide remote shell execution as well
as file transfers.
