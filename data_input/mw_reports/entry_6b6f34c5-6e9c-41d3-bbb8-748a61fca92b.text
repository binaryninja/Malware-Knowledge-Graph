Canadian Police Raid ‘Orcus RAT’ Author

Canadian police last week raided the residence of a Toronto software developer behind
“Orcus RAT,” a product that’s been marketed on underground forums and used in countless
malware attacks since its creation in 2015. Its author maintains Orcus is a
legitimate Remote Administration Tool that is merely being abused, but security experts say
it includes multiple features more typically seen in malware known as
a Remote Access Trojan.

As first detailed by KrebsOnSecurity in July 2016, Orcus is the brainchild of John “Armada”
Revesz, a Toronto resident who until recently maintained and sold the RAT under the
company name Orcus Technologies.
In an “official press release” posted to pastebin.com on Mar. 31, 2019, Revesz said his
company recently was the subject of an international search warrant executed jointly by
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and the Canadian Radio-television and
Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).
“In this process authorities seized numerous backup hard drives [containing] a large portion
of Orcus Technologies business, and practices,” Revesz wrote. “Data inclusive on these
drives include but are not limited to: User information inclusive of user names, real names,
financial transactions, and further. The arrests and searches expand to an international
investigation at this point, including countries as America, Germany, Australia, Canada and
potentially more.”
Reached via email, Revesz declined to say whether he was arrested in connection with the
search warrant, a copy of which he shared with KrebsOnSecurity. In response to an inquiry
from this office, the RCMP stopped short of naming names, but said “we can confirm that our
1/4

National Division Cybercrime Investigative Team did execute a search warrant at a Toronto
location last week.”
The RCMP said the raid was part of an international coordinated effort with the Federal
Bureau of Investigation and the Australian Federal Police, as part of “a series of ongoing,
parallel investigations into Remote Access Trojan (RAT) technology. This type of malicious
software (malware) enables remote access to Canadian computers, without their users’
consent and can lead to the subsequent installation of other malware and theft of personal
information.”
“The CRTC executed a warrant under Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) and the
RCMP National Division executed a search warrant under the Criminal Code respectively,”
reads a statement published last week by the Canadian government. “Tips from international
private cyber security firms triggered the investigation.”
Revesz maintains his software was designed for legitimate use only and for system
administrators seeking more powerful, full-featured ways to remotely manage multiple PCs
around the globe. He’s also said he’s not responsible for how licensed customers use his
products, and that he actively kills software licenses for customers found to be using it for
online fraud.
Yet the list of features and plugins advertised for this RAT includes functionality that goes
significantly beyond what one might see in a traditional remote administration tool, such as
DDoS-for-hire capabilities, and the ability to disable the light indicator on webcams so as not
to alert the target that the RAT is active.
“It can also implement a watchdog that restarts the server component or even trigger a Blue
Screen of Death (BSOD) if the someone tries to kill its process,” wrote researchers at
security firm Fortinet in a Dec. 2017 analysis of the RAT. “This makes it harder for targets to
remove it from their systems. These are, of course, on top of the obviously ominous features
such as password retrieval and key logging that are normally seen in Remote Access
Trojans.”
As KrebsOnSecurity noted in 2016, in conjunction with his RAT Revesz also sold and
marketed a bulletproof “dynamic DNS service” that promised not to keep any records of
customer activity.
Revesz appears to have a flair for the dramatic, and has periodically emailed this author over
the years. Sometimes, the missives were taunting, or vaguely ominous and threatening. Like
the time he reached out to say he was hiring a private investigator to find and track me. Still
other unbidden communications from Revesz were friendly, even helpful with timely news
tips.

According to Revesz himself, he is no stranger to the Canadian legal system. In June 2018,
Revesz shared court documents indicating he has been involved in multiple physical assault
charges since 2007, including “7 domestic disputes between partners as well as incidents
with his parents.”
“I am not your A-typical computer geek, Brian,” he wrote in a 2018 email. “I tend to have a
violent nature, and have both Martial arts and Military training. So, I suppose it is really good
that I took your article with a grain of salt instead of actually really getting upset.”

The sale and marketing of remote administration tools is not illegal in the United States, and
indeed there are plenty of such tools sold by legitimate companies to help computer experts
remotely administer computers.
However, these tools tend to be viewed by prosecutors as malware and spyware when their
proprietors advertise them as hacking devices and provide customer support aimed at
helping buyers deploy the RATs stealthily and evade detection by anti-malware programs.
Last year, a 21-year-old Kentucky man pleaded guilty to authoring and distributing a popular
hacking tool called “LuminosityLink,” which experts say was used by thousands of
customers to gain access to tens of thousands of computers across 78 countries worldwide.
Also in 2018, 27-year-old Arkansas resident Taylor Huddleston was sentenced to three
years in jail for making and selling the “NanoCore RAT,” which was being used to spy on
webcams and steal passwords from systems running the software.
In many previous law enforcement investigations targeting RAT developers and sellers,
investigators also have targeted customers of these products. In 2014, the U.S. Justice
Department announced a series of actions against more than 100 people accused of
purchasing and using “Blackshades,” a cheap and powerful RAT that the U.S. government
said was used to infect more than a half million computers worldwide.

Earlier this year, Revesz posted on Twitter that he was making the source code for Orcus
RAT publicly available, and focusing his attention on developing a new and improved RAT
product.
Meanwhile on Hackforums[.]net — the forum where Orcus was principally advertised and
sold — members and customers expressed concern that authorities would soon be visiting
Orcus RAT customers, posts that were deleted almost as quickly by the Hackforums
administrator.
As if in acknowledgement of that concern, in the Pastebin press release published this week
Revesz warned people away from using Orcus RAT, and added some choice advice for
others who would follow his path.
“Orcus is no longer to be considered safe or secure solution to Remote Administrative
needs,” he wrote, pointing to a screenshot of a court order he says came from one of the
police investigators, which requires him to abstain from accessing Hackforums or Orcusrelated sites. “Please move away from this software without delay. It has been a pleasure
getting to know everyone in my time online, and I hope you all can take my words as a life
lesson. Stay safe, don’t do stupid shit.”
