The operators of the REvil Ransomware, otherwise known as Sodinokibi, have announced
that they will use stolen files and data as leverage to get victims to pay ransoms.
A new tactic by ransomware developers is to release a victim's data if they do not pay the
ransom. While we have seen these threats in the past, only recently have
Ransomware operators, such as Maze, actually followed through.
In a new post to a Russian malware and hacker forum shared with us by security
researcher Damian, the public-facing representative of the REvil ransomware known as
UNKN states that a new "division" has been created for large operations.
They claim that a recent operation from this group is the attack against the CyrusOne data
center that was reported last week. As part of this operation, UNKN claims that they have
stolen files from the company before encrypting their network.
REvil goes on to say that if a company does not pay the ransom, the ransomware actors
will publicly release the stolen data or sell it to competitors. It is in their opinion that this
would be more costly to the victim than paying the ransom.

Forum post by REvil operator
The original Russian text from the above post is below:
Если не отвечаем - значит не интересны. Либо мест нет.
Мы открыли отдельное подразделение, которое занимается крупными операциями. Неделю
назад был осуществлен доступ к CyrusOne. Судя по СМИ - платить они не собираются.
Очень жаль. Тактика "потратим 100 миллионов на восстановление с нуля, чем 15 на
выкуп" такая же эффективная, как и оправдания Гарика Куколда Харламова. Инвесторам
потом будете объяснять, где выгода. Каждая атака сопровождается копированием
коммерческой информации. В случае отказа выплаты - данные будут либо проданы
конкурентам, либо выкладываться в открытые источники. GDPR. Не хотите платить нам платите в х10 раз больше правительству. Нет проблем.
Очень странно, что cdhfund.com до сих пор молчат. Они также были подвержены атаке,
все данные скопированы и зашифрованы. В случае отказа - наши действия обозначены
выше.

The English translation via Google Translate can also be read below:
If we don’t answer, then it’s not interesting. Or there are no places.
We have opened a separate division, which is engaged in large operations. A week
ago, access to CyrusOne was made. Judging by the media, they are not going to pay.
Very sorry. The “spend 100 million to restore from scratch than 15 to buy” tactics
are as effective as Garik Kukold Kharlamov’s excuses. Then you will explain to
investors where the benefits are. Each attack is accompanied by a copy of commercial
information. In case of refusal of payment - the data will either be sold to
competitors or laid out in open sources. GDPR . Do not want to pay us - pay x10
times more to the government. No problems.
It is very strange that cdhfund.com is still silent. They were also susceptible to
attack, all data was copied and encrypted. In case of failure - our actions are
indicated above.

Ransomware attacks are now data breaches
For years, ransomware developers and affiliates have been telling victims that they must
pay the ransom or stolen data would be publicly released.
While it has been a well-known secret that ransomware actors snoop through victim's data,
and in many cases steal it before the data is encrypted, they never actually carried out their
threats of releasing it.
This all changed at the end of November when Maze Ransomware threatened Allied
Universal that if they did not pay the ransom, they would release their files. When they did
not receive a payment, they released 700MB worth of data on a hacking forum.

Public disclosure of Allied Universal data
During ransomware attacks, some threat actors have told companies that they are familiar
with internal company secrets after reading the company's files. Even though this should be
considered a data breach, many ransomware victims simply swept it under the rug in the
hopes that nobody would ever find out.
Now that ransomware operators are releasing victim's data, this will need to change and
companies will have to treat these attacks like data breaches.

This is because employee medical records, personal information, termination letters,
salaries, and much more can potentially be disclosed. Furthermore, if any third-party
information is stolen, which is highly likely, then that requires further disclosure as well.
It is too soon to say whether these new tactics will push companies to treat ransomware
attacks like data breaches, but as more ransomware developers publish stolen documents,
we can expect lawsuits and public concern to rise.

Lawsuits? That's like the victims of an armed robbery being sued by other customers!

It's not unheard of for employees suing a company due to "poor" security after being
hacked.
Here is an example:

Hoping not to be a complete pedant but PII unrecoverable from a ransomware attack
is already a data breach under article 4 paragraph 12. Also it could be argued that the
encryption of data by a malicious 3rd party could be unlawful "alteration" therefore
again a data breach in the eyes of the GDPR. My point being if you're company is not
treating ransomware encrypting PII as a data breach it probably should be.

I 100% agree, but to make matters worse and what I alluded to in the story, it has
been known for some time that ransomware attackers sift through company files in
order to add information to their ransom notes that scare the victim into paying.
It's just gotten worse with their willingness to actually publish data to public.
