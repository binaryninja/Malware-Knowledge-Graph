Summary
In the last 3 months, we have noticed increased activity from APT36, a Pakistan-linked
Cyber Threat actor. The target this time are personnel belonging to defence organizations &
other Government organizations in India.
In the recent wave of attacks, APT36 is using honey trapping technique to lure their targets.
The “honey trap” operations use fake profiles of attractive women to entice targets into
opening their emails or chatting over messaging platforms, ultimately leading them into
downloading malware.
Some of the attachment names that we found in the current themed attack:

When target opens such attachment, it drops MSIL based Crimson RAT which has been
used by APT36 in many of their past attacks. This RAT is used for data-stealing activities and
sending them to a CnC server.

Operation ‘Honey Trap’
Indian Army has described ‘honey trap’ cases as a weapon of hybrid warfare being waged by
the enemy across the borders. The same theme is now being used by APT36 to lure its
targets.

Campaign Overview
This campaign continues to use two separate infection chains. These two infection
techniques of APT36 have remained the same in the past couple of years.
In the first chain, a spear-phishing email has a macro loaded document as an attachment.
This document is responsible to execute a dropper module that starts the Crimson RAT tool
to perform malicious activity.

Scenario 1
In the second chain, a spear-phishing email attachment directly contains a dropper module
within a zip file. This dropper component opens a decoy document for the victim and runs
Crimson RAT tool in the background to perform malicious activity.

The second infection chain is not so successful in organizations as their firewalls usually
block ‘EXE’ filetype within an email. This is the main reason, it is targeting personal accounts
of individuals related to the Indian Defence sector.

Crimson RAT
Crimson RAT remains a popular arsenal on APT36 group. We had published details of
another APT36 attack last month; working of the malware remains the same.

Conclusion
It is a well-established fact, that APT36 targets defence and other critical sector
organizations. Usually, their targets are individuals and organizations which are of strategic
interest to India’s western neighbour. However, in this campaign, interestingly, some of the
targeted entities belong to organizations based in the eastern states in India! In last one year,
this is the second instance where we saw APT36 targeting organizations of interest to India’s
eastern neighbour
