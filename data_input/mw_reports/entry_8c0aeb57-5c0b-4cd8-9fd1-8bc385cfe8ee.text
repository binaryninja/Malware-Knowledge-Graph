WIZARD SPIDER Adds New Features to Ryuk for Targeting Hosts on
LAN
November 1, 2019
Alexander Hanel and Brett Stone-Gross Research & Threat Intel

CrowdStrike® Intelligence analyzed variants of Ryuk (a ransomware family distributed by
WIZARD SPIDER) with new functionality for identifying and encrypting files on hosts in a
local area network (LAN). These features target systems that have recently been placed in
a standby power state, as well as online systems on the LAN.

Magic Packet
The first new Ryuk feature attempts to wake LAN hosts that are in a standby power state by
sending them a Wake-on-LAN (WoL) magic packet. The affected machine must support
WoL, and its network card must have the setting configured in the BIOS. To identify
machines on the LAN, Ryuk reads entries in the host Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
cache; in addition, for each address in the cache, it sends a WoL magic packet. The packet
is sent over a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) socket with the socket option SO_BROADCAST

using destination port 7 . The WoL magic packet starts with FF FF FF FF FF FF ,
followed by the target’s computer MAC address. An example WoL packet is highlighted in
blue in Figure 1.

UDP packets observed being sent specifically to destination port 7 during a ransomware
incident may be an indication that Ryuk is present.
This Wake-On-LAN implementation is somewhat naive, because the default ARP cache
timeout is short-lived on modern versions of Windows. Thus, the number of systems that
may be impacted by this current implementation is likely to be limited, since only systems
that have recently been put to sleep would still have their MAC address present in a remote
system’s ARP cache.

ARP Ping Scanner
The second Ryuk feature uses ARP ping scanning to identify hosts on the LAN. To identify
the proper subnet to scan, it checks each entry in the ARP cache to see whether it contains
an IP address with the substrings “ 10. ,” “ 172.16. ,” or “ 192.168 .” in it. If an IP address
contains one of these strings, it starts sending ARP and PING requests to all IP addresses
in the Class C network starting with that string value. For example, if the ARP cache entry
contained the IP address 192.168.240[.]57, it would start scanning at
192.168.240[.]1 and increment the last octet by 1 until reaching the IP address
192.168.240[.]254 . If a host responds, Ryuk attempts to mount it as a network drive,
using Server Message Block (SMB), and encrypt its contents.

Conclusion
By attempting to wake systems and using ARP ping scanning combined with network drive
mounting, WIZARD SPIDER is seeking to maximize the number of systems that can be
impacted by Ryuk’s file encryption. The Wake-on-LAN feature is a novel technique that
demonstrates WIZARD SPIDER’s continued focus on increasing the monetization of
infections via ransomware.
CrowdStrike Intelligence will continue to monitor any further development to Ryuk by
WIZARD SPIDER. The CrowdStrike Falcon® endpoint protection platform detects and
prevents against Ryuk. For Falcon endpoint customers, prevention settings should be set at
a minimum to the following:
Next-Gen Antivirus: Cloud/Sensor Machine Learning: Set “Prevention” slider to
“Moderate”
Malware Protection: Execution Blocking: Toggle “Prevent Suspicious Processes” to
“Enabled”
Add any hashes to your custom blacklist for added protection
SHA256 HASH
