AdGholas Malvertising Campaign Using Astrum EK to Deliver Mole Ransomware

2/12

June 20, 2017 Kafeine
Overview
The AdGholas group has been implicated in some of the largest malvertising campaigns we
have ever observed. While this group has remained active, it appears that a number of
universities in the United Kingdom were recently infected with ransomware via an AdGholas
infection chain, a marked departure from the banking Trojans this group usually distributes.
Although the universities made headlines as a result of the infection, it appears that the attack
was far more widespread, with malvertising appearing on a number of high-profile websites.
Analysis
On June 15, 2017, several universities in the United Kingdom reported that they were victims
of a ransomware attack [2] [3]. We decided to investigate this and ensure we were protecting
and alerting our customers appropriately.
Because little information was available, we first followed public indicators [1] that actually
pointed to an unrelated spam campaign: we had already internally documented this campaign
spreading Dridex botnet ID 2302. We were unable to detect email activity explaining the
reported infections and turned to assessing the drive-by landscape for associated activity. The
Magnitude infection chain continued to avoid the UK while still spreading Cerber in Taiwan
and the Republic of Korea. We also ensured that the EITest [5] infection chain in the UK was
not redirecting to an exploit kit (EK). We were aware of an instance of RIG EK chain dropping
GlobeImposter ransomware, but the scale did not match that of the outbreaks reported by the
UK universities.
At this point, we began to consider whether AdGholas [11] into Astrum EK (also known as
Stegano EK [12] [9]) might be the infection vector, despite the fact that the ransomware
payload was inconsistent with the activity of their usual customers who normally spread
banking malware.

We then learned that the command and control (C&C) IP address for the reported
ransomware (137.74.163[.]43) was a Mole Ransomware C&C based on ET Intelligence portal
data. This also matched other forensic information from the events.

We searched for malware samples contacting this IP and found two, both of which had
submission filenames to VirusTotal (mopslb.tmp and ldmso.tmp) that were consistent with an
Astrum payload name on disk.
At that stage, we were almost convinced the events were tied to AdGholas / Astrum EK ([11]
[12]) activity. We confirmed this, however, via an HTTPS connection common to the
compromised host avia-book[.]com. We had been tracking its activity for several days with
colleagues at Trend Micro and contacts in the Advertising industry.

This host was used in malvertising campaign targeting a number of countries: Great Britain,
Australia, Canada, Italy, Monaco, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, and Switzerland. Later, the host
was also used in Japan, Taiwan, and the United States. We received confirmation that all of
the compromised hosts also contacted the current Astrum IP, 185.45.193[.]123.
We attempted to replicate the infection chain and successfully witnessed AdGholas activity but
were not able to trigger the EK redirection.

However, while we did not capture the redirection in our lab systems, we know this
conditionally leads to Astrum hosted with full HTTPS support on the host
185.45.193[.]123. [13]

Astrum tried HTTPS between March 30 and April 4, 2017, before adopting it permanently at
the end of May. Known CVEs used by Astrum include CVE-2016-0189 [7], CVE-2016-1019
[6], and CVE-2016-4117 [8]. The introduction of Diffie-Hellman [9] suggests that there might

be a new exploit the actors are trying to hide in this chain. Obtaining the patch state of the
compromised hosts would help rule out this possibility.
It appears that between June 14 and 15, Astrum was dropping Mole ransomware in the United
Kingdom and likely in the US [4]. Mole is a member of the CryptFile2/CryptoMix ransomware
family. We do not know the payloads in other countries, but, based on past activity, we are
confident they were banking Trojans. Unlike ransomware, bankers are generally less noisy
and often remain unnoticed by victims.

Conclusion
AdGholas malvertising redirecting to the Astrum Exploit Kit is the most evolved blind mass
infection chain known today. Full HTTPS, heavy smart filtering, domain shadowing, DiffieHellman, and perfect knowledge of how the Advertising industry operates allow these threat
actors to lure large agencies to bring them high volumes of traffic from high-value website and
targets.
9/12

Moreover, it is worth remembering that a common misperception about drive-by malvertising
attacks remains prevalent: there is no need to click on the advertisement to be infected. It is
enough simply to display the ad: if the machine is vulnerable and targeted, then the infection
occurs without any user interaction.
Acknowledgements
We would like to thank first our colleagues Joseph C. Chen at Trend Micro and Frank Ruiz at
Fox-IT InTELL for their tremendous help in this study. We would also like to thank people in
the Advertising industry and on the victim side who helped us directly.
