Introduction

Increasingly, cyberattacks targeting various industrial sectors are directed towards prominent institutions. In a
recent incident reported on April 8, 2015, TV5 Monde, one of France’s largest global television networks was
attacked by hackers, resulting in the disruption of eleven TV5 Monde’s channels. According to TV5 Monde, a
hacker group claiming to be linked to the Islamic State Group executed the attack.

This report analyzes the malwares used in the targeted attack against TV5 Monde in France.

Attack Outline
At 10 pm on April 8, 2015, TV5 Monde fell victim to a cyberattack by Islamic fundamentalist hacker group,
“Cyber Caliphate”, which claims to be linked to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Back in January
2015, this group hacked into the official Twitter account of the United States Central Command.
In this incident, 11 programme broadcasts of TV5 Monde channels were disrupted for 3 hours as the hacker
group breaches the Network’s internal systems and overriding the digital broadcast system. The hacker
group also took control of the Network’s administrative systems making emails inaccessible. The Network’s
social media accounts and website were not spared. The Network’s Facebook account was hacked, and
made to display images of ISIS.

Complete details on the attack are still uncertain, but the Network’s soft approach to security was exposed
on live television.

A live interview with a reporter the next day of the attack displayed usernames and passwords written on
post-it notes. One of the post-it notes revealed the network's passwords for YouTube. Twitter user “pent0thal”
confirmed that the password was "lemotdepassedeyoutube," which translates in English to "the password of
YouTube."

The same user, pent0thal, discovered another password in a publicly broadcasted segment of the news,
which can be seen above. TV5Monde’s negligent approach to security, like writing account information on
notepads pasted on walls, may have contributed to the hacking incident.

On April 9, 2015, Blue Coat, a security vendor, released a press statement on the TV5Monde attack.

According to this statement, the malware used in the TV5 Monde attack is a variant of Njworm that is popular
in the Middle East.

Findings #1: Njrat and Njworm, based in the Middle East
A Kuwaiti, known by the alias “njq8”, created NjRAT and Njworm. A simple search on the web shows that
there are numerous online video tutorials in the Arabic language sharing knowledge on executing and
exploiting with njRAT and Njworm. This level of knowledge sharing and support is making the backdoor
malware popular among attackers in the Middle-East region.

Many variants of this malware have been found ever since the source code was disclosed in May 2013. A C#
source code generator was even uploaded on an Arabic developer’s site on December 8, 2014.
With the increase in threats involving this malware, Microsoft Malware Protection Center (MMPC) took down
the NjRAT and Njworm malware families in June 2014. These malware families are believed to have been
created by Kuwaiti, Naser Al Mutairi, aka njq8, and Algerian, Mohamed Benabdellah, aka Houdini.
There is also VB source code generators. The VBS codes are slightly different as compared to the C#
source code generator, but it performs the same action – stealing personal information and acting as a
backdoor. When the VB source code generator runs, the attacker must enter the port number, and specify
the host address, name, directory and installation name. The output files created could be slightly different.

Findings #2: Source code generator and generation process
Let’s take a look at how some source code generators work.
1. Source Code Generator 1
When you execute the generator, a window to set the port will appear. Then, a message stating the port is
successfully connected will appear as below.

If you right-click on the white bar on the message above, a window will appear to send commands. The
command types are divided into w0rm, Computer, Run and Options, and you can send various commands
based on the command type.

[Figure 7] Command window

After selecting a command, and clicking Builder, a window to initialize the IP and port will appear. You can
specify the host, port, name and install name, and select one of the six directories.

2. Source Code Generator 2
Let us take a look at another source code generator. When you open the generator, a window to enter the
port number as in [Figure 9] and a window to specify a few settings as in [Figure 10] will appear.

[Figure 10] Settings page

The command type is simpler. The options are only Run File, VBS Code and Uninstall Worm.

You can specify the host, port, name and install name. The Spread File Name and directory has been
modified.

The biggest difference between the two source code generators is the process to verify whether the
environment is a virtual environment or physical environment.
Source Code Generator 1 does not include a function to verify the environment.
On the other hand, Source Code Generator 2 offers vmcheck() function at the beginning of the exploit codes,
where if it is verified that the environment is verified as virtual, the exploit code jumps to a process that
immediately deletes the VBS file and terminates.

Findings #3: VB script backdoor
The malware used in TV5Monde attack is a VBS (Visual Basic Script) malware created with one of these
source code generators. It steals personal information and allows remote control, and performs the following
actions:
1. Create files
C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\SecurityNajaf.vbs
C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\LocalSettings\Temp\(Original).vbs
2. Enable auto-run via Registry
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\SecurityNajaf
"SecurityNajaf.vbs""
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\SecurityNajaff
"SecurityNajaf.vbs""

"wscript.exe

"wscript.exe

//B

//B

3. Communicate with C&C server
The scripts are divided into initialization codes and backdoor codes. The initialization codes contain install
name, IP and port details.

The backdoor codes define the action of the commands sent to the C&C server.

[Figure 14] Remote command execution codes

This malware not only acts as a backdoor, but also steal user information that includes user name, computer
name, volume serial number and Windows version.

The originating address of the detected malware was the malware itself, so it is determined and highly
possible that it was created for testing.

Conclusion
AhnLab has investigated the malware that seized control of France’s TV5Monde and disrupting the
broadcast of 11 TV5Monde’s channels. Television networks are the perfect targets for cyber-attacks intended
for political reasons and it has been proven possible for attackers to take control of the television broadcast.
Television broadcast companies have an immediate need to reinforce security and take targeted attacks
seriously. Malware that are widely used in specific countries or regions could be executed as political attacks,
so it is also important to be up-to-date about these malware.
