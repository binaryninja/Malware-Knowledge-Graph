Egregor is a newly identified ransomware variant that was first discovered in September, 2020, and has
recently been identified in several sophisticated attacks on organizations worldwide, including the games
industry giants Crytek and Ubisoft.
Similar to the Maze ransomware, Egregor’s operators run an extortion ransomware operation, where the
data is stolen and stored on the attacker’s servers before it is encrypted on the users machine. Egregor is
probably the most aggressive ransomware family in terms of negotiation with the victims. Its operators give
only 72 hours to contact them. If the ransom is not paid, the data is released to the public via the attacker’s
website, “Egregor News.”

Cybereason Blocks Egregor Ransomware
The ransomware payment is negotiated and agreed upon via a special chat function assigned to each victim.
The payment is received in bitcoin:

Egregor News website - published data
Egregor is believed to be a relative of another ransomware called Sekhmet that emerged in March, 2020,
which shares a lot of similarities with Egregor and also some similarities with Maze.
Egregor is still quite a mystery when it comes to how it is delivered in the attack and who is behind the
campaign. Not much is known at this point, but speculation includes theories that Egregor is the “heir to
Maze,” after that threat actor announced they were shutting down their operations in late October. This
assumption is supported by the close similarities between the two - and of course the timing.

Key Findings
• Emerging Threat: In a short amount of time, Egregor ransomware caused a great damage and made
headlines across the world.

2/13

• High Severity: The Cybereason Nocturnus Team assesses the threat level as HIGH given the destructive
potential of the attacks.
• Low-and-Slow: Prior to the deployment of the ransomware, the attackers attempt to infiltrate and move
laterally throughout the organization, carrying out a fully-fledged hacking operation.
• Infection Vector via Commodity Malware: The infection seems to start with commodity malware. Based
on a preliminary reconnaissance of data sent to the C2 servers, the operators can choose to escalate to an
interactive hacking operation, which ultimately causes a mass ransomware infection.
• Detected and Prevented: The Cybereason Defense Platform fully detects and prevents the Egregor
ransomware.

Breaking Down the Attack

Egregor infection chain

From Commodity Malware Infection to Ransomware
Since Egregor is a relatively new player in the game, not many incidents involving it are covered and detailed
here, including information about the infection chain. The information available so far suggests that the initial
infection starts with a phishing email that contains a malicious macro embedded in an attached document.
The macro code downloads a commodity malware, either Qbot icedID or Ursnif, which provides capabilities
for stealing sensitive information that will later be used for lateral movement. This technique, which involves
using a commodity malware as initial infection and to eventually deliver ransomware, was observed before
with Ryuk ransomware and Maze.

Later in the attack, a CobaltStrike beacon is installed on the infected machine and the attack shifts to an
interactive hacking operation. The attacker uses tools for reconnaissance such as Adfind and Sharphound to
gather information about users, groups, computers and so on. This information will assist in the lateral
movement phase and also in performing privilege escalation, as Egregor compromises Active Directory in
order to become domain admin.
In this stage, after the malware settles on the victim’s machine, it starts communications to the C2 in order to
download additional components including scripts, DLLs and other files that will be used eventually to
exfiltrate data and encrypt files.
Among the dropped files observed:
A batch file that is used to run Bitsadmin and Rundll to download and execute the Egregor payload.
A Zip file contains a binary file that is an RClone client, renamed svchost, and RClone config files
(webdav, ftp and dropbox) used later for exfiltration.

CobaltStrike creates a service that runs an encoded PowerShell command that executes shellcode that
creates connection to amajai-technologies[.]industries:

Decryption of the Shellcode
After dropping the files needed for the attack, the attackers “prepare the ground” and undertake a final
procedure meant to avoid detection and prevention. The attacker creates a Group Policy Object (GPO) to
disable Windows Defender and tries to take down any anti-virus products.

Egregor Execution
As described above, the operators of Egregor deploy the ransomware payload after collecting the sensitive
information and setting the GPO to evade detection and prevention. To deploy the ransomware, they execute
the dropped batch file that, as mentioned, is used to download and execute the ransomware payload from a
remote server:

The content of the batch file
The Egregor payload can only be decrypted if the correct key is provided via command line argument to the
Rundll32 process, which means that the file cannot be analyzed, either manually or using a sandbox, if the
exact same command line that the attackers used to run the ransomware isn’t provided.
In order to execute the ransomware and decrypt the blob of code inside of it, the operators provide the batch
file with the key “-passegregor10” which resolves in the ransomware running and encrypting files:

Batch file execution as shown in the Cybereason Defense Platform
The encrypted file names are appended with a string of random characters as the new extension. For
example, it renames a file named “My_files.zip” to “My_files.zip.IAsnM”, “My_files2.zip” to
“My_files2.zip.WZlF” and so on. Also, the threat actor creates the “RECOVER-FILES.txt” with ransom note in
all folders that contain encrypted files, as shown in the figure below:

Connection to Sekhmet and Maze
Egregor shares code similarities with Sekhmet ransomware, as well as the notorious Maze ransomware.
Besides code similarities, the tree ransomware has a lot in common, including behaviour and characteristics:

Another way to search for the connection between the three is to look at the infrastructure. The IP address
185.238.0[.]233 different binaries, Zip files and scripts:
• Maze ransomware binaries
• Egregor ransomware binaries
• Zip files contains the RClone binary and configuration files

The IP address is referred to by different scripts including the batch files that download the Egregor payload:

It is also worth mentioning the similarities in the ransom notes of the three. They have a very similar
structure, and even some “copy-paste” parts:

In addition to the Maze and Egregor binaries found on this specific server, other samples were found on the
server, related to Prolock ransomware, as analyzed in this report.

Cybereason Detection and Prevention

10/13

Cybereason is able to both detect and prevent the execution of Egregor, Sekhmet and Maze using the NGAV
component. When the Anti-Ransomware feature is enabled, behavioral detection techniques in the platform
are able to detect the attempt to encrypt files and raise a Malop for it:

to the malicious activity
Using the Anti-Malware feature with the right configuration (listed in the recommendations below),
Cybereason will also detect and prevent the execution of the ransomware and ensure that it cannot encrypt
targeted files:
