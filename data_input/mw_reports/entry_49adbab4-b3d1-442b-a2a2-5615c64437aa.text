The FBI and CISA are issuing this PSA as a part of a series on threats to the 2020 election
to enable the American public to be prepared, patient, and participating voters.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency (CISA) are issuing this announcement to help the public recognize and avoid
spoofed election-related internet domains and email accounts during the 2020 election year.
Spoofed domains and email accounts are leveraged by foreign actors and cybercriminals
and can be easily mistaken for legitimate websites or emails. Adversaries can use spoofed
domains and email accounts to disseminate false information; gather valid usernames,
passwords, and email addresses; collect personally identifiable information; and spread
malware, leading to further compromises and potential financial losses.
Cyber actors set up spoofed domains with slightly altered characteristics of legitimate
domains. A spoofed domain may feature an alternate spelling of a word ("electon" instead
of "election"), or use an alternative top-level domain, such as a "[.]com" version of a
legitimate "[.] gov" website. Members of the public could unknowingly visit spoofed domains

1/2

while seeking information regarding the 2020 election. Additionally, cyber actors may use a
seemingly legitimate email account to entice the public into clicking on malicious files or
links.
The FBI and CISA urge all members of the American public to critically evaluate the websites
they visit and the emails sent to their personal and business email accounts, to seek out
reliable and verified information on election information.
Recommendations

Verify the spelling of web addresses, websites, and email addresses that look
trustworthy but may be close imitations of legitimate election websites.
Seek out information from trustworthy sources, verifying who produced the content and
considering their intent. The Election Assistance Commission (https://www.eac.gov)
provides a vast amount of verified information and resources.
Ensure operating systems and applications are updated to the most current versions.
Update anti-malware and anti-virus software and conduct regular network scans.
Do not enable macros on documents downloaded from an email unless absolutely
necessary, and only then, after ensuring the file is not malicious.
Disable or remove unneeded software applications.
Use strong two-factor authentication if possible, via biometrics, hardware tokens, or
authentication apps.
Do not open e-mails or attachments from unknown individuals. Do not communicate
with unsolicited e-mail senders.
Never provide personal information of any sort via e-mail. Be aware that many e-mails
requesting your personal information appear to be legitimate.
The FBI is responsible for investigating and prosecuting election crimes, malign
foreign influence operations, and malicious cyber activity targeting election
infrastructure and other U.S. democratic institutions. CISA helps critical infrastructure
owners and operators, including those in the election community, remain resilient against
physical and cyber threats. The FBI and CISA provide services and information to uphold the
security, integrity, and resiliency of U.S. electoral processes.
