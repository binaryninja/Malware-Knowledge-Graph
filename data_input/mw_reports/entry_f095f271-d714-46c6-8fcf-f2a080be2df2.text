Campaign Possibly Connected to “MuddyWater” Surfaces in the Middle East and Central Asia 0
Posted on: March 12, 2018 at 5:00 am Posted in: Targeted Attacks
Author:
Jaromir Horejsi (Threat Researcher)

We discovered a new campaign targeting organizations in Turkey, Pakistan and Tajikistan that has
some similarities with an earlier campaign named MuddyWater, which hit various industries in
several countries, primarily in the Middle East and Central Asia. Third party security researchers
named the MuddyWater campaign as such because of the difﬁculties in attributing the attacks.
However, given the nature of the targets, as well as the gathering and uploading of information to
C&C servers, it appears that the attackers are mainly concerned with espionage activities — with
the Saudi Arabia’s National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) publishing an alert on their website
regarding the attacks.
Given the number of similarities, we can assume that there is a connection between these new
attacks and the MuddyWater campaign. It also signiﬁes that the attackers are not merely interested
in a one-off campaign, but will likely continue to perform cyberespionage activities against the
targeted countries and industries.
Comparing the earlier MuddyWater campaign with this new one reveals some distinct similiarities:

Hundreds of hacked websites are used as proxies.

In addition to the common characteristics seen above, the campaigns also use similar obfuscation
processes, as are the internal variables after deobfuscation. A list of isDebugEnv is also present in
both campaigns.

Figure 1. Infection chain for the attack
Our research found malicious delivery documents (Detected by Trend Micro as
JS_VALYRIA.DOCT and W2KM_VALYRIA.DOCT) containing text and ﬁle names in the Tajik
language attempting to target individuals working for government organizations and
telecommunication companies in Tajikistan. Each document uses social engineering to trick
potential victims into clicking it to enable the macros and activate the payload. While some of the
payloads we observed were embedded inside the document itself, some of the payloads were also
downloaded from the internet after the lure was clicked.There is a separate lure with a program key
generator written in Java that was bundled with a Java downloader. However, the actual payload is
the same.
Some examples of the lure documents used in the campaign can be seen below:

After enabling the macros and the payload executes, two ﬁles – an obfuscated Visual Basic script
(Detected by Trend Micro as VBS_VALYRIA.DOCT), and an obfuscated PowerShell script
(Detected by Trend Mico as TROJ_VALYRIA.PS) — are created in the ProgramData directory
placed in randomly-named directories. The purpose of the .VBS script is to execute the PowerShell
script. The path to the VBS script is added to the task scheduler as a form of persistence.

Figure 5. The installed backdoor and persistence script
In other campaigns, two ﬁles are also dropped. One of them is the VBS script, however, the second
ﬁle is a base64 encoded text ﬁle, which, after decoding, results in the Powershell ﬁle, as in the
previous campaign. This is one simple layer of obfuscation, likely to avoid some antivirus
detections.
The latest change, drops three ﬁles – an.sct scriptlet ﬁle, an.inf ﬁle and a base64 encoded data ﬁle.
The scriptlet ﬁle and inf ﬁle use publicly available code for bypassing applockerCode examples are
also available on github.
The PowerShell script, which employs several layers of obfuscation, is divided into three parts.
Part one contains global variables like paths, encryption keys, a list of a few hundred gates or
hacked websites which serve as proxies:

Figure 6. The conﬁguration portion of the PowerShell script
The second part contains functions related to the encryption, which is a standard RSA encryption
with very small keys.

The third part contains the backdoor function. This function will ﬁrst collect machine information
and take screenshots before it sends this data to a command-and-control (C&C) server while
waiting for commands. These include the following actions: clean, reboot, shutdown, screenshot,
and upload.
The clean command attempts to recursively delete all the items from drives C, D, E, and F.

Figure 7. The clean command wipes drives C, D, E and F
C&C Communication
The communication is done via XML messages with the following supported ACTION commands:
REGISTER
IMAGE
COMMAND RESULT
UPLOAD
The backdoor ﬁrst ﬁnds out the machine IP address by querying the internet service
api[.]ipify[.]org, which returns the IP address of the currently infected machine. This IP address is
then fed to another internet service called apinotes[.]com, which returns the location information of
the given IP address.
The backdoor then collects the system information about the infected machine such as the
Operating System name, architecture, domain, network adapter conﬁguration, and username. It then
separates each piece of information with **, and sends this system info as part of the REGISTER
message:

Figure 8. The register message before encryption
A simple RSA algorithm with very small keys encrypts the message seen above. Let’s take the ﬁrst
character as an example. Character “{” = 0x7B =123. Variable ${prIVATE} = 959, 713 from
section 1 of the PowerShell script has two values; the ﬁrst number is the key and the second
number is the modulus. By computing (123 ^ 959) mod 713 = 340 we get the encrypted value of
the ﬁrst character (see number 340 in the ﬁgure below). The message above gets encrypted as
shown in ﬁgure 9 below, then its contents are sent via post request to one of many hacked gates.

Figure 9. The register message after encryption
The response to this message is another set of decimal numbers which can be decrypted by the
public key, which is stored in ${pUbLIC} = 37, 437 variable in part 1 of the PowerShell script.

Figure 10. The encrypted response to the register message
The message above can be decrypted to:
{“STATUS”: “OK”, “TOKEN”: “d02153ffaf8137b1fa3bb852a27a12f8”}
The XML message containing screenshot can be seen below. Note that the previously obtained
SYSID that serves as a machine identiﬁer, ACTION:”IMAGE” tells us that a base64 encoded
image will be followed in IMAGE ﬁeld.

Figure 11. The XML message with the screenshot
It seems that the attackers are actively monitoring the incoming connections to the C&C. In one of
our attempts, we sent an improper request to the C&C server, which replied with the following
message: “Stop!!! I Kill You Researcher.” This level of personalized messaging implies that the
attackers are monitoring what data is going to and from their C&C server.

Figure 12. When the threat actor discovers the researcher via an improper request
Another hidden message or a false ﬂag?
For the PowerShell script, the ﬁrst part contains a variable named dragon_middle, which is an array
containing a few hundred URLs ending with connection.php that serve as proxies between victim
and C&C. If communication with C&C fails, and if the PowerShell script is run from a command
line, a few error messages written in simpliﬁed Mandarin Chinese are displayed, with a curious
phrase that translates to “waiting for dragon”:
无法访问本地计算机寄存器 (Unable to access local computer register)
任务计划程序访问被拒绝 (Mission Scheduler access is denied)
无法连接到网址，请等待龙 (Cannot connect to URL, please wait for dragon)
无法连接到网址，请等待龙 (Cannot connect to website, please wait for dragon)
These messages may not reveal anything about the real attackers as the malware writers sometimes
like to embed false ﬂags into their programs to confuse researchers. The syntax and grammar
suggest that the language could have been machine-translated rather than written by a native
speaker.
Countermeasures and Trend Micro Solutions
Users unfamiliar with the various kinds of social engineering techniques might ﬁnd it difﬁcult to
distinguish a legitimate message from a malicious one – thus the need for education on identifying
and mitigating phishing attacks – especially if it involves organizations in sensitive industries such
as government and manufacturing. Context, in this case, is important. Users need to consider why

they received an email and avoid clicking on any links or attachments in general until they are
certain that they are legitimate.
