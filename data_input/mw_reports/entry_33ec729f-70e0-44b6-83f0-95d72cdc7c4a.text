RESEARCH SPOTLIGHT: NEEDLES IN A HAYSTACK
This post was authored by Mariano Graziano.
Malware sandboxes are automated dynamic analysis systems that execute programs in
a controlled environment. Within the large volumes of samples submitted daily to these
services, some submissions appear to be different from others and show interesting
characteristics. At USENIX Security 2015 I presented a paper in which we proposed a
method to automatically discover malware developments from samples submitted to
online dynamic analysis systems. The research was conducted by dissecting the Anubis
sandbox dataset which consisted of over 30M samples collected in six years. The
methodology we proposed was effective and we were able to detect many interesting
cases in which the malware authors directly interacted with the sandbox during the
development phase of the threats.
Another interesting result that came from the research concerns the samples attributed
to Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) campaigns. Surprisingly, some of the malware
samples used in these sophisticated attacks had been submitted to the Anubis sandbox
months -- sometimes even years -- before the attack had been attributed to the proper
APT campaign by a security vendor. To be perfectly clear, we are not saying that it took
security vendors months or years to detect a threat. Most times, we are able to detect
the threats in no more than a few hours. It is just that the malware samples were
mislabeled and not properly associated with APT campaigns. In general, the same goes
for non-APT malware campaigns. In this blog post, we tried to see if the same applied to
the Cisco dataset. Speci cally, we chose ten APT campaigns, -- some of which were
already covered in the Usenix paper. We decided to inspect two different datasets: our
incoming sample feeds / malware zoo, and the telemetry associated with our Advanced
Malware Protection (AMP) solutions. Talos receives samples from over 100 external
feeds ranging from anti-malware companies to research centers, while the AMP dataset

contains telemetry from the Cisco AMP user-base.
The remaining part of this post is organized as follows. First, we show the APT
campaigns we investigated. Second, we summarize the results of the analysis of the
Talos dataset. Third, we show the results from the AMP dataset. Finally, we summarize
our ndings.

The ten malware campaigns in the table above garnered signi cant media attention
when discovered, with some of them clearly falling in the area of APT. They were found
by different security companies between 2010 and 2015, having different levels of
sophistication and different objectives. Moreover, these APT campaigns were not limited
to western countries. They have affected organizations all over the world. Most of the
time, connecting the dots and drawing relationships between samples and campaigns
take months and many experts. This means the security company that releases a
detailed report documenting the campaign is aware of it long before the information is
made public. However, we believe the “public release” date is still a good metric, because
it is the moment at which all the other security companies and the entire world are made
aware of these threats.
Another important aspect during an APT investigation is attribution. While detection is
done quickly, attribution for these campaigns is often an open and hard problem to solve.
Most of the times the perpetrators remain unknown even after months of work by

Most of the times the perpetrators
remain unknown even after months of work by

security researchers. However, sometimes researchers are able to connect the dots and
attribute the attack to a threat actor. This was the case for some of the APT campaigns
discussed so far. Some of these threats have been attributed to state-sponsored actors,
others to cyber criminals or to espionage attacks. However, like in the USENIX
publication, in this post we will make no speculation about attribution.
In the next paragraphs, we will present the results of searching for samples associated
with these APT campaigns in our datasets.

This table shows the results of the analysis of our incoming sample feeds/malware zoo.
For every campaign, we checked in our malware zoo to see when they had been initially
submitted to us. Given that we know when information about these APT campaigns was
made public, we can compute the number of days it took the security community to
publicly tie the samples to an APT campaign, even though the samples had been marked
malicious for other reasons. On average, these samples went for 458 days before being
tied to an APT campaign. The table presents the average number of days for the entire
campaign, and we go from a few months as in the case of “Aurora” to more than three
years for “Equation”. Notice that these gures come from our malware zoo which
collects samples from external sources and in general are a good indicator given the
amount of samples received per day. Notice that these numbers vary based on the
dataset.

V I R U S TOTA L
The vast majority of the submissions come from big organizations such as Antivirus
companies. Interestingly, a signi cant percentage is submitted by VirusTotal. For this
reason we decided to check the submitters for possible links and intelligence
information. As already documented by Dixon, information about the submitters of
samples is not publicly available, but can partially be retrieved from their Intelligence
service. For every sample, it is possible to know a hash (a hexadecimal unique identi er
of the submitter), the country (from the geolocalization of the IP address of the
submitter) and the method (the way the sample has been submitted, for instance via the
web interface or the APIs). This opaque information complicates the analysis a little bit,
but it is still possible to obtain interesting results.

The table above summarizes our ndings from VirusTotal. The rst column shows the
hash of the submitter. This means that the submitter sent one or more samples of a
given APT campaign to VirusTotal before its public release. One can only speculate on
who these submitters are. They could very likely be the threat actors themselves, testing
to see if their malware is detected by the AV companies. They could also be security
researchers or vendors who are trying to get information from VirusTotal. It is
noteworthy that in most of the cases the same submitters uploaded samples belonging

noteworthy that in most of the cases the same submitters uploaded samples belonging
to different APT campaigns.

C I S CO A M P
We went through our logs to search for entries that contained hashes related to the ten
APT campaigns we have been investigating. Interestingly, we got hits for eight different
hashes belonging to three different campaigns that were discovered on Cisco AMP
customer machines before the APT campaign was publicly identi ed.

As illustrated in the table above, we identi ed eight malicious samples that were in the
wild before being associated with APT campaigns. It is important to repeat that most of
these samples were detected as malicious the moment they rst appeared on our
customers’ machines.
Surprisingly, one sample of the Equation APT campaign (fanny worm) was found and
blocked on a Cisco AMP customer’s machine a day after the public release of the
Kaspersky report.

Based on our logs, Cisco AMP found the sample
015FBC0B216D197136DF8692B354BF2FC7BD6EB243E73283D861A4DBBB81A751
twice on 2015-12-20. It was “unknown” to AMP the rst time, but detected as malicious
the second time.
E28EABEB678AFB5E172F4127C5692E742809FD86DFA8478C1DC6F9C13B2A8E5F
was “unknown” to AMP on 2014-05-06, but detected as malicious the next time it was
seen on a customer’s machine on 2014-05-07. In all the other cases the samples were
already considered malicious.

CO N C LU S I O N
As the number of threats per day continues to increase, the number of malware samples
security companies automatically analyze increases. Much of the analysis is comprised
of dynamic analysis systems, such as sandboxes, to determine whether the sample is
malicious or not. These samples are then stored for further analysis. Due to the large
numbers of samples, in many organizations the vast majority of these samples remain
categorized solely on the initial sandbox run. Even when these samples are shared
among companies or via other services like VirusTotal some malware samples can go
unnoticed for months because they are marked as malware but given some generic
name, such as “Win.Trojan.Agent”. Then we are shocked when a security company
discovers an APT campaign that has supposedly gone unnoticed for years.
The results of this post con rm the assumption of the Usenix paper, also based on a
dataset of a big security company and similar results are expected throughout the
security industry. Many times, malware is initially submitted to sandbox systems and
marked as malicious based on the output of the sandbox. Then the authors use that
information to tweak the sample to avoid detection in future sandbox runs through
various evasion tactics. In other situations, the initial sample may not even be agged as
malicious due to evasion techniques being utilized. By performing statistical analysis and
reducing the data through clustering, even samples that avoid initial sandbox detection

reducing the data through clustering, even samples that avoid initial sandbox detection
can potentially be detected as malicious. There is clearly a need for more advanced
analytical systems to identify campaigns and link the samples together.
Identifying today’s threats requires multiple layers of protection at various points across
the network, along with constantly updated threat intelligence information. Cisco
analyzes a massive amount of telemetry data and is able to ag malware as malicious
based on multiple factors. By performing manual and programmatic analysis of sandbox
data in conjunction with identifying behaviors which are associated with malicious
activity, even unknown APT campaigns can be neutralized.
