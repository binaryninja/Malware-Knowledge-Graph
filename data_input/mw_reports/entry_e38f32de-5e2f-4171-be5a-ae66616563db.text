2009 - 2011

The discovery of Stuxnet raised awareness of
cybersecurity issues all around the world. Through this
piece of malware, states realized that critical
infrastructures were vulnerable to cyberattacks and that
the potential consequences could be disastrous. The aim
of this hotspot analysis is to better understand the case
of the Stuxnet worm and its effects. The objective is also
to understand how Iran managed the situation and how
it reacted.
This analysis focuses on the specific case of the
Stuxnet worm and the effects of its discovery in Iran and
among the international community. In this report, a
hotspot is defined as a precise event that occurs in
cyberspace and impacts on the physical world.
Description
The Stuxnet worm was discovered in an Iranian
computer in 2010. This piece of malware surprised
computer experts due to its sophistication and the use
of four zero-day exploits. It was later found that the
malware was not designed to spy, but rather to
sabotage centrifuges in the power facilities of Natanz in
Iran. It is believed that the USA built Stuxnet with the
support of Israel with the goal of stopping or delaying
the Iranian nuclear program. The worm was probably
implanted in the Natanz power plant’s network by using
a compromised USB drive. This technique enabled the
worm to penetrate a network that is normally isolated
from other networks.

broken centrifuges and needed to create a new
cybersecurity unit. The technological findings of this
case study show that malware can be designed
specifically to sabotage a very precise piece of industrial
equipment. They also reveal new zero-day
vulnerabilities and that driver certificates can be stolen
and used for malicious intents.
At the international level, Stuxnet had the effect
of being a wakeup call for states, which suddenly
realized that they needed to enhance their cybersecurity
policies and/or strategies. They also recognized that
they required a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy
that extends to critical infrastructures and the private
actors that manage them. Stuxnet also had the effect of
decreasing tensions in the Middle East, as the Iranian
nuclear program was no longer perceived as an
immediate threat. There was also concern among the
international community that new versions of Stuxnet
might appear in the wild and in cybercrime circles.
However, no modified versions of Stuxnet have been
found since 2010.
Consequences
Various consequences can be derived from the
discovery of Stuxnet and its effects. First, states may
wish to enhance their cybersecurity by raising
awareness of the fact that even air-gapped networks are
at risk. States also need to integrate private actors
managing critical infrastructures in their cybersecurity
processes. Second, states should develop plans or
processes for responding to cyberattacks such as
Stuxnet. Relevant plans should include infrastructure
resilience as well as ways to respond to state actors
behind the attacks. Third, states could develop
cybersecurity norms and standards for industrial assets
to ensure a minimum level of security in networked
equipment. Fourth, at the international level, states
should try to promote international cooperation on
cybersecurity and international norms on states’
conduct in cyberspace. This could help to reduce both
mistrust and the risk of misinterpretation among states
in regard to cyberspace.

Effects
The hotspot analysis shows that Stuxnet had an
impact on Iranian society and politics by making it look
weak for not securing its critical infrastructures
properly. The effects were also felt in the Iranian
economy as the state had to spend money to replace the

Stuxnet

1 Introduction
Stuxnet is a computer worm 2 discovered in 2010,
which affected nuclear installations in Iran. This cyberincident provoked sweeping changes in states’ cyber
policies and strategies.
This hotspot analysis of Stuxnet is relevant
because the discovery of the worm constituted a
watershed in terms of how states perceive cyberthreats.
There is a clear distinction in cyber strategies before and
after Stuxnet. There is a wealth of literature on the
worm, but the time that has elapsed since the Stuxnet
incident has allowed researchers to investigate the
events from a different perspective and with a more
deliberate approach, eliminating opportunistic and
unfounded comments made in the immediate
aftermath of the discovery of the worm.
The analysis of hotspots helps to understand
theoretical and abstract cybersecurity concepts by using
clear examples. The aim of this hotspot analysis is to
examine how victims of cyberattacks were impacted and
how they responded to attacks. This report also serves
as a basis for a broader comparative analysis of various
hotspots. This broader document will also provide
suggestions on how states may wish to revise their
policies and responses if faced with similar situations.
This document may be updated in the future to
accurately reflect any new developments. This may
occur if and when new aspects of relevant events are
disclosed or important changes occur.
The analysis is organized as follows. Section 2
describes the historical background and chronology of
the events in the lead-up to the discovery of Stuxnet and
its investigation. It also examines the events that shaped
the specific context of the tensions between Iran and
the USA.
Section 3 of the analysis details the technical
specificities of the Stuxnet worm, what it was targeting
and who may have developed it. It shows that this
particular piece of malware only targeted a specific type
of centrifuge located in the Iranian nuclear facility of
Natanz and describes its effects. It additionally looks at
who may have been capable of developing a tool such as
Stuxnet and possible reasons for its creation.
Section 4 examines the effects of Stuxnet on
Iranian politics and society, on the country's economy,
in the technological realm and at the international level.
The impact of the Stuxnet worm on Iranian society and
politics was characterized by a resulting feeling of
insecurity and an indecisive stance from the Iranian
government. Any state falling victim to such an intrusion
would feel insecure and concerned about potential
similar attacks. This was also the case in Iran, and the
Iranian government also seemed unsure how to respond

Section 7 at the end of the document.

to the attack. Economic impacts were mostly marked by
the material costs of replacing the broken centrifuges
and building new cyberdefense capabilities.
Stuxnet also had some repercussions in the
technological realm, as it was the first time that malware
of this type was designed to target a highly specific
object. The discovery of Stuxnet also brought to light
new zero-day vulnerabilities and the fact that driver
certificates can be stolen and used in malware.
At the international level, the discovery of
Stuxnet provoked a wave of new national cybersecurity
strategies as states realized that cybertools can be used
against critical infrastructures. Also, states were gravely
concerned that modified versions of Stuxnet might
flourish among cybercriminals. At the same time, the
delays caused by the worm in the Iranian nuclear
program alleviated regional tensions among neighbors.
This
hotspot
analysis
concludes
with
recommendations derived from the effects of Stuxnet in
Section 5. These show how states can improve their
cybersecurity through awareness campaigns and
comprehensive cyber strategies that integrate private
partners in charge of critical infrastructures. States could
also enhance their cybersecurity by producing
cybersecurity guidelines or standards for networked
industrial equipment, and they can work towards
reducing mistrust and the risk of misperceptions in
cyberspace on the international level by promoting
confidence building measures (CBMs) 3.

chronology

This section explores the historical background
and the chronology of the events in the lead-up to the
discovery of the Stuxnet worm and subsequent
investigations. This analysis of events is important for
understanding the context in which Stuxnet was
developed and used against the Iranian nuclear program
and why it was used at that particular moment.
Stuxnet was discovered in the difficult context of
existing tensions between Iran and the USA. The
situation was strained by Iran trying to develop nuclear
energy and possibly nuclear weapons, with
circumstances even deteriorating to the point that Israel
was ready to physically intervene to stop the Iranian
nuclear program.

Events
George Bush gives his famous state-ofthe-union speech to US Congress
describing North Korea, Iran and Iraq as
an “axis of evil” for seeking to develop
weapons of mass destruction (The
Economist, 2002).
An Iranian dissident group discloses
that their government is enriching
uranium in its nuclear facility at Natanz.
The USA reacts by asserting that Iran is
trying to develop nuclear weapons.
Iran acknowledges that it is enriching
uranium at Natanz. Inspectors from the
International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) subsequently visit the nuclear
plant for the first time and continue to
visit the facility on a regular basis
afterwards.
The international community launches
diplomatic discussions to encourage
Iran to stop its nuclear program.
However, Iran proves uncooperative
and is subjected to new international
sanctions as a result. These in turn
exacerbate the existing tensions
between the USA and Iran (Davenport,
2016).

VirusBlockAda, an antivirus company
based in Belarus, discovers the Stuxnet
worm after the company receives a
sample of malware causing a computer
in Iran to continually reboot itself. This
malicious software surprises the
specialists because of its use of a zeroday exploit, which is unusual for a
computer worm (Zetter, 2011a).
Normally, worms exploit flaws in
webpages or bugs in genuine software
to infect a computer (Barwise, 2010).
The news of the discovery of a
computer worm using a zero-day
exploit goes public, and the antivirus
and technology communities start to
reverse-engineer and investigate this
peculiar malware. At this time, it is
believed that Stuxnet is a tool for
industrial espionage. Its sophistication
suggests that significant resources
were invested in its development
(Zetter, 2011a).
The antivirus firm Symantec reveals
that the purpose of the worm is to
sabotage and not to spy (Zetter,
2011a), noting also that about 60% of
infected computers worldwide are
located in Iran, which leads them to
believe that the worm’s spread may
have originated there (Matrosov et al.,
2010, p. 15). Indeed, experts retrace
the origin of the spread to five
organizations in Iran, confirming that
the country was the starting point and
probably also the target of the
infections (Lindsay, 2013, p. 380).
During the same period, it is also found
that Stuxnet’s Command and Control
(C&C) servers lose connection with the
infected computers in Iran. Experts
believe that this disconnection means
that Iran is trying to deal with the worm
and to contain its spread (Zetter,
2011b).
The Bushehr power plant in Iran is
supposed to launch its nuclear energy
section but is delayed. According to
Iranian officials, the delay is caused by
an unspecified technical problem
(Collins and McCombie, 2012, p. 85).

Iranian officials admit that some
personal computers from employees at
the Bushehr nuclear plant are infected
by a computer virus. They accuse
Western countries of being behind the
attack (Farwell and Rohozinski, 2011, p.
25).
Iran stops its enrichment of uranium in
the nuclear plant of Natanz completely
without giving any reason (Farwell and
Rohozinski, 2011). It is later assumed
that this was an attempt to purge the
power plant of Stuxnet. Later, the head
of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization,
and acting Foreign Minister at the time,
admits that a computer virus has
infected Iranian nuclear installations
(Albright et al., 2010).
The Institute for Science and
International Security (ISIS), a US-based
that
has
non-profit
institution
monitored the evolution of the Iranian
nuclear program since the 1990s,
confirms that the Stuxnet worm is
programmed to target elements
configured in the same manner as the
Natanz centrifuges.

3 Description
This Section first describes the specificities and
features of the Stuxnet worm and looks into the
technical details that make this piece of malware so
special. Second, it describes the particularities of
Stuxnet’s target and how it was infected. Finally, it looks
at the identity and origin of the possible developers of
Stuxnet and why they would have created such a tool.

3.1 Tool
Stuxnet is the name of a specific worm, i.e. a
piece of computer malware that targets supervisory
control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems in
industrial controllers. It is difficult, if not impossible, to
know exactly how the malware was developed, but
there can be no doubt that its development required
considerable resources in manpower, time and finance.
Specialists evaluating the development of the worm
estimate it must have required a team of five to ten
programmers working full-time for at least six months
(Chen and Abu-Nimeh, 2011, p. 92).
Stuxnet is sizeable – larger than comparable
worms – and it was written in several different
programming languages with some encrypted
components 4 (Chen, 2010, p. 3). It exploited not one but
four zero-day vulnerabilities to infect computers: an
automatic process from connected USB drives, a
connection with shared printers, and two other
vulnerabilities concerning privilege escalation. The latter
is a computer process that allowed the worm to execute
software in computers even when they were on lockdown (Naraine, 2010). Stuxnet looked to infect
computers running the Microsoft Windows operating
system via one of these vectors. When it identified an
opening, it used valid, but stolen, driver certificates from
RealTek and JMicron to download its rootkit. Using
these driver certificates, the worm was then able to
search for the Siemens Simatic WinCC/Step-7 software,
a program used to control industrial equipment (Falliere
et al., 2011, p. 33; Matrosov et al., 2010, p. 68). By
infecting files used by this software, the worm was able
to access and control the Programmable Logic
Controllers (PLCs), i.e. small computers used to regulate
power in industrial devices (De Falco, 2012, p. 6).
Furthermore, the worm was also able to communicate
with other infected machines and C&C servers in
Denmark and Malaysia in order to update itself and
transmit information about what it had found (Chen and
Abu-Nimeh, 2011, p. 93).
Once all these requirements were met, Stuxnet
launched its attack by changing the speed of the

3.2 Target
The target of Stuxnet appears to have been the
Iranian nuclear plant and uranium enrichment site in
Natanz. The fact that Stuxnet was programmed to target
devices organized in groups of 164 objects and Natanz’s
cascades were arranged in 164 centrifuges was probably
not a coincidence (Albright et al., 2010; Broad and
Sanger, 2010). The power plant in Bushehr may also
have been a major target, but it enriches plutonium and
therefore requires a different configuration of
centrifuges (Farwell and Rohozinski, 2011, p. 25). Iran
uses IR-1 centrifuges, a European model from the late
1960s and early 1970s, which are both inefficient and
now obsolete (Langner, 2013, pp. 5–6). These
centrifuges are also fragile, and an abrupt change of
speed can cause damage or even breakage. The creators
of Stuxnet were aware of this flaw and exploited it.
The nuclear plant of Natanz has an air-gapped,
closed computer network, which means that it does not
have a connection to the Internet or other networks. It
is therefore highly probable that Stuxnet infected the
network through the vector of a removable USB drive
(De Falco, 2012, p. 3), meaning that the creators of the
worm required a person to deliver the worm and infect
the network.

3.3 Attribution and actors
Several antivirus experts have asserted that only
a state could have developed Stuxnet because of its level
of complexity, resource investment, and the fact it
seemed to be specifically designed to target the
centrifuges in Natanz (De Falco, 2012, p. 26). What is
certain is that the creators of the worm had extensive
knowledge about the Iranian facilities, machines and
computer programs. They also needed a testing ground
to be able to verify that their target-oriented malware
was doing what it was designed to do (Langner, 2013, p.
20).
The Iranians accused the West and more
precisely NATO of being behind the attack (Collins and
McCombie, 2012, p. 87). Nevertheless, experts claimed
that both the evidence and the motive pointed to the
USA and Israel as the perpetrators (Lindsay, 2013, p.
366; Nakashima and Warrick, 2012; Rosenbaum, 2012;
Zetter, 2011a). There is speculation as to whether Israel
was involved in the development of the malware, with
experts from Symantec claiming they saw some
evidence of the country’s involvement in the coding
lines (Zetter, 2011a). This was suggested by the
presence of the word “myrtus” in the code, for example,
which was the name of the file where the worm was
stored while it was being developed. This word is

believed to be a reference to Queen Esther, who saved
the Jews from a massacre by the Persians according to
the Bible and whose name in Hebrew refers to the word
“myrtle” (Zetter, 2011a). The involvement of Israel in the
development of Stuxnet remains uncertain, and any
evidence pointing in that direction may have been
planted to mask the identity of the real perpetrator.
However, Richard Clarke, the former US National
Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection and
Counter-terrorism, argued that if the USA had
developed Stuxnet, Israel may have assisted in the
project by providing a testing site with a sample similar
to the IR-1 centrifuge (De Falco, 2012, p. 26;
Rosenbaum, 2012).
The New York Times journalist David E. Sanger
reported in his book that the USA conducted a covert
cyber-campaign, named Operation Olympic Games,
against Iranian nuclear facilities. It is believed that
Stuxnet was one piece of malware developed and
launched in the context of this operation. The campaign
most likely began in 2006 under the Bush administration
and would have been intensified under US President
Obama (Zetter, 2011a). The operation was unlikely to
have been limited to cyberspace. The assassinations of
Iranian scientists in 2010 and 2011 that were attributed
to the USA and Israel suggest that Stuxnet was only one
component of a larger operation aimed at slowing down
or stopping Iran’s development of nuclear technology
(De Falco, 2012). It is also believed that the covert cyberoperation was an agreed concession to avoid an Israeli
airstrike on Iranian nuclear facilities. Previously,
President Bush had refused to allow Israeli jets to cross
the Iraqi border to strike Iranian nuclear installations (De
Falco, 2012, p. 54; Lindsay, 2013, p. 366).
Alternatively, Farwell and Rohozinski (2011)
argue that Stuxnet’s patchwork design indicates that
Stuxnet could have been developed, at least in part, by
the cybercrime sector, specifically the Russian offshore
programming community. They explain that some
elements of the worm’s code feature the same design as
code written by the cybercrime community. They assert
that the USA still would have been the main developer,
but that it could have outsourced the development of
certain parts of Stuxnet to these groups.
There is also the possibility that Russia
perpetrated the attack. Russian workers had access to
nuclear facilities in Iran as part of a Russo-Iranian
cooperation at the Bushehr nuclear site. Russia has the
capabilities to develop such malware, and its motive
may have been to prevent Iran from enriching its own
uranium by damaging the country’s nuclear sites with
Stuxnet. As a consequence, Iran would have had no
choice but to buy enriched uranium from Russia (De
Falco, 2012, p. 28).
There will always be uncertainties when it comes
to attribution in cyberspace. Attribution would normally
follow the “cui bono” (to whose benefit) logic. However,
it is difficult, if not impossible, to prove that a particular

8

Stuxnet

actor that seems to be the perpetrator is indeed the
perpetrator. In the case of Stuxnet, most evidence
points towards the USA as the main instigator of the
development and release of Stuxnet. Indeed, the USA
would have delayed the uranium enrichment program
and avoided a war between Iran and Israel with Stuxnet.
Even so, the involvement of Israel or Russia remains a
possibility and, as is often the case in covert operations
and cyberattacks, nothing can be confirmed beyond any
doubt.

4 Effects
First, this Section analyzes the social and
domestic political effects resulting from the Stuxnet
attack on the Natanz power plant. Second, it examines
how the malware impacted the Iranian economy. Third,
it studies the effects of the worm in the technological
realm. Finally, it looks into the impacts of the discovery
of Stuxnet at the international level.

4.1 Social and political effects
On the domestic political level, the cyberattack
discredited the Iranian government, as the Iranian
authorities were not able to protect their nuclear
facilities against a foreign cyberattack. The Iranian
government seemed indecisive on how to officially react
to the news that a computer worm might have infected
its nuclear facilities. In September 2010, the Iranian
authorities first played down the impact of the attack in
their discourse, probably to avoid blame from the
Iranian population, by stating that only personal
computers without connections to the nuclear facility of
Bushehr were infected and by designating the West and
NATO as perpetrators. Two months later, they admitted
that the worm had been active in their nuclear plants for
more than a year. However, they did not stay passive
and worked intensively to contain and remove the
worm, and to identify the attackers (Zetter, 2011b). At
the same time, Iranian authorities did not retaliate
against the cyberattacks because the identity of the
perpetrators was unknown or unclear and because
there was no precedent on how a state should respond
to such an attack. This inaction made the Iranian
government look weak and appear as an easy target.
Stuxnet had almost no direct effects on the
Iranian population or society itself. The worm was
designed to avoid collateral damage (Rosenbaum,
2012). If the attack had caused collateral damage or had
had more powerful effects, including the potential loss
of human lives, it might have been interpreted as a use
of force and might have led to an escalation of violence
between Iran and the countries it believed to be
responsible (Collins and McCombie, 2012, p. 88;
Rosenbaum, 2012). The biggest impact of Stuxnet on
society was likely a feeling of insecurity, as an intrusion
into a private domain is never taken lightly, and it can
therefore be assumed that Iranians felt betrayed by the
country’s ineffective cybersecurity measures and its
weak stance in regard to the perpetrators. The infection
of Iranian networks proved that even though air-gapped
networks are usually more secure than other networks,
they cannot be considered secure enough (Zetter,
2014). Although the worm only targeted Iranian nuclear
facilities the fact that the malware spread to other

9

Stuxnet

computers around the world contributed to a global
feeling of insecurity.

4.2 Economic effects
This attack also had direct economic effects for
Iran. As Iran is subject to international embargoes, it
does not have access to international markets for buying
nuclear-related materials. In particular, it cannot buy
centrifuges and therefore builds them itself, sometimes
with foreign components. The resulting patchwork of
materials may be one of the reasons for the quick
deterioration of the centrifuges. Being under embargo
also means that Iran has very limited resources, and the
breakage of almost 1,000 centrifuges added pressure on
stocks of materials and budgets. From a cost-benefit
perspective, the poor returns in terms of productivity of
the Natanz nuclear plant may also have added pressure
on government finances, as enriched uranium needed to
be purchased from other countries.
The cyberattack also had long-term economic
repercussions for Iran as it needed to manage delays in
the production of low-enriched uranium. Establishing
new security and cybersecurity measures in nuclear
facilities to avoid the recurrence of an attack such as
Stuxnet would also have required a significant financial
investment. For example, Iran created a new cyberunit
in the Revolutionary Guard Corps to address
cyberattacks in November 2011 (Fogarty, 2011). This
unit is likely to have been behind the cyberattacks of
March 2011 in the USA. A US company selling digital
authentication certificates, Comodo, accused Iran of
attempted cyberattacks on several US companies,
including Google and Microsoft (Lindsay, 2013, p. 397;
Morton, 2013; Peckham, 2011). This attack may have
been in retaliation for the Stuxnet attack, but even
though it seemed to originate from Iran, there was
nothing to prove that it was perpetrated by the new
cyberunit. According to the NSA, Iran may also have
been behind the Shamoon attack, which involved a
worm launched in August 2012 to wipe computers
inside the Saudi oil company Aramco (Zetter, 2015).

4.3 Technological effects
The most direct and only physical effect of
Stuxnet was the damage caused to the centrifuges. The
malware, which was clearly designed to affect the
nuclear facility in Natanz, was believed to affect the
speed of the centrifuges, causing them to alternate
between high and low speeds (Farwell and Rohozinski,
2011, pp. 24–25). This change in speed was masked by
the worm’s rootkit, making the operators believe that
the centrifuges were operating at their normal speed.
The change of speed would have caused the centrifuges
to wear out faster and suffer damage beyond repair.
Natanz had between 6,000 and 9,000 operating

centrifuges at the time, about 1,000 of which needed to
be replaced (De Falco, 2012, p. 23; Nakashima and
Warrick, 2012). IAEA experts assessing the plants noted
that Iran replaced about 10% of its centrifuges each year
due to breakage, but exchanged slightly more
centrifuges than usual between mid-2009 and mid-2010
(Nakashima and Warrick, 2012). ISIS reported that the
level of production of low enriched uranium remained
steady and even increased during the period of the
Stuxnet attack. However, production levels were less
efficient as they could have been with fully working
centrifuges. In other words, the output of low enriched
uranium only increased because of accelerated working
cycles to compensate for the loss of the damaged
centrifuges. Even by February 2010, production levels
were still lower than before the attack in November
2009. It took Iran approximately one year to recover
fully from the effects of the Stuxnet attack and to return
to a level of production comparable to November 2009
(Albright et al., 2010).
Taking these observations into account, the
physical consequences of Stuxnet were rather limited,
but it was probably designed to remain hidden for a
certain amount of time, damage the centrifuges and
then disappear (Nakashima and Warrick, 2012). Its
discovery probably interrupted the process and
terminated the operation prematurely. However, the
fact that the number of damaged centrifuges was only
slightly higher than usual lends strength to the
possibility that the damage might have been caused by
poor manufacturing or normal wear (Albright et al.,
2010).
The Stuxnet attack also directly affected the
technology sector. Companies that had developed
software with vulnerabilities that were exploited to
infect and control the computers in Iran were forced to
react in order to contain the malware. Microsoft issued
patches to solve the relevant zero-day exploits, and
Siemens offered patches and removal tools to
customers to remove Stuxnet in the months following
the discovery of the malware (Langner, 2011, p. 50;
Lindsay, 2013, p. 391). Verisign also reacted within
weeks by revoking the stolen RealTek and JMicron
certificates that were used to trick infected computers
into accepting the worm as a legitimate program
(Lindsay, 2013, p. 394; Matrosov et al., 2010, p. 19).
Inaction by these multinational companies would have
caused their customers to lose confidence in their ability
to produce secure software and technologies.
Moreover, stricter rules for the management of driver
certificates and other digital key systems have since
been issued to prevent the recurrence of malware using
stolen certificates (De Falco, 2012, p. 37).
Long-term technological consequences of
Stuxnet are evident in Iranians approaching technical
malfunctions in their facilities with a greater degree of
mistrust, as any bug or breakdown may raise suspicion
about another cyberattack on Iranian systems. Iran later

10

Stuxnet

discovered two additional pieces of malware operating
stealthily in its networks, namely Duqu and Flame.

4.4 International effects
At the international level, the cyberattack
succeeded in delaying the Iranian uranium-enrichment
program for a short period of time and thus slightly
alleviated associated international tensions. Indeed, it
seems that the resulting delays in the program
reassured Israel sufficiently so that it would not risk
launching an airstrike to physically halt enrichment
(Lindsay, 2013, p. 385).
At the international level, the developer of
Stuxnet, even if its identity remains uncertain, showed
that it is possible to build a highly sophisticated,
offensive cybertool, and that perpetrators have the
resources to accomplish such an attack. Moreover, this
case demonstrates that separating a critical
infrastructure network from the internet can no longer
be considered an adequate security measure. States
have realized that they need to take action in order to
avoid falling victim to attacks of this nature. Several
states, including Iran, subsequently invested in
cybersecurity or created military cyberunits and/or
centers to build up their capabilities in case of an
upcoming cyberwar. Some states also started to review
and update their cyber strategies to cover critical
infrastructures and strengthen their ability to legally
respond to cyberattacks (Dunn Cavelty, 2012, pp. 150–
151).
Another consequence of the Stuxnet cyberattack
was the fact that the worm leaked and spread to other
computers outside Iran. Having the malware in the wild
meant that anybody with the right competences would
be able to reverse-engineer it, modify it to suit other
purposes, sell it or use it (Collins and McCombie, 2012,
p. 89). The possibility of criminal or terrorist groups
starting to use such tools for their own purposes has
been particularly concerning. As a result, the ability to
actively protect systems has also been included in
states’ defense policies, strategies, expenses and
discourses. However, this threat has never materialized
to date. Stuxnet’s code has not been modified and used
for other purposes since it was discovered in 2010.
Modified versions of Stuxnet have not emerged because
it is not possible to simply copy a piece of malware; it
rather needs to be reprogrammed to match new targets,
and finding the necessary resources to achieve this is a
major challenge. Moreover, zero-day exploits used by
Stuxnet ceased to be zero-day vulnerabilities the
moment they were discovered. As a consequence, if
perpetrators wanted to reuse Stuxnet’s code, they
would have to find new zero-day exploits, which would
take time and resources.

5 Policy Consequences
This Section examines the consequences that can
be derived from the discovery of Stuxnet. These
consequences are presented as recommendations for
state actors.

5.1 Improving Cybersecurity
States may wish to focus on improving their
cybersecurity to avoid situations such as Stuxnet
reoccurring. The case of the Stuxnet worm showed that
infecting computers by means of a USB drive is effective
as a means of targeting air-gapped networks. Therefore,
states should particularly focus on computer users and
the issue of using unknown USB drives. States can run
specific awareness-building campaigns on this issue for
workers in critical infrastructures in order to improve
users’ understanding of the risks and possible damage
that such behavior can cause. This would hopefully
promote a more cautious approach to this issue.
States can also improve their cybersecurity by
creating a standard operating procedure for a simplified
and adequate way to respond to a cyberattack. A
relevant procedure could address the technical level
with cybersecurity experts acting rapidly to solve
technical problems resulting from an attack and to
return work cycles to normal as quickly as possible after
an attack. Also, when Iran recognized that it had been
targeted by a cyberattack, there seemed to have been
confusion among the Iranian authorities on how to
respond to the attack politically. Therefore, a standard
operating procedure at the political level could also
provide useful guidance for authorities on how to
respond to a cyberattack perpetrated by another state,
provided that attribution can be confirmed and the
required resources are available.

5.2 Integration of critical infrastructures
in cyber strategy
The damage caused by Stuxnet to the Iranian
centrifuges showed that critical infrastructures can be
targeted by cyberthreats. The fact that the Natanz
networks were separated from other networks did not
sufficiently protect them against the malware. As a
consequence, states should take into account that
critical infrastructures should be integrated in
cybersecurity strategies. Relevant considerations would
result in increased protection against cyberthreats and
higher cybersecurity standards and at the same time
promote closer cooperation between governments and
actors - whether public or private – who manage these
infrastructures. The goal would be to increase
protection against cyberthreats, while also increasing
resilience in case of cyberattacks.

Stuxnet

5.3 Establishment of cybersecurity
standards for industrial equipment
States may wish to promote international
cybersecurity standards for industrial equipment. The
incident of the Stuxnet worm has shown that industrial
equipment such as SCADA systems often suffers from
weak cybersecurity standards and is open to attack
when connected to the internet. To diminish the risk of
these vulnerabilities being exploited, states could
promote technical standards indicating the level of
cybersecurity of connected equipment at the
international level. States could then decide to only use
connected equipment that meets the most stringent
standards in critical infrastructures. States could also
recommend that operators of critical infrastructures not
connect SCADA systems to the internet, as air-gapped
networks remain appropriate for avoiding infection.

5.4 Promotion of international
Confidence Building Measures
(CBMs)
States may wish to reduce mistrust and
misperceptions in cyberspace by promoting
international CBMs. These measures could subsequently
also be used to support the development of
international norms for cyberspace. So far, states have
only agreed to apply international law to states’
activities in cyberspace, respecting principles such as
proportionality or avoiding civilian casualties. However,
the difficulties inherent in the attribution of cyber
activities increase ambiguities and mistrust among
states. CBMs could be a first step towards more
transparency and better international relations. CBMs
could be developed at the bilateral level or at regional
or international levels in fora or international
organizations. Stauffacher and Kavanagh (2013)
suggested a series of such measures for cybersecurity,
which consist of: transparency measures, compliance
indicators and transparency monitoring measures,
cooperative
measures,
communication
and
collaborative mechanisms and restraint measures.
States could then expand such measures into
international norms or treaties.

7 Glossary
Air-gapped network: A security measure that implies
physical separation between a network and the
Internet or other unsecure local networks
(Zetter, 2014).
Cascade: Centrifuges are organized in groups that are
called “cascades” in uranium enrichment
processes (Langner, 2013).
Centrifuge: A centrifuge is a cylinder with a rotating
rotor into which uranium is fed in the form of
isotopic gas. The goal is to use centrifugal force
to separate heavier from lighter gas. The former
becomes depleted and the latter enriched
uranium (Institute for Science and international
Security, n.d.).
Command and Control (C&C): A server through which
the person controlling malware communicates
with it in order to send commands and retrieve
data (QinetiQ Ltd, 2014, p. 2).
Confidence Building Measures (CBMs): Various
procedures that can be established to build trust
and prevent escalation between state actors
(United Nations, n.d.).
Driver certificate: Certification issued by firms to
authenticate their drivers and let computers
know that software is genuine (Matrosov et al.,
2010).
Duqu: Worm discovered in 2011, whose goal was to
steal information (Kushner, 2013).
Flame: Worm discovered in 2012 used to gather
information in countries in the Middle East
(Kushner, 2013).

Low enriched uranium: Essential element to make
nuclear fuel (International Atomic Energy
Agency, 2017).
Malware: Malicious software that can take the form of a
virus, a worm or a Trojan horse (Collins and
McCombie, 2012).
Patch: An update for software that repairs one or more
identified vulnerability(ies) (Ghernaouti-Hélie,
2013, p. 437).
Privilege escalation: Function allowing a remote
computer user to access another computer’s
system by using a guest account (Matrosov et al.,
2010).
Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs): Small
computers controlling electrical functions in
hardware such as switches (Collins and
McCombie, 2012).
Rootkit: Program downloading itself in an infected
system and taking control of certain functions
(Lindsay, 2013).
Shamoon: Computer virus targeting computers from the
energy sector in the Middle East. The Saudi
Arabian national oil company Aramco was
particularly affected by the attack. The virus
wipes the files from an infected computer
rendering it unusable (BBC News, 2012).
Siemens Simatic WinCC/Step-7 software: Industrial
software serving as human-machine interface
(Lindsay, 2013)
Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA):
Computer programs used to control industrial
processes (Langner, 2013, p. 9)
Worm: Standalone, self-replicating program infecting
and spreading to other computers through
networks (Collins and McCombie, 2012).
Zero-day exploit / vulnerabilities: Security vulnerabilities
of which software developers are not aware and
which can be used to hack a system (Karnouskos,
2011).
