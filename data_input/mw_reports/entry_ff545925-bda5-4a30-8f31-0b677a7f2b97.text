Summary

In march, 2011 CERT-Georgia which is Governmental “Computer Emergency Response
Team” of Republic of Georgia has Discovered Cyber Attack Incident, which seems to be Cyber
Espionage Example.
Advanced Malicious Software was Collecting Sensitive, Confidential Information about
Georgian and American Security Documents and then uploading it to some of Command and
Control Servers. (which changes often upon detection).
After investigating Attackers Servers and Malicious Files, we have linked this Cyber Attack to
Russian Official Security Agencies.

After Analysing Webserver, Malicious Files and Various Scripts we found out that:

1. Some of the Georgian NEWS-related sites were Hacked.
(The Malicious script was injected only in the pages, where SPECIFIC
information was presented)
2. After visiting this pages Computer was infected by Unknown Malicious
Program.
(None of Antivirus Product could Identify the threat, by the time of discovery).
3. When executed, Malicious File Fully Controls Infected Computers.
4. Searches for the “Sensitive words” into the Document Files.
5. Makes Video and Audio Capture using built-in camera and microphone.

3|P ag e

Targeted Audience
Cyber Attack was designed very smartly. Various Georgian News-Related web-sites were
hacked and modified only Specific News pages (eg. NATO delegation Visit in Georgia, USGeorgian Agreements and Meetings, Georgian Military NEWS).

Only the persons who was interested in such information were infected with this Advanced
Threat, despite of Security Defensive measure’s and Software used on targets Computer and
Network Systems. Threat was highly encrypted and used contemporary stealthy techniques, so
that none of security tools could identify it.

Malicious file was evolving and Developed time to time:

30 March, 2011 – Virus Steals Sensitive Documents, Certificates

14 September 2011 – Changed Infection Mechanism, new Bypassing methods for
the (Antivirus/Firewall/IDS)

25 November 2011 – Virus is more encrypted and obfuscated. infects windows 7
Operating System

12 December 2011 – added Video Recording capability, scanning and infecting
computers through the Network, changed Spreading vector
It had been evolved from 2.1 version to 5.5.

INFECTING MECHANISM
1) Injected script or iframe into Legitimate Web-site
2) Frame.php from iframe – contained (exploit pack)
3) Drive-By Download & Execution of calc.exe
4) Calc.exe self-destruction injecting code into Explorer.exe
5) Creating persistant usbserv.exe virus

Step 1- injected script

/

exploit pack files

1) We found out that there is crafted and obfuscated frame.php file, which carries some exploit code
and redirects users to other exploit pages:
It uses CVE-2010-0842, CVE-2006-3730, MS06-057 and other unknown vulnerabilities.

2) Exploit code used in frame.php is crypted version of TrojanDownloader:JS/SetSlice, which exploits
MS06-057 Vulnerability by using 'WebViewFolderIcon' ActiveX control (Web View).
3) Also there was some 0day exploit used for exploitation through PDF, JAR files.

Malicious Files Not detected with Major Antivirus Products

After Executing Malware does 3 major things:
- Before installing bot checks if the computer is located in UTC+3, UTC+4

Time-zone:
- injects itself into iexplorer.exe and
communicating to defaced sites, for
C&C address retrival
- creating usbserv.exe bot file in
Application

Counter Cyber-Intelligence
(unmasking the attackers)

CERT-GOV-GE gained full access to Command and Control servers, Decrypted communication
mechanisms and malicious files. After Analyzing all the gathered information we have
identified Cyber attacker persons and organizations.
“During 2008 Cyber War between Russia and Georgia, two Independent US-based Organizations linked Cyber Attackers
with Russian Official Ministries and Organizations.
“United States Cyber Consequences Unit” and “Project Grey Goose”
Jefrey Carr, GreyLogic (cyber Intelligence services for Government Sector)
Sanjay Goel, New York State Center for Information Forensics and Assurance
Mike Himley, CEO/President of Eagle Intelligence
They investigated entire Cyber Attack against Georgia and linked 2008 Cyber Attacks with so-called Cyber-Criminals Group
“Russian Business Network”,
They had reported, that Some of used Internet Resources and Credentials belonged with “Russian Ministry of Defense Research
Institute” called – Center for Research of Military Strength of Foreign Countries.”

In 2011-2012, During This New Cyber Espionage Attack, we have identified
Russian Security agencies, once again.

18 | P a g e

We have found: 3 main facts, which indicate to Russian Official State organizations.

Warynews.ru – site used to control infected Georgian computers – IP and DNS servers
belonges to Russian Business Network. (mentioned in various Blacklist, Bad Reputation)
www.rbc.ru – written directly into MALWARE code, to communicate with Attackers if every
communication channel is closed. Official name “Russian Business Consalting” – official
website, linked with RBN.

“Georbot: From Russia With Love” (with support of our CERT Team)
After That Russian NEWS Agencies Spread Disinformation Based on ESET’s Report Blaming
Georgian Governmental website (which actionly was hacked) for serving malicious files. But
there where nothing said about REAL 6 Command & Controll Servers which were hosted in
various countries and mentioned in ESET’s Report.

21 | P a g e

We have Infected our PC from Lab, then gave Cyber Attacker Fake ZIP Archive with his own
virus inside and the name “Georgian-Nato Agreement”.
Attacker Stole that archive and executed malicious files.
As we had access to BOT Panel, we had maintained control over his PC.
Then captured got video of him, personally. We have captured process of creating new malicious
modules.
We have Obtained Russian Document, from email, where he was giving someone instructions
how to use this malicious software and how to infect targets.
We have linked him with some of German and Russian hackers.
Then we have Obtained information about his destination City, Internet Service Provider, Email
