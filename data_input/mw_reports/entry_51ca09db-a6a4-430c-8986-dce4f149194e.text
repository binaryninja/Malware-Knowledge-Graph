Federal Agency Compromised by Malicious Cyber Actor
us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar20-268a

Summary
This Analysis Report uses the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common
Knowledge (ATT&CK®) framework. See the ATT&CK for Enterprise framework for all
referenced threat actor tactics and techniques.
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) responded to a recent threat
actor’s cyberattack on a federal agency’s enterprise network. By leveraging compromised
credentials, the cyber threat actor implanted sophisticated malware—including multi-stage
malware that evaded the affected agency’s anti-malware protection—and gained persistent
access through two reverse Socket Secure (SOCKS) proxies that exploited weaknesses in
the agency’s firewall.

Description
CISA became aware—via EINSTEIN, CISA’s intrusion detection system that monitors federal
civilian networks—of a potential compromise of a federal agency’s network. In coordination
with the affected agency, CISA conducted an incident response engagement, confirming
malicious activity. The following information is derived exclusively from the incident response
engagement and provides the threat actor’s tactics, techniques, and procedures as well as
indicators of compromise that CISA observed as part of the engagement.
Threat Actor Activity
The cyber threat actor had valid access credentials for multiple users’ Microsoft Office 365
(O365) accounts and domain administrator accounts, which they leveraged for Initial Access
[TA0001] to the agency's network (Valid Accounts [T1078]). First the threat actor logged into
a user’s O365 account from Internet Protocol (IP) address 91.219.236[.]166 and then
browsed pages on a SharePoint site and downloaded a file (Data from Information
Repositories: SharePoint [T1213.002]). The cyber threat actor connected multiple times by
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) from IP address 185.86.151[.]223 to the victim
organization’s virtual private network (VPN) server (Exploit Public-Facing Application
[T1190]).
CISA analysts were not able to determine how the cyber threat actor initially obtained the
credentials. It is possible the cyber actor obtained the credentials from an unpatched agency
VPN server by exploiting a known vulnerability—CVE-2019-11510—in Pulse Secure
(Exploitation for Credential Access [T1212]). In April 2019, Pulse Secure released patches
1/7

for several critical vulnerabilities—including CVE-2019-11510, which allows the remote,
unauthenticated retrieval of files, including passwords.[1] CISA has observed wide
exploitation of CVE-2019-11510 across the federal government.[2]
After initial access, the threat actor performed Discovery [TA0007] by logging into an agency
O365 email account from 91.219.236[.]166 and viewing and downloading help desk
email attachments with “Intranet access” and “VPN passwords” in the subject line, despite
already having privileged access (Email Collection [T1114], Unsecured Credentials:
Credentials In Files [T1552.001]). (Note: these emails did not contain any passwords.) The
actor logged into the same email account via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) from IP
address 207.220.1[.]3 (External Remote Services [T1133]). The actor enumerated the
Active Directory and Group Policy key and changed a registry key for the Group Policy
(Account Manipulation [T1098]). Immediately afterward, the threat actor used common
Microsoft Windows command line processes— conhost , ipconfig , net , query ,
netstat , ping , and whoami , plink.exe —to enumerate the compromised system and
network (Command and Scripting Interpreter [T1059], System Network Configuration
Discovery [T1016]).
The cyber threat actor then attempted multiple times to connect to virtual private server
(VPS) IP 185.86.151[.]223 through a Windows Server Message Block (SMB) client.
Although they connected and disconnected multiple times, the connections were ultimately
successful. During the same period, the actor used an alias secure identifier account they
had previously created to log into VPS 185.86.151[.]223 via an SMB share. The attacker
then executed plink.exe on a victim file server (Command and Scripting Interpreter
[T1059]). ( plink.exe is a command-line version of PuTTy that is used for remote
administration.)
The cyber threat actor established Persistence [TA0003] and Command and Control
[TA0011] on the victim network by (1) creating a persistent Secure Socket Shell (SSH)
tunnel/reverse SOCKS proxy, (2) running inetinfo.exe (a unique, multi-stage malware
used to drop files), and (3) setting up a locally mounted remote share on IP address
78.27.70[.]237 (Proxy [T1090]). The mounted file share allowed the actor to freely move
during its operations while leaving fewer artifacts for forensic analysis. Refer to Threat Actor
Malware section for more information about the SSH Tunnel/reverse SOCKS proxy and
inetinfo.exe .
The cyber threat actor created a local account, which they used for data Collection [TA0009],
Exfiltration [TA0010], Persistence [TA0003], and Command and Control [TA0011] (Create
Account [T1136]). The cyber threat actor used the local account to:
Browse directories on a victim file server (Data from Shared Network Drive [T1039]).

2/7

Copy a file from a user’s home directory to their locally mounted remote share (Data
Staged [T1074]).
CISA analysts detected the cyber threat actor interacting with other files on users’
home directories but could not confirm whether they were exfiltrated.
Create a reverse SMB SOCKS proxy that allowed connection between an cyber threat
actor-controlled VPS and the victim organization’s file server (refer to Threat Actor
Malware section for more information) (Proxy [T1090]).
Interact with PowerShell module Invoke-TmpDavFS.psm (refer to Threat Actor
Malware section for more information).
Exfiltrate data from an account directory and file server directory using tsclient
( tsclient is a Microsoft Windows Terminal Services client) (Data from Local System
[T1005], Data from Network Shared Drive [T1039]).
Create two compressed Zip files with several files and directories on them (Archive
Collected Data [T1560]); it is likely that the cyber threat actor exfiltrated these Zip files,
but this cannot be confirmed because the actor masked their activity.
See figure 1 for the sequence of the cyber threat actor’s tactics and techniques.

Threat Actor Malware
Persistent SSH Tunnel/Reverse SOCKS Proxy

While logged in as “Administrator,” the cyber threat actor created two Scheduled Tasks (see
table 1) that worked in concert to establish a persistent SSH tunnel and reverse SOCKS
proxy. The proxy allowed connections between an attacker-controlled remote server and one
3/7

of the victim organization’s file servers (Scheduled Task/Job [T1053], Proxy [T1090]). The
Reverse SOCKS Proxy communicated through port 8100 (Non-Standard Port [T1571]). This
port is normally closed, but the attacker’s malware opened it.
Table 1: Scheduled Tasks composing SSH tunnel and reverse SOCKS proxy
Scheduled Task

Description

ShellExperienceHost.exe

This task created a persistent SSH tunnel to attackercontrolled remote server 206.189.18[.]189 and
employed port forwarding to allow connections from the
remote server port 39999 to the victim file server through
port 8100. This task was run daily.
ShellExperienceHost.exe is a version of plink.exe ,
a command-line version of PuTTy that is used for remote
administration.

WinDiag.exe

This task is a reverse SOCKS proxy that is preconfigured
to bind to and listen on TCP port 8100. WinDiag.exe
received responses through the SSH tunnel and
forwarded the responses through port 8100 to the VPS IP
address 185.193.127[.]17 over port 443. This task
was run on boot.
WinDiag.exe had compile information that matched the

VPS login name

Dropper Malware: inetinfo.exe
The threat actor created a Scheduled Task to run inetinfo.exe (Scheduled Task/Job [T1053]).
inetinfo.exe is a unique, multi-stage malware used to drop files (figure 2). It dropped
system.dll and 363691858 files and a second instance of inetinfo.exe . The
system.dll from the second instance of inetinfo.exe decrypted 363691858 as
binary from the first instance of inetinfo.exe . The decrypted 363691858 binary was
injected into the second instance of inetinfo.exe to create and connect to a locally
named tunnel. The injected binary then executed shellcode in memory that connected to IP
address 185.142.236[.]198 , which resulted in download and execution of a payload.

4/7

Figure 2: Dropper malware inetinfo.exe
The cyber threat actor was able to overcome the agency’s anti-malware protection, and
inetinfo.exe escaped quarantine. CISA analysts determined that the cyber threat actor
accessed the anti-malware product’s software license key and installation guide and then
visited a directory used by the product for temporary file analysis. After accessing this
directory, the cyber threat actor was able to run inetinfo.exe (Impair Defenses: Disable
or Modify Tools [T1562.001]).
Reverse SMB SOCKS Proxy
PowerShell script HardwareEnumeration.ps1 created a reverse SMB SOCKS proxy that
allowed connection between attacker-controlled VPS IP 185.193.127[.]18 and the victim
organization’s file server over port 443 (Command and Scripting Interpreter: Power Shell
[T1059.001], Proxy [T1090]). PowerShell script HardwareEnumeration.ps1 was executed
daily via a Scheduled Task (Scheduled Task/Job [T1053]).
HardwareEnumeration.ps1 is a copy of Invoke-SocksProxy.ps1 , a free tool created

and distributed by a security researcher on GitHub.[3] Invoke-SocksProxy.ps1 creates a
reverse proxy from the local machine to attacker infrastructure through SMB TCP port 445
(Non-Standard Port [T1571]). The script was likely altered with the cyber threat actor’s
configuration needs.
PowerShell Module: invoke-TmpDavFS.psm

5/7

invoke-TmpDavFS.psm is a PowerShell module that creates a Web Distributed Authoring

and Versioning (WebDAV) server that can be mounted as a file system and communicates
over TCP port 443 and TCP port 80. invoke-TmpDavFS.psm is distributed on GitHub.[4]

Solution
Indicators of Compromise
CISA analysts identified several IP addresses involved in the multiple stages of the outlined
attack.
185.86.151[.]223 – Command and Control (C2)
91.219.236[.]166 – C2
207.220.1[.]3 – C2
78.27.70[.]237 – Data Exfiltration
185.193.127[.]18 – Persistence

Monitor Network Traffic for Unusual Activity
CISA recommends organizations monitor network traffic for the following unusual activity.
Unusual open ports (e.g., port 8100)
Large outbound files
Unexpected and unapproved protocols, especially outbound to the internet (e.g., SSH,
SMB, RDP)
If network defenders note any of the above activity, they should investigate.

Prevention
CISA recommends organizations implement the following recommendations to protect
against activity identified in this report.
Deploy an Enterprise Firewall
Organizations should deploy an enterprise firewall to control what is allowed in and out of
their network.
If the organization chooses not to deploy an enterprise firewall, they should work with their
internet service provider to ensure the firewall is configured properly.
Block Unused Ports
Organizations should conduct a survey of the traffic in and out of their enterprise to
determine the ports needed for organizational functions. They should then configure their
firewall to block unnecessary ports. Organization should develop a change control process to

6/7

make control changes to those rules. Of special note, unused SMB, SSH, and FTP ports
should be blocked.
Additional Recommendations
CISA recommends organizations implement the following best practices.
Implement multi-factor authentication, especially for privileged accounts.
Use separate administrative accounts on separate administration workstations.
Implement the principle of least privilege on data access.
Secure RDP and other remote access solutions using multifactor authentication and
“jump boxes” for access.
Deploy and maintain endpoint defense tools on all endpoints.
Keep software up to date.
