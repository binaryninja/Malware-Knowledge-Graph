Fake Jobs: Campaigns Delivering More_eggs Backdoor via Fake Job Offers

2/11

February 21, 2019 Proofpoint Threat Insight Team
Overview
Since the middle of 2018, Proofpoint has been tracking campaigns abusing legitimate messaging
services, offering fake jobs, and repeatedly following up via email to ultimately deliver the More_eggs
backdoor. These campaigns primarily targeted US companies in various industries including retail,
entertainment, pharmacy, and others that commonly employ online payments, such as online shopping
portals.
The actor sending these campaigns attempts to establish rapport with potential victims by abusing
LinkedIn’s direct messaging service. In direct follow-up emails, the actor pretends to be from a staffing
company with an offer of employment. In many cases, the actor supports the campaigns with fake
websites that impersonate legitimate staffing companies. These websites, however, host the malicious
payloads. In other cases, the actor uses a range of malicious attachments to distribute More_eggs.
We also believe that the same actor recently sent related campaigns, first noted by Brian Krebs, targeting
anti-money laundering officers at financial institutions [1].
Delivery
We have observed a number of variations among the campaigns, but most share common
characteristics. While not exhaustive, the general flow as well as specific examples of these attacks are
described below.
Initially the actor uses a fraudulent, but legitimately created LinkedIn profile to initiate contact with
individuals at the targeted company by sending invitations with a short message (Figure 1). This appears
as a benign email with the subject “Hi [Name], please add me to your professional network”.

Figure 1: Example of initial message in which attackers abuse LinkedIn messaging.
Within a week, the actor sends a direct email to the target’s work address reminding the recipient about
the prior attempt to communicate on LinkedIn (Figure 2). It uses the target’s professional title, as it
appears on LinkedIn, as the subject, and often suggests the recipient click on a link to see the noted job
description. In other cases, this actor used an attached PDF with embedded URLs or other malicious
attachments.

Figure 2: Example follow up email to the target’s work address, with a malicious URL.
The URLs link to a landing page that spoofs a real talent and staffing management company, using stolen
branding to enhance the legitimacy of the campaigns (Figure 3). The landing page initiates a download of
a Microsoft Word file (Figure 4) with malicious macros created with Taurus Builder (described below). If
the recipient enables macros, the “More_eggs” payload will be downloaded and executed. In other cases,
the landing page may initiate the download of a JScript loader instead, but this intermediate malware still
ultimately results in the delivery of More_eggs.

domain for a talent management agency. This one specifically initiates a download of a malicious
Microsoft Word document.

As noted, some campaigns also used malicious attachments instead of URLs in the email. Figure 5
shows an example of one such attachment, a PDF with a link to a spoofed landing page like that shown
in Figure 3.

Variations
These campaigns demonstrated considerable variability, with the actor frequently changing delivery
methods and more. Examples of the types of techniques used by the actor to deliver the final More_eggs
payload include:

URL linking to a landing page that initiates the download for an intermediate JScript loader or
Microsoft Word document with macros or exploits
URL shortener redirecting to the same landing page
PDF attachment with a URL linking to the same landing page
Password-protected Microsoft Word attachment with macros that download More_eggs
Completely benign emails without a malicious attachment or URL attempting to further establish
rapport (Figure 6)

Tools
This actor uses a variety of tools to distribute malware. We briefly describe three such tools below.
Taurus Builder
We use this name to describe a tool used to create malicious documents. We believe Taurus builder was
purchased on underground crime forums. Notably, documents created with this builder use the CMSTP
bypass as described in [2]. Both Palo Alto Networks [3] and QuoScient [4] have previously described
documents created with this kit.
VenomKit
We use this name to describe documents generated by a builder purchased from the same seller as
Taurus builder. Depending on the variant it may exploit CVE-2017-0199, CVE-2017-8570, CVE-20178759, CVE-2017-11882, CVE-2018-0802, and/or CVE-2018-8174. Notably, VenomKit often also uses the
same CMSTP bypass as Taurus. Documents from this kit have previously been discussed by Quoscient
[4].
More_eggs

8/11

More_eggs is malware written in JScript used in these campaigns and others. It is often used as a
downloader. In addition to its ability to download additional payloads, More_eggs has extensive
capabilities to profile the infected machine. The malware was first documented by Trend Micro [5].
Overlaps with Anti-Money Laundering Campaign
Brian Krebs wrote about a related campaign that targeted anti-money laundering officers at financial
institutions that we believe may have been sent by the same actor. Although targeting and the final
payload were different in the campaign he described, key similarities to campaigns describe above
included:
The use of a similar PDF email attachment to the PDFs used in the Fake Jobs campaigns
The PDFs of both the anti-money laundering campaign and the Fake Jobs campaigns at one point
included URLs hosted on the same domain
Large Follow-up Spam Campaign
Note: As we were finalizing this report we observed a larger than usual campaign from this actor on Feb
21, 2019, from random senders, with a malicious URL in the email.
Conclusion
As threat actors continue to turn away from very large-scale “spray and pray” campaigns and focus on
persistent infections with downloaders, RATs, bankers, and other malware, increasingly sophisticated
social engineering and stealthy malware are making their way into a range of campaigns. This actor
provides compelling examples of these new approaches, using LinkedIn scraping, multi-vector and
multistep contacts with recipients, personalized lures, and varied attack techniques to distribute the
More_eggs downloader, which in turn can distribute the malware of their choice based on system profiles
transmitted to the threat actor. In response to the increasing effectiveness of layered defenses and end
user education efforts, we can expect more threat actors to adopt approaches that improve the
effectiveness of their lures and increase the likelihood of high-quality infections.
Note: We have informed all affected parties about the abuse of their services and brands in these
campaigns.
