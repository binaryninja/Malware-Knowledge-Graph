FORWARD
Rarely in the infosec industry do cyber investigators get the luxury of knowing the full scope of their
adversary’s campaign—from tasking, to actual operations, all the way to completion. The oft-repeated
mantra “Attribution is hard” largely stands true. Short of kicking down the door just as a cyber actor
pushes enter, it is frustratingly hard to prove who is responsible for cyber attacks with 100% certainty.
However, a series of recent U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) indictments released over the course of
two years, combined with CrowdStrike Intelligence’s own research, has allowed for startling visibility
into a facet of China’s shadowy intelligence apparatus.
In this blog, we take a look at how Beijing used a mixture of cyber actors sourced from China’s
underground hacking scene, Ministry of State Security (MSS/国安部) officers, company insiders, and state
directives to fill key technology and intelligence gaps in a bid to bolster dual-use turbine engines which
could be used for both energy generation and to enable its narrow-body twinjet airliner, the C919, to
compete against western aerospace firms. What follows is a remarkable tale of traditional espionage,
cyber intrusions, and cover-ups, all of which overlap with activity CrowdStrike Intelligence has previously
attributed to the China-based adversary TURBINE PANDA. These operations are ultimately traceable
back to the MSS Jiangsu Bureau, the likely perpetrators of the infamous 2015 U.S. Office of Personnel
Management (OPM) breach.

PART I: THE TARGET
The story starts with a simple fact: Beijing accurately predicted that due to its rising economic status,
China’s middle class demand for air travel would far outpace its ability to supply aircraft and a domestic
commercial aviation industry capable of supporting these logistics. Putting aside the obvious militarycivil (军民融合) benefits1 that turbine engines have for the energy and aviation sectors, much of China’s
strategic push into this industry is predicated by necessity. China is predicted2 to succeed the U.S. as the
world’s largest aviation market by 2022, adding nearly 1 billion passengers by 2036. From China’s 12th
and 13th Five Year Plan to the increasingly scrutinized Made in China 2025 Plan,3 numerous state
strategic plans have named aerospace and aviation equipment as one of ten priority industries to focus
on “leap-frog” developments.

A major focus of this strategy centered on building an indigenous Chinese-built commercial aircraft
designed to compete with the duopoly of western aerospace. That aircraft would become the C919—an
aircraft roughly half the cost of its competitors, and which completed its first maiden flight4 in 2017 after
years of delays due to design flaws. But the C919 can hardly be seen as a complete domestic triumph as

it is reliant on a plethora of foreign-manufactured components (see Figure 3).5 Likely in an effort to
bridge those gaps, a Chinese state-aligned adversary CrowdStrike calls TURBINE PANDA conducted cyber
intrusions from a period of roughly 2010 to 2015 against several of the companies that make the C919’s
various components.

Specifically, in December 2009, the state-owned enterprise (SOE) Commercial Aircraft Corporation of
China (COMAC/中国商用飞机有限责任公司) announced it had chosen CFM International’s (a joint venture
between U.S.-based GE Aviation and French aerospace firm Safran, formerly Snecma) LEAP-X engine to
provide a custom variant engine, the LEAP-1C, for the then-newly announced C919. The deal was
reportedly signed in Beijing during a visit by then-French Prime Minister François Fillon.6 Despite the
early deal with CFM, both COMAC and fellow SOE the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC/中国
航空工业集团公司) were believed7 to be tasked by China’s State-owned Assets Supervision and
Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC) with building an “indigenously created”
turbofan engine that was comparable to the LEAP-X.8
In August 2016, both COMAC and AVIC became the main shareholders of the Aero Engine Corporation
of China (AECC/中国航空发动机集团), which produced the CJ-1000AX engine. The CJ-1000AX bears

multiple similarities to the LEAP-1C,9 including its dimensions10 and turbofan blades. The AECC
conducted its first test as recently as May 2018, having overcome significant difficulties in their first
mockups. Though it is difficult to assess that the CJ-1000AX is a direct copy of the LEAP-X without direct
access to technical engineering specifications, it is highly likely that its makers benefited significantly
from the cyber espionage efforts of the MSS, detailed further in subsequent blog installments, knocking
several years (and potentially billions of dollars) off of its development time.
The actual process by which the CCP and its SOEs provide China’s intelligence services with key
technology gaps for collection is relatively opaque, but what is known from CrowdStrike Intelligence
reporting and corroborating U.S. government reporting11 is that Beijing uses a multi-faceted system of
forced technology transfer, joint ventures, physical theft of intellectual property from insiders, and
cyber-enabled espionage to acquire the information it needs. Specifically, SOEs are believed to help
identify major intelligence gaps in key projects of significance that China’s intelligence services then are
likely tasked with collecting. It is assessed with high confidence that the MSS was ultimately tasked with
targeting firms that had technologies pertaining to the LEAP-X engine and other components of the
C919, based on timing and the details revealed in the DoJ indictments. For example, the first
preparatory activity in January 2010 believed to be associated with TURBINE PANDA targeted Los
Angeles-based Capstone Turbine and began just a month after choosing CFM as its engine provider.
This brings us to our culprits: the Jiangsu Bureau of the MSS (JSSD/江苏省国家安全厅) located in Nanjing.
In Part II, we will discuss the JSSD’s location, and its joint operations between the JSSD’s cyber operators
and its human intelligence officers.

PART II: THE CULPRITS
From August 2017 until October 2018, the DoJ released several separate, but related indictments
against Sakula developer YU Pingan12, JSSD Intelligence Officer XU Yanjun13, GE Employee and insider
ZHENG Xiaoqing14, U.S. Army Reservist and assessor JI Chaoqun15, and 10 JSSD-affiliated cyber operators
in the ZHANG et. al. indictment16. What makes these DoJ cases so fascinating is that, when looked at as a
whole, they illustrate the broad, but coordinated efforts the JSSD took to collect information from its
aerospace targets. In particular, the operations connected to activity CrowdStrike Intelligence tracked as
TURBINE PANDA showed both traditional human-intelligence (HUMINT) operators and its cyber
operators working in parallel to pilfer the secrets of several international aerospace firms.

As discussed in the previous section, it is believed that cyber targeting of aerospace firms by TURBINE
PANDA cyber operators began in January 2010, almost immediately after the LEAP-X engine was chosen
for the C919. The ZHANG indictment describes initial preparatory action that included compromising Los
Angeles-based Capstone Turbine servers and later using a doppelganger site as a strategic web
compromise (SWC) in combination with DNS hijacking (including a specific technique the indictment
points out may have been borrowed from the Syrian Electronic Army/DEADEYE JACKAL17) to
compromise other aerospace firms. From a period of 2010 to 2015, the linked JSSD operators are
believed to have targeted a variety of aerospace-related targets—including Honeywell, Safran, and
several other firms18, 19—using two China-based APT favorites, PlugX and Winnti, and malware assessed
to be unique to the group dubbed Sakula.
The same ZHANG indictment indicates that these operations were overseen by CHAI Meng (柴萌), who
likely managed the JSSD’s cyber operators as a pseudo Cyber Section Chief. Reporting to CHAI was the
cyber operator team lead, LIU Chunliang (刘春亮/sxpdlc1r/Fangshou), who appeared to establish and
maintain much of the infrastructure used in the attacks on various aerospace targets as well as organize
the intrusions conducted by the operators ZHANG Zhanggui (张长贵/Ieanovr/Ieaonr), GAO Hongkun (高洪
坤/Mer4en7y), ZHUANG Xiaowei (庄枭伟/jpxxav), MA Zhiqi (马志琪/Le Ma), and LI Xiao (李潇/zhuan86).
Many of these individuals are assessed to have storied histories in legacy underground hacking circles
within China dating back to at least 2004.
Notably, LIU also appeared to broker the use of Sakula from its developer YU, as well as the malware
IsSpace (associated with SAMURAI PANDA) from its likely developer ZHUANG.20 LIU and YU’s
conversations about Sakula would be a critical factor in tying all of this disparate activity together as
Sakula was believed to be unique to the JSSD operators and could be used to tie several aerospace
intrusion operations into a single, long-running campaign.

JSSD’s HUMINT Efforts
Simultaneously, there was a HUMINT element to the JSSD’s espionage operations against aerospace
targets. XU Yanjun, was identified in his indictment21 as the Deputy Division Director of the Sixth Bureau
of the JSSD in charge of Insider Threats. XU affiliated himself with two cover organizations—Jiangsu
Science and Technology Association (JAST) and the Nanjing Science & Technology Association (NAST)—
when interacting with potential targets. XU also was reported as frequently associating with the Nanjing
University of Aeronautics and Astronomics (NUAA), a significant national defense university controlled
by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), that interfaces directly with many of
China’s top defense firms and state-owned enterprises. It is likely no coincidence that NUAA is a regular
collaborator with state-owned enterprises (SOEs) COMAC and AVIC, the main shareholders of AECC,
which went on to produce the LEAP-X inspired CJ1000-AX turbine engine for the C919.

Figure 5. MSS Intelligence Officer and Deputy Division Director XU Yanjun
Over the course of several years, XU would recruit both an insider at LEAP-X manufacturer General
Electric (GE), ZHENG Xiaoqing, and a Chinese-born Army reservist, JI Chaoqun (季超群). ZHENG’s
background appears to have made him uniquely qualified to accurately assess turbine engine
schematics, and it was clear from his indictment that he had received coaching on which sensitive
information on GE’s turbine technology to access and how to use steganography in an attempt to
exfiltrate the information. JI, who entered the U.S. on an F-1 student visa to study electrical engineering
in Chicago, was approached by XU (initially undercover as an NUAA professor) in December 2013 and
eventually recruited to provide assessments on other high-value individuals in the aerospace industry
for potential recruitment by the MSS. JI’s position in the U.S. Army Reserve program known as Military
Accessions Vital to the National Interest (MAVNI) provided a perfect cover for JI’s assessment activities,
as the program focuses on potential recruitment of foreign citizens with skills pertinent to national
interest and legally residing in the U.S. Had it been successful, JI would have been handing XU other
foreign-born recruitment candidates as they were about to enter U.S. military service on potentially
sensitive projects.

HUMINT-Enabled Cyber Operations and the Role of CrowdStrike’s
Own Blog
In February 2014, one of our own blogs described the relationship between cyber activity in 2012
against Capstone Turbine and an SWC targeting Safran/Snecma carried out by TURBINE PANDA,
potentially exposing the HUMINT-enabled cyber operations described in some of the indictments. As
described in the ZHANG indictment, on 26 February 2014, one day after the release of our “French
Connection” blog publicly exposed some of TURBINE PANDA’s operations, intel officer XU texted his
JSSD counterpart, cyber director CHAI, asking if the domain ns24.dnsdojo.com was related to their cyber
operations. That domain was one of the few controlled by cyber operator lead LIU, and several hours
after CHAI responded to XU’s text that he would verify, the domain name was deleted.
According to the ZHANG indictment, The deletion was believed to be carried out by GU Gen (顾根),
Safran’s Suzhou Branch IT manager, when Safran began investigating beaconing from that domain
following the blog post and notification from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). GU had been

previously recruited around January 2014 by XU, and was able to act as a fixer for LIU and his team’s
operations. The indictment also showed that XU had also previously recruited another Safran Suzhou
insider named TIAN Xi (田曦) in November 2013, giving him a USB drive with Sakula on it. On 25 January
2014, TIAN communicated to XU that he had installed Sakula on Safran’s networks, and XU in turn
texted confirmation to CHAI, who’s team subsequently began their operations on Safran’s networks
over the next month.

Where is the JSSD?
Though not much is publicly known about the internal organizational structure of China’s secretive
national intelligence service, the MSS is known to operate a number of large municipal bureaus,
normally located in the provincial capitals. Through a mixture of open-source research and confirmation
from sensitive source reporting, CrowdStrike Intelligence confirmed two locations that the JSSD likely
operates out of:
1. Approximately 32°3'34.25"N, 118°45'41.83"E in the Gulou District of Nanjing - 江苏省南京市鼓楼区扬州
路 1 号. Co-located in the headquarters of the Jiangsu Ministry of Public Security (MPS/公安部)

Tellingly, the listed address of the JSSD’s kindergarten is 50 Ninghai road, Gulou District (江苏省南京市鼓楼
区宁海路 50 号), a building very near to the Jiangsu MPS headquarters.23 Furthermore, MSS facilities are
believed to often be co-located in MPS buildings both to provide plausible cover and due to their
overlapping work on domestic security.

A particular Nanjing architectural firm appears fairly proud of the job it did on this JSSD compound (see
above), and prominently features pictures of architectural mockups of the building’s outside, atrium,
and even its gym as splash pages on its main site.24 Again, the JSSD hanzi (江苏省国家安全厅) are directly
on the site along with indications that it was built in 2009. A comparison with the street view25 (see
Figure 8) and corroboration with sensitive source reporting gives us fairly high confidence that this
building and location is affiliated with the JSSD. A satellite view shows an array of satellite dishes out
front as well.

Mockup
In the next section, we’ll discuss the aftermath of these operations, their connection to other Chinese
cyber campaigns, and how they fit into China’s larger strategy of “leapfrog” development.

PART III: THE AFTERMATH
The arrests of MSS officer XU Yanjun, his insiders (ZHENG Xiaoqing and JI Chaoqun), and Sakula
developer YU Pingan will ultimately not deter Beijing from mounting other significant cyber campaigns
designed to achieve leapfrog development in areas they perceive to be of strategic importance. Though
XU’s arrest in particular was likely a massive boon to U.S. intelligence given he was the first MSS officer
(not simply an asset) known to be arrested, China has not ceased cyber operations even after incidents
tying GOTHIC PANDA26 and STONE PANDA27 to the MSS were exposed publicly.
The reality is that many of the other cyber operators that made up TURBINE PANDA operations will
likely never see a jail cell. YU was arrested in 2017 following his attendance at a U.S.-based security
conference, and CrowdStrike Intelligence sensitive source reporting indicated that following his arrest,
the MSS issued strict orders for China’s security researchers to be barred from participating in overseas
conferences or Capture the Flag competitions, likely fearing a repeat occurrence and more arrests of its
offensive talents.
In years prior to that directive, Chinese teams—such as those from Qihoo 360, Tencent, and Baidu—had
dominated overseas competitions and bug bounties including Pwn2Own and CanSecWest, earning
thousands of dollars in cash rewards for their zero-day exploits for popular systems such as Android, iOS,
Tesla, Microsoft, and Adobe. Instead, the companies these researchers work for were required to
provide vulnerability information to the China Information Technical Security Evaluation Center

(CNITSEC/中国信息安全测评中心). CNITSEC was previously identified by CrowdStrike Intelligence and other
industry reporting28 as being affiliated with the MSS Technical Bureau and it runs the Chinese National
Information Security Vulnerability Database (CNNVD/中国国家信息安全漏洞库), which was outed for its
role in providing the MSS with cutting-edge vulnerabilities likely for use in offensive operations.29
However, even before this directive, it is likely that many of the vulnerabilities used in offensive MSS
operations came from these researchers. Many of the senior security researchers and executives at
Chinese security firms got their start in legacy domestic hacking groups such as Xfocus and went on to
turn their talents into successful careers—some whitehat, some blackhat, and the large majority
probably falling somewhere in the grey area. The majority of these firms are listed partners of the
CNNVD (see the image below). NSFOCUS, for example, was formed out of the remnants of the
commercialized faction of China’s patriotic hacking group the Green Army; its hanzi characters are
actually still the same as the original group’s name. Venustech and Topsec were both listed as known
Chinese state-affiliated contractors in leaked U.S. government cable. Topsec was also linked to
campaigns against the aerospace sector and Anthem breaches in public reporting.30

Figure 9. Prominent Chinese Tech Firms Partnering with the MSS-Affiliated

What is notable about the use of certain vulnerabilities and strains of malware sourced from the Chinese
underground is that they often uniquely indicate which actors are responsible for which campaigns. In
this case, Sakula is described in the YU indictment as being relatively unique and was provided to JSSD

lead operator LIU Chunliang by YU along with multiple other vulnerabilities that were used against
aerospace firms by LIU and other cyber operators that comprised TURBINE PANDA operations. The
usage of Sakula across multiple victims and the arrest of its developer, YU, by the FBI would prove
critical for several reasons.
Industry reporting31 outlined the overlapping similarities between activity at one of TURBINE PANDA’s
victims that exhibited certain tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and the usage of Sakula in the
Anthem breach publicly disclosed in 2015. As indicated by an FBI Flash Report32 detailing the tools used
in the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) intrusion, Sakula was named along with FFRAT and
the IsSpace malware (tracked by CrowdStrike Intelligence as being used by SAMURAI PANDA and also
connected to JSSD operators in the ZHANG indictment via cyber operator ZHUANG Xiaowei) in the OPM
case, likely indicating the JSSD was also behind these operations.
Public reporting has long theorized that the same operators were behind the Anthem and OPM
incidents, and that both operations were likely perpetrated by actors affiliated with the MSS. Further
reporting tied a breach at United Airlines to the same group that perpetrated Anthem and OPM,
reaffirming that those actors had interests in aviation as well.33 It is likely that the DoJ indictments
provided yet another piece to this complicated puzzle that saw the pilfering of the data of millions of
cleared U.S. government workers funneled to China, a veritable intelligence gold-mine for recruiting
potential future spies.

The Bigger Picture
Even with the arrest of a senior MSS intelligence officer and a valuable malware developer, the potential
benefits of cyber-enabled espionage to China’s key strategic goals has seemingly outweighed the
consequences to date. Beijing still has a long way to go before it has a completely independent domestic
commercial aviation industry, as evidenced by the $45 billion USD deal to purchase 300 Airbus planes
during President XI Jinping’s recent visit to France.34 XI inked a similar purchase agreement for 300
Boeing planes during a November 2017 visit to the U.S. Yet China still seeks to decrease its dependency
on this duopoly and eventually compete on an even footing with them. Notably, China was the first
country to ground Boeing’s 737 MAX and tout its own air safety records, following a second deadly 737
MAX crash this year.35
In May 2017, weeks after the C919’s successful maiden flight in China, AECC and Russia’s United Aircraft
Corp (UAC) announced a 50-50 joint venture (JV) called China-Russia Commercial Aircraft International
Corp (CRAIC) to fund and design a new aircraft dubbed CR929 (see Figure 10), a wide-body jet designed
to compete with the Airbus 350 and Boeing 787.36 Though both countries will design much of the

aircraft, the CR929’s engines, onboard electrical systems, and other components will still likely need to
be supplied by foreign suppliers.37

Figure 10. CR929 Airliner
Source: Reuters

Similar to the procedure for developing the C919, the JV is currently taking bids for an aircraft engine
that will be used until a Chinese-Russian substitute can take its place; this appears likely to be the CJ2000, an upgraded version of the CJ-1000AX used in the C919. Finalists in the bidding process may face
additional targeting from China-based adversaries that have demonstrated the capability and intent to
engage in such intellectual property theft for economic gain. It is unclear whether Russia, a state that
also has experienced cyber operators at its disposal, would also engage in cyber-enabled theft of
intellectual property related to the CR929.
The C919 still faces significant barriers to entry—namely, international certification and the current
Sino-U.S. trade war. COMAC aims to have the C919 pass grueling certification standards by the end of
2020.
Notably, public reporting in February 2019 detailed a potential cover-up involving a November 2016
cyber intrusion at the Canada-based International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the United Nations
(UN) body that sets global civil aviation standards.38 The documents indicate that the intrusion at ICAO
was likely designed to facilitate a strategic web compromise (SWC) attack (similar to what TURBINE

PANDA did with Capstone Turbine and described in Part II of this series) that would easily provide a
springboard to target a plethora of other aerospace-related as well as foreign government victims. Upon
being alerted to the breach by the Aviation Information Sharing and Analysis Center (AISAC), the ICAO
internal IT investigation staff was reportedly grossly negligent, and the cyber intruders may have had
direct access to one of their superuser accounts. In addition, a file containing a list of all the potential
organizations who were compromised by the incident mysteriously disappeared during further

Outside, third-party investigations point to China-based EMISSARY PANDA as the culprit. CrowdStrike
Intelligence is unable to independently confirm this; however, EMISSARY PANDA has been previously
observed targeting the aviation industry as well. Both the ICAO IT supervisor in charge of the mishandled
internal investigation, James WAN, and Fang LIU, the ICAO’s secretary general who shelved
recommendations to investigate WAN and his four team members, were both found by CrowdStrike to
have ties to China’s aviation industry. LIU previously was a major figure at the Civil Aviation
Administration of China (CAAC), one of several prominent Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs)
tasked with advancing China’s aviation industry.39 WAN was previously connected to the Civil Aviation
University of China (CUAC), another prominent institution in China’s aviation industry research that is
administered by CAAC. Though CrowdStrike Intelligence cannot make any high confidence
determinations about the breach, the timing in 2016, the techniques (such as attempting an upstream
SWC to target other industry victims), and the nature of the intrusion into ICAO is an eerily similar
situation to GU Gen, the MSS-recruited IT manager at Safran’s Suzhou branch who sought to cover up

TURBINE PANDA operations (see the previous blog post). LIU, WAN, and the four employees are all still
employed at ICAO.
A major facet of the current Sino-U.S. trade war is forced technology transfer, which Beijing has used to
great effect by siphoning intellectual property from foreign firms in exchange for providing joint
ventures (JVs) and granting access to China’s lucrative market, only to be forced out later by domestic
rivals as they grow competitive with state subsidies and support. Under current laws, the C919’s foreign
suppliers (many of whom were targets of TURBINE PANDA operations) are required to physically
assemble components in China through a JV with COMAC.40
It remains to be seen whether the high-level Sino-U.S. trade negotiations will result in limiting Beijing’s
ability to speed its aviation development through JVs, forced technology transfer, HUMINT operations,
or cyber-enabled theft of IP. But the unprecedented visibility into how the MSS and its cyber operators
enhance China’s leapfrog development coming at this time is more than just a coincidence.
