Around July last year, more than a 100 Israeli servicemen were hit by a cunning threat actor. The attack compromised
their devices and exfiltrated data to the attackers’ command and control server. In addition, the compromised devices
were pushed Trojan updates, which allowed the attackers to extend their capabilities. The operation remains active at the
time of writing this post, with attacks reported as recently as February 2017.
The campaign, which experts believe is still in its early stages, targets Android OS devices. Once the device is
compromised, a process of sophisticated intelligence gathering starts, exploiting the ability to access the phone’s video
and audio capabilities, SMS functions and location.
The campaign relies heavily on social engineering techniques, leveraging social networks to lure targeted soldiers into
both sharing confidential information and downloading the malicious applications.
Characterized by relatively unsophisticated technical merit, and extensive use of social engineering, the threat actor
targets only IDF soldiers.
IDF C4I & the IDF Information Security Department unit, with Kaspersky Lab researchers, have obtained a list of the
victims; among them IDF servicemen of different ranks, most of them serving around the Gaza strip.

Attack Flow
1/6

The operation follows the same infection flow across the different victims:

Figure 1: Campaign’s attack flow

Social Engineering
The threat actor uses social engineering to lure targets into installing a malicious application, while continuously
attempting to acquire confidential information using social networks. We’ve seen a lot of the group’s activity on Facebook
Messenger. Most of the avatars (virtual participants in the social engineering stage) lure the victims using sexual
innuendo, e.g. asking the victim to send explicit photos, and in return sending fake photos of teenage girls. The avatars
pretend to be from different countries such as Canada, Germany, Switzerland and more.

Dropper
After the victim downloads the APK file from the malicious URL, the attacker expects the victim to install the package
manually. The dropper requires common user permissions as shown in the following screenshot.

Key features
The dropper relies on the configuration server which uses queries in order to download the best fitting payload for the
specified device.
Downloader & Watchdog of the main payload
Payload update mechanism
Customized payload – the dropper sends a list of installed apps, and receives a payload package based on it
Obfuscation – The dropper package is obfuscated using ProGuard, which is an open source code obfuscator and
Java optimizer, observed in the LoveSongs dropper.

2/6

Network Protocols
The network protocol between the dropper and the configuration server is based on HTTP POST requests. The following
servers implement a RESTful API:
LoveSongs – http://endpointup[.]com/update/upfolder/updatefun.php
YeeCall, WowoMessanger – http://droidback[.]com/pockemon/squirtle/functions.php

Figure 3: Communication with C&C server over HTTP
Most of the communication with the server is in clear-text, except for specific commands which are encrypted using an
AES-128 hard coded-key.

3/6

Along with an ID existence check, the dropper sends a list of the device’s installed apps – if it hasn’t done so already.
The flow between different variants of the dropper is similar, with minor changes. One variant pretends to be a YouTube
player, while others are chat apps:
LoveSongs has YouTube player functionality, whereas WowoMessanger does not have any legitimate functionality
whatsoever; it erases its icon after the first run.

Payload
The payload is installed after one of the droppers mentioned above has been downloaded and executed on the victim
device. The only payload we have seen so far is “WhatsApp_Update”.
The payload is capable of two collection mechanisms:
Execute “On demand” commands – manual commands that are triggered by the operator
Scheduled process – scheduled tasks that collect information periodically from various sources.
Most of the collected data will be sent only when a WI-FI network is available.

C&C Commands
The payload uses the WebSocket protocol, which gives the attacker a real-time interface to send commands to the
payload in a way that resembles ‘reverse shell’. Some of the commands are not yet implemented (as shown in the table
below). The commands gives the operator basic yet dangerous RAT capabilities:
Collect general information about the device e.g. Network operator, GPS location, IMEI etc.
Open a browser and browse to a chosen URL
Read & send SMS messages, and access contacts
Eavesdrop at a specific time and period
Take pictures (using the camera) or screenshots
Record video and audio.

Scheduled Process
Besides the C&C commands, the payload periodically collects data using various Android APIs. The default time interval
is 30 seconds. The process collects the following data:

4/6

General data about the device (as mentioned in the C&C command)
SMS messages, WhatsApp database along with the encryption key (requires root permissions which is not yet fully
implemented)
Browsing & search history along with bookmarks
Documents and archives ( < 2MB ) found in storage (doc, docx, ppt, rar, etc)
Pictures taken, auto captures while on an active call
List of contacts and call logs
Records calls and eavesdrops
Updates itself
The attackers implemented all of the malicious logic without any native or third-party sources. The logic behind the
automatic call-recording feature is implemented entirely using Android’s API.

Conclusions
The IDF, which led the research along with Kaspersky Lab researchers, has concluded that this is only the opening shot
of this operation. Further, that it is by definition a targeted attack against the Israeli Defense Force, aiming to exfiltrate
data on how ground forces are spread, which tactics and equipment the IDF is using and real-time intelligence gathering.
Kaspersky Lab GReAT researchers will disclose more behind-the-scenes details of the operation at the upcoming
Security Analyst Summit.
