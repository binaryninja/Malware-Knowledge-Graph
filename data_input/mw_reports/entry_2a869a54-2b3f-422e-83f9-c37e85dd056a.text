EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
• ShadowPad is a privately sold modular malware platform –rather than an
open attack framework– with plugins sold separately.
• ShadowPad is still regularly updated with more advanced anti-detection
and persistence techniques.
• It’s used by at least four clusters of espionage activity. ShadowPad was the
primary backdoor for espionage operations in multiple campaigns, including
the CCleaner, NetSarang, and ASUS supply-chain attacks.
• The adoption of ShadowPad significantly reduces the costs of development and
maintenance for threat actors. We observed that some threat groups stopped
developing their own backdoors after they gained access to ShadowPad.
• As a byproduct of that shared tooling, any claim on attribution needs
to be reviewed in a cautious way when a shared backdoor like ShadowPad
is involved.
• Instead of focusing on specific threat groups, we discuss local personas
possibly involved in the development of ShadowPad as an iterative
successor to PlugX.

OVERVIEW
ShadowPad emerged in 2015 as the successor to PlugX. However, it was not
until several infamous supply-chain incidents occurred – CCleaner, NetSarang
and ShadowHammer – that it started to receive widespread attention in the
public domain. Unlike the publicly-sold PlugX, ShadowPad is privately shared
among a limited set of users. Its plugin-based design and the capability of
inserting plugins during runtime give it good extensibility on the functionalities
for its users. Whilst collecting IoCs and connecting the dots, we asked
ourselves: What threat actors are using ShadowPad in their operations? And
ultimately, how does the emergence of ShadowPad impact the wider threat
landscape from Chinese espionage actors?
To answer those questions, we conducted a comprehensive study on the origin,
usage and ecosystem of ShadowPad. First, this report provides a detailed
overview of ShadowPad, including the technical details and our assessment
of its business model and ecosystem. Furthermore, in this whitepaper we
introduce at least four activity clusters where ShadowPad has been used.
Finally, we share how its emergence changes the attacking strategies of some
China-based threat actors and how it affects the threat landscape of Chinese
espionage attacks.

HISTORY
PlugX is a fully-featured and modular backdoor in shellcode format, first
discovered in 2008 1. It was named by the security community based on its
plugin-based design. Although it is formed of various plugins, it does not allow
the plugging and unplugging of those plugins during runtime. It was widely
used by different threat groups after its emergence, and nowadays whilst still
deployed in some espionage campaigns, it sees significantly less usage due to
the popularity of the malware and therefore its detectability.
The relationship between PlugX and ShadowPad has been publicly discussed
before 2. However, SentinelOne discovered other evidence proving that
ShadowPad is highly likely to be the successor to PlugX. The project name of
a ShadowPad controller was “SC(1.1)” – embedded in the PDB string – while
a project name of the PlugX controller was “SController (SC)” by its developer.

A report by AT&T assessed that the developer of PlugX was likely to be a known hacker, nicknamed
“whg” - aka “无花果”, based in China 3. whg was an established programmer with a solid track
record of developing backdoors and hacking tools, often selling “shared software” to others (as
Fig 1 shows). whg is based in the Sichuan province of China, sharing deep connections with the
actors behind what was previously known as ‘Winnti’ and evolved partly into APT41, one of the
active ShadowPad users. Winnti was known to carry out several attacks with PlugX 4,5. We discuss
this further below.

Fig 1: The introduction on wgh’s personal website. He stated that he had several years of
experience in software development, and he also sold some “shared software” on this website.

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
ShadowPad is a modular backdoor - each plugin contains specific functionality that can be ‘plugged’
or ‘unplugged’ during runtime - in shellcode format. It also allows dynamic loading of additional
plugins which are not initially embedded in the sample from the C&C server.
In this section, we discuss the emergence of ShadowPad, describe some technical details of the
backdoor, and give our assessment on how it is sold.

Modular Design
ShadowPad is a modular backdoor in shellcode format. On execution, a layer of an obfuscated shellcode
loader is responsible for decrypting and loading a Root plugin. While the sequence of operation in the
Root plugin decrypts, it loads other plugins embedded in the shellcode into memory. The plugins are
kept and referenced through a linked list:

struct plugin_node {
plugin_node* previous_node;
plugin_node* next_node;
DWORD referenced_count;
DWORD plugin_timestamp;
DWORD plugin_id;
DWORD field_0;
DWORD field_1;
DWORD field_2;
DWORD field_3;
DWORD plugin_size;
LPVOID plugin_base_addr;
LPVOID plugin_export_function_table_addr;
}

Along with the plugins embedded in the sample, additional plugins are allowed to be remotely
uploaded from the C&C server, which allows users to dynamically add functionalities not included
by default. The uploaded plugins will be kept in memory and added to the linked list of the plugin
nodes, as shown in Fig 2.

SentinelOne has collected 22 unique plugins from SentinelOne’s internal sample set. These are
listed fully in Appendix A.
Controller
As luck would have it, the ShadowPad controller (version 1.0, 2015) was accidentally discovered
during private research. All of the stakeholders involved agreed to our releasing screenshots
but not the details of the actual file, so we are unable to provide hashes for this component
at present. Analysis of the controller allowed us to obtain a clear picture of how the builder
generates the shellcodes, how the users manage the infected hosts, and the kinds of functions
available on the controller.
Written in Delphi, it has the capability to both generate malware and control backdoor
communications. The controller provides an interface to manage infected hosts, manage C&C
server listeners and build new ShadowPad shellcode pieces (as shown in Fig 3). This is a relatively
unique characteristic of malware used by Chinese espionage threat actors.

Fig 3: The main page of the controller
• Users: The list of infected hosts.
• Transfer: The transferring progress of files which are currently being transferred from and
to the infected hosts.
• Listen: To control the C&C listeners and the protocols in use.
• Setting: Intended to be a setting panel, but there is no option on the list in this version.
• Builder: The ShadowPad shellcode builder.

The user can choose to enter the management console of a single infected computer (shown in
Fig 4). The console allows the user to manage the plugin list and use the functions of each plugin.
The plugins “Root” to “Http” are embedded in the samples by default. If the user wants to use the
functions of other plugins, those plugins need to be uploaded to the infected computer (in Fig 5).

The builder (in Fig 6) allows the user to modify the campaign code and notes, anti-debugger
settings, installation settings (service and register), process injection settings, C&C servers and
connection modes. It also contains configuration import and export functionalities.

PRIVATELY SHARED ATTACK FRAMEWORK OR PRIVATELY
SOLD MODULAR MALWARE?
An intriguing question to address is whether ShadowPad is a privately shared attack framework
or a privately developed modular malware platform for sale to specific groups. Its design allows
the users to remotely deploy new plugins to a backdoor. In theory, anyone capable of producing a
plugin that is encrypted and compressed in the correct format can add new functionalities to the
backdoor freely. However, the control interfaces of the plugins are hardcoded in the “Manager ”
page of the ShadowPad controller (in Fig 7), and the controller itself does not include a feature
to add a new control interface. In other words, it is unlikely that ShadowPad was created as a
collaborative attacking framework. Only the plugins produced by the original developer could be
included and used through the ShadowPad controller.

Fig 7: The interfaces to control the plugins are hardcoded and listed in the “Manager ” page.
The users can interact with the plugins only through the listed interface

SHA DOWPAD: A MAST E RP IE C E OF P RIVAT E LY S OL D MALWARE IN C H I NE S E E S PI O N AG E

10

On the other hand, even if the control interface of a plugin is listed in
the menu, not every available plugin is embedded in the ShadowPad
samples built by the controller by default. Once a plugin is not included
in the compiled sample, the user needs to upload the corresponding
plugin (encrypted and compressed in the correct format) and place
it in the “Plugins” directory in the package during runtime on the
client side. There is no configuration in the builder to allow the user
to choose which plugins are compiled into the generated sample, so
this setting can only be managed by the developer of the controller.
Any functionality can be easily removed from the bundle by removing
the corresponding plugin from the directory.
If ShadowPad was not originally designed as an open framework,
the following question is whether it is freely shared with or sold to
its users. The possible author ‘whg’ – and one of his close affiliates,
Rose, who will be introduced in the following section – have been
monetizing their malware development and hacking skills since the
early 2000s. Both individuals sold self-developed malware, and Rose
offered services such as software cracking, penetration testing and
DDoS attacks 6. If ShadowPad was developed by them or their close
affiliates, it is more likely to be sold to – rather than freely shared
with – other users under this context.
Selling the Plugins Separately Rather
than Giving a Full Bundle by Default
As discussed, the available functionalities to ShadowPad users
are highly controlled by the seller of ShadowPad. Looking deeply
into the plugin numbers and the distribution of different plugins
embedded in around a hundred samples, we assessed that the
seller is likely selling each plugin separately instead of offering
a full bundle with all of the currently available plugins. In other
words, a buyer needs to pick how many plugins they need and
acquire them from the seller. The seller does not provide all the
functionality or capabilities by default.

The number of plugins embedded in the samples

Fig 8: The number of samples grouped by the number of plugins in each sample
Fig 8 groups the samples by the number of the plugins embedded in them. As the figure shows,
most of the samples contain less than nine plugins with the following plugins embedded: Root,
Plugins, Config, Install, Online, TCP, HTTP, UDP and DNS. This set of plugins can only support
the installation of backdoors and communications with C&C servers, without providing further
functionality. Actors owning samples with more than 16 plugins, which are all packed by the same
loader and are likely to be used by a single closed group, are likely to be offered as ‘fully packaged’
versions of ShadowPad with the specially configured builders that can build samples with a full set
of plugins. In other cases, the actors can only compile ShadowPad backdoors with the basic set
of plugins. They need to manually upload other plugins if they want to use other functionalities.
During our research, we found Tick - one of the threat groups with access to ShadowPad - developed
a tool to extract the list of installed software information on an infected host while a plugin of
ShadowPad with the same functionality – the plugin “Software” – was discovered in a sample used
by another threat group in a similar time frame. This shows that not every customer of ShadowPad
decides to (or is able to) obtain all of the available plugins. We assess that the plugins are likely
to be provided separately.

WHAT THREAT ACTORS ARE USING SHADOWPAD?
Despite being the potential successor to PlugX, ShadowPad is sold
privately to a limited set of customers. SentinelOne has identified at
least 5 activity clusters of ShadowPad users since 2017.
APT41
APT41 is the accepted naming convention for the activities conducted
by two spinoffs of what was once referred to as ‘Winnti’, sub-groups –
BARIUM (Tan Dailin aka Rose and Zhang Haoran) and LEAD (Chengdu
404 Network Technology Co., Ltd) 7. All of the individuals are based
in Chengdu, Sichuan. Rose, Zhang Haoran, and Jiang Lizhi (AKA
“BlackFox”, one of the responsible persons of Chengdu 404) were
coworkers between 2011 and 2017, while Rose and BlackFox already
knew each other since at least 2006 8.
One of the actors, Rose - AKA “凋凌玫瑰” - started his active collaboration
on malware development with whg, the author of PlugX, when he was
a member of the hacking group NCPH back in 2005 9. They developed
“NCPH Remote Control Software” (as shown in Fig 9) together until
2007. The executable of the controller was freely shared on NCPH
websites 10,11, but they also declared that the source code was for sale
(see Fig 10). Aside from this, NCPH offered customized services of
software cracking, malware development and penetration testing 12.
Both Rose and whg were monetizing their malware development skills
back in the day.

BARIUM (Rose and Zhang Haoran) were one of the earliest threat
groups with access to ShadowPad. Aside from some smaller-scale
attacks against the gaming industr y 13, they were accountable for
several supply chain attacks from 2017 to 2018, some of their
victims included NetSarang 14, ASUS 15, and allegedly, CCleaner 16,17.
In the aforementioned incidents, the actors used ShadowPad as
the primar y backdoor of the intrusion after the initial infection
phases. During the supply chain attack against ASUS, the samples of
ShadowPad were highly customized compared to other ShadowPad
samples SentinelOne analyzed. Ever y layer of shellcode and
plugin was packed with VMProtect, and the plugins had different
plugin numbers. Another subgroup, LEAD, also used ShadowPad
along with other backdoors to attack victims for both financial
and espionage purposes. They were reported to attack electronic
providers and consumers, universities, telecommunication, NGO
and foreign governments.
Considering the long-term affiliation relationship between Rose and
whg, we suspect that Rose likely had high privilege access to – or
was a co-developer of – ShadowPad, and other close affiliates in
Chengdu were likely sharing resources. This could also explain why
BARIUM was able to utilize a special version of ShadowPad in some
of their attacks.

TICK AND TONTO TEAM
Tick and Tonto Team (referred to as Tick in the following report)
have been active users of ShadowPad since 2018. These two groups
amalgamated into a new institution during the reorganization of the
PLA, and soon thereafter SentinelOne identified significant resource
sharing between them, such as the overlaps of C&C infrastructure
and the utilities of similar toolsets. A noticeable change after the
merge was that they started to use ShadowPad as their primary
backdoor for conducting intrusion activities. In the past, they were
known to develop their own backdoors for their operations.

The threat group conducted several operations with ShadowPad as the primary backdoor from
2018 onwards. Internally, they called ShadowPad “Casper ”, according to the PDB strings extracted
from the customized loaders. Throughout 2019, Tick crafted and sent spear phishing emails to
deliver ShadowPad in victims’ networks for information exfiltration and long-term espionage 18. In
2020, they exploited CVE-2019-9489 19 and CVE-2020-8468 20 in Trend Micro’s security solutions
that were exposed to the Internet, in order to deliver ShadowPad into internal networks for further
exploitation 21. Based on the sample sets we collected, Tick used at least five different versions of
ShadowPad; however, all of the samples only contained the basic set of plugins.
Although they turned from self-developed backdoors to the acquired or leaked backdoors, they
still developed some customized tools for intrusion, such as a modified mimikatz, a screen capture
tool, a packet transmission tool, a tool to list the software installed on a computer, and a VBScript
command execution tool. For instance, SentinelOne uncovered a VBScript command execution
tool builder (as Fig 11 shows) which can generate a payload of VBScript with built-in evasion
techniques to bypass TrendMicro products. The self-developed tool to list the software strongly
suggests that Tick was unable to obtain all of the available plugins, since a plugin with the same
functionality was available at that time.

hacking tools in Tick’s arsenal.

OPERATION REDBONUS
SentinelOne caught a ShadowPad activity cluster that had no clear link to known threat groups.
SentinelOne tracks the activities of this cluster under the moniker ‘Operation Redbonus’.
The first activity of ShadowPad SentinelOne discovered occurred at the end of 2019. All the
samples we collected from Operation Redbonus were running the same version of ShadowPad.
During our investigations, we also spotted other backdoors in use, such as Whitebird 22, IceFog and
a customized instance of PCShare. The actors behind this cluster appear to show interest in Indian
targets with several DDNS domains spoofing some Indian institutions.

OPERATION REDKANKU
There is another small set of ShadowPad samples without clear attributions in the public
domain. All of the C&C servers extracted from the samples had a self-signed certificate
b41948daacd4c081a58a14aa51c37af21738447b installed. Whilst further attribution or overlaps
are not available at the time of writing, some related samples were documented to be a part of the
ProxyLogon attacks according to a report by ESET 23.

FISHMONGER
Another activity cluster – tracked by SentinelOne as Fishmonger – has
been active since at least 2018. The cluster is tracked based on the
overlap of infrastructure and indicators, as well as some behavioral
connections between different campaigns.
Back in 2019, the actors used a special version of ShadowPad which
allowed them to generate samples with a handful of plugins embedded
by default 24. In 2020, they gained access to a new version of ShadowPad
which had updates and more advanced obfuscation techniques. They
are now using it and another backdoor called Spyder 25 as their primary
backdoors for long-term monitoring 26, while they distribute other
first-stage backdoors for initial infections including FunnySwitch,
BIOPASS RAT 27, and Cobalt Strike. The victims include universities,
governments, media sector companies, technology companies and
health organizations conducting COVID-19 research in Hong Kong,
Taiwan, India and the US.

ASSESSMENT
Apart from the threat groups and activity clusters detailed above, there are still some unattributed
ShadowPad samples in the sample set SentinelOne collected and analyzed. The nature of privately
sold backdoors requires more context to begin analytically-sound attribution. There might be other
unidentified actors using this backdoor, and it requires a rigorous approach when attempting to
attribute ShadowPad campaigns.
Since ShadowPad is a powerful backdoor with a complete set of functionalities, a number of
its users (for instance, Tick and Fishmonger) deploy ShadowPad for the purpose of long-term
espionage in victim environments. Threat actors using ShadowPad select systems with high
privileges on networks to reduce the probability of detection, such as AD servers or domain
controllers. Proactive scanning and periodical health checks on high-privilege hosts are essential
to discover the footprints of attackers.

LANDSCAPE SHIFT: FROM DEVELOPING BACKDOORS
TO ACQUIRING BACKDOORS
It is not a secret that a number of Chinese threat actors develop their own tool sets based on their
needs during operations. However, established espionage threat actors also acquire tooling to add
to their arsenals. Tick was one of the most active users of ShadowPad according to research. Prior
to this, Tick was documented to be using self-developed backdoors including Darsef, xxmm and
Datper 30. A noticeable change SentinelOne discovered during the monitoring of the threat group
was that the actors later stopped the use of other self-developed backdoors after actively using
ShadowPad (which they called Casper).

This example of the shift from ‘home-brewed’ backdoors to acquired malware marks a noticeable
change influenced by the privately sold malware platform ShadowPad. Acquiring a well-designed
piece of malware significantly reduces the cost of operation and human resource needed to develop
the malware in-house. The service provider also keeps enhancing the stability and usability of the
backdoor with new features added, unlike much of the commodity malware found in cybercriminal
circles or underground forums. Furthermore, the usage of shared malware provides espionage
threat actors a layer of security in that it makes attribution much more difficult for defenders. The
popularity of malware such as ShadowPad and Cobalt Strike among Chinese espionage groups
makes campaign identification significantly harder.

CONCLUSION
The emergence of ShadowPad, a privately sold, well-developed and functional backdoor, offers
threat actors a good opportunity to move away from self-developed backdoors. While it is welldesigned – highly likely to be produced by an experienced malware developer – it is also under
active maintenance on both its functionalities and its anti-forensics capabilities. For these threat
actors, using ShadowPad as the primary backdoor significantly reduces the costs of development.
They do not need to spend time developing new functionalities, adding new obfuscations to their
samples or conducting testing on their backdoors before deployment. Besides, the nature of the
“sold backdoor ” reduces the chances of the actors being identified solely by the tool, allowing the
actors to remain hidden and unidentified for longer.
For security researchers and analysts tracking China-based threat actors, the adoption of the “sold
- or cracked - commercial backdoor ” raises difficulties in ascertaining which threat actor they are
investigating. More systematic ways – for instance, analysis on the relationship between indicators,
long-term monitoring on the activities and campaigns – need to be developed in order to carry out
analytically-sound attribution. Any claim made publicly on the attribution of ShadowPad users
requires careful validation and strong evidentiary support so that it can help the community’s
effort in identifying Chinese espionage.
