Executive Summary
The BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team recently uncovered a campaign by an advanced persistent threat (APT) group called Mustang
Panda that is leveraging the PlugX malware family to target the Southeast Asian state of Myanmar.
Our team analyzed the samples in question and found their embedded configurations revealed a set of command-and-control (C2) domains
that masquerade as Myanmar news outlets. This is not the first time a campaign targeting this state has impersonated Myanmar news outlets
or used PlugX malware.
These tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), along with other corroborating evidence – such as a previous indication that the group was
active in this location – lead us to assert with reasonable confidence that the China-based threat group known as Mustang Panda is
responsible for this campaign

Mustang Panda: an Origin Story
Mustang Panda (aka HoneyMyte, Bronze President or Red Delta) is a prolific APT group that has been publicly attributed as being based in
China. This group conducted malware campaigns as far back as 2012, which primarily related to cyber-espionage.
Their targets have included Government and Non-Government Organizations (NGO) in many locations around the world, from various states
in Southeast Asia to the European Union to the U.S. and beyond.

Mustang Panda Attack Vector
Mustang Panda typically sends phishing emails with malicious document attachments as an initial infection vector. These documents are
usually designed to mimic those of the targeted country or organization, or even current world affairs applicable to that region.
Once threat actors gain a foothold within a target organization, they typically deploy one of a variety of payloads such as Cobalt Strike, Poison
Ivy, or PlugX, the latter of which is used most extensively.

Initial Thread
In late May of this year, BlackBerry detected some unusual network traffic to a domain – www[.]myanmarnewsonline[.]org. At first glance, this
URL appeared to be a Myanmar news website.
The files found to be communicating with this site were encompassed in several .RAR files. These files had a relatively low detection ratio on
VirusTotal (VT), and as shown in Figure 2, they followed a naming convention designed to make them appear to be legitimate utilities relating
to Hewlett-Packard (HP) printers.

Figure 2 – Communicating RAR files
The RAR archives contained a legitimate signed utility from HP, along with a DLL loader and a DAT file that is an encrypted PlugX payload.
One of the legitimate utilities (“HPCustParticUI.exe” – SHA256 8857232077b4b0f0e4a2c3bb5717fd65079209784f41694f8e1b469e34754cf6)
was previously used in a similar fashion as part of a PlugX execution chain, which was documented by another vendor in September 2021.
In early June of this year, a tweet from the user @kienbigmummy (shown in Figure 3) mentioned an additional .RAR file titled “service
Log.rar” that was linked with a sub-domain of the previously mentioned website – images[.]myanmarnewsonline[.]org – that was associated
with PlugX and the Mustang Panda APT group.

We examined the network infrastructure (shown in Figure 4) linked to each of these three RAR files, which provided evidence of additional
samples that conform to the same or similar TTPs going back as far as late 2020, along with other sample types such as Cobalt Strike
beacon.

What is PlugX?
PlugX is a remote access tool (RAT) used by several threat groups. It is the malware of choice for the Chinese APT group Mustang Panda.
This group delivers the PlugX implant in the form of an encrypted data blob, which is typically paired with a DLL loader as well as a benign
application.

This actor has commonly employed the stealthy technique of side-loading the malicious DLLs into legitimate applications during execution.
This action then deploys the PlugX implant into memory.
We noted threat actors had used three separate legitimate applications within our RAR files; A free VPN service, and two legitimate HP
applications related to HP’s Digital Imaging. Each legitimate application was bundled with a DLL and a data file. In two out of the three RAR
files, the DAT file masqueraded as a different file format, such as JSON or CHM.
Upon execution of the legitimate application, the threat loads a malicious DLL loader in a specific set order, which the threat actor has
strategically placed in the same folder to replace a legitimate one. This proceeds to side-load the DLL by abusing the DLL search order, which
is a technique also known as DLL Search Order Hijacking. The malicious DLL is then loaded into the legitimate application, where it decrypts,
loads and deploys the malicious PlugX implant. This execution chain is shown in Figure 5.

Technical Analysis
The DLL loader is heavily obfuscated and employs dynamic API resolution upon runtime. It retrieves a handle to the encrypted PlugX implant,
then reads the data into a newly allocated region within memory. Execution is then passed to the implant, where the shellcode is executed,
and it XOR decrypts the embedded payload, as shown in Figure 6. Once decryption is complete, RtlDecompressBuffer is called to
decompress the decrypted payload to its final form as shown in Figure 7.

Conclusion
Mustang Panda, which is publicly known as a Chinese-affiliated APT group, has an established history of using the PlugX malware and
targeting nations throughout South-East Asia. This threat actor has been previously linked to campaigns targeting Myanmar government
entities using custom lures and compromising the website of the office of Myanmar’s president.
The TTPs associated with the campaign covered in this report align with those of Mustang Panda. We observed a typical attack chain
employed by the group, where attackers used a benign executable to side-load a malicious DLL loader, which then decrypts and loads the
PlugX implant. We have also confirmed the C2 infrastructure associated with this campaign has been used to target entities in Myanmar,
including a government VPN portal, from early March onwards.
