Vitali presents malware techniques and tricks on how to reverse engineer and analyze
malware families exploiting active directory. The talk dives deeper into pseudo-source code
level analysis and malware developer implementation of Lightweight Directory Access
Protocol (LDAP) harvesting techniques for lateral movement and persistence across
corporate environment. The talks explores three prolific malware families such as TrickBot,
QakBot, and IcedID (BokBot) and their coding routine and patterns that are focused on
collecting LDAP. For example, TrickBot specifically grabs credential and group policy
information stored in “SYSVOL” das well as searching for corporate machines for possible
sensitive machines associated with possible point-of-sale terminals on domain controller.
Vitali also presents detection and mitigation methods on how to detect active directory
exploitation and discusses defense mechanisms surrounding most popular active methods
used in the wild by the sophisticated groups.

3. 3. Cybercrime Enterprise Deal with Big Data • Sophisticated criminal enterprises such
as TrickBot & QakBot - focused on parsing and identifying high-value targets (HVT) •
Need reliable install loaders - intermittently rely on Emotet Loader for installs • Big
botnet data collectors necessitate scalable solutions to identify high-value targets
(corporate networks with local domains) versus “useless” infections • Simple idea:
Squeeze as £ / € / $ value from your bots as possible • Banking Malware • Credential
Stealer • Miner • Ransomware! Reference: “Charting the Next Cybercrime Frontier, or

12. 12. • "domainDll32," compiled via 'GCC: (Rev1, Built by MSYS2 project) 7.2.0,' allows
TrickBot operators to collect domain controller information once they are already on the
compromised machine. • This module is internally called "DomainGrabber" and accepts
command "getdata" in order to start harvest domain information. • domainDll appears
to be aimed at exploiting networks with unsecured domain controllers. domainDll

15. 15. Active Directory Enumeration Methodologies • “networkDll” module is a single
harvester of all possible network victim information from running commands such as
"ipconfig /all" and "nltest /domain_trusts /all_trusts" to WMI Query Language (WQL)
queries such as "SELECT * FROM Win32_OperatingSystem" to lightweight directory
access protocol (LDAP) queries. • Notably, the group leverages "nltest" commands to
establish trust relationship between between a compromised workstation and its
possible domain before querying LDAP. networkDll (32|64) Reference:

18. 18. • “psfin32” is a point-of-sale finder reconnaissance module hunts for point of sale
related services, software, and machines in Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(LDAP) • The module itself does not steal any point-of-sale data but rather used to
profile corporate machines of interest with possible point-of-sale devices. • This module
arrived just in time for the holiday shopping season highlighting the group interest in
exploring possible point-of-sale breaches. psfinDll (32|64) Reference:

24. 24. Life Cycle of High-Profile Event: “No system is safe”
25. 25. Detections & Mitigations • Identify who has AD admin rights (domain/forest) •
Identify who can logon to Domain Controllers (& admin rights to virtual environment
hosting virtual DCs) • XML Permissions • Place a new xml file in SYSVOL & set
Everyone:Deny • Audit Access Denied errors. • Scan Active Directory Domains, OUs,
AdminSDHolder, & GPOs for inappropriate custom permissions Credit: Rahmat

26. 26. Key Takeaways & Outlook • Automated Malware + Interactive Human Exploitation
Operator -> New Cybercrime Frontier • Active Directory & Network Enumeration are the
key to identify high-value corporate and multi-tenancy targets for additional
monetization (e.g., Ryuk ransomware) • Cloud MSP are the desired targets as they are
gateways to their customer environments (e.g., CloudJumper) Credit: CloudJumper
