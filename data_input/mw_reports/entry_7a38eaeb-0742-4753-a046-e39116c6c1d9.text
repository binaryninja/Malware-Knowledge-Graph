Back in February we wrote about a new ransomware called Thanatos that was encrypting
victim's data, but contained flaws that would not allow the authors to decrypt a victims files
even if they paid. Thankfully, the Cisco Talos Group was able to find a method to break the
encryption routine in order to create a decryptor that allows victims to recover their files for
free.
While Thanatos never had a wide distribution, there were some victims of this
ransomware as indicated by submissions to ID Ransomware and from Cisco's
analysis. According to Cisco there were multiple campaigns, with version 1.1 being
distributed most widely.
This version used a more advanced ransom note and visibly showed the name and version of
the ransomware as displayed below. Victim's of this ransomware would also have their files
encrypted and the names of the file's would have the .THANATOS extension appended to
them. For example, test.jpg would be encrypted and named as test.jpg.THANATOS.

Thanatos Ransom Note

Cisco has also stated that other versions were released that did not contain any contact
information and appeared to be designed to simply destroy the victim's data.
"In investigating the distribution mechanisms being used by the attacker to infect victims
and remove their ability to access data on their system, we identified an interesting campaign
that indicated that at least in this particular case, the attacker had no intention of providing
any sort of data decryption to the victim," Cisco's report stated. "The malware appears to
have been delivered to the victim as an attachment to a chat message sent to the victim using
the Discord chat platform."
As Thanatos was released at one time as an open-source project, it is possible that other
developers were creating their own versions using same ransomware code base.

Decrypting files encrypted by the Thanatos Ransomware

To decrypt files encrypted by the Thanatos Ransomware, you should download the Thanatos
Decryptor and save it to your desktop. You also need to make sure you have the Microsoft
Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2017 installed or you will receive errors about
missing DLLs when you try to run the decryptor.

Thanatos Decryptor

Once you have everything you need, simply double-click on the executable and the decryptor
will begin to search for files to decrypt. At this time, the decryptor will only decrypt the
following file types:
Image: .gif, .tif, .tiff, .jpg, .jpeg, .png
Video: .mpg, .mpeg, .mp4, .avi
Audio: .wav
Document: .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, .pptx, .pdf, .odt, .ods, .odp, .rtf
Other: .zip, .7z, .vmdk, .psd, .lnk
Cisco also recommends that the decryptor be run on the same machine that the files were
encrypted. The decryption process can take quite a while, so please be patient while it
decrypts your files.
For those who are interested in learning how decryptors work, Cisco has open sourced their
tool, which be found at the project's Github page.
