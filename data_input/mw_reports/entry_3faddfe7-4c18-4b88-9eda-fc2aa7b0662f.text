The Kraken Cryptor Ransomware is a newer ransomware that was released in August 2018. A
new version, called Kraken Cryptor 1.5, was recently released that is masquerading as the
legitimate SuperAntiSpyware anti-malware program in order to trick users into installing it.
What makes it worse, though, is that somehow the attackers were able to gain access to the
superantispyware.com site and distribute the ransomware from there.

SuperAntiSpyware
MalwareHunterTeam, who has been tracking Kraken Cryptor since it has been released,
discovered the new variant this morning. When looking at its entry on VirusTotal, he noticed
that VirusTotal was reporting that the Kraken Cryptor installer had been distributed directly
from superantispyware.com.

The file name for the legitimate SuperAntiSpyware Free installer is called
SUPERAntiSpyware.exe. The Kraken Cryptor installer spotted by VirusTotal was
called SUPERAntiSpywares.exe. The only difference between the two names is the addition
of a s to the malicious executable. This malicious executable is no longer available from
superantispyware.com.
You can further see how Kraken Cryptor is trying to masquerade as SuperAntiSpyware by
utilizing the same icon as shown below.

It is important to note that the SUPERAntiSpyware.exe executable was not compromised and
continued to install the legitimate version of SuperAntiSpyware. So users who installed
SuperAntiSpyware via the normal links were not affected.
At this point, we do not know how users were being directed to the malicious
SUPERAntiSpywares.exe executable. Bleeping Computer has made numerous attempts to
contact SuperAntiSpyware via email, phone, and Twitter for comment, but have not received
a response at the time of publication.

How the Kraken Cryptor Ransomware encrypts a computer
The Kraken Cryptor Ransomware provides good insight into how it encrypts a computer due
to an embedded configuration file that is easily exported. This configuration file contains a
list of modules and if they are enabled, processes to stop, the public encryption key, emails,
ransom prices, extensions to encrypt, files and folders to to be skipped, countries and
languages that won't be encrypted, and more.
You can see a portion of this configuration file below.

When executed, the ransomware will perform a series of steps that are listed below, but may
not be in the exact order in which they are executed.
The ransomware will create a file called C:\ProgramData\Safe.exe and execute it. This
program will then enumerate a list of all the Event Viewer logs and redirect the output to the
C:\ProgramData\EventLog.txt file.
C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /c wevtutil.exe enum-logs > "C:\ProgramData\EventLog.txt"

The program will then remove all the logs listed in the Eventlog.txt.

Kraken Cryptor will also check the language and location of the victim, and if in the following
countries, will not encrypt the computer.
Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Iran, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan,
Lithuania, Latvia, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan,
and Brazil

In order to prevent processes keeping databases open and unable to be encrypted, the
ransomware will terminate the processes listed below.
agntsvcagntsvc, agntsvcencsvc, agntsvcisqlplussvc, dbeng50, dbsnmp, firefoxconfig,
msftesql, mydesktopqos, mydesktopservice, mysqld, mysqld-nt, mysqld-opt, ocomm,
ocssd, oracle, sqbcoreservice, sqlagent, sqlbrowser, sqlservr, sqlwriter, sqlwb,
synctime, tbirdconfig, and xfssvccon

When encrypting a computer, it will scan the computer for files with the following

If it encounters a matching file, it will encrypt the file and rename it in the format
00000000-Lock.onion, where the numbers will increment for each encrypted file. The
original file name will be encrypted and stored in the encrypted file.

When encrypting the computer, Kraken Cryptor will create a ransom notes named # How to
Decrypt Files.html in every folder. This ransom note contains a unique victim key and
instructions on how to make a 0.125 bitcoin ransom payment. The contact information
provided in the ransom note is shortmangnet@420blaze.it and BM2cUEkUQXNffBg89VwtZi4twYiMomAFzy6o@bitmessage.ch.

The ransomware will also download SDelete from the Sysinternals site and execute a batch
file called release.bat. This batch file will cause SDelete to clear and overwrite all free space
on the drive with zeros to make it harder to recover files. It will also cause the computer to
shutdown, disable Windows startup recovery, delete Windows backups, and delete shadow
volume copies.

This is all done to make it harder for victims to recover their files.

It is not possible to decrypt the Kraken Cryptor Ransomware
Unfortunately, at this time there is no way to decrypt files encrypted by the Kraken Cryptor
Ransomware variant for free.
The only way to recover encrypted files is via a backup, or if you are incredibly lucky, through
Shadow Volume Copies. Though Kraken Cryptor does attempt to remove Shadow Volume
Copies, in rare cases ransomware infections fail to do so for whatever reason. Due to this, if
you do not have a viable backup, I always suggest people try as a last resort to restore
encrypted files from Shadow Volume Copies as well.

Kraken Cryptor Ransomware Help & Support Topic.

How to protect yourself from the Kraken Cryptor Ransomware
In order to protect yourself from Kraken Cryptor, or from any ransomware, it is important
that you use good computing habits and security software. First and foremost, you should
always have a reliable and tested backup of your data that can be restored in the case of an
7/10

emergency, such as a ransomware attack.
As ransomware is also known to be installed via hacked Remote Desktop services, it is very
important to make sure its locked down correctly. This includes making sure that no
computers running remote desktop services are connected directly to the Internet. Instead
place computers running remote desktop behind VPNs so that they are only accessible to
those who have VPN accounts on your network.
It is also important to setup proper account lockout policies so that it makes it difficult for
accounts to be brute forced over Remote Desktop Services.
You should also have security software that incorporates behavioral detections to combat
ransomware and not just signature detections or heuristics. For example, Emsisoft AntiMalware and Malwarebytes Anti-Malware both contain behavioral detection that can prevent
many, if not most, ransomware infections from encrypting a computer.
Last, but not least, make sure you practice the following good online security habits, which in
many cases are the most important steps of all:
Backup, Backup, Backup!
Do not open attachments if you do not know who sent them.
Do not open attachments until you confirm that the person actually sent you them,
Scan attachments with tools like VirusTotal.
Make sure all Windows updates are installed as soon as they come out! Also make sure
you update all programs, especially Java, Flash, and Adobe Reader. Older programs
contain security vulnerabilities that are commonly exploited by malware distributors.
Therefore it is important to keep them updated.
Make sure you use have some sort of security software installed.
Use hard passwords and never reuse the same password at multiple sites.
If you are using Remote Desktop Services, do not connect it directly to the Internet.
Instead make it accessibly only via a VPN.

9/14/18: Updated story to call it Kraken Cryptor rather than just Kraken.
9/14/18: We received the following statement from SuperAntiSpyware:
"A malicious file was uploaded to the SUPERAntiSpyware download server as a result of an
attempted attack on the server," SuperAntiSpyware told BleepingComputer. "The malicious
file was discovered and removed from the server within several hours of the attempt. The
server has since been thoroughly scanned and the vulnerability has been corrected."
