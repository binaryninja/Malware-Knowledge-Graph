Update on December 30, 2021 at 11:35AM PT:
Today, we filed another legal action against a group in Vietnam responsible for account
takeover attacks. The defendants targeted the accounts of employees of marketing
companies and tricked the victims into self-compromising their accounts by installing
malicious software that was deceptively promoted as Facebook-affiliated tools for managing
ads. Once installed, the malicious software was programmed to collect information through a
technique known as “session or cookie hijacking.” The defendants then used the accounts to
run ads without the victims’ knowledge or consent. Facebook has reimbursed the victims for
the unauthorized ads, which resulted in over $16 million in losses, and helped them secure
their accounts. The malicious software has also been removed from online sources.

As part of our ongoing efforts to keep people safe and combat abuse of our ad platform, we
filed two separate legal actions today against the perpetrators of online scams who violated
our Terms and Advertising Policies.

1/2

In the first case, the defendants are a California marketing company and its agents
responsible for a bait-and-switch advertising scheme on Facebook. In the second case, the
defendants are a group of individuals located in Vietnam who got users to self-compromise
their Facebook accounts and ran millions of dollars of unauthorized ads.

Combating Ad Scams
Our first lawsuit is against N&J USA Incorporated, Mohit Melwani, and Vishaal Melwani, who
ran deceptive ads on Facebook that promoted the sale of merchandise such as clothing,
watches and toys. When someone clicked on one of these ads, they were redirected to thirdparty e-commerce websites to complete their purchase. After paying for an item, users either
never received anything or received merchandise that was different or of a lesser quality
than what had been advertised.
In an effort to conceal their bait-and-switch scheme on Facebook, the defendants blocked
and concealed user complaints and negative reviews on their Facebook Pages. Facebook
previously disabled several of the defendants’ accounts and Pages. This action is one of
Facebook’s first lawsuits against this type of bait-and-switch scheme and builds on our prior
actions against e-commerce abuse.

Disrupting Account Takeover Attacks
The second suit is against four individuals residing in Vietnam, who used a technique known
as “session theft” or “cookie theft” to compromise accounts of employees of advertising and
marketing agencies and then ran unauthorized ads. The defendants misled the victims into
self-compromising their accounts by installing a mobile app from the Google Play Store
deceptively called “Ad Manager for Facebook.” This app, which has since been removed
from the Play store, was created by the defendants and prompted users to share their
Facebook login credentials and other information, which was then used to access their
Facebook accounts and run ads. In some cases, these ads also promoted online scams. The
group ran over $36 million in unauthorized ads. In this case, Facebook refunded the victims
and helped them secure their accounts.
The suit seeks to expose the full conduct of Thêm Hữu Nguyễn, Lê Khang, Nguyễn Quốc
Bảo and Pham Hữu Dung’s and hold them accountable for creating the app, tricking people
into installing it, compromising people’s Facebook accounts and then using those accounts
to run deceptive ads. This is our second lawsuit against an account takeover attack.
Today’s legal actions demonstrate our ongoing commitment to protecting users, enforcing
our policies and holding people accountable for abusing our services.
