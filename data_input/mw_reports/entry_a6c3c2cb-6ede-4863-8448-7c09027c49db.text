What makes organizations in the public sector vulnerable to ransomware?
By Dr. Robert Ames, Staff Threat Researcher

Executive Summary
SecurityScorecard’s threat research team undertook a broad survey of recent
developments in ransomware activity affecting the state and local government and
education (SLED) sectors.
The ALPHV/BlackCat and LockBit 2.0 ransomware groups appear to have been
responsible for a notable portion of activity targeting SLED organizations in 2022.
Ransomware groups have continued to modify their TTPs throughout 2022;
although their main points of entry (phishing, compromised remote access services,
and exploitation of known vulnerabilities) have remained broadly consistent, their
specific methods have evolved; SecurityScorecard observed ransomware groups
exploiting new Apache and Confluence vulnerabilities in Q2 2022 attacks.

Third-party risks have also persisted, with ransomware attacks against SLED
institutions’ vendors leading to client data breaches.
SecurityScorecard can support SLED organizations both before and after ransomware
attacks:
Our ratings platform and Attack Surface Intelligence (ASI) and Automated
Vendor Detection (AVD) products can enable continuous monitoring of their and
their vendor’s digital assets
Our Cyber Risk Intelligence as a Service (CRIaaS) offering can provide tailored
insights about the threats facing them
In the event of a successful or attempted attack, SecurityScorecard’s professional
services unit can support incident response efforts.

Introduction
In Spring 2022, Lincoln College announced that it would permanently close on May 13 and
noted that a December 2021 ransomware attack had contributed to its closure.
Unfortunately, at the same time that Lincoln College was struggling in vain to remain open,
other SLED (state, local and educational) institutions were suffering new ransomware
attacks, despite years of consistent evidence of ransomware groups’ particularly heavy
targeting of those sectors. On March 30, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a
private industry notification (PIN) warning of the continued targeting of local governments by
ransomware operators, noting that local Government Facilities Sector (GFS) entities were
the second-most frequent victims to report ransomware incidents to the FBI in 2021. The
notification goes on to highlight four incidents that affected county governments and
identifies phishing, remote desktop protocol (RDP) compromise, and exploitation of
unpatched vulnerabilities as the three most common means by which threat actors initially
accessed victims’ systems. In another relevant PIN, the FBI noted in May 2022 that
members of illicit forums regularly sell educational institutions’ credentials. Exposed
credentials may in fact be both a cause and effect of some attacks. Not only do ransomware
groups often use previously exposed credentials to access victim networks but, as the PIN
notes, some attackers also use an intrusion that ultimately results in a ransomware
deployment to harvest credentials from victim organizations.
In a summary study of 2021 ransomware incidents, Sophos surveyed a group of 499
information technology professionals in the education sector. They found that 44% of
respondents’ organizations had experienced ransomware attacks that year. Of those attacks,
58% resulted in the successful encryption of data, and 35% of successful encryptions led to
ransom payments. Moreover, Sophos’ statistics suggest that educational institutions may be
less capable of detecting attacks than other targets. The percentage of attacks resulting in
2/17

encryption for targets in education (58%) was 4% higher than the overall average (54%.) In
comparison, the percentage of respondents reporting that attacks were stopped before
encryption was 2% lower in education than overall (37% vs. 39%) and the percentage that
paid ransoms was 3% higher (35% vs. 32%).
Sophos also surveyed local government personnel in its study, finding that local
governments were the organizations least capable of disrupting attacks prior to encryption:
69% of respondents from local governments that suffered attacks reported those attacks led
to the encryption of their organizations’ data. Moreover, local governments were among the
ransomware victims to pay ransoms most frequently: 43% of local government respondents
reported that their organizations had paid a ransom after an incident.
Meanwhile, Emsisoft’s retrospective report on 2021 ransomware incidents found that
ransomware attacks had affected 77 state and local governments and 1,043 schools that
year, leading to an estimated minimum of 36 data breaches in local government and 118 in
education. This may indicate decreased targeting of local government, as 2021’s 77 victim
organizations is considerably fewer than the 113 recorded in both 2019 and 2020. Emsisoft
additionally notes that smaller municipalities also made up a larger proportion of 2021
victims, in contrast to previous years, whose ransomware victims included large cities like
Atlanta and Baltimore.
Unlike local government, according to Emsisoft’s research, the number of victims in the
education sector did not decrease as notably in 2021. 2020 saw 84 attacks against 26
colleges or universities and 58 school districts (impacting 1,681 individual schools within
those districts). In 2021, 88 incidents occurred, and the number of higher-education victims
remained 26, while the number of school districts increased to 62. However, the number of
schools affected by attacks against those districts decreased to 1043. This suggests that
ransomware groups are targeting smaller educational organizations more often, just as they
appear to have begun targeting smaller municipalities.
While 2022 is not over yet (and full-year statistics are therefore not yet available), early
indications are that ransomware attacks against targets in both local government and
education will persist, if not increase. In early April, Recorded Future reported that 37
schools had suffered ransomware attacks in the first quarter of 2022 alone, compared to 127
in all of 2021. This included seven confirmed victims in higher education:
North Carolina A&T University
Ohlone College
Savannah State University
University of Detroit Mercy

3/17

Centralia College
Phillips Community College of the University of Arkansas
National University College (NUC University)

In response to a later attack, another expert reported at the end of April that ransomware had
affected 12 institutions of higher education up to that point in the year, with 10 of those
incidents involving data theft, additionally noting that 9 school districts comprised of 234
individual schools had suffered attacks up to that point in 2022. Like the estimates above,
these figures would suggest that more attacks on the education sector will occur in 2022
than 2021, were they to continue at the same rate. Unlike education, however, attacks
against local governments may be decreasing. According to one estimate, as of early June,
22 local governments had suffered attacks, but by the same point in 2021, 36 local
government attacks had occurred.
Particularly Active Groups: ALPHV/BlackCat and LockBit 2.0
Of the year’s publicly-disclosed ransomware attacks against higher education and local
government, the LockBit 2.0 and ALPHV/BlackCat groups have figured particularly
prominently. Of the above reports, ALPHV claimed responsibility for the attacks on North
Carolina A&T and Phillips Community College, while LockBit 2.0 claimed the University of
Detroit Mercy and NUC University attacks. ALPHV subsequently claimed additional attacks
on Florida International University and Regina Public Schools and LockBit 2.0 claimed an
attack against Mercyhurst University (though shortly after claiming the attack, LockBit
removed Mercyhurst’s entry from its leak site). Most recently, on June 3, 2022, the town of
Alexandria, Louisiana reported that it had suffered a breach resulting from an attack by
ALPHV. Commentators have noted that the group took a particularly aggressive stance
against media coverage in addition to making more predictable threats to leak data directed
at state officials.
ALPHV (also tracked as BlackCat) and LockBit 2.0 are both ransomware-as-a-service
(RaaS) operations that reportedly conduct double and, in some cases, triple extortion against
their victims: in addition to demanding a ransom to decrypt encrypted systems, they not only
threaten to publish stolen data on their leak sites, but also occasionally launch distributed
denial of service (DDoS) attacks against their victims to apply additional pressure by way of
additional disruptions to their operations and recovery efforts. Both groups also often employ
Cobalt Strike in the course of their attacks.
As its name suggests, LockBit 2.0 is a continuation of the earlier LockBit ransomware
operation, which first surfaced in 2019 (LockBit 2.0 appeared in Summer 2021). According to
an FBI advisory released in February 2022, LockBit 2.0’s affiliates have accessed target
4/17

systems by a variety of means, including remote access purchased through initial access
brokers, exploitation of vulnerabilities both novel and published, and through malicious
insiders. More recent analysis of the group found that LockBit 2.0’s operators have sought
affiliates who can help compromise target systems through phishing, remote services
including RDP and VPN, previously exposed credentials, and insider access.
ALPHV first appeared in early December 2021. Early analysis found the BlackCat strain of
ransomware to be particularly sophisticated and that it was the first professionally-deployed
ransomware to be written in Rust. Later, in April 2022, the FBI warned that as of March,
ALPHV/BlackCat had already compromised 60 organizations and noted that the operation
likely shared personnel with the BlackMatter and DarkSide groups. DarkSide achieved
considerable notoriety for its attack on Colonial Pipeline, which likely led the group to
rebrand, first as BlackMatter and later as BlackCat. That warning notes that attackers
normally exploit previously exposed credentials to access victim systems, subsequently
escalating privileges and moving laterally while disabling security systems to avoid detection.
As with many other ransomware operations, the group steals documents from victim systems
in order to conduct secondary extortion and uses Cobalt Strike after initially compromising
victim systems. More recent research has found that some BlackCat affiliates have exploited
a Microsoft Exchange vulnerability to initially access unpatched servers–although the
research does not explicitly name the Exchange vulnerability in question, it may be the
widespread ProxyLogon vulnerability that was first disclosed in early 2021, given that
researchers link to guidance about it in the newer report.
Ongoing Risks: Third-Party/Supply Chain Breaches
Third-party risk has been a recurring topic of concern within the cybersecurity community,
and third-party breaches have proven particularly relevant in discussions of the impact of
ransomware upon government and educational institutions. In addition to direct attacks
against them, ransomware attacks against other businesses have also led to breaches of
government and educational institutions’ data.
In July 2020, Blackbaud, a technology provider that caters to nonprofit organizations, notified
customers (including many K-12 schools, colleges, and universities) that a February
ransomware attack had also exposed their data, but that Blackbaud had paid the ransom,
partially in hopes of preventing the attackers’ publication of the stolen data.
The Accellion FTA compromise that became prominent in early 2021 is a particularly wideranging example of the intersection between supply-chain cyber risk and ransomware.
Between December 2020 and January 2021, Accellion patched a group of vulnerabilities in
its 20-year-old FTA file transfer software. However, by that point, threat actors had already
exploited them to steal data from Accellion customers and partners and subsequently began
contacting those customers and partners to threaten to leak the stolen data and demand a
ransom; by February 2021, victim data had begun appearing on the Cl0p ransomware
5/17

group’s leak site. Analysts estimated at the time that the attacks affected 100 organizations,
25 of which experienced severe data thefts. Educational institutions, including Stanford
University, the University of California system, the University of Colorado, the University of
Miami, the University of Maryland, Baltimore, and at least one state government were among
the affected organizations.
Thus far, breaches at two different educational technology (edtech) providers, Illuminate
Education and Battelle for Kids, have affected public school districts’ data in 2022; at least
one of these (Battelle) was the result of a ransomware attack. Illuminate Education
announced in January that service disruptions reported by customers, including the New
York City public school system, were the result of an unspecified security incident. Then, in
March, Illuminate informed New York City officials that the incident had also led to a data
breach that exposed 820,000 New York City students’ personal data. Some features of this
incident resemble a ransomware attack, but public sources have not yet formally identified it
as one. In a similar event publicly acknowledged as a ransomware incident, in April, a group
of Ohioschool districts began announcing breaches resulting from a December 2021 attack
against edtech provider Battelle for Kids, with the much larger Chicago public school system
announcing in May that the Battelle attack had also impacted it, leading to a breach of
500,000 students’ and 60,000 teachers’ data.
Even in the wake of their respective security incidents, SecurityScorecard’s platform
indicates that Battelle and Illuminate both suffer from issues attackers (including ransomware
operators) could exploit. Previous leaks have exposed personal information belonging to
employees of both organizations, and other leaks have exposed passwords associated with
Battelle email addresses. An attacker could use exposed personal information to craft
compelling phishing messages, and ransomware attacks have often used employee
credentials (like passwords that employees use across different accounts and fail to change
after their exposure in a breach) to access target systems. Both could be susceptible to
phishing attacks: 17 domains attributed to Battelle for Kids lack Sender Policy Framework
(SPF) records, and the SPF record for one Illuminate Education subsidiary, IO Education,
indicates a misconfiguration. SPF can help prevent email spoofing, but in its absence, threat
actors can more easily craft and distribute phishing emails that can be more convincing
because they appear to have originated from within a target organization. SecurityScorecard
also observed open FTP services at an IP address attributed to Battelle as recently as June
17. Speaking generally, attackers may take an interest in file-sharing services because they
offer a means of accessing victim data, but some ransomware groups have taken a particular
interest in it. For example, Sophos warned in February 2021 that it had observed the Conti
group using FTP to steal victim data. Software in use on June 20 and 21 at Illuminateattributed IP addresses also appeared to be affected by high-severity vulnerabilities first
identified in 2016 and 2018, which could indicate patch management issues that could be

6/17

especially concerning given that ransomware often exploits unpatched vulnerabilities. Other
issues, while not necessarily targeted by ransomware groups, may nonetheless indicate an
ongoing risk.
SecurityScorecard has previously researched the links between our scorecard factors and
ransomware attacks to identify which of the issues we observe are more prevalent among
ransomware victims than in other organizations. Many of the issue types identified in this
research also affect Battelle for Kids and Illuminate Education. Exposed personal information
(observed for both companies, as discussed above) was almost 40% more prevalent among
the ransomware cohort than non-victim organizations. SecurityScorecard observed TLS
services that support weak protocols in use in Battelle’s and Illuminate’s networks; this
finding is over 30% more prevalent among ransomware victims than non-victims.
SecurityScorecard’s earlier research also noted that two other TLS flaws, TLS Service
Supports Weak Cipher Suite, and Certificate Without Revocation Control, are respectively
30% and 29% more prevalent in the ransomware cohort than in the control group.
SecurityScorecard has found a TLS Service at a Battelle for Kids-attributed IP address to
support a weak cipher suite and a TLS certificate at an Illuminate Education-linked IP
address to lack revocation control. Together, these findings suggest that both Battelle for
Kids and Illuminate Education may share a profile similar to many ransomware victims, even
if only one of the two companies has publicly disclosed a ransomware incident in recent
months.
Case Study: Alexandria, Louisiana
SecurityScorecard’s investigation into the attack against the government of Alexandria,
Louisiana, by the ALPHV group revealed some possible insights, including a series of
suspicious network flows (netflows) in the days before the attack.
On May 30 and 31, 151 flows between 199.38.59[.]80 (an IP address attributed to the City of
Alexandria) and 149.255.169[.]10 took place over UDP. These occurred within fairly narrow
timeframes: the 25 flows on May 30 occurred between 16:26:25 and 16:28:54 UTC, and the
126 flows on May 31 all occurred between 11:22:14 and 11:42:12 UTC. SecurityScorecard’s
netflow tool has previously linked 149.255.169[.]10 to malicious bot and Cobalt Strike activity.
ASI has, moreover, revealed remote access services in use at open ports at the Alexandria
IP address in question:

7/17

ASI also found a port indicative of VPN activity open at the other IP address involved in
these flows; Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) is a VPN protocol that operates on
TCP port 1723, a port that ASI indicates is open at 149.255.169[.]10. While PPTP is widely
regarded as outdated, VPNs can also use UDP (the protocol over which the observed
communication occurred) in its stead.

While VPNs do not necessarily indicate malicious activity, threat actors use them regularly to
obfuscate their traffic and communications.
These 151 flows make up the bulk of the observed traffic involving this particular Alexandriaattributed IP (199.38.59[.]80), which comprised 186 flows in total and may represent a
particularly concentrated period within a broader pattern of suspicious activity. The first flow
within SecurityScorecard’s sample took place between 199.38.59[.]80 and 41.93.45[.]129 on
May 21. Other vendors have observed this IP address leading to a download of a malicious
javascript file, and ASI observed a malware infection active there on the same day as this
flow:

8/17

The malicious file in question has, moreover, figured in previous SecurityScorecard research,
which linked it to possible Russian C2 infrastructure. The number of bytes observed in this
flow (1500, or 15 KB) is only slightly larger than the javascript file in question (10.66 KB).
The following day (May 22), the same Alexandria IP address communicated with a
neighboring IP address, 41.93.45[.]130. Vendors have linked that address to malicious
activity and ASI observed malware infections at it only slightly before this flow:

9/17

Then, on May 23, a 327-KB data transfer from 178.128.55[.]198 took place. Nine vendors
have detected malicious activity involving this IP address; it has hosted a domain that
appears to impersonate Apple (icdn-appieid[.]com) and, more recently, was observed leading
to a download of a malicious text file detected as Win32.Trojan.Raasj.Auto.
These three flows used TCP, but after them, many others, like the 151 involving
149.255.169[.]10, used UDP. This sudden shift to UDP may reflect the use of a VPN to
communicate with threat actor infrastructure following an initial compromise represented by
these first three suspicious TCP flows.
While this traffic may be benign (internal log data could further elucidate it), these findings
suggest that the above-discussed IP addresses merit further investigation, as the timing of
the traffic involving them suggests that they may have played a role in the attack against the
Alexandria government.
Case Study: Somerset County, New Jersey
On May 24, the government of Somerset County, New Jersey, announced it had suffered a
ransomware attack earlier that day, which disabled the county’s email system and disrupted
Somerset County Clerk and Surrogate services requiring internet connectivity or access to
county databases. Following the disclosure of the incident, SecurityScorecard researchers
consulted our internal scan data and netflow tool in hopes of enriching the publicly available
information about the attack. SecurityScorecard observed several vulnerabilities commonly
leveraged by ransomware groups on Somerset County’s network.

10/17

SecurityScorecard observed that Somerset County’s main domain, somerset[.]nj[.]us, lacked
an SPF (sender policy framework) record as recently as May 23. SPF can help prevent email
spoofing by verifying that emails claiming to originate from a given domain are coming from a
server with a legitimate relationship to that domain, thus reducing the risk of successful
phishing attacks. A threat actor could, for example, have begun spoofed emails from
somerset[.]nj[.]us to phish Somerset County employees at the beginning of the ransomware
attack against the county. As SecurityScorecard’s recent cases have also revealed, phishing
remains a common means of initial access for ransomware. With that said, recent years
have also seen ransomware groups use a remote desktop protocol to access victim systems
with increasing frequency.
SecurityScorecard additionally observed FTP services publicly available at three Somerset
County-attributed IP addresses, 64.206.95[.]16, 64.206.95[.]15, and 64.206.95[.]23. As
discussed above, researchers have observed ransomware groups and other threat actors
exploiting FTP in the past.
As seen above, exploitation of known vulnerabilities also remains a common feature of
ransomware attacks, and SecurityScorecard observed a number of CVEs affecting Somerset
County IP addresses. Five of these, in particular, 64.206.95[.]22, 64.206.95[.]27,
64.206.95[.]24, 64.206.77[.]196, and 64.206.95[.]21 may suffer from one especially
prominent and relatively recent vulnerability, Spring4Shell, the exploitation of which, some
commentators note, could facilitate the deployment of ransomware.
SecurityScorecard’s netflow data revealed a notable amount of traffic that may indicate
attackers’ use of Cobalt Strike against Somerset County. From April 24 to May 24 (the month
leading up to the Somerset County government’s detection of the attack), the netflow data
available to SecurityScorecard revealed 41,972 flows between the IP addresses attributed to
Somerset County and IP addresses linked to Cobalt Strike command-and-control
infrastructure. Some of this traffic may have been part of the attack reported on May 24.
According to Cisco research conducted in 2020, 66% of ransomware attacks observed that
year used Cobalt Strike. More recently, in February 2022, Cybereason’s Global SOC Team
analyzed an attack they attribute to a Conti ransomware affiliate that began with
spearphishing directed at employees of the victim organization and later deployed Cobalt
Strike. Given the SPF issue mentioned above, it is not unthinkable that the attack against
Somerset County followed a similar trajectory.
To identify the most concerning IP addresses involved in the almost 42,000 flows that could
reflect the use of Cobalt Strike against Somerset County, SecurityScorecard researchers first
limited the results to those involving Somerset County IP addresses where
SecurityScorecard’s platform observed issues, as these issues could represent
vulnerabilities that adversary may be more likely to target. They then sorted the results by

11/17

byte count in order to identify the Cobalt Strike-tagged IP addresses involved in the largest
data transfers. The top 10 IP addresses linked to Cobalt Strike and involved in large data
transfers to or from Somerset County are the following (in order of byte count):
1. 165.225.242[.]248
2. 208.87.239[.]180
3. 208.40.200[.]194
4. 192.216.142[.]51
5. 162.142.125[.]211
6. 174.128.243[.]54
7. 154.89.5[.]80
8. 70.39.102[.]189
9. 128.14.133[.]58
10. 174.128.243[.]54

Researchers then identified additional traffic involving other IP addresses located in the
same countries as these known malicious IPs when the countries in question are ones with
which a US local government would be unlikely to communicate. This led SecurityScorecard
to observe large data transfers between vulnerable Somerset assets and IP addresses in
India and Bangladesh in the weeks leading up to the attack. Researchers observed a total of
2,109 flows between the county government’s assets and Indian IP addresses. Traffic
between Indian IP addresses and those attributed to the Somerset County government is in
and of itself something of an anomaly: the vast majority of traffic occurred within the US, as
reflected in the graph below:

12/17

Despite the low frequency of the traffic, the volume of the data it transferred was quite large:
flows involving Indian IP addresses had an average byte count of 3,363,767, more than
double the overall average (1,576,056 bytes). Because traffic between Somerset County IPs
and Indian IPs appears uncommon, the amount of data transferred in that traffic was
anomalously large. The transfers occurred in the lead-up to a ransomware deployment, and
threat actors have been observed abusing Indian infrastructure in previous attacks. Of the IP
addresses appearing in the attack, 103.240.208[.]197 may represent a particular cause for
concern. SecurityScorecard’s netflow tool has associated it with Cobalt Strike, and
researchers detected a transfer of 156,000 bytes between it and one vulnerable Somerset
County IP address, 64.206.95[.]4, on May 24, the date Somerset County detected and
disclosed the attack against it.
In contrast to those located in India, the Bangladeshi IP addresses communicating with
Somerset County assets were both rarer and transferred smaller amounts of data. Between
April and May 24, they only appeared in 40 flows and had an average byte count of 506,863.
However, in addition to the links SecurityScorecard’s netflow tool established between some
of these IPs and malicious bot activity, the heavy concentration of the traffic on certain
specific dates appears somewhat suspicious. Of these 40 flows, 18 occurred on May 8 and
involved larger data transfers than the overall average of 506,863; on May 8, the flows’
average byte count was 1,113,500. Although the IP involved, 103.92.85[.]202, has not
previously been linked to ransomware, it likely merits investigation, if not blocking, because
traffic between Somerset County IPs and Bangladeshi IPs appears uncommon. The amount
of data transferred in that traffic was anomalously large and the transfers occurred in the
lead-up to a ransomware deployment. Moreover, other members of the cybersecurity
community have previously linked it to brute force attacks targeting RDP. Ransomware
groups often compromise RDP for initial access.
Traffic on another day, May 12, represented the next-largest portion of the flows observed:
14 occurred on that day. They all involved one Bangladeshi IP, 37.111.205[.]165, which
another vendor has linked to Cobalt Strike. Their average byte count (6,957.5 bytes),
however, was considerably smaller than the one observed on May 8.
13/17

Findings:
Recent incident response efforts in which SecurityScorecard was involved do, in general,
indicate that ransomware groups’ TTPs have remained largely continuous with those
employed in 2021, with the exploitation of known vulnerabilities remaining a consistent
feature of recent attacks. However, the vulnerabilities exploited have changed as
researchers publish new CVEs.
Thus far in 2022, Confluence, GitHub, and Apache vulnerabilities have figured particularly
prominently in SecurityScorecard cases. Since its publication in February, CVE-2021-44228
(an Apache vulnerability also tracked as “Log4Shell” because it affects Apache’s Log4j
software library) has figured in approximately six incidents to which SecurityScorecard
responded. More recently published research may also reflect the exploitation of Confluence
vulnerabilities observed by SecurityScorecard. Analysts first reported that they had observed
the Cerber ransomware group exploiting CVE-2021-26084. This vulnerability permits
attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected versions of Atlassian’s Confluence Server
and Data Center products in December 2021. Atlassian later advised Confluence users that
a new remote code execution vulnerability, CVE-2022-26134, was under active exploitation
on June 2. By June 11, researchers had observed at least two ransomware groups (including
the aforementioned Cerber) exploiting it. In one particularly glaring incident,
SecurityScorecard observed 64 open CVEs, including both Log4Shell and a GitHub
vulnerability on a client’s system.
Despite targeting newer vulnerabilities, systems that remain unpatched long after the
publication of a CVE will also remain low-hanging fruit for attackers. In one recent
engagement with a municipal emergency response service, SecurityScorecard determined
that a threat actor had originally accessed the target’s network through its VPN, exploiting a
vulnerability in its firewall, which the victim organization had not updated in over a year. In
this particular case, the adversary remained in the victim’s network for months and loaded,
but ultimately did not deploy ransomware on its systems. The decision not to encrypt this
organization’s devices, and particularly the time it took for the threat actors to reach that
decision, may reflect a wider trend.
Despite these general continuities with previously established trends, recent cases have also
revealed two novel features of ransomware operations in 2022: increasing dwell time and
aggression. In the municipal emergency service incident, SecurityScorecard determined that
the attacker spent 90 days in the victim system prior to detection. According to
SecurityScorecard experts, this reflects a broader trend: threat actors are taking their time
more. Threat actors often do not know what data they are stealing during exfiltration, but if
they have gone undetected, they increasingly appear to be willing to spend the time to figure
out what data they can access and what it is worth. In previous cases, SecurityScorecard
was able to determine that attackers viewed some data but did not exfiltrate it, likely because
they believed that they could not monetize it, a belief likely shaped by time constraints–they
14/17

were unwilling or unable to spend the time to study victim data and make an informed
assessment of its value. However, longer dwell times may suggest that actors hope to make
more informed decisions about what data they can monetize.
More than just seeking to evaluate the data available to them, in the municipal emergency
response case, the adversaries disabled the victim’s anti-virus software to avoid detection.
They then spent some of their 90-day dwell time attempting further vertical and lateral
movement, perhaps in hopes of breaching more lucrative targets. From the emergency
service, for example, attackers tried to access the internal systems of other local government
bodies, including city hall, and launched DNS poisoning attacks from the infected system.
SecurityScorecard has also observed ransomware groups taking increasingly aggressive
steps to pressure their victims to pay ransom. In addition to the secondary and tertiary
extortion methods mentioned above, attackers have taken more personal steps in recent
incidents, contacting friends and family members of executives of some affected
organizations to exert additional pressure.
Conclusion
Although some statistics suggest that the targeting of educational institutions by ransomware
operators has decreased in 2022, their targeting of local governments may have increased.
SecurityScorecard’s findings suggest that a number of issues affecting organizations in these
sectors could render them particularly vulnerable to ransomware. To reduce their
vulnerability, organizations should make every effort to keep software up to date; unpatched
software is easier to exploit. In addition to those appearing on previously-circulated lists of
CVEs frequently exploited by ransomware, those observed in recent SecurityScorecard
engagements may merit particular attention. They should also remain on guard against
phishing: frequent trainings would complement the use of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, which
can reduce the risk of email spoofing. While some credential exposures may be unavoidable,
organizations can also reduce the risks associated with these exposures by advising
employees against password reuse, requiring 2FA, and requiring fairly stringent length and
complexity requirements for passwords. While SecurityScorecard gathered and analyzed this
information to provide an overview of some of SecurityScorecard’s threat intelligence and
investigation capabilities as they relate to SLED organizations’ exposure to ransomware, the
discussion above may not serve as an exhaustive enumeration of every possible threat and
risk involving ransomware. However, SecurityScorecard can offer more tailored support for
SLED organizations both before and after ransomware attacks.

a Service (CRIaaS) offering. While this report should be considered trustworthy but
preliminary, our team can continue diving into these details and offer further support by
working with on-site staff at local government and educational institutions. We can, for
example, conduct additional analysis on the malware, targets, data transfer destinations, and
specific context around the leaked credentials at a given organization.
Attack Surface Intelligence
SecurityScorecard’s new Attack Surface Intelligence (ASI) solution gives you direct access to
SecurityScorecard’s deep threat intelligence data through a global tab on the ratings
platform.
ASI analyzes billions of sources to provide deep threat intelligence and visibility into any IP
address, network, domain, or vendor’s attack surface risk, from a single pane of glass. This
helps customers do more with the petabytes of data that forms the basis of
SecurityScorecard Ratings, including identifying all of an organization’s connected assets,
exposing unknown threats, conducting investigations at scale, and prioritizing vendor
remediation with actionable intelligence.
ASI is built into SecurityScorcard’s ratings platform through an enhanced Portfolio view or
global search across all Internet assets, leaked credentials, and infections and metadata
from the largest malware sinkhole in the world. Access ASI today through our Early Access
program by filling out the demo request form or contacting Assel Dmitriyeva.
Blueprint for Ransomware Defense
On August 4, the Institute for Security and Technology’s (IST) Ransomware Task Force
(RTF) announced the release of its Blueprint for Ransomware Defense - a clear, actionable
framework for ransomware mitigation, response, and recovery aimed at helping
organizations navigate the growing frequency of attacks.
SecurityScorecard is proud to be the only security ratings platform to sponsor and participate
in the development of the Blueprint and is one of only 5 organizations who participated in the
program’s development.
