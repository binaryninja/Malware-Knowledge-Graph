Renewed SideWinder Activity in South Asia
deependresearch.org/2021/03/renewed-sidewinder-activity-in-south.html

A few months ago, Trend Micro released a post which encapsulated the SideWinder APT
group activity in the past year, showcasing SideWinder’s mobile malware development
aspirations and spear phishing campaigns targeting the government and military of Nepal,
the government of Afghanistan, the Myanma Posts and Telecommunications state owned
company, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and several other entities.
The SideWinder APT which is also tracked as RAZOR TIGER, APT-C-17, and Rattlesnake is
known to pick its targets in the South Asia region in multiple previous campaigns [1, 2, 3].
SideWinder’s targets mainly consist of the countries of Nepal, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and
China along with some other target countries from the group’s known past activity. This
threat group is somewhat believed to be associated with Indian interests and seems to
mainly choose to target government and military entities in its espionage attacks.
While we were hunting through world scan data provided by BinaryEdge, we encountered an
interesting server during our research which was hosting an executable file that led us on a
path to uncover a renewed set of activity being conducted by the SideWinder group - picking
right where they left off from in their previous year of operation.
Key Findings:
The group renewed its spear phishing activity with new domains registered targeting
government entities in Nepal.
Nepal recently cancelled its upcoming elections scheduled for 30 April and 10 May
2021.
Uncovered evidence of the group likely targeting Nepal's Election Commission.
Evidence of continued efforts of malware development being conducted by the group.

Command and Control

1/15

The server which was the initial point in our investigation was hosting the following shellcode
we identified in the scan response we checked on port 8087.

Server's raw response showing an expected C2 domain connection.

Outputting this raw data for initial analysis and triage, we managed to figure out this was
most likely 2nd stage malware being used for Command and Control purposes through this
server.

2/15

PE-Studio showing us the malware's used libraries, headers, references, and compilation
date.

And as we continued our search throughout the server, we realized that it was also
communicating with what looked to be 1st stage malware via port 8085. We think that such
1st stage malware is being used in SideWinder’s spear phishing attacks, and we suspect
that a sample of one was uploaded in January to VirusTotal.
Upon further search, we managed to find the 2nd stage payload that was being used by the
group and hosted on this server via a simple text file encoded in Base64. After a
straightforward decode, we were able to see the code used by the threat actor for the 2nd
stage payload they are utilizing.

3/15

Meterpreter 2nd Stage Payload code excerpt.

We immediately had our assumption verified, as we were able to see that the server is being
used for command and control purposes using a meterpreter based payload written in
Python.
First Stage Payload
An example of what we suspect this group is using that precedes the command and control
infrastructure we first laid eyes on was this malware file uploaded to VirusTotal:

4/15

An .hta file most likely attached to spear phishing emails.

We suspect that this actor is using malicious .hta files that are attached to emails containing
links to decoy document lures along with embedded 1st stage malware inside the hta files.
Here we see such an embedded link to a PE-file being disguised as a txt file being used to
deploy spyware upon execution.

Once this spyware is downloaded the malware will check for the environment it’s running in
and attempt to identify the infected machine’s IP address with an external HTTP request.

5/15

External request to an online IP check API.

Another Python based malware, this specific sample runs in the background after execution
and creates a database file of extracted logins from browser files, creates archived files of all
of the infected machine's downloads, documents, and desktop files to a then daunting task of
exfiltration.

Utilizing the WriteFile function to write the stolen data to files.
Immediately after execution the malware attempts to steal files, writing the stolen browser
data to a "Loginvault.db" file and .zip files using the folder location, the machine's IP address
and datestamp as the naming scheme.

6/15

Exfiltration attempt to the C2 server using port 8080.

This spyware sample takes us directly to the spear phishing efforts we suspect SideWinder
may be conducting while using similar malware techniques.

Spear Phishing

Another finding that we encountered while searching through the contents and configurations
of this server were the decoy pages SideWinder is using to phish against their intended
targets. When we looked at what was being hosted we were surprised to find the server as a
single staging point for a lot of the group’s phishing activity (on top of some mobile malware
development efforts we cover further along in the post).
The server we were investigating was using various dynamic DNS resolutions to the main IP
address and resolving almost all of the domain names with naming schemes that mimic the
naming convention of the real entities SideWinder are targeting.
SideWinder are still very adamant at focusing their attention on the same entities they’ve
previously attempted to target as showcased by Trend Micro’s report, while adding some
additional in-country organizations to their target list.
As of the last few weeks, it seems this group has renewed its activity and started to ramp up
attack efforts against their targets of choice. For example, through our investigation of the
server, we’ve managed to find that the group is renewing their efforts against government
entities of Nepal and setting up phishing infrastructure to launch such campaigns.

7/15

In our findings, it seems that SideWinder has added the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure
and Transport of Nepal to their list of targets and are still actively trying to gain access to
other government offices of the country.

Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport of Nepal domain and login panel.

Another such target in Nepal is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with a preceding lure intended
on motivating the recipient to login with their credentials to be able to continue reading the
decoy article planted by the threat actor. In this case, a press release by the Nepal Mission to
the UN pertaining to the COVID-19 situation around the region, and human rights issues.

8/15

Ministry of Foreign Affairs decoy lure.

A short while after accessing the link the unsuspecting reader will be redirected to the
Ministry’s login page.

After a redirect from the lure article, the reader is redirected to this login panel.

Here CapTipper is showcasing us the ~15 seconds it takes to get redirected from the initial
decoy article to the login panel.

9/15

The phishing efforts being conducted by the group in this activity are reliant on the content
delivery backbone of the actual target website to deliver all of the page's media and redirect
to it once credentials are entered. Meaning the actor controlled server just hosts basic
phishing kits which use the target's own content delivery network to mimic the respective
login panel which they are targeting.

The fake page making lookup requests to the real Nepal Foreign Affairs government
website.

Some other decoy tricks that are being employed by the group in this campaign are error
messages hardcoded in the phishing pages. Such as the one in a phishing page spoofing
the Nepal central government email system:

10/15

Source code showing the hardcoded error message.

Or an additional one hardcoded in the phishing page targeting the Ministry of Defense:

Ministry of Defense login panel with a hardcoded error.

We imagine this is a social engineering tactic employed by the actor in efforts of achieving
further enticement to enter login credentials by adding pretext to complete the action.
11/15

We have also witnessed renewed attention in efforts against organizations such as the Nepal
state owned Nepal Telecom company, while continuing the techniques of utilizing the real
website’s content backbone including the reCaptcha widget.

As you can see, the SideWinder group is still very interested in targeting entities located in
Nepal. With an additionally very interesting phishing page we managed to find being hosted
on this server to what we think is also a current and new target focus for the group.
This new phishing target seems to be the Election Commission of Nepal:

A phishing page targeting the Election Commission of Nepal

As we've shown previously, the actor is again utilizing the same tactic of loading the content
from the real government website and redirecting to it once credentials are entered:

This finding is particularly interesting considering the fact that Nepal was meant to be having
elections fast approaching in April and May of this year, only to be very recently overturned
as of last week.
Considering that these elections were only recently announced in the end of December
2020, we think that this proves as to some of the motivation behind the group’s renewed
activity and new target focus as of the past couple of months.
Conclusion

13/15

There were a few other findings we gathered from this server which we decided not to blog
about in this post as we didn't consider them much different from the phase of operations this
group was at at the end of last year. Like some which were connected to the mobile malware
applications being developed by SideWinder, as this part of their operations seems to be still
very much in the development and testing stage. As evident by what looks like internal
testing left behind by the developers.

Log left behind by the group.

We also can’t confirm that all of the phishing infrastructure we uncovered will indeed be
infected with malware or have a preceding malicious payload once in use. Even with the
proximity of the phishing pages residing on the same server with other malware it remains
unclear at this stage. Some of these pages may very well be used in single purpose
credential phishing campaigns.
On the other hand, what we did cover in this post indicates how SideWinder is very much
focused on conducting espionage operations against their target area of interest in South
Asia. Taking into account what this group has done in the past year; we see that we should
take this renewed activity as an indication that SideWinder will only continue to ramp up its
activities in the rest of the upcoming months of 2021 and beyond.
The group’s continued interest in Nepal serves as evidence to that – We can only speculate
that regional developments such as the potential elections in countries of the region,
geopolitical tensions such as the military clashes in the India-China border, international
events mixed in with regional efforts such as COVID-19 vaccine distribution, and other
regional interests will only continue to fuel such campaigns conducted by the group in South
Asia. We should anticipate more of such spear phishing activity and further development of

14/15

their malware and specific mobile malware capabilities to launch such campaigns against the
group’s targets of interest.
