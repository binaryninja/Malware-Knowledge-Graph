Executive Summary
ThreatConnect®, in partnership with Defense Group Inc., has attributed targeted cyber espionage infrastructure activity
associated with the “Naikon” Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group to the Chinese People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA)
Chengdu Military Region Second Technical Reconnaissance Bureau (Military Unit Cover Designator 78020). This
assessment is based on technical analysis of Naikon threat activity and native language research on a PLA officer
within Unit 78020 named Ge Xing.
For nearly five years, Unit 78020 has used an array of global midpoint infrastructure to proxy the command and
control of customized malware variants embedded within malicious attachments or document exploits. These
malicious attachments are operationalized within spear phishing campaigns that establish beachheads into target
organizations, facilitating follow on exploitation activities.
Unit 78020 conducts cyber espionage against Southeast Asian military, diplomatic, and economic targets. The
targets include government entities in Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam as well as international bodies such as United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
We assess Unit 78020’s focus is the disputed, resource-rich South China Sea, where China’s increasingly aggressive
assertion of its territorial claims has been accompanied by high-tempo intelligence gathering. The strategic implications
for the United States include not only military alliances and security partnerships in the region, but also risks to a major
artery of international commerce through which trillions of dollars in global trade traverse annually.
This report applies the Department of Defense-derived Diamond Model for Intrusion Analysis1 to a body of technical
and non-technical evidence to understand relationships across complex data points spanning nearly five years of
exploitation activity. The Diamond Model is an approach to analyzing network intrusion events. The model gets its
name and shape from the four core interconnected elements that comprise any event – adversary, infrastructure,
capability, and victim. Thus, analyzing security incidents – from a single intrusion up to a full campaign – essentially
involves piecing together the diamond using elements of information collected about these four facets to understand

the threat in its full and proper context over time.

Previous Works
In April of 2012, ShadowServer initially introduced what would later be known as Naikon as an “Unknown/Unnamed”
threat when they shared analysis2 of commingled spear phishing lures obtained from the HardCore Charlie3 data
dump. The Naikon APT would not achieve mainstream awareness until June 20134 when TrendMicro published a
detailed analysis of Naikon’s Rarstone malware.
The May 2014 ThreatConnect blog post “Piercing the Cow’s Tongue” – a reference to the shape of the nine-dashed
line China uses to demarcate its territorial claims in the South China Sea – tied Naikon to the most prolific and brazen
targeting campaign against Southeast Asian nations.5 A year later, Kaspersky Labs published a comprehensive white
paper detailing historic Naikon activity and key technical findings.6 Kaspersky also independently concluded the Naikon
APT appeared to be a dedicated and resourced effort focused on targeting Southeast Asian countries, noting Naikon
was responsible for an “incredible volume of attack activity around the South China Sea that has been going on since
at least 2010.”

Why We Are Releasing this Analysis
Ultimately, we believe it is our responsibility to inform our global user base and bring these findings to light for public
consideration. ThreatConnect has demonstrated commitment to this ideal by freely sharing threat intelligence and
providing an industry-recognized platform in which others can aggregate, analyze, and act against common threats.
As the most widely adopted and comprehensive Threat Intelligence Platform on the market, we understand good
intelligence goes beyond just tactical indicators; it must provide sufficient context to enable more informed decisions.
To that end, we hope this report serves as an example of the level of full-bodied threat intelligence analysis we seek to
enable for our users and encourage within the community.
The ThreatConnect/DGI team acknowledges the controversial nature of such a public indictment and recognizes that
exposing the truth is not always popular. We expect the initial reaction by some will be to condemn the messenger
rather than the military unit responsible for the activity revealed in this report. Others will surely marginalize or question
the private sector’s mandate for conducting such research despite Executive Order 13691’s (Promoting Private Sector
Cybersecurity Information Sharing)7 recognition of the private sector’s obligation to share information to mitigate
common risks.
In answering the call of EO 13691, we have carefully sought to allay innate skepticism by meeting it head-on with
detailed infrastructure analysis overlaid against geopolitical and “pattern of life” activities that buttress the aggregate
body of evidence, which cannot be muted by the staccato of official dismissals and denials to which the court of world
opinion has become so accustomed.
In addition to this report, ThreatConnect has released technical indicators we have associated with Naikon activity
within the ThreatConnect Common Community, which is accessible by registering for a free account on
infrastructure leveraged by Naikon globally for nearly half a decade. Rather, it forms one chapter of a larger story, where
we look forward to enriching and expanding future collaborative research within our community of users and partners.

Key Findings
The Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Group commonly known within the information-security industry as
“Naikon” is associated with the People’s Liberation Army Chengdu Military Region (MR) Second Technical
Reconnaissance Bureau (TRB) Military Unit Cover Designator (MUCD) 78020.

The PLA’s Chengdu MR Second TRB Military Unit
Cover Designator (MUCD) Unit 78020 (78020部队)
operates primarily out of Kunming, China with an area
of responsibility that encompasses border regions,
Southeast Asia, and the South China Sea.

Naikon APT supports Unit 78020’s mandate to
perform regional computer network operations, signals
intelligence, and political analysis of the Southeast
Asian border nations, particularly those claiming
disputed areas of the energy-rich South China Sea.

GreenSky27
Analysis of historic command and control (C2)
infrastructure used consistently within Naikon malware
for espionage operations against Southeast Asian targets
has revealed a strong nexus to the city of Kunming,
capital of Yunnan Province in Southwestern China.

The C2 domain “greensky27.vicp.net” consistently
appeared within unique Naikon malware, where the moniker
“GreenSky27” is the personification of the entity who
owns and operates the malicious domain. Further research
shows many social media accounts with the “GreenSky27”
username are maintained by a PRC national named Ge Xing
(葛星), who is physically located in Kunming.

In eight individual cases, notable overlaps of Ge
Xing’s pattern of life activities would match patterns
identified within five years of greensky27.vicp.net
infrastructure activity.

Ge Xing, a.k.a. “GreenSky27,” has been identified as a
member of the PLA specializing in Southeast Asian politics,
specifically Thailand. He is employed by Unit 78020 most
notably evidenced by his public academic publications and
routine physical access to the PLA compound.

The littoral states have long contested the various reefs, atolls, and islands in the South China Sea. China, the
Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Taiwan all claim the disputed Spratly Islands – a string of geographic features
rich in energy and fisheries. China’s claims are the most sweeping, with Beijing claiming most of the disputed
South China Sea as sovereign territory. Confrontations between claimants have ranged from mere harassment of
commercial fishing and military vessels11 to deadly clashes.12,13
As the Council on Foreign Relations notes, “These tensions are shaping – and being shaped by – rising
apprehensions about the growth of China’s military power and its regional intentions. China has embarked on a
substantial modernization of its maritime paramilitary forces as well as naval capabilities to enforce its sovereignty
and jurisdiction claims by force if necessary.”14
Dominating the South China Sea is a key step for Beijing towards regional hegemony, and the other claimants are
both weaker and lack the security guarantees from the U.S. that have helped to temper similar tensions with Japan
in the East China Sea.
Over the last year, China has adopted a more aggressive posture in the region. China is increasingly deploying the
Chinese Coast Guard to enforce its claims over features in the South China Sea and operates PLA Navy vessels over
the horizon so they are ready to respond to escalation. China’s maritime law enforcement fleet, comprised primarily
of Chinese Coast Guard vessels, is likely to increase in size by 25 percent and is larger than all of the other claimants
combined, according to the Department of Defense.15 China also relies heavily on its offensive cyber capabilities to
gather intelligence on regional military, diplomatic, and economic intentions regarding the South China Sea. Behind
the scenes, China is mounting a robust computer-network exploitation campaign against claimants, and Unit 78020
is one of the primary players involved in the Chinese cyber response.

Fiery Cross Reef: A Case Study on How China Combines Cyber
with Other Elements of National Power

Airbus DS and IHS Jane’s.

To bolster their claims in the South China Sea, regional states have built islands by dredging seafloor material and
depositing it atop coral reefs, a process that irreversibly destroys the reef.16 Over the last 18 months, “China has
reclaimed over 2,000 acres, more than all other claimants combined…and more than in the entire history of the
region.”17 This activity is most notable on Fiery Cross Reef. In its natural state, Fiery Cross Reef is submerged at high
tide. Between August and November 2014, Chinese dredgers created a landmass that spans the entire existing reef,
increasing the land area 11 times over.18
“China insists that its landfill work is intended to provide public goods such as lighthouses, typhoon shelters for
fishermen, weather stations, and search-and-rescue facilities,” according to The Economist.19 However, the Chinese
have also built a 1.9-mile-long runway capable of supporting any of China’s military aircraft, turning Fiery Cross into a
useful power projection platform and raising concern that China’s ultimate purpose is military in nature. In May 2015, a
Chinese admiral said Beijing could set up an air defense identification zone above disputed areas of the South China
Sea if it thought it was facing a large enough threat.20
Although the U.S. does not take an official position on ownership of the Spratly Islands, it has reiterated its commitment
to freedom of navigation. In late May 2015, the U.S. Navy flew a surveillance mission21 around Fiery Cross Reef and
stated its intent to continue conducting routine surveillance flights, even having the U.S. Commander of the Pacific Fleet
Admiral Scott Swift on one mission.22

The Philippines has taken a different approach by trying to use the weight of international law. Countries can claim
a 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off the coast of their mainlands and habitable islands under
the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the primary source of international law on this
subject. The Philippines is seeking a ruling on whether China’s building on submerged reefs confers the right to
territorial waters and EEZs. China has refused to participate in arbitration thus far,23 claiming the tribunal does not
have jurisdiction.
Beijing’s unwillingness to participate in international arbitration has not stopped it from surreptitiously monitoring
those interested in the case. In early July 2015, Chinese APT actors (not associated with Naikon) used an Adobe Flash
Player exploit within official Permanent Court of Arbitration webpages detailing the case between the Philippines and
China. The exploit appeared on day three of the Netherlands-based Permanent Court of Arbitration tribunal and
altered the webpage to load a malicious URL when visited, which would allow the adversary to exploit vulnerable web
browsers and deploy a malicious payload to the victim host. The tactic of leveraging strategic website compromises
with patched or unpatched exploits is a well-known observable used consistently by many APT groups. Additional
technical details on this attack can be found in the July 2015 ThreatConnect blog post “China Hacks the Peace
Palace.”24 China’s efforts to target the tribunal underscore how Beijing integrates its cyber assets on a routine basis
with its diplomatic, political, and military initiatives.

The Naikon APT: Conducting Geopolitically Motivated Campaigns
Since 2010
conducting high-volume, high-profile, geopolitically motivated attacks over at least five years.25 Kaspersky assesses
Naikon has a high success rate infiltrating national organizations in countries affiliated with the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) with early victims located mostly throughout Myanmar, Vietnam, Singapore, Laos,
Malaysia, and the Philippines. Target profiles included high-profile government and military agencies around the
South China Sea as well as state media and energy organizations both public and private. Appendix A: Naikon Oil
& Gas-Themed Activity illustrates an example of Naikon activity likely seeking to exploit those interested in strategic
regional energy resources.
The structure of Naikon operations suggests campaigns focused on individual countries, with specific toolsets deployed
against a range of organizations within the designated country. To get into target networks, the Naikon APT relies on
email as an attack vector and precise social engineering to identify appropriate targets. Data collection prior to an attack
has included full names, email addresses, date of birth, interests in current events, nationality, gender, and previous
email and social network communications to and from a target. Kaspersky notes how the Naikon APT used a United
Nations discussion and vote on nuclear proliferation and disarmament, the missing Malaysian Airlines MH370 flight, and
construction on the Raytheon-built National Coast Watch Center in the Philippines as decoy content for attacks. They
conclude Naikon’s use of decoys that maintain regional topics of interest reveals the APT’s specific victims and how
they change over time more strikingly than typically seen by other malicious actors. Additional examples of Naikon’s use
of stolen ASEAN draft talking points and classified Philippines documents can be found in the May 2014 ThreatConnect
blog post “Piercing the Cow’s Tongue: China Targeting South China Sea Nations.”26
The structure of Naikon’s campaigns, nature of the targets, and reliance on precision social engineering support our
hypothesis that the Naikon APT is PLA Unit 78020, which will be proven conclusively with technical evidence in Chapter Two.

Unit 78020 and PLA Regional Cyber Operations
Each of the PLA’s seven military regions has technical reconnaissance bureaus (TRBs), assessed to provide signals
intelligence and cyber reconnaissance support.27 TRBs appear to be tasked with communications intelligence,
direction finding, traffic analysis, translation, cryptology, computer network defense, and computer network
exploitation.
The Kunming TRB is one of ten military region TRBs located throughout China, and it is also known by its military unit
cover designator (MUCD) as Unit 78020. Chinese military units are given MUCDs, five-digit numerical sequences,
to provide basic anonymity for the unit in question and as a standardized reference. MUCDs are also used in official
publications and on the Internet to refer to the unit in question.28 Additional information on TRBs can be found in
Appendix B: Technical Reconnaissance Bureaus.
In addition to conducting network reconnaissance and computer network operations, TRBs maintain a staff of
linguists and regional analysts, who may be involved in traffic analysis and reporting as well as regional political,
military, and economic analysis.29 A survey of academic journal articles published by authors affiliated with Unit
78020 include not only papers related to communications technologies, network security, cryptanalysis, and social
network analysis, but also publications on politics in Thailand and Vietnam and ASEAN science and technology

analysis of one very interesting part of Unit 78020’s
vast operational infrastructure. Our goal is to describe
and profile the greensky27.vicp.net domain in order to
develop a better understanding of the scope, structure,
and activities of the adversary controlling it.

Like other APTs, Unit 78020 leverages dynamic domain infrastructure to improve the survivability and mobility of their
custom malware. This allows network exploitation operators to quickly shift their C2 to new hosts without expending
costly resources to refit and redeploy their malware due to a hard-coded IP address.
Unit 78020’s infrastructure maintains a notably regionalized theme, with naming conventions consistent with South
and Southeast Asian entities under its area of responsibility. On the next page we can map clusters of Unit 78020
infrastructure to their corresponding regionalized themes.
In addition to regionalized naming conventions, Unit 78020’s personnel have in rare instances personified or
personalized the infrastructure. Mandiant provided one such example in its APT 1 report revealing the “UglyGorilla”
persona to be Unit 61398’s Wang Dong.33

HOW DO ADVERSARIES BUILD MALICIOUS INFRASTRUCTURE?
We focus a lot on a particular set of adversary infrastructure in this section, but some readers may wonder
how such large-scale malicious networks come to be in the first place. There are many ways an adversary
can accomplish this. They can use infrastructure they own directly, but most adversaries know this is a
sure-fire way to get caught. To add degrees of separation, they can buy or rent from another adversary
or accomplice. Abusing infrastructure belonging to a legitimate and unwitting service provider is another
avenue. Many build-it-yourself options exist, most of which involve compromising hosts on the Internet in
some way and maintaining them over time through a combination of either legitimate remote management/
administration and backdoor command/control (C2) malware.

Naikon Malware Associations
Specific to our current research, a member of Unit 78020 maintained the personified hostname greensky27.vicp.net
subsection does not analyze the technical intricacies of those samples. Our goal is merely to highlight the subset of
Naikon malware families configured to communicate with the dynamic domain greensky27.vicp.net and then pivot to
an in-depth analysis of that infrastructure.

a self-extracting executable). This decoy is in the form of a Microsoft Word document containing a Thai language
article and pictures from a Royal Thai Navy June 28, 2012 news release35 depicting Vietnamese fishermen detained
for fishing within the Thai exclusive economic zone (EEZ). The decoy content is consistent with Naikon’s practice of
using topical geopolitical events as bait to interact with malicious files. The primary takeaway, however, is the direct
association between various instances of Naikon malware and the greensky27.vicp.net domain. With that connection
established, we turn our investigation to the infrastructure behind greensky27.vicp.net.

Domain Infrastructure Analysis
By fusing ThreatConnect’s active DNS together with passive DNS data sets, we constructed a timeline of resolutions
to the greensky27.vicp.net domain. Activity stretches back to September 2010 and continues up to the drafting of
this report in August 2015. Our records show 2,350 resolutions to almost 1,236 unique IP addresses spanning 26
cities and eight countries over that time frame. Figure 5 plots the scope of greensky27.vicp.net autonomous system
numbers (ASN) on a world map.

Figure 5: ASNs of IPs associated with greensky27.vcip.net.

The physical geography is both interesting and telling. We immediately see heavy Chinese and Southeast Asian
representation, supporting our earlier statements regarding Unit 78020’s South China Sea regional focus. There are also
a few hosts in the continental U.S. that seem far from the fray but will prove to play a big role as our investigation unfolds.
Interestingly, we see no representation from regions often synonymous with financial cybercrime and “rent-a-botnet”

We immediately see heavy Chinese and Southeast Asian representation, supporting

While Figure 5 shows physical regions of interest associated with greensky27.vicp.net, Figure 6 provides insight into
the roles and relationships of the underlying infrastructure.

IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS FOR THIS SECTION
}} DNS Resolution: We use “resolution” or “resolved” in this report in reference to mappings between
a domain and an IP address. Each time DNS records show the domain resolving to a different IP
address, we count that as a resolution for the purposes of our analysis. We are NOT referring to
individual DNS requests or lookups from individual clients. To add variety, we may use generic terms
like “switch,” “transition,” “hop,” or “mapping” but all should be understood to refer to the same concept
as “resolution.”
}} Resolution Duration: We use “duration” to reference the amount of time (in hours) DNS records show
the domain resolved to a given IP address before changing to another.

Figure 6: Network graph of IP address locations associated with the greensky27.vcip.net dynamic domain.

The network graph in Figure 6 weighs each location based upon how central it is within the greensky27.vicp.net
infrastructure. The dot size coincides with the number of DNS resolutions to IPs in that city. Connecting arcs show
DNS records moving between IPs in different cities clockwise from source to destination, and the thickness of the
arc captures the relative frequency of these transitions. There are several conclusions we can draw.
1. Nearly all roads lead to Kunming. Of the 27 cities identified, 22 show DNS resolutions into Kunming and
23 resolve out. No other city exhibits even half this number of connections (Bangkok comes closest
at 11 in and nine out). Thus, we infer that Kunming acts as a central hub or “home base” for the

2. Bangkok, Seoul, Hong Kong, and Denver are also important. They exhibit recurring interactions with other nodes
in the network, albeit not as heavy as Kunming. As later analysis will demonstrate, each of these nodes serves a
very unique purpose within the operator’s infrastructure.
3. There are many nodes with very few connections. Many transition only to one of the more central nodes
mentioned above. While the network-graphing algorithm may not see them as “important,” they still serve key
mission-specific functions. These too will be discussed later.

Kunming acts as a central hub or “home base” for

ANALYSIS OF RESOLUTION METRICS
We used two observable measures – the number of DNS resolutions and the duration of each resolution – to study
the greensky27.vicp.net infrastructure and how the adversary uses it to support their mission. Additional contextual
information (e.g., geolocation, ASN) or derivative metrics (e.g., total time or hops within a city) also factor into our
analysis but build upon those two base metrics. Distributions specific to these measures can be found within Figures
7 (resolutions) and 8 (durations) below.
50% IPs used only once
83% IPs used twice
99% IPs used < 3 times
Maximum usage of an
IP: 51 times

Both figures point to the dynamic nature of the greensky27.vicp.net domain. In Figure 7, about half of the IP addresses
recorded only one resolution over the five-year time frame, and less than one percent tallied more than three. An
extreme few racked up dozens of DNS records. Figure 8 reveals that while some resolutions persist for months,
These findings beg for further inquiry into hosts that, statistically speaking, stand out from the rest. From a network
defense perspective, this also reminds us of the limited utility of playing “whack-a-mole” with IPs, calling instead
for more effective methods of identifying, sharing, and blacklisting malicious infrastructure on the Internet.

With the goal of spotting outliers for further investigation, Figure 9 plots all IP addresses associated with
greensky27.vicp.net on a coordinate plane. The x-axis represents the average duration of a resolution to an IP
address and the y-axis represents the total number of DNS resolutions pointing to that IP. Most IPs share similar
characteristics, clustering in the lower left. Interestingly, the most distant outliers represent three different cities
in three different countries, each of which vary dramatically in their resolution-duration orientation. Rather than
speculating on this, we will take it at face value for now and simply follow the data’s lead into a city-centric analysis.

duration. It further strengthens the case for Kunming, Seoul, Bangkok, and Denver as major cities of interest in terms
of understanding the context and role of the greensky27.vicp.net infrastructure. Building on this, Figure 11 gives a
more detailed comparison of resolution metrics among these and other important cities identified in our analysis.

Figure 11: Resolution metrics per city.

The variation exhibited among cities in Figure 11 is readily apparent. Kunming, home of Unit 78020, dominates
everything, showing once again that it is the center of life, the universe, and everything insofar as
greensky27.vicp.net activity is concerned.37
The adversary resolves within Kunming more often, transitions between Kunming IP addresses, spends more overall
time, and seemingly “owns” more infrastructure in Kunming than any other geography by far. Denver, on the other
hand, stands a mile high above the rest in its own unique way. Denver’s single IP address boasted average durations

Denver’s single IP address boasted average durations more than six times
that of Kunming and more than double its next-closest competitor, Seoul.
Seoul and Bangkok show similar profiles, except a lot more time was spent in the former. It is difficult to discern much
about the other cities from this view, but the next visualization fixes that.
Figure 12 shows the proportionality for our resolution metrics relative to all cities associated with the
greensky27.vicp.net domain. It provides a city-centric perspective rather than the metric-centric one seen in Figure
11. This alleviates the Kunming predominance and lets us compare cities on more even footing. All factors being
equal, the ratio of resolutions to IPs to duration should be roughly the same across cities. Instead, the ratios vary
dramatically, which makes these findings very intriguing. We performed statistical significance tests on the domain
resolution data and confirmed the apparent differences among cities to be legitimate.38 We therefore conclude these
observations are meaningful rather than a mirage of random variations in the data. But what, exactly, do they mean?

This does not include subsequent intra-city IP hopping. We chose to omit these to better show resolution movement between cities in this figure. Otherwise,
total resolutions to Kunming IP space would literally be off the chart.
Hitchiker’s Guide fans will be interested to know it’s also home to TRB sub-unit 42 (true statement).
We compared resolution metrics among cities using One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The test yielded extremely significant results with a p-value of 1.71E-19.

Figure 12: Ratio of resolution metrics relative to each city.

INFRASTRUCTURE AND LOCATION PROFILES
We hypothesize varying ratios among resolution metrics reflect the location’s purpose and function
within the larger infrastructure or campaign. A high ratio of resolutions for a given location reveals levels of
access, control, and comfort. A cautious and wary adversary probably would not resolve into or within high-risk
areas repeatedly over a long period of time. Instead, comparatively frequent resolutions hint at a kind of safe and
familiar routine.
A heavy skewing of unique IPs corresponds to regional investment and/or control. Having a large pool of single-use
hosts within a region means infrastructure is easy to come by and suggests a high degree of ownership with low
attachment to individual hosts. Conversely, locations with only one or two IPs and frequent resolutions over several
years indicate strategic importance and value at both the host and location levels.
When the ratio of time resolved is comparably higher than the number of resolutions or unique IPs, it shows the
adversary has the motive and means to keep the domain static for long periods of time. Chapter Four provides
examples of why an adversary might do this.

From our analysis of the infrastructure behind greensky27.vicp.net, we infer three general infrastructure patterns
or profiles:
LOCAL IP SWITCHING
Kunming falls squarely in this camp, with a huge number of fleeting resolutions to single-use IPs throughout the
five-year time frame. This suggests a deep relationship between the adversary and the city of Kunming, and it may
also indicate a lack of operational security or oversight. We surmise the person controlling the greensky27.vicp.net
domain likely lives in or near Kunming and has installed the Oray Peanut Shell client, which automatically obtains
Kunming-based IP addresses from the local service provider’s address pool when his VPN connection is not active.
This is not dissimilar to someone’s laptop automatically grabbing new IP addresses as they move between home,
office, coffee shop, etc.
REMOTE COMMAND/CONTROL (C2)
Another pattern to note is brief, periodic resolutions to recurring IPs in a given location. This pattern accounts for a
majority of non-Chinese cities. This phenomenon is likely explained as routine intelligence collections on targets in
the South China Sea region. The actor connects to suborned hosts for traditional remote C2 and exits after acting
on the objective. We estimate the more hasty exits may simply be a by-product of quick connectivity checks to see
if victims are beaconing in. Alternatively, the actor may not be experiencing favorable operational conditions. Some
examples include network saturation and subsequent latency or the C2 IP address being blocked, forcing the actor
to transition to a different C2 to reacquire access to the victim implant(s).

Patterns observed in Denver, Seoul, and non-routable (0.0.0.0) suggest
they are likely used when the greensky27.vicp.net domain is either offline
for a given time or not interacting with routable infrastructure.

Patterns observed in Denver, Seoul, and non-routable (0.0.0.0) suggest they are likely used when the
greensky27.vicp.net domain is either offline for a given time or not interacting with routable infrastructure. They are
the only locations where total time resolved is disproportionately higher than unique IPs and resolutions. Seoul
serves as a mixed bag where some of Seoul’s multiple IPs are most likely used for adversary domain parking, while
others appear to be traditional remote C2 hosts. Figure 13 drives this point home visually by splitting out ASNs in
Seoul. ASN 10036 exhibits more of a C2 profile, while ASN 3786 closely mimics the parking pattern.

Figure 13: Ratio of resolution metrics relative to selected ASNs.

To test our hypothesis, we ran another statistical test39 comparing the resolution metrics of Denver and Seoul. The
results showed no significant difference between the two cities, which we would expect if both truly do share similar
profiles. To take this one step further, we incorporated “non-routable” resolutions (which we know to be adversary
domain parking) into another test,40 which also found no significant differences. This provides statistical confirmation
that patterns in Denver and Seoul mimic parking of one form or another. So as to not offend the “it’s easy to lie with
statistics” crowd, we took a calculated opsec risk and (after some due precautions) simply browsed to the Denver
IP address and greensky27.vicp.net to test this. Figure 14 is what we found. This confirmed our suspicions that
the greensky27.vicp.net domain will point to an IP address belonging to a Denver service provider when the user
is logged out of the Oray Peanut Shell client. Those curious as to “why Denver?” are referred to Appendix D: Oray

We used a t-test since we are comparing differences between two groups rather than three or more.
Back to ANOVA this time because we have three groups: Denver, Seoul, and “non-routable.”

THE BIG PICTURE IN MANY PIXELS
A normal picture might be worth 1,000 words, but Figure 15 is worth at least 2,000—the word count so far in this
section used to analyze the greensky27.vicp.net infrastructure. It shows all of the IPs that the greensky27.vcip.net

Figure 15: Network graph of all IP addresses associated with greensky27.vicp.net.

A few nexus nodes stand out in bright contrast to the field of lesser hosts. The three profiles discussed above are
readily apparent. The largest dots are the parking/offline IPs of Denver, Seoul, and 0.0.0.0 i.e. not routable. The
dense section of tiny specks in the middle is clearly the fast and fleeting local Kunming switching infrastructure.
Other slightly larger, but still small, dots of the same color likely fall in that pattern too, but they were used a bit longer
or more often than the pure burner IP addresses. The other small- to medium-sized, middle-layer nodes form the
collections infrastructure, most of which are C2 hosts located in target countries in the South China Sea region.
Thailand appears particularly prominent among C2 infrastructures in Figure 15, a fact that suggests it
may be the focal point of adversary collections activities.

respectively over the time frame of study. A possible storyline emerges from the visualization that goes something

Switching around Kunming and surrounding suburbs dominated the first two years, possibly the early days of the
adversary’s career, mission, or the campaign itself. 2012 marks a two-year rise in foreign collection activities, focused
largely in Thailand and Korea. As collections dwindled (either because the mission was completed or cut short), the
adversary increasingly parked the domain in Seoul before taking it offline with increasing regularity with a service
provider in Denver where it remains at the time of this writing. Whatever the correct interpretation, there is clearly an
important temporal – and perhaps human – aspect to the infrastructure worthy of further examination. To that end,
we will now turn to the man behind the GreenSky curtain.

The personified greensky27.vicp.net dynamic infrastructure stood out amongst C2 domain names used by the
Naikon APT due to its frequent resolution to hosts located in the Kunming, Yunnan Province and its strong correlation
with Naikon malware likely directed against Southeast Asian entities. Further investigation by DGI’s Chinese linguist
analysts matched the term “greensky27” to the username GreenSky27, used by a PLA officer named Ge Xing on a
personal QQ Weibo account, a Chinese microblogging platform, since July 2010 and on several other Chinese social
media platforms since at least 2004.

Confirming the Name: GreenSky27 is Ge Xing
Open source research into the term “greensky27” identified numerous accounts on Chinese online forums and
messaging platforms that appear to belong to a single account holder located in Kunming summarized in Appendix
E: Key Chinese Sources for GreenSky27. Of particular note, a QQ Weibo account with username GreenSky27
contained more than 700 posts and photo albums with more than 500 photographs. The account appears to be
actively maintained, with more than 300 followers and content updated as recently as November 2014.41 By piecing
together information from these sources, with the photo-rich QQ Weibo account at the core, we were able to develop
a profile of Ge Xing, the PLA Unit 78020 officer behind the username GreenSky27.

We determined GreenSky27’s true name from references on his QQ Weibo account, third-party website
corroboration, and advertisements he posted in Kunming for model airplane parts and mountain bike sales. First,
GreenSky27 obliquely reveals his surname through a photo album of his visit to the Ge family’s ancestral memorial
hall on November 23, 2013. Second, the account screen name which appears at the top of GreenSky27’s QQ Weibo
profile is Xing Xing (星星, meaning “stars”). While users are not obligated to use a real name when registering for an
account, the use of this name suggests GreenSky27’s real name may be similar.

Figure 20: Google search for GreenSky27’s QQ account number, 42113496, in combination with the surname “Ge.”

A third-party website specializing in identifying the true names of QQ account holders indicates the full name of
the GreenSky27 account holder is Ge Xing (葛星). Searches for GreenSky27’s QQ account number, 42113496, in
combination with the surname “Ge,” return a link to the website qun.594sgk.com/qq/15689281.html, which reports
Ge Xing as the owner of the account.

GREENSKY27, located in Yunnan Province, posted a series of advertisements for model aircraft components at
the 5IRC.com remote control model forums. One posting included additional contact information, including the QQ
address 42113496 and a phone number 13608871463.42
Searches for this QQ address and the aforementioned phone number revealed a 2014 post in a local forum
for Lincang Township, a suburb of Kunming, advertising a mountain bike for sale with the point of contact
“Mr. Ge” (葛先生).43 This post was no longer accessible, but an image of a mountain bike in the advertisement could
still be accessed via a cache of Google Images.44 The bike depicted in Mr. Ge’s sales advertisement is located in the
same room in which other mountain bikes are shown in photos on GreenSky27’s QQ Weibo page (see Figure 21),
corroborating GreenSky27’s surname to be Ge.

another mountain bike located in the same room (right).

Finally, the surname Ge is again connected to the GreenSky27 QQ Weibo account by a 2012 post on Baidu Tieba,
in which GreenSky27 announces the birth of his child. The November 21, 2012 post, from Baidu Tieba account
“greensky27,” states: “A [child], surnamed Ge, born November 20, 2012, at 11:36PM: seeking recommendations for
a three-character name.”45

Confirming the Location: Ge Xing is in Kunming
The advertisements described above place Ge Xing in Kunming. Although his QQ Weibo account lists his physical
address as Ireland, numerous images uploaded to this account, including his license plate, geolocated bike routes,
and photographs of landmarks in Kunming, place Ge Xing in Kunming.

YUNNAN LICENSE PLATE
The license plate attached to Ge Xing’s car, a Volkswagen Golf, indicates a Yunnan Province (云南省) registration. The
following photo is representative of several pictures depicting the vehicle and rear plate. The Chinese character on

GEOLOCATION THROUGHOUT KUNMING
GPS-traced bike routes shared by Ge Xing on his QQ Weibo profile indicate paths through Kunming. These routes
likely were recorded using either a smartwatch or mobile phone application. The following figure shows one of these
shared bike routes through the Wuhua District in Central Kunming.

In addition to these bike routes, on one occasion GreenSky27 also used the geolocating application SOSO Map
Share (SOSO地图分享) to broadcast his location within Kunming. The image below places GreenSky27 at an address
north of Jiaochang West Road, and west of Jiaochang Middle Road, with the caption “Kunming School of Public
Health (昆明市卫生学校) (Jiaochang Campus), Yunnan Province, Kunming, Wuhua District, Jiaochang West Road,
No. 6.” This location is close to the northern terminus of the bike route through the Wuhua District shown above.

The dates of these photos range from 2012 through 2014, reflecting GreenSky27’s ongoing residence in the city.
On January 2, 2013, Ge also posted photos that he captioned “beloved party
school” (亲爱的党校). Kunming’s communist party school (中共昆明市委党校) has
multiple campuses, and it is likely Ge had to take a short course at a political
academic institution like this one to fulfill a PLA political requirement.

GREENSKY27’S PHYSICAL ADDRESS
GreenSky27’s physical address is not on his QQ Weibo profile, but an account with username greensky27 and user
number 7668760 at the Kunming Mothers Network social networking website (昆明妈妈网) indicates the account
holder’s street address is Lotus Street Neighborhood, Wuhua District, Kunming, Yunnan Province (云南省 昆明市 五
华区 莲华街道).46
It is likely the Kunming Mothers Network greensky27 is the same individual as QQ Weibo GreenSky27. Both profiles
indicate residency in Kunming. The Kunming Mothers Network account was created in the “newborn infants” section
of the website in 2012, and the photographs of GreenSky27’s newborn child posted to his QQ Weibo account
indicate GreenSky27’s child was born the same year. The Baidu Tieba birth announcement for GreenSky27’s child
likewise was posted in November 2012.
Moreover, the Lotus Street Neighborhood address given by the Kunming Mothers Network account is consistent with
location information in the GreenSky27 QQ Weibo account. The image above placing GreenSky27 at the Kunming
School of Public Health indicates Lotus Street Neighborhood on the right-hand side of the image, to the east of

Ge Xing’s Background and Ties to Unit 78020
Ge Xing’s longstanding ties to the PLA are apparent from substantial evidence on his GreenSky27 QQ Weibo page
and documents available on Chinese-language websites. He launched his career as a PLA officer by attending the
PLA International Studies University in 1998. Academic papers written by Ge Xing as a graduate student specifically
place him at the Kunming TRB in 2008. Photos from his GreenSky27 QQ Weibo account from 2011 to 2014 place
him at the Kunming TRB headquarters compound, underscoring his ongoing connection with the PLA.

ATTENDANCE AT PLA INTERNATIONAL STUDIES UNIVERSITY
GreenSky27’s QQ Weibo profile information states that he matriculated at the PLA International Studies University
(解放军国际关系学院) in 1998.47,48 The PLA International Studies University was established in Nanjing in 1961,
and the school has a long history of educating PLA officers in international strategy, military foreign relations, and
foreign languages.49 It operates under the General Staff Department, with graduates going on to perform intelligence
translation and reporting work, military liaison, or foreign language instruction at military academies.50 The university
also operates a branch campus in Kunming, although it is unclear whether GreenSky27 maintains any association
with this branch.

ATTENDANCE AT RECENT PLA EVENTS
Recent photos posted to GreenSky27’s QQ Weibo account demonstrate his ongoing relationship with the PLA. A
series of photos taken in 2014 shows scenes from a PLA event commemorating the 87th anniversary of the PLA in
Kunming. The event appears to be an internal PLA exercise rather than a public event, with only a limited audience

reads, “Yunnan Province celebrates 87 years of PLA Army Building.”

VISIT TO PLA INTERNATIONAL STUDIES UNIVERSITY IN 2014
GreenSky27’s ties to the PLA are reinforced by a series of photos documenting his trip to the PLA International
Studies University campus in Nanjing in 2014. The photos show exterior views of several buildings and facilities at
the campus. These images do not show any other people, possibly reflecting an impromptu visit by GreenSky27 to
his alma mater, rather than an official business tour. Two example images are shown below.

Figure 28: Ge Xing visits PLA International Studies University in 2014.

ACADEMIC PAPERS INDICATING AFFILIATION WITH UNIT 78020
Two research papers identified by searches on the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database of
academic journal articles directly link GreenSky27 to the Kunming TRB. These papers, both written in 2008, indicate
authorship by a Ge Xing (葛星), located in Kunming, affiliated with PLA Unit 78020. See Appendix F: Ge Xing’s Unit

Figure 29: Title and author information for one of the publications written by Ge Xing. The author affiliation line below the name Ge Xing (葛星) reads,
“Chinese People’s Liberation Army Unit 78020, Yunnan, Kunming, 650223” (中国人民解放军78020部队，云南，昆明，650223). The title of the
article is “Examination of Trends in Thailand’s Southern Muslim Separatist Movement.” The publication date is December 2008.

Both papers discuss politics in Thailand. One paper is entitled “Analysis of Post-War Thailand’s Political
Democratization Characteristics and Factors” and the other “Examination of Trends in Thailand’s Southern Muslim
Separatist Movement.” The author biographies attached to these papers indicate that Ge Xing was born in 1980 and
was pursuing a Master’s degree in Southeast Asian international politics at Yunnan University (云南大学) in 2008.

The name Ge Xing, the author’s residency in Kunming, and the author’s affiliation with the PLA match the information
on GreenSky27’s QQ Weibo profile. From the model aircraft forum advertisements, we know that GreenSky27 has
been located in the Kunming area since as early as 2004, so it is plausible he continued to reside there in 2008. The
1980 year of birth is also consistent with what is known about GreenSky27 from his QQ Weibo profile. It is realistic
that a person born in 1980 would enter undergraduate studies in 1998 and become a father in 2012.

PHOTOS PLACING GE XING AT KUNMING TRB HEADQUARTERS
Several of Ge Xing’s photos from his GreenSky27 QQ account indicate he has visited Kunming TRB headquarters
frequently since 2011. This section leverages Ge’s photos by corroborating them with information from Chinese
websites, street view imagery from QQ Maps, and satellite imagery from Google Earth. Based on his QQ account,
Ge Xing appears to have taken photographs from a hotel on base and three series of photos from the main building

47

Photos from Hotel 020 Parking Lot on Base
On December 16, 2013, Ge posted photos from his visit to the 020 Hotel (0二0宾馆), a guest house (招待所) for
PLA Unit 78020.51 According to Chinese websites, this guest house is located at 158 Jiaochang East Road, Wuhua
District, Kunming (云南省昆明市五华区教场东路158号), near Kunming General Hospital (25°04’23.2”N 102°42’08.9”E
25.073126, 102.702467).52 This is the same address identified by Western analysts as the headquarters building for
Unit 78020.53

Figure 31: Ge Xing’s photos of his car parked at the 020 Hotel, posted to the GreenSky27 account.

For this address, QQ Maps censors parts of the entrance and certain individuals in its Streetview. From a vantage
point farther away and zoomed in, however, the entrance’s features include a red star over the entrance and

Figure 32: QQ Streetview imagery of the security entrance to the Unit 78020 compound. The image to the left had been censored within QQ, whereas
the image to right was not.

Based on this information we can place Ge Xing in the compound at the hotel. Ge’s vantage point is the parking lot
facing towards the gate, showing a slanted wall, a reddish gate, and Chinese characters and blue rectangular panels
for the Kunming General Hospital.

Photos Taken from the Kunming TRB Main Building
Based on Ge’s QQ account, he took photos from at least three different vantage points near the Kunming TRB’s main
building, outlined in the figure above. First is a series of four photos of a tall building with a distinctive roof ornament,
taken near a basketball court. Second are photos of a parking lot from within the compound with a distinctive tower
in the background. Finally, Ge’s QQ account includes a photo of a courtyard from within the compound.
The building from which these photos appear to have been taken is not labeled in open source media, but it stands
out as the central structure within the compound. The numerous communications dishes arrayed on its rooftop are

consistent with our assessment that it is the Kunming TRB headquarters building.

50

Photos of Building with Distinctive Roof Ornament
Four images depicting a tall apartment complex topped with a distinctive roof ornament appear to have been taken
from the same location over a period spanning from November 2011 to March 2013. All four of Ge Xing’s photos appear
to have been taken and uploaded at about 8:30 AM on different dates. Regarding the vantage point, one of the images
(the first in the sequence above) depicts a basketball hoop and backboard in the foreground, part of a basketball court

Figure 35: Photos from within Unit 78020 of a tall building with a distinctive roof ornament (left). Within one image, a basketball hoop and backboard

Parking Lot and a Structure Resembling a Water Tower
Another series of photos sharing a similar vantage point appears to depict a parking lot and several nearby locations
within the Kunming TRB compound. These photos appear to have been taken between March and December 2013
from within the central building in the Kunming TRB compound. In Google Earth and on QQ Streetview, there is a

structure shaped like a water tower that matches the structure on the right side of Ge Xing’s photos.

52

Courtyard Within the Kunming TRB Compound
On September 3, 2013, Ge Xing took a photo of a courtyard, the pattern of which matches the two courtyards in the
middle of the main building for the Kunming TRB.

Figure 37: Photo from within Unit 78020’s main compound courtyard.

Ge’s affiliation with PLA Unit 78020. Online social media accounts, geolocated trips and photos, and references
to a physical address confirm Ge Xing’s identity and location in Kunming. Ge’s military, academic, and publication
background strongly hint at his PLA responsibilities, and his photos at the Kunming TRB’s main building itself provide
definitive proof of association.
We hypothesize Ge Xing is a staff officer at 78020 providing regional expertise to a team of technical personnel. He
is qualified for such a role with his apparent expertise in Thai politics, evidenced by his Master’s degree in Southeast
Asian politics and relevant publications. Ge likely has a position within at least the middle level of the PLA professional
hierarchy based on his academic credentials, 10-15 years of experience within the PLA, and his occasional travel
to Beijing, Chengdu, and Nanjing. Apart from the appearance of his screen name within Naikon’s C2 infrastructure,
there is no indication of technical training.

O

ur analysis concludes the evidence tying Ge
Xing to Unit 78020 and its Naikon APT activity

is quite strong. This section documents how Ge Xing’s
background is ideal for supporting Naikon activities and
how his personal schedule correlates with activity by
greensky27.vicp.net. To confirm the greensky27.vcip.net
domain was not the work of a freelancer, we examined the
time of day during which the domain made DNS record
changes. We also found striking correlations when we
overlaid Ge Xing’s social media postings with periods of
greensky27.vcip.net domain inactivity.

Copyright © 2015 | ThreatConnect Inc. and Defense Group Inc. (DGI)

55

The most compelling evidence of Ge Xing’s involvement with Unit 78020 and the Naikon campaigns is the correlation
between details of his personal-life events such as travel, vacation, family events, and Naikon activity. We base our
timelines of Ge’s personal life and events on his QQ photos taken across the country, as well as comments made on
those photos and other social media. Trip dates are based on the posting dates for photos Ge took in a particular
location. When Ge Xing is away from Kunming, analysis of the greensky27.vicp.net infrastructure indicates it is offline
or parked as detailed in Chapter Two. As we dive into passive and active DNS resolutions for the greensky27.vicp.net
domain over the past five years, we can identify notable resolution patterns that are consistent with events, dates,
and times Ge has posted online.
To give you a bird’s-eye view of the timeline of events in the greensky27.vcip.net domain history and Ge Xing’s
personal-life events over the last five years, we present to you Figure 38 below.

Timeline

Figure 38: Timeline of infrastructure activity and adversary-relevant events.

The red line denotes the number of times the greensky27.vcip.net domain changed IP addresses in a day. A spike on
the red line indicates the domain was extremely active, jumping around to avoid detection by IP-based filters when
carrying out its evil deeds. A glimpse of the chart gives you four distinct time periods: heavy activity from late October
2010 to July 2011, followed by a more or less dormant period until October 2011. The domain resumed high operational
tempo until June 2014, after which we see extended periods of dormancy with occasional bursts of activity.
The blue line shows the cumulative rise in number of unique IP addresses the domain has resolved to over the fiveyear period. There is a clear correlation between the red and blue lines: whenever the domain is dormant (absence
of activity on the red line), you see the blue line flattening (no rise in usage of new IP addresses) and conversely a

The vertical lines represent certain “pattern of life” events tied to Ge Xing and show a remarkable correlation with the

each of the events.

The Year of the Rabbit, the Dragon, and the Snake
The Chinese New Year is responsible for the single biggest human migration every year, with upwards of one billion
road and public-transit trips estimated within China during this period.54 Given the centrality of Chinese New Year with
its emphasis on visiting family, we would expect to see the greensky27.vcip.net domain to become inactive during
this period. The graphs below provide a zoomed-in timeline around the Chinese New Year events of 2011 (the Year
of the Rabbit), 2012 (the Dragon), and 2013 (the Snake). As expected, the domain is dormant for almost a whole
week in each of the three cases, the length of time an individual may be expected to be on leave during this event.
By July 2014, the domain remained consistently dormant, so the 2014 and 2015 Chinese New Year events showed
nothing irregular.

Of these three examples, 2012 is of particular interest. Chinese New Year was celebrated on January 23, 2012. We
saw the expected lull in activity, but it was cut short. On Friday, January 27, 2012 at 10:55 AM China Central Time,
the greensky27.vicp.net domain reactivated, making resolution changes until Thursday, February 2 and then going
inactive again over the weekend before resuming activity on Monday, February 6, 2012.
Our working hypothesis is the holiday may have been interrupted by news of the bilateral U.S.-Philippines negotiating
broader military cooperation. On January 26 and 27, 2012, Western media outlets such as the New York Times55,
Reuters56, and Time Magazine57 reported on a high-level Philippine delegation visiting Washington, D.C. The visit
was part of preliminary talks with U.S. officials aimed at strengthening military cooperation in support of the Obama
administration’s strategic “pivot” to Asia. We suspect reports of the Philippine delegation’s visit to Washington may
have interrupted New Year festivities and forced resumption of active work.
We acknowledge dormancy during the Chinese New Year holiday does not on its own prove the person behind the
this time. To further prove that out, we plotted certain events in Ge Xing’s life from his social media postings as
described in Chapter Three, which correlate closely to lulls in activity within our timeline.

Shortly after the Chinese New Year, Ge Xing visited Beijing from February 12 to 16, 2012, shown in a red
vertical band in the figure above. We suspect the visit was official business, during which we observed the
greensky27.vcip.net domain resolve to an IP address in Beijing. Of the nearly 2,500 DNS record changes in our entire
data set, less than half of one percent ever resolved into a Beijing IP address – a third of which fell within this time
period. The rarity of the domain in question resolving to Beijing combined with the corresponding visit by Ge Xing
prevents us from accepting this as mere coincidence.

threads within Baidu Tieba at roughly the same time. As we look at the resolution activity, we can clearly see an

Domain Goes Dormant During 2013 Visit to Ge Ancestral Hall
On November 23, 2013 Ge Xing visited the Ge family’s ancestral memorial hall. These images show the exterior of
a memorial hall devoted to remembrance of the Ge family’s deceased ancestors, as well as individual tablets and
inscriptions within the hall bearing the Ge family name. The figures below show several of these images accompanied
by translations. The QQ Weibo caption common to all of these photos reads, “Returning home to pay respect to the

Figure 46: Plaque and memorial within the Ge family memorial hall. The heading on the plaque at left reads, “Ge family ancestral hall epitaphs” (葛氏宗
祠碑誌). The inscription on the memorial at right reads, “Memorial to Ge family past generations and deceased parents” (葛氏歷代宗祖考妣之神位).

Infrastructure analysis of greensky27.vicp.net highlights Ge was active using infrastructure from Kunming and
Thailand for the week prior to his weekend trip to his ancestral hall on November 23, 2013. However on November
23, the greensky27.vicp.net infrastructure was inactive, parked in Seoul and Denver. Note the gap is only 28 hours,
so the infrastructure was active on both of the calendar days with a gap of 28 hours between them. The chart below
at daily resolution is not able to completely capture the inactivity, but the parking is evident by the flat line prior to
the event.

Ge posted photos on his QQ account of his road trip outside of Kunming from June 28 to July 1, 2014 and a separate
trip to Nanjing from July 21 to 22. Regarding the Nanjing trip on July 22, Ge posted, “Can only post pictures, can’t
elaborate, look for yourself.” The two trips are marked with gray bands in the figure below. During these dates, we
note “parking” resolutions to Seoul with four days of inactivity prior to June 30 with an abrupt start date on July 24

Drastic Changes in Late May 2014
Thus far, we have shown how short-term changes in the greensky27.vicp.net domain correlate with personal events
in Ge Xing’s life, documented via social media. Overall, however, the domain was active from October 2010 to May
2014 with an increasing cumulative number of unique IP addresses associated. The blue line in Figure 51 illustrates
this trend with a drastic flat-lining starting in late May 2014. This notable decline in the rate of unique IP addresses
resolved is accompanied by an overall drop in activity.

Ge Xing’s Workday
Another interesting set of observations can be made by studying the time of day during which the greensky27.vcip.net
domain made DNS record changes. One possible counterargument to our case is the person operating the domain
is a freelancer. However, the distribution of the DNS record changes shown in Figure 52 strongly suggests a normal
workday. Times are shown in China Standard Time (CST), the time zone used in Kunming. This distribution is a very
good indicator of the work hours (+0800 Kunming time) that Ge likely keeps. For example, we can see a spike of activity
around 9:00 AM with a mid-day break in activity for lunch, where Ge likely ends his day at various times in early evening
between 6:00 and 8:00 PM. The mean of the distribution falls around noon, and it would seem that a substantial portion
of the data falls inside 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM.60

Hour of Day in Chinese Standard Time (CST)
Figure 52: Total count of resolution activity by hour of day (China Standard Time) between 2010 and 2015.

Looking at time of day data for other key cities such as Bangkok, Denver, and Seoul reinforces our conclusions about
their role in the adversary’s network. As discussed earlier, Ge Xing’s academic background focused on Thailand.
Bangkok is the second-most resolved city with a high number of resolutions but low time spent resolved. The
times are concentrated during the workday and appear centered on the morning work hours. A possible scenario
is Ge arrives at work around 9:00 AM, establishes a VPN tunnel into Naikon’s operational remote C2 infrastructure,
updating his Oray Peanut Shell client manually or setting it to automatically resolve to the respective Bangkok C2 IP
address, the same geography where his targets are most likely located.

60

The unusual propensity for earlier times before 9:00 AM is due to a series of resolutions into Kunming in 2010 and 2011. During these years, Ge made very few
resolutions after 10:00 AM.

Whereas the Bangkok graph suggests collections activity, the time of day data for Denver and Seoul is consistent
with parking. The majority of Denver resolutions occurs before lunch or at closing time. Seoul has a higher number
of resolutions and a less pronounced ratio of resolutions versus time spent. It mimics the Denver graph except for
a few early-morning resolutions. Again, we see a majority of resolutions occurring before noon and at closing time,
albeit with a less extreme bias than Denver.

Conclusion

65

C

hina’s incremental yet determined march into the South China Sea is clearly underway. These overt efforts
by multiple pillars of Chinese national power are an outward manifestation of their intent to influence and

control regional interests. However, operations occurring in the shadows are equally important to what we see
conventionally. All of China’s activities in the South China Sea, whether military, diplomatic, or economic, have been
long supported by a well-resourced covert signals intelligence and digital exploitation unit that maintained deep
access within China’s Southeast Asian neighbors’ public and private sector enterprises.
China’s justification in leveraging the military grade signals intelligence Unit 78020 for these operations goes far
beyond exploiting countless enterprise networks to acquire proprietary data. Unit 78020’s network intrusions are
just a ways to a means, and the greensky27.vcip.net infrastructure analyzed in this report is just one small cog in the
machine. What is really at hand is a broader national objective of physically intruding into the 1.4 million square miles
that make up the South China Sea. It is likely that China does not view this behavior as criminal in nature, insofar as
it cannot be stealing if you already consider something to be yours. But the targets of this activity most certainly do
not share that view.
This aggressiveness clearly comes at an expense to China’s reputation regionally and internationally as credible proof
of these operations continues to mount. As this report adds its testimony to the trial, we expect – and have already
seen – a temporary cessation in greensky27.vcip.net activity and broader Naikon activities. What we do not expect to
see is any change in policy, rhetoric, or operations; China will undoubtedly continue their routine of blasé denials and
dismissals of all allegations. Such a position becomes harder to maintain, however, when one of their own – albeit
unwittingly – offers the incriminating evidence. We hope the evidences revealed in this report serve as a catalyst for
greater awareness and improved diplomacy within the South China Sea region and around the globe.

Takeaways for Intelligence Analysts
While the big picture of this report addresses regional and international affairs, our intent is to speak at a more tactical
level to the technical analysts who read it. A love of analysis is not only at the core of our DNA as a company, but has
deep personal roots as well. We enjoyed doing this analysis and hope that shows in the final product.
Our goal with this report is to demonstrate the merits of a comprehensive approach to intelligence that strongly
connects knowledge about an adversary with their capabilities, infrastructure, and target victims. In that sense, the
greensky27.vcip.net domain merely serves as a convenient example to make that case; we realize it’s only a small
shard in the tip of the Naikon iceberg. There are many public instances of single-dimensional analysis gone wrong,
and we offer the structure and rigor of pivoting around the Diamond Model for Intrusion Analysis as a counter to that.
Another takeaway for analysts, especially those newer to the field, is how a relatively small set of initial indicators can

Another takeaway for analysts, especially those newer to the field, is how
a relatively small set of initial indicators can (with the right platform and
processes) be developed into a much larger body of intelligence.
We began this analysis from a few open source reports and one domain referenced in a handful of malware samples.
And that brings up another key takeaway. The principles of science hold that useful research must be shared and
reproducible so that findings can be vetted by peers to advance the knowledge of the community. Those same
principles apply to threat research, and we commend all of you who hold to them.

Takeaways for InfoSec Professionals
This report is first and foremost an intelligence product. But that does not mean it has no relevance to those living
“in the trenches” who have the difficult job of defending enterprise networks day in and day out. Intelligence that is
never operationalized is arguably not intelligence at all.
With respect to operational defensive efforts, the aim of this analysis is to showcase possibilities enabled through a
broad collection of human and technical intelligence. As stated in Chapter Two, we see limited value in the endless
game of IP whack-a-mole. Half of all IPs tied to greensky27.vcip.net were seen only once and a quarter of them
remained active for less than an hour. A much more efficient approach lies in creating diverse sets of associated
indicators along with established tactics, techniques, and procedures and leveraging smart automation to enable
them holistically through all layers of defense.

A much more efficient approach lies in creating diverse sets of associated
indicators along with established tactics, techniques, and procedures and
leveraging smart automation to enable them holistically through all layers
of defense.
On that note, we believe defensive “layers” matter. When approaching the task of stopping badness in your network,
many potential options exist. Some are inherently more efficient than others. As one example, the ability to block an
entire domain like greensky27.vcip.net as malicious at the DNS layer is much more effective and much less effort than
endless firewall rule changes to deny thousands of associated IPs added daily from all over the world.
Unit 78020’s tactic of leveraging current regional events in combination with malicious decoy documents demonstrates
that attacks against hardware and software often target wetware first. So, it’s key to defend at the human level first
and foremost. See this as an opportunity to educate all staff to recognize and respond to suspicious activity, files, and
incidents. Knowing that they target the vulnerable user over the vulnerable asset is especially critical during periods of
increased tensions, diplomatic summits, or other events of strategic interest to potential state or state-affiliated actors.

Takeaways for Business Leaders
Last but certainly not least, we’d like to offer some parting thoughts to the executives, decision makers, and managers
who invested their time to review this report – or to those who will brief them. ;)
The inherent unfairness of the security game should be plainly obvious from the scope of this investigation. Those
who still picture the adversary as hoodie-wearing teens crouched over a computer in their mom’s basement are
doing their organizations a disservice. In many cases, as evidenced in this document, the adversary thinks well
beyond even your “long-term” strategic plan and is far better resourced than your entire organization. That is not

DNS dataset, and powerful platforms like ThreatConnect as ways to help accomplish that.

to help level the playing field. Giving them that support in combination with sufficient resources to do their job is the
most important thing you can do to minimize risk to your organization.
Related to that, understanding the complex array of industry, regional, and international dynamics at play is critical to
properly assessing that risk. We hope this report demonstrates that the likelihood of being targeted may not merely be
a function of the sensitivity of your intellectual property. There are many socioeconomic and geopolitical factors that
drive exploitation campaigns, their impact to victim organizations, and far beyond. Savvy leaders will make every effort
to understand these factors in light of their business and take steps to mitigate them as best as possible. It would be
disingenuous of us not to recommend solid threat intelligence products like DGI’s BLUE HERON, PassiveTotal’s passive

As we begin to enumerate across Naikon infrastructure using ThreatConnect active DNS fused with passive DNS

clusters of unique and common infrastructure emerge around just a subset of Naikon C2 domains.

infrastructure used by malware embedded in oil- and gas-themed decoy documents. We also observe infrastructure that
maintains unique naming conventions, such as aseanph.vicp.net, pnoc.vicp.net, pnoc-ec.vicp.net, and serch.vicp.net.

71

The naming convention applied within aseanph.vicp.net is clearly a reference to the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, while pnoc.vicp.net and pnoc-ec.vicp.net are likely impersonating the Philippine National Oil Company63
(PNOC) and its subsidiary Exploration Corporation (www.pnoc-ec.com.ph) respectively. The oil and gas infrastructure
nexus observed in connection with greensky27.vicp.net and other Unit 78020 (Naikon) infrastructure suggests
targeting patterns supportive of the PRC’s strategic interests over energy resources within the South China Sea and

ilitary region TRBs located near China’s borders are thought to support local border defense forces in addition
to their military region commands.64 In the case of the Kunming TRB, this mission would naturally engender

a regional focus on Southeast Asia. This hypothesis is supported by the topics of research papers authored by
TRB personnel (Appendix C: Summary of publications written by Unit 78020 personnel), several of which discuss
Southeast Asian politics. The Kunming TRB is one of 10 military region TRBs as listed in the below chart.

The substantive focus of Unit 78020 can be seen in part through a review of publications written by personnel affiliated
with the Unit since 2004. Several topical groupings emerge. Many recent papers focus on network security, data mining,
and wireless communications. A number of papers discuss Southeast Asian and Japanese international relations.

n Chapter Two we delved into detail covering the various patterns observed with the dynamic greensky27.vicp.
net domain. For those less familiar with this type of infrastructure, it is important to understand the purpose of a

dynamic domain, the service provider in which the domain is managed, and how the user (in this case Ge Xing) likely
manages the dynamic domain and the associated resolution records.
As we mentioned in Chapter Two, Naikon and online threat actors in general leverage and abuse benign dynamic
DNS service providers to obtain affordable means for mobility and redundancy to communicate with their malicious
code. The technique is quite simple: the adversary chooses a dynamic DNS service provider of interest and registers
for an account. The adversary will create a hostname (greensky27), binding it to one of the service providers domains
in which the dynamic DNS services are offered (vicp.net). The domain (greensky27.vicp.net) is then bound to the user
account under the adversary’s control.
The attacker will then embed the new dynamic domain (or domains) within
a malicious payload of their choice, in advance of the targeting or delivery
phase of the attack. Once the malware is deployed and a victim interacts
with it, the malicious payload calls home to the dynamic domain, resolving
and connecting to the respective C2 IP address the attacker chooses. The
attacker maintains the ability to update DNS records, pointing it to
infrastructure (IP addresses) at any time and place of their choosing. In the
case of Oray DNS records can be updated manually or managed with client
applications or embedded devices such as SOHO routers. Oray boasts
integrations with a variety of embedded hardware vendors such as D-Link,
TP-Link, ZTE, Huawei, and Cisco.66
In the use case highlighted above, Ge and the Naikon APT in general opt to
use Shanghai Best Oray Information Technology Co., Ltd. (上海贝锐信息科技
有限公司) as a dynamic domain infrastructure service provider. In fact, Naikon
even makes a casual reference to Oray within their self-registered domains
such as oraydns.googlesec.pw.67
According to its website, Oray provides online services and software
applications. Its “Peanut Shell” (花生壳) services and applications include
remote desktop control (远程监控), website and forum maintenance, VPN
services, email systems, FTP services, and office automation services.68
Users do not need to update their dynamic DNS service through a browser.

Instead, Oray offers a local client application that allows users to manage the domain and update items such as the
A record, MX record, CNAME (alias), and URL redirection.69
According to several Oray.net forum posting notifications to its free Peanut Shell dynamic domain service customers
and support forum posts, Oray uses the 174.128.255.0/24 IP address range for resolution of offline (离线) domains
where the registered user’s host or router is not logged into the dynamic domain service70. This is an example of
“provider parking” as opposed to the Seoul or non-routable resolutions, which we assess as “adversary parking.”
