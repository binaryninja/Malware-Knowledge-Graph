Mandiant Red Team Emulates FIN11 Tactics To Control
Operational Technology Servers
mandiant.com/resources/mandiant-red-team-emulates-fin11-tactics

During the last couple of years, ransomware incidents have impacted thousands of industrial
and critical infrastructure organizations. In some cases, Mandiant has observed how these
intrusions disrupt industrial production chains and operational workflows as a method to
incentivize the payment of ransoms. Although in most cases victims have suffered damages
exclusively restricted to enterprise systems, this does not mean that operational technology
(OT) systems are not at risk.
The nature of OT technology and the challenges of defending it means that many OT
networks have security gaps that even less sophisticated actors can leverage. Furthermore,
Mandiant has consistently highlighted that some financially motivated groups continue to
deploy the same or similar tools and techniques as those used by advanced persistent
threats (APTs) during high-profile cyber physical incidents.
In this blog, we describe an engagement where a Mandiant Red Team targeted a European
engineering organization to understand the potential reach ransomware operators could
have in their network. Our Red Team emulated the techniques used by FIN11, a financially
motivated threat group that has conducted long-running ransomware distribution campaigns

across multiple industries. Using FIN11’s techniques to move from a corporate endpoint with
regular employee credentials, obtain domain administrator rights, steal critical data, and gain
access to OT servers.

Ransomware Actors Have Proven Capabilities to Access OT
In 2020, Mandiant released a post describing how financial crime actors were expanding
their reach into OT. Our assessment was based upon two process kill-lists that were
deployed alongside known ransomware strains to amplify the impact of the attacks. These
lists were intended to enumerate and terminate software processes, a couple of which were
coincidentally related to OT. While there is limited documented information to determine the
impact from these process lists, our assessment indicated that by stopping such processes
the actor could have abruptly terminated and encrypted critical OT functions resulting in
added damage to the victim.
One of the two process kill lists was deployed alongside a CLOP ransomware sample, which
we then attributed to a cybercrime actor known as FIN11. The group has monetized their
operations using point-of-sale (POS) malware, CLOP ransomware, and traditional extortion.
FIN11 has shown no indication of having specialized OT expertise and there is no evidence
indicating that the process kill list they deployed resulted in significant impacts to any victim
OT environments. However, the actor’s use of a process kill list containing some OT
processes brings up further questions about the extent of their capabilities and how they
might impact OT in the future.
In the past, financially motivated actors—such as FIN11—have used tactics, techniques and
procedures (TTPs) that are comparable to those used by state-sponsored actors to support
the early stages of the OT targeted attack lifecycle. This includes using publicly available
tooling, living –off-the-land techniques, known exploitation frameworks, and tailored malware
to compromise victims.
Figure 1 illustrates some overlaps in techniques used during the TRITON and
INDUSTROYER incidents with techniques used by FIN11 and another cybercrime actor,
FIN6 for ransomware deployment and extortion and retail card theft.

Figure 1: TTP overlaps among state-sponsored and financially motivated actors
The overlaps in TTPs across the four cases likely exist because reaching target assets—
both in IT and OT—often requires an actor to follow a process of lateral movement and
escalation of privileges across corporate and/or production networks. As ransomware
operators have significantly evolved over the past couple of years, the main difference that
remains is that some state-sponsored actors have also invested significant resources to
develop OT-tailored payloads to disrupt physical processes.

Mandiant Red Team Used FIN11 Techniques to Move Across a Target's
Enterprise Network and Reach OT Servers
The MandiantRed Team supported a European engineering organization to visualize the
possible impact of a financially motivated actor deploying ransomware in their environment.
The engagement pursued three goals, all of which were successfully accomplished:
Emulate a ransomware attacker in the IT environment
Propagate from IT to separate OT network segments
Emulate multi-faceted extortion by accessing confidential information to steal and
redistribute
Figure 2 illustrates the two paths Mandiant pursued to reach OT targets:

Figure 2: Red Team attack path using FIN11 techniques
For this engagement, Mandiant adopted an "assumed breach" approach, starting from a
standard employee account and device on the target's enterprise domain. Mandiant then
utilized commonly seen FIN11 techniques to continue the intrusion moving across endpoints
in different security zones (see the Appendix). Some of the techniques we used to achieve
our objectives in IT and OT included:
Reconnaissance of web and internal applications
Mandiant discovered several documents that contained cleartext credentials,
information on IT architecture, network information, and other confidential data on
internal shares and knowledge sharing web applications and wikis.
Reconnaissance of Active Directory infrastructure
Mandiant used a variation of the public tool BloodHound to gather user, group,
group policy objects (GPO), and machine information to build up data structures
that describe the target's Active Directory (AD) infrastructure. Mandiant then
encrypted and exfiltrated this information to track compromised users and
strategize the next steps for the attack.
Privilege escalation through CVE-2021-36934, aka "SeriousSAM"
Mandiant discovered a number of devices vulnerable to CVE-2021-36934.
Exploiting this vulnerability, Mandiant downloaded the Security Account Manager
(SAM) databases of these devices and utilized the Impacket library to extract
secrets from it, including the password hashes for local accounts, computer
account passwords, and cached domain credentials.

Lateral movement through silver ticket
Mandiant forged Silver tickets – Kerberos Ticket Granting Service (TGS) tickets
necessary for user authentication – using the ticketer.py script from the Impacket
library. This enabled the Red Team to impersonate any user on the victim service
(including administrative accounts) to escalate privileges on specific endpoints in
the IT network.
Privilege escalation through Active Directory Certificate Services abuse
Mandiant discovered that the target's AD Certificate Services (CS) configuration
contained at least one misconfiguration in a Certificate Template, which allowed
the requesting entity to request certificates for other principals in the target's AD
domains. Mandiant enumerated the AD CS configuration using the public Certify
tool.

Pivoting to OT on Multiple Fronts
Using the information and privileges gathered through the enterprise network compromises,
Mandiant identified the best paths to reach the target OT servers. Mandiant focused on
reaching two different specific targets: an isolated legacy OT network and a global OT
network with connections across different regions.
OT Compromise #1 – Establish Foothold and Privilege Escalation in Legacy OT Network

Figure 3: Red Team attack path for OT Compromise #1
Mandiant used the same credentials and documentation acquired during initial phases in the
corporate network to gain access to remote management software installed on a host with
access to the OT network. Mandiant then enumerated the host's network defenses and
observed that it did not utilize SSL/TLS inspection, which allowed the Red Team to launch an
implant that utilized domain fronting as a means for command and control (C&C).

5/13

Further network enumeration uncovered that the account accessed via the remote
management software also had administrative privileges on other hosts in the OT network.
Mandiant used the remote desktop protocol (RDP) to access multiple hosts, enumerate their
defenses, and upload a custom crafted C&C implant payload via Server Message Block
(SMB) protocol and RDP. Mandiant then executed these payloads via remote service
creation, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) command execution, and manual
execution. Given that these protocols and services were also being utilized by legitimate
users, it is unlikely that such activity would raise any alerts, making the lateral movement
blend into background traffic and decreasing the likelihood of discovery by network sensors.
In total, Mandiant accessed eight servers within the OT network, one of which was a Human
Machine Interface (HMI). Access to this system would allow an attacker to maliciously
interact with the physical control process using native commands. Once Mandiant
established a foothold and had administrative access, the focus shifted to privilege
escalation.
Mandiant dumped the SAM database on one of the hosts to retrieve local account
password hashes, which we cracked using a dictionary attack. This revealed the
cleartext password for one of the local administrator accounts.
Utilizing local administrator credentials Mandiant created a memory dump of the Local
Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process on another OT host using the
Task Manager application.
Mandiant exfiltrated a memory dump file and retrieved the contained credentials using
a specifically packed version of the public tool Mimikatz. The recovered credentials
contained the NTLM hash for a Domain Administrator account on the OT network
domain.
Mandiant then completed the objective by utilizing the Domain Administrator account
password hash and executing our custom payload on the OT domain controller via
remote service creation.
OT Compromise #2: Move Laterally from IT to Global OT Network

6/13

Figure 4: Red Team attack path for OT Compromise #2
For the second attack path, Mandiant escalated privileges within the target's enterprise
domain with an "AS-REP roast" attack using the Impacket library to recover multiple user
account password hashes. Mandiant cracked password hashes using a dictionary attack,
which revealed the cleartext password for one of the accounts. The user account and
credentials had RDP privileges onto an additional host, allowing Mandiant to move laterally
within the enterprise environment.
The accessed host contained engineering software, which indicated it was likely a jumphost
or an application server for engineers. Additionally, the engineering application installed on
the host used shortcuts on the desktop that pointed to batch (BAT) files in a directory
writeable by non-privileged users. This allowed Mandiant to alter the content of the BAT files
to launch unauthorized applications when users clicked the shortcut on the desktop.
Multiple users fell victim to this attack. One of these users was a member of several AD
groups and had RDP privileges to various OT jump hosts. Mandiant used the Rubeus tool to
extract the user's Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) from an active session on the
compromised host. This allowed Mandiant to import the TGT on a system that was already
controlled by the Red Team and then request a TGS for the "TERMSRV/<HOST>" service,
which can be used to connect via RDP to a target host using Remote Credential Guard or
Restricted Admin Mode. Finally, Mandiant launched the Remote Desktop session via the
"mstsc /remoteGuard" command to connect to several OT jumphosts via RDP.

7/13

To complete the objective, Mandiant again used credentials acquired during the
reconnaissance phase to authenticate to an OT server from one of the OT jumphosts. The
OT server ran a client/server-based SCADA software solution which was fully accessible and
already active on the machine; however due to operational impact concerns, the Red Team
refrained from interacting with the application. Access to this type of software could
potentially allow an attacker to perform in-depth reconnaissance of the OT environment,
exfiltrate sensitive information, deploy additional payloads (e.g., ransomware), or even
degrade the victim's ability to monitor or control the process.

Ransomware Attack Emulation Provides Critical Insight on Defensive
Capabilities
OT systems are critical for organizations to automate production processes. As a result, they
are attractive targets for actors intending to disrupt production either for profit or to produce
physical damage. The overlaps in TTPs between ransomware operators and OT-focused
APTs suggest that protecting against ransomware operations also yields significant defenses
against other impactful events, such as a cyber physical attack.
As of mid-2022 we have not observed financially motivated actors explicitly targeting OT
networks to extort victims, however we highlight that actors have carried out ransomware
attacks that impacted OT processes. Actors with access to OT assets may be empowered to
disrupt the victim's control or visibility over a process in several ways. OT asset owners and
operators benefit from ransomware attack emulation by confronting the latest adversary
TTPs, identifying vulnerabilities in their environment and improving breach detection and
response capabilities.
