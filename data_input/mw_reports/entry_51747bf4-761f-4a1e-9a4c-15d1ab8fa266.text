April 15, 2021
WASHINGTON — Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury took multiple sanctions
actions under a new Executive Order (E.O.) targeting aggressive and harmful activities by
the Government of the Russian Federation. Treasury’s actions include the implementation of
new prohibitions on certain dealings in Russian sovereign debt, as well as targeted sanctions
on technology companies that support the Russian Intelligence Services’ efforts to carry out
malicious cyber activities against the United States.
“The President signed this sweeping new authority to confront Russia’s continued and
growing malign behavior,” said Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen. “Treasury is leveraging
this new authority to impose costs on the Russian government for its unacceptable conduct,
including by limiting Russia’s ability to finance its activities and by targeting Russia’s
malicious and disruptive cyber capabilities.”

NEW AUTHORITY IN RESPONSE TO RUSSIAN MALIGN ACTIVITIES
The E.O. of April 15, 2021, “Blocking Property with Respect to Specified Harmful Foreign
Activities of the Government of the Russian Federation,” elevates the U.S. government’s
capacity to deploy strategic and economically impactful sanctions to deter and respond to
Russia’s destabilizing behavior. In particular, this new E.O. authorizes sanctions to counter

Russia’s harmful foreign activities that threaten the national security and foreign policy of the
United States, including: undermining the conduct of free and fair elections and democratic
institutions in the United States and its allies and partners; engaging in and facilitating
malicious cyber activities against the United States and its allies and partners that threaten
the free flow of information; fostering and using transnational corruption to influence foreign
governments; pursuing extraterritorial activities targeting dissidents or journalists;
undermining security in countries and regions important to the United States’ national
security; and violating well-established principles of international law, including respect for
the territorial integrity of states. To address these threats, the E.O. of April 15, 2021
authorizes sanctions on a wide range of persons, including, among others, those operating in
the technology and defense and related materiel sectors of the Russian Federation
economy, and in any additional sectors of the Russian Federation economy as may be
determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State.

SOVEREIGN DEBT PROHIBITIONS
Pursuant to the E.O. of April 15, 2021, Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is
issuing a directive that generally prohibits U.S. financial institutions from participating in the
primary market for ruble or non-ruble denominated bonds issued after June 14, 2021 by the
Central Bank of the Russian Federation, the National Wealth Fund of the Russian
Federation, or the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, and further prohibits U.S.
financial institutions from lending ruble or non-ruble denominated funds to these three
entities. This directive expands upon existing prohibitions on certain dealings in Russian
sovereign debt that have been in place since August 2019.

TREASURY DESIGNATES RUSSIAN COMPANIES IN THE TECHNOLOGY
SECTOR SUPPORTING RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES
Treasury’s first use of the E.O. of April 15, 2021 targets companies operating in the
technology sector of the Russian Federation economy that support Russian Intelligence
Services. The following companies are designated for operating in the technology sector of
the Russian Federation economy: ERA Technopolis; Pasit, AO (Pasit); Federal State
Autonomous Scientific Establishment Scientific Research Institute Specialized
Security Computing Devices and Automation (SVA); Neobit, OOO (Neobit); Advanced
System Technology, AO (AST); and Pozitiv Teknolodzhiz, AO (Positive Technologies).
ERA Technopolis is a research center and technology park funded and operated by the
Russian Ministry of Defense. ERA Technopolis houses and supports units of Russia’s Main
Intelligence Directorate (GRU) responsible for offensive cyber and information operations
and leverages the personnel and expertise of the Russian technology sector to develop

13694, as amended by E.O. 13757, WMD-related E.O. 13382, and the Countering America’s

SANCTIONS TARGET RUSSIAN MALICIOUS CYBER ACTORS
The Russian Intelligence Services — specifically the Federal Security Service (FSB),
Russia’s Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), and the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) —
have executed some of the most dangerous and disruptive cyber attacks in recent history,
including the SolarWinds cyber attack. The FSB and GRU were previously sanctioned in
2016, and again in 2018, for malicious cyber activity, and most recently on March 2, 2021 for
activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD).
The FSB was involved in the August 2020 poisoning of Aleksey Navalny with a chemical
weapon, specifically a nerve agent known as Novichok. The GRU also engaged in activities
that materially contributed to the possession, transportation, and use of Novichok related to a
March 2018 poisoning in the United Kingdom.
The FSB has also used its cyber capabilities to target Russian journalists and others who
openly criticize the regime, as well as U.S. government personnel and millions of private
citizens around the world. To bolster its malicious cyber operations, the FSB cultivates and

3/5

co-opts criminal hackers, including the previously designated Evil Corp, enabling them to
engage in disruptive ransomware attacks and phishing campaigns.
The GRU’s malign cyber activities include deployment of the NotPetya and Olympic
Destroyer malware; intrusions targeting the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons and the World Anti-Doping Agency; cyber attacks on government systems and
critical infrastructure in Ukraine and the state of Georgia; and hack-and-leak operations
targeting elections in the United States and France.
In addition, the Russian Intelligence Services’ third arm, the SVR, is responsible for the 2020
exploit of the SolarWinds Orion platform and other information technology infrastructures.
This intrusion compromised thousands of U.S. government and private sector networks.
The scope and scale of this compromise combined with Russia’s history of carrying out
reckless and disruptive cyber operations makes it a national security concern. The SVR has
put at risk the global technology supply chain by allowing malware to be installed on the
machines of tens of thousands of SolarWinds’ customers. Victims of the compromise include
the financial sector, critical infrastructure, government networks, and many others. Further,
this incident will cost businesses and consumers in the United States and worldwide millions
of dollars to fully address.
Additionally, the SVR stole “red team tools,” which mimic cyber attacks to help customers
better protect themselves, from a U.S. cyber security company. These tools, if made public
or used offensively by the SVR or other actors, would create additional opportunities for
malign actors to target computer systems worldwide.
The private and state-owned companies designated today enable the Russian Intelligence
Services’ cyber activities. These companies provide a range of services to the FSB, GRU,
and SVR, ranging from providing expertise, to developing tools and infrastructure, to
facilitating malicious cyber activities.

SANCTIONS IMPLICATIONS
As a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property of the designated persons
described above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons
are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly
or indirectly, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless
authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC’s regulations
generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States
that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons.
The prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or
services by, to, or for the benefit of any blocked person or the receipt of any contribution or
provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.
