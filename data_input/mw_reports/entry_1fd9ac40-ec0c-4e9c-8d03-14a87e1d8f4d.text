The Aurora Ransomware is a Windows infection that encrypts your files and then demands
a ransom in bitcoins in order to get the decryption key. This ransomware has had numerous
variants released with the most active current one being the one that appends the
.Nano extension.
The Aurora Ransomware family is spread by attackers hacking into computers running
Remote Desktop Services. Once they gain access to a computer, they install the
ransomware and encrypt any files that they gain access to. Once files are encrypted they
will have an extension appended to the file names and a ransom note will be created on the
Windows desktop and in various folders on the computer.

Encrypted .Nano Files
The good news is that the variants of this ransomware family can be decrypted for free
using a decryptor created by Michael Gillespie. In order to use the decryptor a victim just
needs to have two encrypted files of a certain file type, which will be described later in the
guide.
The currently supported variants are the ones that append the following extensions to the
names of encrypted files.
.Nano
.animus
.Aurora
.desu
.ONI
.aurora

To learn how to decrypt files encrypted by the Aurora Ransomware, please use the guide
below.

How to Decrypt the Aurora Ransomware
Victims of the Aurora Ransomware can be identified by having their files encrypted and
renamed to have a .Nano, .animus, .Aurora, .desu, .ONI, or .aurora extension.
To decrypt files encrypted by the Aurora ransomware, you need to first download the Aurora
Decryptor below.

In order to brute force the decryption key, we need two encrypted files of a certain file types.
The supported file types are:
.png, .gif, .pdf, .docx, .xlsx, .pptx, .doc, .xls, .ppt, .vsd, .psd, .mp3, .wmv,
.zip, .rar, .pst, .rtf, .mdb, .ico, .lnk, .fdb, .jar, and .idx

Once you have located two of one of the above file types, click on the Settings menu and
select Bruteforcer. This will open a screen where you should select two encrypted files as
illustrated below.

Once you have selected both files, click on the Start button to begin brute forcing the
decryption key. This process can take quite a while, so please be patient.

Bruteforcing Key

When finished, the decryptor will state that a decryption key has been found.

Now click the X button to close the BruteForcer window and the key will be loaded into the
decryptor as shown below.

Key Loaded
We now need to select a directory to decrypt by clicking on the Select Directory button. If
you wish to decrypt an entire drive, simply select the drive letter itself. For example, in the
image below you can see that we selected the C:\ drive.

Drive

Selected
When ready, click on the Decrypt button to begin decrypting the Aurora Ransomware
encrypted files. Once you click Decrypt, the program will decrypt all the encrypted files and
display the decryption status in the window. This is illustrated below where you see files
encrypted by the Nano variant of Aurora being decrypted.

Aurora Encrypted Files
When it has finished, the decryptor will display a summary of the amount of files that have
been decrypted. If some of the files were skipped it may be due to permissions to the files.

Decryption

Finished
Though your files are now decrypted, the original encrypted files will still be on your
computer. Once you confirm that your files have been properly decrypted, you can use
CryptoSearch to move all the encrypted files into one folder so you can delete or archive
them.
You can now close the decryptor and use your computer as normal. If you need help using
this decryptor, feel free to leave a comment.

Great news and article Lawrence! This once again lends credence to what I've always
maintained about Ransomware. Backups should always be kept because one should
never say never and assume their files are lost to these criminals.
