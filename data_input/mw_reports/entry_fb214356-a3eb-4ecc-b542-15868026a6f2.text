Luna Moth: The Actors Behind the Recent False
Subscription Scams
blog.sygnia.co/luna-moth-false-subscription-scams

Over the last few months, Sygnia’s Incident Response team has been methodically tracking
the 'Luna Moth' ransom group. Their modus-operandi resembles scammers, with the twist of
corporate data theft, leveraging the threat of publication to demand millions of dollars in
ransom.

key points
The Sygnia Incident Response team identified a relatively new threat group, which has
been operating since the end of March 2022. Sygnia refers to this threat actor as 'Luna
Moth' or TG2729.
'Luna Moth' focuses on Data Breach extortion attacks, threatening to leak stolen
information if the demanded ransom is not paid.
The initial compromise is achieved by deceiving victims in a phishing campaign under
the theme of Zoho MasterClass and Duolingo subscriptions, leading to the installation
of an initial tool on the compromised host.
The group uses commercial remote administration tools (RATs) and publicly available
tools to operate on compromised devices and maintain persistency, demonstrating
once more the simplicity and effectiveness of ransom attacks.
The group acts and operates in an opportunistic way: even if there are no assets or
devices to compromise in the network, they exfiltrate any data that is accessible; this
emphasizes the importance of managing sensitive corporate information.

the 'luna moth' group
With the rise in ransomware activity over the past years, the security industry has become
used to hearing about double extortion, and even triple extortion attacks, and new crime
groups of all kinds. In this blog post, we shed light on a relatively new threat actor which
goes by the name of the ‘Silent Ransom Group’ (or ‘SRG’) and was dubbed 'Luna Moth' by
Sygnia. By launching a phishing campaign with a wide coverage area, 'Luna Moth' infiltrates
and compromises victim devices. These attacks can be categorized as data breach ransom
attacks, in which the main focus of the group is to gain access to sensitive documents and
information, and demand payment to withhold publication of the stolen data. Simple as they
may be, these attacks can create serious issues for victims if sensitive data and information
is stolen in this way.
Although the group is not widely known, they have been active in the past months,
attempting to build their reputation as a ransom gang. Their modus-operandi resembles
scammers, with the twist of corporate data theft, leveraging the threat of publication to
demand millions of dollars in ransom.

gaining initial accesss
Over the past three months, the ‘Luna Moth' group operated a large-scale phishing campaign
under the theme of MasterClass and Duolingo subscriptions, by impersonating Zoho
MasterClass Inc and Duolingo. Although claiming to be related to the Zoho Corporation or
Duolingo, the phishing emails are sent from Gmail addresses that are altered to resemble
the legitimate company email addresses:
{FIRST-NAME}.{LAST-NAME}.zohomasterclass@gmail.com
{FIRST-NAME}.{LAST-NAME}.duolingo@gmail.com
This is a classic phishing scam: the email claims that the recipient of the email purchased a
subscription to a legitimate service, and that payment is due. To complete the scam, an
invoice PDF file is attached to the email, and the victim is recommended to call a phone
number, which the email states can be found within the attached file, if there are any issues
with the subscription.

If the victim wishes to refute the purchase, they are required to join a Zoho remote support
session. At this point, the threat actor uses the native Zoho Assist functionality to send
another email, entitled “Zoho Assist - Remote Support session”, which guides the user to

download and install the Zoho Assist application. The group then invites the victim to the
support session using Zoho Assist accounts that are tied to protonmail emails.
During this short yet effective Zoho Assist session, the threat actor is able to trick the user
into downloading and installing Atera on their device; this is a remote administration tool
commonly used by threat actors. Once Atera is installed on the device, the threat actor can
access the device and operate freely.

tools in the arsenal
The examples shown above demonstrate that both the activities and the toolset of 'Luna
Moth' are fairly unsophisticated. The main tools used by the threat actor consist of remote
administration tools (RATs) that allow them to control compromised devices; these include
Atera, Splashtop, Syncro, and AnyDesk. These tools also provide the threat actors with
some redundancy and persistence: if one of the RATs is removed from the system, it can be
reinstalled by the others.
Additional tools used by the group include off-the-shelf tools such as SoftPerfect Network
Scanner, SharpShares, and
Rclone. The tools are stored on compromised machines under false names masquerading
as legitimate binaries. These tools, in addition to the RATs, provide the threat actors with the
means to conduct basic reconnaissance activities, access additional available assets, and
exfiltrate data from compromised networks.

campaign infrastructure
The infrastructure used by 'Luna Moth' as part of the subscription scams can be mapped to
two main clusters of domains and IPs:
Exfiltration domains: Domains under the XYZ TLD, such as maaays[.]xyz. These
domains are used by the group as part of the Rclone exfiltration process; the domains
are the target to which the exfiltrated data is sent.
Phishing domains that appear to be related to Zoho or Duolingo – for example,
masterzohoclass[.]com. Most of these domains have a very short lifespan of about four
hours.

5/12

The first identified domain related to the campaign was registered during April 2022. Both the
exfiltration and phishing domains are hosted by the provider Hostwinds, and registered under
Namecheap.
