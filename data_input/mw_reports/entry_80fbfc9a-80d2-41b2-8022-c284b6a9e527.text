Earlier today, Motherboard published a story by Kim Zetter on Operation ShadowHammer, a
newly discovered supply chain attack that leveraged ASUS Live Update software.
While the investigation is still in progress and full results and technical paper will be published
during SAS 2019 conference in Singapore, we would like to share some important details about
the attack.
In January 2019, we discovered a sophisticated supply chain attack involving the ASUS Live
Update Utility. The attack took place between June and November 2018 and according to our
telemetry, it affected a large number of users.
ASUS Live Update is an utility that is pre-installed on most ASUS computers and is used to
automatically update certain components such as BIOS, UEFI, drivers and applications. According
to Gartner, ASUS is the world’s 5th-largest PC vendor by 2017 unit sales. This makes it an
extremely attractive target for APT groups that might want to take advantage of their userbase.
Based on our statistics, over 57,000 Kaspersky users have downloaded and installed the
backdoored version of ASUS Live Update at some point in time. We are not able to calculate
the total count of affected users based only on our data; however, we estimate that the real scale
of the problem is much bigger and is possibly affecting over a million users worldwide.
The goal of the attack was to surgically target an unknown pool of users, which were
identified by their network adapters’ MAC addresses. To achieve this, the attackers had
hardcoded a list of MAC addresses in the trojanized samples and this list was used to identify the
actual intended targets of this massive operation. We were able to extract more than 600 unique
MAC addresses from over 200 samples used in this attack. Of course, there might be other
samples out there with different MAC addresses in their list.
We believe this to be a very sophisticated supply chain attack, which matches or even surpasses
the Shadowpad and the CCleaner incidents in complexity and techniques. The reason that it
stayed undetected for so long is partly due to the fact that the trojanized updaters were signed
with legitimate certificates (eg: “ASUSTeK Computer Inc.”). The malicious updaters were hosted on
the official liveupdate01s.asus[.]com and liveupdate01.asus[.]com ASUS update servers.

We have contacted ASUS and informed them about the attack on Jan 31, 2019, supporting their
investigation with IOCs and descriptions of the malware.
Although precise attribution is not available at the moment, certain evidence we have collected
allows us to link this attack to the ShadowPad incident from 2017. The actor behind the
ShadowPad incident has been publicly identified by Microsoft in court documents as BARIUM.
BARIUM is an APT actor known to be using the Winnti backdoor. Recently, our colleagues from
ESET wrote about another supply chain attack in which BARIUM was also involved, that we believe
is connected to this case as well.

It should be noted that the numbers are also highly influenced by the distribution of Kaspersky
users around the world. In principle, the distribution of victims should match the distribution of
ASUS users around the world.
We’ve also created a tool which can be run to determine if your computer has been one of the
surgically selected targets of this attack. To check this, it compares MAC addresses of all adapters
to a list of predefined values hardcoded in the malware and alerts if a match was found.
