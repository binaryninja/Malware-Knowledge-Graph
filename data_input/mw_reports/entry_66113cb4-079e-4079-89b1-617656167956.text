A German intelligence service is warning against ongoing attacks by a China-backed
hacking group. The group, identified as APT27, has been targeting commercial
organizations in Germany.

HyperBro is the tool
According to German intelligence agency BfV, the attackers are using HyperBro RAT to
backdoor targeted networks.
The RAT acts as an in-memory backdoor with remote administration capabilities.
The goal of the campaign seems to be stealing sensitive information and targeting
victims' customers in supply chain attacks.
Further, they may attempt to infiltrate the networks of corporate customers.

Moreover, the intelligence agency has published IOCs and YARA rules to help targeted
German organizations check for infections.

Understanding APT27 campaigns
Experts revealed that APT27 has been exploiting flaws in Zoho AdSelf Service Plus
software since March 2021.
From March until mid-September, the APT group used an ADSelfService zero-day
exploit (CVE-2021-40539), and then switched to exploited an n-day AdSelfService
exploit before finally jumping to ServiceDesk flaw (CVE-2021-44077) 25 October
onward.
As per Palo Alto, the APT group had exploited ManageEngine flaws to deliver web
shells on critical infrastructure organizations and associated with attacks abusing
critical ProxyLogon bugs in March 2021.
The Palo Alto Networks also noted that APT27 compromised nine organizations from
critical sectors around the world, such as healthcare, energy, defense, education, and
technology.

While no connection was formed between the RAT and the previous campaigns as of now,
more information is awaited.

Closing thoughts
The recent warning should be considered serious and targeted organizations are suggested
to be prepared with countermeasures. Targeted entities should protect their intellectual
information with robust encryption and access systems. Further, make use of provided IOCs
and YARA rules for better detection.
