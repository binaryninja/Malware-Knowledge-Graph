Cobalt—a new trend or an old “friend”?
Information about the so-called Cobalt group appeared quite recently, in a November 2016
report1 from Group-IB. According to the report, Cobalt is associated with the previously known
Buhtrap2 campaign. Buhtrap is thought to have stolen around USD 28.5 million from Russian
bank accounts in 2015 and 2016. It is suspected that either part of that group switched over to
Cobalt, or that most of the Buhtrap creators redirected their efforts at ATMs.
At the same time, in the fall of 2016, Positive Technologies was independently investigating
an incident at a bank in Eastern Europe. The bank had experienced phishing mailings as well
as compromise of internal network resources and its ATM network. All the evidence indicated
that the attack was targeted. Artifacts indicated the involvement of the same organized crime
group that, according to Positive Technologies information, from August to October had performed similar successful attacks in Eastern Europe, and it’s likely that this group may will soon
become active in the West. Analysis confirmed that the Cobalt group was responsible.
This report includes the most important results of the investigation, including an example
of a real-life advanced persistent threat (APT) attack that could occur at any bank. To implement the attack, the criminal group used easily available software to target some of the most
common shortcomings and vulnerabilities in corporate systems, in which regard the financial
sector is no exception (see the Positive Technologies report at www.ptsecurity.com/upload/
iblock/2fe/corporate_vulnerability_2016_eng.pdf.
According to Group-IB, Buhtrap is the first criminal group to use a network worm to infect the
entire infrastructure of a bank. The main vector for penetrating the bank’s corporate network
consisted of phishing messages, which claimed to be from the Bank of Russia or its representatives. Malware was planted in a number of attacks via exploits, notably including the
infrastructure of the Metel3 group.
Eastern European banks
under threat
Who’s the next target?

A trend has been seen in 2016 towards the use of publicly available software, legitimate penetration testing software, and standard operating system (OS) functions by attackers. One instructive example is the 2016 attacks by the Carbanak4 group in Eastern Europe. This group
used similar tools, in addition to Metasploit. The same group is suspected in the recent hacking of PoS vendor Oracle MICROS5 and attacks on international banks recently reported by
Symantec6.
By underestimating the abilities of cybercriminals, and assuming that attacks always happen
to somebody else, companies fatally undermine their cybersecurity efforts. This can result in
substantial financial losses.
Despite the wealth of information now known about methods, tools used, and indicators of
compromise, the cybercriminals continue their attacks and are looking for new ways of monetizing their efforts. Targeted attacks on banks, retailers, and financial institutions around the
world are covered with increasing regularity in the media. Total losses related to such cybercrime, according to various estimates, run in the hundreds of millions of dollars. In 2017, we
expect to see an increase both in the number of attacks and in related financial losses by
banks—it would seem that the criminals are hitting their stride, while banks have barely even
begun to play catch-up.

Opening an ATM from the inside out
In early October 2016, Positive Technologies learned from a bank in Eastern Europe of a security incident that resulted in funds being stolen from bank ATMs.
Total funds stolen, in the course of one night from six ATMs, were the equivalent of approximately $35,000 in local currency. Rapid response by the bank and law enforcement prevented
the losses from growing. Theoretically, had the attackers continued for a longer period, they
could have stolen the equivalent of over $156,000 over several days, with the amount limited
only by the dispensing capabilities of the machines and number of compromised devices.
Individuals acting as cut-outs (“drops”) obtained cash from ATMs. One of these drops, a citizen of Moldova, was arrested by local law enforcement in the process of withdrawing money.
These drops are used by criminal groups to minimize the risk to core group members. Drops
do not know any of the core group members and work only with handlers, who are responsible for gathering the cash and delivering it to the organizers.
Cobalt uses so-called money mule services for laundering cash. These services attract the financially desperate with promises of easy earnings. Such services are plentiful online. Here are
screenshots of a few examples:

The investigation performed by the Positive Technologies team showed that the theft occurred due to a compromise of the bank’s local network and installation of malware on ATMs
from the bank’s internal infrastructure in August–September 2016. The malware installed on
the ATMs was specialized, dispensing money from an ATM to a drop at the command of the
attacker. Drops themselves did not need to perform any special manipulations of the ATM.

Can the trend be changed?
Cobalt Strike as an attack
tool
Cobalt Strike functionality
includes:
++ Module for phishing attacks
++ Module for drive-by web
app attacks
++ Module for establishing a
beachhead and spreading
on the network (Beacon)
++ Hidden communication
methods, including DNS
tunneling and Peer-To-Peer
SMB

Attacks on bank clients are starting to take a back seat to other methods that are every bit
as effective—attacking the banks themselves, or more precisely, their network infrastructure.
Criminals are aware that not all financial institutions make sufficient investments in their security and often concentrate on the bare minimum of compliance at the expense of actual
security. In addition, attacks on clients are limited to how much money the client has in their
account. But by taking over key servers and ATM controllers, hackers can strike a much more
lucrative payday.
The last few years have seen a trend toward targeted attacks with social engineering and
phishing messages. Most often, organizations (whether a bank, industrial concern, IT firm, or
any other kind of company) concentrate on uptime in business processes, and when it comes
to security, they buy and deploy various expensive solutions from outside vendors. But this
approach has only middling results, closing a few of the most gaping holes in defense, while
leaving untouched the weakest link in security: the human factor.
Attack groups are constantly modernizing their techniques and identifying new vulnerabilities.
By staying at least one step ahead of defenders, attackers set the agenda for the entire security
industry.
As shown by the experience of Positive Technologies, attackers tend to use commonplace
tools, such as software for legitimate pentesting and built-in OS functionality. Cobalt is merely
the most recent example of this trend.

More about Beacon:
++ Written in PowerShell
++ Resides in RAM
++ Advanced remote
management capabilities
(file downloading/
uploading, privilege
escalation, traffic proxy,
keylogger, network scanner)

Detected by antivirus
software
Antivirus software on the
bank servers detected the
infection. Rapid response
by bank security personnel
could have prevented the
incident. However, employees often turn off the
antivirus protection on their
computers and antivirus
logs were not checked at all.

This applies to the attack dissected in this report as well. Criminals used commercially available
software, Cobalt Strike7, to perform penetration testing, including the use of the Beacon trojan.
The Beacon agent is the main payload and is classified as a RAT (Remote Access Trojan).
Widely known legitimate Ammyy Admin software, downloadable from the manufacturer’s
site, was used for remote administration.
Other common tools were used, including:
++ Mimikatz
++ PsExec
++ SoftPerfect Network Scanner
++ TeamViewer
A Pass-the-Hash attack was used for moving about the target infrastructure: OS authentication
was bypassed by using a hash of the password, without even needing to know the password
itself.
It should not be a surprise that criminals have switched to legitimate software for their attacks:
modern remote administration tools for network infrastructure and servers are so powerful
that there is simply no need to invent something else. And as a side benefit for attackers, identifying the use of such software is more difficult. The security of corporate infrastructure at
most banks is poor, leaving an opening that cybercriminals are sure to exploit.

Attack timeline
The attack started in the first week of August. The initial infection vector started with a file
named documents.exe; a RAR archive containing it was received in an email to a bank employee. If not for the employee being on vacation, the phishing message could have compromised
the bank’s entire infrastructure on that very same day. Instead, the attackers had to wait over
two weeks for the workstation to be turned on again. As a consequence, the attackers had to
repeat their actions for developing the attack and elevating privileges in the OS.
For one month, emails were sent to various bank addresses, containing malware while claiming to be from employees of various banks. Analysis showed that the sender addresses were
forged. But the addresses themselves are real and most of them can be found on the official
websites of the bank targeted, or online at curs.md/ru/lista_banci (a site dedicated to information about Moldovan banks).

Subject lines of phishing
messages (translated):
“Documents for signing”
“Reconciliation for 04.08”
“Balance reconciliation for
04.08”
“Yesterday’s meeting
minutes”
“Requirements for IT
Security Staff”

The mail server mail.peacedatamap.com was used to send the messages. Reply-to addresses
were hosted on the domain temp-mail.ru, a site for temporary email addresses. The reply-to
addresses in messages received by bank employees were sesati@lackmail.ru and foyup@lackmail.ru.
Investigation showed that several employees opened the file from the phishing messages at
multiple times, indicating a poor level of security awareness at the organization.
Notably, antivirus software detected both the original malicious attachments and the actions
of the attackers after the compromise—long before money was actually stolen. Suspicious
activity by legitimate software (Ammyy Admin) was detected, and in some cases infection was
prevented by the antivirus software. The original infection took place because the antivirus
software was disabled, or had out-of-date databases, on the workstation of the employee who
ran the malware from the phishing message.
The malware triggers the following verdicts by antivirus software:

To reduce the likelihood of detection, attackers used various strategies:
Warnings for banks
After similar attacks in 2016,
FinCERT issued several
bulletins (ATM-OTH-MLJACKPOTTING-20160921-01,
ATM-OTH-MLJACKPOTTING-20161014-02
and ВК-20160906-001) to
alert banks to the risks and
encourage them to take
preventive measures (such
as by looking for particular
indicators of compromise on
network infrastructure).

++ Legitimate software and built-in OS functions were used.
++ Malware code was run only in RAM.
++ HTTPS was used for command and control.
++ A legitimate service, sendspace.com, was used for file exchange and download of the
original malware.
++ Files were deleted, including with SDelete, to guarantee elimination of data.
++ Actions were performed primarily at night.
After gaining a foothold on the bank infrastructure, the Cobalt team did not rush to act. Only
at the end of August did they substantially develop the attack across the bank’s network. The
attackers compromised the workstations of key employees and critical servers, including terminal server and domain controller. In addition, they stole the passwords of practically all company users, including administrator accounts, which allowed moving about the network at will.
To find and download various utilities (such as Mimikatz), Cobalt accessed legitimate sites and
search engines directly from infected devices. Sites were chosen from the search results (for
example, github.com) and software was downloaded from those sites to workstations and
servers. To download files, the malware used the publicly available site sendspace.com for file
exchange. By using legitimate services, the attackers attempted to mask their actions.

QA matters for criminals
too
Errors in the malware prevented the criminals from
taking money from NCR
ATMs, although they tried to
“troubleshoot” several times
during their attack.

C2 server addresses:
23.249.164.26
149.56.115.70
142.91.104.135
173.254.204.67
23.152.0.210
185.82.202.232

It is important to note that using Mimikatz to get OS account credentials requires local administrator privileges. Key factors in the rapid spread of the attack across the network included the
lack of network segmentation and overprivileged user accounts (the attacked user was a local
administrator on all workstations on the local network). Therefore, the attackers did not need
to use any additional exploits to escalate their privileges or look for methods of penetrating
another network segment.
Another peak of activity occurred in early September, when the criminals actively attacked
network resources in order to identify the workstations of employees responsible for ATMs
and bank cards. These attacks consisted, in essence, of remotely connecting to workstations,
running Мimikatz to collect credentials, surveying the file system and installed software, and
moving on to the next workstation. After compromising the necessary devices, the attackers
had the information needed for initiating the theft itself.
Security logs showed network movement by the attackers from compromised computers, including RAdmin sessions with ATMs. However, RAdmin is actively used by bank administrators
to remotely access computers, including ATMs, and therefore this did not arouse suspicion.
Cobalt went about its plan with practically no special efforts to mask its activity – assuming
that its actions would not be noticed. But the attackers did not hurry to cash in right away.
They studied bank processes and waited for the maximum possible amount of cash to be
present in ATMs.
The attackers waited until early October to load malware on ATMs and steal money. They acted at night in order to minimize possible attention. The operator sent a command to ATMs and
the drops approached ATMs at a particular time and simply took all the money.
Due to an error in the malware code, the attackers were unable to steal money from ATMs
manufactured by NCR. The malware generated errors in the ATM software. Despite attempts
to fix this issue during the attack, including restarting the malware and ATMs multiple times
over the course of two hours, the attackers were unsuccessful. In this case, luck helped the
bank to curtail its losses.
Based on the incident investigation, Positive Technologies experts collected a long list of hostand network-based indicators of compromise, which were sent to the FinCERT of the Bank of
Russia in order to alert banks and prevent similar attacks in the future.

Who says criminals don’t have a sense of humor
During the investigation, Positive Technologies found a curious artifact: the email address used
for downloading Ammyy Admin combined a Russian-language obscenity with the name of
Kaspersky Lab.

In other words, Cobalt expected that Kaspersky Lab would be performing incident investigation. That assumption proved wrong, however, as shown by the work of the Positive
Technologies team.

Cobalt: distinguishing traits
The attackers’ phishing messages were written in Russian. This means that at least one of the
criminals is a Russian speaker. The group knows a fair deal about the banking industry and has
significant resources to support its activities.
A number of similar incidents also indicate that the Cobalt group is Russian-speaking.
Performing such attacks is impossible without knowing internal bank processes, which requires an understanding of Russian.

Conclusion
As shown by this Positive Technologies investigation of a real-world attack by the Cobalt criminal group, media stories of billions in bank losses due to hacking are no tall tale—these attacks
are already happening here and now. Banks must give serious thought to prevention in order
to not become the next target.
More serious losses were avoided only thanks to the swift reaction of the bank, which brought
in outside experts, and law enforcement, which caught one of the drops in the act of withdrawing money.
The criminals attempted to stay unnoticed on the bank network (hoping that use of legitimate
software would not raise suspicions), but antivirus software noticed malicious activity at the
host level. Thus proper security monitoring at the bank, had it been performed, could have
prevented the incident entirely.
Targeted attacks have become a fact of life in recent years. And when choosing their targets,
attackers bypass the little fish—that is, individual clients—in favor of the big fish, the banks
themselves. Instead of elaborate zero-days, hackers use the most common vulnerabilities to
target the weakest link in bank systems. APT attacks are not necessarily as complicated as
they may seem. Banks need to make securing their infrastructure a priority, not just another
checkbox to be completed at audit time. When the next attack occurs, will it be your bank that
is targeted?
