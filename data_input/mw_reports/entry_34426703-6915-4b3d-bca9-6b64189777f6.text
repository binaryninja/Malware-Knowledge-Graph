Iranian Threat Actor Amasses Large
Cyber Operations Infrastructure Network
to Target Saudi Organizations
By Insikt Group®

CTA-2019-0626

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Insikt Group® researchers used proprietary methods, including Recorded Future
Network Traffic Analysis and Recorded Future Domain Analysis, along with common
analytical techniques, to profile Iranian cyberespionage threat actor APT33 (Elfin) and
determine whether the public exposure of their TTPs in March 2019 impacted their
operations.
Data sources include the Recorded Future® Platform, Farsight Security’s DNSDB,
ReversingLabs, VirusTotal, Shodan, and common OSINT techniques.
This report will be of greatest interest to those interested in Middle Eastern geopolitics,
as well as network defenders of organizations with a presence in the Middle East
or in industries targeted by APT33, such as aerospace and defense, energy, finance,
telecommunications, and manufacturing.
This research is based on data collected between February 10, 2019 and June 6, 2019.

Executive Summary
The United States and Iran continue to escalate tensions, most
recently accelerating rhetoric and actions in the Strait of Hormuz,
but also in the cyber domain. Over the past three months, Recorded
Future’s Insikt Group has observed an increase in APT33’s (also
known as Elfin) infrastructure building and targeting activity, and on
June 21, 2019, Yahoo! News reported that the U.S. Cyber Command
launched cyberattacks on an “Iranian spy group.”
Iranian state-sponsored threat actor APT33 has been conducting
cyberespionage activity since at least 2013, predominantly targeting
nations in the Middle East, but also notably targeting U.S., South
Korean, and European commercial entities across a wide variety of
sectors.
Insikt Group researchers used proprietary methods, including
Recorded Future Domain Analysis and Recorded Future Network
Traffic Analysis, along with other common analytical approaches, to
profile recently reported Iranian threat actor APT33’s domain and
hosting infrastructure in an effort to identify recent activity and
better understand the group’s tactics, techniques, and procedures
(TTPs).
Our research found that APT33, or a closely aligned threat actor,
continues to conduct and prepare for widespread cyberespionage
activity, with over 1,200 domains used since March 28, 2019 and
with a strong emphasis on using commodity malware. Commodity
malware is an attractive option for nation-state threat actors who
wish to conduct computer network operations at scale and hide in
plain sight among the noise of other threat actor activities, thus
hindering attribution efforts.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

The targeting of mainly Saudi Arabian organizations across a wide
variety of industries aligns with historical targeting patterns for
the group, which appear undeterred following previous exposés of
their activity. Western and Saudi — both public and private sector
— organizations in industries that have been historically targeted
by APT33 should be monitoring geopolitical developments and
increasing the scrutiny of operational security controls focusing
on detection and remediation of initial unauthorized access,
specifically from phishing campaigns, webshells, and third-party
(vendor and supplier) relationships. Additionally, real-time security
intelligence should be used to improve hunting in internal network
and host-based telemetry.

Key Judgments
• In response to the publication of operations in late March
2019, domains associated with suspected APT33 activity were
parked or changed to new hosting providers.
• APT33, or a closely aligned threat actor, continues to control
C2 domains in bulk.
• Over 1,200 domains have been in use since March 28,
2019 alone.
• 728 of these were identified communicating with
infected hosts.
• 575 of the 728 domains were observed communicating
with hosts infected by one of 19 mostly publicly
available RATs.
• Almost 60% of the suspected APT33 domains that were
classified to malware families related to njRAT infections,
a RAT not previously associated with APT33 activity. Other
commodity RAT malware families, such as AdwindRAT and
RevengeRAT, were also linked to suspected APT33 domain
activity.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

• We assess with medium confidence that APT33, or a closely
aligned threat actor, has targeted the following organizations
since the disclosures in late March:
• A conglomerate headquartered in Saudi Arabia, with
businesses in the engineering and construction,
utilities, technology, retail, aviation, and finance sectors
• Two Saudi healthcare organizations
• A Saudi company in the metals industry
• An Indian mass media company
• A delegation from a diplomatic institution
• We assess that the recent reporting on links between the
Nasr Institute and Kavosh Security Group, as well as technical
and persona analysis, overlaps among APT33, APT35, and
MUDDYWATER, and is probably a result of the tiered structure
that Iran utilizes to manage cyber operations.

Background
APT33 is an Iranian state-sponsored threat actor that has engaged
in cyberespionage activities since at least 2013. They have typically
used commodity malware and possess an expansive network
infrastructure that enables them to scale their operations for victim
targeting. Historically, this targeting has focused on the aerospace
and defense industries, as well as the oil and gas industry, with
a strong focus on companies based in Saudi Arabia. Symantec’s
Elfin report denoted additional targeting of the engineering,
chemical, research, finance, IT, and healthcare sectors. Recorded
Future’s Insikt Group has been monitoring APT33 activity, beginning
with research published in October 2017, which revealed new
infrastructure, malware hashes, and TTPs relating to the threat
actor(s).

Recorded Future | www.recordedfuture.com | CTA-2019-0626 | 3

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Threat Analysis
On March 27, 2019, Symantec published research titled, “Elfin:
Relentless Espionage Group Targets Multiple Organizations in
Saudi Arabia and U.S.” The report outlined a three- year APT33
cyberespionage campaign. Using the IP addresses and malware
hashes provided in that research, Insikt Group researchers
conducted a follow-up analysis of the malicious domains used by
APT33 to determine two things:
1. Whether or not APT33 had continued their activities, and if so,
if they had changed TTPs in response to the publication
2. Whether or not there were any previously unreported
historic activities conducted by the group that were worthy of
publication
Nasr Institute and Kavosh Redux
In our previous report, “Iran’s Hacker Hierarchy Exposed,” we
concluded that the exposure of one APT33 contractor, the Nasr
Institute, by FireEye in 2017, along with our intelligence on the
composition and motivations of the Iranian hacker community,
pointed to a tiered structure within Iran’s state-sponsored offensive
cyber program. We assessed that many
According to a sensitive Insikt Group source who provided
information for previous research, these organizations employed a
mid-level tier of ideologically aligned task managers responsible for
the compartmentalized tasking of over 50 contracting organizations,
who conducted activities such as vulnerability research, exploit
development, reconnaissance, and the conducting of network
intrusions or attacks. Each of these discrete components, in
developing an offensive cyber capability, were purposefully
assigned to different contracting groups to protect the integrity
of overarching operations and to ensure the IRGC and/or MOIS
retained control of operations and mitigated the risk from rogue
hackers.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Obfuscating Iranian government involvement in offensive campaigns.

FireEye also noted in their 2017 report that the online handle
“xman_1365_x,” found within the PDB path in an APT33 TURNEDUP
backdoor sample, belonged to an individual at the Nasr Institute.
The same handle was then linked to destructive operations using
NewsBeef and StoneDrill malware families. Then, in March 2017,
researchers linked StoneDrill to the Shamoon 2 operation and to
the APT35 (also known as Charming Kitten, Newscaster, or NewBeef)
threat actor.
Our previous analyses showed that the person behind the
“xman_1365_x” handle self-identified on Iranian hacking forums
as Mahdi Honarvar from Mashhad, with speculation that he was
also affiliated with the Kavosh Security Center since around 2017.

Recorded Future | www.recordedfuture.com | CTA-2019-0626 | 5

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Kavosh’s role within the Iranian cyber ecosystem was further
uncovered by Group-IB’s recent analysis detailing that Kavosh
was the employer for “Nima Nikjoo” between 2006 and 2014.
Their analysis concluded that a March 2019 campaign targeting
a Turkish military electronics manufacturer was perpetrated by
another Iranian threat actor, MUDDYWATER. MUDDYWATER used
the POWERSTATS backdoor, proliferated in maldocs that contained
metadata revealing the author as “Gladiyator_CRK,” with a possible
name of “Nima.” Additionally, an email address suspected to be
related, “gladiyator_cracker@yahoo.com,” was associated with
“
,” which translates to “Nima Nickjou,” in a 2014 blog that
exposed the names and email addresses of individuals allegedly
employed at the Nasr Institute. Another research blog authored by
pseudonym “0xffff0800” corroborated some of these findings and
revealed “Nima Nikjoo” to be “Nima Nikjoo Tabrizi.”

LinkedIn profile picture of suspected APT33 threat actor Nima Nikjoo Tabrizi. (Accessed on June 14, 2019)

Who Is Nima Nikjoo Tabrizi?
OSINT reveals there is an active Linkedin account and other active
social media accounts in the name of Nima Nikjoo Tabrizi, claiming
that he is a reverse engineer and malware analyst at Symantec.
Symantec, however, has confirmed to Recorded Future that Tabrizi
has never worked for them:
“We have been aware of this individual for a long time. Nima Nikjoo is not a Symantec
employee and we have no record of an individual by this name working at Symantec.”

Recorded Future | www.recordedfuture.com | CTA-2019-0626 | 6

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Having been exposed working for the Nasr Institute, a government
organization, and the Kavosh Security Center, which has strong
associations with Iranian state-sponsored cyberespionage
activity, we assess with high confidence that Tabrizi is engaged in
cyberespionage activity on behalf of the Iranian state.

Employment history of suspected APT33 threat actor Nima Nikjoo Tabrizi.

Based on this information, it is possible that upon the exposure of
the Nasr Institute as a front for Iranian state-sponsored offensive
cyber activity, employees transitioned over to other entities, such as
Kavosh, to protect their identities and minimize further exposure.
There were no further widely reported exposures relating to the
Nasr Institute until the links between Mahdi Honarvar to Kavosh
Security Center were revealed in 2017. Therefore, we assess that
the overlapping technical and personal information points to
a historic linkage between the threat actors APT33, APT35, and
MUDDYWATER.

Recorded Future | www.recordedfuture.com | CTA-2019-0626 | 7

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

These technical and persona overlaps among Iranian threat
actors are not unexpected given the tiered structure of Iranian
state management of cyber operations. Within this structure, we
assessed that managers are running multiple teams, some of which
are associated with government organizations and others that are
contracted private companies (such as ITSec Team).

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

As expected, many of the domains exposed in the original Symantec
report have been parked or no longer resolve to a real IPv4 address.
Interestingly, four of the original domains (backupnet.ddns[.]
net, hyperservice.ddns[.]net, servhost.hopto[.]org, and srvhost.
servehttp[.]com) were all updated the day after publication, and
resolve to the same IP, 95.183.54[.]119. This IP is registered to
Swiss-dedicated hosting provider Solar Communications GmBH.
It is unclear as to why these domains were not likewise parked.
Possible reasons include:
• The domains were deemed high value by the threat actor, and
therefore retained for continued operational purposes.
• The operators had difficulty with or could not update the
domains for administrative reasons.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

In order to identify additional related and potentially malicious
infrastructure, we pivoted on the Swiss IP 95.183.54[.]119 and
identified approximately 40 domains that were newly resolving
to the IP since mid-February 2019. We positively identified RAT
malware communication from a selection of domains.

Additionally, many of the domains that resolved to the Swiss IP were
registered with hostnames that reflected the names of commodity
RATs, such as XTreme RAT, xtreme.hopto[.]org, and njRAT ( njrat12.
ddns[.]net), as well as popular tools like Netcat (n3tc4t.hopto[.]
com). Interestingly, a domain spoofing a popular Farsi-language
Telegram channel called BistBots (bistbotsproxies.ddns[.]net) was
also co-hosted on the same IP. We assess that this likely indicates
a desire to target users of BistBots who seek up-to-date, highspeed internet proxies, possibly to circumvent network filtering
and access sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, which
are restricted in Iran.
Further analysis of the domains above, including windowsx.sytes[.]
net, njrat12.ddns[.]net, and wwwgooglecom.sytes[.]net shows
that they have been classified as C2s for Nanocore and njRAT,
according to their respective Recorded Future Intelligence Cards.
The information detailed are correlations derived from hash reports
from malware multiscanner repositories and malware detonations
that contain direct references to the domains.

Interestingly, while the Symantec research noted APT33’s use of
Nanocore, njRAT was not mentioned, which indicates a previously
unknown addition to the group’s ever-expanding repertoire of
commodity malware.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Deeper Infrastructure Correlations
Insikt Group enumerated all domains reported as being used
by APT33 since January 2019. We pivoted through common
infrastructure hosting patterns using passive DNS and similar
approaches to identify additional suspected APT33 infrastructure.
A preliminary analysis identified 1,252 unique, correlated domains
likely administered by the same APT33 attackers behind the
campaign documented by Symantec. Of these, 728 domains were
identified as communicating with files on infected hosts, with 575 of
these positively correlated to a RAT malware family. The remaining
153 domains were identified as malicious based on AV engine hits
but could not be conclusively classified to a specific malware family
automatically.
Editor’s Note: A selection of the domains, hashes, and associated IP address
infrastructure connected to suspected APT33 domains will soon be made available
to Recorded Future clients in a specialized Certified Data Set called “Weaponized
Domains,” enabling companies to regulate the interaction with malicious free/
anonymous infrastructure, including dynamic DNS (DDNS) domains.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

From the table and the accompanying chart, we noted that APT33, or
a closely aligned threat actor, have been prolific in their continued
use of commodity malware and publicly available tooling, and
have added several malware families previously unreported to
be associated with the threat actor, including njRAT, RevengeRAT,
and AdwindRAT. A significant proportion of the samples (25%),
while deemed malicious, contained generic code that could not
be definitively classified at a high enough degree of confidence to
warrant further manual static analysis. We will continue to focus
closely on these samples in subsequent analyses.
Many of the domains uncovered spoofed global technology
providers such as Microsoft and Google, as well as businessoriented, web-based services such as video conferencing provider
Zoom. Geopolitically themed domains were also present in this list
of suspected APT33 infrastructure, such as vichtorio-israeli.zapto[.]
org (Victory to Israel), fucksaudi.ddns[.]com and palestine.loginto[.]
me. The choice of hostnames may offer insight into the targeting
pattern of APT33 operations against the Islamic Republic of Iran’s
perceived enemies — notably, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the wider
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nations.

Outlook
Following the exposure of a wide range of their infrastructure and
operations by Symantec earlier this year, we discovered that APT33,
or closely aligned actors, reacted by either parking or reassigning
some of their domain infrastructure. The fact that this activity was
executed just a day or so after the report went live suggests the
Iranian threat actors are acutely aware of the media coverage of
their activities and are resourceful enough to be able to react in a
quick manner.

Recorded Future | www.recordedfuture.com | CTA-2019-0626 | 17

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Since late March, suspected APT33 threat actors have continued
to use a large swath of operational infrastructure, well in excess
of 1,200 domains, with many observed communicating with 19
different commodity RAT implants. An interesting development
appears to be their increased preference for njRAT, with over half
of the observed suspected APT33 infrastructure being linked to
njRAT deployment.
While we haven’t observed a widespread targeting of commercial
entities or regional adversaries like in previously documented
APT33 operations, the handful of targeted organizations that we
did observe were mainly located in Saudi Arabia across a range of
industries, indicating ongoing targeting aligned with geopolitical
aims. We assess that the large amount of infrastructure uncovered
in our research is likely indicative of wider ongoing operational
activity, or the laying of groundwork for future cyberespionage
operations. We recommend organizations take measures to monitor
their networks for evidence of suspected APT33 activity by following
the guidance in the “Network Defense Recommendations” section
below.
Finally, our recommendation to Recorded Future clients is to use
our upcoming “Weaponized Domains” Certified Data Set, which has
been derived from predictive analytics that assist in the identification
of malicious APT infrastructure. This is meant to empower your
security teams to hunt, detect, and block high-fidelity malicious
indicators at scale.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Network Defense Recommendations
Recorded Future recommends that organizations conduct the
following measures in order to detect and mitigate suspected
APT33 activity:
• Configure your intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion
prevention systems (IPS), or any network defense mechanisms
in place to alert on — and upon review, consider blocking
illicit connection attempts from — the external IP addresses
and domains listed in Appendix A.
• As detailed in our previous blog on APT33 available to our
clients only, Dynamic DNS (DDNS) continues to be a relevant
operational choke point for security control implementation.
All TCP/UDP network traffic involving DDNS subdomains
should be blocked and logged (using DNS RPZ or similar).
• Conduct regular Yara scans across your enterprise for the new
rules listed in Appendix B.
