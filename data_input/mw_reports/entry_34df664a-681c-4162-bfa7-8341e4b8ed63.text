Graph shows attacks of Troldesh blocked by Avast. Last spike on right is from June 24.
Troldesh (aka Shade) was spread by phishing emails last winter, and is reportedly now being
spread via social networks and other messaging platforms, where posts point to malicious
links.
Avast researcher Jakub Křoustek was able to track a spike Monday (June 24) predominantly
in Russia and Mexico, but with smaller spikes in the U.K. and Germany.

“We see a spike in the number of its attacks that is probably more to do with Troldesh
operators trying to push this strain harder and more effectively than any kind of significant
code update,” Křoustek said. “Troldesh has been spreading in the wild for years with
thousands of victims with ransomed files and it will probably stay prevalent for some time.”
Ransomware caused global disruption in 2017’s WannaCry outbreak. Last spring a
ransomware attack locked up many of the files of the city of Baltimore, and other attacks hit
Atlanta, San Antonio, and other cities. It is a type of malicious software (aka malware) that is
designed to take your computer files – and sometimes even your entire computer – hostage.
The malware encrypts your files so that they cannot be opened, or it locks you out of your
computer completely to prevent access to all of those important photos, videos, accounting
files, work documents, and other files. Many security experts advise against paying ransom
to hackers because it empowers them, and encrypted files are often not released, anyway.
