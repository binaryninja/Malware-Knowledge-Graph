This is a translation of our original german reporting.
Law enforcement agencies have conducted a large-scale raid of the German state malware
company group FinFisher last week. The customs authorities are investigating the suspicion
„that software may have been exported without the required export license from the Federal
Office of Economics and Export Control“.
The raids follow our criminal complaint, which we have written and submitted together with
the Society for Freedom Rights, Reporters Without Borders and the European Center for
Constitutional and Human Rights.

15 objects
A spokesperson of the responsible public prosecutor’s office in Munich comments:

1/3

In co-operation with the Customs Investigation Bureau and supported by further
prosecution authorities the public prosecutor’s office Munich I searched 15 objects
(business premises and private apartments) around Munich and an enterprise from the
entrepreneurial group in Romania on 06.10.2020. The search lasted until the evening
of 08.10.2020.
Investigations are still being conducted against managing directors and employees of
FinFisher GmbH and at least two other companies on suspicion of violation of the
Foreign Trade and Payments Act. The investigations were started in summer 2019 on
the basis of criminal charges.
German public broadcasting first reported the raid.

3 days
FinFisher advertises its state malware as „complete IT intrusion portfolio“, both German
federal police and Berlin police have purchased the powerful surveillance tool. Variants of the
FinFisher suite have been found in dictatorships like Ethiopia and Bahrain, or more recently
again in Egypt.
In summer 2017 a FinFisher sample was discovered in Turkey. The authors of the criminal
complaint assume that FinFisher is developed and produced in Munich. If true, the group of
companies needs an export license, which the German government has not issued. An
export without a license would be a criminal offense.
FinFisher denies these accusations. In a statutory declaration, the CEO states in September
2019:
FinFisher Labs GmbH has developed the FinFisher software.
FinFisher GmbH has at no time sold or distributed the FinFisher software in Turkey.
Against this background, FinFisher GmbH has at no time violated export regulations of
the Federal Republic of Germany or the EU.
The company Elaman also states, it „at no time sold or distributed the FinFisher software in
Turkey“.

After our intial reporting on the criminal complaint, FinFisher took legal action with expensive
lawyers and obtained a preliminary injunction against us, which was confirmed by the Berlin
Regional Court. According to the court our accusations were not provable and our reporting
was too one-sided and prejudicial. On the advice of our lawyer, we did not appeal the verdict
any further.

2/3

The Customs Investigation Bureau and Public Prosecutors however take the accusations of
criminal charges seriously enough to search 15 business premises and private apartments in
Munich and Romania over a period of three days. If the investigators find enough evidence,
they can bring the case to trial.
Until then the presumption of innocence applies. We have sent a number of questions to
FinFisher GmbH and its partner companies for this reporting. FinFisher, as always, has not
responded to our request for comments.
