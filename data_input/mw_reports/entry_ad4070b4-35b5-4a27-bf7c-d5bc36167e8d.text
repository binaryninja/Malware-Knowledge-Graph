Chaos Computer Club from Germany has tonight announced that they have located a
backdoor trojan used by the German Government.

The announcement was made public on ccc.de with a detailed 20-page analysis of the
functionality of the malware.

The malware in question is a Windows backdoor consisting of a DLL and a kernel driver.
The backdoor includes a keylogger that targets certain applications. These applications
include Firefox, Skype, MSN Messenger, ICQ and others.
The backdoor also contains code intended to take screenshots and record audio,
including recording Skype calls.
In addition, the backdoor can be remotely updated. Servers that it connects to include
83.236.140.90 and 207.158.22.134.
We do not know who created this backdoor and what it was used for.
We have no reason to suspect CCC's findings, but we can't confirm that this trojan was
written by the German government. As far as we see, the only party that could confirm
that would be the German government itself.
Our generic policy on detecting governmental backdoors or "lawful interception" police
trojans can be read here.
We have never before analyzed a sample that has been suspected to be governmental
backdoor. We have also never been asked by any government to avoid detecting their
backdoors.
Having said that, we detect this backdoor as Backdoor:W32/R2D2.A
The name R2D2 comes from a string inside the trojan: "C3PO-r2d2-POE". This string is
used internally by the trojan to initiate data transmission.

We are expecting this to become a major news story. It's likely there will be an official
response from the German government.
