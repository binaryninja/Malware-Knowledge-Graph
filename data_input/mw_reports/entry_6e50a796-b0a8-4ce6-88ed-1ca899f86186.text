Cybersecurity researchers at Foregenix have discovered what appears to be a new module
for the ModPipe malware, previously reported by ESET in November 2020. Alarmingly, this
new module has the ability to siphon sensitive Track1 and Track2 data from payment
1/3

systems, a featureset that had not previously been disclosed. Like the originally analysed
and documented ModPipe, this module is most prevalent in the hospitality sector. This
malware should be considered a high risk.
The CCSiphon (aka “JHook”) module was observed in the wild targeting the CCS.exe
application which is at the core of the RES 3700 POS management system, made by
Oracle’s Micros (Oracle Food and Beverage and Oracle Hospitality). What’s fascinating
about the module is that it strategically inserts itself between the Micros application and the
decryption mechanism used by the system. This “app in the middle” listens when the Micros
application needs to decrypt the payment card data. While Micros thinks it’s talking to the
official Microsoft DPAPI decryption routine, it is actually passing data that requires decryption
directly to the malware. The siphon then leverages the actual crypto routines, quietly
examining the data returned for evidence that it contains Track data. If Track data is found,
the CCSiphon malware quietly writes the data to a buffered communications channel to be
harvested later.
Foregenix researchers point out that while this sample of the new module is targeting the
Micros RES 3700 system specifically, it’s dynamic mode of operation, (controlled by a
configuration string presented to the malware module) enables it to attack any payment
processing application. This “configuration string” defines the details of how the application
hook should be implemented and which payment process should be targeted.
The malware even has a fallback mechanism that could be used where a similar hooking
approach is applied to the fundamental mechanism the system uses to move memory
contents around. Should a more specific approach be unsuitable, this backup will provide
access to the target data.
This siphon module is basically “file-less” in its design. The module is inserted into memory
directly from the C2 channel. The siphoned data is also written to a location in memory so it
leaves little-or-no footprint on the system to be detected. At the time of this article, none of
the antivirus companies seem to have detected this code.
While the original ModPipe malware was not attributed to any particular attack group,
Foregenix identified similarities comparing CCSiphon to the RDFScanner module in the
Boostwrite malware reported by Mandiant in 2019. That attack was attributed to Fin7, and
targeted NCR’s Aloha Point of Sale system. Additional research performed by Foregenix
suggests that ModPipe may have passed unnoticed for a considerable period of time, with
similar variants being available on VirusTotal also going back to 2019.
“Attackers are certainly getting more sophisticated”, says Chris Hague, Global Manager
Digital Forensics & Incident Response at Foregenix. “...This may be a game changer for PCI
SSF (formerly PA-DSS) and other security standards.”. It was also pointed out that the
approach taken by this malware differs significantly from traditional “memory scrapers”. The
latter generally scan memory on some form of timed cycle, leaving small windows of
2/3

opportunity where payment details are “missed” by the malware. With the approach
implemented by this variant of ModPipe every payment card processed can and would be
intercepted by the malware. Coupled with it’s stealthy operation, this could pose a significant
risk to retailers.
