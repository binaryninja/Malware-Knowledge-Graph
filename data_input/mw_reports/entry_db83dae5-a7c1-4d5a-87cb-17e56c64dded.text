Criminal interest in MacOS continues to grow, with malware authors churning out more threats that target
users of the popular OS. Case in point: A new variant of a Mac backdoor (detected by Trend Micro as
Backdoor.MacOS.NUKESPED.A) attributed to the cybercriminal group Lazarus, which was observed
targeting Korean users with a macro-embedded Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.
Similarities to an earlier Lazarus iteration
We analyzed a malicious sample ﬁrst discovered by Twitter user cyberwar_15, and found that it used an
Excel document with an embedded macro, which is similar to a previous attack by the Lazarus group.

Figure 1. The spreadsheet displays a fairly known psychological test (similar to one found here); clicking on
the smiley image on the top left shows a different response depending on the user’s answer.

However, unlike the previous attack that contains a different routine based on the OS the spreadsheet is
running on, the macro in this ﬁle will just run a PowerShell script that connects to three C&C servers set up
by the group:

hxxps[:]//craypot[.]live/board[.]php, and hxxps[:]//indagator[.]club/board[.]php.

Figure 3. Comparison of SentinelOne’s code snippet of the malicious macro used in the abovementioned
previous attack (left) and the code snippet of the recently discovered one (right). The latter shows that it no
longer performs any speciﬁc action if it runs on a Mac platform. The “#If Mac Then” MacOS-speciﬁc attack
does not start with malicious macros this time.
Mac app bundle contains malicious and legitimate Flash Players
Apart from the analyzed sample, @cyberwar_15, as well as Qianxin Technology, were also able to source an
in-the-wild Mac app bundle suspected to be involved in the attack since it shares similar C&C servers with
the malicious spreadsheets.

However, this is only a decoy since the actual Adobe Flash Player is contained as a hidden Mach-O ﬁle. The
bundle contains two Flash Player ﬁles: a legitimate version and a malicious version
(Trojan.MacOS.NUKESPED.B). The app will run the smaller-sized Flash Player as its main executable,
which is the malicious version that only poses as a “Flash Player” by name. It also runs the legitimate Flash
Player to hide its actual malicious routine.

Figure 5. The bundle contains two Flash Player ﬁles — one legitimate version and one malicious version.

Figure 6. A closer look at the bundle revealed that this Flash Player app was developed by someone named
Oleg Krasilnikov, who has no relation to Adobe Inc.
When running the Mac app, the malicious Flash Player will run the legitimate one to play a decoy SWF
video.

Figure 7. The SWF video, which plays a Korean song in the background, shows a collection of pictures.
Our own analysis of the sample revealed that while the video is playing, the malicious Flash Player creates
another hidden ﬁle (Backdoor.MacOS.NUKESPED.A) in the following path: ~/.FlashUpdateCheck.

Figure 8. The malicious Flash Player creates a hidden ﬁle at ~/.FlashUpdateCheck while the legitimate Flash
Player plays a video. Note: The symbol (~) is equivalent to the path of the current user.
Subsequently, a persistence mechanism for this hidden ﬁle is installed through dropped PLIST ﬁle
~/Library/Launchagents/com.adobe.macromedia.plist.

Figure 9. Code snippet of ~/Library/Launchagents/com.adobe.macromedia.plist being dropped. The hidden
ﬁle ~/.FlashUpdateCheck is set as its autorun target.
Further inspection shows that the hidden ﬁle ~/.FlashUpdateCheck acts as the dropped Powershell scriptequivalent of the Macro-embedded document. We have identiﬁed functions related to its C&C
communication with the following servers:

The variant’s backdoor functions
To trigger the backdoor functions of Backdoor.MacOS.NUKESPED.A, it must ﬁrst try to establish a
connection with the abovementioned servers, craypot[.]live being the ﬁrst in order. Upon successful
connection, it would continue to its actual backdoor routine.

Figure 11. In this routine, the ﬁle would evaluate the server’s response and perform speciﬁc functions based
on the received command number.

Figure 14. The MacOS hidden ﬁle has backdoor functions that are similar to those of the executed hidden
PowerShell script in the Excel spreadsheet sample (for example, the command 11 for both is the GetHostInfo
function).
Conclusion
Unlike Lazarus’ earlier method, which used macros to download a backdoor Mac ﬁle, the samples we
analyzed reveal that this attack type uses an app with a decoy while running the malicious routine to separate
the entire Mac attack chain.
Cybercriminal groups such as Lazarus are expanding their scope of attack through different platforms. The
Lazarus group’s shift from using a single cross-platform method for starting an attack chain to a more OSspeciﬁc crafted variant is something to take note of — and something we should expect on future related
cases.
Security recommendations
To avoid attacks involving Backdoor.MacOS.NUKESPED.A, users should only download apps from ofﬁcial
sources. This simple practice minimizes the chances of downloading a malicious app. Users can also beneﬁt
from security solutions such as Trend Micro Home Security for Mac, which provides comprehensive security
and multi-device protection against cyberthreats.
Enterprises, for their part, should take advantage of Trend Micro’s Smart Protection Suites with XGen™
security, which infuses high-ﬁdelity machine learning into a blend of threat protection techniques to eliminate
security gaps across any user activity or endpoint.
