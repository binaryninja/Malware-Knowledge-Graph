ESET unmasks ‘GREYENERGY’ cyber-espionage group
eset.com/int/greyenergy-exposed/

Sophisticated threat actor, linked to previous ‘BlackEnergy’ cyberattacks,
targets high-value organizations
GreyEnergy finally exposed
ESET researchers just unmasked the shadowy cyber-espionage group dubbed
GreyEnergy. It’s the successor to the BlackEnergy APT group which went ‘underground‘ a
few years ago after terrorizing Ukraine until 2015. It’s also closely related to TeleBots,
responsible for NotPetya, perhaps the most damaging cyberattack experienced.
Our researchers have demonstrated beyond doubt that GreyEnergy’s malware toolkit both
mirrors and improves on already-sophisticated techniques used in the devastating
NotPetya attacks and Ukraine power grid outages.

ESET’s exposure of GreyEnergy is important for a successful defense against this
particular threat actor as well as for better understanding the tactics, tools and
procedures of the most advanced APT groups.

Organizations at risk
The consequences for organizations of all sizes can be devastating. Compared to
BlackEnergy, GreyEnergy is a more modern toolkit with an even greater focus on stealth.
ESET researchers have demonstrated that GreyEnergy has the capacity to take full
control of entire company networks.
One basic stealth technique is to push only selected modules to selected targets, and only
when needed. In addition, some GreyEnergy modules are partially encrypted and some
remain fileless – running only in memory – with the intention of hindering analysis and
detection.
To cover their tracks, typically, GreyEnergy’s operators securely wipe the malware
components from the victims’ hard drives.
The modules described in ESET’s analysis were used for espionage and reconnaissance
purposes and include: backdoor, file extraction, taking screenshots, keylogging, password
and credential stealing.
