In at least two instances, threat actors used batch scripts
labeled pss.bat and psc.bat to run the PsExec tool. In addition,
threat actors changed the name of the PsExec tool to ps.exe.

The threat actors accessed files pertaining to ICS or supervisory
control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. Based on a DHS
analysis of existing compromises, these file names included ICS
vendor labels and ICS reference documents pertaining to the
organization, such as SCADA WIRING DIAGRAM.pdf and SCADA
PANEL LAYOUTS.xlsx. These types of actions are known as data
smuggler behaviors.

Analysis of cyberattacker behaviors in the
energy and utilities industry
The information in this spotlight report is based on observations
and data from the 2018 Black Hat Edition of the Attacker Behavior
Industry Report from Vectra®. The report reveals attacker behaviors
and trends in networks from over 250 opt-in customers in
manufacturing and eight other industries.
From January-June 2018, the Cognito™ cyberattack-detection
and threat-hunting platform from Vectra monitored network
traffic and collected rich metadata from more than 4 million
devices and workloads from customer cloud, data center and
enterprise environments.
The analysis of this metadata provides a better understanding
about attacker behaviors and trends as well as business
risks, enabling Vectra energy and utilities customers to avoid
catastrophic data breaches.

The Cognito platform observed that cyberattackers used the same types of threat behaviors to spy, spread, and steal data from energy
and utilities enterprise networks. Every industry has a profile of network and user behaviors specific to their industry because of their
business model, applications and processes. These behavior profiles allow attackers to hide, making it difficult for anomaly detection to
succeed because their behaviors blend in with traffic from legitimate users.

Figure 3: Command-and-control attacker behaviors in the energy and utilities industry per 10,000 host devices

Every cyberattack begins with some form of command and control, and one of the most dangerous forms is external remote access. The
Cognito platform detected 194 command-and-control attack behaviors for every 10,000 host devices inside energy and utilities networks, as
shown in Figure 3.
With external remote access, attackers directly control host devices rather than using an automated form of command and control. External
remote access behaviors can involve internal host devices connecting to an external server. In this case, the traffic pattern is inverse from
normal client-to-server traffic. Clients receive instructions from the server and a human on the outside controls the exchange.
Energy and utilities organizations use forms of remote access technology to improve productivity and it can be a legitimate command-andcontrol behavior. However, the presence of remote network access traffic introduces a risk because it enables attackers to blend in while
performing the same types of external remote access for nefarious deeds. This is especially true when attackers leverage commonly-used
remote access tools like FortiClient VPN.

Figure 4: Reconnaissance attacker behaviors in the energy and utilities industry per 10,000 host devices

Reconnaissance inside a network is a precursor to the more risky and damaging stages of active attacks that ultimately exposes an
organization to the substantial risk of data acquisition and exfiltration.
The two most prevalent reconnaissance behaviors in the DHS report are file-share enumeration and RDP recon activity. As shown in Figure
4, the Cognito platform detected 93 file-share enumeration attempts in energy and utilities per 10,000 host devices and workloads. RDP
recon activity occurred 54 times per 10,000 host devices and workloads.
File-share enumeration behaviors occur when a host device accesses inordinately more file-shares than normal. Enumeration might
indicate a host device is accessing many file-shares as a user attempts to find a file or directory. However, enumerating file-shares on a
network is also an effective way for attackers to find data to exfiltrate or data that helps further the attack.
In conjunction with file-share enumeration, a scan via RDP is an effective way for an attacker to determine the accounts available within
an organization’s network and the RDP servers that accept logins via the accounts. File-share enumeration and RDP reconnaissance are
quiet, less noticeable forms of reconnaissance behavior than port sweeps or port scans. As a result, attackers often feel they can use
these tools with relatively low risk of detection.

Figure 5: Lateral movement attacker behaviors in the energy and utilities industry per 10,000 host devices

Lateral movement inside a network exposes a larger attack surface to cybercriminals and substantially increases the risk of data acquisition
and data exfiltration.
Unexplained and unusual patterns of use of host devices, domain controllers and services are involved in almost all major breaches.
Attacks carried out by insiders will often exhibit unusual patterns of use as well.
The compromised host devices and services accessed provide perspective on the potential business impact. As reported by the
TA18-074A alert issued by the DHS, the most common lateral movement behaviors inside energy and utilities companies were suspicious
remote execution.
As shown in Figure 5, the Cognito platform detected 314 suspicious remote execution behaviors per 10,000 workloads and devices. The
suspicious use of Kerberos accounts was detected two times per 10,000 host devices and workloads, while suspicious administrative
activity was observed 37 times per 10,000 host devices and workloads.
Lateral movement via remote execution is a key element of many different attacks and the server message block (SMB) channel allows the
copying of executables and executing them via remote procedure call (RPC). Systems that are authorized to perform remote execution
should be monitored because they enable attackers to hide in plain sight.

Vectra | The hidden threat of cyberattacks in the energy and utilities industry | 7

A Kerberos account is suspicious when it is used differently than expected in one or more ways. This includes connecting to unusual
domain controllers, using unusual host devices and accessing unusual services, or generating unusual volumes of Kerberos requests using
normal domain controllers, usual host devices and usual services.
More importantly, administrative protocols are a favorite tool of attackers because they allow cybercriminals to move laterally inside
networks where they have already established a durable foothold.
Because administrative connections are typically used in conjunction with administrative credentials, attackers often have unconstrained
access to systems and data that are critical to energy and utilities organizations. Unexpected and unexplained administrative connections
represent a huge potential risk in the lifecycle of a major breach.

Figure 6: Exfiltration attacker behaviors in the energy and utilities industry per 10,000 host devices

Energy and utilities networks exhibit significant behaviors in which internal host devices acquire large amounts of data from one or more
internal servers and send large amounts of data to an external system.
These behaviors alone do not necessarily indicate an attack. An attack is likely when exfiltration behaviors correlate with other attacker
behaviors in different phases of the attack lifecycle, such as command and control, reconnaissance or lateral movement. It is also critical to
ensure that systems communicate only to approved locations.
As shown in Figure 6, these exfiltration behaviors, described as data smuggler, were detected by the Cognito platform inside energy and
utilities networks 293 times per 10,000 host devices and workloads.

Vectra | The hidden threat of cyberattacks in the energy and utilities industry | 8

To understand if these potential threat behaviors are of concern,
the internal servers from which the data was retrieved can provide
some indication of the type of data that was acquired. If those
servers contain valuable information and the external service to
which data was uploaded is not an IT-authorized service, the
potential business risk is exceptionally high.
