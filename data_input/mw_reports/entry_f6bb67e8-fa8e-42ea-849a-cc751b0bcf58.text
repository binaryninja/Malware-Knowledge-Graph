Attackers Profiting from Proxyware

Proxyware is a program that shares a part of the Internet bandwidth that is currently
available on a system to others. Users who install the program are usually paid with a certain
amount of cash in exchange for providing the bandwidth. Companies that provide such a
service include Peer2Profit and IPRoyal. They gain profit by providing the bandwidth to
other companies and claim on their webpages that they have various business partners
using the service for distributing software, investigating markets, verifying advertisements,
testing software, and so on.
While users can earn some money from installing proxyware on their systems, they should
know they are taking risks by allowing external users to perform certain behaviors by using
their networks. For instance, users cannot know in detail the companies that the proxyware
platforms claim to use their services. Even if they can verify their customers on their own, it is
impossible to check if your bandwidth will be maliciously exploited in the future or not.

Figure 1. IPROYAL claiming how your network is used
The ASEC analysis team recently discovered malware strains installing proxyware without
the user’s permission. Users whose systems are infected with the malware have their
network bandwidth stolen by attackers to gain profit. The method of earning profit by using
the infected system’s resources is similar to that of CoinMiner. This type of malware has
been continuously around for a while. Cisco Talos once made an analysis on proxyware in
2021.[1]

1. Case using Adware
The post will first discuss malware distributed through adware. AhnLab’s ASD log shows that
the proxyware is installed through adware such as Neoreklami.

Figure 2. Proxyware installed through Neoreklami
It is a dropper-type malware that installs proxyware of Peer2Profit and IPROYAL on the
system as a user account without the user’s permission.

…. 1.1. PEER2PROFIT
As for Peer2Profit, the malware creates Peer2Profit SDK DLL saved in the data section in
the same path. According to the manual shown below, Peer2Profit SDK can use the
p2p_is_active() function to check if a proxy client is running or not. It can also start a proxy
with the p2p_start() function.

Figure 3. Peer2Profit SDK manual
The malware follows the instruction shown in the manual: it loads the created SDK DLL and
gives the attacker’s email address as an argument to execute the p2p_start() function. The
malware can operate in the infected system without the user realizing it to steal the Internet
bandwidth as a result. The attacker can gain profit through the designated email address (the
attacker’s account).

…. 1.2. IPROYAL PAWNS
The dropper malware also installs IPRoyal’s Pawns as well. The dropper initially used the
CLI exe form of Pawns. IPRoyal programs are usually in GUI forms. Yet as it supports the
CLI form as well, it can be executed with command lines and installed without users
recognizing the process.

Figure 5. IPRoyal Pawns CLI programs
The file forcibly terminates Pawns in CLI form if it is currently running. It then creates Pawns
in the same path, similar to Peer2Profit SDK. It gives the attacker’s email address and
password as arguments to run Pawns, gaining profit from the infected system.

Figure 6. Installation routine for IPRoyal Pawns
Recent cases use Pawns in DLL form instead. The dropper creates pawns.dll in the same
path and loads it. It then calls two functions Initialize() and startMainRoutine().

Figure 7. Execution routine for DLL form of Pawns
Unlike Pawns in CLI form that received the attacker’s email address and password directly
through command line arguments, Pawns in DLL form receives encoded data as an
argument. The string is Base64-encoded. Decoding it will show the following json settings
data.

Figure 8. Base64-decoded argument data
The data is presumably used for verification. In fact, the GUI form IPRoyal uses a similar
method. When logging in to IPRoyal, the GUI client loads libpawns.dll file (libpawns32.dll in
the x86 environment) located in %PROGRAMFILES%\IPRoyal
Pawns\resources\packages\main\resources\libpawns inside the installation path and gives
the settings data encoded in the same method as an argument to call the startMainRoutine()
function.

2. Cases of attacks targeting vulnerable MS-SQL servers
Peer2Profit is used by other attackers as well. The Figure 10 shows a log of Peer2Profit SDK
being installed on a vulnerable MS-SQL server. The system also has infection logs of various
malware strains distributed through the dictionary attack such as CoinMiner and backdoor. It
is likely that the malware installing proxyware was distributed through the dictionary attack as
the system had vulnerable account credentials.

Figure 10. Peer2Profit SDK installed through a vulnerable MS-SQL process
The “sdk.mdf” file is packed with UPX. It has been installed on multiple vulnerable MS-SQL
servers starting from early June in 2022. Due to the nature of Peer2Profit, the file is a DLL
and sends the attacker’s email address as an argument for the export function: the file alone
cannot reveal additional information such as the attacker’s email address.

6/7

The proxyware dropper malware that is recently being discovered is similar to CoinMiner in
that it gains profit by exploiting the infected system’s resources. The malware strains are
distributed through adware or installed on vulnerable MS-SQL servers. Users should refrain
from installing programs from unknown sources. If their systems are installed with database
servers, they should manage access control policies and account credentials settings
appropriately. Also, V3 should be updated to the latest version so that malware infection can
be prevented.
