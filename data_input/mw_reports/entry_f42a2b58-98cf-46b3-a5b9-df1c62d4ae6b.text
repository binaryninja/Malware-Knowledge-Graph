TeleBots are back: Supply-chain attacks
against Ukraine
BY ANTON CHEREPANOV POSTED 30 JUN 2017 - 03:30PM

The latest Petya-like outbreak has gathered a lot of attention from the media. However, it
should be noted that this was not an isolated incident: this is the latest in a series of similar
attacks in Ukraine. This blogpost reveals many details about the Diskcoder.C (aka ExPetr,
PetrWrap, Petya, or NotPetya) outbreak and related information about previously unpublished
attacks.

TeleBots
In December 2016 we published two detailed blogposts about disruptive attacks conducted by
the group ESET researchers call TeleBots, speciﬁcally about attacks against ﬁnancial
institutions and a Linux version of the KillDisk malware used by this group. The group mounted
cyberattacks against various computer systems in Ukraine; systems that can be deﬁned as
critical infrastructure. Moreover, this group has connections with the infamous BlackEnergy
group that was responsible for the December 2015 power outages in Ukraine.
In the ﬁnal stage of its attacks, the TeleBots group always used the KillDisk malware to overwrite
ﬁles with speciﬁc ﬁle extensions on the victims’ disks. Putting the cart before the horse:
collecting ransom money was never the top priority for the TeleBots group. The KillDisk malware
used in the ﬁrst wave of December 2016 attacks, instead of encrypting, simply overwrites
targeted ﬁles. Further, it did not provide contact information for communicating with the attacker;
it just displayed an image from the Mr. Robot TV show.

Figure 2 – The picture displayed by KillDisk malware in the ﬁrst wave of December 2016 attacks.

In the second wave of attacks, the cybersaboteurs behind the KillDisk malware added contact
information to the malware, so it would look like a typical ransomware attack. However, the
attackers asked for an extraordinary number of bitcoins: 222 BTC (about $250,000 at that time).
This might indicate that they were not interested in bitcoins, but their actual aim was to cause
damage to attacked companies.

In 2017, the TeleBots group didn’t stop their cyberattacks; in fact, they became more
sophisticated. In the period between January and March 2017 the TeleBots attackers
compromised a software company in Ukraine (not related to M.E. Doc), and, using VPN tunnels
from there, gained access to the internal networks of several ﬁnancial institutions.
During that attack, those behind TeleBots enhanced their arsenal with two pieces of ransomware
and updated versions of tools mentioned in the previously-linked blogposts.

The ﬁrst backdoor that the TeleBots group relied heavily on was Python/TeleBot.A, which was
rewritten from Python in the Rust programming language. The functionality remains the same: it
is a standard backdoor that uses the Telegram Bot API in order to receive commands from, and
send responses to, the malware operator.

The second backdoor, which was written in VBS and packaged using the script2exe program,
was heavily obfuscated but the functionality remained the same as in previous attacks.

Figure 5 – The obfuscated version of the VBS backdoor.

This time the VBS backdoor used the C&C server at 130.185.250[.]171. To make connections
less suspicious for those who check ﬁrewall logs, the attackers registered the domain
transﬁnance.com[.]ua and hosted it on that IP address. As is evident from Figure 6 this server
was also running the Tor relay named severalwdadwajunior.

In addition, the attacker used the following tools:
CredRaptor (password stealer)
Plainpwd (modiﬁed Mimikatz used for recovering Windows credentials from memory)
SysInternals’ PsExec (used for lateral movement)
As mentioned above, in the ﬁnal stage of their attacks, the TeleBots attackers pushed
ransomware using stolen Windows credentials and SysInternals’ PsExec. This new ransomware
was detected by ESET products as Win32/Filecoder.NKH. Once executed, this ransomware
encrypts all ﬁles (except ﬁles located in the C:⧵Windows directory) using AES-128 and RSA-1024
algorithms. The malware adds the .xcrypted ﬁle extension to already-encrypted ﬁles.
When encryption is done, this ﬁlecoder malware creates a text ﬁle !readme.txt with the following
content:

In addition to Windows malware, the TeleBots group used Linux ransomware on non-Windows
servers. This ransomware is detected by ESET products as Python/Filecoder.R and, predictably,
it is written in the Python programming language. This time attackers execute third-party utilities
such as openssl in order to encrypt ﬁles. The encryption is done using the RSA-2048 and AES256 algorithms.

In the code of Python script, attackers left their comment which had following text:

Win32/Filecoder.AESNI.C
On 18 May 2017, we noticed new activity on the part of another ransomware family
Win32/Filecoder.AESNI.C (also referred to as XData).
This ransomware was spread mostly in Ukraine, because of an interesting initial vector.
According to our LiveGrid® telemetry, the malware was created right after execution of the
M.E.Doc software that is widely used by accounting personnel in Ukraine.
The Win32/Filecoder.AESNI.C ransomware had a spreading mechanism that allowed it to
perform lateral movement automatically, inside a compromised company LAN. Speciﬁcally, the
malware had an embedded Mimikatz DLL that it used to extract Windows account credentials
from the memory of a compromised PC. With these credentials, the malware started to spread
inside its host network using SysInternals’ PsExec utility.
It seems that the attackers either did not reach their goal on that occasion, or it was the test
before a more eﬀective strike. The attackers posted master decryption keys on the
BleepingComputer forum, along with the assertion that this was done because the original
author claimed that the source was stolen and used in the Ukraine incident.
ESET published a decryption tool for Win32/Filecoder.AESNI ransomware, and this event didn’t
gain much media attention.

Diskcoder.C (aka Petya-like) outbreak
What did gain a lot of media attention, however, was the Petya-like outbreak of 27 June, 2017,
because it successfully compromised a lot of systems in critical infrastructure and other
businesses in Ukraine, and further aﬁeld.

The malware in this attack has the ability to replace the Master Boot Record (MBR) with its own
malicious code. This code was borrowed from Win32/Diskcoder.Petya ransomware. That’s
why some other malware researchers have named this threat as ExPetr, PetrWrap, Petya, or
NotPetya. However, unlike the original Petya ransomware, Diskcoder.C’s authors modiﬁed the
MBR code in such a way that recovery won’t be possible. Speciﬁcally, the attacker cannot
provide a decryption key and the decryption key cannot be typed in the ransom screen, because
the generated key contains non-acceptable characters.
Visually this MBR part of Diskcoder.C looks like a slightly modiﬁed version of Petya: at ﬁrst it
displays a message that impersonates CHKDSK, Microsoft’s disk checking utility. During the
faux CHKDISK scan Diskcoder.C actually encrypts the data.

Figure 8 – Fake CHKDSK message displayed by Diskcoder.C.

When encryption is complete, the MBR code displays the next message with payment
instructions, but as noted before this information is useless.

Figure 9 – Diskcoder.C message with payment instructions.

The remainder of the code, other than the borrowed MBR, was implemented by the authors
themselves. This includes ﬁle encryption that can be used as a complement to the diskencrypting MBR. For ﬁle encryption, the malware uses the AES-128 and RSA-2048 algorithms. It
should be noted that the authors made mistakes that make decryption of ﬁles less possible.
Speciﬁcally, the malware encrypts only the ﬁrst 1MB of data and it does not write any header or
footer, only raw encrypted data and does not rename encrypted ﬁles, so it’s hard to say which
ﬁles are encrypted and which are not. In addition to that, ﬁles that are larger than 1MB after
encryption do not contain padding, so there is no way to verify the key.
Interestingly, the list of target ﬁle extensions is not identical but is very similar to the ﬁle
extensions list from the KillDisk malware used in the December 2016 attacks.

Figure 10 – List of target ﬁle extensions from Diskcoder.C.

Once the malware is executed it attempts to spread using the infamous EternalBlue exploit,
leveraging the DoublePulsar kernel-mode backdoor. Exactly the same method was used in the
WannaCryptor.D ransomware. Diskcoder.C also adopted the method from the
Win32/Filecoder.AESNI.C (aka XData) ransomware: it uses a lightweight version of Mimikatz to
obtain credentials and then executes the malware using SysInternals’ PsExec on other machines
on the LAN. In addition to that, the attackers implemented a third method of spreading using a
WMI mechanism.
All three of these methods have been used to spread malware inside LANs. Unlike the infamous
WannaCryptor malware, the EternalBlue exploit is used by Diskcoder.C only against computers
within the local network address space.
Why are there infections in other countries than Ukraine? Our investigation revealed that aﬀected
companies in other countries had VPN connections to their branches, or to business partners, in
Ukraine.

Initial infection vector
Both Diskcoder.C and Win32/Filecoder.AESNI.C used a supply-chain attack as the initial
infection vector. These malware families were spread using Ukrainian accounting software called
M.E.Doc.
There are several options for how this attack can be implemented. The M.E.Doc has an internal
messaging and document exchange system so attackers could send spearphishing messages to
victims. User interaction is required in order to execute something malicious in this way. Thus,
social engineering techniques would be involved. Since Win32/Filecoder.AESNI.C didn’t spread
so widely, we mistakenly assumed that these techniques were used in this case.

However, the subsequent Diskcoder.C outbreak suggests that the attackers had access to the
update server of the legitimate software. Using access to this server, attackers pushed a
malicious update that was applied automatically without user interaction. That’s why so many
systems in Ukraine were aﬀected by this attack. However, it seems like the malware authors
underestimated the spreading capabilities of Diskcoder.C.
ESET researchers found evidence that supports this theory. Speciﬁcally, we identiﬁed a
malicious PHP backdoor that was deployed under medoc_online.php in one of the FTP
directories on M.E.Doc’s server. This backdoor was accessible from HTTP; however, it was
encrypted, so the attacker would have to have the password in order to use it.

Figure 11 – Listing of FTP directory containing the PHP backdoor.

We should say that there are signs that suggest that Diskcoder.C and Win32/Filecoder.AESNI.C
were not the only malware families that were deployed using that infection vector. We can
speculate that these malicious updates were deployed in a stealthy way to computer networks
that belong to high-value targets.
One such malware that was deployed via this possible compromised M.E.Doc update server
mechanism was the VBS backdoor used by the TeleBots group. This time the attacker again
used a ﬁnancially-themed domain name: bankstat.kiev[.]ua.
On the day of the Diskcoder.C outbreak, the A-record of this domain was changed to 10.0.0.1

Conclusions
The TeleBots group continues to evolve in order to conduct disruptive attacks against Ukraine.
Instead of spearphishing emails with documents containing malicious macros, they used a more
sophisticated scheme known as a supply-chain attack. Prior to the outbreak, the Telebots group
targeted mainly the ﬁnancial sector. The latest outbreak was directed against businesses in
Ukraine, but they apparently underestimated the malware’ spreading capabilities. That’s why the
malware went out of control.
