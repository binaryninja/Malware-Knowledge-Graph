Update November 22, 2021: It has been determined that this specific campaign is no
longer active. The command and control server has been taken down, and the
infected devices are no longer under the control of the attackers.
Many of the malware campaigns we have detected over the last year have been global at
scale, targeting anyone with little regard to their location. Recently, we discovered and
began monitoring the activity behind PhoneSpy, a spyware aimed at South Korean
residents with Android devices. With more than a thousand South Korean victims, the
malicious group behind this invasive campaign has had access to all the data,
communications, and services on their devices.
Unlike other spyware campaigns we have covered that take advantage of vulnerabilities on
the device, PhoneSpy hides in plain sight, disguising itself as a regular application with
purposes ranging from learning Yoga to watching TV and videos, or browsing photos. But in
reality, the application is stealing data, messages, images, and remote control of Android

1/26

phones. The data stolen from victim devices ranged from personal photos to corporate
communications. The victims were broadcasting their private information to the malicious
actors with zero indication that something was amiss.
While the victims have been limited to South Korea, PhoneSpy is an example of how
malicious applications can disguise their true intent. When installed on victims’ devices,
they leave personal and corporate data at risk. With mobile devices playing critical roles in
distributed and remote work, it is no surprise that spyware campaigns like PhoneSpy are on
the rise.
Samples of PhoneSpy were not found in any Android app store, indicating that attackers
are using distribution methods based on web traffic redirection or social engineering.
Once in control, the attackers can access the camera to take pictures, record video, and
audio, get precise GPS location, view pictures from the device, and more.
Zimperium zLabs identified the PhoneSpy spyware app during routine threat research, and
the zLabs team launched an investigation after identifying multiple related malicious
applications.
Disclosure: Due to the nature of this spyware campaign, Zimperium has notified and
submitted all relevant threat data to US and South Korean authorities. The Zimperium
team also reported to the host of the command and control server multiple times,
offering support in a takedown of the malicious services. At the time of this writing, the
PhoneSpy spyware campaign is still active.
In this blog, we will:
Cover the capabilities of the Android spyware;
Discuss the techniques used to collect and store data; and
Show the communication with the C&C server to exfiltrate stolen data.

What Can PhoneSpy Spyware Do?
The mobile application poses a threat to Android devices by functioning as an advanced
Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that receives and executes commands to collect and exfiltrate
a wide variety of data and perform a wide range of malicious actions, such as:
Complete list of the installed applications
Steal credentials using phishing
Steal images
Monitoring the GPS location
Steal SMS messages
Steal phone contacts
Steal call logs
2/26

Record audio in real-time
Record video in real-time using front & rear cameras
Access camera to take photos using front & rear cameras
Send SMS to attacker-controlled phone number with attacker-controlled text
Exfiltrate device information (IMEI, Brand, device name, Android version)
Conceal its presence by hiding the icon from the device’s drawer/menu
Upon infection, the victim’s mobile device will transmit accurate GPS locational data, share
photos and communications, contact lists, and downloaded documents with the command
and control server. Similar to other mobile spyware we have seen, the data stolen from
these devices could be used for personal and corporate blackmail and espionage. The
malicious actors could then produce notes on the victim, download any stolen materials,
and gather intelligence for other nefarious practices.

How Does PhoneSpy Spyware Work?
The PhoneSpy spyware disguises itself as various lifestyle apps targeting Korean-speaking
users. It is most likely distributed through web traffic redirection or social engineering as it
has not been detected in Android stores, including third-party or regional stores. After
installation, the application requests permissions and opens a phishing page that imitates
the login page of the popular South Korean messaging app “Kakao Talk” to steal
credentials.
The application follows the typical behavior of spyware by asking for permissions to
exercise its capabilities.

After installation and launch, the app displays a login page and attempts to steal the
credentials for “Kakao” which can be used to login into other services in South Korea with
the Single-Sign-On feature.

Figures.3-5: The phishing pages hosted by the threat actors
In most of the discovered applications, the application’s user/victim interaction is limited to
the above sign-on, only to receive an error message. Many of the applications are facades
of a real app with none of the advertised user-based functionality. In a few other cases, like
simpler apps that advertise as photo viewers, the app will work as advertised all while the
PhoneSpy spyware is working in the background.

Figures.7-10: The fake gallery website displayed by the app & the files hosted on it
While these actions are taking place in the foreground, the spyware abuses its permissions
and acts as a Remote Access Trojan, leaving the device open to access for the threat
actors. The spyware makes sure to avoid data redundancy by only uploading the latest data
created after the last upload, as seen in Figure.11.

The command and control server stores all the exfiltrated data and maintains a
communication channel with the infected devices to send commands.
The table of commands and the corresponding actions are shown in Table.1.

Table.1: Supported commands and associated actions
The command and control server has a web-based interface and is protected by an
authentication mechanism using credentials, as seen in Figure.12.

Figure.12: The login panel of the C&C server
The application is capable of uninstalling any user-installed applications, including mobile
security apps. The device’s precise location is available in real-time to the malicious actors,
all without the victim knowing. The spyware also enables the threat actor to use phishing
pages for harvesting credentials of Facebook, Instagram, Google, and Kakao Talk, just like
the phishing pages shown in Figures.13-15. The threat actor uses the command “33” to
send a phishing URL to the device, and PhoneSpy loads the page. Any credentials typed
into the forms are sent back to the command and control server.

The Victims of the PhoneSpy Spyware Campaign
The Zimperium zLabs mobile threat research team identified 23 applications targeting
South Korean citizens to date, infecting thousands of victims to this spyware campaign.
These malicious Android apps are designed to run silently in the background, constantly
spying on their victims without raising any suspicion. We believe the malicious actors
responsible for PhoneSpy have gathered significant amounts of personal and corporate
information on their victims, including private communications and photos.
Even though thousands of South Korean victims have fallen prey to the spyware campaign,
it is unclear whether they have any connections with each other. But with the ability to
download contact lists and send SMS messages on behalf of the victim, there is a high
22/26

chance that the malicious actors are targeting connections of current victims with phishing
links.

Zimperium vs. PhoneSpy Spyware
Zimperium zIPS customers are protected against PhoneSpy with our on-device z9 Mobile
Threat Defense machine learning engine.
Zimperium on-device phishing classifiers detect the traffic from the domain
https[:]//acd.kcpro.ga as malicious from inception with our machine learning-based
technology, blocking all traffic to it and preventing attackers from taking effective control of
any compromised devices.
All the compromised and malicious applications found were also reviewed using
Zimperium’s app analysis platform, z3A. All these apps returned reports of high privacy and
security risks to the end-user. Zimperium administrators can create risk policies preventing
users from installing high-risk apps like PhoneSpy.
Key privacy risks identified by our z3A service analysis PhoneSpy infected apps are:
Access to SMS messages, camera, call logs, contacts, and location, among others.
The capability of recording audio, video, and starting phone calls.
Use of MQTT library, which can be used to track the user.
23/26

Access device information such as phone number, device ID, if a call is active (and
the phone number the call is being held with).
Tamper with calls, being able to modify the phone number being dialed.
Read/write access to the SD card.
Exposed API keys.
Key The main privacy risks identified by our z3A service analysis of PhoneSpy infected
apps are:
Exposed services with no permissions assigned.
WebView enabled, which can be used to execute JavaScript code.
Malware detected by z9 engine.
The app is built with the debug flag.
Use of system-level permissions and accessibility permissions.
Can modify WiFi connections.
Have the capability to perform overlay attacks (one of the main techniques used by
Banker Trojans).
To ensure your Android users are protected from PhoneSpy spyware, we recommend a
quick risk assessment. Any application with PhoneSpy will be flagged as a Suspicious App
Threat on the device and in the zConsole. Admins can also review which apps are
sideloaded onto the device, increasing the mobile attack surface and leaving data and
users at risk.

PhoneSpy Spyware’s Impact on Global Enterprises
The PhoneSpy Android spyware campaign puts enterprises at as much, if not more, risk
than consumers. The rise of bring your own device (BYOD) policies has blurred the line
between work and personal data and any compromise to the security of an enterpriseconnected device puts all corporate data at risk. Spyware such as PhoneSpy has the
capabilities to read corporate messages, install compromised versions of enterprise
applications, and download locally stored data like documents and photos without the
enterprise or end user knowing. The capability to turn on the mobile camera and
microphone during in-person meetings is also a high risk to businesses. These capabilities,
mixed with the common framework and approach of PhoneSpy, can impact an enterprise’s
security, reveal critical and private data, and lead to loss of customers, research, and data.
