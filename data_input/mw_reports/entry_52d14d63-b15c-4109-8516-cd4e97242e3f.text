Targeted attacks on industrial companies using Snake ransomware (updated)
17 June 2020

According to Kaspersky ICS CERT data, a number of industrial companies are currently
experiencing targeted attacks involving the Snake encryption ransomware.
On June 8, 2020 issues were reported which affected the computer networks of Honda, a
Japanese motorcycle and auto manufacturer, in Europe and Japan. Specifically, it was
announced that Honda Customer Service and Honda Financial Services were experiencing

1/6

technical difficulties. Information security experts believe that, in all likelihood, one of the
company’s servers was infected with Snake (EKANS) ransomware.
A sample of the Snake malware discovered by some researchers on VirusTotal checked for
Honda’s domain name, “mds.honda.com” (which is probably used on the company’s internal
network). If the domain name cannot be resolved (i.e., if the corresponding IP address
cannot be determined), the ransomware terminates without encrypting any files. According to
the researchers, this could indicate that the attackers’ activity is targeted.
Kaspersky ICS CERT experts used their own telemetry data to identify other samples that
were similar to the sample uploaded to VirusTotal. Based on the findings of our research:
1. The malware was launched using a “nmon.bat” file detected by Kaspersky products in
domain policy script folders.
2. The only difference between all of the Snake samples identified is the domain name
and IP address embedded in the code.
3. The IP address embedded in the malware code is compared with the IP address
resolved from the domain name, if the malware was able to resolve it.
4. The malware encrypts data only if the IP address embedded in the malware code
matches the IP address resolved from the domain name that is also embedded in the
malware code.
5. The IP address and domain name combination embedded in the malware code is
unique for each attack we have identified and is apparently valid for the internal
network of the organization targeted by that specific attack.
6. In some cases, the domain names may have been obtained from public sources
(DNS), while information on IP addresses associated with these domain names is
apparently stored on internal DNS servers and is only available when sending DNS
requests from the victim organizations’ internal networks.
7. In addition to the domain name and IP address of the organization under attack, which
are embedded into the malware code, new Snake samples are different from those
identified in December 2019 in that they include an extended list of file extensions
(types) that the malware should encrypt. The new samples include extensions for
virtual drive files, Microsoft Access, source code in С/C#/ASP/JSP/PHP/JS, as well as
the corresponding files of projects/solutions and other extensions that were
unsupported by earlier samples.
The results of our research clearly indicate that the attackers carry out multistage hacker
attacks, each attack targeting a specific organization. Encrypting files using Snake is the final
stage of these attacks.
Each Snake sample was apparently compiled after the attackers had gained the knowledge
of the relevant domain name and its associated IP address on the company’s internal
network. In the malware samples analyzed, the IP address and domain name are stored as

2/6

strings. This means that the executable file cannot be easily changed (patched) after
compilation because the length of these strings varies.
Clearly, checking that the domain name matches the IP address is a technique designed to
prevent the malware from running outside the local network for which the sample was
created.
It is most likely that the attackers used domain policies to spread the ransomware across the
local network. In that case, they had access to the domain administrator’s account,
compromised in the attack’s earlier stages.
It is known that, in addition to Honda, victims include power company Enel Group. According
to Kaspersky ICS CERT data, attack targets also include a German company that supplies
its products to auto makers and other industrial manufacturers and a German manufacturer
of medical equipment and supplies. Apparently, other auto makers and manufacturing
companies have also been attacked: similar Snake samples have been detected on
computers in China, Japan and Europe. We believe the attack may have gone beyond the
victims’ IT systems. Specifically, in one case, the malware was detected and blocked on the
video surveillance server of an organization attacked in China.
All malware samples were proactively blocked by Kaspersky products using the heuristic
signature Trojan-Ransom.Win32.Snake.a, which was created using the original Snake
sample that appeared in December 2019.
It is worth reminding that an important distinguishing feature of Snake is that it targets,
among other things, industrial automation systems – specifically that it is designed to encrypt
files used by General Electric ICS. This is evidenced by the fact that the malware attempts to
terminate the processes of General Electric software before starting the file encryption
process.
Attacks similar to those described above continue. If you have encountered an attack of this
kind, you can report it via a special form on our website.

July 7, 2020 update
Our hypothesis that the attackers used the attacked company’s domain controller to spread
the ransomware across the local network is supported by one more curious fact.
The malware checks the domain role of the computer on which it is running. If the computer
has the domain controller role (DomainController), the function returns the value “1”.

3/6

If the function that checks the attacked computer’s domain role returns “1” (i.e., the computer
has the role of a primary or backup domain controller), the function that calls it returns “0”.
This results in the malware terminating without performing any encryption. The calling
function also checks whether the domain’s IP address matches the hard-coded IP address.

4/6

This means that if, as we believe, the attackers used the domain controller to spread the
malware across the victim’s local network, the domain controller exclusion logic described
above would certainly work for them, since they needed the domain controller to be
operational and unencrypted.

Recommendations
To identify traces of an attack and prevent possible damage, Kaspersky ICS CERT
recommends:
Using the indicators of compromise provided to identify infections on Windows
workstations and servers;
Checking active domain policies and scripts for malicious code;
Checking active tasks in the Windows Task Scheduler on workstations and servers for
malicious code;
Changing the passwords of all accounts in the domain administrator group.
