Operation Transparent Tribe
Threat Insight

Author: Darien Huss

Introduction
Proofpoint researchers recently uncovered evidence of an advanced persistent threat (APT) against Indian diplomatic
and military resources. Our investigation began with malicious emails sent to Indian embassies in Saudi Arabia and
Kazakstan but turned up connections to watering hole sites focused on Indian military personnel and designed to drop a
remote access Trojan (RAT) with a variety of data exfiltration functions. Our analysis shows that many of the campaigns
and attacks appear related by common IOCs, vectors, payloads, and language, but the exact nature and attribution
associated with this APT remain under investigation.
At this time, the background and analysis in this paper provide useful forensics and detail our current thinking on the
malware that we have dubbed “MSIL/Crimson”.

Attack against Indian Embassies in Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan
On February 11, 2016, we discovered two attacks minutes apart directed towards officials at Indian embassies in both
Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan. Both e-mails (Fig. 1, 2) were sent from the same originating IP address (5.189.145[.]248)
belonging to Contabo GmbH, a hosting provider that seems to be currently favored by these threat actors. The e-mails
also likely utilized Rackspace’s MailGun service and both of them were carrying the same exact attachment.
Emails:

In this incident, the attachment was a weaponized RTF document utilizing CVE-2012-0158 to drop an embedded,
encoded portable executable (PE). To decode the embedded PE, the document’s shellcode first searches for the
0xBABABABA marker that, when found, will indicate the beginning position of the PE (Fig. 3). The PE is then decoded
using the key 0xCAFEBABE while skipping null DWORDs (Fig. 4). A final marker indicates the end of the PE file, which, in
this case, is the marker 0xBBBBBBBB. This decode routine, including other components of the exploit document, have
been discussed before and have been observed in completely unrelated incidents.

Figure 4: Decoding of encoded PE and searching for terminator marker
After successful exploitation and decoding of the embedded payload, a family of malware we refer to as MSIL/
Crimson will be executed on the victim’s machine. The first stage in infection is a downloader whose purpose is
to download the more fully featured RAT component. The MSIL/Crimson downloader that was dropped (md5:
3a67ebcab5dc3563dc161fdc3c7fb161) will attempt to download the full RAT from 213.136.87[.]122:10001 (Fig. 5). A full
description and analysis of the MSIL/Crimson malware family is provided in the Technical Analysis section.

Fake blog with an Indian military emphasis leads to MSIL/Crimson and more
While conducting research related to MSIL/Crimson, Proofpoint researchers discovered a malicious blogspot.com site
(Fig. 6), intribune.blogspot[.]com, that appears to have been set up to lure Indian military officials into becoming infected
with MSIL/Crimson, njRAT, and possibly other malicious tools. This site is likely operated by the same actor(s) that carried
out the previously discussed attacks on Indian embassy officials based on shared C&C infrastructure as discussed in the
Cluster Analysis section. Most of the published stories contain some method of directing potential victims to a malicious
payload, although a few of the stories did not contain any malicious code at time of analysis. In the following articles from
this site, we see the threat actors conducting their malicious activities in multiple ways:
1.

Using hyperlinks via an image or text

2.

Using the same hypertext link in the article text, on the story’s image, and in an iframe

3.
The final article in this section contains a link to an additional website that is likely operated by the same threat
actor(s) and connected to other email campaigns

(hash: 0ad849121b4656a239e85379948e5f5d)
Both files in the “/com/” directory are malicious droppers that ultimately drop a decoy Excel spreadsheet and a
MSIL/Crimson downloader. The spreadsheet is themed towards the Armed Forces Officials Welfare Organization
(AFOWO) located in India, while the dropped downloader and downloaded RAT communicate with the same C&C
as many of the previously discussed samples. An Excel spreadsheet named “AFOWO Broucher 2016.xls” (hash:
98bdcd97cd536ff6bcb2d39d9a097319) was also found containing a malicious macro that attempts to download a
payload from hxxp://afgcloud7[.]com/com/psp.dlc . Additionally, the IP address (50.56.21[.]178) resolved from email.
books2day.com (used in the embassy attacks). This IP has also recently resolved to email.afowoblog[.]in. We would not
be surprised if an email address using @afowoblog.in was used to send the malicious “AFOWO Broucher 2016.xls”
spreadsheet. Additional research related to this domain is provided in the Cluster Analysis section.

The payload found in the “/upld/” directory (md5: 0ad849121b4656a239e85379948e5f5d) is the MSIL/Crimson SecApp
module capable of downloading the full MSIL/Crimson RAT and all subsequent modules. Additionally, this payload drops
a decoy document (Fig. 17) with the filename: “Cv of IMA Chief.docx” (hash: 8e5610d88c7fe08ac13b1c9f8c2c44cc). The
decoy document contains information regarding a possible Brigadier General whose last and current position (according
to the decoy) is the Chief of International Military Affairs Department Ministry Defence (sic) of Afghanistan.

Cluster Analysis
In this section we will present our research surrounding the use of the MSIL/Crimson implant and campaigns that are
part of Operation Transparent Tribe. Even though the tool may possibly be used by several threat actors, our research
indicates that the hundreds of Crimson samples may be clustered into a much smaller set of activity as described below.

Cluster 1 - Operation Transparent Tribe and More
The first cluster is the largest with activity from over one hundred samples dating as far back as 2012 (Fig. 18). For this
cluster, we started our analysis beginning with the email attacks on the Indian embassies and the fake Indian news blog.
The activity surrounding those two events uncovered numerous other samples hosted on attacker-controlled C&C that
then lead to at least one additional email attack campaign. On one of the C&Cs we discovered a Python-based RAT
(Python/Peppy) whose activity very closely clusters to Operation Transparent Tribe. We have also observed this RAT
being downloaded and executed along with MSIL/Crimson by Andromeda downloaders. In addition to Crimson and
Peppy, we have observed the usage of Luminosity Link RAT, njRAT, Bezigate, Meterpreter, and several custom
downloaders.

16

Figure 18: Maltego graph of cluster 1 activity (click here for the complete graph)
The attackers responsible for this activity appear have to used a mixture of compromised infrastructure (e.g., sahirlodhi[.]
com) and infrastructure owned solely by them (e.g., bbmsync2727[.]com). In many cases, the attackers used common
patterns in naming their domains:
•

sync in domain name and file name

•

Repeated use of bb in domain name or filename, mostly bbm

•

Ending second level domain names in four digits

Additionally, this cluster of activity has numerous instances where Contabo GmbH was used for C&C. However we never
used that as a sole item to group activity together under this cluster. Next, we will discuss an additional email attack, the
attachment.biz activity, and lastly the afowoblog.in domain, all of which we believe fall into this cluster.
Email campaign using “2016 Pathankot attack” Lure
While researching this activity, we discovered an additional email attack campaign using the 2016 Pathankot attack as a
lure (Fig. 19). This attack utilized a URL (hxxp://comdtoscc.attachment[.]biz/?att=1451926252) to deliver a compressed
file (md5: f689471d59e779657bc44da308246ac4) containing two MSIL/Crimson payloads using 193.37.152[.]28:9990 as
their C&C.

Figure 19: email campaign using “2016 Pathankot attack” as a lure
The attackers further increased the believability of their attack by including decoy files with each of the MSIL/Crimson
payloads:
Sample 1: 65f6143d69cb1246a117a704e9f07fdc
Original name: “Call Record and Tracking Route.scr”

ATTACHMENT.BIZ domain
We discovered additional activity surrounding the attachment.biz domain that is being used to deliver malicious
documents and payloads. The observed domains include:
•

fileshare.attachment[.]biz

•

comdtoscc.attachment[.]biz

•

ceengrmes.attachment[.]biz

•

email.attachment[.]biz (no links discovered)

All of the domains resolve to the same IP, 91.194.91[.]203 (Contabo GmbH). So far we have detected three separate
campaigns, although we’re unsure of the starting point for each of these incidents but are highly confident they exist in
this cluster of activity.

AFOWOBLOG.IN Domain
We have uncovered circumstantial evidence indicating that the afowoblog.in domain falls into this cluster of activity.
The domain was registered on or near February 24th, 2016 using the email address thefriendsmedia@gmail.com,
which is also close to the same day that the “AFOWO Broucher 2016.xls” attachment was uploaded to VT. We have
detected potentially connected activity as far back as June 2013 using the domain thefriendsmedia[.]com , where it
was used as an Andromeda C&C.
In one instance (Fig. 22, maltego graph), we observed an Andromeda payload communicate with
brooksidebiblefellowship[.]org to retrieve an additional Andromeda payload from lolxone[.]com that then used
thefriendsmedia[.]com as its C&C. The original Andromeda also retrieved a Bezigate payload.

20

Figure 22: thefriendsmedia connection to Andromeda, lolxone[.]com, and Bezigate
Furthermore, we have observed lolxone[.]com hosting additional Bezigate payloads as well as the Python/Peppy
malware as shown in the graph below (Fig. 23). This activity can be further connected to the overall cluster via the Peppy,
Bezigate, and Andromeda C&Cs as shown in the complete Maltego graph (Fig. 25).

21

Figure 23: lolxone[.]com and Andromeda connections to Python/Peppy, Bezigate

Cluster 2 - guddyapps/appstertech/sajid
Some Crimson SecApp modules we came across did not download the expected RAT or downloader payload when it
first communicated to its C&C. For example, sample: 85429d5f2745d813e53b28d3d953d1cd retrieved a downloader
from 178.238.228[.]113:7861 . Once the downloader was executed, it then downloaded an XMPP library (md5:
fee34da6f30a17e1fcc5a49fd0987169) and the XMPP-based Trojan (md5: d3094c89cad5f8d1ea5f0a7f23f0a2b1) we
refer to as Beendoor. Beendoor is a very interesting piece of malware and we were able to gather additional
information about this variant's C&C, 178.238.235[.]143.
Much like Crimson and Peppy, Beendoor is capable of taking screenshots of the victims desktop. On Beendoor’s C&C
we were able to recover a screenshot that appears to have been taken from one of the malware developer’s computer
(Fig. 24). In this modified screenshot we are bringing attention to a few key pieces of information:
•

Identical “Anushka” image on desktop found on Beendoor C&C and used in Beendoor sample

•

Folder structure similar to that found on the C&C

•

Hardcoded paths found in Beendoor dropper binary (md5: 9b98abb9a9fa714e05d43b08b76c0afa)

•

Same file names used by Beendoor and the XMPP library

22

Figure 24: Screenshot of likely Beendoor developer’s desktop
As shown in the figure, it seems likely that the Pakistan-based company Appstertech is somehow connected to the
Beendoor malware. Based on the analysis of the folders and files on the Beendoor C&C, we can also conclude that this
activity is related to research published by CloudSek late last year.
In the Crimson samples that we found connected to Beendoor (Fig. 25), several of them used the same “Binder” dropper
that we observed in other clusters, including Cluster 1. Moreover, the C&C for this occurrence of Crimson and Beendoor
are both hosted at Contabo GmbH, another similarity with other clusters surrounding the Crimson implant.

Figure 25: Maltego graph of Crimson<->Beendoor cluster

Cluster 3 - “Nadra attack in Mardan” Lure

In addition to the attack using the recent Pathankot attack as a lure, we discovered several samples that may have
been used in recent attack campaigns utilizing the December attack in Mardan near a National Database and
Registration Authority (Nadra) as a lure. Several samples were uploaded to VT in compressed archives containing
Crimson payloads along with possible decoys their respective droppers would have dropped. For example,
one of the payloads (md5: 51c57b0366d0b71acf05b4df0afef52f, “NADRA OFC.exe”) was uploaded to VT along
with an image (md5: be0b258e6a419b926fe1cfc04f7e575a) that can also be found here: hxxp://i.dawn[.]com/
medium/2015/12/56825d6d8f1a5.png which is linked to by an article about the attack: hxxp://www.dawn[.]com/
news/1229406
For this cluster of activity, we’re not currently aware of any droppers and so have decided to cluster it on its own. With
that in mind however, the TTPs for this campaign are nearly identical to the “Pathankot attack lure” campaign in Cluster
1. Unsurprisingly, the C&C utilized in this campaign is hosted at Contabo GmbH. Lastly, the port used in these samples,
11100, is the same port used by some of the samples we have grouped in Cluster 1.

Threat Insight | Operation Transparent Tribe

23

Cluster 4 - DDNS and Pakistan
The final cluster we would like to discuss include several samples all using DDNS for their C&C pointing to Pakistan IP
(according to Whois) addresses. The majority of this activity is from 2013. Based on the slightly different TTPs (purely
DDNS usage) and no use of Contabo GmbH, we have clustered this separately from other activity, even though we
have observed DDNS usage in Cluster 1 and the obvious overlap in tool usage. This activity is graphed in Figure 26
and included in the IOCs section.

Figure 26: DDNS and Pakistan IP address Maltego graph

One Cluster to Rule Them All, Nothing Yet to Bind Them...
There are numerous overlaps between the clusters, including usage of the “Binder” dropper, attack lures, and most
obvious, the usage of Contabo GmbH. Unfortunately we lack information regarding some of the found samples as far as
how they were used and in what campaigns, and so we have decided not to tie all the activity together. As we continue to
research these incidents, we would not be surprised to find additional information linking all clusters together.

Technical Analysis
MSIL/Crimson
Crimson is modular in the sense that additional payloads downloaded by the main RAT module are often utilized to
perform functions such as keylogging and browser credential theft. Crimson infections also typically occur in stages.
Crimson’s first stage is a downloader component whose primary purpose is to download a more fully featured RAT,
typically being the Crimson RAT component. The RAT component will then send system information to the C&C while the
C&C will likely respond with additional module payloads.
Crimson utilizes a custom TCP protocol for communicating to C&C (Fig. 27). Some of Crimson’s optionally downloaded
modules have no C&C capability and instead rely on the RAT component for information exfiltration.

Figure 27: Crimson custom TCP C&C protocol

24
Crimson-infected victims may be spied on by their attackers via invasive methods such as through their webcam,
stealing email from Outlook, and recording their screen. Some Crimson RAT variants support at least 40 individual
commands, while all the individual commands throughout the different versions of the RAT we researched are listed and
described in Table 1.

MSIL/Crimson Module Analysis

As previously mentioned (and shown in the commands table), Crimson relies on additional module payloads to further
enrich its feature set. These modules include keylogging, browser credential theft, automatic searching and stealing of
files on removable drives, and two different payload update modules. Lastly, there appears to be a module referred to as
“remvUser” that we have not been able to locate.
URLDownload
When executed, this module will first check for the existence of a registry key: HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\
CurrentVersion\last_edate . If the key does not exist then it will be created by the module and assigned a DateTime.Now
string. This key is periodically checked for how many days have passed. Once the malware detects that at least 15 days
have passed, a HTTP GET request is sent to a hardcoded location to retrieve a text file that should point to another HTTP
location containing a final payload. For example, one analyzed sample (md5: 532013750ee3caac93a9972103761233)
contained a hardcoded URL: hxxp://sahirlodhi[.]com/usr/api.txt. So far we have observed the attackers modify api.txt
twice, first containing a link to: hxxp://bbmsync2727[.]com/upd/secure_scan.exe and then: hxxp://bbmsync2727[.]com/

26
ccmb/ssm.exe .
In the module that we analyzed, the downloader logic was configured to request a file from a hardcoded URL: hxxp://
sahirlodhi[.]com/usr/api.txt , which is likely a compromised website. The module expects that another URL will be stored
at the previously retrieved URL, which initially we found to be the following: hxxp://bbmsync2727[.]com/upd/secure_scan.
exe (md5: e456d6035e41962a4e49345b00393dcd). This payload is a MSIL/Crimson Downloader variant that, when
executed, will begin the MSIL/Crimson lifecycle all over again by downloading a new controller/orchestrator.
secApp
The secApp that we analyzed (md5: ccfd8c384558c5a1e09350941faa08ab) contained functionality very similar to the
initial downloader, however the initial beacon that is sent to the C&C was doupdat rather than updatc and was configured
to connect to the same hardcoded C&C but to a different port. In addition to supporting the updatc command issued by
the C&C, this module also supports the following commands: info, upsecs, and upmain. The info command supports the
same functionality that the main RAT module supports while upsecs and upmain allows the controller to modify the path
and application names for both the secApp and mainApp.
Credential Stealer
The pssApp is a password harvesting module that initially appears to support retrieving saved credentials from the
Chrome, Firefox, and Opera browsers. Successfully harvested credentials are stored in a hardcoded location such as:
%APPDATA%\Roaming\chrome\chrome_update . If no credentials are found, the credential log will simply contain “Not
Found> > <” while an example of successfully stolen credentials are shown in Figure xx. In our very limited testing, this
module was not able to retrieve passwords from Opera 35.0.2066.68 or Firefox 44.0.2 but was successful with Chrome
48.0.2564.116 m.

Figure 28: Successfully harvested credentials by the pssApp module
Some samples (md5: 8a991eec65bd90f12450ee9dac0f286a) also appear to support the retrieval of credentials from
Windows Live, FileZilla, Vitalwerks’ Dynamic Update Client (DUC), and Paltalk.
Keylogger
The keylogger module is a basic keylogger that stores keylogs in a plain text file (Fig. 29) in a hardcoded location. The
module that we analyzed (md5: f18172d7bb8b98246cb3dbb0e9144731) was hardcoded to store keylogs in a file named
“nvidia” in the following location: %APPDATA%\NVIDIA\ .

27
USB Module
If either the updatu or usbwrm commands are issued, a USB drive module may be downloaded and set to execute
on next startup. In the payload that we analyzed, the purpose only appears to search for potentially interesting files in
removable storage and copy them to the local disk, likely so they may be exfiltrated at a later time. This payload may
be configured with a set of file extensions (Fig 30) that are used to search for matching files on any USB drives. If any
files are found, they are copied to a configured directory on the local disk while a running list of copied files are stored
in a separate log so duplicate files are not copied. The anti-duplication method, however, only utilizes filenames so in
the event that an already copied file is later modified, a newer copy will not be saved for exflitration. Despite one of the
commands that may be used to download this payload may indicate this payload to contain “worm” functionality, that
does not appear to be the case.
remvUser
During our research, we were not able to locate this module; so we are not sure what its functionality is. A best guess is
that it could be a clean-up/implant removal utility.
Python/Peppy
Peppy is a Python-based RAT with the majority of its appearances having similarities or definite overlap with MSIL/
Crimson appearances. Peppy communicates to its C&C over HTTP and utilizes SQLite for much of its internal
functionality and tracking of exfiltrated files. The primary purpose of Peppy may be the automated exfiltration of
potentially interesting files and keylogs. Once Peppy successfully communicates to its C&C, the keylogging and
exfiltration of files using configurable search parameters begins (Fig. 30). Files are exfiltrated using HTTP POST requests
(Fig. 31).

Figure 30: Peppy configurable search parameters

Figure 31: Peppy exfiltrating files

28
In addition to keylogging and the exfiltration of files, Peppy is also capable of accepting commands from its C&C to
update itself, disable itself, exfiltrate a specific file, uninstall itself, execute a shell command, take screenshots, spawn a
reverse shell, and download a remote file and execute it.
In addition, we have discovered a simple Python-based downloader (md5: 82719f0f6237d3efb9dd67d95f842013) that
was possibly written by the author(s) of Peppy based on code overlap between the downloader’s functionality and
Peppy’s download_exec routine (Fig. 32, 33).

Conclusion
As we described, there are clearly a number of common threads throughout these attacks. We have been able to
connect campaigns, vectors, payloads, and, in some cases, infrastructure, but additional details continue to emerge.
In the short term, this serves as an important reminder that wars are no longer waged solely on the ground or in the
air. Rather, threat actors (whether from nation-states or private parties with interests in international conflicts) will use a
variety of cyber tools to achieve their goals.
