Bitdefender researchers recently stumbled across 13 Google Play applications packing
aggressive ads and potentially using over 1,000 fake reviews to gain a cumulative
download count of over half of million.
While fake online reviews may be punishable by the FTC with millions of dollars, it’s
interesting that, while some of the analyzed apps only got a dozen or so reviews, one in
particular has even passed 1,000 reviews. Ironically, the developer behind the apps seems
to be taking an interest in negative and very emotional reviews of three stars and below,
even though many of the answers follow the same template. Taking things to a new level,
some of the five-star reviews even collect over 100 “Helpful” ratings, potentially from the
same fake accounts – spam bot- network.

2/20

It may not be the first time security researchers stumble across Google Play applications
with aggressive adware that manage to trick their way into Google’s app playground, but
this time the developer behind the applications seems to have placed more focus on
building positive fake reviews to draw downloads. Apps bundled with aggressive adware
are often spotted by users and end up collecting tons of negative reviews before being
booted out.
The below analysis performed by Bitdefender researchers on the 13 apps found in Google
Play mostly focuses on the capabilities the aggressive adware features as well as finding
forensic evidence that potentially ties them all to a single developer. The analysis also
revealed that the adware SDK packs a privacy-intrusive permission that allows the apps to
read all notifications. This could enable the developer(s) to collect contact details, text
messages, and OTPs that are used to pass MFA. Although the apps analyzed did not
trigger the permission, the code is present in some of the analyzed samples.

Key Findings:
New aggressive adware family, also found in 13 Google Play apps
Use of fake reviews and ratings to attract hundreds of thousands of downloads
Adware SDK packs privacy-intrusive permission to read all notifications
Potentially same developer behind all investigated Google Play apps

Down the Rabbit Hole
A previously undiscovered yet highly aggressive adware campaign has recently been found
in applications still available in the Google Store and other markets.
3/20

The apps’ categories are a mix of common utility apps, ranging from music and video
players to file downloaders and social media aggregators.
While ads are not inherently bad, and give the app authors a way to make income without
requesting a payment from everyone who uses their apps, when the developers go
overboard with their ad usage it becomes inconvenient to the user, eventually surpassing
the worth of the application in time and annoyance.
Whilst the ratings are generally good, between 3 and 4.5 stars on Google Play’s 5-star
rating system, something seems fishy with a quick look at the reviews:

A high number of short, general and mostly 5-star reviews usually indicates that the app
developers might be using a fake review-generation system. While this is only speculation,
the act of faking reviews is punishable by the FTC, and fines can reach millions of dollars.
This is a known problem for Google Play and these apps would be neither the first nor the
last apps to increase their chances of getting popular more quickly and easily. After all, if
most reviews are great, it must mean the app is worth it:

A quick look at the reviews of users who actually used the application before leaving a
comment reflects its real behavior much better:

The applications are published by nine separate developers although we believe there is in
fact only one developer due to several connections between the samples. One presumption
is that this is done to avoid all of them being taken down if any fraudulent or unwanted
behavior from any one developer is found.

Some light connections could be concluded from the email addresses for support contact
and the privacy policies. All the privacy policies are hosted on sites.google.com and we
can observe a mild pattern in the email addresses used..
From a code structural point of view, the applications have the same distinct, heavy code
obfuscation and string encryption mechanism. This obfuscation is applied both to the
normal code of the application and to the adware component.
The adware component, present in all apps in some form or another, focuses on displaying
ads from Google and Facebook. We say in some form or another to indicate that the
authors are still developing it and adding new features to it. We have seen several
variations in the wild.
Another similarity is in the user interface of the apps. Many of them share the same visual
characteristics and structure, for example:

7/20

com.media.musicsvideos.players com.musics.videos.aaplayers (developer: luis gallegos)
(developer: Laverneishipwreckm115)com.anymail com.privacymsger.social (developer:
Steps Pedometer:Steps App, Step Tracker) (developer: Socialmessengerapp)
Behavior
While interacting with the applications, the user will receive a new ad every few taps. Some
older versions of the apps didn’t even find the time to remove their testing tags in their rush
to get on the market. The type of ads varies from general topics such as shopping and
travel to app recommendations, and they come both in banner and full-screen modes.

8/20

The advertised functionality of the apps is generally lacking. Basic at best and broken at
worst, the apps are of inferior quality, with missing parts in their implementation and
occasional crashes.

Code Analysis

9/20

Our analysis focused mostly on APK MD5 dcb5b8d8270b4a51a7702fa716ff9bc2
(launchserfor.apps), given that it presented most of the features of the SDK and is one of
the versions currently available on the Play Store.
The code is heavily obfuscated, and strings used by the app are encrypted using DES
encryption algorithm. Virtually nothing is left as plain information and some of the classes
are hidden even in legit packages such as android.support and com.facebook . This
started as a technique to protect intellectual information but nowadays it’s often misused as
a way to delay analysts and avoid effective detections.

10/20

Interestingly, in an initial test version of the adware, we found that the threat actors might
have planned to confuse the user by switching the position of the “agree” and “refuse”
buttons when prompting for access to notifications (the strings have been decrypted here).

This SDK version (among others) has the code to ask for the permission to read all
notifications. This is one of the most sensitive permissions the Android system provides,
since notifications can contain any type of data, from contact details, to text messages to
OTPs that are used to pass MFA – even banking data in some cases. However, none of the
samples we analyzed reach the code to do so as of yet.
If this part of the code wasn’t dead, however, the inconvenience of the user who is the
target of too many ads is suddenly one of the lesser problems since, once received, the
notifications are promptly sent to the APK’s command and control server: in this case,
hxxps://t.lineranalysis.com/api/APClient3/.
The service androidx.media.ckwtik extends the NotificationListenerServices class
belonging to the Android SDK. If the app has the required permission, overwriting the
onNotificationPosted(StatusBarNotification) method will give it access to the
device’s notifications and related information. The analyzed app never reaches the part of
the code that requests the permission from the user (probably due to the app still being in
development). However, if, or when, it reaches that part, it will use it to leak all the
notification data to the server.

11/20

12/20

Two of the apps currently up on Play Store have this type of functionality implemented,
namely com.forasocial.messengers and launchserfor.apps .
Another interesting part of the SDK is where it provides a large support for JavaScript.
Besides having a class dedicated to exposing functionality through JavaScript interfaces, it
goes so far as having the functionality to execute any script received from the server.
(Some of the strings have been decrypted for readability.)

13/20

The app also sends generic information to the server, such as the list of installed
applications, the device’s android ID, the app’s package name, the type of network, the sim
operator, whether the current app has certain functionalities implemented, logs, timestamps
and status checks.

Attribution
While we cannot be certain of the origin of the developer(s), most privacy pages for each
developer have their tab title in Chinese (either 首页 -Homepage or住宅 – Home).

Many debug messages (logs) inside the applications are also in the same language (e.g.
“因未调用setApplicationContext()初始化, 当前不支持Cookie”) and all of the CnCs are
registered in China.
Telemetry

The family seems to be most popular in India, Korea and the US, although we have seen it
in the wild in many other countries, too.

Conclusions
Aggressive adware may not be as damaging or as intrusive as malware, but it could affect
the overall user experience with the device and even battery performance. Constant
popups, redirects and unwanted messages can make for a horrendous app and user
experience.

16/20

To avoid exposing your device to any online threats, malware, or even aggressive adware,
it’s recommended you always use a security solution to prevent these apps from reaching
your device and to flag any suspicious behavior. It’s also important to always download
apps from official marketplaces and read user reviews carefully before installing any
application on your mobile device.
A mobile security solution will also keep you safe from online threats, such as fraud,
phishing, or scams gunning for your private and financial data, as well as from malware.
Note: The full list of apps identified throughout this investigation has been reported to
Google. At the time of writing, the apps are still available in the Google Play store.
