Introduction
With organizations increasingly using cloud environments for scaling and
accelerating operations, understanding the unique cyber threat landscape
of this field is critical. Leveraging IBM’s global presence and cloud incident
response capabilities, we have conducted an in-depth analysis of cloud-related
cybersecurity incidents our team has responded to over the past year in order to
discern the top threats in this arena. This paper will dive into what IBM Security
sees on the front lines of defending the cloud, including:
— Who is targeting cloud systems
— How we’re seeing threat actors access cloud environments
— What threat actors are doing once they have gained access
to a cloud environment
— Common shortcomings we observe in cloud security
— Recommendations for improving your organization’s cloud
security posture

Key findings
Financial gain is the most common motivation of threat actors
targeting cloud environments, based on IBM Security Incident
Response data collected since 2019.1

45%

Bruteforcing and exploitation of cloud applications are the two
most common infection vectors, accounting for 45% of the cases
examined in this report.

Data theft—such as appropriation of personally identifiable
information (PII)—is the favored activity of cybercriminals
once they penetrate a cloud environment.

>1 billion

Misconfiguration of cloud environments
led to over one billion lost records in 2019.

Ransomware is the most commonly deployed malware in
infiltrated cloud environments, accounting for three times as
many cases as cryptomining and botnet malware, which follow
in second and third place respectively.

Key findings
Leveraging cloud platforms for use as malicious infrastructure
is often a favorite ploy of sophisticated threat actors, enabling
them to ramp up operations with a single compromise. This has
the added appeal of allowing them to minimize their own costs
at the expense of their targets and appear to originate from
otherwise legitimate sources.

Losses of
>$50,000/hr

Depending on the organization impacted
and the type of applications run in the
cloud, infiltration can bring this swift and
hefty price tag.

Redeploy assets, don’t reimage them: Organizations that
redeploy assets vs. reimage affected cloud environments are
more capable of performing effective forensic investigations,
which may prevent subsequent harm to the organization.

Defense-in-depth is a necessity: Malware developers, aware
of increasing cloud adoption, have begun making malware that
disables many common cloud security products, leaving many
companies unknowingly vulnerable.

Section 1

Cloud computing: significant
security benefits, but risks
must be addressed
Cloud computing, the delivery of on-demand computing resources over
the internet on a pay-per-use basis, provides a host of security benefits to
organizations looking to expand their computing capability across the enterprise.
While most enterprises today are approximately 20 percent into their transition
to the cloud, as companies continue modernizing their core IT infrastructure
and moving mission-critical data and apps to the cloud, organizations must also
adapt to the unique cybersecurity challenges and opportunities posed by these
new hybrid, multi-cloud environments.
There are key terms that need clarification when discussing cloud security,
as these terms often come up while organizations work to secure their
cloud-based assets.

Public cloud
A cloud environment hosted external to an organization.
Private cloud
A cloud environment hosted and maintained within an organization for their private use.
Hybrid cloud
Having clouds that are integrated and holistically managed — both on- and off-premises
and across different clouds.
Containerization
Containers are an executable unit of software in which application code is packaged,
along with its libraries and dependencies, in common ways so that it can be run
anywhere, whether it be on desktop, traditional IT, or the cloud.

Cloud Threat Landscape Report 2020

Corporate IT environments are getting increasingly complex as businesses
incorporate cloud elements and need to manage their hybrid multicloud
infrastructure in a way that is simple, consistent and integrated. But the
architecture is not where it ends. Security threats inherent to the cloud’s
hyper-connected nature must be assessed and addressed as data and
operations are moved to the cloud. Understanding the cloud security threat
landscape can help organizations better protect themselves and prepare for
potential security events.

Thinking about risk
As a result of increased cloud integration across enterprises, cloud-to-cloud
interactions allow potential infections to spread across an enterprise even faster
than on-premise attacks would and the vast amounts of data running in clouds
can also increase the amount of data that threat actors could potentially steal.
With data breach costs tightly linked with the number of records breached, cloud
security incidents can be costly. Another aspect that can quickly add up costs is
unauthorized access to cloud assets. Depending on the type of operation being
breached, that access can easily generate losses of over $50,000 within less
than one hour.

Unauthorized access to cloud assets can lead to

losses of >$50,000 in less
than an hour.
Clouds are a new era for many organizations and securing them, addressing data
privacy concerns, regulation and compliance, all demand a new and adapted
approach with best practices that can differ from managing classic IT security.

Section 2

Who is targeting cloud systems?
IBM Security has observed multiple types of groups targeting cloud systems
through our IBM X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Services (IRIS)
incident response team, and working with our colleagues at DarkOwl, we’ve
found even more interested parties on the deep web and dark web. Per our
finding, financially motivated criminals are the top threat, but nation state
actors are also a persistent risk.

Financially motivated criminals are the top threat
group targeting cloud systems, but nation state actors
are also a persistent risk.

Criminal cloud targeting
The most frequently observed threat actor category targeting cloud
environments was cybercriminals, according to X-Force IRIS incident response
data. Financially motivated threat actors were rarely associated with a specific
group or organization, but rather simply trying to gain access to cloud assets in
opportunistic attacks, oftentimes automating their attempts to cast a wide net.
Further research done in collaboration with DarkOwl, a darknet data intelligence
company, reveals a thriving market for cloud-targeted services and accounts on
underground forums and markets.

Cloud Threat Landscape Report 2020

8

Key offerings in the underground ecosystem include cloud service accounts at
reduced prices. For example, one Russian-language forum featured vendors
offering an unlimited monthly service for a large public cloud service that was
cheaper than the public sale price. In another case, a different group of actors
was observed selling access keys to another large public cloud service for as
little as $15 each. These types of services can allow threat actors to use cloud
infrastructure for their malicious activities under accounts that would otherwise
appear legitimate.
Criminals also offer assistance in penetrating specific cloud-hosted accounts.
On a platform that connects English and Russian speaking hackers, a user
posted a link to a bypass utility to access personal accounts on a large public
cloud platform. Another offering detailed the steps for exploiting a public cloud
service’s ID and included a script the hacker was selling on the forum. Another
market offering observed in dark and deep web venues is the sale of cloud
computing resources. Cloud provider access is sold to those wanting to host
phishing sites, for example. In one case we observed a hacking forum member
express their plans to host phishing pages on a public cloud environment that
mimicked a product offered by the cloud provider.
Similar to legitimate online learning courses, there are multiple tutorials on
how to use cloud computing credits or stolen credit cards to open accounts on
popular cloud services, to then use them for malicious purposes.

Nation state attacks
Nation state threat actors have an established record of targeting cloud
environments for financial gain and espionage purposes. Threat groups often
target cloud environments extensively in an effort to access connected thirdparty systems.
As more sensitive data moves into cloud environments, we expect espionagefocused threat groups to continue targeting cloud environments to achieve their
strategic intelligence objectives.

Section 3

How threat actors compromise
cloud environments
Like any network, cloud environments can be targeted in a variety of ways, some
of which are unique to cloud but many of which affect systems across the board.
The IBM Security threat intelligence team leveraged X-Force IRIS’s incident
response data to find the most common ways we see threat actors targeting
cloud environments. In many cases, threat actors use more than one of
the following mechanisms to gain, maintain, and spread access, as well as
escalate their access permissions inside the same cloud and on potentially
connected clouds.

Exploitation of cloud applications
The most common infection vector we observed in cloud environments from
January 2019 to May 2020 was remote exploitation of cloud applications,
accounting for 45 percent of the cloud-related cybersecurity events examined.
While agile and scalable, cloud-based applications can open up a broad avenue
for threat actors. Since these applications are also often necessary for business
operations, they are a key target for threat activity.

Over the past two years, IBM Security has responded to multiple incidents
where vulnerable applications were present in the environment but remained
undetected. Sometimes that is due to lack of security maturity in the cloud,
and often it can also be due to “shadow IT,” where an employee goes outside
approved channels to use cloud capabilities, opts to use a vulnerable cloud
application, and thereby puts the entire environment at risk.
Addressing remote vulnerabilities in cloud environments has been challenging,
in part due to the lack of public cataloging of discovered issues. Until 2020,
vulnerabilities in cloud products were outside the scope of traditional CVEs,
meaning that vulnerabilities related to cloud infrastructure were rarely publicly
disclosed or recorded over time. As a result, cloud environments may have
been more vulnerable than previously realized, harboring a variety of
unaddressed issues.

Misconfiguration exploitation
Based on data from IBM’s 2020 X-Force Threat Intelligence Index, threat
actors took advantage of misconfigured cloud servers to siphon over 1 billion
records from compromised environments in 2019. Misconfiguration of cloud
environments and subsequent data leaks remains one of the greatest sources of
record loss across the board and can quickly allow a threat actor to access and
steal sensitive information from organizations where that sort of oversight may
affect assets in the cloud.

Cross-cloud compromise
Threat actors can sometimes breach cloud environments by infecting one cloud
environment, then use the trusted connection to move laterally to other clouds
and infect additional environments.
This cross-cloud compromise can be especially insidious, as cloud
environments, especially large public clouds, often have high volumes of
communication and can make this type of infection more difficult to detect.
In one X-Force IRIS incident response, threat actors were detected when larger
than normal amounts of data were observed being transferred between clouds
that were designated for different geographies. This type of attack allowed the
threat actors to quickly move between large data repositories and cause harm
throughout the target’s enterprise while evading many detection mechanisms,
hiding their activity in the overall operational activity.

Swimming upstream
In another type of vector, we have observed threat actors attempting to gain
privileged access to cloud repositories by getting onto the underlying hardware.
This “swimming upstream” technique requires threat actors to gain initial
access to the cloud environment, then access the underlying host, then down
to the management system to move between client environments. Swimming
upstream can sometimes mask threat actor activity as legitimate administration,
since administration often needs to move data between instances as well,
so distinguishing between the two can be complex. This technique was on
display when the severe Perfect 10.0 vulnerability was disclosed in 2020. That
flaw allowed for a threat actor to break hardware-based isolation in a cloud
environment, making them able to intercept code, manipulate programs, and
otherwise affect other users’ activities hosted on the same hardware. That flaw
was since fixed.

Section 4

How threat actors are using the
cloud to cause harm
While there are many theoretical techniques to cause harm once in a cloud
environment, IBM Security has observed threat actors using a variety of
traditional attack tactics to profit from this new technology’s increased
capabilities.
Ransomware, data theft, and cryptomining lead the way in harming organizations
while leveraging clouds. However, hosting malware and scam sites on cloud
environments, or leveraging access to worm into other clouds, has enabled
actors to cause broader damage outside the organization’s own scope,
compounding the potential risk to connected parties as well.

Ransomware
In X-Force IRIS incident response cases we analyzed from 2019 and 2020,
ransomware was by far the most common type of malware deployed in the
cloud, representing three times as many incidents as any other malware.

Ransomware was used 3x
as much as any other malware deployed in the cloud,
based on IBM incident response cases studied.

Cloud Threat Landscape Report 2020

13

Unlike ransomware attacks on traditional networked endpoints, ransomware in
the cloud can have a more disruptive impact and cause greater data loss. That
can be due to the wider range of operations supported by cloud environments,
their potential impact on critical applications, and the sheer amount of data
moving through clouds every day.
In a ransomware incident to which X-Force IRIS responded, the infection
resulted from a gap in cloud administration responsibilities between the
infrastructure provider and their client. That gap potentially allowed the
compromise to go undetected longer, increasing the cost to the organization,
and highlighting the criticality of defining cloud security roles for both the
provider and the client.

Data theft
Cloud environments host large troves of information, and this data can be stolen
by threat actors and sold on underground marketplaces. From incidents that
IBM X-Force IRIS has handled, we’ve seen that the types of data stolen can
vary. For example, we observed threat actors stealing sensitive PII, including
credit card numbers, from a breach of cloud data. In a different incident,
we observed threat actors potentially stealing client-related emails from a
compromised cloud.

Data theft was the second most common threat
activity IBM X-Force observed in breached cloud
environments in 2019.

The type of data stolen can vary based on threat actor motivations and
sophistication, but in cloud environments, the amount of data available can be
much greater, making the potential impact of a breach that much more damaging
to the organization.

Cloud Threat Landscape Report 2020

14

Cryptomining
When it comes to illicit cryptomining threats, especially those leveraging scaled
infrastructure like clouds, IBM X-Force IRIS has seen multiple instances of
threat actors using cloud environments to mine for cryptocurrency over the
last year.
In one case in 2019, X-Force IRIS responded to an incident where a cloud server
was infected with a cryptominer that subsequently attempted to spread laterally
to connected machines. This sort of compromise can have a few impacts: for onprem cloud environments, the organization can incur increased electricity costs
and faster degradation of hardware components as well as performance impact
that can be rather meaningful in industries like the financial sector.
With external/public clouds, the organization could face increased charges due
to higher data usage or slower response times as processing power is reduced.
In all cases, cryptomining is a drain on organizational resources and can hinder
business operations.

Hosting malware or malicious sites
Threat actors can use infected cloud environments to host malware that can
subsequently spread onto other environments. For example, in late 2019,
criminals were hosting a payment card skimmer on a cloud platform, which
was subsequently downloaded onto targeted machines. In another case, threat
actors hosted over 200 tech support scam sites on one cloud instance, directing
users to these sites and using the cloud environment to lend their attack an
air of legitimacy.
Hosting malware or malicious sites on cloud environments can help threat actors
avoid network blocks by appearing as callouts to legitimate infrastructure.
Also, the use of cloud hosting can provide threat actors with a layer of
abstraction, making campaign activity more difficult to track. If an organization
is unknowingly hosting malware on its cloud, especially for extended periods of
time, this can lead to both direct and reputational harm as the organization may
lose data itself and also be accused of allowing this activity to persist.

Cloud Threat Landscape Report 2020

15

DNS compromise
IBM X-Force IRIS observed multiple incidents in which threat actors
compromised cloud-hosted DNS services to redirect employees to
different sites.
Playing on the DNS cache poisoning concept, this insidious attack method
leverages existing cloud access to cause further harm to an organization and
can be difficult for users to detect. This type of compromise can redirect users
to sites that attempt to exploit their browsers and drop a malicious payload
onto endpoint machines, or it could redirect them to phishing sites to steal their
network credentials. In some cases, redirection to advertisements, or clickfraud, is set up to line the pockets of criminals.
While DNS compromise is not a new attack, as organizations continue to shift
these services to an external cloud provider, threat actors can find new
avenues for potential compromise, and the impact could expand throughout
the organization.

Lateral spread
Threat actors have used a variety of methods to expand from an initial infection
into other parts of the cloud environment or on to endpoint boxes that access
cloud resources. In 2019, IBM X-Force IRIS responded to an incident in
which malware deployed to a cloud environment attempted to spread to other
machines via SSH bruteforcing, affecting external local machines accessing
the cloud.
Also in 2019, the Exim worm, a Linux worm spreading via Exim servers, was
reportedly spreading infection automatically via remote exploitation of CVE
2019-10149. The worm would take over a server with the goal of dropping a
cryptojacking malware onto it.
This type of lateral spread can compound the impact of a cloud infection and
bring it into an organization’s internal network space.

Section 5

Cloud-native malware and
its evolution
Many cloud-based systems run the same operating systems and applications
as their on-premise counterparts, and as a result, much of the malware found
operating in cloud environments is the same as that found outside of the cloud.
However, there are instances of malware which are specifically designed to
either target or make use of cloud systems.

These malware variants fall into three groups:
— Malware that uses clouds to scale
— Malware adapting to cloud environments
— Malware using cloud environments for operational infrastructure

Malware that uses clouds to scale
By targeting cloud applications or platforms specifically, malware operators
can quickly ramp up operations and potentially gain significant profits with
a single compromise. One example of a malware family adapting to the new
cloud reality is DemonBot, a Linux-based bot which was reported in October
2018. DemonBot targets cloud servers running Hadoop and infects them via a
vulnerability in Hadoop’s resource management tool.

Cloud Threat Landscape Report 2020

17

X-Force IRIS investigated an instance of DemonBot found in a cloud
environment which was detected by the affected organization due to a
significant increase in billing and resource usage. In that case, the DemonBot
binaries’ primary function was to launch distributed denial of service (DDoS)
attacks as part of a botnet. With the addition of cloud-targeting capability,
malware operators are able to amplify these attacks using cloud resources.
Another malware family that has found use in organizations’ cloud adoption is
Graboid, a cryptomining worm identified in October 2019. This malware targeted
and compromised unsecured Docker hosts, onto which it downloaded malicious
Docker containers. The malicious containers performed cryptomining and also
spread the malware to other hosts.
In June 2019, researchers reported on an attack campaign which also targeted
misconfigured Docker hosts in order to infiltrate them. In this case, it was a
Linux botnet malware known as AESDDoS that exploited API misconfigurations
to deploy the malware on vulnerable containers. This malware was then able
to receive commands from a command control server and launch a variety of
DDoS attacks.

Malware adapting to cloud environments
During the last two years, researchers at Intezer have observed a significant
increase in the number of cyber-attacks targeting Linux servers, mostly in cloud
environments. The Linux operating system accounts for nearly 90 percent of all
cloud servers.
One example of a threat actor that uses malware to target clouds is the
Chinese-affiliated Pacha Group. This group has been targeting cloud-based
infrastructures with new, previously undetected malware variants of Linux.
GreedyAntd, which shares significant amounts of code with previous variants.
Another malware targeting Linux-based file storage systems (NAS servers) in
cloud environments is the QNAPCrypt ransomware. This sort of threat can affect
a very large user base and affect damage on troves of data hosted in the cloud.
As cloud environments continue to increase in popularity, Linux-focused
malware is likely to continue to grow.

Cloud Threat Landscape Report 2020

18

Malware using cloud environments for operational infrastructure
Just as organizations scale up operations, malware distributors, especially
those linked with organized crime and nation state attacks, can opt to scale their
operations as well. X-Force IRIS has observed threat actors leveraging cloud
environments for their malware operations in a variety of ways.
One investigation of RokRat, a remote access tool (RAT) observed to target
victims in South Korea and attributed to ITG10 (AKA APT37, Scarcruft), used
legitimate, commercial cloud storage services for hosting payloads and C2
communications. This use of cloud services for infrastructure can be difficult to
detect, as organizations’ networks can have significant cloud communication as
part of normal operations and whitelist legitimate providers. By hosting malware
in that sort of a cloud environment, detection of malicious payload downloads
can also be more challenging.
Much like RokRat, Karae is another backdoor attributed to ITG10, which is also
known to use cloud storage providers for C2 communications. In Karae samples
analyzed by X-Force IRIS, a legitimate cloud storage service provider was used
by the threat actors to host the malware, with account credentials hardcoded
into the malware’s binaries. Karae gathers information about the victim’s system
and writes it to a file, which it then uploads to the cloud. It also attempts to
download and execute additional binaries from this service.
This tactic overall presents a detection problem because it can blend in with
normal and legitimate user activity, and it’s also the reason that malware
operators of varying motivations opt to use it.

Section 6

Recommendations to enhance
your cloud security
Responding to a security incident in a cloud environment requires some special
considerations outside of the usual method of incident response. From X-Force
IRIS’s extensive experience in this field, we’ve compiled some key lessons we’ve
learned while preparing for, and responding to, cloud incidents.

Preparing a safer cloud environment
Begin with the end in mind
Before considering moving workloads or data to the cloud, develop a plan as to
its purpose. Build security controls into the conception process and take into the
account the criticality and sensitivity of operations running in the cloud. Consider
using a partner that provides comprehensive security services to help you gain
visibility and control of all aspects of your hybrid cloud security as you develop
your program.
Use proactive simulation
Simulate both expected and unexpected security events within your cloud
environment to understand the effectiveness of your preparation. This
preparation can provide an opportunity to exercise internal playbooks and
standard operating procedures. By focusing on testing and improving both
technical and operational response skills, organizations can move quickly to
remedy issues before damage is done or expands. Furthermore, these exercises
can be augmented with tactical information, such as indicators of compromise
(IOCs), to support a threat intelligence-driven response scenario.

Cloud Threat Landscape Report 2020

20

Prevent policy “dead spots”
With external clouds, the responsibility for protecting cloud environments often
falls on both the organization and the cloud hosting provider. Cloud hosting is
rarely a set-and-forget service, and requires security both on the part of cloud
service providers and the organization using the service. Delineating the role for
each party at the time of negotiating the contract can help define responsibility,
controls, monitoring, and potential liability before an incident. This can help
prevent incidents resulting from policy gaps, as well as allow for more efficient
detection and incident response.
Apply best practices to cloud security
Cloud security does have its own approaches, but they also resemble the
security of other networks in some respects. Organizations therefore need
to apply security best practices to their cloud environments, as clouds are
not immune to compromise. To mitigate the threat of unauthorized access,
implementing multifactor authentication can help prevent infiltration using
stolen credentials.
Privileged account management (PAM) is another important concept in
keeping clouds better protected. Restrict accounts to least-required
privileges to minimize harm from account compromise and consider using
the zero-trust model. By implementing these practices in cloud environments,
organizations can mitigate the risks of incidents or reduce the impact of
potential security events.
Monitor and log
Cloud environments need to be monitored for a variety of matters. From
cloud-sprawl to third party access and unexpected outages, proper monitoring
can help detect malware and the first sign of an attack. Cloud users should
maintain robust logging of events in cloud environment for forensic investigation
of malicious activity. The responsibility of monitoring and logging of cloud events
should be decided by the organization and the cloud hosting provider prior to
starting services to prevent policy dead spots.

Cloud Threat Landscape Report 2020

21

Use threat intelligence to monitor threats
Threat actors continue to evolve and augment their existing arsenal of tactics,
techniques, and procedures with new capabilities specifically to target cloud
environments. As these capabilities continue to develop, organizations should
leverage threat intelligence to monitor changes in targeting and implement
effective defenses.

Responding to cloud security incidents effectively
Don’t reimage, redeploy instead
When organizations terminate their cloud instances, they lose potentially
valuable forensic artifacts. Instead of immediately destroying this data, isolating
affected systems and standing up known clean images could allow forensic
investigators to analyze the infected instance and potentially find additional
leads to understand what went wrong and how to prevent it in the future.
In the case of an incident, build a workstation in the cloud for your investigators
to perform the work on, then create an image from the compromised servers
and collect volatile memory data. Also, doing root cause forensic analysis can
prevent IT administrators from redeploying a tainted base image.
Remember bandwidth costs
One challenge organizations face nowadays is that downloading a large server
image after an incident may be cost prohibitive due to the high bandwidth costs
associated with moving data out of the cloud environment. Having relevant
policies or requirements in place prior to an incident can help reduce the cost of
download, especially when an infection could potentially harm other instances
on the same cloud.

Cloud Threat Landscape Report 2020

22

Have the right investigative tools
Cloud security requires the right tools to conduct a thorough investigation if
something goes wrong. Many common incident response and forensic tools are
only effective in a local environment or an on-premise hosted servers and are
not equipped for a cloud environment. However, preparing the right toolkit can
enable effective cloud investigations.
Moreover, organizations should include cloud assets in their overall incident
response plans and test their cloud security incident response at a tactical level
to ensure that the tools they have are capable of working across all the cloud
environments they use.
Automate incident response
Implementing effective security automation in cloud environments can improve
detection and response capabilities, rather than relying on manually reacting to
events. For example, by following the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach and
using tools such as CloudFormation, declarative approach, and the serverless,
event-driven Lambda services, a compromised organization can efficiently
rebuild the environment from a predefined template. This methodology can lead
to accelerated recovery during ransomware or destructive cyber-attacks against
that environment.

Cloud Threat Landscape Report 2020

23

Conclusion
For those who contract their infrastructure from a vendor, cloud security is a
joint effort by both the provider and the user of cloud services. Organizations
that operate in the cloud must be aware of the threats to cloud environments
in order to properly secure their data and services.
IBM X-Force research indicates that threat actors are also keenly aware of
organizations shifting to cloud infrastructure and are evolving accordingly. With
the cost of cloud breaches only continuing to grow, organizations need to take
steps to protect their cloud-based assets. By being proactive and taking the
recommended steps, organizations can better protect themselves as they
move into a cloud-based world.
