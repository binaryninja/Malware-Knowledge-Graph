Malware vaccines can prevent pandemics, yet are rarely
used

Vaccines have distinct advantages over detection based defense mechanisms, so we
developed a vaccine to protect from one of the most notorious ransomware familiesâ€”
STOP/DJVU. But unlike vaccines against biological viruses, malware vaccines are not
particularly common. This article explains why.

Inner workings of malware vaccines
Malware vaccines apply harmless parts of malware to a system to trick malware into
malfunction. It is not a coincidence that the security industry adopted the term vaccine from
medicine because there is a resemblence to medical vaccines which apply inactive or
weakened parts of viruses to a person in oder to protect. But the analogy stops there.
Malware vaccines do not improve the security reponse of the system.
The harmless malware parts that vaccines apply are often so called infection markers.
Malware usually tries not to infect a system twice because this has unintended
consequences. For that reason malware may place infection markers after a successful
infection. If the malware finds such a marker, it will refrain from installing itself again. A
vaccine just places those infection markers without the malware, thus tricking the malware
into thinking it already infected the system (cf. p. 2 [wich12]).
Vaccines can use other things than infection markers, e.g., they may cause an error in the
malware by providing invalid data. Some malware writes data into the registry or into files like
encryption keys, configuration settings, C2C servers. A vaccine may place invalid data that
causes the malware to crash, malfunction or simply not working as intended by the author. A
simple example would be the application of a non-existing C2C server for remotely controlled
malware. One well-described vaccine that crashed previous versions of Emotet with a buffer
overflow is called EmoCrash [quinn20].
In case of the STOP/DJVU ransomware vaccine, the ransomware is tricked into not
encrypting files anymore. Without file encryption there is no leverage to demand a ransom,
thus, the main malicious behavior is disabled by the vaccine.
Another, albeit different case, is the Logout4Shell vaccine by Cybereason. This vaccine is a
benign malware akin toWelchia worm. Benign malware has malware characteristics like
worm-propagation or virus replication, or exploitation, but the payload is meant to fix a
problem. Welchia worm got famous for using the same propagation mechanisms like Blaster
worm to clean Blaster infections as well as patching vulnerable systems. Logout4Shell is
1/4

similar to Welchia because it actively exploits the Log4Shell vulnerability in order to fix the
security hole. The exploitation itself is problematic because the changes can be applied
without consent of the system's owner. Cybereason states in a Bleepingcomputer article that
the benefits outweigh the ethical concerns considering the severety of Log4Shell exploit.

Advantages of vaccines over detection mechanisms

Malware vaccines have some traits in common

with those administered to combat biological infections.
Vaccines have some unique advantages. They are passive, thus, unlike antivirus scanning
they have no performance overhead for the system. Depending on the malware they may
also work on already infected systems by shutting down the malicious behavior of the
dormant infection (p.3 [wich12]). Vaccines also work independently from obfuscation,
packing, polymorphism, metamorphism or similar evasion techniques.
In a study from 2012 at least 59.4% of the malware samples used infection markers (p.4
[wich12]). This study is obviously outdated, but the only one I could find about infection
marker prevalence. I do believe that the magnitude did not change and vaccines could be
developed for a substantial amount of malware families.
Malware vaccines are actively developed by some security companies, e.g., Minerva,
however, compared to other malware protection mechanism like signature based detection
vaccinations seem rather unpopular. Why?
To understand this let's take a look at a specific vaccine first: The STOP/DJVU ransomware
vaccine.

STOP/DJVU ransomware vaccine
STOP/DJVU ransomware vaccine was created by John Parol and me. We published a tool
on Github so that everyone can inspect and use it. Soon after publishing it, the tool got many
false positive detections by antivirus vendors.

Additionally we added a section to our tool's readme to explain that systems are not entirely
protected from STOP/DJVU ransomware after using this vaccine. The ransomware will still
do things to the system that are not tied to encryption.
in some cases the ransomware may still create ransom notes
if files are smaller than 6 bytes, the ransomware will still rename them, but not change
their contents
this ransomware is often not alone but ships with additional malware like Vidar stealer,
so disinfection of the affected system is still necessary despite the vaccine
So the only thing that the vaccine prevents is the encryption and (for most files) renaming. It
is not sure that the vaccine stays on the system because security products will likely remove
it. STOP/DJVU ransomware itself may also get an update at some point so that the vaccine
does not work anymore.

Vaccines are no silver bullet
The main problem of vaccines is that they make a system look infected to other security
products. Many of the more tech-savvy users use malware scanners additionally to their
main antivirus product and these scanners detect infection markers as a sign of a prevalent
infection. Not only do they remove these infection markers, they will find them repeatedly
when the antivirus product re-applies them. That turns using the products alongside each
other into an unpleasant experience for the user, who may come to believe that their main
antivirus does not work against this threat, and that their system is never properly cleaned.

3/4

Forcing malware scanners to not detect such infection markers is a bad idea because this
would eventually weaken their detection against real threats. These markers are actual
infection signs and should continue to be detected as such. Hoping and preaching that users
only use one security suite from one vendor is also not realistic. We have to live with crossusage of other scanners.
Additionally vaccine protection is oftentimes silent, which means users will never know that
there was an infection attempt. This is not desireable because users need to know that, e.g.,
the program they downloaded was a bad idea.
Malware vaccines may stay a niche defense mechanism for the everyday malware, but they
are specifically useful to combat pandemic outbreaks. In that regard they are not different to
medical vaccines.
