The Operations of Winnti Group
Threat Detection NTT Ltd.

1.

Overview
Threat actor Winnti Group tracked by NTT Security Threat Intelligence analysts as
Entity-1 (ENT-1) is a highly active group with many parallel operations mainly
targeted towards entities in Asia. The definition and classification of activity originating
from the Winnti group diverge between various security companies, what we label as
ENT-1 in this report overlaps activity classified by ESET and Dr Web as Winnti group
in recent reporting [1][2][5].
The aim of this report is to offer a glimpse into the continuous Threat Intelligence
efforts NTT Security are committed to on behalf of our clients, while also reporting on
previously unreported aspects of the EN T-1 group in contribution to the securitycommunities effort of laying the puzzle of ENT-1 activity.
This research has been possible by harnessing NTT’s owned and operated global tier1 IP backbones, together with correlation of data from targeted customers, internal
research and open source intelligence (OSINT).
The timespan of this research is from December 2020 to April 2021 where the
following countries and regions has been observed as targets:

Daily operations
Analysis of traffic towards ENT-1 infrastructure shows that the group is active during
office-hours in time zone UTC+6. Weekends normally lack any activity implying that
the group is truly a full-time funded APT group.

Figure 2 Intensity of ENT-1 activity in UTC+6

The groups daily operations include the exploitation of servers running the GlassFish
Server software version 3.1.2 and below as means for easy infrastructure expansion.
The exploited servers are then utilized during their operations:

Figure 1 ENT-1 GlassFish Workflow

Commonly deployed software includes the Web Vulnerability Scanner Acunitex and
the command-and-control product CobaltStrike.

Acunitex activity
The web vulnerability scanning activity covers geographical sectors and industries
typically associated with the ENT-1 interest sphere. Our observation is a strong focus
on the Media sector located in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan. Travel and

Transportation companies operating out of Hong Kong. Government infrastructure in
Australia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Vietnam, Japan and Macao. Universities and telecom
operators in Bahrain and Kuwait have also been targeted.

Figure 3 Targeted industries
While the scanning is targeted in respect to sector and geographical location it also
appears to be opportunistic. Organisations which have been scanned by any of the
Acunitex IPs listed in the IOC section should expect and protect from further intrusion
attempts performed by ENT-1 and/or related APT groups which possibly have been
provided with the same target list.

4.

CobaltStrike infrastructure
The CobaltStrike infrastructure shows different variations of customization where
publicly available (malleable) or default profiles are sometimes used but also more
advanced methods are observed. Typosquat domains and certificates are commonly
utilized to make the traffic blend in. For example, a self-signed certificate imitating
Microsoft on 141.164.62.81 over port 443:

Figure 4 Self signed certificate on C2

The CobaltStrike Command and Control (C2s) are often observed on compromised
Glassfish servers. This could be due to CobaltStrike being utilized as the first layer
backdoor during campaigns where the more well -known ENT-1 utilized backdoors
such as Shadowpad, Spyder and the Winnti backdoor are deployed as a second stage
payload on interesting victims. This behaviour indicates that the Glassfish servers are
seen as use-and-throw away C2s.
More ambitious efforts of CobaltStrike usage is a custom stager called Fishmaster
according to the embedded PDB path:

Figure 5 PDB path for Browser_Plugin.exe

Avast classifies the sample as “Win64:BidenHappy-A [Apt]”, likely due to the
embedded string:

Figure 6 Embedded string in Fishmaster sample

The sample were hosted at hxxps://jquery-code[.]ml/Download/Browser_Plugin.exe
and at the index page of the domain the html loads an iframe of code.jquery.com in
order to appear legitimate:

Figure 7 Observed iframe usage

The stager will request a pdf from a Cobalt Strike C2 on the URL path
hxxp://37.61.205[.]212:8880/dow/Aili.pdf and store it to “C:\Users\Public\Aili.pdf”. The
pdf holds a job-application in Mandarin for a Vietnamese individual:

Secondly the stager will request the CobaltStrike related destination
hxxp://micsoftin[.]us:2086/dow/83.dmp, part of the response is XOR encoded with the
key “misgat_mg” which the stager will decode and executed as shellcode. We have
been unable to download the 83.dmp payload but explain the payload structure below:

Figure 9 Format of likely CobaltStrike beacon payload

The use-case behind the downloaded pdf is unknown and we encourage fellow
researchers to explore it in depth for the possibility of it holding command and control
traffic. The adoption of Fishmaster still appears relatively low and it remains to be
seen if it will become an integral of the groups toolset.

Shadowpad, Spyder and Winnti backdoor
utilization

5.

ENT-1 extensively use Shadowpad, Spyder and the Winnti backdoor for long-running
operations. It is not unseen that the group keep on using domains and IPs even after
they have publicly been reported, for example the following domains are still actively
used even though they are publicly reported:
-

livehost[.]live (Reported by ESET 31th Jan 2020 [1], still utilized Apr 2021)

-

symantecupd[.]com (Reported by PTSecurity Jan 2021 [3], still used Apr 2021)

ENT-1 has also utilized snoc.hostingupdate[.]club which is reported by Dr Web as a
Spyder C2, Spyder is a backdoor reported to be utilized by Winnti Group [5].
Given the large infrastructure overlaps and shared toolset utilization NTT Threat
Detection assess ENT-1 to be part of Winnti Group.

6.

Breadcrumbs from other payloads
The likely GlassFish exploited server 168.138.137.235 appears to have been utilized
as hosting-grounds for ENT-1 payloads. On Virustotal some samples are uploaded,
among them a malicious lnk shortcut named “Business Registration_JHUAN SHUN
MOTOR CO., LTD.pdf.lnk” targeted towards a Taiwanese entity.

Another clue towards Taiwanese targeting is a previously hosted self-extracting
archive with “TW” in the filename:

7.

Conclusion
ENT-1 shows signs of being a full-time funded APT group with a continuously
diversified toolset and a growing network infrastructure to support their operations.

How NTT Can help
NTT Security Threat Intelligence researchers are monitoring telemetry of suspicious
traffic traversing our Global IP Network Service global tier -1 IPv4/IPv6 backbone
network for threat indications. Correlating such findings with the insights of our global
Advanced Threat Detection (ATD) and Managed Detection and Response (MDR)
services enable a truly unique and global perspective of the continuously evolving
cyber security threat landscape.
Research findings on threat actors and campaigns, such as ENT-1, are continuously
being feed from our Threat Intelligence analyst back into our services as MachineLearning capabilities, Behaviour models, Indicators -of-Compromise(IOC)’s and Threat
Intelligence. Enhancing the services ability to efficiently Monitor, Detect, Triage and
Respond to these threats on behalf of our clients. Often w ithout depending on an
initial compromise.
