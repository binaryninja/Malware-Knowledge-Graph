Summary
SHA256: dedb8516befa4a5088000b8c7f699dae7f33761403dd355a14684ac89ff56a9a
Filename: Unknown
Filetype: DLL
File size: 39KB
From here on, the above DLL will be referred to as “downloader.dll”. The file is capable of:
Downloading files
Interacting with a C2 server

Malware Overview
This is an older file that was first identified around October 2021.
Downloader.dll is a downloader capable of downloading a file from a hardcoded command and control (C2) server. A follow-on stage was not
identified.
The file disguises itself as an extension for Foxit Reader software. Foxit is a software that develops document formatting tools and is based in
the U.S. and China.

Figure 1

Upon running the DLL, a request is made to online-manual.c1[.]biz, and a file is downloaded to %TEMP%. Looking at the strings output of the
file, there is a large base64 encoded string that when decoded, appears to be a batch file as seen below.
@echo off
cd /d %TEMP%
:WAITING
timeout /t 1
if not exist "a.log" (goto WAITING)
del /f /q "a.log"
install.bat
del /f /q "%~dpnx0"

Again analyzing just the strings, we see a call to run the batch file via the following command:
cmd /c cd /d "%TEMP%" && temp.bat

One can only assume that the downloaded file is run with another command run via the DLL file:
cmd /c expand "%s" -F:* "%s" && del /f /q "%s" && echo OK > a.log

The encoded strings represented by “%s” are likely the downloaded file. We can see from the above output that the file is deleted upon the
above command completing.

The above infrastructure was tied to a possible Konni campaign by Black Lotus Labs in late November 2021.
Looks similar to this prior campaign from about a month ago

Basic Snort/Suricata Rule
alert tcp $HOME_NET any -> any any (msg: “Probaly shouldnt run in production. Possible Konni DLL download URL,”; content:

Unfortunately, the C2 is likely no longer active, and this sample crashes when run in a sandbox. Still, this is an interesting sample that is likely
tied to Konni, and learning occurred, so that is always a win!
Thank you for reading.
