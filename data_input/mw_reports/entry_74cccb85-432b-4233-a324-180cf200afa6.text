OmniRAT Takes Over Android Devices Through Social Engineering Tricks

1/7

Remote administration tools can be hugely helpful to the increasingly mobile workforce, but
malware analysts say a product called OmniRAT has turned into a highly effective means of
stealing data.
The research team at Avast provided details of security incidents involving OmniRAT, which
is made in Germany and not necessarily intended for cybercriminal activity. In at least one
case, however, victims were fooled into thinking the Android Stagefright vulnerability was
preventing them from receiving an MMS and they needed to click on a bit.ly link to get it.
They would then enter a code based on a malicious SMS that gives cybercriminals control
over an Android device. This meant cybercriminals were also able to more easily distribute
malware by accessing users’ contact lists.
Unfortunately, remote administration tools have a history of being hijacked for nefarious
purposes. Before OmniRAT, there was DroidJack, SecurityWeek pointed out, which was also
co-opted by India-based cybercriminals to take over Android devices. The malicious use of
DroidJack is still under investigation by European law enforcement authorities.
What may make OmniRat even more attractive to cybercriminals is its price tag. For a mere
$25, they have access to a tool that can be paired with fairly straightforward social
engineering techniques to target mobile users. This compares with $210 for DroidJack on the
black market, TechWorm reported. Besides stealing data, the tool could also be used to
probe browser histories and record conversations, so the potential for damage, particularly
among smartphone users conducting business remotely, is huge.

The misuse of software like OmniRAT has gotten so bad that they’ve begun to be called
remote-access Trojans, according to Softpedia. On the other hand, it’s difficult if not
impossible to outlaw remote administration tools entirely because they can also be put to
good use. For example, they can be used for testing or as a tool for staff developers.
You’re safe from something like OmniRAT if you ignore an SMS that comes from attackers. If
you’re a CISO or part of an IT security team, it would also help to educate or remind staff to
make sure they aren’t too quick to bypass permissions popups that could prevent
cybercriminals from taking the next step and controlling their devices.
