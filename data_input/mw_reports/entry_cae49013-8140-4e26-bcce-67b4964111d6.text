Researchers discovered a flaw in the encryption algorithm used by
Hive ransomware that allowed them to decrypt data.
Researchers discovered a flaw in the encryption algorithm used by Hive ransomware that
allowed them to decrypt data without knowing the private key used by the gang to encrypt
files.
The Hive ransomware operation has been active since June 2021, it provides Ransomwareas-a-Service Hive and adopts a double-extortion model threatening to publish data stolen
from the victims on their leak site (HiveLeaks). In April 2021, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) has released a flash alert on the Hive ransomware attacks that includes
technical details and indicators of compromise associated with the operations of the gang.
According to a report published by blockchain analytics company Chainalysis, the Hive
ransomware is one of the top 10 ransomware strains by revenue in 2021. The group used a
variety of attack methods, including malspam campaigns, vulnerable RDP servers, and
compromised VPN credentials.
“Hive ransomware uses a hybrid encryption scheme, but uses its own symmetric cipher to
encrypt files. We were able to recover the master key for generating the file encryption key
without the attacker’s private key, by using a cryptographic vulnerability identified through
analysis. As a result of our experiments, encrypted files were successfully decrypted using
the recovered master key based on our mechanism.” reads the paper published by
researchers from Kookmin University (South Korea). “To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first successful attempt at decrypting the Hive ransomware. We experimentally
demonstrated that more than 95% of the keys used for encryption could be recovered using
the method we suggested.”
The technique devised by the team of academics was able to recover more than 95% of the
keys used
for the encryption process that is represented in the following image:

The experts detailed the process used by Hive ransomware to generate and store master
key for victim files. The ransomware generates 10MiB of random data, and uses it as a
master key. The malware extracted from a specific offset of the master key 1MiB and 1KiB of
data for each file to be encrypted and uses as a keystream. The offset is stored in the
encrypted file name of each file. This means that experts were able to determine the offset of
the keystream stored in the filename and decrypt the file.
“Hive ransomware encrypts files by XORing the data with a random keystream that is
different for each file. We found that this random keystream was sufficiently guessable.”
continues the paper. “Hive ransomware generates a data encryption keystream (EKS) that
appears random for each file, and encrypts the file by XORing EKS with the file. However,
EKS is created using two keystreams extracted from the previously created master key
During the encryption process, only the part of the file, not the entire area, is encrypted.”
The results of the tests demonstrated the efficiency of the method, the master key recovered
92% succeeded in decrypting approximately 72% of the files, while the master key restored
96% succeeded in decrypting approximately 82% of the files, and the master key restored
98% succeeded in decrypting approximately 98% of the files.
