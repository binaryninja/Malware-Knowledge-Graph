Abstract
Neutrino Bot (also known and detected as Win/Kasidet) is a rapidly changing threat. It first
became known around December 2013. It has been actively developed ever since resulting
in version 5.4 at the very beginning of 2018. It is being sold for an attractive price to a large
variety of cybercriminals.
This paper shows an extensive summary of the history of the bot while focusing on the most
recent versions. It presents methods how to analyse Neutrino botnets and provides key
findings that have been discovered during the year 2018.
