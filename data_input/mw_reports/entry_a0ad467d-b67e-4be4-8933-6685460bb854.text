It was not a long ago when we encountered a massive data breach at T-mobile, which
affected millions of users’ SSN, mobile numbers, driving licenses, etc. This time it seems to
be different, and perhaps, more concerning.
The notorious cybercriminal group, ShinyHunters, claims to have gained access to the AT&T
database, affecting over 70 Million users’ SSNs and Dates of Birth.

It should be noted that the group is being investigated by multiple law enforcement agencies
worldwide, including the FBI.

Failed Extortion Attempt?
The research community has seen a change in its tactics in the last few months. The
ShinyHuntes group extorts their victims and often shares their RaidForum profile and media
press on the credibility of their claims. If a victim refuses to pay the extortion, the group puts
them for sale on cybercrime forums.

Conclusion
The ShinyHunters group is a known and credible threat actor. The claims made by the group
can not be discounted, given their history. On this issue, whether they were able to breach
AT&T’s infrastructure, found a misconfigured databases on the internet, or compromised the
third party with AT&T information, time will tell us.
Update: “Based on our investigation today, the information that appeared in an
internet chat room does not appear to have come from our systems.” AT&T
commented on the issue.
If the claims are genuine, this might be one of the most sensitive data breaches of
2021.
At the time of writing this blog, there are no known reports or disclosure by AT&T on this
alleged data breach.
