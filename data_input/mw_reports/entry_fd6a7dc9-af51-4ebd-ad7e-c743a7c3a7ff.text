2. Threat Thursday: Arkei Infostealer Expands Reach Using SmokeLoader to Target Crypto Wallets and MFA

Summary
The criminal group behind the Arkei information stealer appears to be interested in more than just picking our pockets.
While cryptocurrency remains a primary target for the malware, which has recently been tied to use of the stealthy
SmokeLoader downloader, a new analysis of Arkei shows that it has now expanded its reach to collect multifactor (MFA)
authentication data as well.
It’s not currently clear what attackers are looking to do with this information, but a threat group that is specifically targeting
this information has the capacity to impact people using MFA both at home and at work.
Arkei also downloads a variety of legitimate components, which are often hosted via compromised websites, and puts
them to use for malicious purposes. Much of Arkei’s flexibility relies on its configuration file, often hosted alongside these
legitimate components, to receive its marching orders. Depending on what is enabled in this file, the malware will perform
different activities, such as stealing saved password details, raiding auto-complete forms, and purloining saved credit card
details and browser cookies.

Risk & Impact

Technical Analysis
Attack Vector
Like many modern information-stealer families such as RedLine, Arkei is often sold and distributed as Malware-as-aService (MaaS), which means its initial attack vector can vary. However, over the past few weeks, this threat has been
spotted utilizing the notorious downloader SmokeLoader as a method of deployment. Both Arkei and SmokeLoader have
been identified using the same Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and known-malicious URLs to conduct their malicious
functionality.
Information-stealers and banking Trojans commonly use malware downloaders like SmokeLoader to get onto a victim
device. Often, these types of malware rely on phishing websites or Trojanized download pages for hosting, offering
seemingly benign software – cracked paid-applications or other potentially-trojanized downloads – to entice people to
accept their poisoned offerings.
Components
On execution, Arkei will attempt to make several HTTP web-requests to a malicious URL. These GET HTTP Requests
are designed to download known-legitimate components that the malware will then use to achieve some of its malicious
functionality.
Once downloaded, Arkei will typically store the following Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) into the %\ProgramData\%
directory for use throughout its execution process.
Name

sqlite3.dll

SQLite Database Management DLL

freebl3.dll

Freebl Network Security Service Library for Mozilla

mozglue.dll

msvcp140.dll

Constituent file for Visual C++ for Visual Studio 2015

2/11

vcruntime140.dll

Runtime library for Visual Studio (Visual C++)

Configuration
Once Arkei has obtained its components, it will make one final GET Request to the same malicious URL to obtain its
configuration file, as shown in Figure 1. This file is a small Base64-encoded .PHP file.
Arkei interprets the data within this configuration file and, depending on which flags are enabled within it, will carry out
different malicious activities. This strategy makes the malware extremely flexible, as it allows the threat actor to extend
the threat’s capabilities, or to focus on specific information to steal. For example, depending on which items in the
configuration file are enabled, it determines which applications to automatically exfiltrate data from.

Figure 1: Request for Arkei's configuration
Using the CyberChef tool, the data contained within the config file can be de-obfuscated, as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2: CyberChef output of Arkei config
Anti-Emulation and Region Checks
Arkei will check both the region of the device and the computer name. If the malware is executed with the computer name
“HAL9TH,” it will terminate its execution chain. This computer name check is done because it is the name given to the
Windows Defender Emulator; this technique is used by malware to prevent itself from running in an emulated
environment.

3/11

The malware will also exit if it finds it’s being run in one of the following regions:
Russian (Russia)
Uzbek (Latin, Uzbekistan)
Azerbaijani (Cyrillic, Azerbaijan)
Kazakh (Kazakhstan)
Belarusian (Belarus)
Browser Targets
One of the first pieces of information Arkei will attempt to steal is information about the victim’s Internet browser. Arkei
searches for the presence of many popular browsers, including Google Chrome™ and Firefox, before attempting to
scrape various pieces of data from them to exfiltrate.
The following applications are typically targeted:
Targeted Browsers
Google Chrome

Chromium

Microsoft Edge

Kometa

Amigo

Torch

Orbitum

Comodo Dragon

Nichrome

Maxthon5

Sputnik

Epic Privacy Browsers NEW

Vivaldi

CocCoc

Uran

QIP Surf

Elements

TorBro

CryptoTab

Brave

Opera

OperaGX

OperaNeon

FireFox

SlimBrowser

PaleMoon

Waterfox

Cyberfox

BlackHawk

IceCat

KMeleon

Thunderbird

Grabber
Arkei has an internal function labelled “Grabber,” which finds valuable information stored in Internet browsers. Because
information is stored differently in each browser, Arkei has specific locations of a victim device where it looks for data to
steal.
If enabled via the configuration file, Arkei will initially attempt to store different types of information in text files with the
following file names.
Name

Description

4/11

Cookies.txt

Browser cookies

Autofill.txt

Auto-filled stored information

History.txt

Internet browser history

CC.txt

Stored credit card details

Downloads.txt

Internet download paths

Passwords.txt

Stored passwords

Browser Extensions
One of most notable functions of Arkei is its ability to steal data from Google Chrome browser extensions. For each
Chrome-based extension, an “Extension ID” is given. The malware uses this information to harvest data stored within.
This Extension ID is often stored within the following folders:
%AppData%\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Local Extension Settings
%AppData%\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Sync Extension Settings
%AppData%\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\IndexedDB\Domain Name.indexeddb.leveldb
Arkei will attempt to harvest any files located within the extension folder. For cryptocurrency holders, this malware poses
a significant threat due to the large number of wallets and crypto services it targets.
However, Arkei is not solely focused on stealing cryptocurrency. Arkei appears to also target additional Chrome-based
browser extensions related to two-factor and multifactor authentication (2FA/MFA) and password management,
increasing its risk to both corporate and private environments. It’s not entirely clear what attackers seek to do with this
information; they could be seeking to change the device used to verify 2FA access (such as someone’s cell phone) to one
controlled by attackers.

Crypto Wallets
Arkei does not just stop at targeting crypto currencies via browser extensions. Many people prefer not to use third-party
applications and services to store their digital currency. So, like the BlackJack component of BHunt we discussed in last
week’s Threat Thursday blog, Arkei performs a similar routine to look for specific crypto wallets stored locally on the
victim’s device.
Arkei will sweep through various folders looking for specific files related to cryptocurrency. This threat will search specific
folders for terms like “wallet.dat,” which is a file-name format used by a wide range of different currencies. If a match is
found, the malware attempts to store the content of the file in a SQL database, which it will exfiltrate back to its commandand-control (C2) server.
Though Arkei has the ability to target a wide range of crypto wallets, observed samples have had dedicated functionality
to target the following crypto wallets:
Crypto Wallets
Exodus

Atomic

Bitcoin

Binance

JAXX

ElectrumLTC

Ethereum

MultiDoge

Coinomi

Electron Cash

Exfiltration
Once Arkei has finished ransacking the victim’s computer, it will attempt to bundle all the data it has obtained and
exfiltrate it back to its C2. It collects this information in a folder with a name that is typically comprised of 12 random
letters and numbers [0-9A-Z], as shown in Figure 3.
As Arkei obtains data, it will catalog that information before sending it back to the C2. As part of this catalog, the malware
will also take a screenshot of the victim device and gather system information into a file called “system.txt.”

Figure 3: Example of Arkei exfiltration file
System Information
The system.txt file contains the following information about the victim’s device:
System Info

7/11

IP Address

Display Resolution

Country

PC Name

Working Path

Username

Display Language

Domain Name

Keyboard Language

MachineID

Is Laptop

GUID

Processor

OS

Installed RAM

Video card

Arkei will also append a list of all installed software to this text file before exfiltrating the data. The data from Arkei is then
sent to a new C2 and exfiltrated to the URL it initially reached out to.
Once Arkei has completed this step and exfiltration is successful, it will kill the process and delete itself. This is done as a
clean-up mechanism to remove the malware from the device and prevent the victim from discovering they have been
targeted.

Conclusions
Arkei is a flexible and stealthy information stealer that can impact both personal and corporate devices. As a MaaS, it
bundles together several desirable features for attackers to use, allowing them to change infection tactics to suit their
needs.
Inclusion of a configuration file allows threat actors to tailor exactly what information they choose to steal from the victim.
And using legitimate files to perform nefarious functions makes Arkei more difficult for legacy anti-malware products to
detect.
As more people both use cryptocurrencies and work from home, it is becoming more common to store personal financial
information, as well as corporate data, on personal devices. This makes information-stealing an extremely rewarding
pursuit for threat actors, who will continue pushing boundaries in their attempts to pursue bigger financial rewards.
Who is Typically Affected?
Commercial and Professional Services
Consumer Durables and Apparel
Telecommunication Services
Public Sector
Insurance
Mitigation Tips
Avoid downloading cracked software, or software from unknown/unverified links.
Make sure corporate login credentials and personal passwords are not saved in your browser.
Use two-factor authentication on a separate device, such as an authentication application installed on a mobile
phone or tablet.
