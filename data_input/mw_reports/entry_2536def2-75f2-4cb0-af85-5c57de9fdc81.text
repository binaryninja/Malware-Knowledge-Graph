Kaspersky Lab has identified a massive uptick in cyber espionage in Russia by 'Chinesespeaking' APTs.

TENERIFE, SPAIN – Kaspersky Security Analyst Summit 2016 – Cyber espionage attacks
by Chinese advanced persistent threat groups against Russian targets have increased by
300 percent in the past two months, according to a top security expert with Kaspersky Lab.
Costin Raiu, director of the global research and analysis team at Kaspersky Lab, says his
firm’s researchers witnessed a dramatic drop in Chinese-speaking APTs going after US and
UK organizations’ intellectual property in September after President Obama and Chinese
president Xi Jinping came to a historic agreement not to conduct cyber spying attacks for

economic gain. Kaspersky Lab refrains from confirming the actual actors behind advanced
groups such as nation-states, so it refers to these attackers as "Chinese-speaking" cyber
espionage groups.
“Immediately after the signing of the agreement, there was silence” in attacks against the
US, Raiu said in an interview with Dark Reading. “Then there were some small bits and
pieces of random noise … but after that, they [Chinese-speaking APTs] completely went
silent in the US and UK,” Raiu said, referring to Xi’s similar no-hack deal in October with
Prime Minister Cameron in the UK.
Raiu said the cyber espionage groups appear to have shifted their focus to Russia and other
former Soviet countries as new sources of intellectual property for economic gain in the wake
of the Obama-Xi pact.
While the Obama-Xi agreement was applauded by the security and IT industries as a good
first step, critics had expected China ultimately not to fully comply with the agreement. Those
concerns appeared to come to fruition in October, when CrowdStrike reported spotting
multiple Chinese APT groups attempting to steal business secrets from seven US companies
in the technology and pharmaceutical industries the day after the Obama-Xi agreement. The
Obama-Xi pact stops short of banning traditional espionage via hacking.
Kaspersky’s Raiu said his company has seen activity from Mirage, a Chinese-speaking APT
group that traditionally has targeted ministries of foreign affairs, waging attacks in Russia.
“Now they are super-active in Russia,” he said, with interests in military espionage, for
example. But there have been “several” APT groups seen targeting Russian victims, he said.
Kurt Baumgartner, principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab, says the increased activity
targets “a geopolitical profile.”
Industries that support those geopolitical interests and structure are also under attack, he
said.
CrowdStrike also has seen more Chinese attacks on Russia -- from a specific Chinese APT
group called Hammer Panda against Russian Federation nations. But it's also still seeing
China-based attacks on US companies.
"We have definitely observed an increase in Hammer Panda targeting of the Russian
Federation. In the [CrowdStrike] Global Threat Report ... we observe that following an
agreement between China and Russia in May 2015 to abolish any type of hacking between
the two states, we observed an almost immediate violation of the agreement by China," said
Adam Meyers, vice president of intelligence at CrowdStrike. "We have continued to observe
China-based intrusion groups targeting US companies."
