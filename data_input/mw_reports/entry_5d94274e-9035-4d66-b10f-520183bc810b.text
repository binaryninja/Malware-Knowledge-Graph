EVOLUTION OF CYBER THREATS IN THE CORPORATE SECTOR

In late 2014, we published predictions for how the world of cyber threats
may evolve in 2015. Four of the nine predictions we made were directly
connected with threats to businesses. Our predictions proved accurate –
three of the four business-related threats have already been fulfilled:
•
•
•
•

Cybercriminals embrace APT tactics for targeted attacks – yes.
APT groups fragment, diversify attacks – yes.
Escalation of ATM and PoS attacks – yes.
Attacks against virtual payment systems – no.

Let’s have a look back at the major incidents of 2015 and at the new
trends we have observed in information security within the business
environment.

THE YEAR IN FIGURES
•
•
•
•

In 2015 one or more malware attacks were blocked on 58% of
corporate computers. This is a 3 p.p. rise on the previous year.
29% of computers – i.e. almost every third business-owned
computer – were subjected to one or more web-based attacks.
Malware exploiting vulnerabilities in office applications were used
3 times more often than in attacks against home users.
File antivirus detection was triggered on 41% of corporate computers
(objects were detected on computers or on removable media
connected to computers: flash drives, memory cards, telephones,
external hard drives, or network disks).

TARGETED ATTACKS ON BUSINESSES:
APT AND CYBERCRIMINALS
2015 saw a number of APT attacks launched against businesses. The toolkits
and methods used were very similar to those we observed when analyzing
earlier APT attacks, but it was cybercriminals rather than state-sponsored
groups who were behind the attacks. The methods used may not be
characteristic of cybercriminals, but the main aim of their attacks remained
the same: financial gain.
The Carbanak campaign became a vivid example of how APT-class targeted
attacks have shifted focus to financial organizations. The campaign was
one of bona fide bank robberies in the digital age: the cybercriminals
penetrated a bank’s network looking for a critical system, which they then
used to siphon off money. After stealing a hefty sum (anywhere between
$2.5 million and $10 million) from a bank, they moved on to the next victim.
Most of the organizations targeted were located in Eastern Europe.
However, the Carbanak campaign has also targeted victims in the US,
Germany and China. Up to 100 financial institutions have been affected
across the globe, and the total losses could be as a high as $1 billion.

EVOLUTION OF CYBER THREATS IN THE CORPORATE SECTOR

It shouldn’t be forgotten that information can also be of great value, especially
if it can be used when making deals or trading on the stock exchange, be
it in commodities, securities or currency markets, including cryptocurrency
markets. One example of a targeted attack that may have been hunting
for such information is Wild Neutron (aka Jripbot and Morpho). This cyberespionage campaign first hit the headlines in 2013 when it affected several
reputable companies, including Apple, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft.
After these incidents received widespread publicity the actors behind the
cyberespionage campaign suspended their activities. However, about a year
later Kaspersky Lab observed that Wild Neutron had resumed operations.
Our research has shown that the cyberespionage campaign caused
infections on user computers in 11 countries and territories, namely Russia,
France, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Slovenia, Palestine, the United
Arab Emirates, Kazakhstan, Algeria and the US. The victims included law
firms, investment companies, bitcoin-related companies, enterprises
and business groups involved in M&A deals, IT companies, healthcare
companies, real estate companies, as well as individual users.
It should be noted that Wild Neutron used a code signing certificate stolen
from Acer.

The trend towards the diversification of APT attacks is well illustrated by
the change in targets attacked by the Chinese cybercriminal group Winnti.
It was a long-held belief that Winnti only attacked computer gaming
companies. However, in autumn 2015 evidence began to emerge that
showed the group had performed a test run of their tools and methods
and were trying to make money by attacking new targets. Their attention
is no longer limited to the entertainment industry, with recent targets

KASPERSKY SECURITY BULLETIN 2015

including pharmaceutical and telecom companies. Analysis of the new
wave of Winnti attacks has revealed that (as with Wild Neutron) the Winnti
rootkit was signed with a stolen certificate that belonged to a division at
a major Japanese conglomerate.
Another development in 2015 was the expanding geographies of both
the attacks and the attackers. For example, when Kaspersky Lab experts
were investigating a Middle East incident, they came across activity by
a previously unknown group conducting targeted attacks. The group,
dubbed the Desert Falcons, is the first Arab actor to conduct full-blown
cyberespionage attacks. At the time the group was detected, its victims
numbered around 300, including financial organizations.
Another group named Blue Termite attacked organizations and companies
in Japan:

Information about targeted attacks on businesses is available in the following
Kaspersky Lab reports: Carbanak, Wild Neutron, Winnti, DarkHotel 2015,
Desert Falcons, Blue Termit, Grabit. More detailed research results are
provided to subscribers of the Kaspersky Intelligence Service.
Analysis of these attacks has identified several trends in the evolution of
targeted attacks on businesses:
•

Financial organizations such as banks, funds and exchange-related
companies, including cryptocurrency exchanges, have been
subjected to attacks by cybercriminals.

The attacks are meticulously planned. The cybercriminals scrutinize
the interests of potential victims (employees at the targeted company),
and identify the websites they are most likely to visit; they examine
the targeted company’s contacts, equipment and service providers.
The information collected at the preparation stage is then put to use.
The attackers hack legitimate websites that have been identified and
the business contact accounts of the targeted company’s employees.
The sites and accounts are used for several hours to distribute
malicious code, after which the infection is deactivated. This means
the cybercriminals can re-use the compromised resources again later.
Signed files and legitimate software is used to collect information
from the attacked network.
Attacks are diversifying to include small and medium-sized businesses.
The geography of attacks on businesses is expanding: a massive attack
occurred in Japan, the emergence of new APT groups in Arab countries.

Although there are relatively few APT attacks launched by cybercriminals,
the way they are developing will undoubtedly influence the methods and
approaches employed by other cybercriminals in their operations against
businesses.

STATISTICS
The statistics for corporate users (including the geography of attacks and
ratings for detected objects) tend to coincide with those for home users.
This is unsurprising because business users do not exist in an isolated
environment and their computers are targeted by cybercriminals who
spread malware irrespective of the nature of the target. These types of
attacks and malware constitute the majority, while attacks specifically
targeting business users have little impact on the overall statistics.
In 2015, one or more malware attack was blocked on 58% of corporate
user computers, which is a 3 p.p. rise on last year.

Online threats (Web-based attacks)
In 2015, almost every third (29%) computer in a business environment
was subjected to one or more web-based attacks.

KASPERSKY SECURITY BULLETIN 2015

First place is occupied by various malicious programs that were detected
with the help of cloud technologies, and assigned the umbrella verdict of
‘DangerousObject.Multi.Generic’. Cloud technologies work when antivirus
databases do not yet contain signatures or heuristics to detect a malicious
program but the company’s cloud antivirus database already includes
information about the object. When a client company cannot send statistics
to the cloud, Kaspersky Private Security Network is used instead, meaning
that network computers receive protection from the cloud.
Most of the remaining positions in the ranking are occupied by selfpropagating malware programs and their components.

CHARACTERISTICS OF ATTACKS ON BUSINESSES
The overall statistics for corporate users do not reflect the specific
attributes of attacks launched against businesses; the stats are influenced
more by the probability of a computer infection in a country, or by how
popular a specific malware program is with cybercriminals.
However, a more detailed analysis reveals the peculiarities of attacks on
corporate users:
•
•
•

exploits for vulnerabilities found in office applications are used three
times more often than in attacks on home users;
use of malicious files signed with valid digital certificates;
use of legitimate programs in attacks, allowing the attackers to go
undetected for longer.

We have also observed a rapid growth in the number of corporate user
computers attacked by encryptor programs.
In this particular context, the majority of cases are not APT attacks:
“standard” cybercriminals are simply focusing on corporate users, and
sometimes on a particular company that is of interest to them.

Use of exploits in attacks on businesses
The ranking of vulnerable applications is compiled based on information
about exploits blocked by Kaspersky Lab products and used by
cybercriminals, both in web- and email-based attacks, as well as attempts
to compromise local applications, including those on mobile devices.

12

EVOLUTION OF CYBER THREATS IN THE CORPORATE SECTOR

If we compare the use of exploits by cybercriminals to attack home and
corporate users, the first obvious difference is that exploits for office
software vulnerabilities are used much more often in attacks launched
against businesses. They are only used in 4% of attacks on home users,
but when it comes to attacks on corporate users, they make up 12% of all
exploits detected throughout the year.
Web browsers are the applications targeted most often by exploits in
attacks on both home and corporate users. When viewing these statistics,
it should be noted that Kaspersky Lab technologies detect exploits at
various stages. Detection of landing pages from which exploits are
distributed are also counted in the ‘Browsers’ category. We have observed
that most often these are exploits for vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player.

Distribution of exploits used in cybercriminal attacks by type of attacked application in
2014 and 2015

The proportions of Java and PDF exploits have declined significantly
compared to 2014, by 14 p.p. and 8 p.p., respectively. Java exploits have
lost some of their popularity in spite of the fact that several zero-day
vulnerabilities that been found during the year. The proportion of attacks
launched using vulnerabilities in office software (+8 p.p.), browsers (+9 p.p.),
Adobe Flash Player (+9 p.p), and Android software (+3 p.p.) have risen.
Investigations of security incidents have shown that even in targeted attacks
on corporations, cybercriminals often use exploits for known vulnerabilities.
This is because corporate environments are slow to install appropriate

13

KASPERSKY SECURITY BULLETIN 2015

security patches. The proportion of exploits that target vulnerabilities in
Android applications has risen to 7%, which suggests cybercriminals have
a growing interest in corporate data stored on employees’ mobile devices.

Ransomware
Encryption Trojans were long considered to be a threat to home users only.
Nowadays, however, we see ransomware actors paying more attention to
organizations as targets.
In 2015, Kaspersky Lab solutions detected ransomware on more than
50,000 computers in corporate networks, which is double the figure for
2014. It is important to keep in mind that the real number of incidents
is several times higher: the statistics reflect only the results of signaturebased and heuristic detections, while in most cases Kaspersky Lab products
detect encryption Trojans based on behavior recognition models.

The number of unique corporate users attacked by encryption Trojans in 2014 and
2015

There are two reasons for the surge in interest in businesses by ransomware
actors. Firstly, they can receive much bigger ransoms from organizations
than from individual users. Secondly, there is a better chance the ransom
will be paid: some companies simply cannot continue their operations if
information has been encrypted and is unavailable on critical computers
and/or servers.

14

EVOLUTION OF CYBER THREATS IN THE CORPORATE SECTOR

One of the most interesting developments of 2015 in this realm has been the
emergence of the first Linux encryption malware (Kaspersky Lab products
detect it as the verdict ‘Trojan-Ransom.Linux.Cryptor’), which targets websites,
including online stores. The cybercriminals exploited vulnerabilities in web
applications to gain access to websites, and then uploaded a malicious
program to the sites that encrypted the server data. In the majority of cases,
this brought the site down. The cybercriminals demanded a ransom of one
bitcoin to restore the site. Around 2,000 websites are estimated to have been
infected. Given the popularity of *nix servers in the business environment,
it is reasonable to assume that next year there may be more ransomware
attacks against non-Windows platforms.

Virtually all the ransomware families in the Top 10 demand ransoms in
bitcoins.
The Scatter family of Trojans occupies first place. They encrypt files on
the hard drive and leave encrypted files with the extension .vault. Scatter
Trojans are multi-module, multi-purpose script-based malicious programs.
This malware family has quickly evolved over a short period, developing
new Email-Worm and Trojan-PSW capabilities on top of file encryption.
In second place is the Onion family of encryptors, known for the fact
that their C&C servers are located within the Tor network. In third place is
the Cryakl family of encryptors, which are written in Delphi and emerged
back in April 2014.
In some cases, it may be possible to restore the data encrypted by these
ransomware programs, usually when there are mistakes of some kind in
their algorithms. However, it is currently impossible to decrypt data that
has been encrypted by the latest versions of the malicious programs in
the Top 10.

15

KASPERSKY SECURITY BULLETIN 2015

It is important for companies to understand that an infection by malware
of this kind can interfere with business operations if critical business data
is lost or a critical server operation is blocked due to encryption. Attacks
like this can lead to huge losses, comparable to those caused by the
Wiper malware attacks that destroyed data in corporate networks.
To address this threat, a number of measures should be taken:
•
•

•

16

deploy protection against exploits;
ensure behavioral detection methods are enabled in your security
product (in Kaspersky Lab products, this is done in the System Watcher
component);
configure a data backup procedure.

EVOLUTION OF CYBER THREATS IN THE CORPORATE SECTOR

ATTACKS ON POS TERMINALS
The security of point-of-sale (PoS) terminals has turned into another
pressing issue for businesses, especially those involved in trading activities.
Any computer with a special card reader device connected to it and the
right software installed can be used as a PoS terminal. Cybercriminals
hunt for these computers and infect them with malicious programs that
allow them to steal the details of bank cards used to pay at the terminals.
Kaspersky Lab’s security products have blocked over 11,500 such attacks
across the world. To date, there are 10 malware families in our collection
that are designed to steal data from PoS terminals. Seven of these emerged
this year. Despite the small number of attacks that are attempted, this risk
should not be underestimated, because just one successful attack could
compromise the details of tens of thousands of credit cards. Such a large
number of potential victims is possible because business owners and
system administrators do not see PoS terminals as devices that require
protection. As a result, an infected terminal could go unnoticed for a long
time, during which the malicious program sends the details of all the
credit cards passing through the terminal to cybercriminals.
This problem is especially relevant in those countries where cards with
EMV chips are not used. The adoption of EMV chip cards should make
it far more difficult to obtain the data required to clone banking cards,
although the adoption process could take a long time. In the meantime,
there are some minimum measures that should be taken to protect PoS
devices. Fortunately, for these devices it is fairly easy to configure the
‘default deny’ security policy, which blocks unknown programs from
launching by default.
We expect that in the future cybercriminals will start targeting mobile PoS
devices running under Android.

17

KASPERSKY SECURITY BULLETIN 2015

CONCLUSION
The data collected from Kaspersky Lab products shows that the tools
used to attack businesses differ from those used against home users. In
attacks on corporate users, exploits for office application vulnerabilities
are used much more often, malicious files are often signed with valid
digital certificates, and cybercriminals try to use legitimate software
for their purposes, so they can go unnoticed for longer. We have also
observed strong growth in the numbers of corporate user computers
targeted by ransomware. This also applies to incidents not classified as
APT attacks, where cybercriminals merely focus on corporate users, and
sometimes on employees of specific companies.
The fact that cybercriminal groups use APT methods and programs to
attack businesses takes them to a different level and makes them much
more dangerous. Cybercriminals have begun to use these methods
primarily to steal large sums of money from banks. They can use the
same methods to steal a company’s money from bank accounts by
gaining access to its corporate network.
Cybercriminals rely on exploiting known vulnerabilities to conduct their
attacks – this is due to the fact that many organizations are slow to
implement software updates on their corporate computers. In addition,
cybercriminals make use of signed malicious files and legitimate tools to
create channels for extracting information: these tools include popular
remote administration software, SSH clients, password restoration
software, etc.
More and more frequently, corporate servers are being targeted by
cybercriminals. Besides stealing data, there have been cases when
the attacked servers were used to launch DDoS attacks, or the data on
the servers was encrypted for ransom. Recent developments have shown
that this is true for both Windows and Linux servers.
Many of the organizations that suffered attacks have received ransom
demands asking for payments in return for halting an ongoing DDoS
attack, unblocking encrypted data, or for not disclosing stolen information.
When an organization faces such demands, the first thing they should do
is contact law enforcement agencies and computer security specialists.
Even if a ransom is paid, the cybercriminals may still not fulfil their promise,
as was the case with the ProtonMail DDoS attack that continued after a
ransom was paid.

EVOLUTION OF CYBER THREATS IN THE CORPORATE SECTOR

PREDICTIONS
Growing numbers of attacks against financial organizations, financial
fraud on exchange markets
In the coming year, we expect to see growing numbers of attacks
launched against financial organizations, as well as a difference in the
quality of these attacks. Besides transferring money to their own accounts
and converting it to cash, we may also see cybercriminals employing
some new techniques. These could include data manipulation on trading
platforms where both traditional and new financial instruments, such as
cryptocurrencies, are traded.
Attacks on infrastructure
Even if an organization is difficult to penetrate, it is now typical for
organizations to store their valuable data on servers located in data centers
rather than on the infrastructure located on their own premises. Attempts
to gain unauthorized access to these outsourced components of a
company’s infrastructure will become an important attack vector in 2016.
Exploiting IoT vulnerabilities to penetrate corporate networks
IoT (Internet of Things) devices can be found in almost every corporate
network. Research conducted in 2015 has shown that there are a number
of security problems with these devices and cybercriminals are likely to
exploit them because they offer a convenient foothold at the initial stage
of penetrating a corporate network.
More rigid security standards, cooperation with law enforcement
agencies
In response to the growing number of computer incidents in business
environments and the changes to the overall cyber-threat landscape,
regulatory authorities will develop new security standards and update
those already in effect. Organizations that are interested in the integrity
and security of their digital values will cooperate more actively with
law enforcement agencies, or find themselves obliged to do so by the
standards mentioned above. This may lead to more concerted efforts to
catch cybercriminals, so expect to hear about new arrests in 2016.

19

KASPERSKY SECURITY BULLETIN 2015

WHAT TO DO?
In 2015, we have seen cybercriminals begin to actively use APT attack
methods to penetrate company networks. We are talking here about
reconnaissance that aims to identify weak spots in a corporate infrastructure
and gathering information about employees. There is also the use of spear
phishing and waterhole attacks, the active use of exploits to execute code
and gain administrator rights, the use of legitimate software along with
Trojans for remote administration, research of the targeted network and
abuse of password restoration software. All this requires the development
of methods and techniques to protect corporate networks.
As for specific recommendations, the TOP 35 cyber-intrusion mitigation
strategies developed by the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) should be
consulted first of all. Through comprehensive, detailed analysis of local
attacks and threats, ASD has found that at least 85% of targeted cyber
intrusions could be mitigated by four basic strategies. Three of them are
related to specialized security solutions. Kaspersky Lab products include
technological solutions to cover the first three major strategies.
Below is a list of the four basic strategies that reduce the possibility of a
successful targeted attack:
•
•
•
•

Use application whitelisting to help prevent malicious software and
unapproved programs from running
Patch applications such as Java, PDF viewers, Flash, web browsers
and Microsoft Office
Patch operating system vulnerabilities
Restrict administrative privileges to operating systems and applications,
based on user duties.

For detailed information about the ASD mitigation strategies, consult the
threat mitigation article in the Securelist encyclopedia.
Another important factor is the use of the latest threat data, i.e. threat
intelligence services (Kaspersky Lab, for example, provides its own Kaspersky
Intelligence Service). A timely configuration and checkup of the corporate
network using this data will help protect against attacks or detect an attack
at an early stage.

20

EVOLUTION OF CYBER THREATS IN THE CORPORATE SECTOR

The basic principles of ensuring security in corporate networks remain
unchanged:
•

•
•

Train staff. Maintaining information security is not only the job of
the corporate security service but also the responsibility of every
employee.
Organize security procedures. The corporate security system must
provide an adequate response to evolving threats.
Use new technologies and methods. Each added layer of protection
helps reduce the risk of intrusion.
