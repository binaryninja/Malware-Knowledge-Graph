Operation Kingphish: Uncovering a
Campaign of Cyber Attacks against Civil
Society in Qatar and Nepal
Over the course of 2016 — and particularly intensifying towards the
end of the year — several individuals known to Amnesty International
were approached via email and through social media by “Safeena
Malik”, seemingly an enthusiastic activist with a strong interest in
human rights. What lied beneath this facade was a well-engineered
campaign of phishing attacks designed to steal credentials and spy on
the activity of dozens of journalists, human rights defenders, trade
unions and labour rights activists, many of whom are seemingly
involved in the issue of migrants’ rights in Qatar and Nepal.
Our investigation of the attacks didn’t yield any evidence that would
indicate the conclusive responsibility of a particular government,
although we suspect these attacks might have been orchestrated by a
state-aﬃliated actor. We refer to this campaign and the associated
actor as Operation Kingphish (“Malik”, in one of its written forms in
Arabic, translates to “King”).
It is worth noting that in December 2016, Amnesty International
published an investigation into another social engineering campaign
perpetrated by a seemingly fake human rights organization known as
Voiceless Victims, which targeted international human rights and
labour rights organizations campaigning on migrant workers’ rights in
Qatar. While there is a clear alignment of interests, we have found no
evidence to suggest these two campaigns are directly connected.

Migrants’ rights in Qatar
Migrant workers, mainly from South Asia, comprise more than 90% of
Qatar’s workforce, with Nepalis being one of the largest nationalities.
The exploitation of migrant workers in Qatar, particularly in the
construction sector, has been widely reported on since Qatar won the
right to host the 2022 World Cup. The sponsorship system, which ties

migrant workers to their employers has been widely criticized as
being a major driver of exploitation.

Qatar: World Cup 2022 forced labour

As Amnesty International reported, recent changes to laws governing
the migrant labour system in Qatar barely scratch the surface of the
problem and continue to leave migrant workers, including those
building stadiums and infrastructure for the World Cup, at the mercy
of exploitative bosses and at risk of serious human rights abuses
including forced labour. Workers still require exit permits to leave the
country, which can still be blocked by their employer, and employers
can now legally keep hold of their workers’ passports under a new
loophole which can be easily exploited.

“Safeena Malik” phishing expedition

Note: throughout the report we have redacted, where necessary, names
and email addresses of individuals and organizations targeted in order to
protect their identity and safety. We have also obscured wherever possible
the pictures utilized by the attackers on the fake social media proﬁles, as
they have been likely stolen from people with no involvement in these
attacks.
Our investigation revealed that unidentiﬁed attackers have
purposefully created and maintained what appears to be a fake online
persona, named “Safeena Malik”, in order to regularly engage in
conversations with the selected targets, and at diﬀerent times and
with diﬀerent pretenses try to lure them into giving away their
credentials to their Gmail account through the use of phishing attacks.
Phishing is a hacking technique that often consists of mimicking
popular online services (such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, and
Linkedin) and credibly replicating their login pages, with the goal of
stealing usernames and passwords from the designated victims by
luring them into mistakenly authenticating through such pages.
This type of attack is extremely popular, and often used against
members of civil society. It is relatively easy and cheap to orchestrate,
and if successful it grants the attackers access to victims’ personal and
professional email accounts, which can obviously reveal very sensitive
information. For example, having an activist’s email account phished
might lead to the reconstruction of their network, exposure of sources’
identities, as well as abuse of their accounts for impersonation. By
comparison, phishing attacks are likely signiﬁcantly more common
than malware attacks.
Phishing attacks are normally delivered through emails soliciting the
target to open a link and login to, for example, a Google-like page.
The strategies used to make this solicitation credible can vary. Often,
for example, the email would falsely inform the victim that their
account has been hacked, urgently requiring a password reset.

“Safeena Malik” has a full presence on social media but her twitter
account, created in December 2014 has only one visible tweet, dating
from 23 December 2014, a simple “hi”. We believe it is possible that
the operators of Operation Kingphish might have acquired a set of
pre-registered (or stolen) social media proﬁles online. The accounts
“Safeena Malik” follows show a clear pattern: a large number of
Middle East-based journalists for international publications, staﬀ of
international human rights organizations and trade unions, and
various campaigns for migrants’ rights in Qatar.
Their Facebook account appears to be more active, and their LinkedIn
proﬁle, has 500+ connections.
The various social media accounts communicated regularly with
several of the victims we identiﬁed, often for many months. It appears
that the attackers may have impersonated the identity of a real young
woman and stole her pictures to construct the fake proﬁle, along with
a professional biography also stolen from yet another person. The
emails and messages sent by the fake “Safeena Malik” would normally
be timed around — before, and following — the delivery of yet another
attempt at phishing the credentials of the designated victims.

Case 1: Fake Google, real Google
For example, in the exchange below, “Safeena” tried to lure the target
by purporting to be seeking help on some important research on
human traﬃcking.

In the course of this email correspondence, the attacker — “Safeena”
— then sent what appeared to be invitations to access several
documents on Google Drive.

The links and buttons contained in the emails would direct the victim
to a webpage that looked something like this:

Note: the pro le picture has been manipulated to protect the identity of the target.

The page is designed to mimic a standard Google login page, with a
high degree of accuracy. While most common phishing pages would
only provide an empty form to enter an email address and password,
this one instead is conﬁgured to display the proﬁle picture, the
account name, and the email address of the victim. This is obscured in
the above screenshot to protect the privacy of the victim.
This design eﬀectively replicates a real Google login page, which
would similarly display the same information if you had previously
logged into your account from a computer. The attackers were
meticulous in making their phishing page as credible as possible.
Interestingly, after the victims would have entered their Google
account credentials, they would be redirected to an actual document
hosted on Google Drive, eﬀectively recreating a normal browsing
experience in order to avoid suspicion. In the example below, the
target would have been redirected to a PowerPoint presentation on
human traﬃcking. Amnesty has identiﬁed that this presentation had
also been stolen from another source.

Case 2: Making friends and connections
Among the targets of this campaign is the International Trade Union
Confederation (ITUC). ITUC is a trade union federation based in
Brussels and among the largest in the world, counting over 170
million members. ITUC has been very outspoken in recent years about
migrant labour rights in Qatar, and is behind the “Re-Run the Vote!”
campaign against the award of the organization of the 2022 FIFA
World Cup to Qatar.
Both in the attacks against ITUC and in other occasions, the attackers
approached selected targets over social media, prominently Facebook,
and engaged in chat conversations with them on and oﬀ, sometimes
over a period of several months. At times the attackers behind the
proﬁle would just have a short casual conversation, while at others
they attempted an attack. Possibly in order to identify further targets,
“Safeena Malik” found her way into several Facebook groups dealing
with migrant workers and forced labour.

Similarly to attempts described previously, in this case the attackers
also invited the targets to open a document seemingly shared on
Google Drive. This time the document purported to be about the
involvement of the Emir of Qatar in funding ISIS, which was
seemingly copied from a website critical of Qatar.

Once the target would provide their credentials through the fake
Google login page, they would also be automatically redirected to an
existing document hosted on the legitimate Google Drive.

While it might not appear signiﬁcant, this attention to detail is what,
in our experience, sets apart these phishing attempts from more
common ones, as they demonstrate a level of experience and care that
is both unusual and remarkable.

Case 3: Hanging out
Similar tactics are exempliﬁed by yet another case we’ve become
aware of and portrayed in the picture below, where the fake “Safeena
Malik” proﬁle is conversing with a prominent activist from Nepal
working on migrant workers issues, soliciting them to give away their
Gmail address.

Interestingly, the attackers tried to leverage common Facebook friends
in an attempt to convince the target of their legitimacy. This is a tactic
we’ve observed the attackers utilize on numerous occasions across
their conversations with some of the targets we know of, which
explains the time and eﬀort spent in building a large social graph.
In this case, the attackers very credibly pretended to have been
inviting the targets to participate in a Google Hangout (a
videoconferencing service operated by Google).

Again, when clicking on the button the target would be presented
with a Google-like login page.

Note: the pro le picture has been manipulated to protect the identity of the target.

. . .

Identifying the Victims
While we ﬁrst learned of these attacks through a journalist who was
targeted, we soon learned of many others.
What we discovered, is that the phishing pages are in fact
“conﬁgurable”. The links sent via email to the targets contains all the
required information for the phishing page to load the appropriate
proﬁle picture and names.
For example, a link would look like this (please note that the links have
been edited to disable any accidental clicks and redacted to protect the
victim’s privacy):

hxxp://rqeuset.hanguot.g-puls.viwe.accnnoutloookout.auditi.devisionial-checlkout.inistructiionmutuael.halftoine.appliacctiorn-gurad-way.leigacy-fs.termpforn.provider-saefe.alvie-valuse.tokencenteir.recollect.label.ping2port[.]info/?ml=

[REDACTED]&Re3d=aHR0cDovL3Rpbnl1cmwuY29tL2g5d3h3cDg=&pa=2&gp
=1

In the URL there are some encoded values passed to the webpage,
which decode to the following:

hxxp://rqeuset.hanguot.g-puls.viwe.accnnoutloookout.auditi.devisionial-checlkout.inistructiionmutuael.halftoine.appliacctiorn-gurad-way.leigacy-fs.termpforn.provider-saefe.alvie-valuse.tokencenteir.recollect.label.ping2port[.]info/?ml=[REDACTED]&n@e=
[REDACTED]&P4t=//ping2port.info/[REDACTED]/[REDACTED].jpg&Re
3d=http://tinyurl.com/h9wxwp8&pa=2&gp=1

The ﬁrst value is the email address of the target, the second is the
account name (most often the full real name of the intended target),
the third value is an address pointing to a copy of the target’s proﬁle
picture pulled from their Google+ or YouTube proﬁle, and the last is a
link to which the victim will be redirected after their credentials have
been successfully stolen.
The stolen proﬁle pictures would be stored on the server owned by
the attackers. Interestingly, their ﬁlename and location were
predictable as they would be normally saved in a particular folder
with a ﬁlename that would be a combination of two lower-case letters.
For example:
hxxp://ping2port[.]info/[REDACTED]/xx.jpg (this particular
ﬁlename is ﬁctional, and the URL has been disabled to prevent misclicks).
As we noticed that this pattern was repeated across a couple of
attacks that came to our attention, we realized we might be able to
identify additional victims by regularly attempting to download all the
available proﬁle pictures stored with all the 676 possible combinations
of two-letter ﬁlenames. Once we obtained new proﬁle pictures, a
simple image search online could reveal the identity behind these
victims.
Surely enough, it allowed us to identify nearly 30 distinct targets.
Most identiﬁed targets were activists, journalists, and labour union
members. While some of targets had published critical opinions about
Qatar’s international aﬀairs, the majority of identiﬁed targets were

aﬃliated with organisations supporting migrant workers in Qatar.
Interestingly, a signiﬁcant number of them are from Nepal, which is
one of the largest nationalities amongst migrant workers in Qatar, and
a country that has featured prominently in the migrant worker
narrative on Qatar.
We learned however of several more targets who appeared to not
have been conﬁgured with a stored proﬁle picture, so it is possible
that the number of actual targets was far larger. Through our
conversations with identiﬁed targets it became clear that “Safeena
Malik” often approached members of thematic Facebook groups and
asked for information and contact details about further targets we
were not originally aware of.

. . .

Who is behind the attacks?
We don’t have conclusive evidence that could implicate any particular
government or individual as being responsible for these attacks, but
the fact that the campaign speciﬁcally targets individuals active on
human rights issues in Qatar, makes us believe that it might be a
state-sponsored or aﬃliated actor. We believe it is also possible that
these attacks have been orchestrated by contractors. In fact, similar
intelligence gathering operations uncovered in other GCC countries,
have shown a reliance on outsourcing this work to private ﬁrms.
Interestingly, the attackers logged into some of the harvested email
accounts from the IP address 178.152.139.XXX [last octet redacted] as
these Gmail recent activity records display:

This IP address appears to be an Internet connection provided by
Ooredoo, an Internet Service Provider with headquarters in Doha,

Qatar.

Note: the geographical mapping of an IP address is often very approximate, and while it indicates that the
attackers used a connection in Doha, the coordinates, which were provided by the free MaxMind service should
not to be considered to be a precise location.

We wrote to the Government of Qatar with information about this
phishing campaign and asking about their possible involvement. They
responded, vigorously denying any link to the attacks. (We should
note that Amnesty International was not one of the targets of this
campaign.)

The Government of Qatar also expressed their interest in stopping the
phishing attacks.

We also wrote to “Safeena Malik” on the Gmail address used to
contact targets. We summarized our ﬁndings and asked for a
response. We similarly contacted the Facebook account used in the
attacks. As of publication, we have not received any reply.

While there is a clear underlying Qatar migrant workers theme in this
campaign, it is also hypothetically possible that these attacks could
have been perpetrated by a malicious actor aﬃliated to a diﬀerent
government with an interest in damaging the reputation of the State
of Qatar.
However, in the absence of clear evidence, trying to identify the entity
behind this attack can only be speculative. As such, we cannot make
any conclusive attribution.

. . .

Have I been targeted too?
Following is a Gmail query to search for speciﬁc keywords that we
believe are unique to the malicious emails sent by the “Safeena Malik”
proﬁle.

You can copy and paste it in the search bar at the top of your Gmail
window like so:

If you have received any emails related to this campaign, Gmail
should ﬁlter them from your inbox and highlight them to you.

Some tips to protect yourself
against phishing
Be careful with links: before clicking a link or button on an email
check where it is redirecting you to. You can usually do this by

https://medium.com/amnesty-insights/operation-kingphish-uncovering-a-campaign-of-cyber-attacks-against-civil-society-in-qatar-and-aa40c9e08852#.l4pdvdg...

hovering your mouse pointer over the link or button; you can also ﬁnd
out by right-clicking and copying the link. If an email tells you it’s
taking you to Facebook or Gmail but the link doesn’t look like like a
Facebook or Google address, then there might be something wrong. If
you’re not sure, type the address yourself and log in.
Enable two-factor authentication: two-factor authentication is an
extra step you need to log-in to your account. In most cases, it’s very
simple and you only need to do it when you use a new device or once
every few weeks. Most commonly you will be required to provide a
six-digit code delivered through your phone either through an SMS
message, or preferably through a mobile app, like Google
Authenticator, Authy or Duo Mobile. While it might appear tedious at
ﬁrst, this process makes it a lot harder to hack your online accounts,
as your passwords alone wouldn’t be suﬃcient to access them.
Many popular services have two-factor authentication, including
Gmail, Outlook, Facebook and Twitter. You can read more details on
two-factor authentication here.
Be wary of strangers: if someone you don’t know contacts you and
starts asking you for personal details, contact details and names of
people you know, treat it with suspicion. A simple rule is: if you
wouldn’t share it on twitter, don’t share information with someone
you don’t know, even if it is someone who appears to have friends on
social media in common with you. As we learned from this campaign,
attackers do commonly befriend many people to leverage common
social connections as a way to appear more credible and legitimate.
