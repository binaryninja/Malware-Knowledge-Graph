AI Squared, a small, mission-driven tech firm based in a verdant corner of Vermont, builds
software that alters websites to help those with visual impairment use the internet. It never
expected to become an innocent victim in an international cyberespionage campaign
allegedly perpetrated by Iran.
But AI Squared is now living proof that any American business, be it Microsoft-sized or a
minnow, is a potential victim of Iran's increasingly sophisticated and prolific digital army.
Indeed, AI Squared has become the only known private American business to have been
targeted by a young crew from Iran known as OilRig. Since its birth in late 2015, OilRig has
become one of the most active hacking organizations to be sponsored by the Iranian
government, according to cybersecurity experts and to U.S. and Israeli intelligence firms.
FORBES is revealing a handful of its targets for the first time on Wednesday, showing its
rapid infiltration of systems across the globe in little over a year.

While most Iranian groups have typically targeted a niche set of domestic and foreign
targets, in particular government agencies and dissidents, OilRig is far more focused on
private industry outside of Iran. "What's interesting about OilRig is how much it's just foreign
focused and is interested in the private sector as much as it's interested in the diplomatic
establishment," said Collin Anderson, a Washington D.C.-based researcher who is drawing
up a report for Carnegie Mellon on Iran's overall cyber power. And though it's unclear just
what data OilRig has siphoned off target systems, the unit is representative of a shift in Iran's
cyber strategy, from destructive attacks, such as the infamous hit on the Las Vegas Sands
Casino in 2014, to stealthy monitoring of targets.
An American platform for attack
AI Squared's problems started in the second week of January, when the company received a
startling warning from security giant Symantec: Certificates for its technology that are
designed to guarantee its authenticity had been compromised. What Symantec didn’t say,
and what AI Squared is now investigating after FORBES’ disclosed the Iranian link to the
company, was that OilRig was believed to have been responsible.
The crew stole AI Squared certificates and used them to disguise their own malware. The
goal was to make their surveillance tools appear legitimate to security systems of their many
targets across the Middle East, Europe and the U.S., as noted in a report from Israeli
security provider ClearSky in early January. The OilRig hackers pushed those espionage
tools over two fake Oxford University pages in November 2016, one claiming to offer jobs at
the institution, the other a conference sign-up website, ClearSky said. Both encouraged
visitors to download documents, one to complete registration for the fake event, the other for
an Oxford University CV creator. Once clicked, the crew's malware, named Helminth, would
run, allowing the OilRig crew to control targets’ PCs and steal data.

AI Squared, owned by Florida-based VFO Group since a June 2016 acquisition, only
received vague details on the compromise from Symantec and is only now launching an
investigation. "Could someone else have hacked into our systems? We’re pretty secure here,
but they hacked the White House, they can hack anywhere they want," said Scott Moore,
marketing VP at VFO Group, which claims to be "the world's leading assistive technology
provider for the visually impaired." The company is yet to find any conclusive findings.
Gunning for government officials
Many other organizations have become victims of OilRig's crew in recent years. Intelligence
firms believe OilRig has taken control of multiple email accounts of public and private
organizations. With that access, they’ve expanded their phishing campaigns in the U.S.,
Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and beyond.

One OilRig phishing email viewed by FORBES, dated July 2016, was addressed to three
officials at Turkey’s foreign ministry. They included an adviser to the Permanent Mission of
Turkey to the United Nations, based in New York, a staffer at the Turkish embassy staff in
Riga, Latvia, and another official based in Turkey. It was sent from an official Turkish Airlines
check-in address, indicating the hackers had either compromised the airline’s email or
spoofed the account. The message encouraged the recipient to provide login details via an
attached Excel file. Once opened, the group’s Helminth malware would run.
The Turkish adviser in New York said he had never seen the phishing email and so couldn’t
have clicked on the link. At the time of publication, the other targets had not responded to
multiple requests for comment. Turkish Airlines also had not returned requests. Despite the
phishing email itself showing who OilRig was trying to expose, it’s not known if either
organization was successfully hacked.
But similar malicious documents were sent to multiple other government organizations
across the world, according to Palo Alto Networks, which first published the phishing email
without naming the parties involved.
Private industry attacks
OilRig has gone after multiple private companies too. Another phish was attempted in May
2016 by the hackers that, according to the metadata in the email headers, was sent from
servers within Saudi Arabian government contractor and IT security supplier Al-Elm. That
could indicate a breach at Al-Elm, according to the security researcher who showed
FORBES the email.
The message was injected into an ongoing email thread between Al-Elm and Samba, part of
the Samba Financial Group, the kingdom's third largest lender that reported $290 million
profit last quarter. The message contained a version of OilRig’s Helminth surveillance kit,
which would launch as soon as a recipient opened an attached document, in this case an
Excel file called “notes.xls.” Neither Al-Elm nor Samba had responded to requests for
comment.
According to a report released Wednesday by cyber intelligence firm SecureWorks, which
has dubbed the OilRig crew Cobalt Gypsy, the group was active this January, sending out
messages loaded with malware from legitimate email addresses belonging to one of Saudi
Arabia's biggest IT suppliers, the National Technology Group, and an Egyptian IT services
firm, ITWorx. From those email accounts, an unnamed Middle East entity was targeted with
messages promising links to job offers. Hidden in the attachments was PupyRAT, an open
source remote access trojan (RAT) that works across Android, Linux and Windows platforms.

used as a lure.

Neither the National Technology Group nor ITWorx had responded to requests for comment.
Just as in the case of Al-Elm, analysis of the headers of the phishing emails indicated they
originated from within the sender’s organization, and were not spoofed, SecureWorks said.
That indicated "the threat actor previously compromised those organizations," according to
SecureWorks intelligence analyst Allison Wikoff.
The SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit has repeatedly informed its customers across
government and private sector with “high confidence” that OilRig “is associated with Iranian
government-directed cyber operations.” CrowdStrike, which dubs the group Twisted Kitten,
has connected it with Iran too. And Israeli firm ClearSky has also traced the crew back to the
Middle East nation.
"They're very active, possibly the most active group [in Iran]," said Rafe Pilling, security
researcher at SecureWorks. "They are capable and have demonstrated that capability to
leverage their phishing ops."
The Iranian government hadn't responded to a request for comment on the OilRig group at
the time of publication. In the past, Iran has denied involvement in cyberespionage and
digital attacks on foreign systems.
Iran's freewheeling cyber spies
Outside of OilRig, other reports of Iranian activity have caused alarm across the security
community in the last year, for both their sophistication and their novelty. One of only a
handful of Mac malware samples was attributed to the Iranian government earlier this month.
Just last year, the U.S. indicted seven Iranians for their alleged participation in an attacks on
U.S. financial institutions. One was also charged with an attempt to hack the Bowman Dam
in New York. The accused reside in Iran and are not expected to be extradited to stand trial.
Iran denied involvement in the attacks.
Anderson, who uncovered the Mac malware, said Iran had created a hodgepodge of
hackers, some of whom were capable of causing severe harm. “It's chaotic, five or six-man
shops that produce mediocre malware,” said Anderson, who tracks a substantial amount of
Iran cyber activity with fellow researcher Claudio Guarnieri. “Sometimes they do some
catastrophic damage, most of the time not so much.”
U.S. cyber experts are now looking at how OilRig and its sister crews will respond to the
Trump administration's stance on Iran, which will be looking at how the president's meeting
with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. "The Iranians are being cautious about
provoking the US until they see how the Trump administration lines up on Iran policy," said
James Lewis, an intelligence and security specialist at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies. "Let’s see what happens with the Netanyahu visit."
