CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

European Energy Sector
Organization Targeted by
PupyRAT Malware in Late 2019
By Insikt Group®

CTA-2020-0123

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

This report is based on proprietary Recorded Future network traffic analysis of RAT
controllers detected using signatures developed by Insikt Group researchers. The
period of analysis covers November 28, 2019 through January 5, 2020.
This report will primarily be of interest to SOC analysts and threat intelligence
professionals in organizations operating in the energy sector who are conducting threat
hunting assignments relating to malware used by Iranian nation-state threat actors.

Over the course of the last year, Recorded Future research has
demonstrated that Iran-nexus groups, possibly including APT33
(also called Elfin), have been prolific in amassing operational network
infrastructure throughout 2019. Additionally, in November 2019,
Microsoft disclosed that APT33 had shifted focus from targeting
IT networks to physical control systems used in electric utilities,
manufacturing, and oil refineries. We also documented statesponsored Iran-nexus groups making heavy use of freely available
commodity malware for active network intrusions. These tools are
usually intended to be used for defensive red-teaming exercises.
One such tool used by several Iran-nexus groups is PupyRAT.
Using Recorded Future remote access trojan (RAT) controller
detections and network traffic analysis techniques, Insikt
Group identified a PupyRAT command and control (C2) server
communicating with a mail server for a European energy sector
organization from late November 2019 until at least January 5,
2020. While metadata alone does not confirm a compromise, we
assess that the high volume and repeated communications from
the targeted mail server to a PupyRAT C2 are sufficient to indicate
a likely intrusion.
PupyRAT is an open source RAT available on Github, and according
to the developer, it is a “cross-platform, multi-function RAT and
post-exploitation tool mainly written in Python.” It has been used
previously by Iranian groups APT33 (Elfin, Magic Hound, HOLMIUM)
and COBALT GYPSY (which overlaps with APT34/OilRig).
Although this commodity RAT, PupyRAT, is known to have been
used by Iranian threat actor groups APT33 and COBALT GYPSY, we
cannot confirm whether the PupyRAT controller we identified is
used by either Iranian group. Whoever the attacker is, the targeting
of a mail server at a high-value critical infrastructure organization
could give an adversary access to sensitive information on energy
allocation and resourcing in Europe.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

The targeting of a key organization in the European energy sector is
of particular interest given their role in the coordination of European
energy resources. Iranian groups (and others) have targeted a wide
variety of industries in the U.S. and Europe, with recent reporting
indicating an increase in the targeting of energy sector industrial
control software.
We emphasize that this activity predates the recent escalation of
kinetic activity between the U.S. and Iran, and therefore likely relates
to espionage-motivated intrusion activity or the prepositioning of
network access within a high-value network in the European energy
sector.
To defend against commodity RATs such as PupyRAT and others,
Recorded Future recommends that organizations:
• Monitor for sequential login attempts from the same IP
against different accounts. This type of activity is more
difficult to detect than traditional brute forcing, but will
help insulate organizations from a favored tactic of cyber
operators.
• Introduce multi-factor authentication. This has proven to be
a highly effective mitigation practice for many organizations
that have historically experienced a high level of credential
stuffing and password-spraying attacks.
• Use a password manager and set a unique strong password
for each online account.
• Analyze and cross-reference log data. This may help to detect
incidents involving high-frequency lockouts, unsanctioned
remote access attempts, temporal attack overlaps across
multiple user accounts, and fingerprint unique web browser
agent information.
