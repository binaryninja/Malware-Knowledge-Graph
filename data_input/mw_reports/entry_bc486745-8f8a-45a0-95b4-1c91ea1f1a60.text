Businesses today pride themselves on responding quickly to changing conditions.
Unfortunately, cybercriminals aren’t any different. A newly discovered malware
family hitting point-of-sale (PoS) systems has been found which emphasizes speed in
how the information is stolen and sent back to attackers. We called this attack
FastPOS, due to the speed and efficiency of its credit card theft capabilities.

FastPOS is designed to immediately exfiltrate any stolen card data, instead of storing
it locally in a file and periodically sending it to the attackers. This suggests that it may
have been designed to target situations with a much smaller network environment.
An example would be where the primary network gateway is a simple DSL modem
with ports forwarded to the POS system.

Arrival and Targets
FastPOS (which we detect as TSPY_FASTPOS.SMZTDA) reaches its would-be targets via
three methods:
Links to a compromised medical site talking about laser surgical techniques
A real-time file sharing service
Direct file transfer via VNC
The first two methods imply some sort of social engineering necessary to get users to
run the malware; the last implies either a compromise of company credentials of
some sort or brute-forcing of the necessary user names and password.
The victims of this particular threat were widely distributed: we identified victims from
various parts of the world. By region, these were:
Americas: Brazil and the United Sates
Asia: Hong Kong, Japan, and Taiwan
Europe: France

Figure 1. Industries and countries of FastPOS victims
The industries of these varied as well. One victim in the United States was a veterinary
clinic; targets elsewhere included companies in the food and logistics sectors. In
some of these cases, the victim locations were remote offices that contained open
VNC access.

Information Theft
FastPOS focuses on immediately sending any stolen information to the attacker,
instead of storing it locally and uploading it at intervals. While this may result in some
errant network activity, given today’s devices (which are constantly connected)
this sort of activity is relatively easy to hide. It does this for both methods of information
theft it uses: key logging and RAM scraping.
The implementation of the key logger is similar to the version found in NewPOSThings.
The logged keystrokes are not stored in a file on the affected system; instead they are
stored in memory. They are transmitted to the attacker once the Enter key is pressed.
Depending on the procedures of the victim business, the stolen information can
include user credentials, personally identifiable information (PII) of customers and
staff, all the way to payment information. (To help attackers figure out which is which,

the title of the window where these keystrokes were stolen from is also logged and
included with the data.)
The RAM scraper is designed to steal only credit card information. A series of checks
are meant to ensure that the RAM scraper is able to steal valid card numbers.
One feature of this RAM scraper that is not in common use elsewhere is the
verification of the card’s service code. A card with either the 101 or 201 service
codes can be used normally around the world. The only difference is that the 201
service code specifies that the on-board chip of newer EMV cards must be used,
where feasible. Cards that require PINs for transactions are also excluded.

Data exfiltration
As we mentioned earlier, FastPOS does not store any information or status logs locally.
Instead, any stolen information is immediately uploaded to a C&C server, the
location of which is hardcoded inside the malware. This goes both for logged
keystrokes as well as any information from the RAM scraper.

How the information is uploaded is also slightly unusual. They are sent as parameters
to the C&C server’s URL, as seen below:

Figure 2. URL of sample traffic back to C&C server
This particular example sent back RAM scraper data. The two exfiltration commands
are as follows:
key&log=TWND%sKWND%s
add&log=%s&foundin=%s

Used to send the logged keystrokes. First
string is the window title; second string is
the key log
Used by the RAM Scraper thread during
data exfiltration. First string is the card
dump; second string is the process name.

Table 1. Exfiltration commands
Similarly, logs and system information are sent with the following commands:
Registers new
infected system
with user name,
new&username=%s&computername=%s&os=%s&architecture=%s computer name,
OS and
architecture

statuslog&log=CheckedForUpdate

statuslog=&log=GetLastError%d

Table 2. Other commands
The use of GET could be considered unusual. The GET command is normally used to
retrieve files, whereas the POST command is used to send information to a server. In
this particular case, that doesn’t appear to be the case. The C&C server replies with
the standard HTTP 200 response. One possibility is that the use of a GET command is
designed to cause fewer suspicions – after all, this is the same command used when
any browser retrieves a website.
One more thing to note – the non-usage of HTTPS here means that the victim’s data
is sent “in the clear”, without any encryption whatsoever. This means they could
easily be stolen by other threat actors capable of intercepting network traffic,
making the user a victim twice over.

Who created FastPOS, and who uses it?
With any threat like this we’re usually asked something along the lines of who wrote
this malware, and who uses it in the wild. While we don’t have definite answers,
there are some interesting hints.
Posts on a forum from 2015 showed that a user was posting code samples for
malware that used the same mutex as our FastPOS samples:

Figure 3. Request for help, with mutex
Coincidence? It could be. However, note the above strings in the code for sending
keystrokes: KWND and TWND. Those also show up in other posts by the same user:

Figure 4. Request for help, with unique strings (Click to enlarge)
What about who uses it? We can get some clues from this particular advertisement:

Figure 5. Advertisement (Click to enlarge)
This particular ad is for a site where other users can buy stolen card information. What
is unusual is that we found that this site’s IP address was used by FastPOS itself as a
C&C server! In short, the persons behind FastPOS are selling stolen credentials via the
same server they use to receive these credentials.
Our technical brief contains more details about this threat, including: a timeline of its
development, more technical details, as well as a summary of the card information
that was sold.

Conclusions
FastPOS’s design sets it apart from other POS malware families. It appears to be
designed to operate in situations where a large, enterprise-scale network may not be
present: instead, it is designed for environments with a much smaller footprint. This
could be cases where the primary network gateway is a simple DSL modem with
ports forwarded to the POS system. In such a situation, the target would rely almost
exclusively on endpoint detection and less so on network-level detection.

One solution for victims would be to adapt endpoint application control or
whitelisting, which reduces attack exposure by ensuring only updates associated with
whitelisted applications can be installed. Advanced endpoint solutions such as Trend
Micro™ Security, Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Suites, and Trend Micro Worry-Free™
Business Security can protect users systems have features that can help combat
point-of-sale threats.
