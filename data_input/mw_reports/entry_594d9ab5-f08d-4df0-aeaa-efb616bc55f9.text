New MacOS Backdoor Connected to OceanLotus Surfaces

We recently discovered a new backdoor we believe to be related to the OceanLotus group. Some of the updates of this new variant (detected
by Trend Micro as Backdoor.MacOS.OCEANLOTUS.F) include new behavior and domain names. As of writing, this sample is still undetected
by other antimalware solutions.
Due to similarities in dynamic behavior and code with previous OceanLotus samples, it was confirmed to be a variant of the said malware.

OceanLotus was responsible for targeted attacks against organizations from industries such as media, research, and construction. Recently
they have also been discovered by researchers from Volexity to be using malicious websites to propagate malware.
The attackers behind this sample are suspected to target users from Vietnam since the document’s name is in Vietnamese and the older
samples targeted the same region before.

Arrival
The sample arrives as an app bundled in a Zip archive. It uses the icon for a Word document file as a disguise, attempting to pass itself off as
a legitimate document file.

Figure 3. The sample’s file name, icon, and app bundle structure

Another technique it uses to evade detection is adding special characters to its app bundle name. When a user looks for the fake doc folder via
the macOS Finder app or the terminal command line, the folder's name shows "ALL tim nha Chi Ngoc Canada.doc" (“tìm nhà Chị Ngọc”
roughly translates to “find Mrs. Ngoc’s house”). However, checking the original Zip file that contains the folder shows 3 unexpected bytes
between "." and "doc".

Figure 4. Special character between ‘.’ and ‘doc’ as

viewed inside the zip archive.
The 3 bytes "efb880" is in UTF-8 encoding. According to UTF-8 mapping, the related Unicode code is "U+FE00".

Table 1. UTF-8 mapping
"U+FE00" is a special Unicode control character with name variation selector-1, which provides the visual appearance of a CJK compatibility
ideograph. In this case, the preceding character is the general character ".", so the variation selector does not change the visual appearance.
The operating system sees the app bundle as an unsupported directory type, so as a default action the “open” command is used to execute
the malicious app. Otherwise, if the postfix is .doc without special characters, Microsoft Word is called to open the app bundle as a document;
but since it is not a valid document, the app fails to open it.
Here is the code signing information for the app bundle sample.

The app bundle contains two notable files:
ALL tim nha Chi Ngoc Canada: The shell script containing the main malicious routines
configureDefault.def: The word file displayed during execution

Figure 6. Contents of “ALL tim nha Chi Ngoc Canada” file

Figure 7. The document displayed after executing the

file
When the shell script was run, it performed the following routines:
1)

Delete the file quarantine attribute for the files in "*ALL tim nha Chi Ngoc Canada.?doc*”

2)

Attempt to remove file quarantine attribute of the files in the system.

3)
Copy "ALL tim nha Chi Ngoc Canada.?doc/Contents/Resources/configureDefault.def(doc)" to "/tmp/ALL tim nha Chi Ngoc
Canada.doc(doc)"
4)

Open "/tmp/ALL tim nha Chi Ngoc Canada.doc(doc)"

5)
Extract the b64-encoded fat binary to "ALL tim nha Chi Ngoc Canada.?doc/Contents/Resources/configureDefault.def(fat - binary)", which
is the second-stage payload
6)

Change access permission of second-stage payload to execute the launch of the second-stage payload

7)

Delete the malware app bundle "ALL tim nha Chi Ngoc Canada.?doc"

8)

Copy "/tmp/ALL tim nha Chi Ngoc Canada.doc(doc)" to "{execution directory}/ALL tim nha Chi Ngoc Canada.doc"

9)

Delete "/tmp/ALL tim nha Chi Ngoc Canada.doc"

Second-stage payload
When executed, the second stage payload (ALL tim nha Chi Ngoc Canada.?doc/Contents/Resources/configureDefault.def) performs the
following malware routines:
1)

Drop third-stage payload to ~/Library/User Photos/mount_devfs

2)

Create persistence for the sample by creating ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.marcoagent.voiceinstallerd.plist

Figure 8. Plist file

~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.marcoagent.voiceinstallerd.plist
3)
Use the touch command to change the timestamp of the sample

4)

Delete itself

Third-stage payload
In the third-stage payload (~/Library/User Photos/mount_devfs), the strings are encrypted with custom encryption using base64 encoding and
byte manipulation.

Like older versions of the OceanLotus backdoor, the new version contains two main functions: one for collecting operating system information
and submitting this to its malicious C&C servers and receiving additional C&C communication information, and another for the backdoor
capabilities.
It collects the following information from the infected system by invoking the following commands:
Command

Description

system_profiler SPHardwareDataType 2>/dev/null | awk '/Processor / {split($0,line,\":\");
printf(\"%s\",line[2]);}'

Get processor information

15f20 = system_profiler SPHardwareDataType 2>/dev/null | awk '/Memory/ {split($0,line, \":\");
printf(\"%s\", line[2]);}'

Get memory information

ioreg -rd1 -c IOPlatformExpertDevice | awk '/IOPlatformSerialNumber/ { split($0, line, \"\\\"\");
printf(\"%s\", line[4]); }

Get serial number

ifconfig -l

Get network interface MAC
addresses

ifconfig <device> | awk '/ether /{print $2}' 2>&1

Table 2. OceanLotus commands and descriptions
The collected information is encrypted and sent to the malware C&C server.

information to C&C server
It also receives commands from the same server.

Here are the C&C servers used by the malware:
mihannevis[.]com
mykessef[.]com
idtpl[.]org
The new variant’s backdoor capabilities are similar to those of the old OceanLotus sample, as detailed in the code excerpts below:

Details about C&C domain names
According to its Google and Whois history, the mihannevis[.]com domain was used to host other websites in the past before it was changed to
a C&C server around the end of August 2020.

The domain name "idtpl[.]org" was registered three years ago, and there was no update history. According to Whois lookup, its register expired
at the end of March 2020.

Recommendations
Threat groups such as OceanLotus are actively updating malware variants in attempts to evade detection and improve persistence. The
