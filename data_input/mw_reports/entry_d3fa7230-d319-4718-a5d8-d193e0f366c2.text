Rocket Kitten or the Rocket Kitten Group is a hacker group thought to be linked to the
Iranian government.[1] The threat actor group has targeted organizations and individuals in
the Middle East, particularly Israel, Saudi Arabia, Iran as well as the United States and
Europe.

Origins
Cybersecurity firm FireEye first identified the group as Ajax Security Team,[2] writing that the
group appears to have been formed in 2010 by the hacker personas "Cair3x" and
"HUrr!c4nE!". By 2012, the threat actor group turned their focus to Iran's political opponents.
[3]
Their targeted attack campaigns, dubbed "Rocket Kitten", have been known since mid2014.[4] By 2013 or 2014, Rocket Kitten had shifted its focus to malware-based
cyberespionage.[3]
Security firm Check Point describes Rocket Kitten as an "attacker group of Iranian origin."[1]
Rocket Kitten's code uses Persian language references. The group's targets are involved in
defense, diplomacy, international affairs, security, policy research, human rights, and
journalism. According to Check Point, the group has targeted Iranian dissidents, the Saudi
royal family, Israeli nuclear scientists and NATO officials. Security researchers found that
they carried out a "common pattern of spearphishing campaigns reflecting the interests and
activities of the Iranian security apparatus."[4] Other researchers determined that Rocket
Kitten's attacks bore a similarity to those attributed to Iran's Revolutionary Guards.[4]
Intelligence officials from the Middle East and Europe linked Rocket Kitten to the Iranian
military establishment.[2] Rocket Kitten favours a Remote Access Trojan,[5] and by 2015,
researchers found it was using customised malware.[2]

History
Operation Saffron Rose
Cybersecurity firm FireEye released a report in 2013 finding that Rocket Kitten had
conducted several cyberespionage operations against United States defense industrial base
companies. The report also detailed the targeting of Iranian citizens who use anti-censorship
tools to bypass Iran's Internet filters.[3]

Operation Woolen-Goldfish

1/6

Trend Micro identified the Operation Woolen-Goldfish campaign in a March 2015 paper. The
campaign included improved spearphishing content.[1]

Oyun
In November 2015, security errors by Rocket Kitten allowed the firm Check Point to gain
password-less root access to "Oyun", the hackers' back-end database. They discovered an
application that was able to generate personalized phishing pages and contained a list of
over 1,842 individual targets.[2][6] Among Rocket Kitten's spearphishing targets from June
2014 to June 2015, 18% were from Saudi Arabia, 17% were from the United States, 16%
were from Iran, 8% were from the Netherlands, and 5% were from Israel.[2] Analysts used
credentials to access key logs of the group's victims and found that Rocket Kitten had
apparently tested their malware on their own workstations and failed to erase the logs from
the data files.[6] Check Point identified an individual named Yaser Balaghi, going by
Wool3n.H4t, as a ringleader of the operation.[5]

Telegram hack
In August 2016, researchers identified Rocket Kitten as being behind a hack of Telegram, a
cloud-based instant messaging service. The hackers exploited Telegram's reliance on SMS
verification, comprising over a dozen accounts and stealing the user IDs and telephone
numbers of 15 million Iranians who use the software. Opposition organizations and reformist
political activists were among the victims.[4]
