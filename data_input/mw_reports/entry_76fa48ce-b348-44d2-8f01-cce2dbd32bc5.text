Chinese State-Sponsored
Group TA413 Adopts New
Capabilities in Pursuit of
Tibetan Targets

THREAT ANALYSIS | CHINA

Key Judgments
• TA413 likely conducts cyber espionage on behalf of
the Chinese state. This assessment is based on the
group’s persistent targeting of the Tibetan community
for intelligence-gathering purposes, use of custom
capabilities shared across other known Chinese statesponsored groups, and other technical evidence
supporting this attribution.
This report details multiple campaigns conducted by the likely Chinese
state-sponsored threat activity group TA413. The activity was identified through a
combination of large-scale automated network traffic analytics and expert analysis.
This report will be of most interest to individuals and organizations with strategic
and operational intelligence requirements relating to Chinese cyber threat activity,
as well as humanitarian and other organizations concerned with Tibetan interests.
With thanks to our colleagues at Sophos for early sharing and collaboration.

Executive Summary

• TA413 is likely a consumer of a shared capability
development pipeline serving multiple Chinese statesponsored groups, exemplified by the group’s continued
use of the Royal Road RTF builder, a shared zero-day
exploit in Sophos Firewall observed in use by multiple
China-linked groups, and historical access to other
shared malware families such as the TClient backdoor.
• In total, we observed at least 3 Chinese state-sponsored
groups targeting Sophos Firewall zero-day vulnerability
CVE-2022-1040. More widely, this activity is further
evidence of both the continued increase in zero-day
use by Chinese state-sponsored actors and the ongoing
sharing of custom capabilities — including exploits —
across groups linked to China’s intelligence agencies.

Recorded Future’s analysts continue to observe targeting
of ethnic and religious minority communities by Chinese statesponsored groups for surveillance and intelligence-gathering
purposes. Previously, we covered activity of this nature that we
attributed to RedAlpha. We have since identified an additional
group that has been particularly relentless in its targeting of

e40096bfd. The unpacked UPX file also loads LOWZERO and
uses the Choopa C2 IP address 45.77.45[.]222 for C2 over
port TCP 110. Notably, 45.77.45[.]222 hosted the domain
tibetyouthcongress[.]com at the time of this activity, which our
analysis also previously attributed to TA413.

Other Tooling in Use by TA413

TTPs aligning with historical public reporting when procuring
and weaponizing operational infrastructure. The group has
predominantly registered domains through GoDaddy and used
a combination of Forewin Telecom, Choopa (Vultr), and Linode
for hosting. Notably, a large majority of identified TA413 domains
also used the registrant organization name “asfasf”, likely due
to consistent keyboard walking of the left hand keyboard home
keys. These TTPs also align with publicly attributed TA413
domains such as vaccine-icmr[.]net, as featured in historical
Proofpoint reporting.

From further analysis of TA413 activity, we also identified
evidence that the group is likely using the open-source proxy tool
Stowaway. This is based on the identification of an ELF sample
(SHA256: 86f45f0d6778fda90a56ea8986a9124d768715af
425784bbd1c371feeb2bfe68) configured to communicate with
the IP address 134.122.129[.]38, which was uploaded to public
malware repositories in close proximity to the time this IP hosted
the TA413 domain freetibet[.]in. Notably, Stowaway has also
been observed in use by other likely Chinese state-sponsored
groups, per recent reporting by Kaspersky.

TA413 also continues to largely use domains spoofing
organizations associated with Tibet such as non-government
organizations (like Tibetan National Congress and Tibetan Youth
Congress) and media organizations (such as Tibet Times). The
group has also registered domains spoofing wider organizations
such as the remote working employment site FlexJobs and Indian
news firm Rediff News.

Additionally, through historical scanning data we identified
an open directory present on a TA413-controlled server
172.105.35[.]111 in June 2022. While this was no longer
accessible at the time of discovery, one of the files present was
named fscan_amd64. This is likely indicative of the group’s use
of the open-source internal network scanning tool fscan, which
uses a file of the same name. This tool was also observed in use
by another suspected Chinese state-sponsored actor TAG-22
(Bronze University, Earth Lusca, Fishmonger, Red Dev 10) by
Trend Micro researchers.

Victimology
In all of these recent campaigns, we have observed
TA413 persistently targeting organizations associated with
the Tibetan community, including entities associated with
the Tibetan government-in-exile. While this appears to make
up a large proportion of the group’s activity, open-source
reporting also identified short-lived TA413 activity targeting
European diplomatic and legislative bodies, non-profit policy
research organizations, and global organizations dealing with
economic affairs during the early stages of COVID-19 in 2020.
Using Recorded Future Network Traffic Analysis (NTA), we also
identified infrastructure associated with multiple government
organizations in Nepal and the corporate network of an Indian
Internet Service Provider (ISP) regularly communicating with
TA413 C2 infrastructure during the first half of 2022.

Malware Analysis: TA413’s Custom LOWZERO
Backdoor
LOWZERO is a backdoor that, after profiling the infected
machine and sending the data to the command-and-control
server, will receive additional modules to run. We believe the
modules are only delivered and executed if the fingerprinted
machine is of interest to the actors, as we did not observe any
additional modules while executing within a sandbox environment.
The modules likely expand upon the basic backdoor functionality
residing in LOWZERO. LOWZERO is also capable of proxying
communication received via the network listener out through
another connection, defined based upon prior data received.
The following analysis was performed on a sample of
the malware with SHA256 hash 5217c2a1802b0b0fe5592f9

Layers to Execution
The LOWZERO execution chain contains multiple layers/
stages:
• Stage 1 — Decompresses an embedded DLL file (stage 2)
before XOR decrypting it and executing it
• Stage 2 — Launches rundll32.exe in a suspended state
and injects the Stage 3 DLL into it; then it calls the
DllEntryPoint and the exported function F exposed by the
Stage 3 DLL
• Stage 3 — Exported function F contains the backdoor
functionality

Figure 5: LOWZERO loading process (Source: Recorded Future)

Config BreakDown
LOWZERO’s configuration information is passed in as a buffer
to Stage 3’s exported function F. The configuration data is both
encrypted and compressed. The decompression algorithm is
applied after the not operator is applied to decrypt the buffer.
The decompression algorithm is likely LZF (Lempel-Ziv-Free).
This same decompression algorithm is also used to decompress
the Stage 2 dll and is used as part of the encryption / decryption
scheme for C2 communication.

THREAT ANALYSIS | CHINA

Outlook
Our research identified persistent targeting of the Tibetan
community in the first half of 2022 from the probable Chinese
state-sponsored threat activity group TA413. The group
continues to incorporate new capabilities while also relying on
tried-and-tested TTPs. In particular, the stark contrast between
some of the tooling employed by the group versus infrastructure
management practices is likely indicative of separate teams
involved in the development of malware and exploits versus
those conducting operations. While mainly focused on Tibetan
targeting, TA413 also has multiple historical infrastructure and
malware ties to the group known as Tropic Trooper (Keyboy,
Pirate Panda) that are indicative of some degree of operational
overlap. More widely, TA413’s adoption of both zero-day and
recently published vulnerabilities is indicative of wider trends
with Chinese cyber-espionage groups whereby exploits regularly
appear in use by multiple distinct Chinese activity groups prior
to their widespread public availability.

THREAT ANALYSIS | CHINA

Appendix C: Weak C2 Protocol Analysis
Since the C2 TLS connection doesn’t use public/private key encryption and because the AES key is derived from the TLS
handshake itself, we can decrypt the network traffic captured between the C2 and LOWZERO. We did so in an online submission of
LOWZERO found in AnyRun. To do this, we created a Python script that: takes the client random bytes, server random bytes, and
the encrypted data as arguments; performs the two rounds of AES decryption; and then parses the C2 communication structure
to get the command identifier and the command data. The command data is then custom base64-decoded, XOR-decoded, and
decompressed.
We decoded the below LOWZERO commands received from the AnyRun submission PCAP. We observed that
after the initialization packet, the C2 will respond with the command 2000, which decodes the command data to
225c218c74bd855c071d972d61a3f5278b0e1cb5. This value appears to be some type of identifier the client uses to check-in
with the C2, as LOWZERO sends this value back to C2 in response to both the 2000 and 2002 (Set Communication Time Delay)
commands. A Python script to decode LOWZERO C2 network traffic can be found on our GitHub repository here.
