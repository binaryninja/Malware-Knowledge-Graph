RAMP Ransomware’s Apparent Overture to Chinese Threat Actors
Flashpoint has observed an increase in recent weeks of Mandarin and Chinese-speaking
threat actors on RAMP as well as other illicit communities across the deep and dark web.

RAMP forum returns—but to what end?
Flashpoint has observed an increase in recent weeks of Mandarin and Chinese-speaking
threat actors on RAMP as well as other illicit communities across the deep and dark web.
There are indications that the Russian-language ransomware forum is warming to Englishand Mandarin-speaking threat actors. However, these clues, outlined below, may represent a
social engineering experiment aimed at manipulating the media, à la Groove.

RAMP is now in multiple languages

1/3

In October, RAMP administrators made changes to the forum’s interface that make it more
accessible to Chinese-speaking and English-speaking threat actors. Forum sections are now
in Russian, English, and Mandarin; the main administrator is addressing members in English
more often than before; and there is noticeably more English content and comments—and
even coming from some Russian-speaking actors.
Furthermore, the RAMP authorization form (for account verification) now includes a domain
for a Chinese forum among the others.
Previously, RAMP was a mainly Russian-speaking forum, although English-speaking
members were tolerated.
Founded this summer year in response to top-tier Russian-speaking forums banning ads by
ransomware gangs, and now in its third iteration, RAMP now appears under a new .onion
domain and requires former users to re-register.

Mandarin on illicit communities
In October, an XSS user replied to a thread with a Chinese-language ad looking for partners
in a ransomware operation. Furthermore, in the wake of BlackMatter’s shutdown, the
spokesperson of LockBit invited BlackMatter’s affiliates to move to China where the LockBit
spokesperson claimed to be residing.
In the screenshot below, XSS user “hoffman” greets two forum members who revealed
themselves as Chinese. The threat actor asks them if they could provide information about
ransomware and purchasing various kinds of system vulnerabilities. The language seems to
be machine-translated Chinese.

According to RAMP administrators, there are about 30 users of Chinese origin on the forum
thus far. However, apart from the Chinese-language forum headings, there is no notable
presence from Chinese-language threat actors. Admins promised to add content for Chinese
users soon.

Notably, RAMP administrators no longer require proof of membership on Exploit and XSS—
two other top-tier Russian-language illicit forums—to approve registration.

Flashpoint analysis
While it is possible that Russian-speaking ransomware operators may be seeking alliances
outside of Russia—cooperative cybersecurity talks with the U.S. are currently underway—it
remains unclear whether RAMP efforts to woo Chinese-speaking threat actors are in fact
legitimate or simply a smokescreen.
In late October 2021, the “Groove” ransomware gang called on other ransomware operators
to jointly attack US entities; once this generated media attention, the operator of Groove’s
public blog claimed that it was a media hack. It is certainly possible that RAMP’s overture to
Chinese-speaking threat actors is part of a similar strategy.
