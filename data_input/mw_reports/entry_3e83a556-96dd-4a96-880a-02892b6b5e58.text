We found a new modular ﬁleless botnet malware, which we named “Novter,” (also reported and known as
“Nodersok” and “Divergent”) that the KovCoreG campaign has been distributing since March. We’ve been
actively monitoring this threat since its emergence and early development, and saw it being frequently
updated. KovCoreG, active since 2011, is a long-running campaign known for using the Kovter botnet
malware, which was distributed mainly through malvertisements and exploit kits. Kovter has been involved
in click fraud operations since 2015, using fraudulent ads that have reportedly cost businesses more than
US$29 million. The botnet was taken down at the end of 2018 through concerted efforts by law enforcement
and cybersecurity experts, including Trend Micro.
The dismantlement hasn’t deterred the cybercriminals. Though the botnet is dead, we noticed that the
KovCoreG campaign didn’t stop their activities and instead developed another botnet. Working with
ProofPoint’s threat researcher Kafeine, we were able to uncover a new ﬁleless botnet malware — Novter —
being distributed by the operators of KovCoreG.
While the malvertising attacks were originally focused on U.S.-based users, they have since expanded to
several European countries starting this summer. Our telemetry also revealed that the malvertising attacks
were being distributed through a few of top 100 websites in the U.S., which were also abused by Kovter in
their previous activities. Our analysis of Novter, particularly its most notable modules, are detailed in this
technical brief.

KovCoreG’s attack chain
KovCoreG’s attacks are socially engineered malvertisments that lure unwitting users into downloading a
software package needed to update their supposedly out-of-date Adobe Flash application. However, it instead
drops a malicious HTML application (HTA) ﬁle named Player{timestamp}.hta. When the victim executes the
HTA ﬁle, it will load additional scripts from a remote server (communication is RC4-encrypted) and run a
PowerShell script that appears to take inspiration from the open-source Invoke-PSInject project.

The PowerShell script, in turn, will disable Windows Defender and Windows Update processes. It runs a
shellcode to bypass User Account Control (UAC) via the CMSTPLUA COM interface (related to connection
management). The PowerShell script is also embedded with Novter, which will be executed ﬁlelessly via the
PowerShell reﬂective injection technique.

Analysis of the Novter malware
Novter is a backdoor in the form of an executable ﬁle. Immediately after its execution, it performs the
following anti-debugging and anti-analysis checks:

Searching for blacklisted processes and modules by comparing the CRC32 algorithms of their names
with a list of hardcoded CRC32s
Checking if the number of cores is too small
Checking if the process is being debugged
Checking if the Sleep function is being manipulated
If it ﬁnds any of aforementioned information, it is then reported to the C&C server. Note that it uses different
sets of C&C servers for different purposes. One set, for instance, is solely used for anti-analysis reporting.
After the affected machine’s environment is double-checked and reported, the malware goes to sleep for a
long time.
The backdoor commands that Novter supports are:
killall — Terminate a process and delete a ﬁle (for all modules)
kill — Terminate a process and delete a ﬁle (for a speciﬁc module)
stop — Terminate the process without deleting its ﬁle (for a speciﬁc module)
resume — Start a process (for a speciﬁc module)
modules — Download and execute an additional module
update — Download a new version and install the update
update_interval — Set an interval between two consecutive update attempts
Novter communicates with its command-and-control (C&C) servers and downloads multiple JavaScript
modules for different purposes. We have identiﬁed three Novter modules, which include:
A module that shows a technical support scam page on the victim’s machine
A module that abuses WinDivert (Windows packet divert, a tool that enables network packets sent to
and from Windows network stacks to be captured, modiﬁed, or dropped) to block the communication
from processes like those from antivirus (AV) software
A module (which we named “Nodster”) that is written with NodeJS and io for proxying network
trafﬁc. We consider it a module responsible for building the proxy network needed to support the click
fraud operations.

Analysis of Novter’s module “Nodster”
During our analysis of Novter, we came across three notable modules downloaded by the malware. One of
them, which we named “Nodster,” is a network proxy module. The module installs NodeJS on the victim’s
machine and executes a NodeJS script “app.js” in the background. The script will connect to an embedded
C&C server address and receive the second C&C server address.
It will then establish a backconnection to the second C&C server with the socket.io protocol. The second
C&C server will return commands to instruct the module to make a TCP connection, send a TCP payload,
and return the response from the server back to them. This turns the system infected with Novter become a
proxy for the attacker to use.

Correlating Nodster’s trafﬁc
During the course of our research, we observed lots of encrypted trafﬁc proxied through the Nodster module,
but we managed to decrypt some of it, which showed scripts used for web advertising. This indicates that the
C&C server instructed the infected machine to open a website with an embedded JavaScript code related to
displaying advertisements.
We also noticed that the ad trafﬁc appeared to have been sent from Android devices, since the HTTP(S)
requests transferred through the proxy had HTTP User-Agent headers from Android devices. These requests
are appended with a “X-Requested-With” header with many Android app names. We inspected those apps on
the Google Play store because we initially thought that the trafﬁc could have been generated by these
applications. However, we did not ﬁnd any suspicious code in these applications that would have generated
this trafﬁc. We didn’t ﬁnd any similar code shared between these Android applications either.

Figure 5. The HTTPS request header spoofed to be from an Android device
With this ﬁnding, we inferred that the ad trafﬁc was not coming from the mobile devices, but was instead
being generated by the attacker. The attacker disguised the trafﬁc to appear as if it was being sent from
Android devices and mobile applications and proxied them through the Novter/Nodster botnet. After all,
KovCoreG’s operations involved click fraud.

Defending against Novter
Advertisements are an innocuous online staple, but KovCoreG’s campaign demonstrates how they can be
intrusive, not to mention how Novter can expose the user’s system to other and actual threats. Given how
KovCoreG engages in click fraud, it can signiﬁcantly affect businesses. A single mobile ad fraud incident in
2018, for instance, cost Google and its partners around US$10 million in losses.
Novter also exempliﬁes fraudsters’ maturing techniques with its use of ﬁleless infection methods and
obfuscating its C&C connections and fraud-related trafﬁc. Users, for their part, should adopt best practices,
especially against socially engineered threats like malvertisements.
