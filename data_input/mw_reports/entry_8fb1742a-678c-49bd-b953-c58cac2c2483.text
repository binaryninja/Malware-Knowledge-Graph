Secureworks incident responders investigated a long-running intrusion that involved
compromises of SharePoint and Exchange servers and multiple web shells with links to
Iranian threat groups. Tuesday, July 20, 2021 By: Counter Threat Unit Research Team

1/12

In March and November 2020, third-party researchers reported on a campaign where threat
actors targeted organizations using CVE-2020-0688, a remote code execution vulnerability in
Microsoft Exchange Server. Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers
observed a continuation of this activity through to at least April 2021, and potentially ongoing
as of June 2021.

Discovering historic and current intrusion activity
During a threat hunting engagement in April 2021, Secureworks incident responders
identified web shells on multiple hosts in a customer’s environment, as well as other
evidence of post-exploitation activity. Subsequent analysis revealed a previous compromise
of SharePoint servers within the environment, as well as ongoing activity initially facilitated by
the compromise of on-premises Exchange servers. CTU™ analysis indicates that the two
sets of activity were unrelated and were conducted by different threat groups.

Historic compromise of SharePoint servers
In April 2019, a threat actor compromised several SharePoint servers in the customer's
environment by exploiting SharePoint remote code execution vulnerability CVE-2019-0604.
This compromise led to the creation of multiple web shells, including simple China Chopper
web shells (see Figure 1). Some of these web shells used the same filename as their hardcoded parameter (e.g., t.aspx).

CTU researchers previously linked the IP addresses and filenames used by the attackers to
widespread and opportunistic exploitation of CVE-2019-0604 in the April 2019 timeframe.
Third-party reporting linked some of the exploitation activity to the China-based BRONZE
UNION threat group (also known as Emissary Panda and APT27).
From June 2019 to June 2020, several C# web shells were installed on the same SharePoint
servers, written to the same directories as the China Chopper web shells. These web shells
take a key and a Base64-encoded buffer as input, use the key to decrypt the buffer to a byte
array, and load the array into memory via the System.Reflection.Assembly.Load method (see
Figure 2).

Other than being installed on the same compromised servers in the same locations, there is
no evidence to link this second set of web shells to the earlier China Chopper deployment.
By June 2019, the SharePoint vulnerability was widely known and multiple threat actors were
opportunistically exploiting it.

Ongoing campaign leveraging compromised Exchange Servers
Secureworks incident responders discovered that a basic file upload and command
execution web shell (owafont.aspx) was installed on an Exchange Server within the
customer's environment in late 2020. Initial access was likely achieved by exploiting CVE2020-0688. An attacker possessing valid user credentials can leverage this vulnerability to
execute arbitrary code. There is no evidence linking this activity to the 2019 SharePoint
compromise.
In early 2021, the same web shell was installed on other Exchange Servers within the
environment, likely using the same compromised administrator account. CTU researchers
identified a hostname for the threat actor's system (WIN-P6LP3KP4SQ6) in associated
Windows authentication events.

Approximately three months later, the attacker re-entered the environment using the same
hostname and the same compromised credentials to upload the TransportClient.dll web
shell. According to third-party analysis of this small C# web shell, it can execute commands
directly via cmd.exe or can send commands to the 'splsvc' named pipe. CTU researchers
observed that the attacker used a Base64-encoded PowerShell script to create the named
pipe (see Figure 3). This script potentially leveraged open-source code available from
GitHub.

CTU researchers identified a second variant of this script in the environment as well. In
addition to creating the named pipe, this variant creates a scheduled task called 'Google
Updater' (see Figure 4).

TransportClient.dll contains a PDB string (see Figure 5) that is also present in other identified
copies of the web shell. Elements in the string led CTU researchers to name this web shell
'SheepTransportShell'.

Figure 6 shows how the threat actor used the Appcmd.exe Internet Information Services (IIS)
utility to install SheepTransportShell. Multiple threat groups have used this technique,
including the Iranian COBALT LYCEUM threat group. Appcmd.exe could reportedly be used
to install the RGDoor IIS backdoor used by COBALT LYCEUM and COBALT GYPSY.
COBALT GYPSY and COBALT LYCEUM are subsets of the threat group described in open
source as APT34.

By investigating the combination of the hostname and the compromised accounts,
Secureworks incident responders identified additional intrusion activity in the customer's
environment. The attacker accessed a critical business server to deploy a web shell named
service.aspx. Service.aspx provides file upload, file download, and remote code execution
capabilities.
A second web shell with a slightly different filename (services.aspx) was uploaded to the
same server. Services.aspx appears to borrow code (see Figure 7) from the HighShell and
HyperShell web shells. These tools are associated with COBALT GYPSY but were posted
online in 2019 as part of the 'Lab Dookhtegan' leaks. As a result, they cannot be considered
exclusive to this threat group.

shell (bottom). (Source: Secureworks, GitHub)
The threat actor uploaded an s.aspx web shell to the same SharePoint servers that were
previously exploited in April 2019. This web shell has the same functionality as
services.aspx. The attacker then used PowerShell to modify the file metadata timestamps
(see Figure 8) to match those of srchrss.aspx, a legitimate file that builds an RSS feed based
on a search query. This modification was likely an effort to make the web shell blend in with
legitimate files. The s.aspx and services.aspx web shells are nearly identical, suggesting that
the same threat actor deployed both of them.

As part of the same intrusion activity, the threat actor dumped and exfiltrated credentials from
the organization's certificate authority server and from a domain controller. After a dropped
Mimikatz credential harvester binary (6.exe) was blocked by antivirus software, the threat
actor used native system tools. Ntdsutil.exe was used on the domain controller to dump the
credentials, which were then exfiltrated as a compressed file (a.zip) via one of the
compromised Exchange Servers.
Approximately one week later, a threat actor exploited a different administrator account to
view the C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\
subdirectories for ASPX files. Endpoint telemetry captured the attacker viewing the file
contents of the t.aspx China Chopper web shell (see Figure 9). It is likely that these actions
were performed by the same threat actor, although CTU researchers do not have evidence
to confirm this.

Attribution
CTU analysis suggests that an Iranian threat group, possibly COBALT GYPSY, was
responsible for the activity that started with the compromise of the Exchange Servers:
The long-running nature of the intrusion ─ The emphasis on persistence, the multiple
entry points, and the lengthy duration are typical of threat actors focused on espionage
rather than on financial gain.
The nature of affected organizations ─ The targeting and activity observed by CTU
researchers and described in third-party reporting is consistent with Iranian threat
groups' objectives.

7/12

The data ingress and egress technique ─ The threat actors used a subdomain of
pipedream, which is a service that provides webhook-like functionality. Iranian groups
have previously used similar services. These services allow the attacker to return
custom responses to command and control (C2) traffic, and traffic to these services
may appear legitimate to network defenders.
Use of web shells ─ The web shells are generic but are stylistically similar to those
previously associated with Iranian threat groups such as COBALT GYPSY. The use of
a malicious IIS module for the SheepTransportShell web shell is reminiscent of the
RGDoor backdoor, which is linked to COBALT GYPSY and COBALT LYCEUM.

Conclusion
Iranian threat groups continue to pose a significant threat. These and other threat actors
actively search for vulnerabilities that they can weaponize. After gaining access to a
compromised network, they attempt to establish multiple entry points and steal legitimate
user credentials to maintain access even after vulnerabilities have been patched. In addition
to patching, organizations must gain visibility on their endpoints, particularly internet-facing
and business-critical servers. This visibility lets network defenders detect and rapidly
respond to network intrusions.
