Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to
Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation

Scope Note
This paper presents a comprehensive open source assessment of China’s capability
to conduct computer network operations (CNO) both during peacetime and periods of
conflict. The result will hopefully serve as useful reference to policymakers, China
specialists, and information operations professionals. The research for this project
encompassed five broad categories to show how the People’s Republic of China
(PRC) is pursuing computer network operations (CNO) and the extent to which it is
being implemented by examining:
a) The PLA‘s strategy for computer network operations at the campaign and
strategic level to understand how China is integrating this capability into overall
planning efforts and operationalizing it among its field units;
b) Who are the principal institutional and individual “actors” in Chinese CNO and
what linkages may exist between the civilian and military operators;
c) Possible targets of Chinese CNO against the US during a conflict to
understand how the PLA might attempt to seize information control over the
US or similar technologically advanced military during a conflict;
d) The characteristics of ongoing network exploitation activities targeting the US
Government and private sector that are frequently attributed to China;
e) A timeline of alleged Chinese intrusions into US government and industry
networks to provide broader context for these activities.

The basis for this work was a close review of authoritative open source PLA writings,
interviews with Western PLA and information warfare analysts, reviews of Western
scholarship on these subjects, and forensic analysis of intrusions into US networks
assessed to have Chinese origins. The research draws heavily from journals and
articles published by the Chinese National Defense University and the Academy of
Military Sciences, the military’s highest authority for issues of doctrine, strategy, and
force modernization. Many of these publications offer substantive insights into
current thinking on strategy and doctrinal issues related to information warfare and
CNO. Additional insights into the role of information warfare in broader campaign
doctrine and strategy came from The Science of Military Strategy, The Science of
Campaigns, two of the most authoritative sources on the subject available in the open
press. The military’s official newspaper, The PLA Daily, and a range of Chinese
military journals, official media, provincial and local media as well as non-PRC
regional media, all provided data on information warfare (IW) training events.

Technical assessments of operational tradecraft observed in intrusions attributed to
China are the result of extensive forensic analysis and discussions with information
security professionals who follow these issues closely. A review of Chinese technical
journal articles on computer network attack and exploitation techniques also aided
this study. This research was obtained from online Chinese databases accessible in
the US.
A regular review of the contents and discussions posted on Chinese hacker Websites
contributed to the analysis of these groups’ activities and capabilities. The focus of
this effort was to identify possible interactions between members of these groups and
the government. Conversations with Western information security analysts who
closely follow these groups and actors contributed immensely to focusing the
research and greatly aided our understanding of China’s hacker communities.
This study was not scoped to include research in China, consequently, the authors
focused on the materials and insights presently available outside of China. Additional
in-country research on this subject is an avenue of future effort that can—and
should—supplement the work presented here.

Executive Summary
The government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is a decade into a
sweeping military modernization program that has fundamentally transformed its
ability to fight high tech wars. The Chinese military, using increasingly networked
forces capable of communicating across service arms and among all echelons of
command, is pushing beyond its traditional missions focused on Taiwan and toward a
more regional defense posture. This modernization effort, known as
informationization, is guided by the doctrine of fighting “Local War Under
Informationized Conditions,” which refers to the PLA’s ongoing effort to develop a
fully networked architecture capable of coordinating military operations on land, in air,
at sea, in space and across the electromagnetic spectrum.
This doctrinal focus is providing the impetus for the development of an advanced IW
capability, the stated goal of which is to establish control of an adversary’s
information flow and maintain dominance in the battlespace. Increasingly, Chinese
military strategists have come to view information dominance as the precursor for
overall success in a conflict. The growing importance of IW to China’s People’s
Liberation Army (PLA) is also driving it to develop more comprehensive computer
network exploitation (CNE) techniques to support strategic intelligence collection
objectives and to lay the foundation for success in potential future conflicts.
One of the chief strategies driving the process of informatization in the PLA is the
coordinated use of CNO, electronic warfare (EW), and kinetic strikes designed to
strike an enemy’s networked information systems, creating “blind spots” that various
PLA forces could exploit at predetermined times or as the tactical situation warranted.
Attacks on vital targets such as an adversary’s intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance (ISR) systems will be largely the responsibility of EW and
counterspace forces with an array of increasingly sophisticated jamming systems and
anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons. Attacks on an adversary’s data and networks will
likely be the responsibility of dedicated computer network attack and exploitation
units.
The Chinese have adopted a formal IW strategy called “Integrated Network Electronic
Warfare” (INEW) that consolidates the offensive mission for both computer network
attack (CNA) and EW under PLA General Staff Department’s (GSD) 4th Department
(Electronic Countermeasures)1 while the computer network defense (CND) and
1

The General Staff Department is the highest organizational authority in the PLA responsible for the
daily administrative duties of the military. It is comprised of seven functional departments: operations,
intelligence, signals intelligence, electronic countermeasures, communications, mobilization, foreign
relations, and management.

6

Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to

intelligence gathering responsibilities likely belong to the GSD 3rd Department
(Signals Intelligence), and possibly a variety of the PLA’s specialized IW militia units.
This strategy, which relies on a simultaneous application of electronic warfare and
computer network operations against an adversary’s command, control,
communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR)
networks and other essential information systems, appears to be the foundation for
Chinese offensive IW. Analysis of this strategy suggests that CNO tools will be
widely employed in the earliest phases of a conflict, and possibly preemptively
against an enemy’s information systems and C4ISR systems.
The PLA is training and equipping its force to use a variety of IW tools for intelligence
gathering and to establish information dominance over its adversaries during a
conflict. PLA campaign doctrine identifies the early establishment of information
dominance over an enemy as one of the highest operational priorities in a conflict;
INEW appears designed to support this objective.
The PLA is reaching out across a wide swath of Chinese civilian sector to meet the
intensive personnel requirements necessary to support its burgeoning IW capabilities,
incorporating people with specialized skills from commercial industry, academia, and
possibly select elements of China’s hacker community. Little evidence exists in open
sources to establish firm ties between the PLA and China’s hacker community,
however, research did uncover limited cases of apparent collaboration between more
elite individual hackers and the PRC’s civilian security services. The caveat to this is
that amplifying details are extremely limited and these relationships are difficult to
corroborate.
China is likely using its maturing computer network exploitation capability to support
intelligence collection against the US Government and industry by conducting a long
term, sophisticated, computer network exploitation campaign. The problem is
characterized by disciplined, standardized operations, sophisticated techniques,
access to high-end software development resources, a deep knowledge of the
targeted networks, and an ability to sustain activities inside targeted networks,
sometimes over a period of months.
Analysis of these intrusions is yielding increasing evidence that the intruders are
turning to Chinese “black hat” programmers (i.e. individuals who support illegal
hacking activities) for customized tools that exploit vulnerabilities in software that
vendors have not yet discovered. This type of attack is known as a “zero day exploit”
(or “0-day”) as the defenders haven't yet started counting the days since the release
of vulnerability information. Although these relationships do not prove any
government affiliation, it suggests that the individuals participating in ongoing
penetrations of US networks have Chinese language skills and have well established

7

US-China Economic and Security Review Commission
Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to

ties with the Chinese underground hacker community. Alternately, it may imply that
the individuals targeting US networks have access to a well resourced infrastructure
that is able to broker these relationships with the Chinese blackhat hacker community
and provide tool development support often while an operation is underway.
The depth of resources necessary to sustain the scope of computer network
exploitation targeting the US and many countries around the world coupled with the
extremely focused targeting of defense engineering data, US military operational
information, and China-related policy information is beyond the capabilities or profile
of virtually all organized cybercriminal enterprises and is difficult at best without some
type of state-sponsorship.
The type of information often targeted for exfiltration has no inherent monetary value
to cybercriminals like credit card numbers or bank account information. If the stolen
information is being brokered to interested countries by a third party, the activity can
still technically be considered “state-sponsored,” regardless of the affiliation of the
actual operators at the keyboard.
The US information targeted to date could potentially benefit a nation-state defense
industry, space program, selected civilian high technology industries, foreign
policymakers interested in US leadership thinking on key China issues, and foreign
military planners building an intelligence picture of US defense networks, logistics,
and related military capabilities that could be exploited during a crisis. The breadth of
targets and range of potential “customers” of this data suggests the existence of a
collection management infrastructure or other oversight to effectively control the
range of activities underway, sometimes nearly simultaneously.
In a conflict with the US, China will likely use its CNO capabilities to attack select
nodes on the military’s Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET)
and unclassified DoD and civilian contractor logistics networks in the continental US
(CONUS) and allied countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The stated goal in targeting
these systems is to delay US deployments and impact combat effectiveness of troops
already in theater.
No authoritative PLA open source document identifies the specific criteria for
employing computer network attack against an adversary or what types of CNO
actions PRC leaders believe constitutes an act of war.
Ultimately, the only distinction between computer network exploitation and attack is
the intent of the operator at the keyboard: The skill sets needed to penetrate a
network for intelligence gathering purposes in peacetime are the same skills
necessary to penetrate that network for offensive action during wartime. The
difference is what the operator at that keyboard does with (or to) the information once

inside the targeted network. If Chinese operators are, indeed, responsible for even
some of the current exploitation efforts targeting US Government and commercial
networks, then they may have already demonstrated that they possess a mature and
operationally proficient CNO capability.

Chinese Computer Network Operations Strategy
The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is actively developing a capability
for computer network operations (CNO) and is creating the strategic guidance,
tools and trained personnel necessary to employ it in support of traditional
warfighting disciplines. Nonetheless, the PLA has not openly published a CNO
strategy with the formal vetting of the Central Military Commission (CMC), China's top
military decisionmaking body, or the Academy of Military Sciences (AMS), its leading
body for doctrine and strategy development . The PLA has however, developed a
strategy called “Integrated Network Electronic Warfare” that is guiding the
employment of CNO and related information warfare tools. The strategy is
characterized by the combined employment of network warfare tools and electronic
warfare weapons against an adversary’s information systems in the early phases of a
conflict.
Chinese information warfare strategy is closely aligned with the PLA’s doctrine for
fighting Local Wars Under Informationized Conditions, the current doctrine that seeks
to develop a fully networked architecture capable of coordinating military operations
on land, in air, at sea, in space and across the electromagnetic spectrum. China’s
military has shifted from a reliance on massed armies of the Maoist Era People’s War
doctrine and is becoming a fully mechanized force linked by advanced C4ISR
technologies.
Informationization is essentially a hybrid development process, continuing the trend
of mechanization and retaining much of the current force structure while overlaying
advanced information systems on it to create a fully networked command and control
(C2) infrastructure.2 The concept allows the PLA to network its existing force
structure without radically revising current acquisition strategies or order of battle.
•

PLA assessments of current and future conflicts note that campaigns will be
conducted in all domains simultaneously—ground, air, sea, and
electromagnetic—but it is the focus of the latter domain in particular that has
driven the PLA’s adoption of the Informationized Conditions doctrine.3

This doctrine is also influencing how the PLA approaches its military campaigns,
attempting to shift from the traditional combined arms operations to what the PLA
refers to as “integrated joint operations under informationized conditions.” The former
is characterized by large mechanized formations fighting in tandem but without a
shared common operating picture and the latter stresses the dominance of
information technology and its ability to shape ground, sea, air, and space into a
multi-dimensional battlefield. In the integrated joint operations framework, the PLA
uses information network technology to connect its services and warfighting
disciplines into an integrated operational whole, a concept that is also shaping the
PLA’s approach to information warfare.
Achieving information dominance is one of the key goals for the PLA at the
strategic and campaign level, according to The Science of Military Strategy and
The Science of Campaigns, two of the PLA’s most authoritative public
statements on its doctrine for military operations. 4 Seizing control of an
adversary’s information flow and establishing information dominance (zhi xinxi quan)
are essential requirements in the PLA’s campaign strategy and are considered so
fundamental that The Science of Military Strategy considers them a prerequisite for
seizing air and naval superiority.5
•

The Science of Military Strategy and The Science of Campaigns both identify
enemy C4ISR and logistics systems networks as the highest priority for IW
attacks, which may guide targeting decisions against the US or other
technologically advanced opponents during a conflict.

•

The Science of Campaigns states that IW must mark the start of a campaign
and, used properly, can enable overall operational success.6

The seeming urgency in making the transition from a mechanized to an
informationized force is driven by the perception that winning local wars against
adversaries with greater technological advantages, such as the United States, may
not be possible without a strong information warfare capability to first control enemy
access to its own information.7

•

PLA discussions of information dominance focus on attacking an adversary’s
C4ISR infrastructure to prevent or disrupt the acquisition, processing, or
transmission of information in support of decisionmaking or combat operations.
The goal is to combine these paralyzing strikes on the command and control
architecture with possible hard kill options using missiles, air strikes, or Special
Forces against installations or hardware.

•

Degrading these networks potentially prevents the enemy from collecting,
processing, and disseminating information or accessing information necessary
to sustain combat operations, allowing PLA forces to achieve operational
objectives such as landing troops on Taiwan in a cross-strait scenario before
the US can effectively intervene.

The PLA has also come to recognize the importance of controlling space-based
information assets as a means of achieving true information dominance, calling it the
“new strategic high ground,” and many of its advocates consider space warfare to be
a subset of information warfare.8 The PLA is seeking to develop the capability to use
space for military operations while denying this same capability to an adversary. PLA
authors acknowledge that space dominance is also essential for operating joint
campaigns and for maintaining the initiative on the battlefield. Conversely, they view
the denial of an adversary’s space systems as an essential component of information
warfare and a prerequisite for victory. 9
The PLA maintains a strong R&D focus on counterspace weapons and though many
of the capabilities currently under development exceed purely cyber or EW options,
they are nonetheless, still considered “information warfare” weapons.10 Among the
most high profile of China’s ASAT capabilities are kinetic weapons, which rely on
projectiles or warheads fired at high speed to impact a satellite directly. The
successful January 2007 test of this capability against a defunct Chinese weather
satellite demonstrated that the PLA has moved past theoretical discussions of this
option and toward an operational capability. Directed energy weapons, such as
lasers, high power microwave systems and nuclear generated electromagnetic pulse

attacks (EMP), are under development. The perceived benefits are the immediacy,
and in the case of EMP, the broad scope of the effect.11
While the use of any of these weapons against US satellites could quickly escalate a
crisis, detonating a nuclear device to create an EMP effect runs an especially high
risk of crossing US “red lines” for the definition of a nuclear attack, even if the attack
is carried out in the upper reaches of the atmosphere. Additionally, EMP is nondiscriminatory in its targeting and though the PLA is training and preparing its force to
operate under “complex electromagnetic conditions,” many of its own space-based
and possibly terrestrial communications systems may be damaged by either high
altitude or more localized EMP attacks. At a minimum, EMP and other types of ASAT
attacks expose the PLA to retaliatory strikes against China’s own burgeoning satellite
constellation, potentially crippling its nascent space-based C4ISR architecture.
A full discussion of Chinese capabilities for space information warfare is beyond the
scope of the present study’s focus on computer network operations, however, the
subject is becoming central to the PLA’s discussions of information warfare and in its
analysis of informationization in the Chinese force structure.

Integrated Network Electronic Warfare
The conceptual framework currently guiding PLA IW strategy is called “Integrated
Network Electronic Warfare” (wangdian yitizhan) a combined application of computer
network operations and electronic warfare used in a coordinated or simultaneous
attack on enemy C4ISR networks and other key information systems. The objective
is to deny an enemy access to information essential for continued combat operations.
The adoption of this strategy suggests that the PLA is developing specific
roles for CNO during wartime and possibly peacetime as well.
•

PLA campaign strategy also reflects an intention to integrate CNO and EW
into the overall operational plan, striking enemy information sensors and
networks first to seize information dominance, likely before other forces
engage in combat.

•

The INEW strategy relies on EW to jam, deceive, and suppress the enemy’s
information acquisition, processing, and dissemination capabilities; CNA is

intended to sabotage information processing to “attack the enemy’s
perceptions.”12
Consistent references to various elements of INEW by PLA authors in authoritative
publications strongly suggest that the PLA has adopted it as its dominant IW strategy,
despite the apparent lack of any publicly available materials indicating that the
principle has received official vetting from senior PLA leaders.
•

The originator of the INEW strategy, Major General Dai Qingmin, a prolific and
outspoken supporter of modernizing the PLA’s IW capabilities, first described
the combined use of network and electronic warfare to seize control of the
electromagnetic spectrum as early as 1999 in articles and a book entitled An
Introduction to Information Warfare, written while on faculty at the PLA’s
Electronic Engineering Academy.13

•

An uncorroborated Taiwan media source claims that Major General Dai
drafted a 2002 internal PLA report stating that the PLA adopted an IW strategy
using integrated network and electronic warfare as its core.14

•

A July 2008 analysis of PLA information security architecture requirements by
a researcher from the Second Artillery College of Engineering in Xian noted
that “electronic warfare and computer network warfare are the two primary
modes of attack in information warfare….By using a combination of electronic
warfare and computer network warfare, i.e., "integrated network and electronic
warfare," enemy information systems can be totally destroyed or paralyzed.”15

•

A 2009 source offered what may be the most succinct illustration of how INEW
might be employed on the battlefield, stating that INEW includes “using
techniques such as electronic jamming, electronic deception and suppression
to disrupt information acquisition and information transfer, launching a virus
attack or hacking to sabotage information processing and information
utilization, and using anti-radiation and other weapons based on new
mechanisms to destroy enemy information platforms and information
facilities.”16

In 2002, Dai published An Introduction to Integrated Network Electronic Warfare,
formally codifying the concepts behind what would become the guiding strategy for
the use of CNO during wartime.17 He argued in a seminal article that same year that
the growing importance of integrated networks, sensors, and command structures
makes the destruction and protection of C4ISR systems a focal point for Chinese
IW.18
•

Both works were published with a strong endorsement from Chief of the
General Staff, Gen Fu Quanyou, who lauded the groundbreaking nature of the
ideas in both books; his endorsement suggests that Dai may have had
powerful allies supporting this approach to IW who perhaps enabled his
eventual promotion to head the General Staff Department’s 4th Department,
which is responsible for electronic countermeasures and it seems, the PLA’s
offensive CNA mission, as well.

•

Dai’s promotion in 2000 to lead the GSD 4th Department likely consolidated
both the institutional authority for the PLA’s IW mission in this organization and
INEW as the PLA’s official strategy for information warfare.19

Proponents of the INEW strategy specify that the goal is to attack only the key
nodes through which enemy command and control data and logistics
information passes and which are most likely to support the campaign’s
strategic objectives, suggesting that this strategy has influenced PLA planners
toward a more qualitative and possibly effects-based approach to IW targeting.
Attacks on an adversary’s information systems are not meant to suppress all
networks, transmissions, and sensors or to affect their physical destruction. The
approach outlined by Dai and others suggests that the INEW strategy is intended to
target only those nodes which the PLA’s IW planners assess will most deeply affect
enemy decisionmaking, operations, and morale.
•

The PLA’s Science of Campaigns notes that one role for IW is to create
windows of opportunity for other forces to operate without detection or with a
lowered risk of counterattack by exploiting the enemy’s periods of “blindness,”
“deafness” or “paralysis” created by information attacks.

•

Dai and others stress that the opportunities created by the application of the
INEW strategy should be quickly exploited with missile assaults or other
firepower attacks in a combination of “hard and soft attacks” that should
dominate in the early stages of a campaign.20

•

A December 2008 article in the AMS journal, China Military Science, asserts
that the PLA must disrupt or damage an enemy’s decisionmaking capacity
through a combined application of network warfare and other elements of IW
to jam and control the movement of an enemy’s information to achieve
information superiority.21

Integrated Network Electronic Warfare in PLA Training
PLA field exercises featuring components of INEW provide additional insights
into how planners are considering integrating this strategy across different
units and disciplines in support of a campaign’s objectives. IW training featuring
combined CNA/CND/EW is increasingly common for all branches of the PLA and at
all echelons from Military Region command down to the battalion or company and is
considered a core capability for the PLA to achieve a fully informationized status by
2009, as directed by PRC President and CMC Chairman Hu Jintao.
•

President Hu Jintao, during a speech at the June 2006 All-Army Military
Training Conference, ordered the PLA to focus on training that features
“complex electromagnetic environments,” the PLA’s term for operating in
conditions with multiple layers of electronic warfare and network attack,
according to an authoritative article in Jiefangjun Bao.22

•

During a June 2004 opposed force exercise among units in the Beijing Military
Region, a notional enemy “Blue Force” (which are adversary units in the PLA)
used CNA to penetrate and seize control of the Red Force command network
within minutes of the start of the exercise, consistent with the INEW strategy’s
emphasis on attacking enemy C2 information systems at the start of combat.

for the conventional and nuclear missile forces, conducted training that
featured INEW elements and relied upon a networked C2 infrastructure to

The PLA’s 2007 revised Outline for Military Training and Evaluation (OMTE)
training guidance directed all services to make training under complex
electromagnetic environments (CEME) the core of its campaign and tactical
training, according to the director of the General Staff Department's Military
Training and Arms Department.26 The focus on developing capabilities to fight
in informationized conditions reflects much of the core of the INEW strategy
and continues to shape current and future training, suggesting that despite
Dai Qingmin’s retirement from the PLA, this strategy continues to serve as
the core of Chinese IW.

The PLA has established a network of at least 12 informationized training
facilities that allow field units to rotate through for exercises in
environments featuring realistic multi-arms training in which jamming and
interference degrade PLA communications. The flagship facility at Zhurihe

The PLA’s large multi-military region exercise for battalion level units,
named Kuayue 2009 (Stride 2009) featured the first-ever simultaneous
deployment of units from four military regions and PLA Air Force (PLAAF)
units. The exercise focused on implementing the 2007 Training Outline for
informationized training and included multiple mission scenarios—
amphibious landing, air assault, close air support—under complex
electromagnetic environments.29

The emphasis of the 2007 training directive on operating in complex electromagnetic
environment and under informationized conditions may drive an expansion of
personnel training in IW specialties—including offensive network warfare skills—to
meet the demand among field units for skilled personnel. The PLA maintains a
network of universities and research institutes that support information warfare
related education either in specialized courses or more advanced degree granting
programs. The curriculum and research interests of affiliated faculty reflect the PLA’s
an emphasis on computer network operations.

Deterrence and Computer Network Operations
The Chinese government has not definitively stated what types of CNA actions
it considers to be an act of war which may reflect nothing more than a desire to
hold this information close to preserve strategic flexibility in a crisis. With the
exception of the Taiwan independence issue, the PRC leadership generally avoids
defining specific “red lines” for the use force; this is likely true for its CNA capabilities.
•

Effective deterrence requires capable and credible force with clear
determination to employ it if necessary and a means of communicating this
intent with the potential adversary, according to the Science of Military
Strategy.33

•

The Science of Military Strategy also stresses that deterrent measures can
include fighting a small war to avoid a much larger conflict. Tools like CNA and
EW, which are perceived to be “bloodless” by many PLA IW operators, may
become first choice weapons for a limited strike against adversary targets to
deter further escalation of a crisis. 34 This concept may also have implications
for PRC leadership willingness to use IW weapons preemptively if they believe
that information-based attacks don’t cross an adversary’s “red lines”.

The PLA may also use IW to target enemy decisionmaking by attacking information
systems with deceptive information to shape perceptions or beliefs. The Science of
Military Strategy highlights this as a key contribution that IW can make in support of
the overall campaign. Data manipulation or destruction may be perceived as a
valuable tool to aid broader strategic psychological or deception operations or to
support perception management objectives as part of a deterrence message.

both an enemy’s information systems and “cognition and belief system.” The
primary techniques for attacking information systems, he argues, are network
and electronic attack and the primary techniques for attacking people's
cognition and belief system are information deception and psychological
attack, which will also be implemented by CNO units.35
•

AMS guidance on the formation of IW militia units directed that they include
psychological operations elements to support perception management and
deception operations against an enemy.

Some PLA advocates of CNO perceive it as a strategic deterrent comparable to
nuclear weapons but possessing greater precision, leaving far fewer
casualties, and possessing longer range than any weapon in the PLA’s arsenal.
China’s development of a credible computer network attack capability is one
component of a larger effort to expand and strengthen its repertoire of strategic
deterrence options that includes new nuclear capable missiles, anti-satellite
weapons, and laser weapons.

Chinese researchers are working on a variety of radio frequency weapons with
the potential to target satellites and other components of the US C4ISR
architecture, according to US Department of Defense analysis.40

PLA Information Warfare Planning
An effective offensive IW capability requires the ability to assess accurately the likely
impact on the adversary of a CNA strike on a given node or asset. These
assessments, in turn, depend upon detailed intelligence on the adversary’s network,
the C2 relationships, and the various dependencies attached to specific nodes on the
network.
•

The Science of Military Strategy directs planners to “grasp the operational
center of gravity and choose the targets and sequence for strike…arrange the
enemy’s comprehensive weaknesses on the selective basis for a list of the
operational targets, according to the degree of their influences upon the whole
operational system and procedure.”41

•

Mission planners must also understand the explicit and implicit network
dependencies associated with a given node to avoid undesired collateral
damage or the defensive redundancies that may exist to enable the targeted
unit or organization to reroute its traffic and “fight through” the attack,
effectively nullifying the Chinese strike.

•

CNA planning also requires a nuanced understanding of the cultural or military
sensitivities surrounding how a given attack will be perceived by an adversary.
Failure to understand an enemy’s potential “red lines” can lead to unintentional
escalation of the conflict, forcing the PLA to alter its campaign objectives or
fight a completely new campaign for which it may be unprepared.

PLA IW planners and leaders have noted that CNO is blurring the separation that
military planners maintained between the hierarchy of “strategy,” “campaign,” and
“combat” (or “tactics” in Western usage) so that CNO or EW weapons employed by
tactical-sized units can strike strategic targets deep in the adversary’s own territory
beyond the range of most conventional weapons, possibly changing the course of the
conflict.42 This changing perspective on IW and especially CNO tools may impact the
senior leadership perspective on targeting, particularly if the use of these tools is

Chinese Computer Network Operations During Conflict
Like the use of missile or air power, CNO is one of several increasingly capable
warfighting components available to PLA commanders during a conflict, however, the
PLA rarely discusses CNO as a standalone capability to be employed in isolation
from other warfighting disciplines. Understanding how it may be used in support of a
larger campaign requires Western analysts and policymakers to consider China’s
overall campaign objectives to understand CNO in its proper context. The current
strategy for fighting a campaign in a high tech environment, reflected in the doctrinal
guidance to “strike the enemy’s nodes to destroy his network,”43 directs commanders
to attack the adversary’s C2 and logistics networks first and exploit the resulting
“blindness” with traditional firepower attacks on platforms and personnel. This
strategy suggests that the PLA may strike with CNO and EW weapons in the
opening phases of a conflict to degrade enemy information systems rather
than attempt a traditional force-on-force attack directly where the PLA is at a
disadvantage against more technologically advanced countries like the US.
•

Denying an adversary access to information systems critical for combat
operations is influenced by principles of traditional Chinese strategic thought,
but the strategy is also the result of extensive contemporary PLA analysis of
likely adversaries’ weak points and centers of gravity.

•

While Chinese military leaders are almost certainly influenced by their strategic
culture and traditions of stratagem, much of China’s contemporary military
history reflects a willingness to use force in situations where the PRC was
clearly the weaker entity. Scholarship on the subject suggests that PRC
political leaders often determined that conflict in the short term would be less
costly than at a later date when strategic conditions were even less favorable
to China. This logic often seems counterintuitive to the casual Western
observer but reflects a nuanced assessment of changing strategic conditions
and how best to align with them for a favorable outcome. PLA and PRC
leaders capture this idea often when discussing the use of strategies,
stratagem, or weapons that enable the weak to overcome the strong.44

43

Science of Military Strategy, p. 464.
There is a growing record of contemporary scholarship on strategic culture, deterrence, stratagem,
and China’s propensity to use force. While it is beyond the scope of the present study, a more
extensive discussion of the relationship of these topics to contemporary computer network operations
is essential, particularly one that moves the discussion beyond comparisons of China’s military
classics and toward a broader context for understanding the complexity of modern Chinese
perceptions of IW and the value of CNO. For a small representative sample of some of the excellent
research done on China’s calculus for the use of force see: Allen S. Whiting, China Crosses the Yalu:

•

The PLA’s employment of CNO reflects an intention to use it (with EW
weapons) as one element of an integrated—and increasingly joint—campaign
capability. Campaign doctrine calls for using CNO as a precursor to achieve
information dominance, providing “openings” or opportunities for air, naval,
and ground forces to act.

CNO in any military crisis between China and the US will likely be used to mount
persistent attacks against the Department of Defense’s NIPRNET nodes that support
logistics, and command and control functions. Attacks such as these are intended to
degrade US information and support systems sufficiently for the PLA to achieve its
campaign objectives before the US and its Allies can respond with sufficient force to
defeat or degrade the PLA’s operation. In a Taiwan scenario, for example, PLA
planners likely consider the opening days as the critical window of opportunity to
achieve military objectives on the island. CNO and other IW weapons that delay a
US military response only increase the PLA’s possibility of success without requiring
direct combat with superior US forces.
•

Delaying or degrading US combat operations in this Taiwan scenario
sufficiently to allow the PLA to achieve lodgment on Taiwan or force the
capitulation of the political leadership on the island would present the US with
a fait accompli upon arrival in the combat operations area.

•

The majority of US military logistics information systems is transmitted or
accessed via the NIPRNET to facilitate communication or coordination
between the hundreds of civilian and military nodes in the military’s global
supply chain.

either in the US Pacific Command (USPACOM) area of operations (AOR) or CONUSbased locations supporting USPACOM operations will likely be subjected to Chinese
CNA and CNE operations during a conflict. The Chinese have identified the US
military’s long logistics “tail” and extended time for force build-up as strategic
vulnerabilities and centers of gravity to be exploited.
•

PLA assessments of US campaigns in Iraq (both Desert Storm and Operation
Iraqi Freedom), the Balkans, and Afghanistan identify logistics and the force
deployment times as weak points, the interruption of which will lead to supply
delays or shortages. These assessments in aggregate do not seem to
suggest that defeating the logistics systems will lead to a de facto US military
defeat (PLA professionals likely assume that the US will implement work
around and ad hoc solutions to these obstacles), but rather that these
disruptions will “buy time” for the PLA as noted above.

•

Logistics data of interest to PLA planners are likely areas such as specific unit
deployment schedules, resupply rates and scheduled movement of materiel,
unit readiness assessments, lift availability and scheduling, maritime
prepositioning plans, air tasking orders for aerial refueling operations, and the
logistics status of bases in the Western Pacific theater.

•

US Joint Publication 4-0: Joint Logistics notes that “the global dispersion of the
joint force and the rapidity with which threats arise have made real-time or
near real-time information critical to support military operations. Joint logistic
planning, execution, and control depend on continuous access to make
effective decisions. Protected access to networks is imperative to sustain joint
force readiness and allow rapid and precise response to meet JFC
requirements.”45

•

Potential Chinese familiarity with the network topology associated with US
Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) or related logistics units on
NIPRNET could aid CNE missions intended to access and exfiltrate data
related to the time-phased force and deployment data (TPFDD) of a specific
contingency or operations plan. A TPFDD is the logistics “blueprint” for the
sequence of movement of supplies and is based on a commander’s
expression of priorities for personnel and materiel to move into a combat
theater.

The Chinese may attempt to target potentially vulnerable networks associated
with strategic civilian ports, shipping terminals, or railheads that are

supporting the military’s movement of critical supplies and personnel.
Maintaining effective movement control during a major mobilization is inherently
complex. Disruptions of information systems at key nodes, particularly “downstream”
at shipping terminals or airports, while not catastrophic, could create major delays as
the traffic en route to the affected destination is forced to slow or halt, similar to the
cascading traffic delays that can result from a minor accident at rush hour.
•

US Joint Publication 4-0: Joint Logistics also points out that “inventory
management capitalizes on authoritative information (accurate, real-time, and
widely visible) and performance trends to inform decisions about attributes of
the materiel inventory throughout the supply chain. Maintaining optimal
stockage levels and accountability of materiel throughout the supply chain
enables the joint logistician to manage the flow of materiel between strategic
and tactical supply nodes to meet warfighter requirements.” 46

•

Many logistics databases on NIPRNET have Web-based interfaces to enable
ease of access, but may only require PLA operators to compromise one weak
password via keystroke logging or to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities on
the Website to gain user-like access.

•

Long term access to NIPRNET via CNE techniques—and to logistics
information supporting the TPFDD for various warplans in particular—also
allows the PLA to assemble a detailed current intelligence picture of the
intended US force deployment packages for specific contingencies.

The PLA’s basic CNE/CNA strategy against NIPRNET logistics databases is
likely a combination of attacks on selected network segments to limit both the
flow and possibly corrupt the content of unencrypted data. An attack on
logistics information systems may begin by exploiting previously compromised hosts
on the network held as a kind of war reserve in the event of a crisis.47
•

If PLA operators target a unit or network segment that does not authenticate
HTTP traffic (common Internet traffic) through a proxy server before leaving
the network, they will be able to operate much more freely on the network. An
attacker in this environment can connect out to a remote C2 node and
download additional tools or exfiltrate (and infiltrate) data without a
requirement for valid user credentials.

46

US Joint Publication 4-0: Joint Logistics, p. JP-40
The attack techniques may shift as changes to US INFOCON levels limits accessibility of some
applications or external connections and prioritization on network traffic affects the types of inbound
traffic permitted through firewalls.
47

26

US-China Economic and Security Review Commission
Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to
Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation

Reporting of attacks on US networks attributed to China suggests that these
operators possess the targeting competence to identify specific users in a unit
or organization based on job function or presumed access to information.
Access that exploits legitimate user credentials can allow the attacker to review file
directories and potentially target specific files for exfiltration or alteration, depending
on the mission requirements and the US INFOCON levels. Alternately, these
operators can use this access for passive monitoring of network traffic for intelligence
collection purposes. Instrumenting these machines in peacetime may enable
attackers to prepare a reserve of compromised machines that can be used during a
crisis.
•

Chinese CNO operators likely possess the technical sophistication to craft and
upload rootkit and covert remote access software, creating deep persistent
access to the compromised host and making detection extremely difficult.

•

An “upstream” attack on the networks of civilian contractors providing logistics
support to operational units also has potential for great impact and is
potentially easier against smaller companies that often lack the resources or
expertise for sophisticated network security and monitoring.

•

Many of the vulnerabilities outlined above can be greatly minimized if the
network uses a proxy server, implements firewall blocks of unproxied access,
blocks proxy access without valid user authentication, and prevents user
credentials from being exposed to the attackers.

Chinese CNO operators may also attempt to attack US perceptions of the
validity of data in these networks by uploading false records or corrupting
existing records, possibly for intentional detection. This discovery may generate
a manpower and resource intensive review of the targeted unit’s database records or
other files against a known good back up copy before the unit resumes normal
operations, creating potentially costly operational delays. If this type of attack is
staged against several large or critical supply nodes, the impact could be significant.
•

Uploading files or accessing existing records in NIPRNET-based logistics
databases would require PLA operators to compromise a computer on the
targeted LAN and be able to operate with the local users’ credentials, a
capability observed in past intrusions of US networks that are attributed to
China.

•

The discovery of this type of attack may have a greater impact on US forces
from a perception management or psychological operations perspective than
the more localized targeting to redirect supplies.

27

US-China Economic and Security Review Commission
Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to

•

Only a limited number of actual compromises may be required to have a
disproportionate impact on US operational tempo if information security
concerns require time consuming validation of logistics or other databases by
systems administrators and logistics personnel across the theater or in
CONUS.

Command and Control Data
Much of the operational traffic between command entities and subordinate units such
as unit location, status, situation reports, and deployment orders, is transmitted via
classified systems both in peacetime and wartime. Conducting CNO to penetrate
and compromise the encryption and defensive layers built into the architecture of
these systems is a resource intensive and time consuming process for Chinese IW
units or the civilian researchers likely supporting them. The Chinese doctrinal
orientation toward attacking an enemy’s information flow suggests that if a
classified network is attacked, it will likely be intended to impede encrypted
traffic flow if it moves across an unclassified backbone rather than attempting
to decrypt data or penetrate into the actual network.
•

Even if a sensitive encrypted network is not compromised, focused traffic
analysis of encrypted communications via computer network exploitation may
still yield useful information.

•

If PLA CNO operators are tasked with targeting the networks or databases of
specific US military units, then basic network reconnaissance conducted
during peacetime can support offensive operations during wartime.

•

Once these units or databases are identified, an attacker can use common
techniques or tools to affect a denial of service attack against any server or
router. The sophistication of this type of attack is within the assessed technical
capabilities of many individuals in China’s hacker community and likely of PLA
units with trained CNO operators.

•

Some CNE operations may be designed for purely reconnaissance purposes
to map out network topologies and understand the command and control
relationships of specific areas of US military or commercial networks rather
than exfiltrate data or emplace “sleeper” malicious software on targeted
machines.

PLA CNO commanders and operators likely recognize that a capability for peacetime
compromise is not a guarantee of wartime access. US INFOCON levels will increase
during a crisis, blocking access to some or all of an adversary’s pre-instrumented

28

machines. Ongoing probes and compromises designed to elicit changes in US
defensive posture may, however, provide some insights into how the network
environment will change during periods of heightened threat. Chinese operations,
therefore, could also include efforts designed to create intentional “noise” on the
network that elicits a reaction, allowing the attackers to gather intelligence on how the
US defensive posture will change under select circumstances. This is a cyber
parallel to US Cold War-era electronic warfare operations that were designed to
provoke a reaction from Soviet air defense networks to collect intelligence on their
responses to various types of threats.

Key Entities in Chinese Computer Network Operations
General Staff Department Fourth Department
The GSD 4th Department’s traditional offensive EW mission, Dai Qingmin’s
leadership of the department during the first half of this decade, and open
source reporting that references the Department’s role in implementing INEW,
all suggest that it has the primary authority for offensive IW in the PLA.
•

The 4th Department, also referred to as the Electronic Countermeasures
Department (ECM) Department, oversees both operational ECM units and
R&D institutes conducting research on a variety of offensive IW technologies.

•

The 4th Department’s oversight of IW dates to at least 1999 and probably
earlier. Recent scholarship notes that Dai Qingmin’s seminal work, On
Information Warfare, was vetted by the 4th Department prior to its publication in
1999 indicating that it had organizational oversight of this topic even at that
time.48

•

The GSD’s decision in 2000 to promote Dai Qingmin to head the 4th
Department—vetting his advocacy of the INEW strategy—likely further
consolidated the organizational authority for the IW—and the CNA mission
specifically—in this group. Dai’s promotion to this position suggests that the
GSD probably endorsed his vision of adopting INEW as the PLA’s IW strategy.

General Staff Department Third Department
The GSD Third Department’s longstanding signals intelligence (SIGINT) focus,
historical lack of an offensive role, and its large staff of trained linguists and
technicians makes it well suited for oversight of the CND and CNE missions in
the PLA. The 3rd Department maintains an extensive system of signals collection
stations throughout China with collection and processing stations co-located with
each of the PLA’s Military Region headquarters.49 It is tasked with the foreign signals
collection, exploitation, and analysis and also communications security for the PLA’s
voice and data networks. This latter responsibility may encompass network defense

though this figure cannot be independently confirmed. Regardless of the specific
figure, accessibility to a large staff of highly skilled linguists and technical analysts
would provide significant depth for a computer-based intelligence collection and
exploitation mission.

Technical Reconnaissance Bureaus
The PLA maintains at least six technical reconnaissance bureaus (TRB) located
in the Lanzhou, Jinan, Chengdu, Guangzhou, and Beijing military regions that
are responsible for SIGINT collection against tactical and strategic targets and
have apparent CNO duties, though few details are available on the exact role or
subordination of these units.52 The TRB’s probable subordination under the 3rd
Department suggests that their CNO responsibilities are likely focused on defense or
exploitation of foreign networks. While the TRB appear largely focused on traditional
SIGINT missions, oblique references to staff from these units conducting advanced
research on information security or possibly related topics suggests a possible CNO
or EW role that augments their SIGINT collection mission.53
•

TRB affiliated staff have also performed information assurance certification for
other PLA units, according to reporting from a Party affiliated newspaper.54

In 2002, the Third TRB, described as a “technical rapid reaction unit,” received
its fifth consecutive award for outstanding “research in information warfare
theories,” and the development of new technical means of operation,
according to a local Party affiliated media outlet. These dates and numbers
suggest that as early 1997, this TRB possibly began including IW in its
mission.55

PLA Information Warfare Militia Units
Since approximately 2002, the PLA has been creating IW militia units57
comprised of personnel from the commercial IT sector and academia, and
represents an operational nexus between PLA CNO operations and Chinese
civilian information security (infosec) professionals.58 The PLA has established
militia units directly within commercial firms throughout China to take advantage of
access to staff with advanced education, modern commercial-grade infrastructure,
sophisticated software design capabilities, and the greater likelihood of finding
“politically reliable” operators.59
•

A political commissar for the Guangzhou People’s Armed Police (PAP)
garrison advocated in 2003 the direct involvement of urban militia units in
information warfare, electronic warfare, and psychological warfare; He also
proposed that militia reform efforts should focus on making information warfare
one of the Guangzhou militia’s primary missions.60

•

A Tianjin-based militia garrison restructured subordinate units in 2004 to
increase capabilities for operations under informationized conditions, including
the creation of a dedicated information operations unit, according to the PLA
Daily.61

The Yongning unit is composed of an information warfare center detachment
(xinxi fendui zuozhan zhongxin), information gathering detachment (minbing
xinxi souji fendui), militia network warfare unit (minbing wangluo zhan fendui),
and a militia network protection unit (minbing wangluo fanghu fendui),
suggesting that this unit is responsible for the full range of CNO missions.65

In early 2003, AMS published an account of a probable proof of concept
initiative in the Guangzhou Military Region to establish IW militia units using
local telecommunications companies as a base from which to draw personnel,
financial support, and infrastructure access, suggesting that the PLA was
tapping its growing pool of civilian commercial IT expertise to aid military
information warfare requirements. The Guangzhou Garrison created four “Militia
Information Technology Battalions” in local firms comprised of CNO and offensive
and defensive EW units.66
•

The officers conducted a detailed census of Guangdong’s Dongshan District,
where the IT sector is concentrated, to identify people with specific
backgrounds, such as advanced degree holders, people who had studied
overseas, people credited with major scientific research achievements, and
computer networking experts, suggesting that this unit is tasked with more
sophisticated network operations that require both advanced technical
expertise and knowledge of foreign languages or cultures.67

•

The battalion included a headquarters unit, a computer network operations
company with attack and defense platoons, and an EW company with
electronic reconnaissance and deception platoons.

•

No unit level training materials existed prior this, according the officers
responsible for creating this unit, forcing them to draft a “Training Plan for
Militia Information Technology Elements,” with input from Guangzhou military
region headquarters units and an unspecified “electronic countermeasures
regiment,” a likely reference to a GSD 4th Department subordinate unit. This
lack of training materials suggests that it may have been one of the earliest
such units, possibly a proof of concept that the AMS was vetting.

Research responsibilities for this battalion included operational methods for
“launching hacker attacks, propagating viruses, jamming information channels, and
disrupting nodes of enemy networks” indicate that this particular unit was responsible
for offensive R&D in addition to operational CNE duties.68
Within three years of the Guangzhou unit’s creation, the AMS published a second
article on the concept that explicitly endorsed the formation of IW militia and directed
the PLA to make the creation of these units a priority.69 The model presented
followed closely what the Guangzhou Garrison created three years earlier,
suggesting the idea was now fully vetted and had a senior leadership mandate.
•

The AMS authors directed garrison level commands to establish these units
with personnel from local commercial IT industries and universities and train
them in simulated network warfare environments to develop their skills in all
aspects of IW and to create a mix of specialized units skilled in electronic
warfare, network warfare, and psychological warfare.70

•

Garrison commanders were also instructed to relax the militia’s standard age
and physical fitness requirements, likely to ensure that individuals with highly
valued technical skills are not eliminated unnecessarily.

Authoritative PLA writings on these units display a clear sensitivity to the
potential diplomatic impact resulting from the exposure of these units’
targeting of foreign networks or the potential proliferation of their tools outside
the units’ control. Possibly as a result of this sensitivity, the AMS authors
recommend unusually strict security precautions for militia units—particularly in
vetting and monitoring personnel—likely a reflection of their highly sensitive work.
•

The 2006 AMS article notes that many countries view network
reconnaissance, electronic jamming, and “network invasion” as serious issues
that may even be considered acts of war, one of the few such explicit
acknowledgements by the PLA.

•

Garrison commanders are urged to ensure that “individual behavior is
monitored and work results do not proliferate,” a possible reference to
guarding against leaks of classified information or software tools developed by
unit members.

Open source reporting on these units is limited to descriptions of their creation
and general organization. Research did not uncover materials outlining details
of their peacetime operations. These units may be focused on supporting
purely military operational requirements such as gathering intelligence on
foreign military networks to support contingency planning for CNA missions.

Regardless of the specifics of the mission, the PLA is clearly turning to its civilian IT
workforce as this resource base continues to grow. While traditional hackers offer
unique skill sets in some cases and may have a niche role for PLA or state
intelligence collection, the PLA clearly is looking to its increasingly mature base of
civilian IT expertise to round out its IW ranks.

The Chinese Hacker Community
China’s hackers, active in thousands of Web-based groups and individually,
represent a mature community of practitioners that has developed a rich knowledge
base similar to their counterparts in countries around the world. A review of these
Web communities reveals many layers of interest groups: malware tool developers,
legitimate security researchers, and novices and experts alike in search of training.
The tools or techniques that these groups post are often used by true black hat
practitioners.
China’s hacker community gained early notoriety for member willingness to engage in
large-scale politically motivated denial of service attacks, data destruction, and Web
defacements of foreign networks, known as hacktivism. Between 1999 and 2004,
the Chinese hacker community was defined by its regular use of large scale,
politically motivated attacks against foreign networks or Websites. Chinese hackers
traded Web defacements and distributed denial of service attacks with their
counterparts in the United States, Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, and South Korea and
operated with relative immunity from Chinese law until strongly worded
condemnations issued from Beijing eventually reigned in the attacks. Motivated by
nationalist fervor, often resulting from a perceived insult to China by a foreign country,
the leaders of hacker groups unified their members, identified targets, and often
disseminated attack tools via their Websites to ensure mass participation.

The 1999 comments by then Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui that Taiwan
deserved to be treated as an equal state by the PRC catalyzed massive PRC
hacker attacks on the Taiwan National Assembly, Presidential Executive Office
and many additional government Websites, according to Western press
reports of the exchange.72

•

In May 2001, the Honker Union of China claimed that it had attacked over
1,000 US Websites—approximately the same number that US hackers
claimed they attacked in the PRC—following the collision between a US EP-3
surveillance aircraft and a Chinese fighter.73

PRC government reaction to Chinese hacker group participation in the various
“hacker wars” from 1999 to 2002 was initially encouraging, lauding the efforts of the
various Chinese groups involved. By mid 2002 and after, however, this sentiment
changed and official Party media sources published editorials discouraging further
mass actions online, suggesting that hacking activities in any country were illegal and
would not be tolerated.74 The groups interpreted the editorial as state opposition to
future planned attacks and gradually stood down.
•

In 2001, following a large scale denial of service attack against the White
House, the People’s Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Party,
issued an editorial in its online edition that decried the Chinese attacks as
“Web terrorism,” and said that the attacks by the Honker Union of China on US
Websites were “unforgivable acts violating the law," effectively withdrawing
Beijing’s tacit and explicit support from the hacker groups’ campaigns.75

•

As government tolerance for large scale attacks against foreign networks
waned, many of the most prominent Chinese hacker organizations active in
the US-China and cross-Strait exchanges at the beginning of the decade
appear to have evolved into formal information security research companies
offering professional information security services. Many others simply
disbanded, or reorganized. Some of these groups or individuals have
developed relationships with companies close to PRC security organizations
or to the government itself.

The government’s position on these activities created a dynamic of self-censorship,76
and effectively deterred a general resurgence of similar large scale hacker wars.
Some groups, rallying around politically “safe” topics such as anti-Tibetan
independence, however, still attempt politically driven attacks on foreign Websites.
•

In December 2008, Chinese hackers associated with the Web group
hack4.com staged politically motivated Web defacements on French
Embassies in the US, United Kingdom, China, and Canada after French
President Sarkozy’s December 2008 visit with the Dalai Lama.

•

Chinese hackers attempted unsuccessfully to stage a large scale distributed
denial of service (DDoS) attack against CNN’s Website in April 2008, with
purpose-built malware that ordinary Internet users could employ in a crude but
potentially effective attack. The planning for the attack was exposed by a USbased information warfare expert on his blog and the volume of traffic against
CNN generated from this effort barely registered among Internet security
analysts as a denial of service attack.77

A February 2009 National People’s Congress expansion of China’s anti-hacking law,
coupled with a series of high profile arrests and harsh sentences for hacking crimes,
will possibly subject China’s online hacker communities to greater scrutiny and
possibly discourage some of the overt exchange of tools and hacking advice in open
online forums.
•

Previously China’s anti-hacking law only prohibited intrusions into PRC
government computer systems, technically leaving China’s hackers extremely
wide latitude for cybercriminal activities. The amendment also added a section
criminalizing the creation and dissemination of malicious software.78

•

Security authorities have already used the law for several high profile arrests
and convictions of both amateur and well-established hackers.

Hacktivist Support to the State
Little in the internal writings on Chinese INEW strategy or other writings on IW
theory or strategy suggests that the PLA or state security bureaus intend to
use hacktivist attacks as a component of a CNO campaign and there is little
compatibility between the principles of the INEW strategy as they are known
from open sources and the common characteristics of most hacktivist attacks.
While the simple absence of PLA discussions of the topic—or the absence of sources
in which it is discussed—does not prove an unwillingness to engage hacker groups in
these types of attacks, several factors argue against formal PLA plans to include
hacktivism as part of a CNO campaign in wartime.
•

Command and Control: The lack of an easily implemented command and
control structure from the PLA to the hacker community at large makes guiding
or directing attacks extremely difficult. Once initiated, hacktivist attacks have
the potential develop their own momentum and begin operating beyond the
PLA’s or civilian government’s ability to easily control the participants or their
targeting. Self-generating hacktivist attacks also have the potential to interfere
with sensitive CNO missions by inadvertently disrupting the PLA’s own
computer network attacks. Hacktivist attacks on a Chinese adversary may
also risk shutting down lines of communication in use for intelligence collection
or accidently overwhelm channels the PLA is using as feedback loops to
monitor the effectiveness of their network attacks.

•

Precision Targeting: The core principles that seem to guide the INEW strategy
are based on precision targeting and disciplined coordination to strike carefully
selected nodes of an enemy’s information systems judged to have maximum
operational impact. The goal is to establish control over the adversary’s ability
to access or disseminate information. Hacktivist target selection, in contrast, is
generally based on political or nationalist symbolism and not on an alignment
with real or perceived PLA campaign objectives and may actually hinder PLA
operations or intelligence gathering. Chinese hackers reportedly destroyed
large volumes of data on the US Web servers they attacked during the US EP3 crisis in April 2001.79 Similar data destruction against US military servers
during a conflict may eliminate valuable intelligence sources for the PLA or
destroy data already altered by the PLA as part of a larger deception or
perception management operation. Large scale distributed denial of service
attacks or high profile Web defacements can also potentially undo

backchannel or even overt diplomatic efforts to resolve a crisis or negate the
effects of carefully crafted psychological operations.
•

Indications and warning: Surprise and deception are central to the INEW
strategy and Chinese hacktivist attacks generally lack both. Online mass
organization is inherently public and while many hacker groups may implement
nominal vetting of members or attempt to close their discussion threads, there
is still a need to publicize the cause, announce the targets and if necessary,
disseminate tools; all of which greatly increases the likelihood that the plans
will be detected and successfully countered. The organizers of the attempted
CNN DDoS attack rescheduled their attack and changed Websites in part
because of publicity generated by the US-based researchers noted previously
who monitored the attack preparations on the Chinese hacker Websites and
alerted CNN.

Hacker-State Collaboration
While the PRC government appears reluctant to use hacktivism as a CNO tool,
there may be a willingness to establish direct relationships with highly skilled
individuals or small groups in the hacker community. The PRC government may
also be able to engage commercial firms comprised of experienced hackers and
operating as nominally legitimate information security groups. This engagement
ranges from simple job recruitment by government security ministries on hacker
Websites to possible support from blackhat code developers for organized intrusions
into US Government and commercial networks.
Commercially-based white hat information security researchers (i.e. those
pursuing overt legal research in the field) are developing extensive government
customer bases for hardware and possibly software support. Many of the most
prominent groups from earlier in the decade and their leaders have either disbanded
or transformed themselves into seemingly legitimate security firms. Large groups like
Xfocus and Black Eagle Base have reshaped themselves into commercial operations,
albeit in close alignment with state security and information security objectives.
•

80

NSFocus, a prominent commercial information security firm, evolved out of the
Green Army Alliance, an early—and prominent—hacker group active from
1997 through 2000; the NSFocus Website still retains logos of the Green Army
Alliance and the list of its founding members features some of the most
prominent hackers in China.80

XFocus, a commercial information security company that grew from a hacker
group, annually co-sponsors XCon, one of the largest “hacker conferences” in
China in partnership with NSFocus and Venus Technology.

•

Henan Provincial Public Security Bureau authorities shutdown The Patriot
Hackers-Black Eagle Base Website and arrested its members in February
2006. The group, however, was operational again six months later under the
name Black Eagle Honker Base when its members released a statement
claiming that the group vowed to focus its efforts on training people for the
state and working to improve the state’s network security industry, suggesting
a possible cooperative relationship with state authorities as a condition of their
release.81

•

The Black Eagle leadership also expressed appreciation to the State Security
Bureau (guojia anquan ju) and the Commission of Science and Technology in
National Defense (COSTIND, and now renamed SASTIND82) for the
educational guidance they provided to members while in custody. The latter,
entity, charged with overseeing national defense industry policy, is not typically
referenced in connection with hacker groups or their activities.83

Individuals, or possibly groups, engaged in computer network exploitation
against US networks have obtained malicious software developed by Chinese
underground or black hat programmers. The ability to obtain this custom code
indicates that these operators have ties to select members of the hacker
underground.
In one demonstrated instance, black hat programmers affiliated with Chinese hacker
forums provided malicious software to intruders targeting a US commercial firm in
early 2009. The techniques and tools employed by this group or individual are similar
to those observed in previous penetration attempts against this same company in the
previous year, according to their forensic analysis.
•

Forensic analysis also suggests this group is comprised of multiple members
of varying skill levels, operating with fixed schedules and standard operating
procedures and is willing to take detailed steps to mask their activities on the
targeted computer.

Open source research on the screen name of the coder who created the
malware used in the early 2009 attack revealed that the individual is likely a
native Chinese speaker who posted a keystroke logging program with rootkit
elements to a discussion board on a prominent Chinese hacker group
Website known as EvilOctal.

•

The coder created the PDF document used as the attachment to carry the
malicious software with a tool that is only available in Chinese called
FreePic2Pdf, version 1.26; this document was modified to covertly install a
zero day exploit that targeted a previously unknown vulnerability in Adobe
Acrobat.84

•

Upon successful installation on the victim system after the user opened the
attachment, the Trojan horse malware began periodically attempting to
connect with another machine overseas, essentially sending a beacon to let
the attackers know that a machine had been successfully attacked. The
intruders only completed this connection when they were ready to commence
the next phase of the operation via encrypted communications with the victim
computer.

•

The operators worked in a three shift, 24 hour cycle issuing reconnaissance
commands identical to those observed in previous attacks.

•

When significant differences were recognized between this computer and
previously compromised systems on the same network, the attack team
extracted small amounts of data to determine the configuration of security
software installed and their ability to access targeted data on the company’s
network.

•

The operators installed a rootkit, which gives the attacker privileged access to
a victim computer while remaining undetectable, suggesting the attackers
intended long-term covert use of the victim computer. The attackers
configured the rootkit to execute upon the next system reboot, effectively
hiding the operators’ files, programs, network connections and registry
settings, however, operator error caused a problem in the rootkit execution
and locked the attackers out of the targeted computer, ending the operation,
according to forensic analysis.

•

The rootkit code is still not publicly available, suggesting that the attacker
obtained it directly from the coder or someone with direct access to this
individual.

The creator of another zero day exploit used to target US companies in the fall
of 2008 developed the code in Chinese and on a machine with Chinese set as
the default language indicating that this individual was also likely a native or
fluent speaker. Little additional detail about the developer’s identity is available from
forensic analysis but it reinforces the assertion that a relationship exists between
Chinese black hat programmers and individuals responsible for intrusions into US
networks.
•

US companies began receiving small waves of spam-like emails with a
Microsoft WordPad (.wri) file attachment containing a small piece of malicious
software that acted as a Trojan, enabling the attackers to gain complete
access to the targeted computers, a hallmark of the computer network
exploitation tradecraft attributed to China. The malware exploited a zero day
vulnerability in Microsoft’s WordPad application.85

•

The attachment sent in these email attacks contained two components: an
English language carrier document that appears to be a generic contract
template for a defense firm to use with a sub-contractor, and the Chinese
language exploit code inserted inside the carrier document.

•

When the recipient of the apparent spam email attempted to open the attached
.pdf file, the file installed both the malware and a backdoor service on the
targeted machine that was designed to execute the next time the user logged
in.

The malware, sent in a wave of spearphishing attacks against various US
companies, was intended to provide the intruder with the ability to remotely
access and control the targeted computers, another common characteristic of
computer network exploitation activities attributed to China.
•

The newly installed service connects to an external host outside of the
targeted company’s network and allows the intruder to take control of the
victim's machine remotely with the same access and operational capabilities
as though they were sitting at the user’s keyboard.

Programming bugs in the malware used during the fall 2008 campaign and the
intruders’ ability to quickly obtain an earlier version as a replacement program,

44

US-China Economic and Security Review Commission
Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to

strongly suggests this was the first time the newer version was being used by these
attackers. Their ability to obtain a replacement version quickly may be the result of
having access to the developer or someone managing a repository of the developer’s
work. If the latter is true, it implies the existence of a support infrastructure for the
individuals targeting US Government and commercial networks. However, this is still
speculative and requires further research to corroborate.
•

The initial version of the malware was compiled in late October 2008 and used
within weeks by the intruders. This short time interval between the date of
creation and first use implies that the intruder (or intruders) had the means to
obtain customized zero-day malware quickly.

•

When they encountered operational problems with the code, the intruders
quickly obtained an older version of the malware, compiled in January 2008
and resumed their work with little delay.

Government Recruitment from Hacker Groups
Government efforts to recruit from among the Chinese hacker community and
evidence of consulting relationships between known hackers and security services
indicates some government willingness to draw from this pool of expertise. It does not
imply that authorities have established many such relationships or intends to enlist
whole groups for large attacks on US systems.
•

Between July 2007 and November 2008, an individual using the screen name
“City_93” posted job vacancy announcements for the Ministry of Public
Security’s First Research Institute (posting a Web address www.fri.com.cn) on
the discussion board for EvilOctal.com and XFocus.net, two of the largest and
in the case of XFocus, most established hacker forums in China.

•

“City_93” eventually posted 10 vacancy notices on Evil Octal between 2007
and 2008 and on both sites engaged in lengthy discussion threads on the
application procedures and nature of the job with interested users. The job
postings were for entry level programmers with experience in the development
and implementation of network security system projects.

The founding member of the influential Chinese hacker group Javaphile has a
formal consulting relationship with the Shanghai Public Security Bureau and
researcher credentials at the information security engineering institute of one
of China’s leading universities, according to an analysis of academic
publications, media reporting, and research done by an independent IW
analyst. Javaphile has an established history as a hacktivist group, leading attacks
on the White House and other networks during the hacker wars in 2001-2002 and is
still considered an active and influential group.
•

The co-founder of Javaphile, Peng Yinan, using the screen name
Coolswallow, created Javaphile while a student at Shanghai Jiaotong
University’s School of Information Security Engineering in 2000 according to
posts he made in 2003 on a Shanghai Jiaotong student online forum that has
since been removed.86 The group initially functioned solely as a java language
user group until the EP-3 incident catalyzed the members to convert Javaphile
into a hacker group. The members focused on developing tools, sharing

techniques and carrying out attacks on US Websites, according to postings the
group made on a student online forum.87
•

Independent research by a US IW specialist, Scott Henderson, linked Peng to
two screen names, CoolSwallow and Ericool, that he used regularly either on
his Javaphile Website or to publish essays on Buddhism on a separate
Website devoted to the subject where he was a member.

•

Henderson later identified Peng’s Shanghai Public Security Bureau consultant
credentials from a Shanghai Jiaotong University student newspaper story
about a lecture that Peng, an alumni of the Information Security Engineering
Institute, had given to students there called “Hacker in a Nutshell.” These
accounts and publicity posters also described Peng as an “experienced
hacker” (see Figure 5).88

•

Following this exposure on Henderson’s blog, the Coolswallow and Buddhist
society sites were taken down and little was heard in online hacker forums
from Coolswallow or Ericool for over a year.

Peng later published two articles in 2008 on computer network exploitation
techniques under his own name and listed as an affiliated researcher at

The PLA in 2005 reportedly held a series of regional or provincial hacker
competitions to identify talented civilians who could support military CNO
requirements, according to an uncorroborated Taiwan media source referencing an
article from a Sichuan university student newspaper.
•

Chinese hacker, Withered Rose (aka Tan Duilin), the former leader of the
prominent NCPH hacker group, allegedly won the competition in Sichuan, a
story which has been repeated often in Western media reporting but is difficult
to verify.

The accounts claim that representatives from the Sichuan Military Command
Communication Department apparently contacted Tan in 2005 directly and told
him to participate in the network attack and defense training event organized
by the provincial military command, in preparation for the coming Chengdu
Military Command Network Attack and Defense Competition later that year,
according to an interview conducted with him by the Sichuan University of
Science and Technology student newspaper.92 If true, the story implies that
the PLA was engaged in “talent scouting” within the hacker community and
organizing formal events such as this contest to aid the effort.

Commercial Support to Government CNO R&D
China’s long term investment in its high technology sectors is paying dividends for the
PLA as they have access to increasing numbers of domestic firms able to design,
build, and service advanced IT systems in support of PLA C4ISR and CNO
requirements. The ability to recruit these employees into militia units is only one
benefit that the government is deriving from the growth of the IT sector in China.
Some firms, such as Huawei, are well known in the West and occupy significant
market share in both China and abroad, but a host of other smaller firms like Venus
Technologies, also provide increasingly sophisticated platforms and technology to the
PLA and government security organizations.
•

Huawei is a well established supplier of specialized telecommunications
equipment, training and related technology to the PLA that has, along with
others such as Zhongxing, and Datang, received direct funding for R&D on
C4ISR systems capabilities. All of these firms originated as state research
institutes and continue to receive preferential funding and support from the
PLA.93

•

ZTE Corp, another of China’s large telecommunications manufacturers, and
Huawei, also provide certification training and related engineering training to
PLA personnel assigned to communications and IW related positions,
according to provincial level Communist Party military newspapers.94

•

Civilian IT companies have provided personnel to staff IW militia units that are
tasked with both CNA and CND missions during wartime and extensive CNE
missions during peacetime.95

•

Venus Technologies Inc, which has close ties to the hacker groups XFocus
and NSFocus, is also a well known provider of information security and
computer network operations expertise to the PLA and dozens of other entities

launch facility located in Inner Mongolia.96
To date, the evidentiary record regarding the PLA’s or other state security groups’
use of Chinese hackers to conduct network exploitation activities against US
networks remains highly anecdotal. Western media reports that claim that the PRC
government has recruited an “internet army” from among the millions of Chinese
hackers, are spurious at best. The limited reporting available from open sources,
however, does suggest that some precedent exists for state security organizations to
seek computer network operations expertise from individuals with sophisticated
hacker skill sets. How these organizations are using the talent they recruit, the
numbers of individuals involved in possible state sponsored CNO activities, and how
these individuals are integrated—if at all—into ongoing cyber intelligence operations
all bear careful scrutiny and continued research.

Cyber-Espionage97
Foreign intelligence services have discovered that unclassified US government and
private sector information, once unreachable or requiring years of expensive
technological or human asset preparation to obtain, can now be accessed,
inventoried, and stolen with comparative ease using computer network operations
tools. The return on present investment for targeting sensitive US information in this
way (the intelligence gain) can be extraordinarily high while the barriers to entry (the
skills and technologies required to implement an operation) are comparatively low.
Many countries are in the process of developing capabilities to either respond
defensively to this threat or build their own offensive network operations programs,
however, China is most frequently cited as the primary actor behind much of the
activity noted in media reporting, and US officials are increasingly willing to publicly
acknowledge that China’s network exploitation and intelligence collection activities
are one of this country’s most consuming counterintelligence challenges.
China’s development of its computer network operations capability extends beyond
preparations for wartime operations. The PLA and state security organizations have
begun employing this capability to mount a large scale computer network exploitation
effort for intelligence gathering purposes against the US and many countries around
the world, according to statements by US officials, accusations by targeted foreign
governments, and a growing body of media reporting on these incidents.
A long term, persistent campaign to collect sensitive but unclassified information from
US Government and US defense industry networks using computer network
exploitation techniques, long attributed to China, has successfully exfiltrated at least
10 to 20 terabytes of data from US Government networks as of 2007, according to
US Air Force estimates and that figure has possibly grown in the past two years,
though no figure is publicly available.

US-China Economic and Security Review Commission
Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to

General James Cartwright, while serving as the Combatant Commander of US
Strategic Command, testified before a Congressional commission that China is
actively engaging in cyber reconnaissance by probing the computer networks of U.S.
government agencies as well as private companies. He further noted that the
intelligence collected from these computer reconnaissance campaigns can be used
for myriad purposes, including identifying weak points in the networks, understanding
how leaders in the United States think, discovering the communication patterns of
American government agencies and private companies, and attaining valuable
information stored throughout the networks.98
A review of the scale, focus, and complexity of the overall campaign directed
against the United States and, increasingly, a host of other countries around
the world strongly suggest that these operations are state-sponsored or
supported. The operators appear to have access to financial, personnel, and
analytic resources that exceed what organized cybercriminal operations or multiple
hacker groups operating independently could likely access consistently over several
years. Furthermore, the categories of data stolen do not have inherent monetary
value like credit card numbers or bank account information that is often the focus of
cybercriminal organizations. Highly technical defense engineering information,
military related information, or government policy analysis documents are not easily
monetized by cybercriminals unless they have a nation-state customer, making the
activity “state-sponsored” by default, regardless of the affiliation of the actual
operators at the keyboard.
The scope of operational activities, deep knowledge of the targeted networks, and
volume and topics of data exfiltrated suggest that the attackers are supporting
consumers involved in defense related engineering research, policy specialists
interested in US-China relations, and military planners gathering intelligence on US
military information systems and operations.
US Government officials assess that this activity, in the aggregate, has the potential
to erode the United States’ long term position as a world leader in S&T innovation
and competitiveness and the collection of US defense engineering data has possibly
saved the recipient of the information years of R&D and significant amounts of
funding.99

US-China Economic and Security Review Commission

These operations are succeeding in part because current industry and US
government information security paradigms are largely based on reactive
controls such as traditional signature-based anti-virus vendor models,
common host and network defensive measures that are often inadequate
against advanced attackers. When a product vendor or the research community
discloses new security vulnerabilities, security software vendors rapidly analyze it and
produce “signatures,” or encoded representations of the anticipated effects of an
attack against this new vulnerability. These signatures are applied to network control
devices such as Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) and firewalls,
and on individual computers as anti-virus rules or host IDS/IPS signatures. Adding
signatures proactively to these systems without prior knowledge of a vulnerability or
possibly an observed or lab-generated sample attack, is difficult and often
discouraged.
•

Many organizations are reluctant to patch systems and software against
vulnerabilities for which there have not been publicly released exploits. Larger
organizations with more mature security practices or resources often use
complex behavioral signatures, or models, applied to Security Event and
Information Management (SEIM) or Network Behavioral Analysis (NBA)
systems but these techniques are usually fed by component signature-based
systems, they, too, suffer the same shortcomings.

•

NBA systems show greater promise when tuned to look for anomalous
behavior, however, there is generally much greater administrative overhead
and a high false alarm rate in this mode.

•

Traditional network and system management is a balancing act of
performance, expense and security and common wisdom dictates a certain
hesitance to make changes on functioning, often critical, systems.

These operators exploit this reactive defense model and they have the
resources necessary to develop and exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities
that are often are missed by signature-based IDS/IPS and endpoint protection
software. The Chinese academic community and hacker groups—like many hacker
groups around the world—are heavily focused on researching new zero-day
vulnerabilities.
•

Anecdotal reporting from information security industry sources suggest that
Chinese researchers are also willing to purchase zero day attack tools from
third party sources, though this has not been independently corroborated.

53

US-China Economic and Security Review Commission
Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to

•

Zero day exploits are bought and sold in numerous public and private markets
without the involvement of the victim software's vendors, often for tens of
thousands of dollars per vulnerability.100

The overall effort likely consists of multiple groups and skilled individuals
operating against different targets given the high operational tempo and
diversity of targeting observed to date (see Timeline of Alleged Chinese
Intrusions below). These operators, some possibly affiliated with PRC government
or military organizations and others probably freelance hackers, have access to
software developers capable of developing zero day exploits and using tools that are
often created on computers with Chinese language settings or Chinese language
developer kits.
•

The adversaries associated with this issue are successful because they are
able maintain a presence on a targeted network for extended periods enabling
them establish a connection to a compromised computer on the network when
operationally required for activities such as reconnaissance of the network
topology, determining where high value information resides, or to conduct
social and professional network analysis to support future spearphishing
campaigns.

•

This latter information is exploited most frequently to craft specific, seemingly
legitimate-looking, emails to targeted users often referencing a current project
or meeting with which the recipient is involved. The emails usually contain
either malicious software embedded in an attachment or links to malicious
Websites.101

•

The scale and complexity of targeting associated with this effort suggests that
it is probably backed by a mature collection management bureaucracy able to
collate and disseminate collection priorities to diverse teams of operators,
intelligence analysts, and malware developers. These individuals are likely a
mix of uniformed military personnel, civilian intelligence operators, and
freelance high-end hackers.

These types of attacks often begin with an email message with a file attached
containing both the exploit code and another small piece of software which will give
the attacker control of the victim's computer. When this file, usually an image,

document, or spreadsheet is opened by the vulnerable program on the victim's
computer (e.g. Powerpoint, Wordpad, Adobe Acrobat, etc), the backdoor program
executes. Email is the most common entry vector because the operators are often
able to learn an employee’s (or group of employees’) trust relationships (i.e. their
professional networks) by analyzing who they frequently email. The intruders then
craft credible looking emails from members or groups within an individual’s network
that the target will likely open. 102

•

The operators often reuse the employee’s profiles generated by this
reconnaissance in multiple targeting attempts either because the user failed to
open the attachment the first time or simply because they are an “easy mark”
who usually opens these emails and thus represent a reliable entry vector for
the intruders.

•

This initial penetration with email and malicious attachment is frequently only
the first phase of an advanced operation as the users targeted first and the
data on their computers are often not the actual target of collection. Targeting
the data owners of the attacker’s actual collection objective increases the risk
of detection and possible implementation of tighter controls around the data
they are seeking to exfiltrate, making later attempts more difficult.

Analysis of forensic data associated with penetrations attributed to
sophisticated state sponsored operators suggests that in some operations
multiple individuals are possibly involved, responsible for specific tasks such
as gaining and establishing network access, surveying portions of the targeted
network to identify information of value, and organizing the data exfiltration.
One role is an entry or “breach team” tasked only with gaining entry and maintaining
a flexible, redundant presence in the target network (essentially “picking the lock” and
ensuring not only that the door stays open, but that there are multiple doors available
if the one being used is “closed”). Once the breach team has successfully
established access to the network, a possible second team or individual conducts the
data reconnaissance and ultimately locates and exfiltrates targeted data.
Reasons for using different individuals or groups could be due to the specialized skills
required for each phase of an intrusion or perhaps for “compartmentation” reasons:
the first team or operator does not need to know the details of what is being targeted
by the second team or operator, thus ideally, improving overall operational security.
These explanations are, however, largely speculative as the fidelity of data on these
incidents almost never provides insight into the internal communications, identity, or
relationship dynamics of the actual people behind these intrusions.
•

This type of task oriented structure requires multiple skill sets, possibly
requiring several individuals to complete one operation. This model, if
accurate, also implies some means of recruiting, organizing, and managing a
team like this and ensuring proper completion of a given mission. If this model
is indeed accurate and it is being replicated across dozens of intrusions over
time, then that oversight structure must be proportionately larger and more
complex as well.

56

US-China Economic and Security Review Commission
Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to

•

Once the breach team or individual has secured a foothold on the first victim’s
computer, they also continue to collect information about this machine’s
security configuration, settings, and related system information to solidify their
presence, sometimes by sniffing and stealing passwords from authentication
systems, collecting user email to support future deceptive attacks, gather
network usernames, group membership information and directory listings of
network shared folders.

•

Operators have also attacked mobile users’ virtual private network (VPN)
software, which allows employees of a company to access their corporate
network while outside of the office. Operators have modified VPN software to
allow access back into the network through the remote user's systems.
Attackers have on occasion installed additional network software to mask their
remote control communications, such as encryption rootkits that hide the
attackers’ presence from legitimate system administrators.

•

All of these steps help ensure long-term access to the target organization's
network and help provide freedom of movement to the attackers once inside
the network.

These attackers have also demonstrated an awareness of a targeted
organization’s information security measures according to forensic analysis of
attacker activity, and appear able to alter their operations to avoid detection,
reflecting the highly detailed reconnaissance that they—or others on their
behalf—conduct. The attackers in these operations likely use tools or techniques
that are only as sophisticated as they need to be for the environment in which they
are operating, holding their more capable tools in reserve until genuinely required.
•

Attackers have demonstrated some ability to respond to adjustments in
security configurations to ensure maximum time “on station” to accomplish
their collection mission. These responses include, but are not limited to,
shifting to stealthier communications channels, jumping to different C2 servers,
the rapid deletion of toolkits upon detection of defender presence and the
harvesting of configuration files to support further target analysis.

•

The individuals responsible for maintaining access have demonstrated
flexibility in responding to unexpected changes in network defenses by the
targeted organization, suggesting they prepare for these contingencies in
advance, similar to conducting an “enemy course of action” analysis.
Generally, this preparation has involved the pre-placement of redundant
communication channels, C2 nodes on multiple external servers, and multiple
breach points in a targeted network (usually other computers in the targeted

57

US-China Economic and Security Review Commission
Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to
Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation

network that have already been compromised and are held in reserve until
needed).
•

The malware that these operators employ often tries to communicate with (or
“beacon” to) a pre-established command and control server located in a
variety of countries. This beaconing can continue for extended periods of time
before the operators are ready to engage, establish a connection with and
then take control over the victim system.

Additional individuals or teams probably tasked with the collection of the
actual targeted information, have demonstrated greater skill and highly detailed
knowledge of the targeted networks. Their efforts to locate and move data off of
the network often involves techniques that place a premium on redundancy, stealth
and comprehensiveness of preparation and attention to detail.
•

Using network intelligence likely gathered during earlier reconnaissance
efforts, these collection teams have in some cases copied the data from the
servers and workstations to a second server that acts as a “staging point”
where they compress, encrypt, segment and replicate it before distributing it
through encrypted channels out of the targeted organization to multiple
external servers that act as “drop points.”

•

These drop points may also play an obfuscation role, ensuring that
investigators are unable to identify the data’s final destination.

China’s defense industry is producing new generations of weapon platforms with
impressive speed and quality, and while these advancements are due to a variety of
domestic factors, Chinese industrial espionage is providing a source of new
technology without the necessity of investing time or money to perform research.
Computer network exploitation in support of these collection requirements has
possibly expanded the range and detail of information available for collection in a way
that previously required close HUMINT-enabled access to obtain the data (e.g. an
agent inside or close proximity to a US citizen and their laptop or other electronics).
Chinese espionage in the United States, which now comprises the single greatest
threat to U.S. technology, according to US counterintelligence officials,103 is straining
the U.S. capacity to respond. This illicit activity both from traditional techniques and
computer-based activity are possibly contributing to China’s military modernization
and its acquisition of new technical capabilities.

Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to
Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation

Operational Profile of An Advanced Cyber Intrusion
The following case study is based wholly upon an internal post-incident forensics
investigation and discussions with information security specialists from a single
affected firm following a penetration and data exfiltration by intruders likely
associated with a state sponsored operation. The company’s internal analysis of
the incident indicates that the attacks came through, or originated from, China and
many of the techniques are consistent with the operational profile attributed to other
attacks believed to originate from China. This case study reflects the details of only
a single incident. Private sector firms—even within a given industry—frequently
employ a variety of information security tools and strategies based on their unique
network architecture and approaches to risk management.

Information security analysts at a large US commercial firm several years ago
detected a high volume of data being sent from their network to multiple computers in
the US and overseas, with many aspects of the activity matching the profile often
associated with other state sponsored attacks. The analysts quickly began putting
blocks in place on their network to halt the data loss but not before significant
volumes of data were lost to the intruders.
The scale of this operation, which also targeted other large US companies within a
several week period suggests a disciplined command and control structure, a means
of sharing specific data collection requirements for various targeted companies and
the capability to collate and process extremely large volumes of data once exfiltrated.
Additionally, in this specific incident at least, the attackers selected the data for
exfiltration with great care. Though they had the opportunity, they did not simply
“take what they could get” and leave, rather, they chose specific files, often ignoring
related information in adjacent directory locations, activity which suggests these
attackers were disciplined and operating from a specific list of collection
requirements, a characteristic usually only found in highly professional operations.
During the incident described below, the attackers did not open and review file
contents—though they had the required file permissions—but instead navigated
immediately to the files or folders they wanted and began the steps necessary to
exfiltrate them, suggesting that they had reviewed the directory contents offline and
that they had already gained access to this firm’s network to conduct detailed
reconnaissance, including the possible exfiltration of file directory listings.
These types of operational techniques are not characteristic of amateur hackers
operating in widely dispersed geographic areas. While the affiliation of the individual
operators is impossible to establish, the coordination required to stage this operation
suggests that even if these were freelance operators not directly affiliated with a state
or military organization, they had professional quality organization and discipline and
a specific set of collection objectives, evidenced as much by what they didn’t take—

59

US-China Economic and Security Review Commission
Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to
Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation

despite having easy access to the data—as what they did take. The type and
specificity of data stolen in this case also suggests that the end users were already
identified and that they likely had deep science and technology resources at their
disposal to make use of the stolen information.
While attribution is always the most difficult component of information security
investigations, hackers—individuals and groups alike—tend to operate in a consistent
manner, exhibiting a preference for specific tools, possess a unique keyboard
presence,104 and often tend to target the same types of data across their targets.
This case is consistent with other incidents attributed to Chinese intrusions into US
networks though no firm attribution data was available from this case.
Over a multi-day period during this incident, intruders staged a complex data
exfiltration operation and while the activity associated with this incident
occurred within a relatively short span of time, the preparations and
reconnaissance necessary to support it had likely been ongoing for months.
The teams or individuals who carried out this operation displayed discipline and a
deep knowledge of the network architecture they targeted, suggesting that these
operators had likely spent months patiently assembling a detailed picture of this
network.
•

Identical remote communication and administrative tools and operational
techniques were used in earlier incidents with this and other companies; they
operated at times using a communication channel between a host with an IP
address located in the People’s Republic of China and a server on the
company’s internal network, a technique observed consistently in similar
intrusions at other commercial firms.

•

Analysis of the operation suggests that the adversaries previously identified
specific directories, file shares, servers, user accounts, employee full names,
password policies, and group memberships on the network, likely during their
detailed reconnaissance phase.

•

They did not open any files to review the contents prior to exfiltration,
suggesting they already knew the contents or at a minimum, the file names of
the data they were tasked with stealing.

104

An individual’s “keyboard behavior” in the context of computer network intrusions refers to the
specific habits that a hacker might develop over the course of performing certain functions many times.
The sophistication, frequency, combination of commands, and elapsed time between keyboard entries
can all help in the creation of a “forensic profile” an individual attacker.

60

US-China Economic and Security Review Commission
Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to
Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation

The adversary used at least two groups in the operation; a breach team (referred to
by these information security analysts as “Team One”) and a collection team (known
as “Team Two”), responsible for gathering and exfiltrating the targeted data.
•

Each team employed distinct toolkits and used them in unique ways
suggesting not only different operational goals but also different individuals at
the keyboard.

•

The teams maintained a base of instrumented hosts on the company’s
network that they held in reserve for use as required at external locations to
support their covert communications for an extended period of time.

Prior to this data exfiltration, the company’s information security analysts had
detected activity attributed to these types of sophisticated attackers, but it was
generally characterized by low volumes of traffic through compromised hosts and
appeared primarily focused on maintaining access and presence. The company’s
information security staff detected and countered these compromises in the months
prior to the final data exfiltration, however, the attackers’ appear to have simply
created new entry vectors or reverted back to other pre-established means of
accessing the company’s network. The reconnaissance phase seems to have been
sufficiently methodical and quiet to permit the compilation of an accurate map of the
network over time. The adversary identified servers, file shares, individual
employees, user groups, and the credentials necessary to support a complex data
exfiltration operation later.

Intruder Command and Control Infrastructure
Analysis of the intruders’ activity prior to, and during, the exfiltration
operation indicates that their command and control architecture relied upon
previously stolen valid user accounts to authenticate to the company’s
internal servers. Once authenticated, they established communications with a
variety of previously compromised computers inside the company’s network. The
operators then tunneled Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) within their existing
communication channels to establish contact with the targeted hosts for purposes
ranging from maintaining basic access to the control of the eventual data
exfiltration. Additional stolen account names and passwords were used as needed
to gain access to otherwise protected resources such as computers, network
shares, folders and files.
•

Analysis of proxy logs and forensic data revealed that the operators used
dozens of employee accounts on almost 150 occasions to access the
network in the days leading up to the exfiltration.

•

At times, they used highly privileged administrative accounts and passed
NTLM hashes in lieu of passwords directly to the proxy authentication
mechanism.105 The use of password hashes, which were harvested directly
from compromised domain controllers, appears designed to defeat any twofactor authentication (T-FA) techniques that may have been in place to
defend against brute-force password cracking tools.

•

The use of NTLM hashes, which were harvested from domain controllers
using password collection tools, appears designed to defeat any multifactor
authentication techniques that may have been in place to defend against
brute-force password cracking tools.

•

The adversary also repeatedly enumerated group membership of accounts
in the organization’s primary domain, which assisted them in the identifying
which employee accounts to use when trying to access files restricted to
certain users.

105

Many proxy servers can be configured to require an NTLM challenge/response authentication
before access is granted to the protected resource, such as Internet/WWW/FTP access. If an
attacker is in possession of the authentication hashes, they can use the hash directly, rather than
first “crack” the password, then re-hash it for the authentication service.

Movement of Targeted Data to Intermediate “Staging Servers”
During the first several days of this incident, the adversary transferred the data
selected for exfiltration from company file servers (where it normally resided) to
Microsoft Exchange email servers that acted as intermediate staging points (See
Figure 7, the transfer occurred between the Staging Systems and the Corporate
File Servers in this diagram). Their reconnaissance of the network enabled them to
select servers that offered the highest performance and network throughput. The
identification and selection of these servers, again, underscores the adversary’s
precise knowledge of this network’s architecture, gained from detailed
reconnaissance prior to this operation.
The attackers began the preparations for moving data from the files servers to the
staging points by establishing clear lines of command and control and identifying
the appropriate hosts to use for the staging and exfiltration phases of the
operation. Analysis of the available data indicates that the adversaries, using
standard Windows file transfer tools, moved targeted data from the shares to the
staging servers.
•

Operators likely associated with the collection team (Team 2), using an
internal host as a C2 node, established multiple connections through
encrypted RDP sessions to various internal email servers prior to staging
data on these machines.

•

Forensic data revealed an increase of short duration communications
between the internal hosts used as C2 nodes and email servers in the days
prior to the staging operation. This process was likely to identify and
confirm the resources that would be used in all phases of the subsequent
operation.

•

Concurrent with this activity, the adversaries also established
communications between the email servers used for the exfiltration
operation and an external Website that was likely under their control. The
attackers used this as their primary C2 channel to control at least seven of
the internal email servers while they prepared their operation (see the
external drop points in Figure 7).

After moving data to staging servers, the operators renamed all targeted files with
nondescript labels to resemble a legitimate Windows application likely selected to
appear innocuous on the staging servers.
•

Once the transfer to staging servers was complete, the attackers encrypted
and compressed the files into numbered volumes of RAR archives—all

63

US-China Economic and Security Review Commission
Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to
Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation

exactly the same size—in preparation for exfiltration.106
•

Information security analysts within the company noted that the tools and
techniques used for this process closely matched that used in previously
detected activity on the organization’s network, confirming either that this
was the same entity or that operators responsible for different intrusions
have a means of sharing data about their targets or activities.

Exfiltration of Data from the Internal Network
Reflecting their methodical preparations, these operators used seven
servers almost in tandem to move data out of the company’s network,
suggesting that speed was a priority during this phase of the operation. The
movement of data out of the internal network is the most vulnerable phase of the
entire operation because of defensive tools the company had in place on its
network perimeter and was the only point that they were detected during their
multi-day presence in the network in preparation for this action.
The final stage of the exfiltration operation began in the evening (local time for this
firm), after all of the targeted data was staged on the intermediate hosts. Prior to
starting the exfiltration, the operators prepared with characteristic care:
establishing an overarching C2 channel, testing their connections, possibly
rehearsing their procedures, and checking their available bandwidth before
beginning the actual exfiltration.
•

After the commencement of the exfiltration from a single email server,
operators enumerated all of the email servers in the targeted areas. This
was significant because their request used the company’s standard internal
naming convention for these servers in the geographic area where the
servers were located, knowledge that is obtained only through highly
detailed reconnaissance of the network.107 The command returned a list of
several dozen servers, 75 percent of which they used in the operation as
either staging or exfiltration points.

•

The teams involved in the operation prepared for the actual exfiltration by

106

Of note, the RAR archives were all exactly 650MB in size, the maximum capacity of a standard
CD ROM, indicating a possible future storage or transfer medium.
107
Organizations with networks dispersed over large geographic regions often use a naming
convention for their servers that identifies the physical location of the server, followed by internal
company organizational details or a code to represent the server’s role, e.g. a print server located in
Montana in the XY Division may be internally named “MTXYP012.” In this case, the attackers knew
the exact convention that their target used and searched for all of the servers in the geographic
area where their targeted data was located.

64

US-China Economic and Security Review Commission
Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to

directing each of the servers that would be used to move data out of the
company to access a large video file (over 20MB) from an internal server
not otherwise targeted or involved in the overall operation. In each case,
the connection was terminated by the attackers after receiving only a short
portion of the video. This truncated downloading suggest they were not
attempting to view the contents of the file itself, but likely testing the
available bandwidth for transporting large volumes of data.
The attackers, operating with a valid user account, controlled one of the company’s
desktop machines which they used as a C2 node to direct the multiple servers
involved in the overall exfiltration operation (the company’s analysts identified a
total of four desktop machines used as C2 nodes). This particular C2 node
connected to multiple internal servers, including one staging server, two other
known intermediate hosts, and an external IP address located in the United States.
•

One of the internal C2 hosts established a connection to a DSL customer of
a commercial US-based Internet service provider. This proxy connection
remained open for the entire exfiltration phase. During that time, this node
connected via RDP into at least eight external hosts, one of which was
located in Hong Kong.108

•

Forensic analysis of the traffic flow in this incident indicates that the
attackers moved large volumes of data from the staging servers to those
used as a forwarding point for exfiltration out of the company’s networks
(the connection between “Exfiltration Hosts” and “External Drop Points”
Figure 7).

The Team One operators responsible for penetrating the information security
defenses possibly rehearsed their portion of the operation using innocuous files
prior to actually commencing the data exfiltration, then attempted to send three
RAR archive files via independent FTP sessions.
Analysis of the operators’ command channel activity indicates that they
encountered serious problems with two external hosts intended to receive data
exfiltrated from this company’s network. They also attempted custom FTP client
and server software, but it failed for unknown reasons. The operators abandoned
one of these servers and the custom FTP software, likely due to the slow and
unreliable data transfer rates, and continued with standard FTP server software
running on five more reliable remote hosts for the remainder of the data exfiltration.
108

The Hong Kong connection was unsuccessful and probably accidental given the careful steps
taken to use US-based servers to receive the data once it started flowing. The probable accident
does potentially identify one of the adversary’s external resources, possibly used to receive data
from the US servers once the operation was complete.

65

US-China Economic and Security Review Commission
Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to
Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation

•

On the final day of the operation, at approximately the same time in the
evening that they started each day previously, the operators established an
FTP connection from one of the internal exfiltration servers to an external
host. They verified that their communication channel was working properly
by uploading a zero byte file followed by a much larger file. Apparently
satisfied that this connection functioned properly, the operators logged out
of this internal server.

•

The operators reconnected within half an hour to this same internal server,
and using the same credentials attempted to move the first encrypted RAR
file containing the company’s proprietary data. Two minutes later, they
attempted to move another file, and then logged out. Minutes later, they
reconnected and attempted to move a third file. In each instance, the FTP
connections terminated prematurely for unknown reasons. It appears that
while small file transfers were successful across this channel, large file
transfers caused it to fail.

•

They then attempted to transfer files to a new remote FTP server using
custom FTP software that provided an additional layer of encryption. The
attacker’s FTP software implemented a custom command, “SORT”, issued
by the client and recognized by the server as a signal to receive encrypted
communications in lieu of a normal, unencrypted, file transfer. This same
software was then tried almost immediately on a new remote host, and
again it failed to complete a test transfer. In a final test, they connected back
to their first remote server which was now running their custom FTP server
software, and attempted a transfer; it too failed.

•

They then connected to a second US university and succeeded in manually
moving large RAR files using unmodified FTP server software. Shortly
thereafter, the operators established a series of automated, redundant,
transfers to five remote hosts, all running this same server software, in an
effort to maximize the success rate of this main data exfiltration effort.

The information security staff eventually detected and blocked the exfiltration in
mid-stream but not before significant amounts of company data left the network.
Intrusion prevention systems on the company’s network were then tuned to alert
and block further activity and for the next five hours these systems continued to
detect attempts by the operators to return, suggesting that they were interrupted
before completing the full exfiltration as planned. Information security analysts with
this firm have no means of determining the total intended size of this exfiltration
operation.

March 2009: A Canadian research team publishes a study of the GhostNet cyber
espionage network that targeted over 1,300 hosts around the world including those
at the German, Indian, Pakistani and Portuguese embassies around the world and
the Tibetan Government in Exile in India. The Canadian-based Information
Warfare Monitor (IWM) notes the compromise of numerous government and
private information processing systems across 103 countries. The operators
responsible for the network all operated from Hainan Island in China. The Chinese
government denies all accusations of responsibility or state sponsorship.138
March 2009: The Philippine Daily Inquirer publishes a report citing the GhostNet
study’s assertion that the computer network of the Philippines’ Department of
Foreign Affairs (DFA) has been hacked by cyber spies based in China.139
April 2009: Media reports the German government records daily attacks against its
networks, many from Chinese based operators. the German Foreign Office is
heavily targeted the reports note and are penetrated via socially engineered
email.140
April 2009: Australian media reports that Chinese cyber spies are targeting the
Australian Prime Minister via email and mobile phones. The Chinese government
denies all accusations.141
April 2009: Media sources report that hackers based in China infiltrated the
Intranet of South Korea’s Finance Ministry, causing concern over the potential theft
of sensitive government data. The cyber attackers used socially engineered emails
to target ministry staff. The email, disguised to look as though sent from one or
more trusted officials, executed malicious software when opened allowing the
attackers to access the systems.142

Glossary of Technical Terms
Backbone – A primary transit network or series of networks, designed to carry
data between different local area networks. A backbone generally has greater
data carrying capacity, or “bandwidth”, than the networks connected to it. The
Internet Backbone is the interconnection of high-speed networks, primarily
government, commercial telecommunications and academic networks that
route data for public Internet users.
Backdoor – A method of regaining remote control of a victim’s computer by
reconfiguring installed legitimate software or the installation of a specialized
program designed to allow access under attacker-defined conditions. Trojan
horse programs and rootkits often contain backdoor components.
Black hat - A computer hacker who is intent on causing damage or taking other
unauthorized or illegal actions against a victim.
C2 – Command and control. The term, in the context of computer network
operations, often describes a communications method or a component thereof
to maintain remote control of an operational asset, such as a compromised
computer.
Coder – A computer programmer or one who writes computer programming
language code.
Computer Network Attack (CNA) – Actions taken through the use of computer
networks to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in
computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves.
(See: http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp3_13.pdf).
Computer network defense (CND) – Actions taken through the use of computer
networks to protect, monitor, analyze, detect and respond to unauthorized
activity within information systems and computer networks (See:
http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp3_13.pdf).
Computer network exploitation (CNE) – Enabling operations and intelligence
collection capabilities conducted through the use of computer networks to
gather data from target or adversary automated information systems or
networks (See: http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp3_13.pdf).
Computer network operations (CNO) - Comprised of computer network attack,
computer network defense, and related computer network exploitation enabling
operations (See http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp3_13.pdf).

Distributed denial of service (DDoS) – A class of attacks that results in the
exhaustion of computing or communications resources by engaging many
intermediate computers to simultaneously attack one victim. These
intermediate attack systems are often previously compromised and under the
control of the attacker.
Electronic Warfare (EW) – Any military action involving the use of
electromagnetic and directed energy to control the electromagnetic spectrum or
to attack the enemy. The three major subdivisions within electronic warfare
are: electronic attack, electronic protection, and electronic warfare support.
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) - A standard Internet protocol implemented in FTP
server and client software, including most web browsers. It is used to “transfer
data reliably and efficiently.” http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc959.txt
Hacker – An individual who uses computer technology in ways not originally
intended by the vendor. Commonly the term is applied to people who attack
others using computers.
For the purposes of this discussion, hackers are subdivided as follows:
•

•

•
•

Script kiddies: Unskilled attackers who do not have the ability to discover new
vulnerabilities or write exploit code, and are dependent on the research and
tools from others. Their goal is achievement. Their sub-goals are to gain
access and deface web pages.
Worm and virus writers: Attackers who write the propagation code used in the
worms and viruses but not typically the exploit code used to penetrate the
systems infected. Their goal is notoriety. Their sub-goals are to cause
disruption of networks and attached computer systems.
Security researchers and white hat operators: This group has two subcategories: bug hunters and exploit coders. Their goal is profit. Their subgoals are to improve security and achieve recognition with an exploit.
Professional hacker-black hat: Individuals who get paid to write exploits or
actually penetrate networks; this group also falls into the same two subcategories as above. Their goal is also profit (See: http://www.uscert.gov/control_systems/csthreats.html).

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) – The message format and exchange
standard used by web browsers and web servers.

77

US-China Economic and Security Review Commission
Report on the Capability of the People’s Republic of China to

Hacktivism – Computer hacking intended to communicate a social or political
message, or to support the position of a political or ideological group. Hactivism
activities include data theft, website defacement, denial of service, redirects
and others.
Hacktivist – An attacker who practices hacktivism.
INFOCON - Information Operations Condition (INFOCON) classifications mirror
Defense Conditions (DEFCON) Alert System and are a uniform system of five
progressive readiness conditions– INFOCON 5 thru INFOCON 1 with
INFOCON 5 being a level of normal readiness and INFOCON 1 a level of
maximum readiness, implemented because of severe threat or attack. As the
INFOCON levels increase, elements of network functionality or services
deemed lower priority or at high risk of attack may be temporarily suspended.
Thus, CNA tools that work during a normal state of readiness may be rendered
ineffective if the services or applications they exploit are turned off.
Information Warfare (IW) – Actions taken to achieve information superiority by
affecting adversary information, information-based processes, information
systems, and computer-based networks while defending one’s own information,
information-based processes, information systems, and computer-based
networks (See: http://www.jpeocbd.osd.mil/packs/DocHandler.ashx?DocId=3712)
Intrusion Detection System (IDS) – A computer or network monitoring system
that matches observations against patterns of known or suspected
unauthorized activity.
Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) – An inline system or software that applies
IDS-style logic and approves or rejects network traffic, program and data
access, hardware use, etc.
Network Behavioral Analysis (NBA) – An intrusion detection system that models
network traffic and alerts on violations of known acceptable activity. Rules can
include data volume, time of day, traffic rate, communication partners, content,
and other elements.
NIPRNET – Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network. The unclassified
network of the US Department of Defense which provides Internet access as
well as interconnectivity to DoD users and facilities.
NTLM - A Microsoft authentication protocol that uses cryptographic hash
representations of account passwords. (See: http://msdn.microsoft.com/enus/library/aa378749(VS.85).aspx)

PDF – File format and filename extension for Adobe Portable Document Format
documents.
Phishing – The practice of enticing a victim to visit a website or other online
resource with the intention of stealing credentials, financial information such as
bank accounts, or credit card numbers. Phishing attacks generally involve an
email claiming to come from a trusted entity such as a bank or ecommerce
vendor, with a link to a website and the instructions to click the link and take
actions once at the website.
RAR or Roshal Archive - A compressed file format similar in use to the more
popular ZIP format. It is used to conserve storage and network resources and
simplifies the movement of large sets of files. Optional encryption is available
using the NIST Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm. Just as ZIP archives
are created with software such as WinZip (http://www.winzip.com) and zip
(http://www.info-zip.org), RAR archives are created with WinRar and RAR
(http://www.rarlab.com)
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) - The communication protocol used to provide
remote viewing and control of Microsoft Windows computers and applications.
For additional information (See http://msdn.microsoft.com/enus/library/aa383015(VS.85).aspx).
Rootkit - A piece of software that can be installed and hidden on the victim
computer without the user’s knowledge. It may be included in a larger software
package or installed by an attacker who has been able to take advantage of
vulnerability on the victim machine. Rootkits are not necessarily malicious, but
they may hide malicious activities. Attackers may be able to access information,
monitor user actions, modify programs, or perform other functions on the
targeted computer without being detected (See: http://www.uscert.gov/cas/tips/ST06-001.html).
Security Event and Information Management (SEIM) – Centralized collection
and management of security event records from many different systems such
as firewalls, IDS/IPS, antivirus software, authentication systems, etc. SEIMs
may provide complex multifactor rules to alert on patterns of behavior not easily
identifiable by one of the component systems alone.
Spearphishing – A targeted phishing attack against a select group of victims,
usually belonging to a single company, school, industry, etc. “Spearphishing” is
commonly used to refer to any targeted email attack, not limited to phishing.

Trojan horse - An apparently useful program containing hidden functions that can
exploit the privileges of the user (running the program), with a resulting security
threat. A Trojan horse does things that the program user did not intend. Trojan
horses rely on users to install them, or they can be installed by intruders who
have gained unauthorized access by other means. Then, an intruder
attempting to subvert a system using a Trojan horse relies on other users
running the Trojan horse to be successful (See: www.cert.org/advisories/CA1999-02.html).
Tunneling - A technique to encapsulate one communication data stream inside of
another, in order to extend the advantages of the latter to the former. Attackers
will often tunnel a network protocol that would not be allowed to cross network
boundaries inside of another that is allowed, defeating perimeter defenses
(See: http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/projects/devglossary/_tunneling.html).
Two-factor Authentication (T-FA) - Existing authentication methodologies involve
three basic “factors”:
• Something the user knows (e.g., password, PIN);
• Something the user has (e.g., ATM card, smart card); and
• Something the user is (e.g., biometric characteristic, such as a fingerprint).
T-FA requires that a user present two of the three possible factors to the
authentication mechanism. A known flaw in some T-FA systems is the server
storage of a hash representation of the credentials contained on the smart card
or token. With this in hand, the attacker can replay that data to the
authentication system; in this case, that of the proxy server, without needing the
physical card or token (See:
http://www.ffiec.gov/pdf/authentication_guidance.pdf).
USPACOM – United States Pacific Command is one of six Unified Combatant
Commands of the United States Armed Forces with an area of responsibility
encompassing all territory from the US West Coast to the western border of
India, and from Antarctica to the North Pole. The command presently has
approximately 325,000 US service personnel.
USTRANSCOM - United States Transportation Command provides intermodal
transportation across the spectrum of military operations. USTRANSCOM is
comprised of three component commands -- the Air Force's Air Mobility
Command, the Navy's Military Sealift Command, and the Army's Military
Surface Deployment and Distribution Command.
Zero day exploit – An attack against a software vulnerability that has not yet been
addressed by the software maintainers. These attacks are difficult to defend
