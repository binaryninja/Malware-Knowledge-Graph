In Q1 2021, threat actors conducted a series of attacks using the Cring
ransomware. These attacks were mentioned in a Swisscom CSIRT tweet, but it
remained unclear how the ransomware infects an organization’s network.
An incident investigation conducted by Kaspersky ICS CERT experts at one of
the attacked enterprises revealed that attacks of the Cring ransomware exploit
a vulnerability in FortiGate VPN servers.
Victims of these attacks include industrial enterprises in European countries. At
least in one case, an attack of the ransomware resulted in a temporary shutdown
of the industrial process due to servers used to control the industrial process
becoming encrypted.
In this paper, we discuss the results of our research and interesting aspects of
the attack.
It is worth noting that Fortinet has on several occasions warned users of its
devices of the danger posed by the vulnerability and a high risk of attacks,
including attacks by APT groups.

Initial attack vector
The attackers exploited the CVE-2018-13379 vulnerability in FortiGate VPN
servers to gain access to the enterprise’s network.
Unpatched FortiGate devices are vulnerable to a directory traversal attack,
which allows an attacker to access system files on the FortiGate SSL VPN
appliance. Specifically, an unauthenticated attacker can connect to the
appliance through the internet and remotely access the file
"sslvpn_websession", which contains the username and password used to
access VPN, stored in cleartext. The vulnerability affects devices that run
FortiOS versions 6.0.0 to 6.0.4, 5.6.3 to 5.6.7, and 5.4.6 to 5.4.12.
Several days before the start of the main attack phase, the attackers performed
test connections to the VPN Gateway, apparently in order to check that the
authentication credentials stolen in an attack on the VPN server could still be
used.
The attackers may have identified the vulnerable device themselves by scanning
IP addresses. Alternatively, they may have bought a ready-made list containing
IP addresses of vulnerable FortiGate VPN Gateway devices. In autumn 2020, an
offer to buy a database of such devices appeared on a dark web forum.

Lateral movement
After gaining access to the first system on the enterprise network, the
attackers downloaded the Mimikatz utility to that system. The utility was used to
steal the account credentials of Windows users who had previously logged in to
the compromised system.
With the help of the Mimikatz utility, the attackers were able to compromise the
domain administrator account, after which they started distributing malware to
other systems on the organization’s network. They used the Cobalt Strike
framework for that purpose. The Cobalt Strike module was loaded on attacked
systems using the PowerShell.

After launching, the malicious PowerShell script decrypted the payload – the
Cobalt Strike Beacon backdoor, which provided the attackers with remote
control of the infected system.
The IP address 198.12.112[.]204 was specified as the Cobalt Strike Beacon
command-and-control server.

Encryption
After gaining control of the infected system, the attackers downloaded a cmd
script to the machine. The script was designed to download and launch the
malware – the Cring ransomware.
The script was saved to the following path:
%TEMP%\execute.bat (e.g., C:\Windows\Temp\execute.bat).

Malicious cmd script

After being installed on the system, the cmd script named execute.bat was
executed. The script launched PowerShell under the name “kaspersky”. The
attackers used this technique to mask the traces of the malware activity and
disguise the operation of the malware as that of security solutions. A command
to download a file from the internet was passed to the running PowerShell shell.
The file’s URL was http://45.67.231[.]128/ip.txt. The downloaded file was saved as
C:\__output.
Although the file specified in the URL had the extension .txt, it was in fact the
executable file of the malware – the Cring ransomware. At the time of analyzing
the malware hosting server, the file ip.txt had already been removed, but the
attackers had uploaded a newer version of the Cring malware (the file NoNet.txt)
to the server.

To be able to encrypt database files and remove backup copies, the Cring
malware stoped the services of the following programs:
•
•

Veritas NetBackup: BMR Boot Service, NetBackup BMR MTFTP Service
Microsoft SQL server: SQLTELEMETRY, SQLTELEMETRY$ECWDB2,
SQLWriter

The SstpSvc service, which is used to create VPN connections, was also
stopped. It is most likely that the attackers, who at this stage controlled the
infected system via Cobalt Strike, did this to make it impossible to connect to
the infected system remotely via VPN. This was done to prevent system
administrators from providing a timely response to the information security
incident.
Additionally, the malware terminated the following applications’ processes in
order to encrypt files without hindrance:
•
•

Microsoft Office: mspub.exe
Oracle Database software: mydesktopqos.exe, mydesktopservice.exe

The malware removed backup files that had the following extensions: .VHD, .bac,
.bak, .wbcat, .bkf, .set, .win, and .dsk. It also removed files and folders located in
the root folder of the drive if their names started with the word “Backup”
or “backup”.
To perform these operations, the malware created a cmd script named kill.bat on
the drive, which deleted itself after execution.

Next, the malware started to encrypt files using strong encryption algorithms,
which means that files could not be decrypted without knowing the RSA private
key held by the attackers. Each file was encrypted using AES and the AES
encryption key was in turn encrypted using an RSA public key hard-coded into
the malicious program’s executable file. The RSA key size was 8,192 bits.
Files with the following extensions were encrypted:

Reconnaissance
Various details of the attack indicate that the attackers had carefully analyzed
the infrastructure of the attacked organization and prepared their own
infrastructure and toolset based on the information collected at the
reconnaissance stage.
For example, the malware hosting server (45.67.231[.]128) from which the Cring
ransomware was downloaded had filtration by IP address enabled and only
responded to requests from several European countries.
The attackers’ cmd scripts disguised the activity of the malware as the
operation of the antivirus solution (Kaspersky) used by the enterprise and
terminated the processes of database servers (Microsoft SQL Server) and
backup systems (Veeam) that were used on systems selected for encryption.
An analysis of the attackers’ activity demonstrates that, based on the results of
reconnaissance performed on the attacked organization’s network, they chose
to encrypt those servers the loss of which the attackers believed would cause
the greatest damage to the enterprise’s operations.

Causes of the incident
It is worth highlighting a number of reasons that contributed to the information
security incident investigated by the Kaspersky ICS CERT team or directly led to it.
1.

The primary causes of the incident include the use of an outdated and
vulnerable firmware version on the FortiGate VPN server (version 6.0.2
was used at the time of the attack), which enabled the attackers to
exploit the CVE-2018-13379 vulnerability and gain access to the
enterprise network.

2. The lack of timely antivirus database updates for the security solution
used on attacked systems also played a key role, preventing the solution
from detecting and blocking the threat. It should also be noted that some
components of the antivirus solution were disabled, further reducing the
quality of protection.
3. Other factors contributing to the incident’s development included the
user account privilege settings configured in domain policies and the
parameteres of RDP access.
There were no restrictions on access to different systems. In other
words, all users were allowed to access all systems. Such settings help

attackers to distribute malware on the enterprise network much more
quickly, since successfully compromising just one user account provides
them with access to numerous systems.

Attack workflow

Recommendations
1.

Keep the VPN Gateway firmware and endpoint security solutions
updated to the latest versions.

2. Keep antimalware databases updated to the latest versions.
3. Check that all components of endpoint security solutions are enabled.
4. Make sure that the Active Directory policy allows users to log in only to
those systems which are required by their operational needs.
5. Restrict network connections, specifically VPN connections, between
hosts on the industrial network, block connections on all ports that are
not required by the industrial process.
6. Configure the backup system to store backup copies on a dedicated
server.
7. To further enhance your organization’s resilience to possible ransomware
attacks, consider implementing Endpoint Detection and Response type
security solutions both on your IT and OT networks.

8. Adapting Managed Detection and Response services to get immediate
access to high-level security professionals’ knowledge and expertise may
also be a good idea.
9. Use dedicated protection for the industrial process. Kaspersky Industrial
CyberSecurity protects industrial endpoints and enables OT network
monitoring to identify and block malicious activity.
