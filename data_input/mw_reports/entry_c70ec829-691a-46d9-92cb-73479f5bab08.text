The FBI and CISA are issuing this PSA as a part of a series on threats to the 2020 election
to enable the American public to be prepared, patient, and participating voters.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency (CISA) are issuing this announcement to raise awareness of the potential threat
posed by foreign-backed online journals that spread disinformation regarding the 2020
elections. Foreign intelligence services have been known to use websites, including pseudoacademic online journals, to disseminate articles with misleading or unsubstantiated
information. Such sites could be employed during the 2020 election season in an attempt to
manipulate public opinion, increase societal divisions, cause widespread confusion, discredit
the electoral process, and undermine confidence in U.S. democratic institutions.
Foreign intelligence services have used online journals, including some with a global reach,
to exacerbate disunity and dysfunction in the United States while also misinforming or
misleading readers. Foreign governments have used these journals to amplify their
disinformation and overt propaganda, and they have used websites, social media, and other
online platforms to amplify the journals' messages and increase their global reach.

As foreign actors intensify their efforts to influence the outcome of the 2020 U.S. elections,
they could use online journals to advance and launder misinformation and disinformation to
denigrate or support specific candidates or political parties. Foreign actors could also use
online journals to target the U.S. elections by making claims of voter suppression, amplifying
reports of real or alleged cyberattacks on election infrastructure, asserting voter or ballot
fraud, and spreading other information intended to convince the public of the elections'
illegitimacy.
Recommendations

Seek out information from trustworthy sources, verify who produced the content, and
consider their intent.
Rely on state and local election officials as the authoritative sources of information
about how elections are conducted in their jurisdictions.
Verify through multiple reliable sources any reports about problems in voting or election
results, and consider searching for other reliable sources before sharing such
information via social media or other avenues.
Report potential election crimes—such as disinformation about the manner, time, or
place of voting—to the FBI.
If appropriate, make use of in-platform tools offered by social media companies for
reporting suspicious posts that appear to be spreading false or inconsistent information
about election-related problems or results.
The FBI and CISA urge the American public to critically evaluate the sources of the
information they consume and to seek out reliable and verified information. The FBI is
responsible for investigating malign foreign influence operations and malicious cyber activity
targeting election infrastructure and other U.S. democratic institutions. CISA is responsible
for protecting the nation's critical infrastructure from physical and cyber threats. The FBI and
CISA provide services and information to uphold the security, integrity, and resiliency of the
U.S. electoral processes.
Victim Reporting and Additional Information

The FBI encourages the public to report information concerning suspicious or criminal
activity to their local field office (www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices) or to the FBI's Internet
Crime Complaint Center (www.ic3.gov). For additional assistance, best practices, and
