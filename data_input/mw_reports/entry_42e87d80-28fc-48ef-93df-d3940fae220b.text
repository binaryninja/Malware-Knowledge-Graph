Every single day our teams analyze the trillions of signals we see to understand attack
vectors, and then take those learnings and apply them to our products and solutions. Having
that understanding of the threat landscape is key to ensuring our customers are kept safe
every day. However, being a security provider in a complex world sometimes requires deeper
thinking and reflection on how to address emerging issues, especially when the answer is
not always immediately clear. Our approach to domain fronting within Azure is a great
example of how the ever-changing dynamics of our world have prompted us to re-examine
an important and complicated issue—and ultimately make a change.
Let’s start with some background. Domain fronting is a networking technique that enables a
backend domain to utilize the security credentials of a fronting domain. For example, if you
have two domains under the same content delivery network (CDN), domain #1 may have
certain restrictions placed on it (regional access limitations, etc.) that domain #2 does not. By
taking the valid domain #2 and placing it into the SNI header, and then using domain #1 in
the HTTP header, it’s possible to circumvent those restrictions. To the outside observer, all

subsequent traffic appears to be headed to the fronting domain, with no ability to discern the
intended destination for particular user requests within that traffic. It is possible that the
fronting domain and the backend domain do not belong to the same owner.
As a company that is committed to delivering technology for good, supporting certain use
cases that support free and open communication are an important consideration when
weighing the potential impacts of a technique like domain fronting. However, we know that
domain fronting is also abused by bad actors and threat actors engaging in illegal activities,
and we’ve become aware that in some cases bad actors configure their Azure services to
enable this.
When it comes to situations like this, Microsoft—as a security company—leads from a place
of providing greater simplicity for our customers when they face increased complexity. Our
mission is to give our customers peace of mind and help them adapt quickly to a rapidly
shifting threat landscape. Therefore, we’re making a change to our policy to ensure that
domain fronting will be stopped and prevented within Azure.
Changes like this one are not made lightly, and we understand that there will be impacts
across a number of areas:
Our engineering teams are already working to ensure the platform will block anyone
from practicing the domain fronting technique on Azure, while also continuing to ensure
our products and services provide the highest levels of protection against domain
fronting based threats.
We’re continuing to provide clear guidance for penetration testing on our Azure
properties, and working closely with security researchers around the world to make
sure they have a clear understanding of these changes.
These changes are just another example of the broad impact that security has on our everchanging world and we’ll continue to put the security of our customers and their users at the
forefront of everything we do. I’d like to thank my colleagues Nick Carr and Christopher Glyer
for their tireless research on Domain Fronting, which helped us to make these policy
changes to Azure.
