The recent widespread SolarWinds/SUNBURST hack and IronNet’s initial detection of
associated behaviors on May 31, 2020, highlights the need for companies, industries, and
governments to work together to identify potential large-scale cyber threat activity and to
take coordinated action.
Today, most companies and government agencies focus on defending themselves against
potential threats, consuming huge amounts of internal resources and only sharing
information sporadically with others through traditional means, including email lists and
message boards.
This approach is likely to fail every time.

SolarWinds/SUNBURST: Behavioral analytics and Collective Defense in action

Why? Because individual organizations continue to battle highly capable — and highly
coordinated — cyber threat actors , including nation-state and advanced criminal groups.
The most effective way for private industry and individual government agencies to stand a
chance against such threats, is to work together.
Organizations first need behavioral analytics that constantly look deep into individual
networks and hunt for threats as they enter the network, as well as during successive stages
of the attack. With those insights we can create a Collective Defense network, where
individual companies share anonymized threat information in real-time and collaborate to
triage and stop potential threats. This Collective Defense approach allows defenders to
function on par with the attacker: hunting and fighting as a team, through knowledge
sharing, crowdsourcing, and collaborative action.

Background
Cyber attacks are growing in frequency and intensity. On December 13th, news broke of a
widespread network intrusions based on a software supply chain compromise of IT service
provider SolarWinds. Quickly underscoring the severity of this breach, the U.S. Cybersecurity
and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
released alerts, and researchers at FireEye published technical details indicating that the
software supply chain compromise occurred earlier and resulted in a trojanized version of
SolarWinds’ Orion remote management software. This version, which FireEye dubbed
SUNBURST, was distributed to SolarWinds customers between March and June.
Media reporting has attributed these compromises to threat actors associated with Russian
intelligence services. This follows previous reporting attributing the FireEye breach to APT29
(aka Cozy Bear), a threat actor linked to Russia’s SVR intelligence service. Media reporting
indicates these threat actors were able to penetrate deep into networks for many months and
were able to obtain administrative rights as well as establish legitimate-appearing credentials
and points of entry. Given the scale and scope of these adversary activities, it is critical that
we take action now to limit further incidents.
The adversary will continue to modify their techniques...Their goal is to hide in the noise of
normal network activities, which is why being able to detect behaviors and collaborate broadly
in real time is so critical.

SUNBURST tactics, techniques, and procedures
The threat actor used several sophisticated techniques to hide command and control traffic,
such as mimicking SolarWinds’ Orion traffic and leveraging infrastructure providers to
masquerade as trusted geolocated environments.

SolarWinds/SUNBURST: Behavioral analytics and Collective Defense in action

While one of the distinctive network behaviors associated with SUNBURST that has been
discussed by the cybersecurity community is command and control (C2) using Domain
Generation Algorithm (DGA), it is our perspective at IronNet that this behavior more closely
aligns with DNS tunneling. In fact, our initial detections of the SUNBURST C2 domain in
early Summer 2020 were based upon our DNS tunneling analytic.
More than 18,000 SolarWinds customers downloaded the update that had the SUNBURST
backdoor and were exposed. The actor then chose a much smaller set of companies and
government agencies they wanted to exploit and downloaded a second set of tools and
compromised those networks.

How IronNet detected — and correlated — SUNBURST
On May 31, 2020, using the DNS tunneling analytic within IronDefense, IronNet’s network
detection and response solution, we first detected the initial SUNBURST behavior in nearreal-time on a customer’s network.
Upon detection, an alert was automatically shared into the customer’s IronDefense instance
and into IronDome, our Collective Defense platform, where the same behavior was
subsequently detected and correlated across four customer environments spread over six
months. While the significance of these alerts did not rise to an actionable level, providing
our customers the ability to identify this unusual behavior propagating across multiple
organizations enables them to collaborate in real time and significantly increase their ability
to identify and stop the threat before it spreads. Moreover, based on our analysis and
continued assessment, none of our customer networks were compromised by the second
stage deployments of SolarWinds. It is our assessment that if such an attempt had been
made, it likely would have been detected and actionable.

We know that in the future, the adversary will continue to modify their advanced techniques
in an attempt to hide their access operations, elevate privileges, move laterally, steal data,
and potentially take more aggressive action to modify or delete information. As in this case,
their goal is to hide in the noise of normal network activities, which is why being able to
detect behaviors and collaborate broadly in real time is so critical.
This is why IronNet was founded: We use advanced behavioral analytics and machine
learning techniques to find suspicious behaviors and leverage our game-changing collective
defense capability to crowdsource knowledge from our customers to help them identify new
and novel threats. This allows our clients to see things others might miss, as well as to find
threat actors who’ve already gotten in and are trying to hide.
Had a large percentage of those exposed to SolarWinds detected the behavior and been
sharing information about this potential threat and collaborating on it in realtime, it is
significantly more likely that the campaign would have been recognized early on.

The Call to Action
More than 18,000 companies were exposed to the SolarWinds hack. Each of those
companies worked individually to protect their networks. Imagine if the security analysts for
those 18,000 companies had been working together at network speed and sharing
crowdsourced knowledge, leveraging their collective expertise to defend themselves, their
industries, and the nation.

Now is the time to make this paradigm shift from defending in isolation to Collective
Defense. In order to truly create a real-time defensive capability, we must leverage:
Behavioral analytics to detect anomalies that are invisible to signature-based systems.
An expert system to help us deal with false positives and work at speed.
A flexible hunt platform for analysts to find nation state actors early on.
A machine learning engine that correlates events across organizations and industries.
For example:
Companies from specific industries or sectors;
Cross-industry collaborations, such as critical infrastructure providers;
Federal government organizations from different departments and agencies; and
Collaboration across the public and private sectors to address broad campaigns
like this one.
Sharing anonymized threat information, as appropriate, with the government to
empower our national defense.
This will enable us to build the real-time radar picture of cyberspace that will allow the
government and industry to work together to defend their own companies, their sectors, and
the nation. This is the IronNet vision.

What IronNet customers are saying
At IronNet, we remain highly engaged with our customers as the SolarWinds/SUNBURST
hack continues to unfold. This engagement goes beyond the real-time sharing and
collaboration enabled by our IronDefense solution and the IronDome platform. From our
executive leadership and security operations center, to our customer success team, IronNet is
working closely, on a daily basis, with our customers to get them the latest on discussions
taking place at the local, state, national, and international level, and gathering their feedback
