rickBot Banker Insights

by ASERT Team on October 25th, 2016
A new banking trojan, TrickBot, has seemingly risen from the ashes left behind by the
November 2015 takedown of Dyreza/Dyre infrastructure and the arrests of threat actors
identified by Russian authorities. Dyreza was used to target customers of over 1000
U.S. and U.K. banks and other companies during the peak of operations. Researchers at
Threat Geek and MalwareBytes have already extensively covered general TrickBot
functionality.
During ASERT’s research, we uncovered a few new peculiarities as yet to be discussed,
including links to Godzilla Loader and the ability to download and execute additional malware
packages.
First, when analyzing malware sample (all samples listed
by MD5 hash) 3a55fd6b3f969b1324a1942af08e039e, we discovered links back to the
somewhat new Godzilla Loader.
In this case, Godzilla Loader (fc431f69760c598098f34eec337c8415) was used to install
TrickBot from http://185.14.29[.]13/api.php. The login panel for the Command & Control (C2)
server appears at the URL admin.php as follows:

Additional research on Virus Total shows this particular instance to be part of a spam
campaign. Threat actors laced an email message with a malicious .scr executable that
installed Godzilla Loader. The loader was used to subsequently download TrickBot. The
message appears as such:
Subject: You have received a new fax
Attach: fax198-203-9153.scr
Interestingly enough, Godzilla Loader was used as the intermediary for both Bolek and
Panda Bankers when threat actors first started distributing them. More information on
Godzilla Loader functionality can be found here. T
rickBot’s Download and Execute Command
As referenced in the malware analyses above, TrickBot has a number of commands that use
slightly different URLs. For its “download and execute” functionality, TrickBot uses the
following path template: /%s/%s/1/%s/ A completed URL looks something like:

hXXps://138[.]201[.]44[.]28/tmt2/ADMINPC_W617601.F2F368CFEBB3F08115DB04EE5697EBBC/1/
PB1qOLElSsGUg45wH3JyIKEMGzl60MB/
This path can be broken down into the following pieces:
“gtag” – group tag
Client ID
Command number
16 to 32 random letters and digits
The response from the C2 server will look similar to:

The response can be split into three pieces using “\r\n” as a delimiter. The first piece is a “/”
delimited header which echoes back a couple of the request pieces along with a few
additional items: /42/tmt2/ADMINPC_W617601.23BD67ECD8AEDEC8FEAE8253B2C09D03/
XbuepYhfjAwVBawBh1PvDHyHKZmB49/41268/ At the end is a trailer which seems to
always be “1234567890”. In the middle is base64-encoded data. Decoding this base64 data
results in the following type of output:

This is a binary structure that can be broken up into the following pieces:
Unknown DWORD
4/6

32-byte SHA256 digest
URL length (DWORD)
URL (Unicode)
Signature (Remaining bytes)
hXXp://15616[.]merahost[.]ru/851321365.bin Which links to a Pony Loader variant known as
“Fox Stealer”. In this case, the Pony Loader variant was utilizing 85.132.136[.]5 as the C2.
The admin panel login on this site is seen below. There is not enough evidence to conclude if
threat actors behind TrickBot are using Pony Loader or are simply enabling access for
additional threat actors.

Conclusion
ASERT analysts have taken a look at additional functionality and links between TrickBot and
additional threats. Reports have suggested a mix of campaign methodologies were used to
initially distribute TrickBot, including use of Rig Exploit Kit and malicious spam delivery. In
general, if the threat actors are associated with former Dyreza activities, they have not
reinvigorated the overall breadth of targeting observed within the original Dyreza campaigns.
Threat actors limited initial exposure and breadth, targeting a small amount of Australian
banks. Regardless, time will tell if these actors decide to match the overall expanse of
Dyreza or limit their operations in hopes of staving off additional police interactions.
