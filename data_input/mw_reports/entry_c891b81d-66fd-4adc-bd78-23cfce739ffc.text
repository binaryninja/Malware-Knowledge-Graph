Last year, a major RCE was found in GitLab, CVE-2021-22205, where GitLab versions >=
11.9 and <13.10.3 were affected due to improper image validation before passing it to a file
parser.

Malicious image
The DjVu image is considered a legacy format, so not much attention has been paid to it.
The GitLab RCE depends on a vulnerability in ExifTool, CVE-2021-22204, where improper
parsing of annotations, including a dangerous eval to add quotes to a string, caused an
RCE. A patch was created on the 13th April 2021 in this commit.

Loader script
Temporary memory file system
The script clears the temporary memory file system and creates the folder
/dev/shm/kthzabor , which is an attempt to prevent the kthzabor mining malware from
working.

Process killing
Hardcoded list
Many processes are attempted to be killed, such as databases, miners, various other
malware, task managers and both defensive and offensive security tools.
1/5

PBot
pbotbyjanhotzu is likely a competing malware, but it doesn’t appear to have been

reported on.

Network server killing

Any processes listening on ports associated with mining malware are also killed.
Mining malware killing

Processes with names possibly linked to mining malware such as sysrv-hello are killed.
Mining processes are often very simply, where a regular script is executed with the pool ip
address as an argument, so these are also killed.
Payload execution

Finally a perl script is fetched and executed.

Payload
2/5

The payload itself appears to be called “Stealth Shellbot”, which appears to have been in use
since at least the 23rd Nov 2015. It appears to be adapted from “ShellBOT”, found on github.
The authors may be Portuguese.

Connection
The bot connects to an IRC server and joins a channel.
