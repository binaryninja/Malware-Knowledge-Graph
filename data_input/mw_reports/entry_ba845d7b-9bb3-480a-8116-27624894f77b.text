The NetWalker ransomware has been one of the most notorious ransomware families over the
course of the past year, targeting organizations in the US and Europe including several
healthcare organizations, despite several known threat actors publicly claiming to abstain from
targeting such organizations due to COVID-19.

Key Findings
Worldwide Threat: NetWalker was employed in attacks across a variety of industries around
the world, which caused great damage to many organizations.
Encrypting Mapped Drives: NetWalker encrypts shared network drives of adjacent machines
on the network.
Double Extortion Operations: The threat actor behind NetWalker threatens to publicly reveal
stolen data if payments are not made.
High Severity: The Cybereason Nocturnus Team assesses the threat level as HIGH given the
destructive potential of the attacks.
Detected and Prevented: The Cybereason Defense Platform fully detects and prevents the
NetWalker ransomware.

Cybereason Blocks NetWalker Ransomware
NetWalker ransomware first surfaced in August of 2019 (first dubbed Mailto). The group behind
NetWalker operates a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) business model, which means they
provide their infrastructure, tools and support in exchange for affiliate payment.
NetWalker operators have adopted the recent popular trend among ransomware
purveyors:double extortion. In addition to demanding a ransom for the encrypted files, the group
behind NetWalker steals sensitive data and files from its victims. The group extorts the victims
by threatening to leak the stolen data unless ransom is paid. This technique renders the practice
of data backups all but moot in combating the impact from ransomware attacks. Other known
ransomware groups that leverage the double extortion paradigm are Maze, REvil, and
DoppelPaymer.
The group behind NetWalker also maintains a blog on the Darknet where the group publishes
information about its new victims alongside a countdown to the deadline for the ransom to be
paid. If the time limit has expired and no ransom has been paid, the stolen data is published to
this blog:

Netwalker Blog
The targets of NetWalker belong to various sectors, among them educational facilities, local
government, healthcare providers, and private companies. In June of 2020, three US
universities were targeted with the ransomware: the University of California San Francisco,
Michigan State University, and Columbia College of Chicago.
Different government facilities were victims of NetWalker in Austria and Argentina in the past
year as well. The attackers behind NetWalker do not pass on healthcare facilities as well - it has
been reported that NetWalker has attacked Wilmington Surgical Associates and 13GB of data
was stolen. Other healthcare facilities have been targeted as well, among them CrozerKeystone Health System.
Other companies that fell victim include NameSouth, a US-based auto parts distributor, KElectric, an electricity provider in Pakistan, and Toll Group Deliveries, an Australian
transportation and logistics company.

Infection
The NetWalker ransomware has operators have been observed to using several different
methods to infect an organization, these including the abuse of COVID-19 topics for phishing
mails, weak credentials for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), exposed web applications and
unpatched VPNs. According to a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Flash Alert, “two of the
most common vulnerabilities exploited by actors using NetWalker are Pulse Secure VPN (CVE2019-11510) and Telerik UI (CVE-2019-18935).”
For example, Cybereason observed an attack that started with a VBS file was attached to a
phishing email with a COVID-19 lure content:

Upon execution, the script will drop the ransomware to “%temp%” and execute NetWalker:

In other cases, the ransomware was deployed following an interactive hacking operation using a
ported-version of the ransomware payload that was injected to explorer.exe by a PowerShell
script:

Ransomware Analysis
4/12

As a means of evasion, NetWalker does not directly declare its Windows API imported function
in the import table. Instead, the ransomware dynamically resolves all of its API as a technique
used to make static analysis harder. NetWalker compares a CRC32 hashed value of an API
name to the exports of specific modules, then it builds a struct that holds the address of
NetWalker’s API:

NetWalker dynamically loads API
After resolving the needed API, NetWalker loads the ransomware configuration. The
configuration is saved in the ransomware resources and is RC4 encrypted:

NetWalker Configuration Data
Before encrypting the victim's files, NetWalker deletes the Windows' Shadow Copies using the
vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet command. On some variants, the command is spawned
by the executable of the ransomware; on others, it is spawned by the PowerShell script which
executes NetWalker:

Next, the ransomware will start the encryption stage. NetWalker ransomware checks for valid
drives in the system using GetLogicalDriveStringsW. For network drives, the ransomware uses
ImpersonateLoggedOnUser in an attempt to impersonate the context of the current user in order
to access the remote drive. NetWalker then encrypts the files on the network and local drive
using Salsa20 encryption. After the files are encrypted, the ransom note is placed.
On some variants, NetWalker also creates persistence via the run registry key and drops a copy
of the ransomware to C:\Program
Files\random_generated_name\random_generated_name.exe’ or ‘C:\Program Files
(x86)\random_generated_name\random_generated_name.exe’.

CYBEREASON DETECTION AND PREVENTION
The Cybereason Defense Platform is able to prevent the execution of NetWalker Ransomware
using multi-layer prevention that detects and blocks malware with threat intelligence, machine
learning, and Next-Gen AV (NGAV) capabilities. Additionally, when the Anti-Ransomware feature
is enabled, behavioral detection techniques in the platform are able to detect and prevent any
attempt to encrypt files and generates a MalopTM:

Additionally, using Cybereason’s PowerShell protection feature, Cybereason is able to detect
and prevent the initial PowerShell infection stage of NetWalker:
