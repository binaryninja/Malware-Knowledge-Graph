APT Group Targets Indian Defense Officials Through
Enhanced TTPs
During our routine threat hunting exercise, Cyble Research Labs came across a malware sample posted on Twitter by a
researcher who believes that the malware belongs to Transparent Tribe, an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Group.
Given the nature of the victim and the way they are targeted, we can draw some similarities to the Side Copy APT group.
Both APT groups are known to have mainly targeted India’s Defense and Government sectors in the past. Additionally, both
groups have used various other RAT and malware to launch campaigns via multiple modes such as phishing, delivering
payload via mail, etc. The malware posted by the researcher on Twitter has used a technique to hide the actual malware in
the .vhdx file to avoid any antivirus detection. As per Wikipedia, .vhdx is the successor of VHD (Virtual Hard Disk).
The figure below shows the high-level execution flow of the malware. Upon execution, the malware checks for the current
time zone. If it is able to verify that the victim system’s time zone is in IST, it connects to the attacker’s URL for downloading
the second stager. Once downloaded, it executes the second stager payload and deletes itself.
The second stager payload checks that only one instance of the malware is running, and then it connects with the attacker’s
Command and Control (C&C) server to start receiving the commands from Threat Actor (TA).

Technical Analysis
Cyble Research started analysis with the malware file name AFD CSD APP.vhdx; the sample had an extension. vhdx. After
double-clicking on the AFD CSD APP.vhdx we observed it creating a mount in the Operating System (OS) with the name
“CSD App“. After opening the mounted drive, we got the malicious malware file which is CSD_AppLaunch.exe.

Figure 2 Actual Malware present in CSD APP Mount
While performing a static analysis of the CSD_AppLaunch.exe malicious file, we determined that that the file is an x86
architecture Windows-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) Application written in .NET Language shown in the figure

below.

Figure 3 Static Details of First Stager
The icon of the malicious app had the logo of the Canteen Store Department (CSD) of the Indian Armed Forces, as shown
in the figure below.

Figure 4 Application Logo Used for First Stager

Code Analysis (CSD_AppLaunch.exe)
As per the below code, once the malware has been executed, it checks whether the current OS time Zone is India Standard
Time (IST); if the OS time is not in IST, the malware exits. This tells us that the malware has been created with the explicit
purpose of targeting the Indian Defense establishment and service members.

Figure 5 Malware Checks for Time Zone

Initially, the code shown below figure uses the .NET WebBrowser() class to open the URL h[tt]ps:[//]afd.csdindia[.]gov[.]in
and load the Form1_Load module to execute the malicious malware code.

Figure 6 Malware Loading Indian CSD Website in Custom Browser and Execute Form1_Load
Once the Form1_Load method is called, the code shown in Figure 7 creates a directory in C:\\ProgramData as “Intel Wifi*”.*
If this directory is not present, it will be created, Once the directory is present, the malware proceeds to download the next
stager payload from URL https[:]//secure256[.]net/ver4.mp3. Then, the malware decrypts the ver4.mp3 content to create
IntelWifi.exe malicious binary in C:\\ProgramData\\Intel Wifi as shown in the code below.

Figure 7 Create Folder in ProgramData and Download Second Stager
The code below contains the decryption logic used by the malware to decrypt the content of ver4.mp3 file.

Figure 8 Decrypt Second Stager
Finally, the first stager malware calls the Final method to create a new file name music.mp3 which contains the decrypted
data of ver4.mp3 in the C:\\ProgramData directory.
After this step, it sleeps for 6 seconds and then uses the Move function to rename the music.mp3 file to IntelWifi.exe. It then
sleeps for five more seconds and then executes IntelWifi.exe binary and delete CSD_AppLaunch.exe (first stager) binary as
shown in the figure below.

Figure 9 Create Second Stager Binary IntelWifi.exe

Technical Analysis for IntelWifi.exe (Second Stager)
Static analysis of IntelWifi.exe tells that the binary is an x86 architecture Windows-based Graphical User Interface (GUI)
application written in .NET language as shown in the figure below.

Figure 10 Static Details of IntelWifi (Second Stager)
As per the below code, initially, the malware checks that only a single instance of a malware process is running. Then, it
checks whether the current time zone is India Standard Time. Further, it calls CheckDirectory() method to create \\Intel Wifi
directory and vmnx.dll file. Finally, it calls the Form1 module to execute the malicious codes.

Figure 11 Second Stager Malware Performing Various Checks
Form1() module calls IntializeComponent method, which in turn loads the Form1_Load method. The Form1_Load then calls
Run() method to start the malware activity as shown in the figure below.

Figure 12 Execution Flow to Initiate the Malicious Activity
The Run code is shown in Figure 13. Once executed, it connects to the attacker’s C&C on address
45[.]147[.]228[.]195[:]5434. After establishing contact with the C&C server, it calls the Run method from the Grabber class to
execute a series of methods to get the victim’s environment details, e.g., OS, current username, etc. Once the victim’s
environment details are extracted, the malware sends the details to the attacker’s C&C with key “x999” and then waits for
commands to be received from the attacker.

Figure 13 Malware Communicating to Attacker’s C&C and Waiting to receive the Command
Below we have listed a series of methods executed by the Run() method present in the Grabber class.

Figure 14 Series of Methods Executed by Malware

Methods

Description

CreateID()

random number and write the ID is vmvcx.dll file. E.g., PXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX

Table 1 Methods Description Which Malware invokes
The below figure shows that the cynetcloud shortcut file is created in the startup folder using CreateNonStop() method. The
value file:///C:\ProgramData\Intel Wifi\IntelWifi.exe executes whenever the Windows machine starts. This is done for the
purpose of creating and maintaining persistence on the victim machine.

Figure 15 Malware Created Persistent in Start-Up Folder
Once all the methods are executed, as shown in Table 1, the malware sends the user data to Attacker’s C&C. In the figure
below, the malware has connected to our fake emulated C&C.

Figure 16 Malware Connected to Fake C&C
Once connected, the malware sends the victim’s environment details. The malware goes into a dormant stage to get the
next command from the attacker’s C&C.
For example, in the below figure, we have sent “prc1” to the malware to get the process details of the victim.

Figure 17 Output Received from malware
Below is the code used by the malware to handle the commands received from C&C.

Conclusion
The APT groups are evolving their tools and techniques to stay ahead of various security solutions like AV & EDR. Based
on the fact that this malware has multiple artifacts such as the logo, the URL used in the initial code, we can conclude that
the malware has been created specifically to target Indian Defense or Government officials.
Cyble Research Labs will continuously monitor security threats, whether they are ongoing or emerging. We will continue to
update our readers with our latest findings.
