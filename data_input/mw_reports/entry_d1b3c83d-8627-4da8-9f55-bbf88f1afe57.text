Operation Layover: How we tracked an attack on the
aviation industry to five years of compromise
blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/09/operation-layover-how-we-tracked-attack.html

By Tiago Pereira and Vitor Ventura.
Cisco Talos linked the recent aviation targeting campaigns to an actor who has been
targeting the aviation industry for two years.
The same actor has been running successful malware campaigns for more than five
years.
Although always using commodity malware, the acquisition of crypters to wrap the
malware makes them more effective.
This shows that a small operation can run for years under the radar, while still causing
serious problems for its targets.

Summary
Cisco Talos and other security researchers have recently reported on a series of malicious

1/27

campaigns targeting the aviation industry. These reports mainly center around the crypter
that hides the usage of commodity malicious remote access tools.
We decided this would be a good starting point to demonstrate how a researcher can pivot
from the initial discovery of a RAT and eventually profile a threat actor. This post will show
how we discovered previous campaigns targeting the aviation industry, which links back to
an actor that's been active for approximately six years.
We believe the actor is based out of Nigeria with a high degree of confidence and doesn't
seem to be technically sophisticated, using off-the-shelf malware since the beginning of its
activities without developing its own malware. The actor also buys the crypters that allow the
usage of such malware without being detected, throughout the years it has used several
different cryptors, mostly bought on online forums.
We also believe with a high degree of confidence that the actor has been active for at least
five years. For the last two, they've been targeting the aviation industry, while conducting
other campaigns at the same time. Pivoting from an initial discovery is not an exact science
— in this process, a researcher must assert a certain level of confidence in these
associations.
In this post, we will show how our research uncovered information about the attackers
spreading AsyncRAT and njRAT using specific lure documents centered around the aviation
industry. If infected with these threats, organizations could fall victim to data theft, financial
fraud or future cyber attacks with much worse consequences.
In the end, our research shows that actors that perform smaller attacks can keep doing them
for a long period of time under the radar. However, their activities can lead to major incidents
at large organizations. These are the actors that feed the underground market of credentials
and cookies, which can then be used by larger groups on activities like "big game hunting."

The aviation campaign
We started our research into these campaigns after a tweet from Microsoft describing new
attacks they discovered using AsyncRAT. Our researchers looked at the domain Microsoft
Security Intelligence mentioned, kimjoy[.]ddns[.]net. The image below shows the several
links we uncovered between the campaigns, domains, IPs and actors somehow associated
with each other.

2/27

This shows us that the actor behind these campaigns has been operating malware for more
than five years and specifically targeting the aviation industry for at least two years. For this
campaign, the actor used emails similar to the one below as the initial attack vector.

These emails would appear to contain an attached PDF file that was a link to a .vbs file
hosted on Google Drive.

3/27

Our research shows that this actor has been targeting the aviation industry since at least
2018, with files mentioning both "Trip Itinerary Details" and "Bombardier" at the time using
the URL akconsult[.]linkpc[.]net.

akconsult[.]linkpc[.]net
We first reached this domain by searching for the string "Charter details.vbs," which is the
name of one of the samples linked to the kimjoy[.]ddns[.]net domain.
The domain akconsult.linkpc.net is the oldest domain, first seen on July 2, 2015. Analysis of
the activity associated with the domain reveals that this actor has used several RATs and
that, since August 2018, there are samples communicating with this domain with names that
indicate the adversary wanted to target the aviation industry.
The following table shows a timeline of samples with aviation-related names that
communicate with akconsult[.]linkpc[.]net. It is worth noting that these are not the only files
related to this domain — they are just the ones relevant to our investigation.

4/27

This actor has been active for so long we wanted to know what else we could find about
them. So we started a search using the "akconsult" keyword. This search revealed a
malware sample and a user handle mentioned on the site hackingforum[.]net. A search on
this forum turned up several indicators of the actor's goals, which we will detail in the
following sections.
The sample identified was first seen on Feb. 7, 2013 and was packed with a .NET packer
that performs a triple reflection of the RunPE stub, before hollowing a copy of itself to inject
the CyberGate malware.

5/27

One of the Cybergate RAT's configuration parameters is the NewIdentification, as can be
seen on the registry key on the image above. We found a sample that uses Akconsult as an
identification key. This parameter is defined by the malware builder so that it can distinguish
between several operators. In this case, the operator used the handle "Akconsult," giving us
a good link to our actor. At this point, we know our actor uses akconsult as a username, so it
wouldn't be unusual for them to use it in a sample.
The command and control (C2) domain used by this sample is "opybiddo.zapto.org," which is
mentioned in the court case "Microsoft Corporation v. Mutairi et al." In this case, Microsoft
made a complaint against the creators of njWorm and the H-worm and VitalWerks, along
with the owner of the domain zapto.org. A deeper look into the case indicates that there was
no relation between AKconsult and the worm creators. At first glance, it seems that the
domain was seized along with others based solely on the fact that it was distributing malware
and belonged to VitalWerks. Eventually, we would come to find that there is another link
between our actor and these worms, which further strengthens the association between the
threat actor and this case.
This seizure predates the first record we have for the akconsult[.]linkpc[.]net domain, and
may have been the reason behind the creation of akconsult at linkpc[.].net
Using this hostname as a C2, we identified four other samples all using the same malware
but with different identifiers between September 2012 and May 2014.
During the recent campaigns, this domain was being used as a C2 for AsyncRAT, which the
attackers dropped via a VBS file hosted on Google Drive. This server was using TLS to
encrypt the C2 communications, so we decided to search for other servers using the same
certificate thumbprint.
This search shows AsyncRAT clients communicating with the same server that was used on
these campaigns. This expanded our sample scope to more than 50 samples. The analysis
of these samples uncovered the existence of eight more domains linked to this campaign
listed below.

6/27

Most of the domains were first seen either in May or June 2021. The oldest of the list
seemed to be active only for a couple of days, without many samples using it. However, the
URL e29rava[.]ddns[.]net was always active with several samples using it as C2.

e29rava[.]ddns[.]net
We analyzed several of these domains between early June and late July. Eventually, we
found that the domain e29rava[.]ddns[.]net is linked to at least 14 visual basic scripting (VBS)
files with names that are clearly linked to the aviation industry, as can be seen below.

7/27

This domain was almost exclusively used in this campaign, some of the file names are used
pointing to other domains on the previous list around the same day.
These VBS files are a crypter that is wrapping the AsyncRAT, as previously mentioned.

Other domains
Following the same breadcrumbs, we found other domains strongly linked to the same threat
actor that were not related with the aviation-themed campaigns.

Hostname bodmas[.]linkpc[.]net
We discovered this domain because "bodmas" is one of the usernames the threat actors use
for the Aspire crypter. A quick search for samples associated with it showed samples that
were active in the last quarter of 2018. As the picture below shows, in December 2018,
Nassief had already purchased the crypter.

8/27

One of the samples we found establishes yet another link to the hostname
kimjoy[.]ddns[.]net, which was one of the original domains reportedly linked to the aviation
campaigns. One sample contains the path for the PDB file shown below.

This path shows that it is using the Aspire crypter but also shows the "kimjoy" handle in a
sample that contacts the bodmas[.]linkpc[.]net domain, establishing another link between the
two. This seems to be some internal handle used by Aspire at build time.
The crypter was used to wrap CyberGate malware, the same we saw on the previous
domain.

Hostname groups[.]us[.]to
Sometimes during our investigations we are confronted with weak links, links that although
technically they make sense, due to the lack of additional supporting links or because they
don't fully fit the context, making us define them as low-confidence links — this is one of
those examples.
While the aviation campaign was active, there was one domain that, although it didn't seem
related at first, there was an overlap between IP addresses, as shown below.

9/27

At this point, we decided that it would be worth taking a deeper look at this hostname, one
the actor doesn't use very often.
The oldest malware sample referring to this hostname was first seen on Sept. 24, 2016 and
was a simple batch file that is part of a malware chain that drops multiple files. The batch file
will download and execute another malware, obfuscated with a Delphi packer.
Talos found what seemed like tests to determine the detection ratio of the malware using this
domain as a C2. The table below shows the submissions done with the same IP address
from the Dominican Republic, a single time, indicating that tests were being performed.

10/27

We decided to take a deeper look at these samples since they were being tested for
detection.

Convoluted njRAT
When we started the analysis on the Microsoft Publisher files and, given the previous TTPs
from this actor, we were not expecting the number of layers in the infection chain.

The Publisher files all had the same origins. We found the initial macros for testing and then
another version that, for the untrained eye, would seem like a perfectly normal macro.

11/27

In both cases, the macro extracts data from the Microsoft Form object embedded in the
malicious document.

This macro downloads an HTML document from the C2 and uses the mshta, as can be seen
on the image above on the right. The second stage is an HTML page that contains a
VBScript that the mshta executes. This code contains a PowerShell script which, after
deobfuscation, looks like the image below.

This script will ping us.cnn.com as an internet connection test and, afterward, it will proceed
to download the third stage from the GitHub page hxxps://satlahlk[.]github[.]io/msc/cl.png,
this other stage is PowerShell, encoded byte per byte.
This PowerShell contains three different .NET-compressed assemblies that are also charencoded. The first assembly patches the AMSI to prevent malware detection. This is a
variation code published on GitHub, as can be seen by the bytes contained on the byte
array.

12/27

The second assembly is an injector that will run the executable passed on the first parameter
and inject the code passed on the second parameter into it.

The injected malware is a variant of njRAT. This does not imply that the actor is sophisticated
— it simply shows that the actor uses different RATs.
H-Worm
A malicious document first seen on Dec. 13, 2019 was found downloading and executing a
payload hosted on the same domain.

This sample was packed with a simple chr operation that contacts the domain groups[.]us.
[.]to. Once unpacked, it was clear that it was H-Worm developed by an actor that uses the
handle "houdini".

13/27

These are the same two kinds of malicious applications that are listed in the aforementioned
Microsoft indictment.
The designer
A deeper look into the njRAT sample took us down another line of investigation. As we
mentioned above, this sample has a very convoluted packaging, but one of the steps is to
download the final stage from https://satlahlk[.]github[.]io/msc/cl.png. This GitHub account
indicates that the owner is in Brazil, but the njRAT function names are in Spanish.
We found it unusual that the PowerShell crypter contains references to the Portuguese
soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo. "Chris" is the Brazilian and Spanish diminutive to Cristiano.

A search for the GitHub account was a dead end, just like the mutex created by the rat name
"TikTok". However, the njRAT variant seems to have unique details to pivot off.
14/27

In the C2 communication, the RAT uses "@!#&^%$" as a field delimiter, as we can see on
the page below that string is defined as a byte array, which is converted into characters when
it is used.

On the right side of the image, we can see the hex definition of the byte array creation
instead of the decompiled code. Since this is a very specific string, we decided to use it as a
pivot point. A search by the bytes "0A800600000420391B0000800800000420011400008D"
revealed three other samples, all contacting the same domain.
These samples have an additional pivoting point: They create a mutex called "UbboSatlahlk,"
which contains part of the previously mentioned GitHub account. This mutex seems unique
enough to warrant additional investigation. It supplies seven samples, which contain the
same domain — and based on the mutex, the names are clearly linked to our original
sample.
A search for that mutex on the internet revealed that it is also a username on a cybersecurity
Spanish-speaking forum. The Spanish language is also consistent with two other indicators
— first, the RAT functions are all written in Spanish, and the majority of IPs used by the
domain are located in the Dominican Republic, a country where the official language is
Spanish.

15/27

In this message, the user says they are writing a crypter, but are having some troubles. This
is a rather old message from 2016 just like the first appearance of the domain.
Furthermore, a Skype account with the name "UbboSatlahlk" reports its location as being in
Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic, which strengthens the idea that it might be
associated with our designer.
Clustering paradox
This overlap indicates that the groups.us[.]to dynamic domain may also be related to the
same actor. However, this could be a false link if the IP address belonged to a shared host.
On the other hand, if the IP address belonged to a shared host, then there should be a large
number of domains resolving to this IP. In this case, there are only 13, and three of them we
can rule out because they are outside the time frame of the events in question. The
remaining 10 are either dynamic DNS or VPN services that offer static IP. The VPN records
resolution mostly originated from Nigeria, which is also consistent with our research.
On the other side, the remaining TTPs differ from the aviation campaign. The aviation
campaign was mainly distributed through emails containing links to the malware executable
hosted on Google Drive, the payloads are obfuscated using crypters, but there are no
downloadable stages. As we have shown, the malware campaigns associated with this
domain are not consistent with the TTPs of the actor behind the aviation campaigns.
However, we also know that this actor is not particularly technically savvy, and tend to buy
the tools that they use.
16/27

The most likely explanation is that this domain has been used to test new tools from a new
developer. Because there are links to this actor and they are definitively linked to malicious
activities, we decided to add the domains reserverem[.]duckdns[.]org and
monthending[.]duckdns[.]org to the list of IOCs, even though we didn't perform in-depth
research around them.

Actor profiling

Avatars and Pseudonyms
Looking at the campaign details we discussed up to this point, we have strong indications
that this actor has been active at least since 2013. The malicious actor initially used the
CyberGate malware, then moved to another off-the-shelf malware. During our research, we
linked the early campaigns related to akconsult to a handle — "Nassief2018" — on another
popular hacking forum. The same account also mentions that it uses the usernames
"bodmas" and "kimjoy" on other RAT platforms.

During interactions on this forum, the user also revealed other information about himself.
Namely, an email address — kimjoy44@yahoo[.]com — and a Telegram account —
@pablohop. Both accounts were linked to the aviation-themed campaigns in this post.

On Skype, the actor's email is associated with the username "abudulakeem123."

Geographic location

17/27

While researching the actor's activities, using passive DNS telemetry, we compiled the list of
IPs used by the domain akconsult.linkpc.net. The chart below shows that roughly 73 percent
of the IPs were based in Nigeria, further strengthening the theory that the actor in question is
based in Nigeria.

The same happens, with an even higher percentage with the bodmas[.]linkpc[.]net
hostname, but this is a more recent hostname that has pointed to fewer IP addresses.

Other sources
Often while performing this kind of research, it's worth performing a simple web search using
the keywords obtained from other sources. While doing this, we found the tweet below made
by .sS.! which, on top of containing some of the information we found, also contains
additional information about the actor.

18/27

Some of this information matches what we found on our own research, others are completely
new and we have not been able to confirm this Twitter user's claims.

Conclusion
Many actors can have limited technical knowledge but still be able to operate RATs or
information-stealers, posing a significant risk to large corporations given the right conditions.
In this case, we have shown that what seemed like a simple campaign is, in fact, a
continuous operation that has been active for three years, targeting an entire industry with
off-the-shelf malware disguised with different crypters.

19/27

These kinds of small operations tend to fly under the radar and even after exposure the
actors behind them wont stop their activity. They abandon the C2 hostnames — which in this
case are free DNS-based and they may change the crypter and initial vector, but they won't
stop their activity. The black market for web cookies, tokens and valid credentials is way too
valuable when compared with the economy in their home countries for them to stop.
We also hope this illustrates how to pivot malware research based on OSINT alone.
However, it is important to be careful with weak links that could lead to erroneous
conclusions. The weak links shouldn't be discarded — they should be seen as one more
piece of information that, together with other links, may result in a much stronger relationship
between two pieces of information.
