Disrupting SEABORGIUM’s ongoing phishing operations
microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/08/15/disrupting-seaborgiums-ongoing-phishing-operations
August 15, 2022

The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) has observed and taken actions to disrupt
campaigns launched by SEABORGIUM, an actor Microsoft has tracked since 2017.
SEABORGIUM is a threat actor that originates from Russia, with objectives and victimology
that align closely with Russian state interests. Its campaigns involve persistent phishing and
credential theft campaigns leading to intrusions and data theft. SEABORGIUM intrusions
have also been linked to hack-and-leak campaigns, where stolen and leaked data is used to
shape narratives in targeted countries. While we cannot rule out that supporting elements of
the group may have current or prior affiliations with criminal or other nonstate ecosystems,
MSTIC assesses that information collected during SEABORGIUM intrusions likely supports
traditional espionage objectives and information operations as opposed to financial
motivations.
This blog provides insights into SEABORGIUM’s activities and technical methods, with the
goal of sharing context and raising awareness about a significant threat to Microsoft
customers. MSTIC would like to acknowledge the Google Threat Analysis Group (TAG) and
the Proofpoint Threat Research Team for their collaboration on tracking and disrupting this
1/17

actor. Microsoft’s ability to detect and track SEABORGIUM’s abuse of Microsoft services,
particularly OneDrive, has provided MSTIC sustained visibility into the actor’s activities and
enabled us to notify impacted customers. As an outcome of these service abuse
investigations, MSTIC partnered with abuse teams in Microsoft to disable accounts used by
the actor for reconnaissance, phishing, and email collection. Microsoft Defender
SmartScreen has also implemented detections against the phishing domains represented in
SEABORGIUM’s activities.

Who is SEABORGIUM?
SEABORGIUM is a highly persistent threat actor, frequently targeting the same organizations
over long periods of time. Once successful, it slowly infiltrates targeted organizations’ social
networks through constant impersonation, rapport building, and phishing to deepen their
intrusion. SEABORGIUM has successfully compromised organizations and people of interest
in consistent campaigns for several years, rarely changing methodologies or tactics. Based
on known indicators of compromise and actor tactics, SEABORGIUM overlaps with the
threat groups tracked as Callisto Group (F-Secure), TA446 (Proofpoint) and COLDRIVER
(Google). Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) has associated Callisto with Gamaredon Group
(tracked by Microsoft as ACTINIUM); however, MSTIC has not observed technical intrusion
links to support the association.
Since the beginning of 2022, Microsoft has observed SEABORGIUM campaigns targeting
over 30 organizations, in addition to personal accounts of people of interest. SEABORGIUM
primarily targets NATO countries, particularly the US and the UK, with occasional targeting of
other countries in the Baltics, the Nordics, and Eastern Europe. Such targeting has included
the government sector of Ukraine in the months leading up to the invasion by Russia, and
organizations involved in supporting roles for the war in Ukraine. Despite some targeting of
these organizations, Microsoft assesses that Ukraine is likely not a primary focus for this
actor; however, it is most likely a reactive focus area for the actor and one of many diverse
targets.
Within the target countries, SEABORGIUM primarily focuses operations on defense and
intelligence consulting companies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and
intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), think tanks, and higher education. SEABORGIUM
has a high interest in targeting individuals as well, with 30% of Microsoft’s nation-state
notifications related to SEABORGIUM activity being delivered to Microsoft consumer email
accounts. SEABORGIUM has been observed targeting former intelligence officials, experts
in Russian affairs, and Russian citizens abroad. As with any observed nation-state actor
activity, Microsoft directly notifies customers of Microsoft services that have been targeted or
compromised, providing them with the information they need to secure their accounts.

Observed actor activity
2/17

Over many years of tracking, Microsoft has observed a consistent methodology from
SEABORGIUM with only slight deviations in their social engineering approaches and in how
they deliver the initial malicious URL to their targets. In this section, we provide detailed
analysis of SEABORBIUM’s operational tactics as well as several examples of their
campaigns.

Impersonation and establishing contact
Before starting a campaign, SEABORGIUM often conducts reconnaissance of target
individuals, with a focus on identifying legitimate contacts in the targets’ distant social
network or sphere of influence. Based on some of the impersonation and targeting observed,
we suspect that the threat actor uses social media platforms, personal directories, and
general open-source intelligence (OSINT) to supplement their reconnaissance efforts.
MSTIC, in partnership with LinkedIn, has observed fraudulent profiles attributed to
SEABORGIUM being used sporadically for conducting reconnaissance of employees from
specific organizations of interest. In accordance with their policies, LinkedIn terminated any
account (including the one shown below) identified as conducting inauthentic or fraudulent
behavior.

3/17

SEABORGIUM also registers new email accounts at various consumer email providers, with
the email address or alias configured to match legitimate aliases or names of impersonated
individuals. While the creation of new consumer accounts is common, we have also
observed SEABORGIUM returning to and reusing historical accounts that match the industry
of the ultimate target. In one case, we observed SEABORGIUM returning to an account it
had not used in a year, indicating potential tracking and reusing of accounts if relevant to
targets’ verticals.
After registering new accounts, SEABORGIUM proceeds to establish contact with their
target. In cases of personal or consumer targeting, MSTIC has mostly observed the actor
starting the conversation with a benign email message, typically exchanging pleasantries
before referencing a non-existent attachment while highlighting a topic of interest to the
target. It’s likely that this additional step helps the actor establish rapport and avoid
suspicion, resulting in further interaction. If the target replies, SEABORGIUM proceeds to
send a weaponized email.

Figure

2: Example email showing the multi-email approach and rapport building frequently used by
the actors.
MSTIC has also documented several cases where the actor focuses on a more
organizational approach to phishing. In these cases, the actor uses an authoritative
approach in their social engineering and typically goes to directly sending malicious content.

4/17

3: Example phishing email from 2022 where the actor impersonates the lead of an
organization and emails select members of the organization with a cybersecurity themed
lure.
These examples serve to demonstrate the actors’ capability to be dynamic and to adapt their
social engineering approach to gain the trust of their victims.

Delivery of malicious content
Microsoft has identified several variations in the way that SEABORGIUM delivers a link that
directs targets to their credential stealing infrastructure.
URL in body of email
In the simplest case, SEABORGIUM directly adds a URL to the body of their phishing email.
Occasionally, the actor leverages URL shorteners and open redirects to obfuscate their URL
from the target and inline protection platforms. The email varies between fake personal
correspondence with a hyperlinked text and fake file sharing emails that imitate a range of
platforms.

user to actor-controlled infrastructure.
PDF file attachment that contains a URL
MSTIC has observed an increase in the use of attachments in SEABORGIUM campaigns.
These attachments typically imitate a file or document hosting service, including OneDrive,
and request the user to open the document by clicking a button.

file used in campaigns. The PDF files appear to be a failed preview, redirecting the users to
click a link which takes the user to actor-controlled infrastructure.
OneDrive link to PDF file that contains a URL
SEABORGIUM also abuses OneDrive to host PDF files that contain a link to the malicious
URL. This activity does not represent any security issues or vulnerabilities on the OneDrive
platform. The actors include a OneDrive link in the body of the email that when clicked
directs the user to a PDF file hosted within a SEABORGIUM-controlled OneDrive account.
As seen in the previous example, the victim is presented with what appears to be a failed
preview message, enticing the target to click the link to be directed to the credential-stealing

7/17

infrastructure. Occasionally, SEABORGIUM makes use of open redirects within the PDF file
to further disguise their operational infrastructure. In the example below, SEABORGIUM
uses a Google URL for redirection.

Figure

7: Example document hosted on OneDrive that uses a Google redirect link to send users to
actor-controlled infrastructure.

Credential theft
Regardless of the method of delivery, when the target clicks the URL, the target is directed to
an actor-controlled server hosting a phishing framework, most often EvilGinx. On occasion,
Microsoft has observed attempts by the actor to evade automated browsing and detonation
by fingerprinting browsing behavior. Once the target is redirected to the final page, the
framework prompts the target for authentication, mirroring the sign-in page for a legitimate
provider and intercepting any credentials. After credentials are captured, the target is
redirected to a website or document to complete the interaction.

Data exfiltration and impact
SEABORGIUM has been observed to use stolen credentials and directly sign in to victim
email accounts. Based on our experience responding to intrusions from this actor on behalf
of our customers, we have confirmed that the following activities are common:
Exfiltration of intelligence data: SEABORGIUM has been observed exfiltrating
emails and attachments from the inbox of victims.
Setup of persistent data collection: In limited cases, SEABORGIUM has been
observed setting up forwarding rules from victim inboxes to actor-controlled dead drop
accounts where the actor has long-term access to collected data. On more than one
occasion, we have observed that the actors were able to access mailing-list data for
sensitive groups, such as those frequented by former intelligence officials, and
maintain a collection of information from the mailing-list for follow-on targeting and
exfiltration.

9/17

Access to people of interest: There have been several cases where SEABORGIUM
has been observed using their impersonation accounts to facilitate dialog with specific
people of interest and, as a result, were included in conversations, sometimes
unwittingly, involving multiple parties. The nature of the conversations identified during
investigations by Microsoft demonstrates potentially sensitive information being shared
that could provide intelligence value.
Based on the specific victimology, documents stolen, conversations fostered, and sustained
collection observed, we assess that espionage is likely a key motivation of the actor.

Sporadic involvement with information operations
In May 2021, MSTIC attributed an information operation to SEABORGIUM based on
observations and technical overlaps with known phishing campaigns. The operation involved
documents allegedly stolen from a political organization in the UK that were uploaded to a
public PDF file-sharing site. The documents were later amplified on social media via known
SEABORGIUM accounts, however MSTIC observed minimal engagement or further
amplification. Microsoft was unable to validate the authenticity of the material.
In late May 2022, Reuters along with Google TAG disclosed details about an information
operation, specifically using hack and leak, that they attributed to
COLDRIVER/SEABORGIUM. Microsoft independently linked SEABORGIUM to the
campaign through technical indicators and agrees with the assessment by TAG on the actor
responsible for the operation. In the said operation, the actors leaked emails/documents from
2018 to 2022, allegedly stolen from consumer Protonmail accounts belonging to high-level
proponents of Brexit, to build a narrative that the participants were planning a coup. The
narrative was amplified using social media and through specific politically themed media
sources that garnered quite a bit of reach.
While we have only observed two cases of direct involvement, MSTIC is not able to rule out
that SEABORGIUM’s intrusion operations have yielded data used through other information
outlets. As with any information operation, Microsoft urges caution in distributing or
amplifying direct narratives, and urges readers to be critical that the malicious actors could
have intentionally inserted misinformation or disinformation to assist their narrative. With this
in mind, Microsoft will not be releasing the specific domain or content to avoid amplification.

Recommended customer actions
The techniques used by the actor and described in the “Observed actor activity” section can
be mitigated by adopting the security considerations provided below:
Check your Office 365 email filtering settings to ensure you block spoofed emails,
spam, and emails with malware.
Configure Office 365 to disable email auto-forwarding.
10/17

Use the included indicators of compromise to investigate whether they exist in your
environment and assess for potential intrusion.
Review all authentication activity for remote access infrastructure, with a particular
focus on accounts configured with single factor authentication, to confirm authenticity
and investigate any anomalous activity.
Require multifactor authentication (MFA) for all users coming from all locations
including perceived trusted environments, and all internet-facing infrastructure–even
those coming from on-premises systems.
Leverage more secure implementations such as FIDO Tokens, or Microsoft
Authenticator with number matching. Avoid telephony-based MFA methods to avoid
risks associated with SIM-jacking.
For Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Customers:
Use Microsoft Defender for Office 365 for enhanced phishing protection and coverage
against new threats and polymorphic variants.
Enable Zero-hour auto purge (ZAP) in Office 365 to quarantine sent mail in response to
newly acquired threat intelligence and retroactively neutralize malicious phishing,
spam, or malware messages that have already been delivered to mailboxes.
Configure Defender for Office 365 to recheck links on click. Safe Links provides URL
scanning and rewriting of inbound email messages in mail flow, and time-of-click
verification of URLs and links in email messages, other Office applications such as
Teams, and other locations such as SharePoint Online. Safe Links scanning occurs in
addition to the regular anti-spam and anti-malware protection in inbound email
messages in Exchange Online Protection (EOP). Safe Links scanning can help protect
your organization from malicious links that are used in phishing and other attacks.
Use the Attack Simulator in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 to run realistic, yet safe,
simulated phishing and password attack campaigns within your organization. Run
spear-phishing (credential harvest) simulations to train end-users against clicking URLs
in unsolicited messages and disclosing their credentials.
