Attracting more than a half-million annual readers, this is the security community's go-to
destination for technical breakdowns of the latest threats, critical vulnerability disclosures
and cutting-edge research.
For the price of a Starbuck’s Caramel Frappuccino Grande and a cheese Danish, about $8,
a cybercriminal can obtain all the information needed to max out a person’s stolen credit
card and possibly steal their identity.
This is just one example dredged from the Dark Web by the elite Trustwave SpiderLabs
team while it was conducting research for an exhaustive study into what cybercriminals
charge for stolen records.

1/12

The team found repositories of financial and identity records along with VPN and remote
desktop access credentials in various Darknet markets and uncovered a complicated
pricing structure that sees threat actors pricing their information in the same manner as any
seller on a legitimate retail site. Prices vary depending upon the country from which the
information was stolen and the quality and depth of the content associated with the
credential.
So, why are these records sold instead of used by the thieves? The answer is simple
expediency. Criminals opt to sell credit card and driver’s license information wholesale
instead to quickly cash out and to avoid the time and trouble required to use the assets.
Generally, threat actors’ activity is divided into business fields, someone is digging,
attacking, and others are selling data or extracting user information and using it to obtain
money. If the hacker or group does not know how to use the stolen information – they sell it.
SpiderLabs found that in most cases, what is being sold on a forum was previously sold or
used by a hacker. So, a buyer may not get first-hand hacked data.
And these threat actors do cash out. For example, the FBI’s 2021 Internet Crime Report
stated credit card fraud in the U.S. resulted in $172,998,385 in losses, and this only takes
into account reported incidents.

What’s For Sale on the Dark Web?
The better question is – what is not for sale on the Dark Web, but let’s focus on financial,
identification and access data.
Here is a quick list of the items SpiderLabs found:
Credit cards
Bank account information
Access to organizations through their VPNs and other means
Social Security numbers
Passports
Driver’s licenses
And the ability to create the supporting documentation to prove these credentials
belong to the purchaser.

Each item is subdivided by the type of card being offered. For example, a common credit
card with “Fullz” can cost between $8 and $70. Fullz means that for the posted price the
buyer is also given additional information on the victim. This can include name, address,

Social Security number, driver’s license, bank account credentials, and medical records, all
wrapped up in one package and all of which enables the buyer to better utilize the stolen
credential.
Trustwave SpiderLabs found three “classes” of credit card for sale. Cloned cards with fullz,
common credit card with fullz and different classes of credit cards, such as gold, platinum,
business, etc.
Cloned cards range in price from $50 to $1,500 with the cost depending upon the credit limit
assigned to the card. The higher the limit, the pricier the card. Common cards, as previously
noted, run from $8 and $70, per card and generally comes with fullz. The price for the final
type varies slightly between regions, $30 to $140 in the U.S. and slightly less in the EU and
Asia.

Selling Fraudulent Supporting Documentation
One class of documentation for sale in these marketplaces shows how much thought
criminal actors will go to make their stolen data valuable.
Some sites will create false documentation to help a buyer prove to a bank or financial
institution that they are in fact the true owner of the credentials they purchased.

4/12

The advertisements for these credit cards are brazen and full of details.
The common verification flow has the person who bought the stolen bank needing to
confirm identity to the bank. So, the actor, to prove his identity, must provide a photo with
himself holding an ID, like a passport or driver’s license, along with the bank account
information.
To provide such picture for verification, malicious attackers utilize the services of
Drawer/Artist who can be found on a Dark Web market. The Dark Web artist creates the
required ID using the photo a drop person. The drop person – is someone who will
physically go to the bank to get the money or use the document as proof for an online
withdrawal.

While this form of identification is not the norm in many countries, it can work at a bank with
low security standards.

This artist group developed used high-end tools to create a quality finished product. The
artists can even add the required holograms and mimick watermarks on the identification
documents.

Fake documents. With this approach, even modern verification video calls could be easily
passed by introducing such printed IDs.

Bank Accounts
Bank account pricing, $100 to $3,000 per account, is directly tied to the amount of money
that can be accessed. The higher the amount that can be stolen, the more expensive the
purchase. Additionally, the price correlates to how easy it is to access the bank account as
some banks might not be easier for a criminal to fool.
The seller usually mentions the balance on that account along with the victim’s physical
address. This can be done to hint at the target’s potential level of wealth, a toney address in
Los Angeles or New York City might garner more interest from a buyer.

9/12

Typically, those buying a bank account gain online access, the account and routing number,
any debit card and PIN information available, the owner’s name and signature, phone
number and billing address. The owner’s IP address along with the operating system used
to access the account might also be included.
While this information is generally used to digitally access an account, the criminal could go
to the financial institution and use this information to simply withdraw the money in person.
Stealing the money in this manner is one way to defeat any multifactor authentication that
might protect the account, but it also opens up the possibility of the individual being caught
and arrested.

Buying Virtual Private Network Credentials
VPN access credentials were the most expensive records SpiderLabs found being
advertised. This is logical considering what a threat actor can do once inside an
organization. Everything from stealing money, corporate espionage, IP theft, seeding
malware and planting ransomware are all on the table once access is gained.
Our researchers found one ad asking $5,000 for access to a corporate network, while
another was priced at $2,500 for VPN credentials purportedly to a Korean company with an
estimated $7 billion in revenue.
Ads for VPN access can offer a great deal of detail to help persuade a buyer. Sometimes
they mention the businesses industry but the price for the access is generally determined
by the company’s revenue, as can be seen in this list of examples from the XSS forum.
Note that the word ‘jealousy’ in the document is a bad translation for ‘revenue.’

VPN access advertisements.
For this price, the seller provides administrator access to a server on the network. The
ability to access other machines on the network depends on local permissions and the way
the network is configured in that organization.
If a company has a solid cybersecurity defense in place even this level of access might not
be enough to do severe damage. The ability to use that access for malicious purposes will
be limited in environments that are fairly restricting, use network segmentation, and check
for anomalies etc.
