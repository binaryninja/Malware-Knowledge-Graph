The Kittens Are Back in Town 3
Introduction
Executive Summary
During 2017-2019, Clearsky had published several reports about the Iranian APT group “Charming
Kitten”. One of the group’s most common attack vectors is impersonating journalists, particularly
those from the German “Deutsche Welle” broadcasting company and the “Jewish Journal” magazine1.
Starting July 2020, we have identified a new TTP of the group, impersonating “Deutsche Welle” and the
“Jewish Journal" using emails alongside WhatsApp messages as their main platform to approach the
target and convince them to open a malicious link. To gain the victim's trust and ensure the opening
of the link, the attackers use fake LinkedIn profiles as well. This is the first time we identified an attack
by Charming Kitten conducted through WhatsApp and LinkedIn, including attempts to conduct phone
calls between the victim and the Iranian hackers. Charming Kitten chooses to impersonate Persian
speaking journalists, to neutralize detection through accent while having the phone call. In this report,
we expose for the first time the full conversation between Charming Kitten to a victim, conducted on
WhatsApp.
The malicious link is embedded in a legitimate, compromised "Deutsche Welle” domain. Each victim
receives a personalized link, tailored to their specific email account. We identified an attempt to send
a malicious ZIP file to the victim as well, additional to a message that was sent to the victim via a fake
LinkedIn profile. We assess that in some cases, Charming Kitten would try to infect the victim with
malware instead of stealing its credentials.
“Charming Kitten”, also known as APT35 or “Ajax”, is an Iranian cyberespionage group active since
2014. Their primary targets are Iranian academia experts, human rights' activists, and journalists. In the
past few months, it seems that Charming Kitten has expanded their target’s list, adding the Baha’i
community2, high-ranking American civil servants and officials (including ambassadors and former
employees of the US State Department), and COVID-19 related organizations (such as Gilead3 and
WHO4). In the current campaign, we identified attempts to attack Israeli scholars (targeting their
institutional email account), and US government employees.
Here is a timeline of their operations involving “Deutsche Welle” and “Jewish Journal” in the past 3
years:

Clearsky alerted “Deutsche Welle” about the impersonation and the watering hole in their website. A
“Deutsche Welle” representative confirmed that the reporter which Charming Kitten impersonated, did
not send any emails to the victim nor any other academic researcher in Israel in the past few weeks.
Note that part of "Deutsche Welle" reporters are originally from Iran – a fact that helps Charming Kitten
to hide the accent of their operators during a phone call.
It should be noted that this attack vector is unique to Charming Kitten, but it has not the only attack
vector that has been used in recent months by this threat actor. More information about recent
campaigns by the group can be found in our raw threat intelligence5 or on our blog6.

Deployment Vector: WhatsApp and LinkedIn
In recent months, we identify an increase in the use of WhatsApp and LinkedIn as platforms of
communication between threat actors and victims. In the last three years, Charming Kitten has been
operating their campaigns mainly by emails and SMS. These two platforms enable the attacker to
reach the victim easily, spending minimum time in creating the fictitious social media profile. However,
in this campaign Charming Kitten has used a reliable, well-developed LinkedIn account to support
their email spear-phishing attacks.
In this campaign, we observed a willingness of the attackers to speak on the phone directly with the
victim, using WhatsApp calls, and a legitimate German phone number. This TTP is uncommon and
jeopardizes the fake identity of the attackers (unlike emails for example). However, if the attackers have

successfully passed the phone call obstacle, they can gain more trust from the victim, compared to an
email message.
Charming Kitten is not the first threat actor who uses WhatsApp phone call in recent months. In
Operation ‘Dream Job’, which we exposed in August 2020 7, the Lazarus group (North Korea) used the
same method to gain the victim's trust.

Attack Vector
Introduction
This latest campaign of Charming Kitten uses enhanced social engineering techniques already
discovered in our report “The Kittens Are Back in Town” in 20198. In the 2019 scenario, the attackers
had impersonated a known journalist, almost always from “Deutsche Welle”. In 2020 Charming Kitten
offers the victim to participate in an online webinar/meeting about Iran and other subjects of interest
for the target (e.g. recent discourse between Iran and the US). The Charming Kitten operators introduce
themselves as journalists and ask the victim whether they are interested in participating in the webinar.
If so, they are requested to reply in order to receive the following details:
1. A full list of other participants
2. Date and time for the webinar
3. Details regarding the payment for attending the webinar.
This attack vector was carried out by Charming Kitten between 2018 to early 2020. Here is an example
for the email sent allegedly from Keyarash Navidpour, a reporter in DW, to an Israeli academia scholar9:

However, in August 2020 we have identified a change in attack methods, which will be presented in
detail in the following chapter.

Social Engineering Methods Used to Establish a Credible Communication
First stage – approaching the victim by email
In most of the cases that we handled in the past several months, the targeted academia researchers
had high awareness and suspected that they are probably under an Iranian attack. Their suspicion led
them to contact us and further contact with Charming Kitten under our guidance (i.e. not opening the
emails sent to them). Over the course of the past several weeks, one of the targets was lured to respond
to the attackers. The subject of impersonation was an Iranian journalist that speaks fluent Farsi with a
local accent.
The correspondence begun with an email sent to the target, initiating a conversation. Unlike previous
attacks, the attackers did not display details regarding the alleged webinar; instead, they asked to start
a conversation.
Several attempts were made to contact Israeli researchers from Haifa and Tel Aviv Universities' email
addresses, hosted on a Microsoft email server (Outlook).

In another case, the attacker impersonated an Israeli scholar from Tel Aviv University and invited them
to an alleged "Zoom" meeting in Hebrew.

After a short conversation with the target, the Charming Kitten attacker requests, for the first time, to
move the conversation to WhatsApp. This is not the first use of a mobile messaging service (for instance

phishing using SMS), but the first case where we have seen the use of WhatsApp. If the target refuses
to move to WhatsApp, the attacker will send a message via a fake LinkedIn profile. Here’s an example
of “Marcy Oster” – a fake profile used by the Iranians in their attack.

To convince the victim to join the alleged webinar, the attackers tried to entice the victim with
nominating them as its main speaker, chosen from more than a hundred participants. They claimed
that further information about the alleged webinar will be shared after approving the invitation. The
subject of the webinar is changed by Charming Kitten from one victim to another, based on their
expertise.

Second Stage – WhatsApp and LinkedIn
After this conversation with the target, the attacker requests that they switch to WhatsApp for further
conversation.
Charming Kitten sent multiple and repeating messages, sometimes in very short time, until the target
responded. The messages were sent from a German number (prefix +49) to create a sense of credibility,
and the WhatsApp account bears the image of the journalist being impersonated. Unlike other groups,
Charming Kitten chooses to impersonate Persian speaking journalists, to neutralize detection through
the accent.

Here is the full correspondence (names redacted):

Attacker

The Charming Kitten attackers implore the victim to respond repeatedly for ten days, and they are
prepared to engage in a direct phone call with them to cajole the victim into “activating their account”
with the site "Akademie DW" (used as their phishing page). During our investigation, we addressed DW,
which confirmed that the reporter never contacted the victim and that the alleged webinar is fake. The
webinar’s subjects were previously used by the group as lures. In May 2020, for example, the group
impersonated the INSS and lured victims to a webinar regarding China-related research.
If the victim is not willing to share their personal phone number, the attacker will send him a message
from the fake LinkedIn account. This message will contain a promise that the webinar is secured by
Google, as they sent to the victim on the tenth day:

Third Stage – Approving attending in the webinar
The malicious link was on the Deutsche Welle legitimate domain (dw[.]de). As previously reported in
“The Kittens are Back in Town”. Each victim receives a personalized link for their own email address –
the word “?id=”, following by the word SSH and 3 sets of 5 letters and numbers. Here’s an example for
the format:
hxxp://akademie.dw[.]de/lecture/?id=SSH-******-******-******

In 2018, the Charming Kitten group had impersonated Clearsky, embedding the same phishing format
in the malicious imposter domain10:

Attempting to access any service other than Outlook leads to a legitimate log-in page. Accessing the
Outlook page displays a fictitious log-in field including a victim-specific URI:

The Clearsky impersonation from 2018 presented the same phishing page (we identify in the fake
website a page impersonated Jewish Journal as well). Both cases included a file named lgntopl.gif on
the domain, characterizing Outlook phishing pages. If the victim enters their correct password, they

are sent to a 2FA page (as previously seen with direct interactions by the group11). A wrong password
produces an error message. The attackers will then pressure the victim to try again using their
university email.

This propagation vector is unique compared to other, common vectors by the group (such as ".site"
TLD phishing websites), and the WhatsApp correspondence has not been exposed until this case.

Malicious file
Another example of a fake LinkedIn account is “Helen Cooper”, a senior researcher at Hudson Institute
(a think tank and research center dedicated to the analysis of US and international economic, security,
and political issues). Charming Kitten created a fake profile for the attack and deleted the account
later.

After the initial message via the fake LinkedIn profile, Charming Kitten sent the victim two different
types of compromise attempts from this account:
1. An email message with a malicious link
2. An email message with a malicious file attached
Unlike the common TTPs of this threat actor, sending an attached malware is unique and was not seen
in recent attacks by them. The victim deleted the file before we were able to analyze it. The following
screenshot shows the correspondence between the attacker and the victim.
