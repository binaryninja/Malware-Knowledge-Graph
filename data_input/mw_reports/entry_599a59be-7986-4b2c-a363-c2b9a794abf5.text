Incident Report

Published: March 16, 2021

Executive Summary
In January, we became aware of a security incident later determined to be conducted by the
same sophisticated threat actor responsible for the SolarWinds supply chain attack. During
our investigation, we learned that the threat actor used the SolarWinds supply-chain
compromise to gain access to part of our production grid environment. Using this entry point,
the threat actor accessed certain Mimecast-issued certificates and related customer server
connection information. The threat actor also accessed a subset of email addresses and
other contact information, as well as encrypted and/or hashed and salted credentials. In
addition, the threat actor accessed and downloaded a limited number of our source code
repositories, but we found no evidence of any modifications to our source code nor do we
believe there was any impact on our products. We have no evidence that the threat actor
accessed email or archive content held by us on behalf of our customers.
When we became aware of the security incident, we immediately launched an internal
investigation. Our investigation was supported by leading third-party forensics and cyber
incident response experts at Mandiant, a division of FireEye, and in coordination with law
enforcement to aid their investigation into this threat actor. As the investigation progressed,
we issued a series of advisories to affected customers, including recommended
precautionary steps to mitigate risk.
We have now completed our forensic investigation with Mandiant and have eliminated the
threat actor’s access to our environment. We have already taken a number of actions to
prevent future access to our environment as described below and we will continue to monitor
for threats and take precautionary steps as needed.
Incident Details and Remediation Actions
The following provides a more detailed summary of our investigation, as well as an overview
of the steps taken to address this attack and further enhance our environment.
Phase 1
In January, Microsoft notified us that a certificate we provide to customers to authenticate
Mimecast Sync and Recover, Continuity Monitor, and IEP products to Microsoft 365
Exchange Web Services had been compromised by a threat actor they were actively
investigating. Microsoft informed us that the threat actor used the certificate to connect to a
low single-digit number of our mutual customers’ M365 tenants from non-Mimecast IP
address ranges.

While the evidence showed that this certificate was used to target only the small number of
customers, we quickly formulated a plan to mitigate potential risk for all customers who used
the certificate. We made a new certificate connection available and advised these customers
and relevant supporting partners, via email, in-app notifications, and outbound calls, to take
the precautionary step of switching to the new connection. Our public blog post provided
visibility surrounding this stage of the incident.
We coordinated with Microsoft to confirm that there was no further unauthorized use of the
compromised Mimecast certificate and worked with our customers and partners to migrate to
the new certificate connection. Once a majority of our customers had implemented the new
certificate connection, Microsoft disabled the compromised certificate at our request.
Phase 2
Supported by Mandiant, we confirmed that the incident was related to the SolarWinds Orion
software compromise and was perpetrated by the same sophisticated threat actor. Our
investigation determined that the initial intrusion resulted from SUNBURST malware, the
backdoor present in the compromised version of SolarWinds Orion software we had
previously used in our environment.
Our investigation revealed suspicious activity within a segment of our production grid
environment containing a small number of Windows servers. The lateral movement from the
initial access point to these servers is consistent with the mechanism described by Microsoft
and other organizations that have documented the attack pattern of this threat actor. We
determined that the threat actor leveraged our Windows environment to query, and
potentially extract, certain encrypted service account credentials created by customers
hosted in the United States and the United Kingdom. These credentials establish
connections from Mimecast tenants to on-premise and cloud services, which include LDAP,
Azure Active Directory, Exchange Web Services, POP3 journaling, and SMTP-authenticated
delivery routes. We have no evidence that the threat actor accessed email or archive
content held by us on behalf of our customers.
Although we were not aware that any of the encrypted credentials were decrypted or
misused, we issued a specific advisory to customers hosted in the United States and United
Kingdom to take precautionary steps to reset their credentials. At this time, we published an
additional public blog post.
Phase 3
As the investigation progressed, we determined that the threat actor had established
additional access methods to the same segment of our production grid environment. We
removed and blocked the threat actor’s means of access. All compromised systems were
Windows-based and peripheral to the core of our production customer infrastructure. We
completely replaced all compromised servers to eliminate the threat.

2/5

At this point, we were able to determine the specific scope of data access and confirm
exfiltration by the threat actor. We have no evidence that the threat actor accessed email
or archive content held by us on behalf of our customers. The threat actor did access a
subset of email addresses and other contact information and hashed and salted credentials.
Some of this information required us to notify the affected customers and partners under
certain regulations, which we have done. We are resetting the affected hashed and salted
credentials as a precautionary step.
The investigation revealed that the threat actor accessed and downloaded a limited number
of our source code repositories, as the threat actor is reported to have done with other
victims of the SolarWinds Orion supply chain attack. We believe that the source code
downloaded by the threat actor was incomplete and would be insufficient to build and run
any aspect of the Mimecast service. We found no evidence that the threat actor made any
modifications to our source code nor do we believe that there was any impact on our
products. We will continue to analyze and monitor our source code to protect against
potential misuse.
In March, we completed our forensic investigation with Mandiant.
Customer Impact
We have no evidence that email or archive content was accessed by the threat actor.
Beyond the low single-digit number of customers targeted by the threat actor, which we
contacted as described in our first blog post, we are not aware that any other
customers were actively targeted.
As described in our second blog post, we recommended that customers hosted in the
United States and United Kingdom reset as a precautionary measure any server
connection credentials in use on the Mimecast platform.
We are resetting the affected hashed and salted credentials as a precautionary step.
We do not believe that the threat actor made any modifications to our source code.
Forensic analysis of all customer-deployed Mimecast software has confirmed that the
build process of the Mimecast-distributed executables was not tampered with.
The threat actor accessed some information that required us to notify the affected
customers and partners under certain regulations, which we have done.
Additional Mimecast Remediation Steps

3/5

We have completed the following actions:
Rotated all impacted certificates and encryption keys.
Upgraded encryption algorithm strength for all stored credentials.
Implemented enhanced monitoring of all stored certificates and encryption keys.
Deployed additional host security monitoring functionality across all of our
infrastructure.
Decommissioned SolarWinds Orion and replaced it with an alternative NetFlow
monitoring system.
Rotated all Mimecast employee, system, and administrative credentials, and
expanded hardware-based two-factor authentication for employee access to
production systems.
Completely replaced all compromised servers.
Inspected and verified our build and automation systems to confirm that
Mimecast-distributed executables were not tampered with.
Implemented additional static and security analysis across the source code tree.
We are in the process of implementing a new OAuth-based authentication and
connection mechanism between Mimecast and Microsoft technologies, which will
provide enhanced security to Mimecast Server Connections. We will work with
customers to migrate them to this new architecture as soon as it is available.
