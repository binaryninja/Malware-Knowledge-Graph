On February 28, the McAfee Advanced Threat Research team discovered that the
cybercrime group Hidden Cobra continues to target cryptocurrency and financial
organizations. In this analysis, we observed the return of Hidden Cobra’s Bankshot
malware implant surfacing in the Turkish financial system. Based on the code similarity,
the victim’s business sector, and the presence of control server strings, this attack
resembles previous attacks by Hidden Cobra conducted against the global financial

network SWIFT.
In this new, aggressive campaign we see a return of the Bankshot implant, which last
appeared in 2017. Bankshot is designed to persist on a victim’s network for further
exploitation; thus the Advanced Threat Research team believes this operation is intended
to gain access to specific financial organizations.
Based on our analysis, financial organizations in Turkey were targeted via spear phishing
emails containing a malicious Microsoft Word document. The document contains an
embedded Adobe Flash exploit, which was recently announced by the Korean Internet
Security agency. The exploit, which takes advantage of CVE-2018-4878, allows an attacker
to execute arbitrary code such as an implant.
the Further investigation into this campaign and analysis of McAfee product telemetry
shows that the infection occurred on March 2 and 3. The implant’s first target was a
major government-controlled financial organization. It next appeared in another Turkish

government organization involved in finance and trade. A further three large financial
institutions in Turkey were victims of this attack. The implant has so far not surfaced in
any other sector or country. This campaign suggests the attackers may plan a future
heist against these targets by using Bankshot to gather information.

also contains functionality to wipe files and content from the targeted system to erase
evidence or perform other destructive actions. Bankshot was first reported by the
Department of Homeland Security on December 13, 2017, and has only recently
resurfaced in newly compiled variants. The sample we analyzed is 99% similar to the
documented Bankshot variants from 2017.

Analyzing Bankshot
The sample (a2e966edee45b30bb6bb5c978e55833eec169098) is a Windows DLL that
serves as a backdoor and contains a variety of capabilities. The malicious DLL is not a
service DLL because it lacks ServiceMain(). To mask itself, it can run as a regular library
loaded into a legitimate process.
The malware begins by creating a new thread from the DllMain() function to carry out its
malicious activities:

New thread created in the malware’s DllMain() function.
The malware performs the following activities:
Builds imports by dynamically loading APIs
Decrypts strings needed for control server communications
Performs control server communications
Handles commands issued by the control server
Uninstalls self from the system
The malicious thread dynamically loads the APIs it needs at the beginning of its execution
using LoadLibrary() and GetProcAddress(). APIs from the following libraries are loaded at
runtime:
Kernel32.dll

Ws2_32/wsock32.dll
Apvapi32.dll
Oleaut32.dll
Iphlp.dll
Urlmon.dll

A dynamic API loaded by the malware.

Based on packet capture analysis of previous implants from 2017, the following strings
are used in control server communications:
Connection: keep-alive
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Accept: */*
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=
Content-Type: application/octet-stream
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,sdch
Accept-Language: ko-KR -> Korean

Content-Disposition: form-data;name=”file1″; filename=”img01_29.jpg”
Content-Disposition: form-data;name=”file1″; filename=”my.doc”
Content-Disposition: form-data;name=”file1″; filename=”pratice.pdf”

Content-Disposition: form-data;name=”file1″; filename=”king.jpg”

Content-Disposition: form-data;name=”file1″; filename=”hp01.avi”
Content-Disposition: form-data;name=”file1″; filename=”star.avi”

User Agents
The implant either fetches the user agent from Internet Explorer (using
ObtainUserAgentAsString()) or uses a default user agent specified in the malware binary:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) Chrome/28.0.1500.95 Safari/537.36

Control Server Communications
The malware initiates communication with the control server by sending it an HTTP POST
request with additional optional HTTP data, such as:
------FormBoundary<randomly_generated_characters>
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="board_id"
8306
------FormBoundary<randomly_generated_characters>
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="user_id"
*dJU!*JE&!M@UNQ@
------FormBoundary<randomly_generated_characters>
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file1"; filename="king.jpg"
Content-Type: application/octet-stream
board_id is a four-digit number that may be an identifier for a campaign ID. Based on
analysis of previous samples, this is a unique identifier.

Connections
The US government reports that Bankshot is used by Hidden Cobra to target multiple
industries including financial organizations. This implant has been connected to a major
Korean bank attack and is also known as Trojan Manuscript. That variant contained the
capability to search for hosts related to the SWIFT network and the same control server
strings as the variant we found targeting the Turkish financial sector. The implant does
not conduct financial transactions; rather it is a channel into the victim’s environment, in
which further stages of implants can be deployed for financial reconnaissance. The

Bankshot implant was also observed in 2017 in documents appearing to come from Latin
American banks.

These connections, combined with the implant’s nearly identical appearance to known
variants, are a strong indication that we have uncovered a Hidden Cobra attack. Further,
previous implants from 2017 contained bogus documents with financially themed
content.

Conclusion
We have found what may be an early data-gathering stage for future possible heists from
financial organizations in Turkey (and possibly other countries). In this campaign, we see
the adoption of a recent zero-day Adobe Flash vulnerability to get the implant onto the

victim’s systems.
The campaign has a high chance of success against victims who have an unpatched
version of Flash. Documents with the Flash exploit managed to evade static defenses and
remain undetected as an exploit on VirusTotal. This is the first time that Bankshot has
been tied directly to financial-related hacking and the first time it has been used since
November 2017.
McAfee detects these threats as:
RDN/Generic Exploit
RDN/Generic.dx
Generic PWS.y
Generic.hbg
Exploit-CVE2018-4878
