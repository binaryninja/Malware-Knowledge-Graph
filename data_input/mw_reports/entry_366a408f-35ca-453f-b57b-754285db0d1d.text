Check How RAT Malware Is Using Telegram to Evade Detection
Malware is a collective term for any type of malicious software designed to harm or exploit
programmable devices, services, or networks. Cybercriminals often use it to extract data that
they can use to financially exploit their victims. This data can range from financial data to
health records, personal emails and passwords; the possibilities of what kind of information
can be compromised are endless. Digitization is increasing day by day and so are cyber
attacks, scams and malware attacks. Although users take many security measures to protect
themselves from such attacks, hackers find various ways to penetrate users’ devices.
Now, cybersecurity researchers have issued an important warning to Telegram users:
Devices and PCs are being hacked by Windows-based malware that spreads via fake
Telegram Messenger app installers. Malware can hide from installed antivirus systems, steal

your data and download other malicious files to the system. In this way, many users may not
know that their device is already infected. ToxicEye is a type of malware called a Remote
Access Trojan (RAT). RATs can allow an attacker to remotely control an infected computer.

Malware that chats on Telegram
In early 2021, dozens of users abandoned WhatsApp and switched to messaging apps that
promised more data security after the company announced it would share users’ default
metadata with Facebook. Many of those users turned to rival apps Telegram and Signal.
According to us, Telegram was the most downloaded app in January 2021, with over 63
million installs. Telegram chats aren’t end-to-end encrypted like Signal chats, and now
Telegram has another problem: malware.
Software company Check Point recently discovered that malicious actors were using
Telegram as a communication channel for a malware program called ToxicEye. It turns out
that attackers can use some features of Telegram to interact with their malware more easily
than through web-based tools. They can now mess with infected computers through a helpful
Telegram chatbot.

What is ToxicEye and how does it work?
ToxicEye is a type of malware called a Remote Access Trojan (RAT). RATs can give an
attacker remote control over an infected computer, which means that:
steal data from the host computer.
delete or transfer files.
kill the processes running on the infected computer.
hijack computer microphone and camera to record audio and video without user’s
consent or knowledge.
encrypt files to extort money from users.
ToxicEye RAT is spread via a phishing scheme in which the targeted person receives an
email with an embedded EXE file. When the targeted user opens the file, the program
installs the malware on their device. RATs are similar to remote access programs that, for
example, allow a technician to take control of your computer to fix a problem. But these
programs sneak around without permission. They can mimic or be hidden within legitimate
files, often disguised as documents or embedded in a larger file, such as a video game.

The chain of infection
The attacker first creates a Telegram account, then a Telegram “bot”, which can
perform actions remotely through the app.
This bot token is embedded in malicious source code.

This malicious code is sent as spam, which is often disguised as something legitimate
that the user can click on.
The attached file is opened, installed on the host computer, and sends the information
to the attacker’s command center via the Telegram bot.
