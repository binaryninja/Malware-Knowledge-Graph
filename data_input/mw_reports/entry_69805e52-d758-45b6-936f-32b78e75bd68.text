Group behind the SingHealth breach is also responsible for a string
of other attacks in the region.
In July 2018, an attack on Singapore’s largest public health organization, SingHealth,
resulted in a reported 1.5 million patient records being stolen. Until now, nothing was known
about who was responsible for this attack. Symantec researchers have discovered that this
attack group, which we call Whiteﬂy, has been operating since at least 2017, has targeted
organizations based mostly in Singapore across a wide variety of sectors, and is primarily
interested in stealing large amounts of sensitive information.
Whiteﬂy compromises its victims using custom malware alongside open-source hacking
tools and living off the land tactics, such as malicious PowerShell scripts.

Whiteﬂy’s targets
From mid-2017 to mid-2018, Whiteﬂy launched targeted attacks against multiple
organizations. While most of these organizations were based in Singapore, some were
multinational organizations with a presence in Singapore.
To date, Whiteﬂy has attacked organizations in the healthcare, media, telecommunications,
and engineering sectors.

Whiteﬂy ﬁrst infects its victims using a dropper in the form of a malicious .exe or .dll ﬁle that
is disguised as a document or image. These ﬁles frequently purport to offer information on
job openings or appear to be documents sent from another organization operating in the
same industry as the victim. Given the nature of disguise, it’s highly likely that they are sent
to the victim using spear-phishing emails.
If opened, the dropper runs a loader known as Trojan.Vcrodat on the computer. Whiteﬂy
has consistently used a technique known as search order hijacking to run Vcrodat. This
technique takes advantage of the fact that Windows does not require an application to
provide a speciﬁc path for a DLL that it wishes to load. If no path is provided, Windows
searches for the DLL in speciﬁc locations on the computer in a pre-deﬁned order. Attackers
can therefore give a malicious DLL the same name as a legitimate DLL but place it ahead
of the legitimate version in the search order so that it will be loaded when Windows
searches for it. Whiteﬂy frequently delivers Vcrodat as a malicious DLL that has the same
name as DLLs belonging to legitimate software from various security vendors. The group
leverages search order hijacking to assure that its malicious DLLs will be executed.
Targeting security applications could allow the attackers to gain higher privileges for the
malware, since the vendor’s component may be run with elevated privileges.
Once executed, Vcrodat loads an encrypted payload on to the victim’s computer. The
payload contacts a command and control (C&C) domain. Whiteﬂy conﬁgures multiple C&C
domains for each target. The payload sends system information about the infected
computer to the C&C server and downloads additional tools.
Whiteﬂy usually attempts to remain within a targeted organization for long periods of time—
often months—in order to steal large volumes of information.
Once the initial computer on the targeted organization’s network is infected with Vcrodat,
Whiteﬂy begins mapping the network and infecting further computers. In order to carry out
this operation, it uses publicly available tools, including Mimikatz (Hacktool.Mimikatz) and
an open-source tool (SHA2:
263dc5a8121d20403beeeea452b6f33d51d41c6842d9d19919def1f1cb13226c) that exploits
a known Windows privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2016-0051) on unpatched
computers. The attackers rely heavily on tools such as Mimikatz to obtain credentials.
Using these credentials, the attackers are able to compromise more machines on the
network and, from those machines, again obtain more credentials. They perform this tactic
repeatedly until they gain access to the desired data.
Whiteﬂy usually attempts to remain within a targeted organization for long periods of time—
often months—in order to steal large volumes of information. It keeps the compromise alive
by deploying a number of tools that facilitate communication between the attackers and
infected computers. These tools include a simple remote shell tool that will call back to the
C&C server and wait for commands, and an open-source hacking tool called Termite
(Hacktool.Rootkit), which allows Whiteﬂy to perform more complex actions such as
controlling multiple compromised machines at a time.

Additional malware used in selected attacks
In some attacks, Whiteﬂy has used a second piece of custom malware, Trojan.Nibatad.
Like Vcrodat, Nibatad is also a loader that leverages search order hijacking, and downloads
an encrypted payload to the infected computer. And similar to Vcrodat, the Nibatad payload
is designed to facilitate information theft from an infected computer.

While Vcrodat is delivered via the malicious dropper, we have yet to discover how Nibatad
is delivered to the infected computer. Why Whiteﬂy uses these two different loaders in
some of its attacks remains unknown. And while we have found both Vcrodat and Nibatad
inside individual victim organizations, we have not found any evidence of them being used
simultaneously on a single computer.

Links to other attacks
Some of the tools that Whiteﬂy has used in its attacks have also been deployed in other
targeted attacks outside Singapore.
Between May 2017 and December 2018, a multi-purpose command tool (SHA2:
7de8b8b314f2d2fb54f8f8ad4bba435e8fc58b894b1680e5028c90c0a524ccd9) that has
been used by Whiteﬂy was also used in attacks against defense, telecoms, and energy
targets in Southeast Asia and Russia. The tool appears to be custom-built and, aside from
its use by Whiteﬂy, these were the only other attacks where Symantec has observed its
use.
In another case, Vcrodat was also used in an attack on a UK-based organization in the
hospitality sector.
It's possible Whiteﬂy itself performed these attacks but it’s more likely that they were carried
out by one or more other groups with access to the same tools.

Adept attackers with a large toolset
It now appears that the SingHealth breach was not a one-off attack and was instead part of
a wider pattern of attacks against organizations in the region. Whiteﬂy is a highly adept
group with a large arsenal of tools at its disposal, capable of penetrating targeted
organizations and maintaining a long-term presence on their networks. Links with attacks in
other regions also present the possibility that it may be part of a broader intelligence
gathering operation.
