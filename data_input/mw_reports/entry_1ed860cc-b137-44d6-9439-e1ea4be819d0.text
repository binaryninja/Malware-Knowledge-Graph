The Evolution of GandCrab Ransomware
vmray.com/cyber-security-blog/gandcrab-ransomware-evolution-analysis/

[Editor‚Äôs Note: This post was updated on July 9th, 2018 with analysis of Gandcrab v4]
Like legitimate commercial software, commercial malware also needs a viable business
model. For ransomware, the most popular business model is now Ransomware-as-a-Service
(RaaS). RaaS focuses on selling ransomware as an easy-to-use service, opening up a
broader market of non-technical attackers. Many ransomware developers now focus on
developing and maintaining a service which allows their affiliates (customers) to start attacks
with just a few clicks.
In the past few months, the RaaS-space was dominated by a relatively new malware family:
GandCrab.

Gandcrab‚Äôs Distribution Methods
We‚Äôve seen Gandcrab being distributed using two primary methods:
Javascript and Doc downloaders attached to e-mails
Drive-by download using exploit kits

Javascript Droppers
Javascript Dropper #1
View the VMRay Analyzer Report

1/36

A common distribution method is zipped Javascript droppers attached to emails.

After deobfuscating itself the javascript executes a Powershell one-liner to download and
execute a file, Gandcrab v2 (internal version 1.2.0).

Javascript Dropper #2 doesn‚Äôt use PowerShell. Instead, it downloads the file and executes it
directly. The payload is Gandcrab v3 (internal version 3.3.0).

Doc Droppers use the same logic as the Javascript Droppers, but implemented in VBA. This
sample contains an 800 line VBA script like this snippet:

The end result is another PowerShell one-liner, which downloads an EXE to a temporary
directory, and executes it.

Encrypted Doc Dropper
View the VMRay Analyzer Report
A more recent spam campaign used encrypted doc files, with the emails containing the
password to open the doc: 123123. This dropper executed the sample (Gandcrab v3.0.1)
directly with VBA, without Powershell.

Exploit Kits
Attackers also used multiple exploit kits: Grandsoft, RIG and Magnitude.
Using a browser exploit kit is a tradeoff from the attacker‚Äôs point-of-view. If the victim has an
unpatched version of browser or flash player, they only need to click a link to get infected. It
is much easier for the attacker to get someone to click a link than to get them to download
and execute a file ‚Äî but the attack won‚Äôt work if the potential victim has even roughly up-todate software.

RIG EK
View the VMRay Analyzer Report
RIG is a popular exploit kit, which has recently been updated with a newer Flash exploit
(CVE-2018-4878). It used the new exploit for dropping Gandcrab, observed on April 9 by
@nao_sec.

4/36

As visible on the sandbox report and the packet capture, this attack vector exploited Adobe
Flash Player, downloaded and executed Gandcrab v3.0.1.

RIG used the Flash exploit for CVE-2018-4878. This happened before a new exploit for an
Internet Explorer vulnerability (CVE-2018-8174) was implemented in RIG.
CVE-2018-4878 is also a relatively new vulnerability ‚Äì on February 1st Adobe released a
bulletin, informing users that a Flash player zero-day is being used in the wild, and followed
up with a patch on February 6th. The exploit uses a use-after-free bug in Flash Player‚Äôs DRM
implementation. The downloaded SWF file is partly obfuscated, but it contains some debug
symbols, making some key parts of the exploit easy to spot, like the class UAFGenerator .

5/36

The payload of the exploit is visible in the sandbox report ‚Äì cmd.exe is called to drop and
execute a javascript downloader.

Even after a little bit of deobfuscation, the downloader activity becomes clear:

6/36

The downloaded file is dropped in the %TEMP% directory with the name b**.exe, where ** is
a number in the [0, 56] range. At the end the dropper executes the downloaded Gandcrab
v3.0.1 payload.

The attack is visible in the VMRay Analyzer Report:

For an old Internet Explorer version, the exploit kit served CVE-2016-0189, an exploit of a
memory corruption vulnerability in Internet Explorer‚Äôs vbscript.dll. This is an old vulnerability,
patched in May 2016, which allows running arbitrary vbscript code on unpatched systems.
The VBS exploit code is obfuscated, but still readable. The downloader is in the fire()
function. It first downloads the file (See Figure below):

It then executes the downloaded file, depending on its extension:

8/36

The full control flow shows the exploited Internet Explorer process downloaded an exe file
(Gandcrab v2.1, internal version 3.0.0), and executed it with cmd.exe. The Process Graph
shows the Gandcrab packer injected its DLL payload into svchost.exe.

Packer
Gandcrab uses its own packer, which has only changed a little through all the versions.
Sandbox Evasion: API hammering
Even the first versions of Gandcrab used API hammering, a very simple sandbox evasion
technique. The technique calls an API function in a loop, hoping the analysis will time out
before reaching any malicious behavior. This can be effective against sandboxes which
handle the loop slowly ‚Äì the slower a sandbox is, the more dramatic are the effects of API
hammering.
Gandcrab‚Äôs packer often mixes the technique with one of the two following techniques:

9/36

1. Doing something in the loop that‚Äôs necessary for the execution to continue. This
ensures that the loop can‚Äôt simply be detected as unnecessary and skipped
automatically.
2. Loop cycles where no APIs are called.
Each version of the Gandcrab packer uses different API functions, and iteration numbers, but
the principle is the same.
In this v1.0 sample the loop is repeated 200 million times, but only one of its iterations is
useful:

Sample
SHA256: 69f55139df165bea1fcada0b0174d01240bc40bc21aac4b42992f2e0a0c2ea1d
In this v3.0.0 sample the loop gets the temp path and allocates memory, but takes 5 million
loops to do it:

Sample
SHA256: 6a8d922e34de35ac074b7de54d71227fb1a1ed92b9cfbc4daf8d64a9c5bc46b8

Reflective Loader
Gandcrab v2‚Äôs (internal version v.1.0.0r), main functionality is moved to a DLL. The DLL‚Äôs
name is ‚Äúencryption.dll‚Äù, and only exports the entry point, and a function named
ReflectiveLoader()
.

The packer calls the ReflectiveLoader function, loads the DLL and starts the malicious
activity which is in DLLMain.
The DLL is loaded in the same process for most samples, but with Gandcrab 3.0.0 it was
observed injecting the DLL into a newly spawned svchost process.

Sample SHA256: 6fafe7bb56fd2696f2243fc305fe0c38f550dffcfc5fca04f70398880570ffff

String Obfuscation Method
The packer and the payload use the same method to obfuscate strings used as API
parameters for many calls: simply moving them to the stack in 4-byte blocks before the
calling a function which uses them as a parameter. @hasherezade made a deobfuscator IDA
plugin for this technique.

Easter Eggs for Researchers
The packer and payload also contain messages to researchers who made a public impact on
Gandcrab, or ransomware in general.
If a file exists in the C:\MalwarebytesLabs directory , a message to Marcelo Rivero pops up.
Hello, #GandCrab

üôÇ pic.twitter.com/ICHixxoIkI

‚Äî Marcelo Rivero (@MarceloRivero) 17 April 2018
Fabian Wosar‚Äôs name is used as a placeholder string multiple times per sample.

Communication with the C&C is encrypted with a hardcoded key. Since the release of
Gandcrab v2, this key is computed using the string ‚Äúeuropol‚Äù ‚Äì the name of the agency partly
responsible for creating a decryptor for v1.

13/36

Gandcrab v4 Packer
Version 4.0 of Gandcrab rewrites large parts of the ransomware with many previously
implemented features missing. The removed features include parts of the packer.
The packer doesn‚Äôt use the reflective DLL loading method anymore, and reverts to simply
replacing parts of its own process in memory.
Besides the removal of the DLL loading technique, a new obfuscation technique was added
to the beginning of the packer. The technique starts by moving the obfuscated code to the
stack in 4-byte blocks, like the string obfuscation method from previous versions. After this,
the packer proceeds to use subtractions and additions to deobfuscate the code on the stack.

14/36

The first samples of v4.1 we‚Äôve seen were unpacked, but later samples were packed with the
same packer as v4.0.

Gandcrab Payload History
Gandcrab v1
The GandCrab payload exhibits stereotypical ransomware behavior: it encrypts user files
with a key unique to the victim, and drops ransom notes with instructions to pay the ransom
in exchange for the key.
Gandcrab was first publicly discovered by security researcher David Montenegro in late
January 2018. In one month the family had over 50,000 victims. Unusually, the ransom
needed to be payed in the crypto-currency DASH, now they also accept bitcoin. We
analyzed GandCrab v1 in our January Malware Analysis recap blog.
At the end of February, a decryptor was published for GandCrab v1 in a joint effort by the
Romanian Police (IGPR), Bitdefender and Europol.
Gandcrab v2
15/36

On March 5th, just a week after the decryptor was released, a new Gandcrab version was
spotted by @MalwareHunterTeam. The decryptor from the previous week doesn‚Äôt work with
the newer version. It also uses a new extension (.CRAB), has different hardcoded domains,
and moves the code to a DLL. It also looks for kernel-mode components of Antivirus
software.

Internal Version and Ransom Note
Gandcrab‚Äôs ransom notes contain a version number, and the payload contains another,
‚Äúinternal‚Äù version number, which is sent over the network when connecting to the C&C. Most
often these two version numbers don‚Äôt match (see example below where the ransom note
indicates version 2.1).

Sample SHA256:
846ad2d7e1e133ae4bc2decbc22ae686a44cccaffbee15b4d9b23143f6aa8d3f).
Internal version number reported to the C&C for the same sample is 2.3.2.

Gandcrab v3
A Gandcrab sample with internal version 3.0.0 was spotted on Apr 23 by @nao_sec, later
followed by v3.0.1 first published by @zsawei on May 9th. Version 3.0.0 added support for
changing the wallpaper.
16/36

Discrepancies Between v3.0.0 Samples
It was observed that two samples with the same internal version number (3.0.0) had different
capabilities: one of the samples injects its payload into a new svchost process while another
one doesn‚Äôt start a new process, but can now change the wallpaper.

Gandcrab v4
Gandcrab Version 4.0 appeared in the wild on July 1st, 2018. On July 5th, we found an
updated v4.1 version.

https://t.co/SmYaMz4h7W pic.twitter.com/MTPIBF0rsL
‚Äî VMRay (@vmray) 5 July 2018
Gandcrab v4 has brought many changes from previous versions including modifications
replacing most of the code and a focus on quickly encrypting, then disappearing from the
system. Below are the changes in v4 from previous versions.
The new extension of encrypted files is KRAB, and the ransom note is named KRABDECRYPT.txt
The ransom note contains a private and a public key.
The keys are also written to the registry in
‚ÄúHKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\keys_data\data‚Äù
A new encryption algorithm is used.
The ransomware now also looks for network shares in a separate thread.
Hidden .lock files are dropped into the folders before encrypting contents of the folder

Gandcrab v4.0 doesn‚Äôt connect a C&C. The ransomware still collects the same data it
did on previous versions, (except for the external IP address), and it also creates the
string which it would upload to the server, it just doesn‚Äôt send it.
In v4.1 the C&C connection is back, and it has a URL generation algorithm, replacing
the hardcoded URLs seen in v3

21/36

22/36

23/36

The encryption happens on a different thread than the C&C communication, and the
files are encrypted even if the C&C could not be connected.
Gandcrab removes itself after it‚Äôs done.

Removed Features:
There is no autorun. Gandcrab runs once, then deletes itself.
The wallpaper isn‚Äôt changed
The mutex is not created
No kernel-mode AV checking
Doesn‚Äôt query the machine‚Äôs public IP address from
ipv4bot.whatismyipaddress.com

Payload Control Flow
Most of Gandcrab‚Äôs activity is constant through the versions. The screenshots below show
Gandcrab v3‚Äôs control flow:
Data collection and preparation
Gandcrab first collects data about the system and generates private and public keys.
Domain
Queries the domain the system belongs to.

Processor Name
Queries the processor name and type.
24/36

Mutex
Generates the ransom ID and creates a mutex. This step is skipped in Gandcrab v4.

Kernel-Mode AV
In v2 and v3, Gandcrab starts a thread to look for kernel-mode antivirus components.

List of detected kernel-mode AV-components:
klif.sys (Kaspersky)
kl1.sys (Kaspersky)
fsdfw.sys (F-Secure)
srtsp.sys (Symantec)
srtsp64.sys (Symantec)
NavEx15.sys (Symantec)
NavEng.sys (Symantec)

25/36

Closing Processes
Samples contain a list of hardcoded process names, which are terminated before encryption
starts. Otherwise the processes could have open handles to important files, and the
ransomware wouldn‚Äôt be able to encrypt them.

List of closed processes, constant through versions:

Keyboard Layout
The sample queries the keyboard layout, but only stores if it is Russian or not.

Windows Product Name
Queries the Windows product name.

Processor Architecture:
Queries processor architecture.

Collects Running Antivirus Processes:
Compares running processes with a hardcoded list of antivirus process names.

msmpeng.exe
Iterate Through all Drives
The malware iterates through all letters, to check which drives exist.

If the drive exists, it queries and stores free and used disk space.

IP Address
The malware uses whatismyipaddress.com to query the machine‚Äôs IP before v4.

29/36

C&C Check-ins
Before v4 the samples have their C&C server names hardcoded, and use the .bit
TLD. Since .bit addresses cannot be resolved by most DNS servers, Gandcrab uses
nslookup to resolve the IP addresses. The hardcoded C&C servers and DNS names change
from version-to-version.

In v4.0 there is no C&C communication at all, and in v4.1 the URLs are generated by the
malware, instead of being completely hardcoded.
The data collected in the previous steps is encrypted with a hardcoded key, and then POSTed to the C&C server. The sent data also contains the internal version of the ransomware.

The server responds, and encryption starts. After the encryption the sample does another
check-in to notify the C&C about the successful encryption.
Encryption

A new thread iterates the drive using FindFirstFile ‚Äì FindNextFile and encrypts the files
which have the right extension.

30/36

Shadow Copy Removal
After encryption, the sample removes shadow copies, using wmic on Vista and later, and
vssadmin on XP and earlier.

31/36

Wallpaper
Wallpaper changing was a new feature in v3, which was later removed in v4.

32/36

The wallpaper is not hardcoded inside the sample, it‚Äôs drawn at runtime using the DrawText
function.

The wallpaper file is dropped in the temp folder, and the wallpaper is then changed with
SystemParametersInfo.

Reboot
Finally, the sample sets a reboot in 60 seconds and opens the download page for the Tor
browser.

The reboot and browser opening is removed from Gandcrab v4. Since v4, the malware
instead removes itself after it‚Äôs done.
33/36

Conclusion
Although GandCrab is not a sophisticated piece of malware, it is used in widespread and
frequent campaigns via different distribution methods. The family reacts quickly to changes
like the decryptor for the v1 version, and adds new features often, making it one of the most
prevalent malware families in 2018.
