Cisco Talos has illustrated the ways in which the Iranian backed hacker group has attempted
countries for cyberattacks.

Iranian APT Supergroup MuddyWater has been identified as the hackers linked to attempted
phishing attacks against Turkey and other Asian countries according to findings published by
Cisco Talos. The conglomerate, which has been linked to Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and
Security by the U.S. Cyber Command, has been now identified as multiple different
subgroups acting under the name of MuddyWater rather than one unified threat actor.

How and when the cyberattacks happened
The hacker group has reportedly been targeting these countries using a Windows script file
(WSF) based remote access trojan (RAT) deemed “SloughRAT” by Cisco Talos. Using this
form of malware, MuddyWater has attempted to conduct espionage, steal intellectual
property and commit ransomware attacks against countries in the Arabian Peninsula the
group has zeroed in on. The malicious actors attempted two campaigns against Turkey in
November 2021, and targeted Armenia in June of the same year using the same types of
Windows executable files.
In April 2021, Cisco Talos observed that this group also launched an attack against Pakistan
via two different delivery systems – one employing a PowerShell-based downloader to
accept and execute additional PS1 commands from the C2 server and another using
2/7

malware document infection point that claimed to be part of a court case in Pakistan.
The group, also known as “MERCURY” or “Static Kitten”, has been active since at least
2017, and is known for utilizing ransomware in their previously attempted attacks. According
to the cybersecurity firm, the threat group has been known to use domain name system
(DNS) attacks on its intended victims by using “PowerShell, Visual Basic and JavaScript
scripting along with living-off-the-land binaries (LoLBins) and remote connection utilities to
assist in the initial stages of the infection.”

According to Cisco Talos’ findings, the hacking group’s “Variety of lures and payloads —
along with the targeting of several different geographic regions — strengthens our growing
hypothesis that MuddyWater is a conglomerate of sub-groups rather than a single actor.”
The cybersecurity firm believes that the hacking group is a combination of smaller teams,
targeting specific regions such as the Arabian Peninsula and Asia utilizing the different types
of attacking techniques above. While MuddyWater is incorporated by smaller sub-groups,
Cisco Talos believes that some of these teams are contracted out for attacks by the leaders
and organizers of MuddyWater. One reason for this belief is that there have been unique
strings and watermarks identified as being shared between MuddyWater and the
Phosphorus/Charming Kitten APT groups.
These shared techniques among these smaller teams are seemingly preferred by threat
actors in certain regions, making them identifiable as not belonging to the same areas as
other attacks by the collective. The two preferred methods of attacks highlighted by the
cybersecurity firm were the SloughRAT Windows executable file, and the Ligolo reverse
tunneling tool which was used against Middle Eastern countries in March 2021.

How to secure yourself and your business
While this hacker group has been specifically targeting regions and countries throughout the
world, cyber threats remain an important thing to keep in mind for both individuals and
organizations. With this in mind, it is important to be ready with both antivirus software and
extremely thorough training to make sure that systems have not been compromised and
employees are aware of the online risks to avoid being victimized.
