At the Security Analyst Summit, our researchers showcase how a Brazilian group steals card
information and creates clones of chip-and-PIN cards.

Recently, the United States shifted from using insecure magnetic stripe in credit and debit
cards to better-protected chip-and-PIN cards, which are regulated by the EMV standard.
That’s a big step toward increasing the security of transactions and reducing card fraud, and
one might think that the end is near for the kind of card fraud that relied on cloning.

However, our researchers recently discovered that a group of cybercrooks from Brazil has
developed a way to steal card data and successfully clone chip-and-PIN cards. Our experts
presented their research at the Security Analyst Summit 2018, and here we will try to explain
that complex work in a short post.

Jackpotting ATMs and beyond
While researching malware for ATM jackpotting used by a Brazilian group called Prilex, our
researchers stumbled upon a modified version of this malware with some additional features
that was used to infect point-of-service (POS) terminals and collect card data.
This malware was capable of modifying POS software to allow a third party to capture the
data transmitted by a POS to a bank. That’s how the crooks obtained the card data.
Basically, when you pay at a local shop whose POS terminal is infected, your card data is
transferred right away to the criminals.
However, having the card data is just half the battle; to steal money, they also needed to be
able to clone cards, a process made more complicated by the chips and their multiple
authentications.
The Prilex group developed a whole infrastructure that lets its “customers” create cloned
cards — which in theory shouldn’t be possible.
To learn why it’s possible, you might first want to take a quick look at how EMV cards work.
As for the cloning, we’ll try to keep it as simple as possible.

How the chip-and-PIN standard works
The chip on the card is not just flash memory, but a tiny computer capable of running
applications. When the chip is introduced into a POS terminal, a sequence of steps begins.
The first step is called initialization: The terminal receives basic information such as
cardholder name, card expiration date, and the list of applications the card is capable of
running.
Second is an optional step called data authentication. Here, the terminal checks if the card is
authentic, a process that involves validating the card using cryptographic algorithms. It’s
more complicated than needs to be discussed here.
Third is another optional step called cardholder verification; the cardholder must provide
either the PIN code or a signature (depending on how the card was programmed). This step
is used to ensure that the person trying to pay with a card is actually the same person the
card was issued for.
Fourth, the transaction happens. Note that only steps 1 and 4 are mandatory. In other words,
authentication and verification can be skipped — that’s where the Brazilians come in.

Carding unlimited
So, we have a card that is capable of running applications, and during its first handshake, the
POS asks the card for information about the apps available to it. The number and complexity
of steps needed for the transaction depend on the available applications.
The card-cloners created a Java application for cards to run. The application has two
capabilities: First, it tells the POS terminal there is no need to perform data authentication.
That means no cryptographic operations, sparing them the near-impossible task of obtaining
the card’s private cryptographic keys.
But that still leaves PIN authentication. However, there’s an option in the EMV standard to
choose as the entity checking if the PIN is correct…your card. Or, more precisely, an app
running on your card.
You read that right: The cybercriminals’ app can say a PIN is valid, no matter what PIN was
entered. That means that the crook wielding the card can simply enter four random digits —
and they’ll always be accepted.

Card fraud as a service
The infrastructure Prilex created includes the Java applet described above, a client
application called “Daphne” for writing the information on smart cards (smart card
reader/writer devices and blank smart cards are inexpensive and completely legal to buy.)
The same app is used for checking the amount of money that can be withdrawn from the
card.
The infrastructure also includes the database with card numbers and other data. Whether the
card is debit or credit doesn’t matter; “Daphne” can create clones of both. The crooks sell it
all as a package, mostly to other criminals in Brazil, who then create and use the cloned
cards.

Conclusion
According to Aite’s 2016 Global Consumer Card Fraud report, it is safe to assume that all
users have been compromised. Whether you use a card with a magnetic stripe or a more
secure chip-and-PIN card doesn’t matter — if you have a card, its information has probably
been stolen.
Now that criminals have developed a method to actually clone the cards, that starts to look
like a very serious financial threat. If you want to avoid losing significant amounts of money
through card fraud, we recommend you do the following:

3/4

Keep an eye on your card’s transaction history, using either mobile push or SMS
notifications. If you notice suspicious spending, call your bank ASAP and block the card
right away.
Use AndroidPay or ApplePay if possible; these methods don’t disclose your card data
to the POS. That’s why they can be considered more secure than inserting your card
into a POS.
Use a separate card for Internet payments, because this card is even more likely to be
compromised than those you use only in brick-and-mortar stores. Don’t keep large
sums of money on that card.
