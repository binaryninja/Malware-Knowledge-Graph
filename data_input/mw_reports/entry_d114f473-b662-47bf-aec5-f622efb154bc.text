An affiliate of the GandCrab ransomware-as-a-business (RaaS) has been arrested,
according to an official release. Authorities were able to identify the individual in cooperation
with law enforcement in Romania and the U.K.
The cybercriminal’s identity has not been published but Office “K” of the Ministry of Internal
Affairs in Belarus says that he is a 31-years old living in Gomel, a city in southeastern
Belarus.

Encrypted computers in nearly 100 countries
The arrested GandCrab member was an affiliate, or 'Advert', for the organization and was
responsible for distributing the ransomware to victims.
"It was established that a 31-year-old resident of Gomel who had no previous convictions
infected more than a thousand computers. For decrypting each of them, he demanded an
amount equivalent to 1.2 thousand US dollars. Access to the admin panel for managing the
1/5

ransomware botnet was carried out via the darknet, which allowed the attacker to remain
anonymous for a long time," said Vladimir Zaitsev, Deputy Head of the High-Tech Crimes
Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
"Part of the profit was transferred to the administrators (operators) of the server he leased.
The victims of the hacker were users from almost a hundred countries, and the largest
number of victims were in India, the USA, Ukraine, Great Britain, Germany, France, Italy
and Russia," Zaitsev added.
It is unclear how much money the criminal made from this operation but he shared part of
the paid ransoms with GandCrab administrator(s) who kept a server hidden in the darknet,
allowing affiliates to remain hidden.
As part of their role of infecting victims, GandCrab affiliates would earn 60% for the first
three ransom payments they are responsible for. After the third payment, their revenue
share would jump to 70%.
This means if the arrested affiliate was demanding $1,200 as a ransom payment, they
would earn $840 per victim and the GandCrab developers would earn $360.
Larger affiliates who demanded millions of dollars would stand to make far greater amounts
of payments.
GandCrab shut down their operation on June 1st, 2019, after claiming to have generated
more than $2 billion in ransom payments and personally earning $150 million.

After GandCrab was shutdown, the FBI released the master decryption keys for the
ransomware and BitDefender released a decryptor that allowed victims to recover their files
for free.

It is not known how law enforcement obtained these keys, but it could have been through a
seizure of one of the Tor payment servers.
After GrandCrab shut down, another ransomware variant called REvil, or Sodinokibi, was
created to fill the void left behind.
It has been reported that there are code similarities and ties between the operators/affiliates
of REvil ransomware and GandCrab.

This is just a drop in the bucket.
According to my data, here is a small ranking of countries whose citizens and
migrants pose as Russian hackers:
1st place: Ukraine, almost the entire center of the country, including, to a lesser
extent, Donetsk.
2nd place: Romania, where the work of extortion firms is put on the conveyor belt.
Romanian firms that earn money from extortion are expanding at the expense of
Moldovan citizens who speak Russian.
3rd place: Israel, Turkey, Iran, Azerbaijan, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, China, Korea,
Thailand.
4th place: USA, Canada, UK, Netherlands and neighboring countries.
5th place: Greece, Italy, Kazakhstan, Belarus, the Baltic countries, Finland, Sweden.
As you can see, Belarus is only on the 5th place in this list.

operators should be interrogated more about where are the ransomware creators.
