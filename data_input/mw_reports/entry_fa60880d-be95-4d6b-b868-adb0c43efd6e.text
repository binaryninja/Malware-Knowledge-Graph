Earlier today, Adobe published the security advisory APSA16-03, which describes a critical
vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player version 21.0.0.242 and earlier versions for Windows,
Macintosh, Linux, and Chrome OS:

A few of months ago, we deployed a new set of technologies into our products designed to
identify and block zero day attacks. These technologies already proved its effectiveness
earlier this year, when they caught an Adobe Flash zero day exploit, CVE-2016-1010. Earlier
this month, we caught another zero-day Adobe Flash Player exploit deployed in targeted
attacks.
We believe these attacks are launched by an APT Group we call “ScarCruft”.

2/9

ScarCruft is a relatively new APT group; victims have been observed in several countries,
including Russia, Nepal, South Korea, China, India, Kuwait and Romania. The group has
several ongoing operations utilizing multiple exploits — two for Adobe Flash and one for
Microsoft Internet Explorer.
Currently, the group is engaged in two major operations: Operation Daybreak and
Operation Erebus. The first of them, Operation Daybreak, appears to have been launched
by ScarCruft in March 2016 and employs a previously unknown (0-day) Adobe Flash Player
exploit, focusing on high profile victims. The other one, “Operation Erebus” employs an older
exploit, for CVE-2016-4117 and leverages watering holes. It is also possible that the group
deployed another zero day exploit, CVE-2016-0147, which was patched in April.
We will publish more details about the attack once Adobe patches the vulnerability, which
should be on June 16. Until then, we confirm that Microsoft EMET is effective at mitigating
the attacks. Additionally, our products detect and block the exploit, as well as the malware
used by the ScarCruft APT threat actor.

Reports

APT trends report Q1 2022
This is our latest summary of advanced persistent threat (APT) activity, focusing on events
that we observed during Q1 2022.

Lazarus Trojanized DeFi app for delivering malware
We recently discovered a Trojanized DeFi application that was compiled in November 2021.
This application contains a legitimate program called DeFi Wallet that saves and manages a
cryptocurrency wallet, but also implants a full-featured backdoor.

MoonBounce: the dark side of UEFI firmware
At the end of 2021, we inspected UEFI firmware that was tampered with to embed a
malicious code we dub MoonBounce. In this report we describe how the MoonBounce
implant works and how it is connected to APT41.

The BlueNoroff cryptocurrency hunt is still on
7/9

It appears that BlueNoroff shifted focus from hitting banks and SWIFT-connected servers to
solely cryptocurrency businesses as the main source of the group’s illegal income.
