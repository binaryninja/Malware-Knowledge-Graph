Inside a ‘Reveton’ Ransomware Operation
krebsonsecurity.com/2012/08/inside-a-reveton-ransomware-operation/

The U.S Federal Bureau of Investigation is warning about an uptick in online extortion
scams that impersonate the FBI and frighten people into paying fines to avoid prosecution for
supposedly downloading child pornography and pirated content. This post offers an inside
look at one malware gang responsible for orchestrating such scams.
In an alert published last week, the FBI
said that The Internet Crime Complaint
Center — a partnership between the
FBI and the National White Collar
Crime Center — was “getting
inundated with complaints” from
consumers targeted or victimized by
the scam, which uses drive-by
downloads to hijack host machines.
The downloaded malware displays a
threatening message (see image to the
right) and blocks the user from doing
anything else unless he pays the fine
or finds a way to remove the program.
The FBI alert said the attacks have
Reveton ransomware scam page impersonating the FBI
surged with the help of a “new drive-by
virus” called Reveton; in fact, Reveton
and its ilk are hardly new. These types of attacks have been around for years, but
traditionally have targeted European users. The scam pages used in the attacks mimic
official notices from various national police or investigatory agencies, corresponding to the
country in which the victim resides. For a breakdown of these Reveton-related ransomware
scam pages by country, see this comprehensive gallery set up at botnets.fr.
Reveton.A is blamed in these most recent attacks, and the FBI said it appears Reveton is
being distributed in conjunction with Citadel, an offshoot of the ZeuS Trojan that I have
written about on several occasions. It is certainly possible that crooks are using Citadel to
deploy Reveton, but as I’ll illustrate below, it seems more likely that the attackers in these
cases are using exploit kits like BlackHole to plant both threats on victim PCs.

At least that’s the behavior that’s been observed by a ragtag group of researchers that has
been tracking Reveton activity for many months. Some of the researchers are associated
with botnets.fr, but they’ve asked to remain nameless because of the sensitivity of their work.
One of them, who goes by the screen name “Kafeine,” said much of the Reveton activity
traces back to a group that is controlling the operation using reverse proxies at dozens of
servers scattered across data centers globally (see this PDF for a more detailed look at the
image above).
Kafeine said the groups involved in spreading Reveton are constantly fine-tuning all aspects
of their operations, from the scam pages to solidifying their back-end hosting infrastructure.
The latest versions of Reveton, for example, serve the scam pages from an encrypted
(https://) connection, and only cough up the pages when an infected machine visits and
sends a special request.
Some readers may have a hard time understanding how such schemes could be successful.
To those folks, I say consider the lucrative operations of the once-mighty scareware industry,
which similarly hijacks infected machines with warnings about malware until the victim
relents and pays for some worthless and fake cleaner program.
Kafeine shared a couple of screen shots of two similar and recent ransomware scams (not
Reveton-related) targeting European users that shows just how successful these scams can
be. Both of these images were obtained when security researchers stumbled upon statistics
pages maintained by the criminal groups running the scheme.
The one on the right, for instance, shows that the attackers managed to get their malware
installed on 2,116 PCs in France, and of those, only 3.7 percent — 79 victims — opted to
pay to rid their machines of the ransomware. But those 79 victims each paid $100, earning
the miscreants 7,800 Euros.

That’s the haul from just one country; bear in
mind that this stats page shows the total take
from a single day (May 17, 2012). According to
these stats, at least 322 people from all
countries they ran the scam in opted to pay the
ransom that day, earning the attackers more
than €28,000 (~$34,500)! The next day (the
screen shot below left), the miscreants earned
€43,750 (~$54,000).

Unlike scareware scams, ransomware schemes
do not rely on credit card payments from victims
— a key pressure point for squashing affiliate
programs that help spread this crud. Most
previous ransomware schemes have used
alternative payment systems such as Ukash
and Paysafe. The Reveton attacks that spoof
the FBI instruct victims to pay their “fines” via

MoneyPak, which allows people who don’t have
bank accounts to send money and pay bills at participating businesses. MoneyPak cards are
available for purchase at Wal-Mart, CVS and other retailers, and can be reloaded with cash,
and can be used to send money to PayPal accounts, prepaid credit cards, and to pay bills
for some cell phone companies and DirectTV.
I mentioned earlier that most of these Reveton attacks that have been tracked so far used
versions of the BlackHole exploit kit to deploy the malware. These are kits that are stitched
into hacked or malicious Web sites, so that all visiting browsers are checked for a variety of
insecure, outdated plugins, from Flash to Java to Adobe Reader. Browsers that are found
vulnerable will be handed a Trojan downloader that fetches Reveton and most likely a copy
of the password-stealing Citadel/ZeuS Trojan.
Kafeine and his fellow researchers recently gained access to one of the three main
BlackHole exploit panels used by a Reveton malware gang. The screen shot below shows
the BlackHole administration page; in the upper left portion of the image, we get a sense of
how much traffic these crooks see on any given day. It shows that in just one day, the exploit
kit was sent more than 187,000 potential victims, and that more than 11,000 of those were
successfully seeded with Reveton. The “exploits” stats in the upper right portion of the image
show that, once again, insecure and outdated installations of Java remain by far the most
popular vehicle for exploiting PCs.

A number of Web sites include instructions for removing the Reveton malware without having
to pay the ransom (here’s one example). But it’s important for readers to understand that if
you have been hit by a ransomware attack, the ransomware component is almost certainly
just the most visible of the threats that reside on your system. For one thing, Kafeine said,
the latest Reveton versions will steal all passwords stored on the victim’s PC. What’s more,
the FBI’s report indicates Reveton is being bundled with Citadel, which is an extremely
powerful and advanced family of malware that can be quite difficult to remove.
Attacks such as Reveton illustrate the need to have a solid plan for backing up your data,
because the surest way to clean a machine infected with the likes of Reveton is to
completely reinstall Windows (from the Master Boot Record on up). The most advanced
ransomware threats (the subject of a future post) will steal your passwords and then encrypt
all of your important files before demanding a ransom payment.
