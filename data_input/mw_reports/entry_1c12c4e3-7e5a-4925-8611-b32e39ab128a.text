Deloitte—Threat Intelligence & Analytics | The evolution of the Nymaim Criminal Enterprise

Prologue
Financially motivated threat actors often operate
in ways similar to those of legitimate businesses,
despite the illegal nature of their actions. As with
legitimate businesses, some criminal operations
are more customer-centric than others. Threat
actors that collect payment card information (PCI),
online banking credentials, personally identifiable
information (PII), or protected health information
(PHI) usually sell that data to criminal customers
on underground markets, who use it for fraud.
Consumers of such data often seek data from
specific geographic areas or financial institutions,
so as to facilitate its monetization through
whatever fraud infrastructure they may have, such
as a network of mules to cash out bank accounts,
receive fraudulently purchased packages, or
use fraudulent copies of credit cards for in-store
purchases.
The monetization of ransomware infections
is simpler than that of compromised banking
credentials, PCI, PII, or PHI. Ransomware actors
collect payments directly from their victims,
rather than selling their victims’ data to third
parties. Ransomware operations thus do not
have customers per se, although the ransom
notes of some ransomware families may address
their victims as if they were the customers of a
legitimate business, in the hopes of persuading
victims to pay. The simpler monetization of
ransomware may have contributed to the
escalating number of ransomware attacks and
proliferation of new ransomware families in the
first half of 2016.
At least one criminal group has defied this
overwhelming trend in favor of ransomware –
the one responsible for the Nymaim malware
downloader and its GozNym banking Trojan
variant. This group shifted from its previous use
of ransomware against victims for nearly two
years and has instead begun to target their online
banking credentials. There is no indication of why
this group would undertake this shift after using
ransomware for so long and go against the leading
trend in criminal malware in order to conduct

a type of attack whose monetization is more
complex. It is possible that the group concluded
that the ransomware market was saturated and
thus decided to move into online banking attacks
instead, but this shift began in November 2015 –
before the current spike in ransomware attacks
and proliferation of new ransomware families
began.
Another possibility is that the obsolescence of
this group’s historic police ransomware payloads
left it less capable of competing with the newer
and more sophisticated crypto-ransomware
families. Police ransomware locks a victim’s
screen and uses a law enforcement-themed
message to demand a “fine” for allegedly illegal
online activities. This form of ransomware has
declined, as crypto-ransomware, which encrypts a
victim’s files and holds them for ransom, has now
become the prevailing form of ransomware. This
point nonetheless raises the question of why the
group did not simply begin to use a newer, more
advanced crypto-ransomware payload instead.
Like legitimate businesses, criminal threat actors
may have criminal vendors from whom they
purchase products and services that they need
for their own operations. Like many legitimate
technology providers, they may also complement
any proprietary or third-party products or
services with openly available code. In the case
of criminal actors, this freely available code may
come from leaks or the recycling of source code
for criminal malware families on underground
threat actor forums. In the case of the Nymaim
group, they may have originally recycled their
historic ransomware payload from that of another
group. The Nymaim group also reused existing
banking Trojan code when it shifted to online
banking attacks as well. Indeed, it is possible that
the Nymaim downloader, the core of this group’s
operations, may be its only original contribution
to those operations. In any event, it has made that
downloader the centerpiece of an enterprise that
otherwise relies extensively on products, services,
and code from other actors.

Executive Summary
The Nymaim malware family, which includes
its original downloader and its newer GozNym
banking Trojan variant, has been active since at
least 2013. Its origins are unclear, and it may be
the proprietary product of a criminal actor or
group that developed it and retains exclusive
access to it. Some trends in the use of Nymaim
and its variants over the past three years lend
additional credence to that possibility. If Nymaim
activity is the product of just one group, that
group has nonetheless relied extensively on a
variety of external services and sources for both
initial infection vectors and second-stage malware
payloads.
Nymaim’s infection vectors have shifted repeatedly
over the course of three years. A recurring theme
in many of those infection vectors has been the
involvement of other threat actors and groups
that may have provided these infection-enabling
services to Nymaim operators. These other actors
have included TA530, Dmitry “Paunch” Fedotov, and
the operators of the botnet that spreads the Dridex
banking Trojan and Locky ransomware. Despite
these shifts in infection vectors, lure documents
that mimic the branding of accounting software
vendors have been a recurring theme in Nymaimrelated attacks since 2015.
Police ransomware was Nymaim’s typical secondstage payload from its emergence in 2013 until
2015. Nymaim operators may have recycled
elements of previous Romanian ransomware
into their own ransomware payloads. Nymaim
shifted toward the compromise of online banking
credentials. This shift culminated in the April 2016
emergence of GozNym, which combined elements
of both Nymaim and the Gozi ISFB banking Trojan,
AKA Ursnif.1
Nymaim’s early ransomware payloads targeted
a wide range of countries. Its geographic focus
narrowed as it shifted toward online banking
attacks. Key areas of interest include
English-speaking North America, German-speaking
Central Europe, Poland, Portugal and Brazil.2

Origins and Ownership
The source and origins of the Nymaim downloader
remain an intelligence gap for the security
community nearly three years after Nymaim’s
emergence. There is no specific information
on who developed Nymaim and who has been
deploying it in the wild. As of this writing, there
is no significant evidence that it is available to
the criminal actor community on underground
forums, either for sale or via leaks of its source
code.
This ostensible unavailability to the general
criminal community raises the likely possibility
that the unidentified developers of Nymaim
have retained exclusive use of and access to it as
their own proprietary downloader.3 Although the
infection vectors and payloads of Nymaim-related
attacks have shifted over time, other factors would
be consistent with the coordinated operations of
a single group. These factors include: the degree
of consistency in Nymaim-related attacks; the
recurring accounting software theme in their lure
documents; and their clearer geographic focus
since the 2015 shift to online banking targets.
Shifting Infection Vectors
Nymaim first surfaced in July 2013 as one of
many payloads that the “Home Campaign” of
a specific instance of the Black Hole Exploit Kit
(BHEK) delivered.4 The arrest of BHEK operator
Dmitry “Paunch” Fedotov may have prompted
Nymaim to switch its infection vector to blackhat
search engine optimization (SEO) in fall 2013. This
application of SEO techniques raised the Google
search engine ranking of links that redirected
victims to archives that contained malicious
executables with file names relevant to the
targeted search terms. Users may have been
more likely to open these files because they had
been searching for such information.5 Blackhat
SEO services are widely available on underground
forums.
Spam had become another infection vector
for Nymaim by December 2015, when Nymaim
samples surfaced in a spam run from the botnet
that distributes both the Dridex banking Trojan

and Locky ransomware.6 By February 2016,
however, Nymaim operators had begun using
a novel infection vector: legitimate bulk email
marketing services, which may have enabled this
campaign to bypass spam filters. These email
messages contained malicious attachments or
links to malicious documents that used malicious
macros to infect victims. It is unclear if the group
used compromised accounts for such services or
gained access to them via legitimate means.7
As of Q1 2016, Nymaim had also begun to
appear as one of several different payloads in
spear-phishing attacks by TA530, a provider of
spear-phishing services to other actors. The
distinctive feature of TA530 campaigns is the
customization of spear-phishing email messages
to individual targets on an unusually large scale,
such as the use of correct names and contact
and employment information for hundreds
of thousands of targets. Those TA530 spearphishing attacks that delivered Nymaim payloads
used documents with malicious macros. These
Nymaim attacks may have specifically aimed to
infect the computers of employees who might
conduct online banking sessions on behalf of
their companies, which Nymaim operators could
compromise with web injection attacks after

delivering Gozi ISFB as a second-stage payload.8
TA530 continued to use malicious macros to
deliver Nymaim payloads to North American
targets as of late May 2016.9
The only Nymaim infection vector to persist from
2013 to 2016 is the deployment of Nymaim as
a second-stage payload via the separate Pony
loader, AKA Fareit.10The Pony loader is available in
underground threat actor communities, both for
sale and through leaks of its source code.11
Another recurring theme in Nymaim attacks has
persisted in their lure documents since the 2015
shift to banking attacks, despite shifts in infection
vectors. This recurring theme further suggests
that these Nymaim attacks may have specifically
aimed to compromise the computers of
employees with access to corporate bank
accounts. These attacks have often disguised their
malicious documents or links as either invoices or
other transaction documents generated by Intuit
accounting software, such as Quicken or
Quickbooks, or as updates for such Intuit software
packages.12 In April 2016, some Nymaim samples
also began to mimic the branding of Freshbooks, a
different brand of accounting software, in similar
lure documents.13

Invoices are a typical financial theme for malicious
documents or links in criminal spam or phishing
attacks in general. It is also common for threat
actors to disguise malicious files or links as
updates for popular software, such as Adobe Flash

Player. Nonetheless, this repeated mimicking of
the branding of specific accounting software
packages in social engineering lures, for both
financially-themed attacks and fake software
updates, is uncommon.15

Figure 2: Nymaim attack email message from legitimate marketing service16
The use of such social engineering content would be consistent with the targeting of corporate bank
accounts. The branding of such accounting software may be familiar to employees who have access to
corporate bank accounts, such as those in Accounts Payable or Accounts Receivable. Such employees
may thus be more likely to fall for this social engineering and click on the malicious link or document
out of force of habit. Other employees would be less likely to recognize the branding of this accounting
software or associate it with their official responsibilities, and their computers would be of less value to
banking Trojan actors, given the lower likelihood of compromising online banking credentials on
those computers.

Figure 6: Spam to disguise Nymaim as an Intuit software update20
The Shift from Ransomware to Banking Trojans and the Emergence of GozNym
Nymaim’s typical second-stage payload in its early years (2013-2015) was police ransomware. It locked
victims’ screens with a message that accused them of illegal activities, such as the downloading of
copyrighted material or the viewing of child pornography, and instructed them to pay a fine. It displayed
customized lock screens that mimicked the branding of various North American and European law
enforcement agencies, based on a victim’s ostensible location. The ransom note offered Romanian
victims the opportunity to pay in either euros or Romanian currency, the latter of which was cheaper. This
idiosyncrasy had previously appeared in other forms of police ransomware and may have reflected the
recycling of code among threat actors.21
The shift from police ransomware to online banking attacks began in 2015. Nymaim had begun
downloading a Gozi ISFB web injection dynamic link library (DLL) module to use in attacks on online
banking sessions by November 2015.22 Nymaim later began infecting victims with full second-stage Gozi
ISFB payloads by February 2016.23
The hybrid GozNym banking Trojan was first detected in April 2016. It combines Nymaim’s stealth and
persistence features with a modified version of Gozi ISFB’s web injection functionality. Nymaim operators
may have obtained and recycled elements of Gozi ISFB source code from leaks, modified its web injection
functionality, and integrated and recompiled it into the existing Nymaim source code base.24 Accordingly,
most anti-virus software vendors detect GozNym as Nymaim and not as a separate malware family or
a variant of Gozi ISFB, as most of its non-banking behaviors reflect those of Nymaim, rather than Gozi.
It may therefore be more accurate to describe GozNym as a variant of Nymaim than a variant of Gozi.
GozNym samples have used some of the same command and control (C2) infrastructure as Nymaim
samples, which further substantiates the belief that GozNym is a product of the Nymaim operators.25

Issue Date: September 14, 2016 | TLP: White | Serial: W-TS-EN-16-00758 | Industry: All | 09

Deloitte—Threat Intelligence & Analytics | The evolution of the Nymaim Criminal Enterprise

Stealth Features
Early (2013) Nymaim samples concealed their C2 servers by communicating with them through a list
of proxies hard-coded into the binary. It encrypted its normal traffic with RC4 encryption but added
a second, mixed layer of RSA and custom encryption when it downloaded second-stage malware
payloads.26 By October 2015, Nymaim samples featured a domain generation algorithm (DGA).27 As of
April 2016, post-infection traffic for some Nymaim samples used the HTTPS, TCP, and UDP protocols,28
while an April 2016 GozNym sample sent its traffic in the clear via HTTP.29
Other Nymaim stealth techniques include the obfuscation of control flow and API calls and the
encryption of strings in the binary.30 As of November 2015, Nymaim had begun to use a time check as an
anti-analysis technique. The binary would not execute completely after a certain date–for example, two
days after its distribution in the wild.31 GozNym inherited this time check from Nymaim, and samples of it
will not execute after an expiration date.32
Geographic Distribution and Targeting
Country-specific lock screens for victims of Nymaim’s early (2013-2015) police ransomware covered 12
countries: the United States, Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway,
Germany, Austria, France, Spain, and Romania. The amount that it demanded from victims in the United
States ($300) was approximately twice as high as the amounts that it demanded from victims in other
countries, which averaged around $150.33
As of May 2015, Germany had the highest concentration of Nymaim infections by far (76%), with other
significant concentrations in the United States (9%), Austria (8%), Poland (4%), and Portgual (3%).34
Nymaim was also active in Switzerland as of August 2015.35 As of March and early April 2016, the highest
concentrations of GozNym infections were also in the United States, Austria, and Germany (in that order).
Poland and Portugal also had high numbers of GozNym victims relative to the sizes of their respective
populations but declined in relative significance as GozNym spread further beyond North America and
Europe to developing and more populous countries in the Middle East, Latin America, South Asia, and
Southeast Asia.36

The first configuration of the early GozNym samples that originally surfaced in April 2016 targeted 22
U.S. financial institutions and e-commerce platforms and two Canadian financial institutions.37 A second
GozNym configuration that surfaced later in April 2016 targeted 17 Polish banks, one Portuguese bank,
and one U.S. bank. 38 A third GozNym configuration that targeted thirteen German financial institutions
surfaced in August 2016.39

Deloitte—Threat Intelligence & Analytics | The evolution of the Nymaim Criminal Enterprise

Conclusion
Nymaim highlights the importance of
underground threat actor forums and markets
both to the threat actors themselves and as a
source of intelligence for the security community.
In the absence of evidence that Nymaim is
available in such underground communities,
one can reasonably assess that its developer(s)
retained exclusive access to it for their own attacks
over the past three years. If so, the developer(s)
have used it as the proprietary centerpiece of
a criminal enterprise that otherwise depends
heavily on products and services from other
actors and external sources, both for its initial
infection vectors and its second-stage payloads.
Underground communities are typically where
threat actors establish these vendor-client
relationships or obtain malware source code via
purchases or leaks.
Nymaim’s shift away from ransomware and
toward online banking attacks goes against the
current trend toward the proliferation of new
ransomware families and the growing numbers,
scale, sophistication, and severity of ransomware
attacks. Perhaps Nymaim operators decided
that ransomware had already saturated the

market, or that the ransomware bandwagon has
left a vacuum in the market for online banking
credentials to fill. Nymaim operators also never
made the transition from police ransomware
to crypto-ransomware that most ransomware
attacks and operators have made. Police
ransomware has since faded in significance and
grown obsolete as crypto-ransomware, which
encrypts files and holds them for ransom, has
largely replaced it.
Nymaim attacks have acquired a clearer
geographic focus since 2015, the year in which
Nymaim operators shifted from ransomware to
online banking attacks. This clearer focus may
reflect the tendency of many financial institutions
to serve customers in certain geographic areas.
The focus on English-speaking North America
and German-speaking Central Europe reflects
the typical focus of criminal actors on wealthier
markets. Nymaim operators’ interest in Poland
could reflect either the prevalence of such criminal
actors in Eastern Europe, Poland’s extensive
economic ties to neighboring Germany, or some
combination of both. The reason for the Nymaim
operators’ interest in Portugal, a smaller and less
lucrative target, remains unclear.

Recommendations
•• Prioritize the education of users with access to corporate bank accounts about social engineering
threats. These users may be more susceptible to the common financial themes of malicious
attachments and links in many criminal attacks, and the infection of their workstations with banking
Trojans poses a greater risk of financial loss.
•• Block users from enabling macros, especially when they are in Microsoft Office attachments to email
messages from outside your corporate network. New features in Microsoft Office 2016 facilitate the
blocking of macros in such higher-risk situations.
•• If your anti-virus software detects a threat as Nymaim, remember that it might actually be either
GozNym or Nymaim.
•• Use the below indicators to block or detect Nymaim and GozNym attacks.
