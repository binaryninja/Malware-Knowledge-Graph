Return of Emotet malware
zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/return-emotet-malware

Key Points
Emotet is one of the most dangerous, prolific, and long-lasting malware Trojans that has ever
existed.
In January 2021, a law enforcement action disrupted the Emotet malware and its
infrastructure. It also led to the arrest of some of the threat actors involved with the malware.
After almost a year-long hiatus, Emotet has returned to the threat landscape as of Nov 14,
2021.
Distribution of the malware was via the TrickBot malware and email campaigns.
After an almost year-long hiatus, the prolific malware Emotet has returned to the threat landscape.
An early report indicated it returned on Sunday November 14, 2021 and it was being distributed via
the TrickBot botnet. A later report indicated that it was also being distributed via email campaigns.
The Emotet malware was first detected back in 2014 and it focused on banking fraud. In recent
years, Emotet pivoted and it became an initial access broker providing victim access for several
ransomware groups.
In January 2021, law enforcement disrupted the Emotet malware and its infrastructure. It also
arrested some of the threat actors behind it. This led to the disappearance of the malware for almost
a year. Some security researchers thought it was gone for good...
While the Threatlabz team's technical analysis for the payloads involved is ongoing, the new version
of the Emotet malware is similar to its past variants in many aspects. In our quick analysis, we've
observed some changes in the command and control data and encryption used. It also appears to
be using HTTPS instead of plain HTTP for command and control communication. It looks like most
of the functionality is the same as earlier variants, and it will likely pick up where it left off, providing
initial access to the ransomware operators.

Spam Campaigns
As we can see from the below screenshot of spam email, Emotet starts by leveraging a 'reply chain'
email strategy in their spam campaigns. It has been using MS word document “.docm”, MS excel
“.xlsm” and password protected “.zip” files as attachments.
