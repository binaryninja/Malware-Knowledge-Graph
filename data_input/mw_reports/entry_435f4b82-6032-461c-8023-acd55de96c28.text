The phishing campaign targets researchers who document the suppression of women and
minority groups in Iran. Thursday, March 9, 2023 By: Counter Threat Unit Research Team
Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers are investigating suspicious activity
reported via Twitter on February 24, 2023. Multiple individuals involved in Middle Eastern
political affairs research tweeted that than an individual claiming to work for the U.S. Atlantic
Council think tank had contacted them about contributing to an Atlantic Council report in
progress. This individual used the name Sara Shokouhi and the @SaShokouhi (archived)
Twitter account (see Figure 1).

In these solicitations, the SaShokouhi persona claimed to work with Holly Dagres, an Atlantic
Council Senior Fellow. Dagres has publicly denied working with Shokouhi (see Figure 2).

CTU™ researchers discovered that the individual in these photos is not Sara Shokouhi. The
image belongs to a psychologist and tarot card reader based in Russia. The threat group
responsible for the fake Sara Shokouhi persona stole these images from an Instagram
account (see Figure 3) and used them as the basis for the SaShokouhi Twitter account and a
corresponding Instagram account (@sarashokouhii). The fake Instagram profile claims
Shokouhi was studying for or holds a “PhD in Middle East Polotics [sic]”.

Multiple hallmarks of this activity suggest involvement of the Iranian COBALT ILLUSION
threat group (also known as Charming Kitten, APT42, Phosphorous, TA453, and Yellow
Garuda), which is suspected of operating on behalf of the Intelligence Organization of the

2/7

Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp (IRGC-IO) in Iran. COBALT ILLUSION targets a wide
range of individuals and is particularly interested in academics, journalists, human rights
defenders, political activists, intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), and non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) that focus on Iran. The threat actors create a fake persona and then
use it to contact a target with a request for an interview, assistance on a report, or to discuss
a shared interest. Over a period of days or weeks, COBALT ILLUSION develops a rapport
with the target and then attempts to phish credentials or deploy malware to the target's
computer or mobile device. The UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) issued an
advisory in January that included details of COBALT ILLUSION spearphishing activity.
This would not be the first time the threat actors masqueraded as Atlantic Council
employees. In September 2022, CERTFA identified numerous real individuals that COBALT
ILLUSION impersonated, including an Atlantic Council employee. In that campaign, the
group attempted to engage targets in video calls and delivered phishing links via the chat
function at an appropriate point in the conversation.
The @SaShokouhi account has been operating since October 2022. It tweets or retweets
posts supportive of the Mahsa Amini protests in Iran. To appear sympathetic to the
protestors' interests and demands, the account owner has posted cynical content such as
images of dead children, physical abuse suffered by protesters, anti-Iranian government
commentary, and anti-Iranian symbolism.
CERTFA Lab reported a set of phishing indicators related to this suspicious activity. As of this
publication, CTU researchers cannot independently verify an association between the
CERTFA indicators and the @SaShokouhi account. However, these indicators align with
patterns observed in past COBALT ILLUSION activity.
Multiple targets reported that the SaShokouhi persona engaged them in discussion (see
Figure 4). The interactions included requests to visit multiple links.

It is common for COBALT ILLUSION to interact with its targets multiple times over different
messaging platforms. The threat actors first send benign links and documents to build
rapport. They then send a malicious link or document to phish credentials for systems that
COBALT ILLUSION seeks to access. These systems include online email services, social
media services, and other systems used by the target.
Phishing and bulk data collection are core tactics of COBALT ILLUSION operations. In
August 2022, Human Rights Watch reported that COBALT ILLUSION targeted their staff and
obtained user credentials. The threat actors then used the Google Takeout service to export
data from the various services associated with the compromised account, including email,
cloud data storage, and contacts. This information could feed into additional rounds of
phishing attacks, targeting users of interest who have had contact with the initial victim. In
December 2021, the Google Threat Analysis Group (TAG) reported on COBALT ILLUSION's
use of the custom HYPERSCRAPE (also known as EmailDownloader) tool to steal user data
from Gmail, Yahoo, and Microsoft accounts. PwC identified a similar tool called
TelegramGrabber that enabled bulk data collection from Telegram accounts after the threat
actor had obtained the victim's credentials. Data stolen from victims' accounts could be used
to inform intelligence priorities for the IRGC-IO and other COBALT ILLUSION customers.
To mitigate exposure to this malware, CTU researchers recommend that organizations use
available controls to review and restrict access using the indicators listed in Table 1. Note
