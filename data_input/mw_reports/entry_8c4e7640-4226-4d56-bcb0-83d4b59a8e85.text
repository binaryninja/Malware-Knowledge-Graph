Executive Summary
Unit 42 has spent the past four months following the activities of Prometheus, a new player
in the ransomware world that uses similar malware and tactics to ransomware veteran
Thanos.
Prometheus leverages double-extortion tactics and hosts a leak site, where it names new
victims and posts stolen data available for purchase. It claims to have breached 30
organizations in government, financial services, manufacturing, logistics, consulting,

agriculture, healthcare services, insurance agencies, energy and law firms in the United
States, United Kingdom and a dozen more countries in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and
South America.
Like many ransomware gangs, Prometheus runs like a professional enterprise. It refers to its
victims as “customers,” communicates with them using a customer service ticketing system
that warns them when payment deadlines are approaching and even uses a clock to count
down the hours, minutes and seconds to a payment deadline.
“We are closing the ticket and have started an auction on your data,” the group threatens
when victims fail to pay up. But there’s an out: Victims can click to open a new “ticket” if
they’re willing to pay up to stop the auction and recover their data.
Only four victims have paid to date, according to the group’s leak site. It claims that a
Peruvian agricultural company, a Brazilian healthcare services provider and transportation
and logistics organizations in Austria and Singapore paid ransoms. However, we’re unable to
confirm the ransom amounts.
One interesting note is that Prometheus claims to be part of the notorious ransomware gang
REvil. Unit 42 has seen no indication that these two ransomware gangs are related in any
way. The claim may be an attempt to exploit REvil’s name to persuade victims to pay up, or it
could be a false flag to take attention away from Thanos.
We’ve compiled this report to shed light into the threat posed by the emergence of new
ransomware gangs like Prometheus, which are able to quickly scale up new operations by
embracing the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model, in which they procure ransomware
code, infrastructure and access to compromised networks from outside providers. The RaaS
model has lowered the barrier to entry for ransomware gangs.

for response can be viewed in the Unit 42 ATOM Viewer.

Prometheus Ransomware Overview
Prometheus ransomware was first observed in February 2021 and is a new variant of a
known strain called Thanos. Thanos ransomware has been advertised for sale on
underground forums since at least the first half of 2020, where it has a builder that allows
actors to customize a sample with a wide variety of available settings. This suggests that
different threat actors may have leveraged this builder to create their own variants and
brands.

In this case, we turn our attention to one of those threat actors, Prometheus. While this
ransomware gang claims to be part of REvil, we haven’t seen any other solid connection
between the two groups. REvil operates on an affiliate-driven RaaS program, but we believe
the Prometheus ransomware gang may be acting on their own and attempting to leverage
the infamous REvil name and reputation to improve the chance that victims will pay the
demanded ransom. This would not be the first time adversaries have used the names of
well-known threat groups to strengthen their credibility.
At the time of writing, we don’t have information on how Prometheus ransomware is being
delivered, but threat actors are known for buying access to certain networks, brute-forcing
credentials or spear phishing for initial access.
When Prometheus ransomware is executed, it tries to kill several backups and security
software-related processes, such as Raccine, a ransomware prevention tool that tries to stop
ransomware from deleting shadow copies in Windows. Here is a sample of its approach:

Prometheus ransomware appends an extension using the following format .[XXX-XXXXXXX] (Figure 1). We found that the extensions are hardcoded into the sample. We believe
that the Prometheus ransomware operators generate a unique payload per victim, which is
used for their negotiation site to recover files. We obfuscated the extensions because they
could be used to identify the victims on the leak site. Prometheus also adds an hexadecimal
string of GotAllDone at the end of all encrypted files.

Figure 1. Encrypted files after execution.
After the backup and security processes are terminated and encryption is complete,
Prometheus ransomware drops two ransom notes: a RESTORE_FILES_INFO.TXT file and a
RESTORE_FILES_INFO.TXT.hta file (Figure 2), both containing the same information.

Figure 2. RESTORE_FILES_INFO.hta.
The ransom note also includes instructions for contacting Prometheus ransomware
operators to recover files, as well as informing the victim that, if the demands are not met,
the threat actors will release the data to the public or sell it to a third party.
Since the extensions are used as a victim identifier, by following the instructions on the
ransom note, we were able to take a look at the negotiation part of their site using the
extensions ID to gain access. Interestingly, this group uses a ticketing system for tracking
victims. The tickets include a tracking ID, created date, resolution status and priority. A victim
can even open a ticket with the threat actors to request data recovery – though this will cost
you extra, according to the site (Figure 3).

Figure 3. Prometheus reply to a victim ticket.
The Prometheus ransomware gang tailors their ransom demand depending on the victim
organization. From the available instances observed, we have seen payments requested as
low as $6,000 and as high as $100,000 in Monero (XMR). This price is doubled if the victims
don’t contact the threat actors within the established timeframe, which on average is a week.
At the time of writing, four victims paid the ransom including a Peru-based agricultural
company, a healthcare services provider in Brazil, and two transportation and logistics
organizations – one located in Austria and the other in Singapore.

Like many current ransomware gangs, this group also created a leak site (a different section
of the same website that hosts the “ticketing system”) where they name and shame their
victims (Figure 5).

Figure 5. Prometheus leak site.
The Prometheus ransomware operators include a status per victim. We found that some of
the information posted on the leak site has already been sold to an unknown third party.
There are also posts showing that victims within impacted industries paid the ransom and
their data was removed from the site (Figure 6).

At the time of this writing, the Prometheus leak site hosts 30 victims, impacting multiple
industries globally. By taking a look at their victims listed, we generated this graph, showing
the locations of organizations impacted by this ransomware.

Manufacturing was the most impacted industry among the victim organizations we observed,
closely followed by the transportation and logistics industry.

Older Prometheus Variants
The first encountered Prometheus sample, first observed in February 2021 (SHA256:
9bf0633f41d2962ba5e2895ece2ef9fa7b546ada311ca30f330f0d261a7fb184), behaves
similarly to the more recent variant we are currently tracking. However, it appends the
following extension to the encrypted files: .PROM[prometheushelp@mail[.]ch].
Some of the observed samples, when executed, opened a Windows Command Shell
showing the encryption progress (Figure 9). The most recent Prometheus samples do not
display this information.

Another variant (SHA256:
11aebdff8c064c160c2b21f3a844bacaecd581d9dc2e4224d31903d2a56e2dd3) appended the
.XXXXXXXXXX[prometheusdec@yahoo[.]com] extension format to encrypted files where the
X is the victim ID. Like the current variant, it generates two ransom note files. The ransom
note includes two ways to contact the group that are different from those offered by the
current variant (Figure 10). Based on the content and instructions provided by this variant,
we believe Prometheus didn’t have a leak site established at the time they distributed it.

10/14

Figure 10. RESTORE_FILES_INFO.hta (as sent by an older Prometheus variant).
Instead of directing the victim to the leak site as the current variant does, the older variant of
Prometheus instructs the victim to go to a Tor site called Sonar, a web-based messaging
service, and create an account. After the account is created, the ransom note instructs the
11/14

victim to send a message to the username Prometheus, containing the file extension
identifier and a link to three encrypted files to provide proof of decryption. The second
method of contact is through email and includes three email addresses for contact,
requesting the same information as the first method.
This helps us understand how the Prometheus ransomware group originally operated and
shows the evolution of their approach to securing payment before deciding to start their own
leak site.

Conclusion
Prometheus is a new and emerging ransomware gang that uses a personalized variant of
Thanos ransomware. The operators behind this ransomware are actively targeting multiple
industries globally. Like many other ransomware groups, Prometheus hosts a leak site to
create additional pressure and shame victims into paying the ransom. While Prometheus
claims to be part of the REvil ransomware gang, during our research, we didn’t find a solid
connection between the two ransomware groups at the time of writing this report.
