Background
Data exfiltration exists as a cornerstone of malicious cyber operations. Yet the nature of
exfiltration and its impact changed significantly over the past few years.
Historically, adversaries linked to state sponsors or similar activities would engage in data
theft to further goals of industrial espionage or intellectual property theft. More recently,
adversaries have engaged in exfiltration, not based on the value of the data to themselves or

1/7

their sponsors, but rather on the desire of victims to not have such data exposed. The result
is an ecosystem of exfiltration and disclosure for either monetary or “hacktivist” purposes,
where the malicious party seeks to damage (or threaten damage) to the victim. Relevant,
recent examples include ransomware-related data loss at meat processor JBS, which
prompted to company to pay $11 million to avoid disclosure of data, and an intrusion at
gaming company Electronic Arts resulting in the loss and potential sale of nearly 800
gigabytes of sensitive information. Given these trends, network owners, operators, and
defenders must work to ensure controls are in place to detect, mitigate, or outright block
such activity given potential costs.

Exfiltration Impacts
On its face, exfiltration appears less concerning than other cyber-nexus impacts such as
network disruption. While data exfiltration typically has some immediate impact on an
organization, long-term hazards may make loss of sensitive data even more destructive than
an especially virulent ransomware incident.

Figure 1: The three primary impacts of data exfiltration.
As illustrated above, three primary risks adhere to data loss or exfiltration events:
Loss of sensitive data or intellectual property, which can place an organization at a
competitive disadvantage or even induce regulatory risk in the case of sensitive
customer or client data
Damage to an organization’s reputation following a publicized incident, including but
not limited to public relations work to reduce impacts and long-term association with a
major, high-profile data loss event
Opening up the organization to extortion by actors who extract data, then threaten to
publish it absent payment or some other action
The first case constitutes the typical focus of data loss concern, as this relates to incidents
ranging from state-sponsored industrial espionage to criminal entities attempting to steal
banking or personal information. The second adheres to all (publicly revealed or
acknowledged) exfiltration incidents, and forms a difficult-to-quantify cost that may take years

2/7

to overcome. The third is a relatively recent development that aligns with emerging trends in
“double-extortion” ransomware and similar criminal activity, although such tactics possess a
longer history among politically motivated hacktivist entities.
Overall, while risks are significant, their quantification and time to manifestation are typically
unclear, making these items hard to assess. Theft of intellectual property may have impacts
felt only years (or decades) after the action takes place, while potential reputational losses
may be impossible to adequately quantify under any circumstance. Yet given an increase in
both hacktivist and especially ransomware operations incorporating data leak or data
extortion activities, data exfiltration activity is rapidly becoming a more acute and immediate
issue than in years past. Thus, network defenders and operators must align defenses in such
a fashion to identify and potentially even prevent such activity where appropriate.

Identifying Exfiltration Behaviors
Exfiltration activity would be expected to be noisy and relatively easy to spot, given the
movement of large amounts of data to new or unfamiliar sources. Yet even making this
determination requires a combination of network visibility and active network monitoring such
that most organizations either lack insight into such behaviors, or such activities blend in
sufficiently with legitimate activity so as to produce significant “noise” in detections.
Furthermore, adversaries of various types employ multiple techniques to minimize visibility
and evade detection, either through obfuscation or blending in with other actions. Examples
include:
Using legitimate third-party services, such as cloud backup systems or web-based
storage, as destinations for leaked data. Examples range from common items such as
Google Drive and Dropbox to more specialized products such as an ecosystem of
items related to the Mega.io service.
Tunneling traffic over non-HTTP services or using alternative protocols for large data
transfer that might not be monitored with the same level of scrutiny.
Dividing data into smaller pieces for exfiltration to avoid abnormally large traffic flows
leaving the network.
Although all of these are concerning, none is impossible to detect. Rather, defenders can
employ a combination of monitoring for more general traffic pattern anomalies along with
specific identification of certain techniques or behaviors to detect this type of activity. Even in
cases where data is encoded or encrypted, or where visibility into network activity is
somewhat limited, access to datasets such as network flow provides a number of
possibilities to flag suspicious operations.
At the most general level, identification of suspicious network flows represents a potentially
powerful technique for identifying exfiltration activity. Aside from just looking for large data
flows, with “large” likely dependent upon the normal operations and expectations within the
3/7

monitored network, identification of directionality and upload/download ratios are necessary
enrichments to accurately leverage flow monitoring. For example, a “large” flow may just be
indicative of a long-running, data-rich connection such as streaming, remote access, or
related activity. However, when also looking at directionality and data ratios, identifying large
flows where the majority of data (80–90 percent) leaves the network can flag a large upload
session. While there may certainly be legitimate use cases for such activity, such as sharing
large project files or datasets, these flows may also be indicative of data loss or other
unauthorized activity.
The above becomes even more powerful when combined with an analytic approach to
network connections. Identifying not just anomalous, outbound flows but connecting these to
new, previously unobserved or suspicious network infrastructure enables powerful detection
possibilities. For example, linking a suspicious outbound flow to new network infrastructure
or a virtual private server (VPS) instance (such as Linode, DigitalOcean, or a similar
provider) can identify activity of concern. Extending further, the same logic can also be
applied to nonstandard connections (like external FTP or other protocols) to unknown or
untrusted destinations to identify potential exfiltration activity.
While these strategies are effective in identifying when an exfiltration event occurs, they are
lacking in that such approaches are fundamentally “backward looking.” In other words, these
items will identify exfiltration as or shortly after it actually takes place. This can be of value to
alert organizations that something is wrong, thus enabling response and mitigation
operations and reducing time to detection and time to response metrics. Yet ideally
defenders and their respective employers would be able to prevent exfiltration from taking
place at all.

Applying “Whole of Kill Chain” Defense
Preventing exfiltration requires a “whole of Cyber Kill Chain” perspective with respect to
network monitoring and defense. In this scenario, defenders look for overall adversary
intrusion pathways and dependencies to identify necessary precursors (initial access, lateral
movement, data collection, and data staging) prior to data leaving the network.

Figure 2: Threat intrusion pathways and points of defender intervention to detect or defeat
attacks.
Through a critical examination of what an adversary requires to succeed, we can begin
implementing more general controls across both host and network capabilities to defeat not
just exfiltration operations but a variety of intrusions. At minimum, identifying likely adversary
ingress mechanisms and either monitoring them closely or implementing controls to reduce
attack surface can significantly reduce the likelihood of a threat actor gaining access to the
environment. Relevant controls include patching external-facing systems, reducing available
services from external access, limiting traffic types inbound to the network, and monitoring
sensitive activity such as remote administration or access sessions.
Many organizations focus on these steps as a means to reduce risk, but true, layered
defense requires going beyond the network boundary to ensure coverage across subsequent
adversary actions as well. Given a near-infinite number of possible initial access
mechanisms available to adversaries, as well as the possibility of subverting systems or
users even when items are patched or otherwise monitored, defense must extend into
internal network traffic flows and host items. Defenders must identify lateral movement
techniques and their artifacts across both network and host behaviors. While increasing
adoption of endpoint defense and response (EDR) products covers host-centric
observations, investment in East-West traffic visibility and monitoring is essential to capture
adversary traversal of defended networks. Implemented together, these items can ensure
coverage of adversary operations ranging from opportunistic criminal actors to focused
hacktivists to state-sponsored threats.

5/7

Overall, defenders need to combine an understanding of adversary behaviors and
tendencies (such as through production or ingestion of cyber threat intelligence) to first
determine how adversaries operate and what techniques are relevant in intrusion operations.
Once determined, a combination of EDR and network defense and response (NDR) must be
employed to ensure layered detection and monitoring and cover any potential gaps in
visibility that adversaries may attempt to use to their advantage.

Conclusion
Data exfiltration is increasingly incorporated into the actions of a variety of threats, from
criminals to hacktivists to state-directed intrusions. Through the application and monitoring of
robust network controls, defenders and asset owners can ensure awareness of such
behaviors when they occur, allowing for quicker response and potentially event mitigation.
Defenders cannot focus solely on detecting anomalous outbound data flows. Instead, robust
defense requires identifying adversary actions across all phases of intrusion operations.
Once understood, defenders can implement network and host controls or visibility to cover
each step of an intrusion. Only through this robust, defense-in-depth approach can
defenders ensure not just awareness of potential malicious activity (including but not limited
to data exfiltration operations), but also enable possible intrusion interdiction or disruption
when actions are caught early in the adversary’s lifecycle. While neither easy nor
inexpensive, defense against modern cyber threats, from ransomware operations to data
exfiltration for a variety of purposes, demands such investment to ensure defenders keep
pace with a rapidly evolving threat landscape.
