Executive Summary
We have confirmed that the Kimsuky group is distributing malware using a malicious
OneNote (.ONE) file, which cybercriminals have widely used.
When viewed, the ONE file displays an image of the and asks the target to fill out a
privacy agreement document in order to pay them for participating in a survey.
The HWP file is a simple image, not a real attachment, and double-clicking on its
location executes a malicious VBS script hidden behind the image to download
additional malware.
While the final payload is unavailable, the Kimsuky group is believed to be behind this
malicious OneNote campaign due to the parameters the group has used to distribute
the malware and its fake email disguised as a form of compensation.

Technical Details
On March 17, 2023, a OneNote file containing a malicious script was uploaded on Virustotal
impersonating the Institute for Peace and Democracy at Korea University. The file was
submitted from South Korea. The OneNote file asks survey participants to fill out a hangul
word processor(.HWP) document (Personal Information Use Agreement) in order to receive
recompense. To do this, the image contains a .hwp file icon and file name disguised as a
download, and the user is encouraged to double-click it. The double-click triggers the
execution of a malicious VBS file hidden behind the image, which then downloads additional
malware from an external server.
Figure 1. The image is seen when opening OneNote
When the image is moved as shown below, the VBS file icon appears behind it, and the
previously known exploitation method of OneNote is applied in the same way. At this time,
the same VBS files are arranged in a row, which is to ensure that the VBS file is executed
even if the victim presses any part of the file.
Figure 2. Malicious VBS scripts behind the image
When the script is executed, the obfuscated code is executed and additional files are
downloaded from the address below. No additional downloads were made at the time of
analysis. The downloaded HWP file will be stored in the Downloads
path(%Userprofile%\Downloads\personal.hwp), which is presumed to be a normal document
to appear as if the target downloads the document normally.

In addition to downloading additional files, access specific registries and change values as
shown below.

HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main => no => 1
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Edge\IEToEdge => 0
The Kimsuky group has been distributing malware by sending phishing e-mails containing
false compensation for several years. The image in OneNote discovered this time also deals
with the same theme. In addition, the URL that the VBS script requests to download is the
same as the address format used when distributing the Babyshark malware, and the hosting
server that the Kimsuky group frequently uses is used for the same purpose.
Address format has been used by the Kimsuky group: hxxp[:]//[URL]/
This URL format has already been disclosed in the past and has been attributed to the
Kimsuky group.
In addition, the server that downloads the additional malware resolves to 185.176.43[.]98,
which the Kimsuky group has been using continuously.

Conclusion
We’ve seen a number of recent cases of cybercrime-related malware such as Qakbot,
Redline Stealer, and AsyncRAT being distributed by attaching malicious OneNote files
to emails, but this is the first time we’ve seen it utilized by an APT group from North
Korea.
However, there is a possibility that it is a test stage before full-scale use in that a
number of strings “ were confirmed in the script.
Microsoft mentioned on March 10th that they will introduce an option for embedded
files to prevent malware infection due to malicious OneNote files, and it is highly likely
that the Kimsuky group will be used as a new distribution method until the introduction.
In order to prevent malware infection from malicious OneNote, if a suspicious OneNote
file is attached to an e-mail received from outside, care must be taken not to open the
file.
