Fresh TOTOLINK Vulnerabilities Picked Up by Beastmode
Mirai Campaign
fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/totolink-vulnerabilities-beastmode-mirai-campaign
April 1, 2022

Between February and March 2022, our FortiGuard Labs team observed that the Beastmode
(aka B3astmode) Mirai-based DDoS campaign has aggressively updated its arsenal of
exploits. Five new exploits were added within a month, with three targeting various models of
TOTOLINK routers.
This inclusion of TOTOLINK exploits is especially noteworthy as they were added just a
week after the exploit codes were published on GitHub. We previously reported on the
MANGA campaign, which similarly adopted exploit code within weeks of their release.
By rapidly adopting newly released exploit code, threat actors can potentially infect
vulnerable devices and expand their botnets before patches are applied to fix these
vulnerabilities.

TOTOLINK has already released updated firmware for affected models and users are
strongly encouraged to update their devices.
This post details how this threat leverages these vulnerabilities to control affected devices,
and ways to protect users from these attacks.
Affected Platforms: Linux
Impacted Users: Any organization
Impact: Remote attackers gain control of the vulnerable systems
Severity Level: Critical

Exploiting New Vulnerabilities
The Beastmode campaign derives its name from filenames and URLs used for its binary
samples (Figure 1), as well as a unique HTTP User-Agent header "b3astmode" (Figure 2)
within the exploit requests. Binary samples are based on the publicly available source code
of the Mirai botnet.

filenames and URLs
Like most DDOS botnets, aside from brute-forcing credentials, Beastmode employs a variety
of exploits to infect more devices, as listed below.
CVE-2022-26210 targets TOTOLINK A800R, A810R, A830R, A950RG, A3000RU, and
A3100R (Figure 2).

CVE-2022-26186 targets TOTOLINK N600R and A7100RU (Figure 3).
Figure 3. CVE-2022-26186 exploit request
CVE-2022-25075/25076/25077/25078/25079/25080/25081/25082/25083/25084 are a family
of similar vulnerabilities targeting TOTOLINK A810R, A830R, A860R, A950RG, A3100R,
A3600R, T6, and T10 routers. (Figure 4).
Interestingly, the samples caught on 20 Feb 2022 contained a typo in the URL, where
“downloadFile.cgi” was used instead of “downloadFlile.cgi” used by the devices. This had
been fixed in samples captured three days later, suggesting active development and
operation of this campaign.

Apart from TOTOLINK products, this campaign also targets discontinued D-Link products
(DIR-810L, DIR-820L/LW, DIR-826L, DIR-830L and DIR-836L) via CVE-2021-45382
(Figure 5). Note that updated firmware is not available as these products have reached their
end of life/support cycles.

It is interesting to note that this campaign also attempts to exploit CVE-2021-4045 (Figure 6),
a vulnerability for the TP-Link Tapo C200 IP camera, which we have not observed in other
Mirai-based campaigns. While the current implementation of the exploit is incorrect, device
owners should still update their camera firmware to fix this vulnerability.

A couple of older vulnerabilities were also found in the samples analyzed by FortiGuard Labs
researchers, namely CVE-2017-17215 (Figure 7) targeting Huawei HG532 routers, and
CVE-2016-5674 (Figure 8) targeting NUUO NVRmini2, NVRsolo, Crystal Devices, and
NETGEAR ReadyNAS Surveillance products.

Figure 8. CVE-2016-5674 exploit request
While affecting a variety of products, these vulnerabilities are all similar in that they allow
threat actors to inject commands to be executed after successful exploitation. This usually
involves using the wget command to download shell scripts to infect the device with
Beastmode.
In addition, exploits lead to slightly different shell scripts. Snippets of the scripts downloaded
from the successful exploitation of CVE-2021-45382, CVE-2022-26186, and CVE-202225075, respectively are shown below (Figure 9).
Figure 9. Executing Beastmode with different filenames and parameters
As shown in the above figure, each script downloads the same file to different filenames but
is executed with different parameters.
For instance, successful exploitation of CVE-2021-45382, a vulnerability involving a function
named “DDNS” within D-Link router firmware, leads to the download and execution (Figure
5) of the shell script “ddns.sh”. Then, as shown in Figure 9, the script then downloads the
Beastmode binary, which is saved as “ddns” and executed with the “ddns.exploit” parameter.
The parameter (highlighted in blue) allows the infected device to register itself as part of the
“ddns.exploit” sub-group within the botnet. It could then be used by the botnet operators to
assess the viability of specific exploits by measuring the number of bots or simply for ease of
management.

Once devices are infected by Beastmode, the botnet can be used by its operators to
perform a variety of DDoS attacks commonly found in other Mirai-based botnets, including:
attack_app_http
attack_tcp_ack
attack_tcp_syn
attack_udp_plain
attack_udp_vse
attack_udp_ovhhex
attack_udp_stdhex
attack_udp_CLAMP

Conclusion
Even though the original Mirai author was arrested in fall 2018, this article highlights how
threat actors, such as those behind the Beastmode campaign, continue to rapidly incorporate
newly published exploit code to infect unpatched devices using the Mirai malware.
By continuously monitoring the evolving threat landscape, FortiGuard Labs researchers
identify new vulnerabilities exploited by Mirai variants and malware targeting IoT devices to
bring greater awareness to such threats and better secure our customers’ networks.

Fortinet Protections
Fortinet customers are protected by the following:
The following generic FortiGuard IPS signatures detect exploitation attempts from
Beastmode and other Mirai-based botnets:
Mirai.Botnet
HTTP.Unix.Shell.IFS.Remote.Code.Execution
FortiGuard Labs also provides IPS signatures against the following vulnerabilities.
CVE-2017-17215 - Huawei.HG532.Remote.Code.Execution
CVE-2016-5674 NUUO.Surveillance.Application.UNAUTH.Remote.Code.Execution
The FortiGuard Web Filtering Service blocks downloaded URLs and identified C2s.
The FortiGuard AntiVirus service detects and blocks this threat as Linux/Mirai and
ELF/Mirai
FortiGuard IP Reputation & Anti-Botnet Security Service proactively blocks these attacks by
aggregating malicious source IP data from the Fortinet distributed network of threat sensors,
CERTs, MITRE, cooperative competitors, and other global sources that collaborate to
provide up-to-date threat intelligence about hostile sources.
