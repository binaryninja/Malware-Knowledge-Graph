I keep on my hunting of Goblin Panda and I’ve just found two new country targeted by
them: Cambodia and South Korea.
This post deals with only the Cambodia
The first document
9d0c4ec62abe79e754eaa2fd7696f98441bc783781d8656065cddfae3dbf503e is a rtf and
uses the same technics to drop on disk a legit file
77361b1ca09d6857d68cea052a0bb857e03d776d3e1943897315a80a19f20fc2 and a new
core RAT. 4a5bf0df9ee222dac87e2f1b38b18660ebb92de8ba3f1cbc845f945a766dd6a6.
This file is a dll. You found a complete analysis by Fortinet.
https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/rehashed-rat-used-in-apt-campaign-againstvietnamese-organizations.html
The c2 that is contacted by the dll is weather.gbaycruise.com has the same IP used during
the Vietnamese campaign 103.193.4.106. This IP has many overlaps with domains using
another IP 103.193.4.115 used by the Vietnamese campaign.

And like Vietnamese, it’s the exploit toolset and drops the same rat.
Another things very interesting,all domains are provided by NAMECHEAP INC. and used
the same NS server.
