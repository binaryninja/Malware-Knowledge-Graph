Intro
Yesterday at a virtual edition of OPCDE Juan Andrés Guerrero-Saade disclosed to the world
part of his research on threat groups listed in Lost in Translation , a leak of Equation
Group tools done by Shadowbrokers in 2017. Shortly after he published an analysis on his
blog and shared hashes. During the talk Juan mentioned that he doesn’t really know what
the piece of malware, belonging to Nazar APT, actually does so we put some time to find out.

is a main part of the backdoor and its the one we took a look at. This a passive backdoor that
relies on, now discontinued, Packet Sniffer SDK (PSSDK) from Microolap. We wont go into
details of communication and how packets from and to c2 are build, this will be a subject of
following posts. Instead we will present capabilities of this malware. All magic is happening in
00404F10h where we can find a big if-else tree with various commands id.
