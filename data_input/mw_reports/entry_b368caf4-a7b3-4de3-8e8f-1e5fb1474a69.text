Members of the cybersecurity community at large know that learning opportunities present
themselves every day. The purpose behind this investigative anecdote on the “water
watering hole” is educational and highlights how sometimes two intrusions just don’t line up
together no matter how much coincidence there is. We hope you will agree after reading
this that intelligence and intrusion analysis are not always what they seem.
Our story begins in Oldsmar, Florida, on Monday, 08 February 2021, when the Pinellas
County Sheriff held a press conference. The sheriff, Oldsmar mayor, and city
manager described a water poisoning attempt at the city’s water treatment plant the
previous Friday. This unprecedented event made both a stir in the media
and among Dragos’s team of adversary hunters.

A Water Watering HoleIs Discovered
During our investigation into the infamous water poisoning attempt against the citizens of
Oldsmar, Dragos discovered a Florida water utility contractor hosting malicious code on
their website (i.e., a watering hole). This malicious code seemingly targeted water utilities,
particularly in Florida, and more importantly, was visited by a browser from the city of
Oldsmar on the same day of the poisoning event.

The adversary inserted the malicious code into the footer file (Figure 2) of the WordPressbased site associated with a Florida water infrastructure construction company. The
adversary possibly exploited one of the multiple vulnerable WordPress plugins that Dragos
determined were in use on the site at the time of compromise.

site xxxxxxxxxxxxxx[.]com

A Snapshot of the Malicious Data Gathering Campaign
This malicious data gathering campaign affected computer systems that browsed the
compromised, but otherwise legitimate, website during a 58-day window beginning 20
December 2020. Dragos assisted with malicious code identification and initial remediation
of the compromised website on 16 February 2021. Those who interacted with the malicious
code included computers from municipal water utility customers, state and local government
agencies, various water industry-related private companies, and normal internet bot and
website crawler traffic. Over 1000 end-user computers were profiled by the malicious code
during that time, mostly from within the United States and the State of Florida, as shown in
Figure 3.

Using telemetry from Team Cymru Pure Signal Recon, Dragos determined that a user on a
computer system on a network belonging to the City of Oldsmar browsed the compromised
site at exactly 14:49 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), or 9:49 am on 05 February 2021.
This is the same network where an unknown actor reportedly compromised a water
treatment control plant computer on the morning of 05 February and attempted to poison
the water supply using the computer system’s Human Machine Interface (HMI).
Based on these initial facts Dragos released an Advisory Alert on 17 February 2021 to
customers informing them of the watering hole potentially targeting water utilities along with
defensive guidance and indicators. The purpose of an Advisory Alert is to ensure
customers receive and can act on timely intelligence when the entire story is not yet known.
We also shared our insights with our partners at the Department of Homeland Security
(DHS) so they could perform victim notifications if they deemed it important.
After the Advisory Alert Dragos went to work uncovering and exposing the entire threat.

Deciphering the Malicious Fingerprinting Script
Dragos reverse-engineered the fingerprinting script and determined it used code from four
different code projects: core-js, UAParser, regeneratorRuntime, and a data collection script
only observed elsewhere on two websites (website 1, website 2) associated with a domain
registration, hosting, and web development company.

The fingerprinting script gathered over 100 elements of detailed information about the
visitors including the following:
Operating system and CPU
Browser, including available languages
Touch points, input methods, presence of camera, accelerometer, microphone
Video card display adapter details, and
Time zone, geolocation, video codecs, screen dimensions, browser plugins
The script also directed the visiting browser to two separate browser cipher fingerprinting
sites to collect cipher fingerprint hashes: TLS fingerprint, JA SSL Fingerprint. Various
network defense regimes typically compute browser cipher fingerprinting such as JA3 (done
by ja3er[.]com, for example) to detect connections from malware-infected hosts and discern
hostile connections from legitimate browser client traffic. Once all this data was collected in
the browser memory, the JavaScript code sent the data via Hypertext Transfer Protocol
(HTTP) POSTs to a database on the same Heroku app site that hosted the script,
bdatac.herokuapp[.]com. This Heroku app was taken down after notification from Dragos.
Dragos found exactly one other internet site that hosted this complex code and served it to
visiting internet browsers, DarkTeam Store. DarkTeam Store claims to be a dark market that
supplies thousands of customers with gift cards and accounts (Figure 4).

Additional analysis of data obtained by Dragos revealed that at least a portion of this site
may not actually be a dark market, but rather a check-in place for systems infected with a
recent variant of botnet malware known as Tofsee. Dragos found evidence showing that the
DarkTeam store and the water infrastructure construction company website were subverted
by the same actor on the same day (20 December 2020). Dragos observed 12,735 IP
addresses representing likely Tofsee-infected systems worldwide employing 271 unique
user agents. These clients connected to a non-public (i.e., requiring authentication) page
(httpx://darkteam[.]store/dogs/Home-2.html) of the DarkTeam site and presented a browser
user agent string with a peculiar “Tesseract/1.0” artifact (Figure 5).

Improving Botnets to Impersonate Legitimate Browser Activity
This bot check-in routine for JA3 cipher fingerprinting may be the Tofsee malware author’s
response to network defense techniques used to detect previous iterations of Tofsee botnet
malware with a characteristic JA3 hash. Dragos performed forensic log analysis and
identified three JA3 hashes unique to this new Tofsee botnet that Dragos calls “Tesseract.”
Dragos also obtained other JA3 hashes from an industry partner that observed connections
from this botnet. Some of these JA3 hashes are also associated with legitimate browsers.
Dragos focuses solely on ICS cybersecurity, but as we obtain detailed intelligence on this
threat from our investigation, we share indicators to facilitate botnet detection.
With the forensic information we collected so far, Dragos’s best assessment is that an actor
deployed the watering hole on the water infrastructure construction company site to collect
legitimate browser data for the purpose of improving the botnet malware’s ability to
impersonate legitimate web browser activity. The botnet’s use of at least ten different cipher
handshakes or JA3 hashes, some of which mimic legitimate browsers, compared to the
widely published hash of a single handshake of a previous Tofsee bot iteration is evidence
of botnet improvement.

In Summary
We do not understand why the adversary chose this specific Florida water construction
company site to compromise and to host their code. Interestingly, and unlike other watering
hole attacks, the code did not deliver exploits or attempt to achieve access to victim
computers. It is possible the actor believed that the water infrastructure construction
website would allow more dwell time to collect data important for the actor’s objectives, than
perhaps a busier but more closely monitored website with a dedicated security team.
Several elements early in our investigation suggested a highly potent and dangerous threat
to water utilities:
Florida-focused watering hole
Temporal correlation to Oldsmar event
Highly encoded and sophisticated JavaScript
Few code locations on the internet
Known ICS-targeting activity groups use watering holes as initial access including:
DYMALLOY, ALLANITE, and RASPITE
Further investigation revealed a less ominous threat but provided an excellent lesson in
alerting the industry early to potential threats while continuing the investigation until the full
scope and intent of the events can be understood.
This is not a typical watering hole. We have medium confidence it did not directly
compromise any organization. But it does represent an exposure risk to the water industry
and highlights the importance of controlling access to untrusted websites, especially for
Operational Technology (OT) and Industrial Control System (ICS) environments.
