Introduction
The Russian­language cybercrime market is known all
over the world. By ‘Russian­language market’ we mean
cybercriminals who are citizens of the Russian Federation
and some former USSR countries, predominantly Ukraine
and the Baltic states. Why is this market known
worldwide? There are two main factors: the first of these is
frequent global media coverage of the activity of Russian­
language cybercriminals. The second is the open
accessibility of online platforms used by the cybercriminal
community for communications, promoting a variety of
“services” and “products” and discussing their quality and
methods of application, if not for making actual deals.

Over time, the range of “products” and “services” available
through this underground market has evolved, becoming
more focused on financial attacks, and with an ever­
increasing level of sophistication. One of the most
common types of cybercrime was (and still is) the turnover
of stolen payment card data. With the emergence of online
stores and other services involving e­payment

transactions, DDoS­attacks and financial cybercrime have
become especially popular with the fraudsters whose main
targets are users’ payment data or the theft of money
directly from user accounts or companies.

Attacks on users’ and companies’ e­wallets were initiated
by the Trojan ibank in 2006; then came ZeuS (2007) and
SpyEye (2009) followed by the groups Carberp (2010) and
Carbanak (2013). And this list is incomplete; there are
more Trojans out there, used by criminals to steal users’
money and data.

With online financial transactions becoming more
common, the organizations supporting such operations
are becoming more attractive to cybercriminals. Over the
last few years, cybercriminals have been increasingly
attacking not just the customers of banks and online
stores, but the enabling banks and payments systems
directly. The story of the Carbanak cybergroup which
specializes in attacking banks and was exposed earlier
this year by Kaspersky Lab is a clear confirmation of this
trend.
Kaspersky Lab experts have been monitoring the Russian
hacker underground since it first emerged. Kaspersky Lab
regularly issues reports on financial cyber­threats which
track changes in the number of financial malware attacks
carried out over time. Information on the number of
attacks may indicate the extent of the problem but does
not reveal anything about who creates them and how. We
hope that our review will help to shed light on this aspect
of financial cybercrime.

The data presented in this article is compiled from dozens
of investigations that Kaspersky Lab experts have
participated in over the last few years, as well as their
many years’ experience observing the Russian cybercrime
market.

Situation overview
According to Kaspersky Lab, between 2012 and 2015, law
enforcement agencies from a number of different
countries, including the United States, Russia, Belarus,
Ukraine and the EU arrested over 160 Russian­speaking
cybercriminals who were members of small, medium­sized
and large criminal groups. They were all suspected of
being engaged in stealing money using malware. The total
damage resulting from their worldwide activity exceeded
$790 million dollars. (This estimate is based both on the
analysis of public information about the arrests of people
suspected of committing financial cybercrime in the period
between 2012 and 2015 and on Kaspersky Lab’s own
data.) Of this sum, about $509 million dollars was stolen
outside the borders of the former USSR. Of course, this
figure only includes confirmed losses, the details of which
were obtained by law enforcement authorities during the
investigation. In reality, cybercriminals could have stolen a
much larger amount.

The number of arrests of Russian­speaking
cybercriminals as officially announced during the
period 2012 to 2015

Since 2013, Kaspersky Lab’s Computer Incidents
Investigation team has participated in the investigation of
more than 330 cybersecurity incidents. More than 95% of
these were connected with the theft of money or financial
information.

Although the number of arrests of Russian­language
criminals suspected of financial cybercrime increased
significantly in 2015 compared with the previous year, the
cybercriminal market is still “crowded.” According to
Kaspersky Lab experts, over the last three years Russian­
language cybercrime has recruited up to a thousand
people. These include people involved in the creation of
infrastructure, and writing and distributing malware code to
steal money, as well as those who either stole or cashed
the stolen money. Most of those arrested are still not in
prison.

We can calculate fairly precisely the number of people
who make up the core structure of an active criminal
group: the organizers, the money flow managers involved
in withdrawing money from compromised accounts and
the professional hackers. Across the cybercriminal
underground, there are only around 20 of these core
professionals. They are regular visitors of underground
forums, and Kaspersky Lab experts have collected a
considerable amount of information that suggests that
these 20 people play leading roles in criminal activities
that involve the online theft of money and information.
The exact number of groups operating across Russia and
its neighboring countries is unknown: many of those
involved in criminal activities participate in several thefts
and then, for various reasons cease their activity. Some
participants of known but apparently disbanded groups
continue their criminal activities as part of new groups.

Kaspersky Lab’s Computer Incidents Investigation
Department can now confirm the activity of at least five
major cybercriminal groups specializing in financial
crimes. These are the groups whose activities have been
monitored by the company’s experts over the last few
years.

All five groups came to the attention of the company’s
experts in 2012­2013, and are still active. They each
number between ten and 40 people. At least two of them
are actively attacking targets not only in Russia but also in
the USA, the UK, Australia, France, Italy and Germany.

Since the investigation into these groups has not been
completed, it is not possible to publish more detailed
information on the activities of these groups. Kaspersky
Lab continues to investigate their activity and is
cooperating with the law enforcement agencies of Russia
and other countries in order to curb their cybercriminal
business.

Investigation into the activities of these groups has
allowed Kaspersky Lab experts to form an idea about their
methods of operation and the structure of the
cybercriminal market.

The structure of the Russianlanguage cybercriminal
market
“A Range of products and services”
The cybercriminal market usually comprises a set of
“services” and “products”, used for various illegal actions
in cyberspace. These “products” and “services” are
offered to users of dedicated online communities, most of
which are closed to outsiders.

https://securelist.com/analysis/publications/72782/russian-financial-cybercrime-how-it-works/

Russian financial cybercrime: how it works - Securelist

The “products” include:

Software designed to gain unauthorized access to a
computer or a mobile device, in order to steal data
from an infected device or money from a victim’s
account (the Trojans);
Software designed to take advantage of vulnerabilities
in the software installed on a victim’s computer
(exploits);
Databases of stolen credit card data and other
valuable information;
Internet traffic (a certain number of visits to a
customer­selected site by users with a specific profile.)
The “services” include:

Spam distribution;
Organization of DDoS attacks (overloading sites with
requests in order to make them unavailable to
legitimate users);
Testing malware for antivirus detection;
“Packing” of malware (changing malicious software
with the help of special software (packers) so that it is
not detected by antivirus software);
Renting out exploit packs;
Renting out dedicated servers;
VPN (providing anonymous access to web resources,
protection of the data exchange);
Renting out abuse­resistant hosting (hosting that does
not respond to complaints about malicious content,
and therefore does not disable the server);
Renting out botnets;
Evaluation of the stolen credit card data;
Services to validate the data (fake calls, fake
document scans);
Promotion of malicious and advertising sites in search
results (Black SEO);
Mediation of transactions for the acquisition of
“products” and “services”;
Withdrawal of money and cashing.
Payments for such “products” and “services” on the
cybercriminal market are generally made via an e­
payment system such as WebMoney, Perfect Money,
https://securelist.com/analysis/publications/72782/russian-financial-cybercrime-how-it-works/

6/28

2015/11/24

Bitcoin and others.
All of these “products” and “services” are bought and sold
in various combinations in order to enable four main types
of crime. These types can also be combined in various
ways depending on the criminal group:

DDoS attacks (ordered or carried out for the purpose
of extortion);
Theft of personal information and data to access e­
money (for the purpose of resale or money theft);
Theft of money from the accounts of banks or other
organizations;
Domestic or corporate espionage;
Blocking access to data on the infected computer for
the purpose of extortion;
According to Kaspersky Lab experts, the theft of money is
currently the most widespread type of crime. The rest of
this report therefore focuses on this segment of the
Russian­language cybercrime market.

The “labor market” of ﬁnancial
cybercrime
The variety of skills required for the creation of “products”
and the provision of “services” has given rise to a unique
labor market of professionals involved in financial
cybercrime.
The list of key roles is almost exactly the same as that
seen in any IT­related company:

Programmers / encoders / virus writers (for the
creation of new malicious software and modification of
existing malware);
Web designers (for the creation of phishing pages,
emails, etc.);
System administrators (for the construction and
support of the IT infrastructure);
Testers (to test the malicious software);
“Cryptors” (responsible for the packing of malicious

code to bypass antivirus detection).
The list does not include the heads of the criminal groups,
the money flow managers engaged in withdrawing money
from compromised accounts, and the heads of money
mules supervising the process of cashing the stolen
money. This is because the relationship between these
elements of the criminal groups is not an employer­
employee one, but more of a partnership.

Depending on the type and extent of the criminal
enterprise, the heads of the groups either employ “staff”
and pay them a fixed salary or work with them on a
freelance basis paying for a particular project.

An offer of employment posted on a semi­closed forum inviting a
programmer to join a cybercriminal group. The job requirements
include experience in writing complex bots.

“Employees” are recruited either via sites where those
involved in criminal activity traditionally gather or via
resources for those interested in non­standard ways of
making money online. In some cases, the ads are placed
on mainstream job search sites or on the labor exchanges
for remote employees.

We can confirm
the activity of at
least 5 major
cybercriminal
groups
specializing in
financial crimes

In general, employees involved in cybercrime can be
divided into two types: those who are aware of the
illegality of the project or the work they are offered, and
those who (at least in the beginning) know nothing about
it. In the latter case, these are usually people performing
relatively simple operations such as copying the interface
of banking systems and sites.

By advertising “real” job vacancies, cybercriminals often
expect to find employees from the remote regions of
Russia and neighboring countries (mostly Ukraine) where
problems with employment opportunities and salaries for
IT specialists are quite severe.

A fraudster has advertised a job vacancy for java / flash specialists
on a popular Ukrainian website. The job requirements include a
good level of programming skills in Java, Flash, knowledge of JVM /
AVM specifications, and others. The organizer offers remote work
and full employment with a salary of $2,500.

The idea of searching for “employees” in these regions is
simple – they carry a saving because staff can be paid
less than employees based in large cities. Criminals also
often give preference to candidates who have not
previously been involved in cybercrime activity.

Often, such job offers are presented as legitimate work,
with the true purpose of the work only becoming clear
once the task is received.

In this example, the organizer of the criminal group offers a job to a
javascript programmer, masking it under a vacancy at a “Web­
innovation studio specializing in the development of highly
sophisticated Internet applications.”

In the case of illegal job search sites, less­experienced
candidates are expected.

This vacancy invites a C ++ developer to develop “custom”
software. In this context “custom” software means malicious
software.

The second reason in favor of remote “personnel” is the
organizer’s aim of making the activity of the group as
anonymous as possible, and to ensure that no single
contractor possesses complete information about the
group.

Options for organizing a criminal
group
Criminal groups involved in stealing money or financial
information that will enable them to get access to money,
differ in the number of participants and scope of activities.
There are three main types of involvement:

Affiliate programs
Single dealers, small and middle­sized groups (up to
ten members)
Large organized groups (ten or more participants)
This division is nominal. The scale of the group’s activity
depends on the skillfulness of its participants, their
ambition and the overall level of organizational abilities. In
some cases, Kaspersky Lab experts came across
relatively small criminal groups performing tasks that
usually require a greater number of participants.

Aﬃliate programs
Affiliate programs are the easiest and least expensive
method of getting involved in cybercrime activities. The
idea behind an affiliate program is that the organizers
provide their “affiliates” with almost all the tools they need
to commit a crime. The task of the “affiliates” is to
generate as many successful malware infections as
possible. In return, the owner or owners of the affiliate
program share the income received as a result of these
infections with the affiliates. Depending on the type of
fraudulent scheme this could be a share of:

The sums stolen from the accounts of Internet banking
users;
The money paid by the user as a ransom when
cybercriminals use ransomware Trojans;
The money stolen from the “prepaid” accounts of
mobile device users by sending out SMS messages to
premium mobile numbers with the help of a malicious
program.
Creating and supporting an affiliate program for the
purpose of stealing money is a cybercrime committed, as
a rule, by a group of users. However, such projects are
often carried out by large organized groups whose activity
is analyzed later in this document.

This advertisement announces the launch of the beta testing of an
affiliate program used to distribute encrypting ransomware. Judging
by its characteristics, the group’s activity is focused on companies
located in the US and the UK. This is indicated by the comment
saying that the malware distributed via the partner network is able to
encrypt files with 80 different extensions, many of which are files of
applications used in companies. The text on requirements for
candidates to participate in testing includes a demonstration of the
presence of traffic or downloads from the United States and the
United Kingdom.

According to Kaspersky Lab experts, affiliate programs
are becoming less popular with Russian­language
cybercriminals. The main driver of their popularity had
been fraudulent schemes used to infect users’ mobile
devices with malicious programs which then sent out SMS
messages to premium numbers. However, in the spring of
2014, the Russian regulator introduced new requirements
https://securelist.com/analysis/publications/72782/russian-financial-cybercrime-how-it-works/

12/28

2015/11/24

for the organization of such services, which included a
need to secure additional confirmation of subscription to a
particular paid mobile service. This change was
instrumental in reducing the number of malicious mobile
partner programs to practically zero. Nevertheless, this
type of joint cybercriminal activity is still used by groups
specializing in the distribution of encrypting ransomware.

Small Groups
What distinguishes this form of cybercriminal activity from
an affiliate program is that in this instance the criminal or
criminals organize their own fraudulent scheme. Most of
the components needed for the attack, such as malware
and its modifications (“re­packed” malware), the traffic, the
servers, etc., are bought on the black market. Often,
members of such groups are not experts in the field of
computer and network technologies; they learn about the
components and organization of financial attacks from
public sources, usually forums. The abilities of such
groups can be restricted by a number of factors.
Specifically, the use of widely­available malware results in
rapid detection by security solutions. This, in turn, makes
cybercriminals invest more money in the distribution of
malware and in its “re­packing” to bypass detection. The
end result is a significant drop in profits for the attacker.

Mistakes made by this type of cybercriminal often result in
their identification and arrest. However, as a relatively low
cost entry into the world of cybercriminal activity (from $
200), this “amateur” format continues to attract new
dealers.

An example of such an “amateur” criminal organization is
the group that in 2012 was convicted by the Russian court
for stealing more than 13 million rubles (then worth about
$422,000) from a Russian bank’s online customers.
During a comprehensive investigation Kaspersky Lab
experts were able to collect the information that allowed
law enforcement authorities to identify those behind the
theft.
The court sentenced two members of the criminal group,

2015/11/24

giving each a suspended sentence of four and a half
years. However, this verdict did not stop the criminals, and
they continued to commit crimes, stealing almost as much
again over the next two and a half years. They were re­
arrested in May 2015.

Large organized criminal groups
Large criminal groups differ from the other players, both
through a larger scale of activity and through a more
thorough approach to the organization and operation of
criminal schemes. Such groups can comprise up to
several dozen people (not including money mules used for
cashing and “laundering” money.) The targets of their
attacks are not limited to individual online banking
customers: they also attack small and medium­sized
companies, while the largest and most sophisticated of
them, such as Carbanak focus mostly on banks and e­
payment systems.

The operational structure of large groups differs
significantly from smaller groups. To a certain extent, the
structure reflects that of an ordinary, average­sized
company engaged in software development.

In particular, large groups have some form of regular staff
– a group of associates who perform organizational tasks
in return for a regular, fixed payment. However, even in
these large, professional groups some of the tasks are
passed to third­party contractors. For example, the “re­
packing” of malware can be performed by the staff or hired
virus writers or via third­party services where the process
is automated with the help of special software. The same
is true for many other elements of the IT infrastructure
required for committing crime.
Examples of large, organized criminal groups are Carberp,
whose members were arrested in Russia and Ukraine in
2012 and 2013 respectively, and Carbanak, unmasked by
Kaspersky Lab in early 2015.

Although the damage from the activity of partner programs
and small groups can run into hundreds of thousands of
https://securelist.com/analysis/publications/72782/russian-financial-cybercrime-how-it-works/

dollars, the large criminal groups are the most dangerous
and destructive. The estimated damage caused by
Carberp reaches several hundred million dollars (up to a
billion). In this regard, studying how these groups function
and the tactics they use is extremely important, as it
strengthens our ability to effectively investigate their
activity and – ultimately – to suppress it.

Distribution of roles in a large
cybercriminal group
A major financial cybercrime undertaken by criminal
“experts” in security and the finance sector can result in
multi­million dollar losses for attacked organizations. As a
rule, such crimes are preceded by many months of
preparation. This preparation includes constructing
complex infrastructure, and selecting and developing
malicious software, as well as a thorough study of the
target organization in order to clarify the details of its
internal operations and security vulnerabilities. Each
member of the criminal group has their own
responsibilities.

The following role distribution is typical for a criminal group
involved in stealing money. The distribution of roles in
groups that specialize in other types of cybercrime may be
different.

Virus writer/Programmer
A virus writer or programmer is responsible for creating
malicious programs, i.e. the programs that allow the
attackers to gain a foothold in the corporate network of the
target organization, download additional malware that will
help to obtain the necessary information, and ultimately
steal money.

The significance of this group member and the nature of
their relationship with the organizers may vary from group
to group. For example, if the group uses ready­made
malware taken from open sources or bought from other
virus writers, their functions may be limited to setting and
modifying malicious programs to work in the infrastructure
created specifically for a certain cybercrime, or to adapt it
for attacks on specific institutions. The most advanced
groups, however, tend to rely on their own “developments”
since it makes a malicious program less visible to most
security solutions and provides more opportunities for
malware modification. Where this is the case, the virus
writer’s role becomes more important as they are
responsible for the architecture and feature set of a
malicious program.

A virus writer can also take on responsibility for malware
“re­packing”. But this happens only when the organizer
wants to keep the maximum number of tasks within the
group, and where original software is used for malware
“re­packing”. In most cases, however, this procedure is
shifted to third­party contractors or packing­services.

Testers
The function of testers in a criminal group is not that
different from testers working in legal IT companies. In
both cases, testers receive from their managers the
https://securelist.com/analysis/publications/72782/russian-financial-cybercrime-how-it-works/

16/28

2015/11/24

specifications for testing programs in different
environments (different versions of operating systems,
different sets of installed applications, etc.) and execute
them. If a fraudulent scheme involves fake interfaces of
remote banking or e­payment systems, the task of testers
also includes monitoring the correct operation of these
fakes.

Web designers and Web
programmers
Typically, web designers and web programmers are
remote employees, whose tasks include creating phishing
pages and websites, fake application interfaces and web
injects, all of which are used to steal data to get access to
e­payment and e­banking system.

Distributors
Distributors aim to ensure the download of malicious
software on as many devices as possible. The result is
achieved by using several tools. Generally, the group
organizer determines the profile of the users to be infected
and buys the required type of traffic from the so­called
traffic providers (services to attract users with certain
characteristics to a particular website).

An advert offering to buy traffic. Cybercriminals are willing to pay
only for the successful installation of malicious software at $ 140 per
1000 “call­backs” (a message that is sent by the malware to the
command server after a successful infection).

17/28

2015/11/24

Russian financial cybercrime: how it works - Securelist

The organizer can choose and order a spam mailing that
will contain either an infected attached file or a link taking
a victim to a malicious website. The organizers can also
choose the site with the necessary target audience;
involve hackers in breaking into it and placing the exploit
pack on it. Of course, all these tools can be used in
combination with each other.

Hackers
Often, in the course of an attack, the exploits and other
malicious software the organizer has to hand is not
enough to infect all the computers necessary for the attack
and to anchor in them. It may become necessary to hack
into a specific computer or site. In such cases, the
organizers involve hackers, people who have considerable
skills in information security and are able to perform non­
standard tasks. In many of the cases examined by
Kaspersky Lab experts, hackers were occasionally
involved and were paid on a fee­for­service basis.
However, if hacking is required regularly (e.g., for targeted
attacks on financial institutions), a hacker becomes a
“team member” and is often one of the cybercriminal
group’s key participants, along with the organizers and
money flow managers.

System administrators
System administrators in cybercriminal groups perform
near­identical tasks to their counterparts in legitimate
businesses: they implement the IT infrastructure and
maintain it in working condition. Cybercriminal system
administrators configure management servers, buy abuse­
resistant hostings for servers, ensure the availability of
tools for anonymous connection to the servers (VPN) and
resolve other technical challenges, including the
interaction with remote system administrators hired to
perform small tasks.

Call services
Social engineering is important for the success of the
https://securelist.com/analysis/publications/72782/russian-financial-cybercrime-how-it-works/

18/28

2015/11/24

cybercriminal business. Especially when it comes to
attacks on organizations that result in the theft of huge
sums of money. In most cases, even if the attackers are
able to establish control over the computer from which the
transaction could be performed, confirmation of its
legitimacy is required to successfully complete the
operation. This is what the “call service” is for. At the
specified time, its “employees” play the role of an
employee of the attacked organization or a bank with
which the organization works, and confirm the legitimacy
of the transaction.

“Call services” can participate in a particular cybercrime
both as a subdivision of the criminal group, or as a third­
party organization, performing a specific task on a fee­for­
service basis. The forums that users involved in
cybercrime use to communicate with each carry plenty of
ads offering such services.

This advertisement offers “call services” in English, German, Dutch
and French. The group specializes in calls to Internet stores and
banks, as well to duped mules. Also, the group offers the quick
creation of local toll­free numbers used to imitate support services in
fraudulent schemes, receiving SMS messages, and receiving and
sending faxes. The criminals ask from $10 to $12 for one call, $ 10
for receiving SMS and from $ 15 for creating toll­free numbers.

According to Kaspersky Lab, large cybercriminal groups
prefer to have their own “call services” so they hardly ever
turn to third­party providers.

Money ﬂow managers

Money flow managers are members of the cybercriminal
group who come into play when all the technical tasks for
organizing the attack (choosing and infecting the target
and anchoring in its infrastructure) are fulfilled, and
everything is ready to commit the theft. Money flow
managers are the people who withdraw money from
compromised accounts. However, their participation is not
limited to pressing the keys; they play a key role in the
whole process.

The list of key
roles in financial
cyber gangs
almost mirrors IT­
companies

Money flow managers usually thoroughly understand the
internal rules of the attacked organization (they even know
the lunch hours of the employee from whose computer the
fraudulent transaction will be made). They know how the
automated anti­fraud systems operate and how to bypass
them. In other words, in addition to their criminal role of
thieves, money flow managers perform “expert” tasks that
are difficult or impossible to automate. Perhaps because
of this special status, money flow managers are one of the
few members of the criminal group who receive a
percentage of the stolen money rather than a fixed
“salary”.

Money flow managers often perform as botnet operators.
i.e. members of the criminal group who analyze and
classify the information obtained from infected computers
(the access to the remote banking services, availability of
money on the accounts which could be accessed, the
organization where the infected computer is located, etc.).
Besides money loaders, these “working conditions” are
only shared by the leaders of mule projects.

stealing money. The function of the mules is to get the
stolen money, cash it and transfer to the criminal group its
due share. To do this, the head of mules builds their own
infrastructure, which consists of legal entities and
individuals with their own bank accounts, to which the
stolen money is transferred and from which it is later
withdrawn and moved into the pockets of the fraudsters.
The mule project leader cooperates with the organizer of
the criminal group, and provides them with the numbers of
the accounts to which the money loader sends the stolen
money. Both mule project leaders and money flow
managers work on commission which, according to the
information obtained by Kaspersky Lab during the course
of investigation, can amount to half the sum stolen.

Mule “projects”
Mule projects are a vital component of any financial
cybercrime. Such groups comprise one or more
organizers and up to several dozen individual mules.

A mule (or drop) is a holder of a means of payment who,
on command from the money mules manager, cashes the
money received into their/an account, or transfers it to
another account as specified by the money mules
manager.

Mules can be divided into two types: duped and non­
duped. Duped mules are people who, at least at the
beginning of their cooperation with the money mules
manager, do not realize they are involved in a criminal
scheme. As a rule, the task of getting and transferring
money is presented to them under some plausible pretext.
For example, the money mules manager can establish a
legal entity and appoint to an executive position (the
general or financial director, for example) a person who
will perform the functions of the duped mule: such as
signing corporate documents which will, in fact serve as a
legal screen for withdrawing stolen money.

Non­duped mules are well aware of the real purpose of
the money mules manager’s tasks.

The options used by the mule projects to withdraw money
are manifold. Depending on the amount of money stolen,
they may include individual credit card holders ready to
cash money and give it to the representative of the money
mules manager for a small fee, or specially created legal
entities, whose representatives open “salary projects”
(credit cards for transferring the salaries of company
employees) at their corporate bank.

Yet another common method for constructing a mule
scheme is for non­duped mules to open dozens of
accounts at different banks.

This advert offers sets of payment cards (the card, the documents
based on which the card was authorized, the SIM card with which
the bank account of the card is associated) that can be used for
cashing stolen money. For sale is the card issued by Russian banks
and banks from neighboring countries, as well as banks from the
countries of Europe, Asia and the United States. The Momentum­
type set is costs 3000 rubles (less than $50), the set with the
Platinum card – eight thousand rubles (about $120).

When the theft occurs outside of Russia, the role of the
non­duped mules is performed by a citizen or group of
citizens of an Eastern Europe country, who within a short
period of time visit several countries on the continent and
in each of them open accounts in their names. Then the
non­dupe mules provide the money mules manager with

the data to access all these accounts. These accounts are
used later to withdraw the stolen money.

An example of an ad offering for sale a list of companies registered
in the Russian Federation and in the offshore zone. The services of
cybercriminals cost from $560 to $750.

Stuﬀers
The word “stuffer” comes from the word “stuff” (a
colloquial word for “goods”). One way to withdraw stolen
money is by buying goods in e­stores with the stolen
money, reselling them and returning to the fraudsters their
due percent. This is done by the stuffers, members of the
cybercriminal groups engaged in spending money from
compromised accounts on purchasing goods in online
stores.
In fact, a stuffer is a variation of the money flow manager.
Withdrawing money by purchasing goods is generally
practiced if the stolen sums are relatively small. As a rule,
the stuffers work in a team with the fences. Working “in
tandem” often involves purchasing a certain type of goods,
sometimes from a specific manufacturer or a clearly­
defined model.

Organizer
If we consider cybercrime as a project, the organizer of
the criminal group is its general manager. Their duties
usually include financing the preparatory phase of the
attack, allocating tasks to executors, monitoring their
performance and interacting with third­party agents such
https://securelist.com/analysis/publications/72782/russian-financial-cybercrime-how-it-works/

23/28

Russian financial cybercrime: how it works - Securelist

as mule projects and call services (if the group does not
have its own). The organizer determines the targets for
attacks, selects the necessary “specialists” and negotiates
with them.

Stages of the attacks
It should be noted that the above classifications are not
set in stone. In some cases, a single member of the
criminal group can combine several roles. Nevertheless,
regardless of how many people execute them, each of the
roles described can be found when investigating almost
every money­related cybercriminal incident. Here’s how
they work in “real time.”

1. Exploration. When it comes to targeted attacks on a
specific company, the organizer first instructs the
contractors to collect information about the company,
which will help to develop a plausible social
engineering scheme for the first stage of attack. If we
are talking about an attack on individual users, the
preliminary exploration stage is skipped or limited to
choosing a “target audience” for the attack (for
example, the users of the online banking service of a
specific bank) and creating phishing emails and
phishing sites with relevant content.

2. Infection. Penetration of the corporate network is
performed by spear­phishing or a phishing mass­
mailing that contains an attachment with the special
document or a malicious web­link. Opening the
attachment or following the link leads to malware
infection. Often, infection occurs automatically without
the user’s awareness or participation – after clicking
on the link, a malicious program is automatically
downloaded on the user’s computer (drive­by
download) and runs on it.
In other cases, infection is carried out via
compromised popular sites on which a tool is placed
that invisibly redirects users to a third­party site
containing a set of exploits. Once on this site, the user

will be infected with malware.

Once inside the system cybercriminals use a number
of malicious tools to consolidate their presence. For
example, to ensure that internal sites of compromised
organizations have the malware reinstalled when the
organization’s security software deletes the previous
version. In addition, attackers are often set up within
the infrastructure software of the attacked
organization, enabling easy access to the internal
corporate network from outside.

3. Exploration and implementation. The programs for
remote, hidden administration and management are
downloaded onto compromised computers. They are
used by cybercriminals to gain system administrators’
credentials. Legal programs for remote management
and administration whose functionality is known to
many users are often used for this.
4. Money theft. In the final stage, cybercriminals access
the financial systems of the targeted organization and
transfer money from its accounts to the accounts of
the mule projects or withdraw money directly at ATMs.

Conclusion
Financial cybercrime backed by Russian­speaking
criminals has become widespread in recent years and this
growth is due to a number of causes. The main ones are:

Not enough qualified staff in law enforcement
agencies;
Inadequate legislation allowing criminals in many
cases to avoid responsibility or to receive a lighter
sentence;
A lack of established procedures for international
cooperation between law enforcement agencies and
expert organizations in different countries.
Unlike the real world, a robbery in cyberspace usually
goes unnoticed and there is a very small window for

collecting digital evidence after the crime. Further,
criminals have no need to stay in the country where the
crime is committed.

Unfortunately, for Russian­speaking cybercriminals
current conditions are more than favorable: the risk of
prosecution is low while the potential rewards are high. As
a result, the number of crimes and the damage caused by
them is growing, and the market for cybercriminal services
is increasing momentum.

The lack of established mechanisms for international
cooperation also plays into the hands of criminals: for
example, Kaspersky Lab experts know that the members
of some criminal groups permanently reside and work in
Russia’s neighbors, while the citizens of the neighboring
states involved in criminal activity often live and operate in
the territory of the Russian Federation.
Kaspersky Lab is doing everything possible to terminate
the activity of cybercriminal groups and encourages other
companies and law enforcement agencies in all countries
to cooperate.

The international investigation of Carbanak’s activity,
initiated by Kaspersky Lab, is the first example of
successful international cooperation. If the world is to see
a serious and positive change there should be more such
cases.

Lab Computer Incidents
Investigation?
Kaspersky Lab is a well­known developer of anti­malware
security solutions. But the company provides
comprehensive protection, and this also includes services
for computer incidents investigation.

Evidence of an incident, mainly presented in the form of
digital data, needs to be collected and recorded so that
there are no grounds for doubt in the investigation and trial
when a victim makes a court application.

Kaspersky Lab Computer Incidents Investigation is
responsible for:

Responding to IT security incidents and providing a
quick analysis of the situation;
Collecting digital evidence and determining the
circumstances of IT security incidents in accordance
with established procedures;
Analyzing the evidence collected, searching the
information related to the circumstances of the
incident on the Internet and fixing them;
Preparing materials for the victim’s application to law
enforcement agencies;
Providing expert support to investigative operations.
A huge amount of data is processed when responding to
IT security incidents and supporting investigative
operations. The analysis of this data, in combination with
statistics on malicious objects detected identifies the
trends of criminal behavior in cyberspace.
The Kaspersky Lab Computer Incidents Investigation
Department was established in 2011 and involves six
forensic experts.

Superb article which nicely sets out the structure and operation of
these criminal networks.
I have distributed a link to this article to several of my clients in the
UK.

Keep up the good work.
