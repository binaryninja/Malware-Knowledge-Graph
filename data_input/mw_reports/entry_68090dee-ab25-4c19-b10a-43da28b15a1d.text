data of the company’s employees and senior executives have been leaked to the public.

message, along with a skull graphic, appeared on their computer screens. The message,
sent by a hacker group who call themselves "Guardians of Peace" (#GOP), warned that it

was "only the beginning," and that they will continue until their "request be met". Shortly after
the news broke out about the Sony hack, there were rampant claims of the involvement of
North Korea who used a certain “wiper” malware.

The recent attack reminds IT administrators to learn from such incidents and think ahead in
terms of securing their network infrastructure. Organizations should look into the
developments of the Sony attack, and learn from it to be able to defend their own networks
accordingly.

Individuals should also be vigilant; as investigative reports of controversial attacks continue
to flood the news, bad guys could use this as a social engineering lure to trick users into
clicking on suspicious links in spam mails and social media posts. As such, we advise users
to be careful regarding the links they click and the stories they follow online, as
cybercriminals are quick to play on people’s curiosity especially when it comes to major news
breakouts.
