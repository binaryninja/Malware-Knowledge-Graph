This redacted report is based on our actual proactive victim technical breach intelligence and
subsequent incident response (not a simulated or sandbox environment) identified via unique
high-value Conti ransomware collections at AdvIntel via our product “Andariel.”

On January 27, 2022, AdvIntel utilized its adversarial visibility into Conti ransomware to
discover and then internally alert our customers and partners that a novel extortion group,
“Karakurt”, was actually a side-operation of the Conti sub-group.

This is not the first time AdvIntel had discovered Conti using side-groups or even third-party
groups in order to adjust their monetization model. Just a portion of the ransomware
collectives found to have been working under Conti in some respect include AvosLocker,
BlackCat/AlphV, BlackByte, HIVE, HelloKitty/FiveHands, and the former affiliates of Babuk.
Utilizing our exclusive primary-source intelligence of Conti’s internal structure, AdvIntel was
then able to identify multiple instances of Conti offering exclusive data access to
these accomplice groups.

The Conti syndicate had a range of rationales for offering this, which differed heavily
depending on the group it presented them to. In certain cases, this endowment was a way
for Conti to outsource the low-profile accesses that it was uninterested in spending time to

process themselves. For others, the business agreement was a form of subtle espionage—a
way to better understand its competitor’s inner workings while gaining their favor.

However, out of all of the external arrangements and alliances Conti has created, Karakurt
stands out, both as the structured and the pervasive connection to Conti itself.

The Old Guard—Trapped Between Tradition and Innovation

AdvIntel publicly confirmed the Karakurt-Conti liaison on April 13, 2022, after extensively
reviewing the scope of our ransomware prevention ‘initial attack collections’.

Since its early days as the now-defunct organization Ryuk, theConti syndicate has always
had a clear approach to the money-making aspect of its business model—a pure focus on
data encryption.

In late 2019 and early 2020, when large and small ransomware gangs alike were starting to
create shame blogs (in order to practice a new trend of data brokering that was quickly being
dubbed “double extortion”), Conti chose to remain loyal to its roots. Their tried-and-true

3/9

method of locking targets’ data and demanding money for decryption had been reliably
successful for them up until that point, and Conti saw no need to fix something that they
didn’t think was broken. At the time, the group did not even have their own website.

2021 was the year of change for Conti. Their competitors started to rapidly die out one-byone: REvil, Advaddon, Darkside, BlackMatter, Egregor, Babuk, and numerous others exited
the criminal ring, which not only eliminated Conti’s direct competition but made the group’s
edge in resilience and strategy immediately obvious to others. A sweeping change seemed
to take over the syndicate’s mindset overnight: change that would make Conti not only the
sole survivor of the war for data supremacy, but the more advanced group that the field had
known.

One of these main vectors of change involved rethinking the concept of data
monetization. In July 2021, Conti created an entire division to process, investigate, and
weaponize stolen files, in order to apply maximum pressure against their targets.

New and more sophisticated methods were developed for more targeted data exfiltration,
and new tools were weaponized to make that exfiltration seamless, more concealed. But
these steps were not sufficient for Conti to overcome their internal traditionalism, which was
held over from a time when groups had exclusively based their operations around data
denial—not data exfiltration. This internal strife between Conti’s goals and values are what
ultimately led them to seek a separate solution to monetize data exfiltration—enter Karakurt.

4/9

Conti had developed a well-set data exfiltration model but was not able to monetize it
properly due to their original locker-centric approach.

5/9

Karakurt - A Solution for Data Monetization

The key reason for Conti initially creating Karakurt was thatat the time, Conti was bound to
the locker build model. This meant that the group’s reputation, their branding, and the fabric
of their operations were related to encryption exclusively—not theft. The Conti backend was
even developed so that the chat hash was created only after the locker build was created. In
other words, without proper locker build with chat identified, there was no way for Conti to
even begin to negotiate with their prospective targets.

As a result, if data was successfully taken (using all of the above-described methods) but the
locker was not executed properly, the stolen files simply remained on FTP/Google
Drive/MEGA drives before they would eventually disappear. The group experienced recurring
scenarios in which a network infiltration was completed and data was stolen, but due to
issues solely related to the locker execution (no sufficient access privileges, detection, build
failure), the entire operation yielded zero revenue for them.

Conti wasn’t just attached to their locker: In a sense, they were their locker, at least to their
potential targets and business associates, and few had reason to ever think of them outside
the context of that locker’s operations.

To address these issues without rebuilding the entire syndicate, Conti introduced a
solution—a sub-group, Karakurt. In December 2021, Karakurt quickly amassed record
numbers, with over forty victims to its name.

Reports noted that, unlike other notable ransomware groups, Karakurt had an approach of
moving quickly through its hit list of targets, steering clear of major business interruptions in
favor of soliciting paltry ransoms from small businesses before quickly shifting focus to their
next victim. These quick movements suggested that Karakurt came already supplied with
network access and intelligence information, even prior to the compromises they were being
credited for.

BazarLoader -> BazarBackdoor -> Cobalt Strike -> Karakurt Extortion

6/9

Indeed, these initial accesses were coming from Conti, for whom Karakurt had become a tool
to make money in cases where data had been stolen from victims, but not locked. According
to an AdvIntel-exclusive source, Conti’s distinctive Cobalt Strike beacons were often the
initial vector in Karakurt’s attacks, but what’s even more compelling is that the so-called
“Patient Zero” of a number of breaches attributed to Karakurt was BazarBackdoor— a
backdoor malwarenearly exclusive to Conti operations and especially well-geared for biggame hunting, the exact opposite of what Karakurt was known for at the time.

Although it may sound counter-intuitive, the usage of BazarBackdoor likely explains
Karakurt’s aforementioned “pattern” of targeting small entities. As often happens in
ransomware victimology, the entities that are reported are those that have declined to pay
ransom, or that have restored their systems themselves after the attack. Since Karakurt likely
actually specializes in larger entities, which they extort via data theft, most of the
negotiation failures that are disclosed and reported are likely those ofthe smaller
companies that are simply not a priority for them.

Conclusion

Karakurt was not a way to diversify Conti’s capabilities, they were a way to resolve the
systemic contradictions that were built in the foundation of the group, by
simultaneously giving them a path to leak monetization while outwardly keeping up the
group’s traditional values. By delegating Karakurt with cases in which data locking was
unsuccessful, Conti opened up a stream of revenue for themselves, all while keeping up the
appearance of business as usual. Once it was clear that Karakurt was a successful venture,
this became a precedent that was then repeated with other approaches.

Conti began to create and attach sub-groups that do not interfere with their major workflow,
but rather complement and expand it. These subsidiary groups, similar to Karakurt, are able
to take a new approach (Log4Shell exploitation, new botnet infection paths, new social
engendering operations such as BazarCall) and continue to develop it on their own right,
able to accomplish greater financial success for the group members than a typical locker
model.

Recommendations & Mitigations

7/9

Karakurt is a data-stealing venture, therefore, most mitigations should be directed at
the detection of abnormal network presence. Special emphasis should be placed on
network investigation tools typical for Karakurt: Cobalt Strike sessions opened,
Metasploit, and customized PowerShell commands since all these tools are
ubiquitous for Conti attacks, whereas these attacks are initiated via BazarCall or not.
Rclone is Karakurt’s main data exfiltration command-line interface. Rclone activity can
be captured through proper logging of process execution with command-line
arguments. Rclone commands can be tracked via the Andariel Cobalt Strike index.

commands can be found in AdvIntel’s [Andariel Cookbook] Tracking Adversarial Data
Exfiltration Attempts Using Andariel’s “Cobalt Strike Ransomware Breach Logs”
Action and monitoring for network segmentation, network hierarchy, and abnormal
in-network behavior. Karakurt focuses on extensive lateral movement to be able to
find the most important shares containing data.
Karakurt will most likely utilize legitimate tools, including RMM software, or more
importantly, remote desktop software (RDS) such as AnyDesk and Zoho.

The threat group Karakurt, taking its name from a type of “black wolf” spider from Europe,
Asia, and northern Africa, emerged in 2021—and quickly garnered attention for amassing
records of over forty victims. Early reports noted that unlike other notable ransomware
groups, Karakurt had an approach of moving quickly through targets, avoiding major
business interruptions in favor of soliciting small ransoms from small businesses. AdvIntel
discovered a connection between Karakurt and ransomware group Conti in early 2022,
noting its use of Cobalt Strike and BazarBackdoor as the group’s initial attack vectors. The
current consensus on Karakurt’s operational structure is that the group is actually a
subsidiary within the larger Conti conglomerate, and that it is conducting data exfiltration (not
data encryption) attacks targeting larger entities, which go generally unreported to the public.
