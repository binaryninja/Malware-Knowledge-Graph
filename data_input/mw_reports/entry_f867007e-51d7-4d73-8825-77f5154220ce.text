１．A41APT Campaign Overview

A41APT Campaign Overview
� Period of Activity: March 2019 to January 2021
� Target: Japan (Japanese companies including overseas branches)
� Infection Vector: SSL-VPN abuse (Could not observed spear-phishing)
� Implants: DESLoader, SodaMaster, P8RAT and FYAntiLoader etc.

� Characteristics: Very tough to detect attacker’s intrusion

We call this threat campaign A41APT from the hostname feature
“DESKTOP-A41UVJV” that is continuously used during the initial intrusion.

３．Characteristics of Intrusion

Intrusion method in A41APT campaign
Initial Intrusion

Penetration via SSL-VPN
using vulnerabilities or stolen
credentials

Internal Recon.
Lateral Movement

Persistence of
malware

C2
Communication

Perform a port scan to search
for open RDP or SMB port.
Then, connect to RDP with an
administrator account.

Persistence by scheduled task
registration to execute the
legitimate PE

Communicate with C2 server
via DESLoader’s payload or
PowerShell remoting

Scheduled task registration

Server*

・・・

・・・

Server

AD Server

Laptop

Credential
Dumping

*We have also observed cases where traces have been removed from other compromised servers as well.

Trace Removal

Delete the event log after
communication with C2 is
finished.

25

Characteristics of Compromise
1. Initial intrusion using SSL-VPN products
2. Network scanning and credential theft
3. PowerShell remoting to remove event logs
4. Persistence of malware by scheduled task

26

３-１． Initial intrusion via SSL-VPN (e.g. session hijacking)
•

In October 2019, an attacker used the hostname DESKTOP-A41UVJV to hijack sessions to
enter the internal network via SSL-VPN product, Pulse Secure.

•

JPCERT also reported a similar attack targeting SSL-VPN [4].

•

In some cases, attackers used credentials that they had stolen in the past intrusion.

27

３-2． Network scanning and credential theft
Network scanning and RDP

▪ After the intrusion by SSL-VPN, perform
internal network scanning to find open port
RDP (3389/TCP) and SMB (445/TCP).

▪

Use an administrator account to deploy RDP
to servers with free RDP.

Credential theft

▪ Run csvde.exe, a CSV export command line
tool provided by Microsoft.
▪ Execute AdFind provided by joeware.
▪ Dump of SYSTEM/SECURITY/SAM hive, etc.

e.g. server types that are frequently
compromised by RDP
AD server
File server
Anti Virus management server
Backup server
Print server
FAX server

https://www.joeware.net/freetools/tools/adfind/
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/itpro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/cc732101(v=ws.11)

28

３-3． PowerShell remoting to delete event logs
•

Event log: the end of a PowerShell
remoting session

•

Windows PowerShell.evtx
EID: 403

•

The "C2 address" and the "*.nls file
name" are changed, but the rest is the
same
⇒ probably common tools execution

29

３-４．Persistence of malware by scheduled task
▪ Registered a task scheduler that executes a legitimate executable file that loads DESLoader
every 15 minutes.

▪ It is unlikely that the same scheduled task name is created on the compromised hosts.

30

e.g. Improperly registered scheduled tasks observed in the past

４．Threat Actor’s Infrastructure

Threat Actor’s Infrastructure
1. The hostname used for the intrusion via SSL-VPN
2. Characteristics of the C2 infrastructure

33

Hostname used for the initial intrusion via SSL-VPN
▪ Tendency to use distinctive hostnames and attempt intrusions
while changing IP addresses

✔Host names used in breaches observed in the past
Hostname

DESKTOP-V24F9JL

2020/12

▪ Tendency to use an IP for intrusion that is different from the C2 server’s IP
34

Characteristics of the C2 infrastructure
▪ For C2, there is a tendency to use IP addresses and not to use domains.

▪ From the observed C2 IP addresses, there is little bias toward country and AS, and we
observed that there is a tendency not to reuse IP addresses repeatedly.

35

５．Consideration of Threat Actor’s Attribution

Considerations for attribution of A41APT
1. Relevance to APT10
2. Relevance to BlackTech

37

１．Relevance to APT10
▪
▪

▪

Common TTPs

Two ways linked to APT10:
Confirmed the existence of an early version of
SodaMaster (x86) in March 2019, which was involved
in an attack against Turkey and attributed to APT10
(mentioned [5])
xRAT observed in A41APT campaign has common
TTPs with BlackBerry Cylance reports in 2019 was
confirmed [6].

ShellCode

- CPPHostDLR loader

*Compared to SodaMaster in 2020, only two commands are supported.

38

２．Relevance to BlackTech
SodaMaster

TSCookie

▪ Identified common features between
SodaMaster and
TSCookie [7].
▪ The same information is collected
from the compromised host in the
initial stage
– Username
– Computer name
– Current process ID

▪ Observed existence of two malware,
SodaMaster and TSCookie, on
multiple compromised hosts
39

６．Summary

Wrap up：A41APT Campaign
▪ Intrusion via SSL-VPN

ADVERSARY

▪ Heavy usage of RDP for lateral
movement (mainly servers)

▪ Strong association with APT10

▪ Abusing DLL-Sideloading

▪ Potential relevance to BlackTech

▪ Remove traces

INFRASTRUCTURE

CAPABILITIES
▪ Targeting Japanese companies
including overseas branches

▪ Heavy usage of IP addresses for C2
(no domain usage)

▪ Wide range of industries such as
manufacturing

▪ Less reuse of IP addresses for C2

VICTIMS

▪ IP for an initial intrusion and C2 IP are
41
different.

Wrap up： Features of this campaign
✔ Targeting the kryptonite of EDR/FSA detection
• Malware is written on the disk by the attacker's manual operation via SSL-VPN instead of malware-

originated intrusion from Spear phishing email (legitimate file, loader, encrypted file)
• Intrusion from group affiliates, including overseas companies
• Malware is mostly placed on servers, and the number of compromised servers are very small.
• Most of the malware detected in the same period have different C2 addresses, so there is little tendency
to use the same samples.

✔ After the intrusion, some rough operations were seen.
• Heavy usage of network discovery using RDP
• Common traces deletion method of event logs

• Recorded attacker's hostname in event log

At the end...
 A41APT campaign is very stealthy and difficult to detect, but it is not undetectable.

 The compromised target has shifted from endpoint to server, and the intrusion route has also
shifted from spear phishing to abusing SSL-VPN. Security measures need to be reviewed in

your organization to respond to change in attack method.

 By refining daily security operations and thoroughly reviewing the security holes in each

organization's environment, it may be possible to detect and protect attacks from even small
anomalies.
