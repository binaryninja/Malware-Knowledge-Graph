The Rationale

Evidence is becoming primarily digital.

Technical obstacles make it increasingly difficult for governments
and law enforcement agencies to de-anonymise and access data
from suspects.
Encrypted channels allow criminals to exchange information
and hide from law enforcement surveillance.

Rapid Forensic Analysis

Offline to Online

Predictive Policing

100 hours of accessible CCTV
footage can be analysed for faces of
criminals in just 10 hours by our
algorithms

images of terrorists or of any person
of interest can be checked against
social networks, blogs and other
digital sources and databases

learning from criminal activities in the
past, our algorithms derive risky areas
and predict strategies of outlaws to
make police work more effective
