A new version of the Ryuk Stealer malware has been enhanced to allow it to steal a greater
amount of confidential files related to the military, government, financial statements,
banking, and other sensitive data.
In September 2019, we reported on a new malware that included references to the
Ryuk Ransomware and was used to steal files if the file's name matched certain keywords.
It is not known if this tool is created by the Ryuk Ransomware actors to be used for data
exfiltration before encrypting a victim's computer or if another actor simply borrowed from
the ransomware's code.
"It is likely the same actor with the access to the earlier Ryuk version who repurposed the
code portion for this stealer," Head of SentinelLabs Vitali Kremez told BleepingComputer.
What we do know is that the malware is targeting very specific keywords that could be
disastrous for governments, military operations, and law enforcement cases if the stolen
files are exposed.

New features added to the Ryuk Stealer
1/4

A new variant of the Ryuk Stealer malware was discovered today by MalwareHunterTeam
that adds a new file content scanning feature and additional keywords that it targets for
theft.
In the previous version, the Ryuk Stealer would scan a computer's files for Word (docx) and
Excel (xlsx) documents.
According to Kremez, this new version of the stealer will look for an additional seven file
types related to C++ source code, further Word and Excel document types, PDFs, JPG
image files, and cryptocurrency wallets.

Targeted Extension
The full list of targeted extensions are:
.cpp
.h
.xls
.xlsx
.doc
.docx
.pdf
wallet.dat
.jpg

If a file matches one of the above extensions, the stealer will check the contents of the file
and see if they contain one of the 85 keywords listed below.
'personal', 'securityN-CSR10-SBEDGAR', 'spy', 'radar', 'agent', 'newswire',
'marketwired', '10-Q', 'fraud', 'hack', 'defence', 'treason', 'censored', 'bribery',
'contraband', 'operation', 'attack', 'military', 'tank', 'convict', 'scheme',
'tactical', 'Engeneering', 'explosive', 'drug', 'traitor', 'suspect', 'cyber',
'document', 'embeddedspy', 'radio', 'submarine', 'restricted', 'secret', 'balance',
'statement', 'checking', 'saving', 'routing', 'finance', 'agreement', 'SWIFT',
'IBAN', 'license', 'Compilation', 'report', 'secret', 'confident', 'hidden',
'clandestine', 'illegal', 'compromate', 'privacy', 'private', 'contract',
'concealed', 'backdoorundercover', 'clandestine', 'investigation', 'federal',
'bureau', 'government', 'security', 'unclassified', seed', 'personal', 'confident',
'mail', 'letter', 'passport', 'victim', 'court', 'NATO', 'Nato', 'scans', 'Emma',
'Liam', 'Olivia', 'Noah', 'William', 'Isabella', 'James', 'Sophia', 'Logan',

In addition, the stealer will check if the filename contains any of the following 55 keywords:
'SECURITY', 'N-CSR', '10-SB', 'EDGAR', ' spy ', 'radar', 'censored', 'agent',
'newswire', 'marketwired', '10-Q', 'fraud', 'hack', 'NATO', 'Nato',
'convictMilitary', 'military', 'submarine', 'Submarinesecret', 'Secret', 'scheme',
'tactical', 'Engeneering', 'explosive', 'drug', 'traitor', 'embeddedspy', 'radio',
'suspect', 'cyber', 'document', 'treasonrestricted', 'private', 'confident',
'important', 'pass', 'victim', 'court', 'hidden', 'bribery', 'contraband',
'operation', 'undercover', 'clandestine', 'investigation', 'federal', 'bureau',
'government', 'security', 'unclassified', 'concealed', 'newswire', 'marketwired',
'Clearance'

When a matching document is found, the malware will upload it to an FTP site that is under
the attacker's control. The two embedded FTP sites currently being used by the malware
are down.

Targeting highly sensitive documents
As you can see, the targeted keywords are related to sensitive subjects for a variety of data
categories such as:
Banking: 'SWIFT', 'IBAN', 'balance', 'statement', 'checking', 'saving', 'routing'
Finance: 'N-CSR', '10-SB', 'EDGAR', 'newswire', 'marketwired', '10-Q'
Law Enforcement: 'clandestine', 'investigation', 'federal', 'bureau', 'government',
'security', 'victim', 'court'
Military: 'NATO', 'operation', 'attack', 'spy', 'radar', 'tactical', 'tank', 'submarine'
Personal: 'personal', 'passport', 'Emma', 'Liam, 'Olivia, 'Noah', 'William', 'Isabella',
'James', 'Sophia', 'Logan'
The names in the Personal category are taken from the United States Social Security
Department's list of top baby names.
Some of the new search words that were added since the latest version include 'treason',
'NATO', 'convict', 'traitor', 'embeddedspy', 'cyber', 'submarine', 'Submarinesecret',
'contraband', 'radio', 'suspect', 'operation', and 'bribery.'
Based on the targeted keywords in this malware, it looks like the attackers are looking for
confidential information to sell to foreign adversaries, corporations, or to be used as
blackmail.
At this time, we do not know how this malware is being distributed and if its bundled with
ransomware attacks or used independently.
With data exfiltration becoming more common and increasingly being used by ransomware,
it is important to make sure you have good security measures in place to protect your
network from compromise.

3/4

This includes being careful of phishing emails with malicious attachments, do not make
Remote Desktop Services publicly accessible, make sure all software and operating
systems are updated, and make sure to use security software and good password policies.
