New Sandworm malware Cyclops Blink
replaces VPNFilter
The Sandworm actor, which the UK and US have previously attributed to
the Russian GRU, has replaced the exposed VPNFilter malware with a new
more advanced framework.

Background
The UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency (CISA), the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Federal Bureau
of Investigation (FBI) in the US have identified that the actor known as Sandworm or
Voodoo Bear is using a new malware, referred to here as Cyclops Blink. The NCSC,
CISA, NSA and FBI have previously attributed the Sandworm actor to the Russian
GRU’s Main Centre for Special Technologies GTsST. The malicious cyber activity
below has previously been attributed to Sandworm:
•
•
•
•
•

The BlackEnergy disruption of Ukrainian electricity in 2015
Industroyer in 2016
NotPetya in 2017
Attacks against the Winter Olympics and Paralympics in 20181
A series of disruptive attacks against Georgia in 20192

Cyclops Blink appears to be a replacement framework for the VPNFilter malware
exposed in 2018, which exploited network devices, primarily small office/home office
(SOHO) routers and network attached storage (NAS) devices.

This advisory summarises the VPNFilter malware it replaces, and provides more detail
about Cyclops Blink, as well as the associated tactics, techniques and procedures
(TTPs) used by Sandworm. An NCSC malware analysis report on Cyclops Blink is
also available and can be read in parallel.
It also points to mitigation measures to help organisations that may be affected by this
malware.

VPNFilter
First exposed in 2018
A series of articles published by Cisco Talos in 20181 describes VPNFilter and its
modules in detail. VPNFilter was deployed in stages, with most functionality in the
third-stage modules. These modules enabled traffic manipulation, destruction of the
infected host device, and likely enabled downstream devices to be exploited. They
also allowed monitoring of Modbus SCADA protocol which appears to be an ongoing
requirement for Sandworm, as also seen in their previous attacks against ICS
networks.
VPNFilter targeting was widespread and appeared indiscriminate, with some
exceptions: Cisco Talos reported an increase of victims in Ukraine in May 2018.
Sandworm also deployed VPNFilter against targets in the Republic of Korea before
the 2018 Winter Olympics.
In May 2018 Cisco Talos published the blog that exposed VPNFilter, and the US
Department of Justice linked the activity2 to Sandworm, and announced its disruption
of the botnet.

Activity since its exposure
A Trendmicro3 blog in January 2021 detailed residual VPNFilter infections and
provided data showing a reduction in requests to a known C2 domain. Since the
disruption in May 2018, Sandworm has shown limited interest in existing VPNFilter
footholds, instead preferring to retool.

Cyclops Blink
Active since 2019
The NCSC, CISA, FBI and NSA, along with industry partners, have now identified a
large-scale modular malware framework which is affecting network devices. The new
malware is referred to here as Cyclops Blink and has been deployed since at least
June 2019, fourteen months after VPNFilter was disrupted. In common with VPNFilter,
Cyclops Blink deployment also appears indiscriminate and widespread.
The actor has so far primarily deployed Cyclops Blink to WatchGuard devices,1 but it
is likely that Sandworm would be capable of compiling the malware for other
architectures and firmware.

Malware overview
The malware itself is sophisticated and modular with basic core functionality to beacon
(T1132.002) device information back to a server and enable files to be downloaded
and executed. There is also functionality to add new modules while the malware is
running, which allows Sandworm to implement additional capability as required.
The NCSC has published a malware analysis report on Cyclops Blink which provides
more detail about the malware.

Post exploitation
Post exploitation, Cyclops Blink is generally deployed as part of a firmware ‘update’
(T1542.001). This achieves persistence when the device is rebooted and makes
remediation harder.

1 Note that only WatchGuard devices that were reconfigured from the manufacture default settings to open remote

management interfaces to external access could be infected.

Victim devices are organised into clusters and each deployment of Cyclops Blink has
a list of command and control (C2) IP addresses and ports that it uses (T1008). All the
known C2 IP addresses to date have been used by compromised WatchGuard firewall
devices. Communications between Cyclops Blink clients and servers are protected
under Transport Layer Security (TLS) (T1071.001), using individually generated keys
and certificates. Sandworm manages Cyclops Blink by connecting to the C2 layer
through the Tor network:

Mitigation
Cyclops Blink persists on reboot and throughout the legitimate firmware update
process. Affected organisations should therefore take steps to remove the malware.
WatchGuard has worked closely with the FBI, CISA and the NCSC, and has provided
tooling and guidance to enable detection and removal of Cyclops Blink on WatchGuard
devices through a non-standard upgrade process. Device owners should follow each

step in these instructions to ensure that devices are patched to the latest version and
that any infection is removed.
WatchGuard tooling and guidance is available at:
https://detection.watchguard.com/
In addition:
•

•

If your device is identified as infected with Cyclops Blink, you should assume
that any passwords present on the device have been compromised and
replace them (see NCSC password guidance for organisations:
https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/passwords )
You should ensure that the management interface of network devices is not
exposed to the internet.

Indicators of compromise
Please refer to the accompanying Cyclops Blink malware analysis report for indicators
of compromise which may help detect this activity.

Conclusion
A Cyclops Blink infection does not mean that an organisation is the primary target,
but it may be selected to be, or its machines could be used to conduct attacks.
Organisations are advised to follow the mitigation advice in this advisory and to refer
to indicators of compromise (not exhaustive) in the Cyclops Blink malware analysis
report to detect possible activity on networks.
UK organisations affected by the activity outlined in this advisory should report any
compromises to the NCSC via our website.

Further guidance
A variety of mitigations will be of use in defending against the malware featured in this
advisory.
• Do not expose management interfaces of network devices to the internet: the
management interface is a significant attack surface, so not exposing them
reduces the risk. See NCSC guidance:
https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/acquiring-managing-and-disposing-networkdevices
• Protect your devices and networks by keeping them up to date: use the latest
supported versions, apply security patches promptly, use anti-virus and scan
regularly to guard against known malware threats. See NCSC
guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/mitigating-malware
• Use multi-factor authentication to reduce the impact of password
compromises. See NCSC guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/multifactor-authentication-online-services and https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/settingtwo-factor-authentication-2fa
• Treat people as your first line of defence. Tell staff how to report suspected
phishing emails, and ensure they feel confident to do so. Investigate their reports
promptly and thoroughly. Never punish users for clicking phishing links or opening
attachments. See NCSC guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/phishing
• Set up a security monitoring capability so you are collecting the data that will be
needed to analyse network intrusions. See NCSC
guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/introduction-logging-securitypurposes.
• Prevent and detect lateral movement in your organisation’s networks. See
NCSC guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/preventing-lateral-movement
