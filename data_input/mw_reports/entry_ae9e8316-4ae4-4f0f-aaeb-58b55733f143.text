A ransomware gang has made $260,000 in just five days simply by remotely encrypting
files on QNAP devices using the 7zip archive program.
Starting on Monday, QNAP NAS users from all over the world suddenly found their files
encrypted after a ransomware operation called Qlocker exploited vulnerabilities on their
devices.
While most ransomware groups put considerable development time in their malware to
make it efficient, feature-rich, and have strong encryption, the Qlocker gang didn't even
have to create their own malware program.
Instead, they scanned for QNAP devices connected to the Internet and exploited them
using the recently disclosed vulnerabilities. These exploits allowed the threat actors to
remotely execute the 7zip archival utility to password protect all the files on victims' NAS

storage devices.
Using such a simple approach allowed them to encrypt over a thousand, if not thousands,
of devices in just five days using a time-tested encryption algorithm built into the 7zip
archive utility.

Ransom demands were priced correctly
Enterprise-targeting ransomware usually demands ransom payments ranging from
$100,000 to $50 million to decrypt all of a victim's devices and not leak their stolen data.
However, Qlocker chose a different target - consumers and small-to-medium business
owners utilizing QNAP NAS devices for network storage.
It seems that the threat actors knew their targets well as they priced their ransom demands
at only 0.01 Bitcoins, or at today's Bitcoin prices, approximately $500.

Deciding to pay millions of dollars requires a company to think hard about whether the lost
data is worth millions of dollars.
However, paying $500 can be seen as a small price to pay to recover important files, no
matter how violated a victim may feel.
Qlocker's decision appears to have paid off as the payments have started to rush in earning
the threat actors a sizeable return for a few days of activity.

Qlocker made almost $260,000 so far
As the Qlocker ransomware uses a fixed set of Bitcoin addresses that victims are rotated
through, it has been possible for BleepingComputer to collect the addresses and monitor
their payments.
Tuesday night, security researcher Jack Cable discovered a short-lived bug that allowed
him to recover the passwords for 55 victims passwords for free. While utilizing this bug, he
collected ten different Bitcoin addresses that the threat actors were rotating with victims and
shared them with BleepingComputer.
Since then, BleepingComputer has collected an additional 10 addresses, for a total of
20 bitcoin addresses used by the Qlocker threat actors.
At this time, the 20 bitcoin addresses, shown below, have received ransom payments
totaling 5.25735623 Bitcoins. This amount is equivalent to approximately $258,494.

If we divide the amount of Bitcoins earned, we come out to approximately 525 victims
having paid the ransom so far.
Unfortunately, the ransoms keep coming in as users make the hard decision of paying to
recover their files, so this number will likely increase through the weekend and into next
week.
This ransomware campaign is still ongoing, with new victims appearing every day.
Therefore, all QNAP users must update the latest versions of the Multimedia Console,
Media Streaming Add-on, and Hybrid Backup Sync apps to fix the vulnerabilities and
protect against these ransomware attacks.
Users are also advised to secure their NAS devices so that other future attacks are harder
to accomplish.
For more information, you can read our dedicated Qlocker article or visit our highly
active Qlocker support topic, where users are helping each other recover files and secure
their devices.

more than 7 bitcoin in payments now...

danynap - 1 year ago

I am wishing to pay. This is the 2nd try, initially I've filled in the form with a wrong txid
(just to try). They f*#ing system has stored this and now it does not accept other data
in the fiels. The page shows "waiting for confirmations" eternally... Data lost forever!
no chance neither to pay :-(

Solved. The website resumed working. Paid. Got the password. Works. Now, hard
work to recover 4tb of files. I hope those criminals need all the money stolen this way
to purchase medicines !

They are clearing the accounts in favor of this address:
3QP1rnycGirbRqDs6t6jCs8QBDED9zF4VZ
then turn to the following address:
1EFdmL5ZYYUQ32a63ENZtiU7F7VuDAJJKr
today only they moved the first 3BTC and the TOR site are 3 days with the wording at
the top:
"This site will be closed soon."

Update (May 5th): the "website" is down. Shop closed.

it's strange. it was unreachable.. maybe a temporary down so,... or a joke just to panic
more.
or... BE CAREFUL the "campaign" may be alive, also for those already affected and
recovered.. better to turn off the nas for some days...

Still open 8 of may but needed a few refreshments. Not all unarchivers works. The
standard Mac unarchiver won't accept the key but download the unarchiver from App
Store to try to see that you've got the right key before you make a script file.

danynap - 1 year ago

Futher updates. I paid 0.01BTC and received the password, that works. Since few
days, the price has increased to 0.03 !! Anyway with Widows and Linux (I have this)
decrypters work fine. In case Mac has problems, try to access data through a different
machine, maybe it's easier.
