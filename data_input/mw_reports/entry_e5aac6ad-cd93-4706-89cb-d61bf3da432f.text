Russia-Sponsored Group Employs Apparently Legitimate Documents
Aligned to Growing Hostilities Between Russia and Ukraine
Authored by: Gage Mele, Yury Polozov, and Tara Gould

Key Findings
Anomali Threat Research discovered a campaign targeting Ukrainian government
officials with malicious files that could be repurposed to target government officials of
other countries.
We assess with high confidence that this activity was conducted by Russia-sponsored
cyberespionage group Primitive Bear (Gamaredon).
Primitive Bear was observed distributing .docx files that attempted to download a .dot
file via remote templates.
The campaign appears to have taken place from January through at least late March
2021, and used decoy documents themed around current events. These documents
also showed that Primitive Bear likely used unauthorized access or illicit purchase of
private documents prior to their publication.
The final objective of this campaign remains unclear because the remote template
domains were down at the time of discovery.

Overview
Anomali Threat Research identified malicious samples that align with the Russia-sponsored
cyberespionage group Primitive Bear’s (Gamaredon, Winterflounder) tactics, techniques,
and procedures (TTPs).[1] The group was distributing .docx files that attempted to download
2/15

.dot files from remote templates. The final objective of this campaign remains unclear as the
remote template domains were down at the time of discovery. We observed Primitive Bear
activity in late 2019, and again in April 2020, during which time they used similar TTPs and
Ukrainian government-themed decoys.[2] In those campaigns, Primitive Bear’s decoys
loaded a remote template to drop a .dot file that would determine if the compromised
machine was worthy of a second-stage payload.[3]
Primitive Bear, known primarily to focus on Ukraine, has been very active in 2021. However,
the themes of the samples we found, as well as those shared by the security community,
could also be used to target multiple former Union of Soviet Socialist Republic (USSR)
countries.

Details
Anomali Threat Research found malicious .docx files being distributed by Primitive Bear,
likely through spearphishing, that attempted to download remote template .dot files through
template injection. Most of the .docx decoy files were written in Ukrainian, and a minority
written in Russian, and contained content discussing multiple Ukrainian government
agencies, institutions, and public entities, as well as Russian intelligence agencies in the
context of occupied Crimea. Primitive Bear was using specific names of individuals and
entities in their files, relevant to the January through mid-March 2021 timeframe, to make
their malicious files appear more legitimate. This highlights the group’s use of authentic
events to craft likely phishing themes more likely to be effective.

Technical Analysis
The .docx files distributed by Primitive Bear used template injection to add a remote domain
that contained a .dot (Word template) file. In Figure 2, the template injection can be seen
with the TargetMode set to “External,” indicating the file was reaching out to a remote
location. If the connection was made, the .dot file was subsequently downloaded.

The final objective of this campaign remains unclear because the remote template domains
were down at the time of discovery, and we encourage the security community to share if
discovered.

Tertychna Abstract last 8.2.docx, shown above in Figures 3 and 4, is a 26 page abstract
of a Ukrainian dissertation discussing modern relations between Ukraine and Bulgaria. Most
of the document is in Ukrainian, however, the last two and one-half pages have English
summaries. Tertychna Abstract last 8.2.docx appears to be a shortened version of
another Primitive Bear file called дисертація 8.02.21.docx (from Ukrainian: Dissertation
8.02.21.docx), which was also mentioned by the security community, shown in Figures 5
and 6 below.[4]

Figure 6 – Dissertation 8.02.21.docx (Translated from Ukrainian, Page 1/282)
These two documents (автореферат Тертична last 8.2.docx and дисертація
8.02.21.docx) appear to be legitimate documents that were weaponized by Primitive Bear
for template injection. The group likely procured them through illicit purchase or previous
compromise. We found the full document was published by its author, Anna, on the
literature repository site, chtyvo.org[.]ua.[5] The file was uploaded to the site on March 7,
2021, but both of the analyzed file names suggested a date of February 8, 2021 (8.2.docx)
or called it out explicitly. This indicates that Primitive Bear has used access to private
Ukrainian documents, weaponized them, and distributed them prior to the authorized
publication of said documents.
In hindsight, the decision for Primitive Bear to use a Ukrainian and Bulgarian-themed
dissertation comes at an interesting time for Russian and Bulgarian relations. This is due to
the Bulgarian government arresting six of its own members who were charged with spying
for the Russian government, on March 19, 2021, according to the Bulgarian prosecutors’
statement.[6] However, Russia is known for combining cyber and real-world operations, and
has been using this hybrid warfare to target Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine since at least the
2014 annexation of Crimea.[7] Therefore, it would not be unlikely to think that Primitive Bear
was using Bulgaria-themed decoys before the media knew of the events, thus making the
information more relevant to Ukrainian officials who knew what was transpiring.

Figure 8 – REPORT NOTE.docx (Translated from Ukrainian) page 1/5
REPORT NOTE.docx, shown in Figures 7 and 8 above, purports to be an internal note by
the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine dated February 2021. The file includes pre-trial
investigative rulesets regarding suspected terrorists. These fighters, from unrecognized
regions of Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) and Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR), have
been accused of fighting against the Ukrainian government. Russia has been the de-facto
controller of DPR and LPR since the regions simultaneously declared their independence
from Ukraine in 2014, which makes the use of these regions ideal in decoy documents for
Primitive Bear.
The escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine in 2021 add incentive for mentioning
DPR and LPR. On January 28, 2021, DPR and LPR groups presented a doctrine dubbed
“Russian Donbass,” which stated the groups’ collective desire to rejoin Russia “in order to
return to our historical roots.”[8] In the subsequent months, European monitors reported an
10/15

increase in Russian troop movement along the Ukraine-Russia border. Tensions boiled over
in the DPR on March 30, 2021, with exchanging artillery and machine-gun fire between the
factions resulting in four Ukrainians killed and one wounded.[9] This was another strong
example of Primitive Bear samples themed around real-world conflicts before a significant
event occurred, a strong indication of potential hybrid warfare.

Figure 9 – incoming.docx

Figure 10 – incoming.docx (Translated from Russian)
The .docx file shown in Figures 9 and 10 above is a letter allegedly from Emil Variev, a
neighbor of Rustem Seytmemetov, in occupied Crimea. He referenced how Russia’s
Federal Security Service (FSB) arrested him in 2020 in relation to the Hizb ut-Tahrir
(extremist aim to unite all Muslim countries) case. Rustem Seytmemetov is just one of three
individuals who were arrested in what Crimeans refer to as “the so-called third
Bakhchisaray Hizb ut-Tahrir case,” and they are expected to remain under arrest until April
11/15

22, 2021.[10] While the decoy did not state an intended recipient, the context appears
directed towards Ukrainian authorities. This is another example of Primitive Bear using
documents to coincide with real-world events.

Conclusion
Primitive Bear is motivated by cyberespionage (data theft, information gathering), and this
campaign demonstrates their specific targeting of regional foes with what often appears to
be private documents likely obtained by illicit means. We have observed Primitive Bear
using malicious .docx files to distribute .dot files for over a year, however, the remote
template domains used in this campaign were down at the time of discovery. Therefore, the
final payload of this campaign remains unclear at the time of this writing.
