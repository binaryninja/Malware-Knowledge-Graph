After Russia, US and China, here is my mapping of known APT groups with (offensive) cyber
operations capabilities from DPRK (commonly referred to as North Korea). As always,
please let me know if you notice any mistakes, errors, or missing information since this is
supposed to be a live document, updated as soon as new information becomes available.
The sources used are listed below the diagram, similarly to the other cases.
