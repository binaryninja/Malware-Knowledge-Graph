1. Introduction
Modern civilization is largely dependent on ICS/SCADA industrial process
automation systems. The operation of nuclear power plants, hydroelectricity plants, oil
and gas pipelines, and transport systems at national and world level are based on
computer technology. Both the profit of a company and national security depend on
control systems safety.
Industry systems security gained great interest not very long ago — after a series of
incidents involving particular computer viruses, Flame and Stuxnet. It was then found that
special services of foreign countries, competitive companies or cyber-terrorists are able to
profit from the lack of attention paid to ICS/SCADA/PLC information security.
Threat modeling and imitating a potential attacker are essential in building a security
system. It is necessary to understand what skills the attacker possesses and what
scheme of attack may be chosen. In order to answer these questions, the experts of
Positive Technologies explored ICS systems security. This report consists of 2 sections:



Statistics on Vulnerabilities in the ICS Systems;
Assessment of the Popularity of ICS on the Internet.

The subject of the investigation comprises the vulnerabilities that were discovered for the
period from 2005 to October 1, 2012.

2. Conclusions
1. The history of industrial system security is divided into two parts — prior to Stuxnet
and afterwards. 20 times more vulnerabilities have been detected since 2010 comparing
with the previous five years.
ICS in Figures:
The number of detected vulnerabilities
has increased by 20 times (since 2010).
It takes more than a month to fix each
fifth vulnerability.
50% of vulnerabilities allow a hacker to
execute code.
There are exploits for 35% of
vulnerabilities.
41% of vulnerabilities are critical.
More than 40% of systems available
from the Internet can be hacked by
unprofessional users.
The third part of systems available from
the Internet is located in the USA.
The fourth part of vulnerabilities is
related to the lack of necessary security
updates.
54% and 39% of systems available from
the Internet in Europe and North
America respectively are vulnerable.

2. The number of vulnerabilities keeps on growing rapidly in
2012. The number of security flaws found within ten months is
far bigger than the number of flaws found during the whole
previous period starting from 2005.
3. Vulnerabilities are primarily detected in the most common
products, and the major part of vendors eliminate them quite
quickly. However, each fifth vulnerability wasn't fixed within 30
days from the moment of its detection.
4. About 65% of vulnerabilities are rated as of high and critical
severity. This figure significantly exceeds a similar index in IT
systems, which proves a low information security level of ICS
systems.
5. Exploitation of each second vulnerability allows an attacker
to execute arbitrary code in the target ICS system.
6. More than 40% of SCADA systems available from the
Internet are vulnerable and can be hacked by poorly trained
malware users.
7. The USA and Europe lead in the number of ICS systems
published in the Internet and demonstrate the most thoughtless
attitude towards their security comparing with other regions.

8. More than a third of security flaws of available ICS systems are caused by configuration
errors, including the use of default passwords.
9. The fourth part of vulnerabilities of available ICS systems is related to the lack of
necessary security updates.

3. Analysis of the Vulnerabilities in the ICS Systems
3.1. Research Methodology
Information from different sources (e.g. vulnerability databases, vendors’ notices,
exploit packs, science conference reports, articles published on specialized sites and blogs)
served as a basis for the research. It was necessary to analyze this broad spectrum of sources
since cooperation between the community of information security researchers and the ICS
vendors is just getting started and a lot of vulnerabilities are published without the
developers’ approval.
The main sources used in the research
Vulnerability databases:
 ICS-CERT,
 NVD,
 CVE,
 Bugtraq,
 OSVDB,
 Mitre Oval Repositories,
 exploit-db,
 Siemens Product CERT.
Exploit packs:
 SAINTexploit,
 Metasploit Framework,
 Immunity Canvas,
 Agora Pack,
 Agora SCADA+,
 D2 Exploit Pack,
 White Phosphorus exploit pack,
 VulnDisco Exploit Pack.
For each vulnerability discovered, the experts searched for generally available
methods of exploiting the vulnerability and provided an expert evaluation of the related
risks.

3.2.

Dynamics of Vulnerability Discovery

The specialists in information security discovered only 9 vulnerabilities for the period from
2005 to early 2010. Since the computer worm Stuxnet was discovered, both information
security experts and hackers have showed deep interest in the subject. As a result, 64
vulnerabilities in ICS systems were discovered by the end of 2011. Moreover, for the first 8
month of 2012, 98 vulnerabilities were announced — more than in the previous years since
2005.

A path from the discovery of vulnerabilities in
SCADA to fixing them sometimes has to be a
twisted one. During the investigation of the Stuxnet
incident, it was found that one of the exploited
vulnerabilities — a default password for MS SQL
Server — was known long ago. It was first
mentioned during the support forums in May, 2005.
The passwords were published in April, 2008. The
issue was fixed after the attack, in 2010.

Figure 2. The Number of Vulnerabilities in the ICS Systems of Various Vendors

The highest number of vulnerabilities in ICS (also true for other systems) was
discovered in the most common components. Moreover, a number of vendors changed their
approach from reactive to proactive and took resolute measures to find and fix
vulnerabilities in their products. For instance, Siemens organized a specialized department,
Siemens ProductCERT (http://www.siemens.com/corporate-technology/en/researchareas/siemens-cert-security-advisories.htm), whose main goal is to discover and fix security
issues in the company’s products. The vulnerabilities discovered by the team are also
included in the general statistics; thus the number of discovered and fixed issues is
increasing.

3.4. Vulnerabilities Relating to ICS Hardware and Software Components
Such ICS components as SCADA systems and human machine interface (HMI) are
present a significant interest for attackers: 87 and 49 vulnerabilities were discovered,
respectively, in these systems. For the reporting period, the experts discovered 20
vulnerabilities in the programmable logic controllers of different vendors.

3.5. Classification of Vulnerabilities According to Their Types and Possible
Consequences
Over a third of vulnerabilities (36%) are associated with the buffer overflow — an
anomaly where a program overruns the buffer's boundary while writing data. This defect in
security allows the attacker not only to cause premature ending of a program or freeze
(which leads to denial of service), but
also to execute arbitrary code in the

discovered in ICS is caused by the ethical
vulnerability which allow the
hackers getting involved in the process. The

3.7. Percentage of Vulnerabilities Fixed Promptly
Most security defects (81%) have been fixed rather efficiently by ICS component
vendors before they became widely known or within 30 days of uncoordinated disclosure.
Approximately every fifth vulnerability was fixed with a significant delay, or was even not
fixed in certain cases.

August 2010 note US-CERT VU#362332 was
published; it reported on a dangerous
vulnerability in the real-time system VxWorks,
which is used in industry systems. According to
HD Moore, he discovered more than 250,000
vulnerable systems which were accessible
through the Internet.

3.8. Availability of information and software to conduct attacks
If there are ready-to-use tools to exploit the vulnerability in the public domain, it is
much more possible that the attack will be conducted successfully. Now for 35% of all known
SCADA vulnerabilities exploits have been issued, which are available as single utilities, parts
of penetration testing software or are described in security bulletins.

Figure 7. Part of vulnerabilities that have exploits

Please note that 35% is rather a high value for the number of available SCADA
exploits: it is several times higher than the corresponding rate for IT systems as a whole.

3.9. Number of exploits
As a rule, the number of detected vulnerabilities correlates with the number of published
exploits. 50 exploits were published starting in 2011 and up to September 2012: this is six
times greater than the corresponding rate for the period 2005 - 2010.

The number of exploits published in 2012 is rather small. There are two possible reasons:



Relationships between SCADA vendors and explorers are put in order: responsible
disclosure policy is used;
There is a clear lag between the publication of vulnerability details and the
publication of exploits (certain costs are incurred to develop exploitation tools).

3.10. Risk levels of detected vulnerabilities
A great number of vulnerabilities (about 65%) are of high or critical level1.

Figure 3. SCADA vulnerabilties by risk level

If there are no methods to conduct the attack, the possibility that SCADA components by
SEL, Lantronix, Emerson and Invensys will be attacked is lower, but is not ruled out. As a rule,
an attack against an industrial enterprise is a kind of multi-move game played by
experienced experts who do not need “exploit packs” and other tools intended for
“ordinary” hackers.

Information about the ICS accessible through
the Internet is being published constantly on
Twitter @ntisec. More than 2,000 SCADA IP
addresses located in different regions over the
world have once been posted on Pastebin.com

SCADA Safety in Numbers

3.11. SCADA non-fixed vulnerabilities
Vulnerabilities for which there are already means of attack, but no means of
resistance, provide the greatest risk. If there is a vulnerability and a fix has not been issued,
the risk that the system can be compromised is rather high, as an attacker does not need
deep knowledge and a protracted period to prepare for the attack. Moreover, the attack can
be conducted by hooligans. The most grievous situation concerns Schneider Electric SCADA
components, where six vulnerabilities were detected. The second place goes to General
Electric (3 vulnerabilities); the third and fourth places are between Advantech/Broadwin and
Rockwell Automation, with one open vulnerability.

4. Popularity of ICS in the Internet
To understand to what extent the vulnerabilities described above can be used by an
attacker, the Internet has been assessed in relation to vulnerable ICS. Passive analysis
together with search engines (Google, Yahoo, Bing) and specialized databases such as
ShodanHQ, Every Routable IP Project were employed to search and check system versions.
The obtained information was analyzed from the point of view of vulnerabilities related to
configuration management and updates installation.
Unfortunately, the passive technique cannot be reliable in identifying all detected
vulnerabilities, that is why the major part of the information in this section should be
considered as a positive script: in case of a detailed analysis, the number of detected
vulnerabilities will certainly increase.

4.1. Frequency of ICS Systems
Almost the third part of the ICS systems, which elements can be accessed from the
Internet, are located in the USA (31.3%). Italy follows far behind (6.8%), South Korea rounds
out the top three (6.2%). Russia holds the 12th place with 2.3%, and only 1.1% of ICS systems
available from the global network are located in China.

At least 42% of ICS systems available from the Internet contain vulnerabilities, which
can be easily exploited by an attacker. Almost the same number of systems (41%) are
exposed to risk, but as it was mentioned above passive analysis is far from being reliable in
identifying vulnerabilities detected in them. Therefore, a significant part of vulnerable ICS
systems may hide in this unreachable area. The systems, which were proved secure in the
course of the research, comprise only 17%.
