Earlier this week, we published our report on “Red October”, a high-level cyber-espionage
campaign that during the past five years has successfully infiltrated computer networks at
diplomatic, governmental and scientific research organizations.
In part one, we covered the most important parts of the campaign: the anatomy of the attack,
a timeline of the attacker’s operation, the geographical distribution of the victims, sinkhole
information and presented a high level overview of the C&C infrastructure.
Today we are publishing part two of our research, which comprises over 140 pages of
technical analysis of the modules used in the operation.
When analyzing targeted attacks, sometimes researchers focus on the superficial system
infection and how that occurred. Sometimes, that is sufficient, but in the case of Kaspersky
Lab, we have higher standards. This is why our philosophy is that it’s important to analyze
not just the infection, but to answer three very important questions:
What happens to the victim after they’re infected?
What information is being stolen?
Why is “Red October” such a big deal compared to other campaigns like Aurora or
Night Dragon?

According to our knowledge, never before in the history of ITSec has an cyber-espionage
operation been analyzed in such deep detail, with a focus on the modules used for attack
and data exfiltration. In most cases, the analysis is compromised by the lack of access to the
victim’s data; the researchers see only some of the modules and do not understand the full
purpose of the attack or what was stolen.
To get around these hiccups, we set up several fake victims around the world and monitored
how the attackers handled them over the course of several months. This allowed us to
collect hundreds of attack modules and tools. In addition to these, we identified many other
modules used in other attacks, which allowed us to gain a unique insight into the attack.

The research that we are publishing today is perhaps the biggest malware research paper
ever. It is certainly the most complex malware research effort in the history of our company
and we hope that it sets new standards for what anti-virus and anti-malware research means
today.
Because of its size, we’ve split “part 2” in several pieces, to make reading easier:

4/11

First stage of attack
1. Exploits
2. Dropper
3. Loader Module
4. Main component

Second stage of attack
1. Modules, general overview
2. Recon group
3. Password group
4. Email group
5. USB drive group
6. Keyboard group
7. Persistence group
8. Spreading group
9. Mobile group
10. Exfiltration group

Reports

Kimsuky’s GoldDragon cluster and its C2 operations
Kimsuky (also known as Thallium, Black Banshee and Velvet Chollima) is a prolific and
active threat actor primarily targeting Korea-related entities. In early 2022, we observed this
group was attacking the media and a think-tank in South Korea.

VileRAT: DeathStalker’s continuous strike at foreign and cryptocurrency
exchanges
VileRAT is a Python implant, part of an evasive and highly intricate attack campaign against
foreign exchange and cryptocurrency trading companies.

Andariel deploys DTrack and Maui ransomware
Earlier, the CISA published an alert related to a Stairwell report, “Maui Ransomware.” Our
data should openly help solidify the attribution of the Maui ransomware incident to the
Korean-speaking APT Andariel, also known as Silent Chollima and Stonefly.

Targeted attack on industrial enterprises and public institutions
Kaspersky ICS CERT experts detected a wave of targeted attacks in several East European
countries, as well as Afghanistan. Of the six backdoors identified on infected systems, five
have been used earlier in attacks attributed to APT TA428.
