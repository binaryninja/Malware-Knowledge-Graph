Patchwork APT caught in its own web
Posted: Jan u ary 7, 2022 by Th reat In telligen ce Team

Patchwork is an Indian threat actor that has been active since December 2015 and usually targets Pakistan via spear phishing attacks. In its most recent campaign from late
November to early December 2021, Patchwork has used malicious RTF Ô¨Åles to drop a variant of the BADNEWS (Ragnatela) Remote Administration Trojan (RAT).
What is interesting among victims of this latest campaign, is that the actor has for the Ô¨Årst time targeted several faculty members whose research focus is on molecular
medicine and biological science.
Instead of focusing entirely on victimology, we decided to shade some light on this APT. Ironically, all the information we gathered was possible thanks to the threat actor
infecting themselves with their own RAT, resulting in captured keystrokes and screenshots of their own computer and virtual machines.

Ragnatela
We identiÔ¨Åed what we believe is a new variant of the BADNEWS RAT called Ragnatela being distributed via spear phishing emails to targets of interest in Pakistan.
Ragnatela, which means spider web in Italian, is also the project name and panel used by Patchwork APT.

Figure 1: Patchwork‚Äôs Ragnatela panel

Ragnatela RAT was built sometime in late November as seen in its Program Database (PDB) path ‚ÄúE:\new_ops\jlitest __change_ops -29no ‚Äì Copy\Release\jlitest.pdb‚Äù. It
features the following capabilities:
Executing commands via cmd
Capturing screenshots
Logging Keystrokes
Collecting list of all the Ô¨Åles in victim‚Äôs machine
Collecting list of the running applications in the victim‚Äôs machine at a speciÔ¨Åc time periods
Downing addition payloads
Uploading Ô¨Åles

Figure 2: Ragnatela commands

In order to distribute the RAT onto victims, Patchwork lures them with documents impersonating Pakistani authorities. For example, a document called EOIForm.rtf was
uploaded by the threat actor onto their own server at karachidha[.]org/docs/.

Figure 3: Threat actor is logged into their web control panel

That Ô¨Åle contains an exploit (Microsoft Equation Editor) which is meant to compromise the victim‚Äôs computer and execute the Ô¨Ånal payload (RAT).

Figure 4: Malicious document triggers exploit

That payload is stored within the RTF document as an OLE object. We can deduce the Ô¨Åle was created on December 9 2021 based on the source path information.

Figure 5: OLE object containing RAT

Ragnatela RAT communicates with the attacker‚Äôs infrastructure via a server located at bgre.kozow[.]com. Prior to launching this campaign (in late November), the threat
actor tested that their server was up and running properly.

The RAT (jli.dll) was also tested in late November before its Ô¨Ånal compilation on 2021-12-09, along with MicroScMgmt.exe used to side-load it.

Victims and victim
We were able to gain visibility on the victims that were successfully compromised:
Ministry of Defense- Government of Pakistan
National Defense University of Islam Abad
Faculty of Bio-Science, UVAS University, Lahore, Pakistan
International center for chemical and biological sciences
HEJ Research institute of chemistry, International center for chemical and biological sciences, univeristy of Karachi
SHU University, Molecular medicine
Another ‚Äì unintentional ‚Äì victim is the threat actor himself which appears to have infected is own development machine with the RAT. We can see them running both
VirtualBox and VMware to do web development and testing. Their main host has dual keyboard layouts (English and Indian).

Figure 9: Virtual machine running on top of threat actor‚Äôs main computer

Other information that can be obtained is that the weather at the time was cloudy with 19 degrees and that they haven‚Äôt updated their Java yet. On a more serious note, the
threat actor uses VPN Secure and CyberGhost to mask their IP address.

Under the VPN they log into their victim‚Äôs email and other accounts stolen by the RAT.

Conclusion
This blog gave an overview of the latest campaign from the Patchwork APT. While they continue to use the same lures and RAT, the group has shown interest in a new kind
of target. Indeed this is the Ô¨Årst time we have observed Patchwork targeting molecular medicine and biological science researchers.
Thanks to data captured by the threat actor‚Äôs own malware, we were able to get a better understanding about who sits behind the keyboard. The group makes use of virtual
machines and VPNs to both develop, push updates and check on their victims. Patchwork, like some other East Asian APTs is not as sophisticated as their Russian and
North Korean counterparts.
