A ransomware called BlackRouter has been discovered being promoted as a Ransomwareas-a-Service on Telegram by an Iranian developer. This same actor previousl distributed
another ransomware called Blackheart and promotes other infections such as a RAT.

program and keyloggers on victim's computers.

BlackRouter/Blackheart Ransomware
In early January, a new version of the BlackRouter Ransomware was discovered by a
security researcher named Petrovic, who shared the sample on Twitter. Furthermore,
MalwareHunterTeam stated that this was basically the same as the previous variant, but
with a better looking GUI and the addition of a timer.

Soon after BlackRouter was discovered, another security researcher named A Shadow told
BleepingComputer that this ransomware was being promoted as a RaaS in a hacking
channel on Telegram by an Iranian developer.

BlackRouter Promotion on Telegram
Affiliates who join this RaaS and distribute the BlackRouter ransomware will earn 80% of
any paid ransom payments, with the other 20% going to the BlackRouter developer.
In addition, this actor is promoting a remote access Trojan called BlackRat that allegedly
includes features such as encrypted communications, AV evasion, small size, plugins, the
ability to enable RDP, configure a miner, steal cryptocurrency wallets, keylogger, passwordstealer, and more.

BlackRat Promotion

BlackRouter does not seem to be heavily distributed, with only one submission to ID
Ransomware since December 31.
With that said, ransomware like BlackRouter is commonly distributed via hacking into
Remote Desktop Services or through fake cracks and downloads. Therefore, make sure to
not allow RDP to connect directly to the Internet and be sure to scan anything you
download from an untrusted source.
