ESET has discovered a Linux variant of the KillDisk component that renders Linux machines unbootable, while encrypting files and
requesting a large ransom at the same time.
ESET has discovered a Linux variant of the KillDisk component that renders Linux machines unbootable, while encrypting files and
requesting a large ransom at the same time.
ESET researchers have discovered a Linux variant of the KillDisk malware that was used in Ukraine in attacks against the country’s critical
infrastructure in late 2015 and against a number of targets within its financial sector in December 2016. This new variant renders Linux
machines unbootable, after encrypting files and requesting a large ransom. But even if victims do reach deep into their pockets, the
probability that the attackers will decrypt the files is small.

KillDisk – from wiping to encrypting
KillDisk is a destructive malware that gained notoriety as a component of successful attacks performed by the BlackEnergy group against the
Ukrainian power grid in December 2015 and attacks against one of the country’s main news agencies in November 2015. More recently, we
detected cyber-sabotage attacks utilizing KillDisk against a number of different targets within the financial sector in Ukraine planned for
December 6, 2016. At that time, a group, which we dubbed as TeleBots, had utilized a different set of tools, abusing the popular Telegram
messenger service.
KillDisk attack campaigns continued throughout December, aimed at several targets in the sea transportation sector in Ukraine. The attack
toolset has evolved as well – attackers now make use of Meterpreter backdoors and C&C communication no longer travels through Telegram
API.
While the December 6th KillDisk variants were quite artistic and displayed a screen referring to the popular Mr. Robot show on television,
recent variants add a more sinister feature – file-encrypting ransomware. The ransom message begins with a provocative “we are so sorry…”
and demands that the victim pay an exceptionally high ransom in return for the encrypted files – 222 Bitcoin, which is approximately USD
250,000 at the time of writing.

These recent ransomware KillDisk variants are not only able to target Windows systems, but also Linux machines, which is certainly
something we don’t see every day. This may include not only Linux workstations but also servers, amplifying the damage potential.
The Windows variants, detected by ESET as Win32/KillDisk.NBK and Win32/KillDisk.NBL, encrypt files with AES (256-bit encryption key
generated using CryptGenRandom) and the symmetric AES key is then encrypted using 1024-bit RSA. In order not to encrypt files twice, the
malware adds the following marker to the end of each encrypted file: DoN0t0uch7h!$CrYpteDfilE.

In both Windows and Linux variants, the ransom message is exactly the same, including the ransom amount – BTC 222, Bitcoin address, and
contact email.

Linux/KillDisk.A technical analysis
While the ransom details for both platforms are identical, the technical implementation is, obviously, different. The ransom message is
displayed in an unusual manner – within the GRUB bootloader. When the malware executes, the bootloader entries are overwritten in order to
display the ransom text.
The main encryption routine recursively traverses the following folders within the root directory up to 17 subdirectories in depth:
/boot
/bin
/sbin
/lib/security
/lib64/security
/usr/local/etc
/etc
/mnt
/share
/media
/home
/usr
/tmp
/opt
/var
/root
Files are encrypted using Triple-DES applied to 4096-byte file blocks. Each file is encrypted using a different set of 64-bit encryption keys.

After a reboot, the affected system will be unbootable.
It is important to note – that paying the ransom demanded for the recovery of encrypted files is a waste of time and money. The encryption
keys generated on the affected host are neither saved locally nor sent to a C&C server.
Let us emphasize that – the cyber criminals behind this KillDisk variant cannot supply their victims with the decryption keys to recover their
files, despite those victims paying the extremely large sum demanded by this ransomware.
Moreover, ESET researchers have noted a weakness in the encryption employed in the Linux version of ransomware, which makes recovery
possible, albeit difficult. (Note that this does not apply to the Windows version.)

Conclusion – why ransomware?
While monitoring the BlackEnergy and TeleBots cyberattacks, we have observed an interesting evolution of the simple but destructive KillDisk
component. Over the years we’ve detected attack campaigns against many different targets across various segments, including state
institutions and critical infrastructure, many of them unrelated. The group (or groups) of attackers behind these operations has had an interest
in various platforms – whether it was Windows PCs controlling SCADA/ICS systems, or workstations in a media agency. With this latest
expansion, attackers can use KillDisk to destroy files on Linux systems. Nonetheless, any ties between orchestrators of these attacks remain
unclear and purely circumstantial.
The recent addition of ransomware functionality seems a bit unusual, as previous attacks were cyber-espionage and cyber-sabotage
operations. Considering the high ransom of around USD 250,000 – resulting in a low probability that victims would pay up, in addition to the
fact that the attackers have not implemented an efficient way of decrypting the files, this seems more like a nail in the coffin, rather than a true
ransomware campaign.
Whatever the true explanation, our advice still holds – if you’ve become a victim of ransomware, don’t pay up, since there’s no guarantee of
getting your data back. The only safe way of dealing with ransomware is prevention – education, keeping systems updated and fully patched,
using a reputable security solution, keeping backups and testing the ability to restore.
