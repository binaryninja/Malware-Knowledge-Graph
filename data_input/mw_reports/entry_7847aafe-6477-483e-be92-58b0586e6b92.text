CrowdStrike Launches Free Tool to Identify and Help Mitigate Risks
in Azure Active Directory
December 23, 2020
Michael Sentonas From The Front Lines

Executive Summary
CrowdStrike launches CrowdStrike Reporting Tool for Azure (CRT), a free community
tool that will help organizations quickly and easily review excessive permissions in
their Azure AD environments, help determine configuration weaknesses, and provide
advice to mitigate risk.
CrowdStrike has observed the challenges that organizations face auditing Azure AD
permissions, which is a time-consuming and complex process.

CrowdStrike conducted an extensive review of our production and internal
environments and found no impact.
CrowdStrike does not have any attribution and does not know of any connection to
SUNBURST at this time.
Companies and governments around the world are facing one of the most advanced and
far-reaching attacks in recent history. This is clearly a sophisticated operation carried out
over a long period of time. The motivations and true extent of how far reaching this
campaign has been will be better understood by the security industry and authorities in
weeks, maybe months to come. Customer security and transparency are CrowdStrike’s top
priority. We have conducted an extensive review of our production and internal
environments and found no impact.
Whilst doing our review, CrowdStrike was contacted by the Microsoft Threat Intelligence
Center on December 15, 2020. Specifically, they identified a reseller’s Microsoft Azure
account used for managing CrowdStrike’s Microsoft Office licenses was observed making
abnormal calls to Microsoft cloud APIs during a 17-hour period several months ago. There
was an attempt to read email, which failed as confirmed by Microsoft. As part of our secure
IT architecture, CrowdStrike does not use Office 365 email.
CrowdStrike conducted a thorough review into not only our Azure environment, but all of
our infrastructure for the indicators shared by Microsoft. The information shared by
Microsoft reinforced our conclusion that CrowdStrike suffered no impact.
Throughout our analysis, we experienced first hand the difficulties customers face in
managing Azure’s administrative tools to know what relationships and permissions exist
within Azure tenants, particularly with third-party partner/resellers, and how to quickly
enumerate them. We found it particularly challenging that many of the steps required to
investigate are not documented, there was an inability to audit via API, and there is the
requirement for global admin rights to view important information which we found to be
excessive. Key information should be easily accessible.
In our role supporting organizations impacted by the SUNBURST incident, the CrowdStrike
Services team has created a community tool called CrowdStrike Reporting Tool for Azure
(CRT) to quickly and easily pull up these excessive permissions and other important
information about your Azure AD environment. This includes delegated permissions and
application permissions, Federation configurations, Federation trusts, mail forwarding rules,
Service Principals, objects with KeyCredentials, and more. Of note, due to the lack of
documentation of Microsoft API capabilities, CRT does not pull critical information regarding
partner tenant permissions, which includes delegated admin access. We have detailed
steps below enabling you to view this critical information manually in the Microsoft 365
admin center; this is also documented in the CRT readme.

2/11

We have made this tool available to the community in our CrowdStrike github
repository. We recommend that all Azure AD administrators review their Azure AD
configuration to help determine if they have been impacted and take steps to prevent
intrusions. We hope this tool will assist organizations around the world.
We would like to thank Microsoft for sharing this abnormal behavior and associated IOCs.
We strongly recommend all organizations leverage CRT to review their Azure tenants and
understand if they need to take any configuration or mitigation steps, particularly as it
relates to third-parties that may be present in your Azure environment. Additionally, it is
critical to ensure you review your partner/reseller access, and you mandate multi-factor
authentication (MFA) for your partner tenant if you determine it has not been configured.
One of the reasons why these attack vectors are so difficult to mitigate is the inherent
complexities that organizations face with federated SSO infrastructure and in managing
Azure tenants. We hope the findings and recommendations from our experience help your
organization.

Introducing the CrowdStrike Reporting Tool for Azure
Prerequisites and Deployment
CRT uses PowerShell and automatically installs the Exchange Online PowerShell V2,
MSOnline, and AzureAD modules. While we recommend that this tool be run with an
account with Global Reader privileges, certain read-only functions nonetheless require
authentication as a user with Global Admin or similarly high-risk privileges. When Global
Admin privileges are not available, the tool will notify you about what information won’t be
available to you as a result.

Additional Recommendations
Based on incident response engagements conducted by the CrowdStrike Services team, I
want to highlight some additional attack surface and mitigation recommendations.

Logging
CrowdStrike recommends centralizing storage of logs in a secure location to prevent
tampering, unauthorized access, and forensic preservation. Certain log sources must be
enabled and diagnostic settings need to be added for sufficient detail to be available. If
these additional settings are not configured, the relevant events will not be captured.
At a minimum, the following logs should be captured in a Security Incident Event
Management (SIEM) system or log storage environment separate from Azure:
Unified Audit Log
Azure Activity Logs
Azure Services Logs
Azure NSG Flow Logs
Azure AD Logs:
Azure AD Audit Logs
Azure AD Sign-In Logs
Azure AD Managed Identity Sign-In Logs (Preview)
Azure AD Non-Interactive User Sign-In Logs (Preview)
Azure AD Service Principal Sign-In Logs (Preview)
Azure AD Provisioning Logs
Azure AD Risky Sign-In events

Configuration Review and Hardening Measures
CrowdStrike recommends reviewing tenant configurations and applying the hardening
measures below as applicable.

Tenant
Review trust relationships with partners including IT consultants, vendors and
resellers and limit privileges. Partner role information is available to Global Admin
accounts at this link https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home#/partners. This
information does not appear to be available through documented APIs.
Review existing Federations. Identify unauthorized or unrecognized Federations and
revoke them.
Store SAML token signing certificate key material in a Hardware Security Module
(HSM) so that the signing key cannot be stolen. Alternatively, rotate SAML signing
certificates periodically.
Review Azure AD allowed identity providers (SAML IDPs through direct federation or
social logins) and identify and remove those that are not legitimate.
Review Azure B2B external identities’ access to the Azure portal and identify and
remove those that are no longer needed or not legitimate.

5/11

Ensure only required on-premises AD Organizational Units (OUs) and objects are
being synced to the cloud. Use extreme caution when establishing bi-directional trust
and syncing privileged identities, service accounts, or OUs between on-premise and
cloud.
Implement Azure Policies to restrict specific actions in the tenant.
Restrict Region Usage
Enforce tagging for sensitive resources
Review access controls to the Azure administrator portal, using least privilege access
principles.
Review environment for overly privileged service accounts that may have access to
on-prem environments as well as Azure and reduce privileges and access if possible.

Azure ADOAuth Applications
Review existing applications with credentials recently added.
Review non-Microsoft registered applications and permissions, and revoke
permissions and credentials for any unrecognized application.
Review and remove unused applications.
Limit application consent policy to only approved administrators.

Entitlements Review
Ensure that only dedicated cloud-only administrator accounts are used for cloud
administration.
Practice the principle of least privilege and remove unnecessary privileges where
warranted.
Review users granted membership in administrative roles or groups:
Users with elevated permissions via the following roles should be given extra
scrutiny:
Authentication Administrator
Billing Administrator
Conditional Access Administrator
E-Discovery Manager and Administrator
Exchange Administrator
Global Administrator
Helpdesk Administrator
Password Administrator
Security Administrator
SharePoint Administrator
User Access Administrator
User Administrator
Review privileges and enforce multi-factor authentication requirements for Guest
users.
6/11

Ensure only the appropriate users have Azure CLI access to the tenant.

Authentication
Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users.
Check for new unknown MFA registrations and restrict service accounts from MFA
registration.
Set the multi-factor authentication access policy to “Do not allow users to create app
passwords to sign in to non-browser apps” to prevent bypassing MFA.
Review and enforce Conditional Access Policies:
Utilize geo-fencing and/or trusted locations.
Enforce modern authentication and blocking of legacy authentication.
Block “risky sign-ins” with medium severity and above.
Monitor authentication requests from unknown identity providers.
Monitor for credentials being added to service principals.
Ensure Self Service Password Reset (SSPR) requests are enabled to notify users
when their passwords are changed.

Exchange
Review mailbox forwarding rules and remove unauthorized rules, including:
Tenant-wide mail flow rules
Individual mailboxes
Review mailbox delegations and remove unnecessary delegations.
Ensure Exchange PowerShell usage is only permitted for Exchange Administrators.

Harden On-Premise and Self-Managed Systems
It is important to highlight the need to harden on-premise systems as well as cloud and
datacenter-hosted systems for which the organization is ultimately responsible. Based on
current intelligence, the ability of this adversary to be successful depends on the initial
compromise of hosts configured by or for the organization along with its partners, including
hosts in public clouds. Privileged users, roles and organizational units should be synced
between cloud and on-premises or self-managed directories with extreme caution. Cloud
admin roles must rely on cloud-only authentication and not authenticate with SAML SSO,
just as admin roles for on-premises / self managed must not be authenticated through cloud
services.

Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Solution
Deploy Endpoint Detection and Response solution, such as Falcon Insight, to provide
visibility and prevention across the enterprise endpoints and cloud workloads.

Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)
7/11

Monitor Azure using a Cloud Security Posture Management solution such as Falcon
Horizon.

Implement Risk Based Conditional Access Everywhere
Achieve unified visibility and adaptive enforcement for both on-premises and in the cloud
resources to secure access based on context and use enforcement to prevent identity
based threats in real time using a solution like Falcon Zero Trust. This includes protecting
legacy systems, unmanaged devices, and all accounts types (privileged, employee, remote,
and service).

Privileged Identity Management (PIM)
Implement Privileged Identity Management solution to be utilized to limit exposure to
administrative permissions by providing just-in-time access. Falcon Zero Trust can also help
extend core PIM functionality to systems that require risk based conditional access when
PIM is not feasible for all applications, workloads, and privileged users.

Enforce Mail Encryption and Signing
Enforcing end-to-end email encryption and signing can help to prevent unauthorized access
and verify the authenticity of the communication.

Security Email Gateway Solution
Having a secure email gateway solution will provide protection, visibility, and data
protection.

Mail DNS Controls
Implementing SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records will ensure email authenticity, prevent
spoofing, and provide visibility.

Conduct Organizational Phishing Campaign and Trainings
Regular phishing exercises and awareness training can assist employees to recognize,
avoid, and report potential threats that could compromise the environment.

Note: On December 24, 2020 the US Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity &
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released a new tool, Sparrow.ps1, to help network
admins secure their Microsoft 365-based infrastructure following the recent reports that
hackers have been exploiting Microsoft 365 to compromise commercial and sensitive
