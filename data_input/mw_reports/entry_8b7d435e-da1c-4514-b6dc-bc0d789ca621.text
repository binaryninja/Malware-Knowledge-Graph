Removing Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior

April 7, 2022

We removed two separate networks for violating our policy against coordinated
inauthentic behavior (CIB). One of these networks originated in China and the other in
the Philippines.
In each case, the people behind this activity coordinated with one another and used fake
accounts as a central part of their operations to mislead people about who they are and what
they are doing, and that was the basis for our action. When we investigate and remove these
operations, we focus on behavior rather than content, no matter who’s behind them, what
they post, or whether they’re foreign or domestic.
Over the past three years, we’ve shared our findings about coordinated inauthentic behavior
we detect and remove from our platforms. Earlier this year, we started publishing regular CIB
reports where we share information about the networks we take down over the course of
each month to make it easier for people to see progress we’re making in one place. In some
1/10

cases, like today, we also share our findings soon after our enforcement. The takedowns we
are announcing today will also be included in our September report. You can find more
information about our previous CIB enforcement actions here.
We are making progress rooting out this abuse, but as we’ve said before, it’s an ongoing
effort. We’re committed to continually improving to stay ahead.
WHAT WE FOUND
(We will update the numbers as soon as the latest data becomes available)
We removed 155 accounts, 11 Pages, 9 Groups and 6 Instagram accounts for violating
our policy against foreign or government interference which is coordinated
inauthentic behavior on behalf of a foreign or government entity. This activity
originated in China and focused primarily on the Philippines and Southeast Asia more
broadly, and also on the United States.
We identified several clusters of connected activity that relied on fake accounts to pose as
locals in countries they targeted, post in Groups, amplify their own content, manage Pages,
like and comment on other people’s posts particularly about naval activity in the South China
Sea, including US Navy ships. This campaign took operational security steps to conceal their
identity and location including through the use of VPNs. Some of this network’s Pages were
previously removed for violating our inauthentic behavior and spam policies.
In Southeast Asia where this network focused most of its activity, they posted in Chinese,
Filipino and English about global news and current events including Beijing’s interests in the
South China Sea; Hong Kong; content supportive of President Rodrigo Duterte and Sarah
Duterte’s potential run in the 2022 Presidential election; criticism of Rappler, an independent
news organization in the Philippines; issues relevant to the overseas Filipino workers; and
praise and some criticism of China. In the US, where this network focused the least and
gained almost no following, they posted content both in support of and against presidential
candidates Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden and Donald Trump.
We found this network as part of our internal investigation into suspected coordinated
inauthentic behavior in the region. Although the people behind this activity attempted to
conceal their identities and coordination, our investigation found links to individuals in the
Fujian province of China.

Where is your shame Drilon? Right now you are a nuisance you did nothing but harass and
talk nonsense things.
You did nothing but oppose!
You don’t think anything but personal interest only..

We also removed 64 Facebook accounts, 32 Pages and 33 Instagram accounts for
violating our policy against foreign or government interference which is coordinated
inauthentic behavior on behalf of a foreign or government entity. This network
originated in in the Philippines and focused on domestic audiences. (Updated on
October 12, 2020 at 6:35PM PT to reflect the latest enforcement numbers.)
This network consisted of several clusters of connected activity that relied on fake accounts
to evade enforcement, post content, comment and manage Pages. This operation appeared
to have accelerated between 2019 and 2020. They posted in Filipino and English about local
news and events including domestic politics, military activities against terrorism, pending
anti-terrorism bill, criticism of communism, youth activists and opposition, the Communist
Party of the Philippines and its military wing the New People’s Army, and the National
Democratic Front of the Philippines.
We found the full scope of this activity after investigating information about a portion of this
network brought to our attention by civil society in the Philippines and Rappler, an
independent news organization in the Philippines. Although the people behind this activity
attempted to conceal their identities, our investigation found links to Philippine military and
Philippine police.
Presence on Facebook and Instagram: 64 Facebook accounts, 32 Pages and 33
Instagram accounts (Updated on October 12, 2020 at 6:35PM PT to reflect the
latest enforcement numbers.)

5,500 people followed one of more of these Instagram accounts. (Updated on

Advertising: Around $1,300 in spending for ads on Facebook paid for in Philippine

any organizations of the terrorist CPP-NPA-NDF is suicide because it is like slowly
approaching your death. Which is why my fellow country men, be smart and do not be
deceived by the terrorist CPP-NPA-NDF, because they take delight in Filipino citizens joining
their cause. Please share! Text overlay: Joining any organizations of CPP-NPA-NDF is like
