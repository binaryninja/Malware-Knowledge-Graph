Edit: In fact after looking at the sample it's a pure copy pasta of Tiny Nuke :) cd025523e3aec57f809552b9d1adc4b89526cc632f6d4c481aa2c8c3501dda6b Hi, it's time for
a new post. Today I'll try to have a look at the "Team NZMR" I've found this funny team by
hazard on Twitter via the bot @ScumBots

I would like to write this little blog post because I think that this is interesting to see an Alina
panel behind a .onion domain and as you can see later, I like look at some weird panels :D.
Let's have a look on this server. As we know, we have an Alina (Well known POS malware)
panel at thzsmrjqqzpaz2mz.onion.link/al/loading.php . Samples:
26aa9709d0402157d9d36e4849b1f9bacecd8875169c7f26d7d40c5c0c3de298
(http://thzsmrjqqzpaz2mz.onion.link/al/Spark.exe)

In the same boring way, we can found:
a Fareit/Pony panel at https://thzsmrjqqzpaz2mz.onion.link/pn/admin.php (I
don't have sample)
an Atmos at https://thzsmrjqqzpaz2mz.onion.link/at/cp.php : Sample

(https://thzsmrjqqzpaz2mz.onion.link/at/files/us.exe)

Thanks to CCAM we can get 2 new servers used by this team:
http://netco1000.ddns.net/at/file.php
http://22klzn6kzjlwlmt2.onion.link/at/file.php
Those guys really want your creds and your credit card numbers :D They also try to deal with
ransomware (NZMR Ransomware) at https://thzsmrjqqzpaz2mz.onion.link/ed2/
without success...

2/9

But I've write this quick blog post for the last panel, Let me introduce you XBOT panel \o/:
https://thzsmrjqqzpaz2mz.onion.link/panel/ (click to enlarge)

The bot ad: Selling xbot ,new bank trojan -- Modules -- Webinject -Formgrabber -- Socket4/5 -- Hidden VNC New bot bank xbot is available for
rent (800$/monthly) -- server on tornetwork/clearnet Customized programming
service and web developer/c/c++/Python/NET/others Team Coder/NZMR xbot costs
3k $ modules available >webinject -- formgrabber -- Socket4/5 -- Hidden VNC
When buying xbot what do you get? You will get the
builder,bin/exe+socket.exe/server.exe hvnc [+] - Free installation on your
server in tornetwork or clearnet, you choose [+] - monthly support paid 100

3/9

$ (you choose,with or without support) [+] - Update bot for new version 400
$ [+] Rent xbot Panel access (Clearnet/Tornetwork) Bin (exe)
Socket.exe/hvnc.exe Priçe 800 $ monthly (First 6 customers, others 1k $)

I don't have any sample yet but if you have one, i'm
REALLY interrested :D. Thanks to Xylitol this panel looks like a mix between Alina and
Dexter. For example the URI scheme "/front/stats.php", the successstatuscode 666 or this
page "Version Control":
Support monthly 100 $ (btc)

This panel looks designed for Banking stuff (webinjects) and POS malware. From XBOT
panel you can DL/Exec, Start VNC sessions, socks sessions and update bots:

We can also found some strange "webinjects" stuff:

5/9

where "view content" leads to these kinds of data:

6/9

Some settings (look at the Alinas 666 status code):

You can also add some bins in the panel database. Currently, they have 8472 Bins in the
database. And finally the bot lists (~600 bots if I trust the bots list).

7/9

I've uploaded the whole list of bots on this album. Ping me if you're on the list :D I'm really
curious to see the binary part And finally the database structure reminds again Alina: By this
way we will find soon more Alina forks than Zeus forks \o/ So, NOPE! it's not a super new
next gen POS malware, it's just another Alina Fork :D but this webinjects part looks curious :)
and the team seems very active. But come one, 3k$ for open sourced malware haha...
Thanks for your time, thanks to Xylitol and happy hunting :) IOCs:
