CEO/Founder SinaCyber, Former FBI and CrowdStrike
Testimony before the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission Hearing on
“China’s Cyber Capabilities: Warfare, Espionage, and Implications for the United States”

Introduction
Members of the commission, thank you for inviting me to appear before you today to discuss the
threat posed by cyber espionage operations carried out by the People’s Republic of China
(PRC). I have been asked specifically to comment on China’s cyber espionage goals and the
Ministry of State Security’s (MSS) role in achieving them. My testimony will examine the MSS’s
rise in cyber espionage capabilities, timelines of important evolutions in the PRC’s intelligence
collection strategy, similarities and separation of roles played by both the MSS and the People’s
Liberation Army (PLA), and the threats it poses to the United States and its allies. In particular, I
will use two recent US Department of Justice indictments to illustrate the history and breadth of
cyber operations carried out by MSS contractors, and why their future ability to continue these
operations is of grave concern. Finally, I will submit several recommendations on steps
Congress can take to combat this threat.

Rise of the MSS-Contractor Model
This testimony will illustrate how the MSS’s model of using a combination of in-house talent and
cyber contractors has won the CCP’s favor for engaging in economic-driven cyber espionage. A
combination of external factors and internal decisions made throughout the early 2000s made
this model preferable to the PLA’s former 3rd Department’s (3PLA) historically noisier
operations and past mistakes. These include:

A long-planned PLA reorganization conveniently announced at the end of 2015 at a time
when Sino-US tensions over cyber espionage were at their highest
Additional time to combine the capabilities of the 3PLA, responsible for the military’s
signals intelligence (SIGINT), and the 4th Department (4PLA), responsible for the PLA’s
EW capabilities
Successive public exposures of 3PLA units by US private sector cybersecurity firms
Less corruption and moonlighting activities among the MSS due to an earlier disciplinary
investigation period done during Xi Jinping’s first years
Better integration among State-owned Enterprises (SOEs) & private sector
No military commissioning (PT training, dorms, etc.) enabling easier recruitment
MSS 13th Bureau’s (CNITSEC) integration into the vulnerability mining ecosystem,
providing better exploits and tooling
Cover & domestic surveillance capabilities provided by Ministry of Public Security (MPS)
Superior provincial recruiting of lead figures in underground hacking groups
Ability to run domestic cyber conferences and leverage recruitment opportunities
Plausible deniability

What is uniquely concerning about the threat posed to the US and its allies by the MSS is the
blind eye it turns on contract hackers engaging in criminal activity for personal profit in exchange
for collection of intelligence priorities, and its ability to leverage China’s excellent vulnerability
mining ecosystem to hoard exploits for cyber operations. In addition, MSS-affiliated actors such

as TURBINE PANDA/APT26 and WICKED PANDA/APT41 have engaged in increasingly
brazen big data collection operations (such as OPM), which has been proven to be used by the
MSS in future targeting operations. In total, these make the MSS a unique cyber adversary that
in many ways has surpassed the smash-and-grab PLA intrusions of the past and created a
much more dangerous environment globally when considering intrusions like the recent
Microsoft Exchange Server/HAFNIUM exploitation, which opened attack surfaces to a more
public audience.
This is not to discount the capabilities of the PLA’s newer Strategic Support Force (SSF), which
have likely recently improved by integrating both computer network exploitation (CNE)
capabilities for espionage, and computer network attack (CNA) capabilities which can prepare
potential targets for follow-on destructive attacks in a wartime scenario. However, there has
been a marked increase in cyber espionage activity conducted by the MSS and its contractors
over the past several years, suggesting its model is more favorable for conducting cyber
espionage. To better understand the nuanced reasons for this change, one must examine the
early origins of cyber espionage in China.

The Turning Point for Cyber Espionage in China
Though the PRC’s electronic warfare (EW) capabilities date back well before 2000, the early
2000s saw a dramatic shift in the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) view of Computer Network
Operations (CNO) and its usefulness as a way to bridge key technology gaps and rapidly gain
parity with advanced adversaries like the U.S. in a variety of dual-use technologies (military and
private sector) outlined in the CCP’s overlapping strategic plans that would otherwise be
unattainable without years of research and billions spent on development. The notion that CNO
could be used not just as a warfighting capability, but as a modernized extension of its longrunning economic espionage campaigns would fundamentally change the PRC’s intelligence
collection methods over the next two decades.
This shift toward viewing CNO and “hacking” as a key component of intelligence collection was
likely caused by an intersection of three major factors during the same time frame:
1. Throughout the late 1990’s, PLA doctrine began emphasizing information-centric
strategies to help the PRC win future “informatized” wars and developing asymmetric
capabilities to disrupt more technologically advanced opponents.
2. From 1997-2001, a new subset of young, patriotic, and technologically savvy Chinese
citizens began coalescing in underground hacking communities and using international
site defacements as an outlet for perceived injustices against China by foreign nations.
3. From 1998-2003 CCP officials from the PRC’s various security apparatuses began
experimenting with directed censorship of information on the internet as a way to
influence national sentiment in projects that would become the Golden Shield Project
and the Great Firewall (GFW).

Within several short years, the CCP recognized that the internet posed a massive threat to the
CCP’s internal stability, but that if information and the talented youth using the internet for
nationalistic purposes could be directed properly it would be a massive boon to establishing
control over its populace while advancing China’s strategic economic goals.
Dating back to 2003’s Titan Rain (a cover term for a series of Chinese intrusions into US and
UK government systems), the PLA’s former 3rd Department (3PLA) appears to be the earliest
and most ardent adopter of CNO for espionage purposes. However, over time the MSS’s
superior tradecraft, recruiting practices, and important role in China’s thriving vulnerability
ecosystem would make it the chief threat to a variety of global victims across multiple sectors.
Its ascension post-2015 as the PRC’s lead entity for economic espionage is likely no
coincidence as the PLA began undergoing long-planned reforms which would transform its
cyber warfare capabilities, which have been discussed in other panels today.

Background on the MSS
Creation and Authority
The MSS was created in 1983 by combining the remnants of the CCP’s Investigation
Department with the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) components of intelligence and
counterintelligence to form a ministry that more wholly focused on gathering foreign intelligence.
The fact that it was partially formed from the MPS and its first minister was a former vice
minister of the MPS meant that the MSS initially had a hard time finding its identity, often having
to compete with the MPS for both separate operational and policy space within the higher
echelons of CCP decision-making bodies.
However, the MSS’s close ties to the MPS would become increasingly beneficial in the early
2000s, affording both convenient cover for MSS offices, which were often co-located with MPS
offices (see Figure 1), as well as providing key insight into both the PRC’s censorship
apparatuses (GFW) and software review processes. The latter would later allow the MSS’s
Chinese National Vulnerability Database (CNNVD) to have early access to key vulnerabilities
that now make up the exploits used in cyber operations today.
The MSS was believed to have strengthened its position regarding foreign policy decisionmaking and intelligence under former MSS Minister Geng Huichang (耿惠昌) during the run-up
to the 2008 Beijing Olympics and after handling riots in Tibet and Xinjiang, which followed
shortly after the games. 1 The Ministry saw a budget increase and an expansion of capabilities,
1

“New Foreign Policy Actors in China”, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, September 2010,
http://books.sipri.org/files/PP/SIPRIPP26.pdf

which likely included cyber divisions as beneficiaries, as evidenced by a sharp increase of cyber
campaigns directed against dissidents and other “Five Poisons”. 2
However, a series of defections, perceived intelligence failures, and several high level officials
removed over graft during Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption campaigns in 2012 provided institutional
setbacks to its ambitions. Geng (now the Deputy Director of the Subcommittee for Hong Kong,
Macao, Taiwan and Overseas Chinese) was believed to have been spared by Xi due to his role
in uncovering deposed Politburo member Zhou Yongkang’s planned military coup to oppose
Xi’s appointment as General Secretary. Geng’s replacement in 2015, Chen Wenqing (陈文清),
served in both the MPS and MSS before becoming the deputy director of the Central
Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), the watchdog responsible for many of the
inspections and arrests that took down previous MSS officials. Chen’s prior career and
subsequent appointment as MSS Minister likely represented renewed trust in the MSS by Xi
who had already stacked loyalists into key positions among the CCP’s highest echelons. Chen
is also believed to have taken the helm right as the PLA began its reforms and its cyber
espionage portfolio was likely handed over to the MSS, giving him tremendous control over the
rise in cyber intrusions into western systems carried out by the MSS and its contractors.
The MSS derives its authority from the CCP’s State Council (see Figure 2) and compounding
legislation in 2014, 2015, and 2017, including China’s National Intelligence Law (国家情报法)
made clear requirements that all Chinese citizens and companies (operating in China or
Chinese companies abroad) must collaborate with the MSS in gathering intelligence. In addition,
all Chinese government departments are required to support its intelligence operations when
asked. This provides the MSS with the ability to leverage universities, think tanks, foreign affairs
departments, government sponsored overseas educational programs, military liaison programs,
friendship and student associations, etc. for operational cover as well as to use them as
recruitment platforms. This policy also provides the MSS access to many foreign government
officials, scientists, academics, and students. 3,4
For further reading on the MSS’s history and key personalities I highly recommend “Chinese
Communist Espionage: An Intelligence Primer” by Peter Mattis and Matt Brazil. For further
reading on China’s whole-of-society approach to espionage and examples of specific espionage
cases I recommend “Chinese Espionage: Operations and Tactics” by Nicholas Eftimiades.

How the MSS Sources Technical Capabilities
Like the PLA, which sourced much of its early intrusion capabilities from its burgeoning, techsavvy patriotic hacker cadres, the MSS is not thought to have had well-developed in-house

National People’s Congress on June 27, 2017.

cyber capabilities in the early 2000s, and sought to recruit from outside sources. The PLA
coordinated with SOEs like the China Electronics Technology Group (CETC) and its multitude of
subsidiaries (Westone, for example 5) to throw capture-the-flag competitions at top Chinese
universities to recruit hacking talent early on, and by all accounts was relatively successful in
this approach (see Tan Dailin in the sections below). An exact timeline on the MSS recruitment
of its cyber talent is much harder to pinpoint, but likely began around the same time as the
PLA’s due to a growing interest in developing its own technical capabilities.
The MSS’s true secret weapon turned out to be it’s Technical Bureau/13th Bureau, which
formed the China Information Technical Security Evaluation Center (CNITSEC/中国信息安全测评
中心) in 1998. While ostensibly acting as the government arm entrusted with software and code
review, the intelligence agency was able to capitalize and use its access to interface with nearly
every single domestic cybersecurity company pursuing government contracts and know firsthand which Chinese technical researchers were discovering top-tier vulnerabilities that could be
used in cyber intrusion operations (see Figure 3). If not already familiar with them via CNITSEC,
the MSS would come to work closely with many of the Chinese cybersecurity companies that
had begun to snap up the early generations of patriotic hackers during the 2008 Beijing
Olympics. This included:
●

NSFOCUS - the commercial branch of The Green Army, the original Chinese hacking
collective

●

Topsec - recruited Honker Union of China founder Lin Yong (林勇/Lion)

●

Venustech - hired a significant amount of former Xfocus and 0x557 members

●

Qihoo 360 - employed legacy figures Yuan Renguang (袁仁广/yuange) and Pan
Jianfeng (潘剑锋/pjf)

In addition to having access to a pipeline of China’s early hacking talent, CNITSEC’s true value
would come from providing the MSS with an easy way to cherry-pick high value vulnerabilities
directly from the source, which could be turned into exploits for cyber espionage campaigns.
CNITSEC was likely doing this as early as 2003 when it was given Microsoft’s source code as
part of a security agreement between Microsoft and the Chinese government for usage on its
networks. 6 This was then renewed again in 2010 with Wu Shizhong (吴世忠) as CNITSEC’s
director, who was also dual-hatted as the MSS 13th Bureau Director according to state
documents from 2009-2013. 7,8 CNITSEC is also in charge of reviewing software for government

use, in compliance with the national Cybersecurity Law. In June 2017, Wang Jun, chief engineer
of CNITSEC discussed the Microsoft-CETC joint venture and the need for suspension of
Chinese government use of Windows 10 Chinese Government Edition until it is “secure and
controllable”. 9
Open source analysis in 2017 revealed that CNITSEC and the subordinate CNNVD were likely
purposely delaying reporting on specific vulnerabilities allowing operational windows for their
usage in cyber operations. 10 Just a short time later, in confirmation, KRYPTONITE
PANDA/APT40, a known contractor for MSS Hainan 11 was found to have used high-value
vulnerability CVE-2018-0802 as a 0day exploit, a month before it was publicly reported as being
discovered by Chinese firm Qihoo 360. 12
Legitimate security companies are known to receive advance notice of vulnerabilities from
Western firms such as Microsoft’s Active Protection Partners (MAPP) program, whereby the
firms are notified up to a week in advance of upcoming security updates. Several Chinese firms
privy to these agreements are believed to have actively abused them in the past, knowing that
the initial update merely patches the simple proof-of-concept exploit, leaving a window of
opportunity often lasting several weeks for alternative exploitation methods while the vendor
continues to roll out security updates to address all vectors.
It is suspected that abuse of this system may have led to a rapid proliferation of proof-ofconcept code first turned into an exploit by the HAFNIUM group in January 2021 during the
widespread Microsoft Exchange Server intrusions. The original HAFNIUM group was quickly
joined by multiple APTs that had access to the exploit, with some likely having access prior to
Microsoft’s patch release. This hints at an internal domestic vulnerability sharing network as the
groups with access included both those with suspected ties to the MSS as well as PLA:

MSS operators are also known to source tools and datasets from underground marketplaces.
This has previously included purchasing both datasets that could be used for further intrusion
operations or potential human intelligence (HUMINT) operations, as well as malware sales from
known cyber criminal vendors. This may account for the variety of tools seen in use by MSS

operators and explain why many of them are more advanced than tools typically seen in the
domestic Chinese underground marketplaces.
In an example of typical MSS operations, an intrusion into a European target saw MSS officers
pay contractors to conduct network exploitation on victim systems. Though the origin of the
contractors was unknown, they used tools associated with the Russian underground,
conducting lateral movement across the victim systems before turning direct intrusion access
over to MSS officers. The objectives of the MSS were unclear in this case, however, the access
would allow for easy exfiltration or potential future strategic web compromise activity.

MSS & PLA: Competition vs. Collaboration
Prior evidence suggested that MSS and PLA operations were somewhat in competition for
resources as well as for valuable collection on identified targets. Previously, it was believed
there was a lack of coordination between APT operations groups and there are plenty of
examples in private sector reporting of multiple China-backed adversaries concurrently
collecting the same information on the same network with different operators and tooling.
However, it is likely this coordination is improving with time and greater control of the PLASSF’s
cyber actions due to the reorganization.
There have also been observed instances of the MSS stealing potential recruits from the former
3PLA. A candidate who had already been approached by PLA recruiters was enticed to the
MSS due to an easier recruitment process, better pay/benefits, and more freedom as non
enlisted, which typically meant physical training (PT) for cyber operators unused to it and living
in military dorms. MSS recruitment strategies will be discussed further in the next section.
It appears unlikely in the current environment that MSS cyber operations would be used to prep
the battlefield for PLA network attacks in a wartime footing. This is largely due to the MSS’s role
as primary foreign intelligence collector, a role it would likely default to during wartime
scenarios, and its use of criminal contractors, which are relatively uneven in their capabilities
and methods for conducting CNE. A more likely scenario is that the MSS’s various network
access via their contractors would be handed over to the PLASSF’s CNA units for follow on
actions based on MSS recommendations about target value. This would essentially be handing
its malware controllers over to the military to centralize its possible attack surfaces. As the
PLASSF combines the former 3PLA’s SIGINT capabilities and the 4PLA’s EW methods, it is
likely already conducting intelligence vs. attack value analysis internally to inform its cyber units
on whether a target should be collected on or maintain a foothold on its network for future CNA
use.
The PLASSF’s 311 Base has inherited multiple separate units' prior roles in conducting
psychological warfare operations, making it unlikely the MSS would conduct cyber operations
for this purpose. However, another likely scenario is that the MSS instructs its various
contractors to engage in patriotic hacking of lower tier targets to avoid conflicting with military

operations and to cause chaos and confusion. This would be likely a fairly simple task given the
history of many of its contractors and their patriotic roots.

Recruitment
Contractors act as both a force multiplier and alternative tradecraft for the MSS. Although open
source tools provide the bare essentials needed to meet their collection requirements,
contractors greatly augment their technical capabilities and plausible deniability. The MSS
appears to extensively favor the use of contractors because it allows for operations to be easily
terminated, adds an extra layer of operational security (OPSEC) between the victim and
intelligence officers, offers a variety of technical responses to fulfill collection requirements,
creates plausible deniability in the event attacks are reversed, and can provide additional
technical expertise that may not exist in-house.
Contractors are approached in a variety of ways, sometimes maintaining distance and providing
only direction and requirements. Other times partnerships may be formalized via CNITSEC and
government contracts. It is assessed that during the Beijing 2008 Olympics, the MSS hired
several contractors under the pretext of conducting security evaluations and pentesting. These
hackers-for-hire were based regionally and were told to use any means necessary to
compromise targets. It is unclear whether any of these contractors were then kept on retainer
for future operations after the relationship was established. However, the MSS has since been
observed continuing the use of contractors in multiple operations, making it more likely that
established agreeable working relationships with specific contractors were formed and those
contractors were solicited multiple times.
Recruitment also appears heavily sourced from long-standing patriotic hackers and in many
cases blackhat cyber criminals hacking domestically for profit. New laws during the late 2000s
gave new powers to the MPS and MSS to pursue cyber criminals domestically, and it is
believed that many of these same individuals came under legal scrutiny or were arrested. It is
suspected several were released in exchange for rendering their skills to the state for cyber
espionage purposes, and subsequently allowed to continue their criminal activities as long as
they targeted victims outside China. See the “Evolution” section below for an example of this.
Various domestic Chinese hacking conferences from 2008 onward demonstrated that there
seemed to be an almost revolving door between China’s early patriotic hacker groups, the PLA,
MSS affiliated entities like CNITSEC, and various private sector companies later proven to have
worked for China’s intelligence services. Security conferences like XPwn2017, a Beijing
conference sponsored by Baidu and legacy patriotic hacking team Xfocus, partnered with
CNNVD, Venustech, Alibaba, Pangu Team (China’s top iOS jailbreaking team), and Knownsec
(another security company founded by legacy Chinese hackers). 13 Its main consultants featured
(see Figure 4):

Conferences like XPwn and Tianfu Cup are known fertile recruitment grounds for the MSS and
even the PLA as it provides ample opportunity to meet with established hacking teams, skilled
individual operators, and university students. There will be a separate panel following this one
that discusses some of the universities the MSS and PLA use as recruiting grounds.
Contractors are likely provided ample financial compensation for their efforts, though China
likely struggles from the same private sector “brain drain” effect given China’s top tech firms
have significantly higher salaries and freedom. However, the MSS has an advantage of being
able to co-opt talent if they wish, especially if an individual’s cyber activities conducted during
their youth fall under criminal activity.
Prior to 2017, skilled vulnerability researchers at BAT and Qihoo 360 were able to double up on
prize money by reporting it domestically and then winning competitions like Pwn2Own abroad to
receive prize money from western security vendors. While Chinese dominance in these
competitions was notable to western researchers, it still provided top security vendors with
access into the kinds of vulnerabilities China was producing. The post-2017 arrangement
damages this process and gives even more vulnerability hoarding power to the MSS. As a
result, the MSS and specifically CNITSEC likely needed to increase their prices as part of the
2017 restriction on Chinese vulnerability researchers reporting to foreign vendors before
reporting to the MSS. In addition, it is believed that many of these security researchers or MSS
contractors were barred from leaving China after 2017 and the arrest of the Sakula developer
following his attendance at a US security conference.
It is unclear the exact type of “immunity” contractors that also hack for profit are given if they
conduct operations on behalf of the MSS. Immunity is a loaded term in China, where senior t
retired CCP officials once thought immune to purges were made low again under Xi Jinping’s
rule to prevent outsized influence over current politics. Immunity in this case is much more likely
to represent the MSS and MPS turning a blind eye to these criminal activities rather than
providing lifelong immunity. This makes the relationship between blackhat contractors and the
MSS a tenuous one, based mostly on those criminals conducting their activities outside of China
to prevent a conflict of interest where the MSS and MPS need to protect Chinese citizens from
their own operators. This is likely why there is a rise of tactics like ransomware and cryptojacking against foreign targets from several Chinese actors.

Collection Priorities for PRC Intelligence & Subsequent Tasking
There are numerous fantastic resources that are publicly available and show how China’s
multitude of concurrent plans including the 863 & 973 Plans, Five Year Plans, Made in China
2025 (MIC2025), Space Science & Technology in China: A Roadmap to 2050, and more, which
all create an overlapping tapestry of key technology gaps. Some of the highlights of China’s
priorities from recent plans include:
●
●
●
●

●

Alternative Energy - Solar, Wind Turbines, Hybrid/electric cars
Biotechnology - Biomanufacturing, Biopharmaceuticals, Genetically modified
organisms, Infectious disease treatment, Cutting-edge vaccines and drugs
Defense - Aerospace & Aeronautical Systems, Armaments, Marine Systems, Radar,
Optics, Space infrastructure and exploration technology
High-end Manufacturing - Chemical Manufacturing, Advanced robotics, Aircraft
engines, High-performance composite materials, Integrated circuit manufacturing
equipment and assembly technology
Technology - Artificial intelligence, Big data analysis, High-end computer chips,
Network equipment, Quantum computing and communications, Rare-earth materials

These technology gaps ultimately get broken down into more specific intelligence requirements
that the PRC’s intelligence agencies are then tasked with collecting. For collection, the MSS and
PLA likely share common parent in the form of the State Administration of Science, Technology
and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND/国家国防科技工业局). See Figure 2 for an
organizational chart. Within SASTIND there are likely two departments responsible for
developing and tasking technology related intelligence requirements, and for collecting
intelligence against those requirements. 14
●
●

The Comprehensive Planning Department, which tasks collection to the MSS and most
likely, the PLA, Joint Intelligence Bureau.
The International Cooperation Department, which has its own independent collection
capability. Members of this department travel with PRC scientists to collect information
against specific requirements.

After tasking from SASTIND, it is unclear how the MSS or PLA divvy up requirements or
whether they compete on objectives (competition between the two has thus far only been
observed publicly on an operational basis).
One key factor sets PRC intelligence gathering apart, which is that it takes a whole-of-society
approach to collection. Prior anecdotes about “grains of sand” aside, the MSS is able to
14

Chinese Espionage: Operations and Tactics”, Nicholas Eftimiades, Virtruvian Press, 2020

influence Chinese companies, overseas students, professors, scientists, and the overseas
Chinese diaspora to assist in intelligence gathering efforts, and has been shown to leverage all
of them as both cover and collection agent. The PRC’s National Security Law compels
assistance when required, and the MSS, like its domestic partner the MPS, has been known to
pressure family members residing in China to force actions of those abroad.
This is a force multiplier when combining the MSS’s ability to conduct human intelligence
(HUMINT) and cyber operations in concert. That ability will be discussed in the “HUMINT +
Cyber” section.

Evolution: Chinese Patriotic Hacker → PLA → MSS → Private
This early evolution of how the PRC leveraged its early patriotic hacking groups to supplement
its lack of in-house talent is best viewed through the lens of one individual who has been
present throughout this entire process: Tan Dailin (谭戴林) aka WickedRose. A September 2020
US DoJ indictment against several members of the WICKED PANDA/APT41 featured Tan and
several co-conspirators who had conducted over 100 documented intrusions into global
companies over the course of a decade. 15 My own research around this indictment and actor
led me to discover the untold story of how Tan evolved from an angsty patriotic hacker at
university, to the leader of a group of contract hackers for hire for the PLA, an MSS contractor,
and eventually a savvy cybersecurity entrepreneur (see Figure 5).
Tan was a central figure in the early 2000s Chengdu patriotic hacking scene and a notable
member of the Evil Octal Security Team. While attending Sichuan-area universities, he formed
ties with Zhou Jibing (赵纪斌) aka WHG, the developer of PlugX 16, a remote access tool (RAT)
that would later be favored by a majority of Chinese APT groups from 2012-2016 17. Tan’s skills
as a developer and intrusion operator led to him founding the Network Crack Program Hacker
(NCPH) group out of his dorm room while at the Sichuan Institute of Science and
Engineering/Sichuan University of Science and Technology (SCIT/四川理工学院). Tan and Zhao
worked to develop the NCPH rootkit, which was also known as GinWui. The variant GinWui.A is
believed to have been an early precursor to PlugX, which was later licensed out to multiple APT
groups for use in offensive campaigns against western systems. This suggests both a common
supply chain entity providing these tools across PLA and MSS lines, and that Zhao was likely
paid to continue to develop and refine his malicious code into first PlugX and later the evolved
Clambling RAT over several years and cycles of development.

Tan applied to graduate school at Sichuan University in 2005. It was during his time there that
Tan is believed to have been approached by the PLA, which found him via his blog and his
attempted intrusions into Japanese systems. In September 2005, he was encouraged to
participate in a Network Attack/Defense Competition where he and his team won first place. 18
Tan was found by the Chengdu Military Militia Information Sub-Unit—a unit that likely served as
recruitment spotters for the former 3PLA Chengdu Military Region (MR) 1st Technical
Reconnaissance Bureau (TRB) Unit 78006, which was later implicated in the Titan Rain attacks
against the U.S. government. 19
Following the competition in October 2005, Tan and his team of former NCPH colleagues
participated in an intensive 16-hour-a-day, month-long training period with the PLA designed to
simulate attacks, design hacking tools, and develop training courses for network infiltration
strategies. It is assessed that these efforts greatly improved PLA cyber operations at the time.
In the spring of 2006, Tan continued to refine the Ginwui rootkit before dropping out of school on
30 April 2006 to pursue state-directed intrusion operations full time. From May through
September 2006, Tan and the NCPH crew likely conducted CNE operations directed against the
U.S. DOD on behalf of the PLA. The intrusions at the time were unprecedented and are some of
the first examples of the PLA (and by extension the CCP) paying the salaries of hackers for hire
to conduct CNE against the U.S. 20
From the timing of Tan’s blog posts during these intrusions, it is clear the PLA provided lodging
and salaries to several young Chinese hackers as part of this campaign. Included among those
mentioned as “colleagues” on Tan’s posts was Blackfox, the alias of fellow indicted WICKED
PANDA member Jiang Lizhi (see Figure 6). 21 In 2007, Jiang would go on to work for offensive
cyber PLA contractor Yanlong Tech, a technology firm regularly targeting the gaming industry—
which is assessed to be activity roughly analogous to early Winnti Group operations against
multiple Asian and western gaming firms. It is unclear whether Tan and Jiang had met prior to
this hacking “internship” with the PLA, but it is likely this served as a common thread for their
future endeavors together as well as the reason Yanlong did early work for the Chengdu MR
TRB. Tan would join Yanlong reportedly only in 2011, but Jiang stayed until 2014 when he left
to start Chengdu 404, the other contracting entity outlined in the 2020 DoJ indictment.
Details from Tan’s personal blog show that he also disliked his time at Sichuan University and
was merely there to get his degree, much preferring his “internship” colleagues and time spent
hacking. Tan’s own former university in Zigong listed him among accomplished students for
winning first place in the first national computer network offensive/defensive competition and
earning the “first-class merit award” from the PLA Chengdu MR. Other records show he
competed in the Chengdu Westone Cup and took second place in 2006. Westone is a

subsidiary of the China Electronics Technology Group Corporation’s (CETC) Network
Information Security Company and of the CETC 30th Research Institute in Sichuan. CETC is a
known state-owned enterprise (SOE) and benefactor and potential driver of Chinese CNE and
intellectual property theft; the organization has conducted classified work on behalf of the PLA
and MSS.
In April 2009, several Chinese forums reported that Tan was arrested by the Ministry of Public
Security (MPS) after he reportedly conducted Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and
blackmailed users of other popular hacking forums such as Hackbase, the magazine
HackerXFiles, and 3800hk. Members of these groups are believed to have turned him into the
authorities. He faced 7.5 years in jail, however it is unclear whether he actually served any of
the time. 22
Given the DoJ indictment information that he contracted for the MSS more recently, one
potential theory is that due to his prior military contracting service, the MSS made him a plea
deal to continue hack-for-hire intrusion activity in exchange for commuting his sentence. Tan is
suspected to have reappeared in 2011 when he worked for Yanlong Tech using the alias
Blackwolf, reuniting with his former associates Blackfox and EvilC0de. The firm appeared to
have strong ties to the gaming community and due to prior five year plans outlining the CCP’s
desire to become a major global force, it is believed many of the team members used their
experience working with kernel-level vulnerabilities modding games to conduct intrusion
operations and target Asian and western gaming firms to steal technology and monetize ingame currency.
It is unclear why Tan left after barely a year at Yanlong, but he wasted no time getting back to
his criminal roots by setting up a fake antivirus firm named Anvisoft. 23 Although the firm
purported to offer a security product, given Tan’s concurrent activities, it is likely this was a front
company for other activities and that Tan began contracting for the MSS around this time.
Tan’s activities after 2012 are less readily accessible despite his fame. This is potentially due to
his online presence being scrubbed by the MSS. Registrant data for emails tied to Tan suggest
he was still active as a MSS contractor and consistently registering domains from 2012 to
2019—though none that were immediately traceable to WICKED PANDA/APT41 activity. This is
potentially indicative of him using third parties for domain registration given his own notoriety by
that point.
Legal records show that from a period from June 2010 to at least April 2020, Tan was busy
registering several private technology firms with various focuses, serving as a legal
representative, technology director, investor, and CEO at several firms. Tan was still in
Chengdu during this period as evidenced by both the firms he registered and also the
technology patents filed under his name.

https://krebsonsecurity.com/2012/11/infamous-hacker-heading-chinese-antivirus-firm/#comments

Tan’s path follows many famous legacy Chinese hackers who served as contractors or
educators for various state-backed entities in the late 2000s before becoming entrepreneurs in
China’s burgeoning cybersecurity scene throughout the 2010s. As demonstrated in countless
other companies claiming to do only whitehat security work on behalf of the Chinese state,
many of the upper echelon of China’s cybersecurity companies have close ties to the CCP and
conduct offensive operations as well as providing defense. Some of these firms, such as
Threatbook and Qihoo 360, have established themselves as defensive cybersecurity
organizations, but they likely also engage in offensive intrusion activities and/or vulnerability
research on behalf of the CCP. Former Qihoo 360 executive Tan Xiaosheng (谭晓生) served as
a director at one of Tan’s own firms and has been previously implicated along with Qihoo for his
ties to the MSS 13th Bureau/CNITSEC.
Also of note in these indictments against WICKED PANDA/APT41 was their collection of data
during their intrusion campaigns which fed into a big data repository tool Tan’s co-conspirators
called SonarX. These actors were particularly skilled at extracting personally identifiable
information (PII) during their intrusions and finding a way to monetize it via this platform.
Furthermore, the case showed that not only are breaches like these collecting the data, but that
the data sets are being organized and used for follow-on targeting of dissidents, journalists, and
religious figures. This proves the MSS is likely capable of using data gleaned from other
breaches such as 2015’s OPM breach to create targeting packages for both future cyber and
HUMINT operations.

MSS Use of HUMINT and Cyber Operations in Tandem
Another recent DoJ/FBI case that brilliantly shows how the MSS operates is a series of
indictments tied to a set of cyber operators named TURBINE PANDA/APT26. This actor and its
campaigns stand out for several reasons:
●
●
●
●

●

The case resulted in the first US arrest and extradition (in partnership with EU-based
authorities and allies) of a high-ranking MSS intelligence officer.
It demonstrated the MSS’s ability to use HUMINT operations and insider threats in
tandem with cyber espionage campaigns to great effect (See Figure 7)
MSS’s HUMINT and cyber operators frequently communicated and even attempted to
cover one another’s tracks, demonstrating a high degree of coordination.
MSS cyber operators were likely made up of a mixture of in-house talent and outside
contractors, many of which have traceable backgrounds to various Chinese patriotic
hacking groups.
TURBINE PANDA’s multi-year cyber campaign systematically targeted various
aerospace firms that made up the supply chain for foreign-sourced parts for China’s
C919 airliner.

●

●
●

●

TURBINE PANDA operators also played a role in conducting the OPM intrusion, likely
as part of the MSS’s big data collection efforts to map US cleared government
employees.
The timescale for these operations happened in quick succession; Chinese aerospace
firms had barely inked joint ventures with western firms before operational prep began.
The totality of identifying key technology gaps, cyber campaigns, HUMINT operations,
malware development/usage, and eventual arrests offered a rare glimpse into the full
Chinese intelligence cycle from tasking to collection, analysis, and eventually a statebacked beneficiary.
The aftermath showed an immediate reaction from the MSS from 2017 onward, which
banned many security researchers from traveling to overseas conferences and codified
CNITSEC’s ability to harvest domestic vulnerability research for use in exploits. If
anything this likely increased the potency of MSS cyber capabilities.

A major focus of the CCP in the late 2000s was a Chinese-built commercial aircraft designed to
compete with the duopoly of western aerospace and keep pace with China’s exponentially
growing middle class and their travel needs. That aircraft would become the C919—an aircraft
roughly half the cost of its competitors, and which completed its first maiden flight in 2017 after
years of delays due to design flaws. But the C919 can hardly be seen as a complete domestic
triumph as it is reliant on a plethora of foreign-manufactured components (see Figure 8 for an
incomplete list). Likely in an effort to bridge those gaps, TURBINE PANDA conducted cyber
intrusions from a period of roughly 2010 to 2015 against a variety of companies that make up
the C919’s supply chain.
Specifically, in December 2009, the state-owned enterprise (SOE) Commercial Aircraft
Corporation of China (COMAC/中国商用飞机有限责任公司) announced it had chosen CFM
International’s (a joint venture between U.S.-based GE Aviation and French aerospace firm
Safran, formerly Snecma) LEAP-X engine to provide a custom variant engine, the LEAP-1C, for
the then-newly announced C919. The deal was reportedly signed in Beijing during a visit by
then-French Prime Minister François Fillon.
Despite the early deal with CFM, both COMAC and fellow SOE the Aviation Industry
Corporation of China (AVIC/中国 航空工业集团公司) were believed to be tasked by China’s
State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC)
with building an “indigenously created” turbofan engine that was comparable to the LEAP-X. In
August 2016, both COMAC and AVIC became the main shareholders of the Aero Engine
Corporation of China (AECC/中国航空发动机集团), which produced the CJ-1000AX engine. The
CJ-1000AX bears multiple similarities to the LEAP-1C, including its dimensions and turbofan
blades.
The AECC conducted its first test in May 2018, having overcome significant difficulties in their
first mockups. Though it is difficult to assess that the CJ-1000AX is a direct copy of the LEAP-X
without direct access to technical engineering specifications, it is highly likely that its makers

benefited significantly from the cyber espionage efforts of the MSS, knocking several years (and
potentially billions of dollars) off of its development time.
From August 2017 until October 2018, the DoJ released several separate, but related
indictments against Sakula developer Yu Pingan 24, JSSD Intelligence Officer Xu Yanjun 25, GE
Employee and insider Zheng Xiaoqing 26, U.S. Army Reservist and assessor Ji Chaoqun 27, and
10 JSSD-affiliated cyber operators in the Zhang et. al. indictment 28. What makes these DoJ
cases so fascinating is that, when looked at as a whole, they illustrate the broad, but
coordinated efforts the Jiangsu State Security Department (JSSD) in Nanjing took to collect
information from its aerospace targets. In particular, the operations connected to a TURBINE
PANDA showed both traditional human-intelligence (HUMINT) operators and its cyber operators
working in parallel to pilfer the secrets of several international aerospace firms and even the
data from OPM.
It is believed that cyber targeting of aerospace firms by TURBINE PANDA cyber operators
began in January 2010, almost immediately after the LEAP-X engine was chosen for the C919.
The Zhang indictment describes initial preparatory action using doppelganger sites to conduct
strategic web compromises (SWC) in combination with DNS hijacking to compromise various
aerospace firms using two China-based APT favorite pieces of malware, PlugX and Winnti, and
malware assessed to be unique to the group dubbed Sakula.
The same ZHANG indictment indicates that these operations were overseen by CHAI Meng (柴
萌), who likely managed the JSSD’s cyber operators as a pseudo Cyber Section Chief.
Reporting to CHAI was the cyber operator team lead, LIU Chunliang (刘春亮
/sxpdlc1r/Fangshou), who appeared to establish and maintain much of the infrastructure used in
the attacks on various aerospace targets as well as organize the intrusions conducted by the
operators Zhang Zhanggui (张长贵/Ieanovr/Ieaonr), Gao Hongkun (高洪 坤/Mer4en7y), Zhuang
Xiaowei (庄枭伟/jpxxav), Ma Zhiqi (马志琪/Le Ma), and Li Xiao (李潇/zhuan86). Many of these
individuals are assessed to have storied histories in legacy underground hacking circles within
China dating back to at least 2004. Notably, Liu also appeared to broker the use of Sakula from
its developer Yu, as well as the malware IsSpace (associated with SAMURAI PANDA) from its
developer Zhuang. Liu and Yu’s conversations about Sakula would be a critical factor in tying all
of this disparate activity together as Sakula was believed to be unique to the JSSD operators
and could be used to tie several aerospace intrusion operations into a single, long-running
campaign as well as the OPM intrusions.

Simultaneously, there was a HUMINT element to the JSSD’s espionage operations against
aerospace targets. Xu Yanjun, was identified in his indictment as the Deputy Division Director of
the Sixth Bureau of the JSSD in charge of Insider Threats. Xu affiliated himself with two cover
organizations—Jiangsu Science and Technology Association (JAST) and the Nanjing Science &
Technology Association (NAST)— when interacting with potential targets. Xu also was reported
as frequently associating with the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronomics (NUAA), a
significant national defense university controlled by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information
Technology (MIIT), that interfaces directly with many of China’s top defense firms and stateowned enterprises. It is likely no coincidence that NUAA is a regular collaborator with stateowned enterprises (SOEs) COMAC and AVIC, the main shareholders of AECC, which went on
to produce the LEAP-X inspired CJ1000-AX turbine engine for the C919.
Over the course of several years, Xu would recruit both an insider at LEAP-X manufacturer
General Electric (GE), Zheng Xiaoqing, and a Chinese-born Army reservist, Ji Chaoqun (季超
群). Zheng’s background appears to have made him uniquely qualified to accurately assess
turbine engine schematics, and it was clear from his indictment that he had received coaching
on which sensitive information on GE’s turbine technology to access and how to use
steganography in an attempt to exfiltrate the information. Ji, who entered the U.S. on an F-1
student visa to study electrical engineering in Chicago, was approached by Xu (initially
undercover as an NUAA professor) in December 2013 and eventually recruited to provide
assessments on other high-value individuals in the aerospace industry for potential recruitment
by the MSS. Ji’s position in the U.S. Army Reserve program known as Military Accessions Vital
to the National Interest (MAVNI) provided a perfect cover for Ji’s assessment activities, as the
program focuses on potential recruitment of foreign citizens with skills pertinent to national
interest and legally residing in the U.S. Had it been successful, JI would have been handing Xu
other foreign-born recruitment candidates as they were about to enter U.S. military service on
potentially sensitive projects.

Exposure
As the frequency of MSS operations increased and attention shifted from the PLA during its
reorganization, a mixture of anonymous reporting from a group called IntrusionTruth, private
sector reporting, and DoJ indictments have shed more light on the MSS’s cyber operations.
However, most notably, these repeated exposures do not appear to be actively hindering
continued activity from MSS contractors, which have only gotten more brazen in their recent
activities.
Beginning in May 2017, the first public exposure of MSS-affiliated entities came from an
anonymous group known as IntrusionTruth in the form of blogs and a twitter account dropping
(sometimes dubiously sourced) series of posts detailing personal details of MSS cyber
contractors and the breadcrumbs they’d left behind during their prior intrusion efforts. Over the
course of several years they would out individuals tied to groups known in the private sector as

GOTHIC PANDA/APT3, STONE PANDA/APT10, AURORA PANDA/APT17, KRYPTONITE
PANDA/APT40, and other lesser known entities. These were roughly tied to provincial and
national level MSS bureaus and CNITSEC offices in Guangdong, Tianjin, Jinan, and Hainan
respectively. Though sometimes presented haphazardly in blog posts, multiple private sector
firms' work including CrowdStrike, Mandiant, and RecordedFuture appeared to frequently
corroborate IntrusionTruth’s releases. In addition, several released DoJ indictments followed
these mysterious releases, further corroborating that the US government knows about many of
these actors and their backgrounds.
I will refrain from commenting much further on IntrusionTruth as anonymity is key to their
continued successful operations. The MSS has previously proven it has no issues publicly
executing spies or those assisting foreign powers, and their very existence is likely perceived as
a threat to the CCP. 29 However, I do believe good work is being done here and it is breaking
down some of the existing barriers between private sector cyber intelligence and the federal
sector, which ultimately leads to more future collaboration.
Integral work is currently being done by all the mentioned parties to identify these threats and
prevent them from harming US interests. However, more work is needed to assist these efforts
with funding and new policies centered around collective defense, active defense/offense, and
education of our partners, allies, and our workforces.

Recommendations
The CCP has managed to absorb new technology and strategy the U.S. has pioneered (the
Internet, EW usage in the Gulf War, Cult of the Dead Cow’s use of Trojans, Microsoft’s source
code, destructive cyberweapons, etc.) and turn it into an asymmetric advantage. In a way,
rampant Chinese cyber espionage is a monster of our own creation, but it is one that can at
least be curbed through carefully considered policy adjustments.
One thing is painfully clear: the strategy of “Name & Shame” does not work, and the CCP’s
constantly regurgitated response asking for proof and the US complying is akin to handing
China a report card on their intelligence gathering capabilities. Robust, two-way policies for
sharing of threat actor information across the private and federal sector, as well as between
international intelligence partners can still be incredibly useful. But naming and shaming in
hopes of embarrassing China into changing its behavior is not the effective deterrent or
panacea it was perhaps naively hoped to be under rule of Xi Jinping.
My recommendations, while numerous, look to combat China’s whole-of-society approach to
gathering intelligence with our own multi-faceted active defense approach. It draws upon
29

“Chinese Communist Espionage: An Intelligence Primer”, Introduction, pg. 1, Peter Mattis and Matthew
Brazil, Naval Institute Press 2019

frustrations myself and many other hard-working patriots in both the federal and private sector
have experienced when trying to combat this threat for well over a decade. This involves a
strategy of hardening defenses, providing meaningful consequences that impose costs to APT
groups, and education of our partners and domestic assets.

Harden Defense
●

Invest in better software solutions and data centers to un-silo and share data between
domestic agencies and commercial businesses. Some collaboration is happening
between CISA and information sharing and analysis centers (ISACs), but it is disparate,
usually depends on interpersonal relationships, and data is fragmented from company to
company (i.e. hard to utilize effectively for collective defense). This needs to go beyond
CISA and should involve several government agencies and counterintelligence
stakeholders.

●

Re-examine intelligence classification methods for data sharing purposes. As
demonstrated in several of the aforementioned DoJ cases, much of the data concerning
Chinese intrusions are “overclassified”, which unnecessarily gate keeps relevant parties
and hampers collective defense. Sources and methods should remain classified, but
most cyber tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) are predominantly discoverable
using open source techniques and should be treated as such. Open source centers work
and should be more accessible to the private sector.

●

Increase intelligence sharing on Chinese cyber espionage with allied international
countries to reduce attack surfaces and increase collective defense. The US need not
act as gatekeepers of Chinese counterintelligence when a multitude of nations and
industries suffer from the same affliction. Encourage two-way sharing of Indicators of
Compromise (IOCs) and counterintelligence reports. Improve inter-agency task forces to
share internationally, and educate partners on removing bureaucracy from the multitude
of cyber departments and stakeholders that currently exist. Publicly promote united
stances with partners against China’s cyber espionage activities and more recently
destructive actions (HAFNIUM).

●

Establish defensive partnership programs via government and private sector
cybersecurity firms with Asian allies (Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Philippines, Vietnam)
to hunt, remove Chinese adversaries from their networks, and improve overall defensive
posture. Frankly, this should have already started for increasingly critical technology
companies such as TSMC and other partners in the semiconductor supply chain.

●

Re-shape public and private policies around disclosure of hacks. As both a former FBI
and private sector cybersecurity employee I’ve seen a breakdown between the balance
of commercial firms trying to prevent stocks from plunging by disclosing an intrusion and

counterintelligence efforts getting the timely information they need for national security
purposes. Incentivize reporting of intrusions via trusted commercial cybersecurity
partners or FBI/DHS and establish meaningful consequences for firms that sweep
intrusions under the rug or attempt to cover them up. Reporting should be mandatory for
commercial firms receiving government money, especially defense contracts.
●

More defensive options for federal (FBI, DHS) and approved private sector entities to
remove attack surfaces and take down (and recover copies of) malicious C2
infrastructure. Increased sharing between federal/private stakeholders to include hosting
providers and domain providers. Expand existing sharing relationships to include raw
data in addition to technical indicators of malicious activity.

Active Defense/Offense
●

More offensive options on a sliding scale for federal (DOD/NSA, CIA) entities to impose
cost on known APT groups. Currently, there are no actions happening (or at least
publicly known) that have dissuaded Chinese APTs from engaging in cyber espionage.
The CCP has done cost/benefit analysis and concluded it is currently too beneficial to its
strategic plans to stop these activities or to care about being implicated. In many cases,
these individual actors or firms are well-known to US intelligence agencies; we should
not be as hesitant to let our own professionals covertly degrade their ability to conduct
future operations especially when there is a body of evidence of historical criminal or
destructive actions. Tan Dailin/WickedRose would easily fall into this category as a two
decade repeat offender.

●

Add Chinese universities, companies, and conferences providing support to APTs or a
proven cyber talent pipeline for the MSS/PLA to the US Commerce Department’s Entity
List. Consider revoking visas for professors and students from Chinese universities in
special cyber and technology programs that are known to receive funding/support from
MSS/PLA or have been implicated in prior espionage cases.

●

Conduct economic action to include sanctions against known CNITSEC contractors and
entities actively supporting Chinese cyber espionage, surveillance of minority groups,
and vulnerability miners that fail to report to affected western companies.

●

Deputize and create standards and procedures around private cybersecurity companies’
ability to assist in deception and denial techniques on behalf of their customers. Think
less “letters of marque” and more the model set by the NSA’s Accredited Cyber Incident
Response Services vendors.

●

Draft public policies that protect valuable domestic security researchers from external
attacks by foreign APT groups and make targeting them a punishable offense by law.
Establish meaningful consequences for foreign intelligence services that seek to harm,

intimidate, or disrupt the work of US domestic security researchers. The recent incident
involving an anonymous researcher P4x shutting down North Korea’s internet in
retaliation to personal attacks and a lack of government support comes to mind. 30
•

Work with international law enforcement partners to apprehend and degrade MSS
contractor’s overseas accomplices or seize laundered funds. This hits select entities in
their wallets and makes it more difficult to for them to profit off criminal activity on the
side of their MSS operations.

Educate

30

●

Reform the DoJ’s “China Initiative” to include more educational resources about
MSS/PLA recruitment techniques and the consequences of spying. Students studying
abroad are frequent targets of these efforts, but there are little efforts made to educate
students from abroad on the potential consequences. Solicit input from ChineseAmericans and trained linguists to make educational videos about PRC intelligence
recruitment and pressure techniques, and safe steps to report it to university authorities
and the DoJ. Require US universities to establish safe reporting spaces free of reprisal
or public ridicule, as there are several cases of Chinese students reporting “unpatriotic”
activities to the MSS while abroad, damaging trust in Chinese student associations.
These efforts should take maximum effort to not discriminate against Chinese students
and professors or impede normal educational exchanges.

●

Sponsor “diplomatic track” cyber competitions that promote further sharing between
Chinese and western capture-the-flag/cybersecurity groups to reestablish the hacker
spirit of healthy competition. Anyone who’s attended DEFCON or any less commercial
cybersecurity conference will be able to tell you that for the most talented of cyber
researchers, they attend to share knowledge and bend technology to their will, free of
any patriotic loyalty. Attendees are immune from threat of arrest or prosecution, which
encourages their best to attend these events and contribute to cross-country information
exchanges and dialogue.

●

Coordinate alternate bug bounty programs with western stakeholders (Google,
Microsoft, Apple, Meta) to encourage Chinese researchers to responsibly disclose
vulnerabilities. Allow Chinese-focused payment methods (Alipay, WeChat/Weixin Pay)
with a holding mechanism that pays out only after a designated time period where
patching can take place and CNITSEC’s ability to cherry-pick vulnerabilities can pass.
This encourages more Log4j style disclosures 31 from Chinese tech firms where PRC
intelligence is shut out from utilizing high value 0days.

https://www.wired.com/story/north-korea-hacker-internet-outage/
In 2021, an Alibaba employee first reported the now infamous Log4j vulnerability to Apache, bypassing
CCP government policies of reporting to CNITSEC first. Why the Alibaba researcher did not report the
vulnerability to the government first is unclear, but the company lost a government contract as a result

31

●

Continue to improve, invest in, and boost domestic US cybersecurity talent programs to
fill the shortage of qualified professionals. Allocate funding for hiring qualified private
sector experts as government consultants and improving federal/private partnership
opportunities. Relax drug testing and federal application policies for cyber positions
given the rapidly changing legal landscape for marijuana and psilocybin medical use
across many states in the US. Former FBI Director Robert Mueller advocated this
approach in 2010 anticipating the need to bring on more qualified cyber professionals in
the future, and noting how many excellent applicants were turned away based on
outdated drug policies.
