SamSam: The Doctor Will See You, After He Pays The
Ransom
blog.talosintel.com/2016/03/samsam-ransomware.html

Cisco Talos is currently observing a widespread campaign leveraging the
Samas/Samsam/MSIL.B/C ransomware variant. Unlike most ransomware, SamSam is not
launched via user focused attack vectors, such as phishing campaigns and exploit kits. This
particular family seems to be distributed via compromising servers and using them as a
foothold to move laterally through the network to compromise additional machines which are
then held for ransom. A particular focus appears to have been placed on the healthcare
industry.
Adversaries have been seen leveraging JexBoss, an open source tool for testing and
exploiting JBoss application servers, to gain a foothold in the network. Once they have
access to the network they proceed to encrypt multiple Windows systems using SamSam.

Technical Details
Upon compromising the system the sample will launch a samsam.exe process which begins
the process of encrypting files on the system.

SamSam encrypts various file types (see Appendix A) with Rijndael and then encrypts that
key with RSA-2048 bit encryption. This makes the files unrecoverable unless the author
made a mistake in the implementation of the encryption algorithms. The adversaries behind
this ransomware variant did not go to any length to disguise or cover up the ransomware
activity on the system. The samples Talos obtained are not packed and do not contain antidebugging features.
One interesting note regarding the samples Talos has observed is that the malware will abort
the encryption routine if the system is running a version of Microsoft Windows prior to Vista.
This is likely done for compatibility reasons. Once installed on a machine there is no
beaconing or C2 activity. The ransomware is effectively self sufficient.
Below is an example of the communication between a victim and the adversaries. Notice in
this instance, the victim initially paid for one PC and followed up by paying for all affected
PCs.

Tools
There were a couple of open source tools that were seen being leveraged by the
adversaries. The first is JexBoss, which is a testing and exploitation framework for JBoss
application servers. This was being used as an initial infection vector to gain a foothold in the
network to spread the ransomware. The second is a component of REGeorg, tunnel.jsp.
REGeorg is an open source framework to create socks proxies for communication. The file
found in the samples is an unmodified version of the tunnel.jsp file that is being hosted by
REGeorg (b963b8b8c5ca14c792d2d3c8df31ee058de67108350a66a65e811fd00c9a340c).

Payment Evolution
As we have monitored this activity, we have started to see changes in the amount and types
of payment options available to victims. Initially, we saw a payment option of 1 bitcoin for
each PC that has been infected.

Later we saw the price for a single system has been raised to 1.5 bitcoin. It is likely the
malware author is trying to see how much people will pay for their files. They even added an
option for bulk decryption of 22 bitcoin to decrypt all infected systems. Below is an example
of this evolution.

Others have also seen samples that have increased the payment amount to 1.7 bitcoin per
PC. During our investigation we found multiple different bitcoin wallets being presented to
users, some had 0 bitcoins associated with them others had significant amounts. The total
amount of bitcoin in these wallets was at least ~275 which equates to approximately
$115,000 USD. Below is a screen capture showing some of the obfuscated wallets. They
have been obfuscated so that we can continue to monitor their activity.

Conclusion
The SamSam campaign is unusual in that it is taking advantage of remote execution
techniques instead of targeting the user. Adversaries are exploiting known vulnerabilities in
unpatched JBoss servers before installing a web shell, identifying further network connected
systems, and installing SamSam ransomware to encrypt files on these devices.
Ransomware continues to persist as a successful cyber crime business model. This
technique is proving to be a profitable affair for criminals and will continue to be a threat to
the internet at large until a more profitable technique is discovered. Protection against such
threats is best achieved using a multi-tier defense architecture to ensure potential threats are
scanned multiple times. However, one of the most effective ways to protect yourself is by
simply backing up valuable files. Victims often find that at the moment when backups are
most needed, they are either non-existent or incomplete. These lapses provide the revenue
stream that is currently fueling the development of ransomware.
