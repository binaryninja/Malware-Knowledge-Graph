Ransomware Struck Another Pipeline Firm‚Äîand 70GB of
Data Leaked

When ransomware hackers hit Colonial Pipeline last month and shut off the distribution of
gas along much of the East Coast of the United States, the world woke up to the danger of
digital disruption of the petrochemical pipeline industry. Now it appears another pipelinefocused business was also hit by a ransomware crew around the same time, but kept its
breach quiet‚Äîeven as 70 gigabytes of its internal files were stolen and dumped onto the
dark web.
A group identifying itself as Xing Team last month posted to its dark web site a collection of
files stolen from LineStar Integrity Services, a Houston-based company that sells auditing,
compliance, maintenance, and technology services to pipeline customers. The data, first
spotted online by the WikiLeaks-style transparency group Distributed Denial of Secrets, or
DDoSecrets, includes 73,500 emails, accounting files, contracts, and other business
documents, around 19 GB of software code and data, and 10 GB of human resources files
that includes scans of employee driver's licenses and Social Security cards. And while the
breach doesn't appear to have caused any disruption to infrastructure like the Colonial
Pipeline incident, security researchers warn the spilled data could provide hackers a
roadmap to more pipeline targeting.

DDoSecrets, which makes a practice of trawling data leaked by ransomware groups as part
of its mission to expose data it deems worthy of public scrutiny, published 37 gigabytes of the
company's data to its leak site on Monday. The group says it was careful to redact potentially
sensitive software data and code‚Äîwhich DDoSecrets says could enable follow-on hackers
to find or exploit vulnerabilities in pipeline software‚Äîas well as the leaked human resources
material, in an effort to leave out LineStar employees' sensitive, personally identifiable
information.
But the unredacted files, which WIRED has reviewed, remain online. And they may include
information that could enable follow-on targeting of other pipelines, argues Joe Slowik, a
threat intelligence researcher for security firm Gigamon who has focused on critical
infrastructure security for years as the former head of incident response at Los Alamos
National Labs. While Slowik notes that it's still not clear what sensitive information might be
included in the leak's 70 GB, he worries that it could include information about the software
architecture or physical equipment used by LineStar's customers, given that LineStar
provides information technology and industrial control system software to pipeline customers.
"You can use that to fill in lots of targeting data, depending on what's in there," says Slowik.
"It's very concerning, given the potential that it's not just about people's driver's license
information or other HR related items, but potentially data that relates to the operation of
these networks and their more critical functionality."
Xing Team is a relatively new entrant to the ransomware ecosystem. But while the group
writes its name with a Chinese character on its dark web site‚Äîand comes from the Mandarin
word for ‚Äústar‚Äù‚Äîthere's little reason to believe the group is Chinese based on that name
alone, says Brett Callow, a ransomware-focused researcher with antivirus firm Emsisoft.
Callow says he's seen Xing Team use the rebranded version of Mount Locker malware to
encrypt victims' files, as well as threaten to leak the unencrypted data as a way to extort
targets into paying. In the case of LineStar, Xing Team appears to have followed through on
that threat.
That leak could in turn serve as a stepping stone for other ransomware hackers, who
frequently comb dark web data dumps for information that can be used to impersonate
companies and target their customers. "If you were to steal data from a pipeline company,
that could possibly enable you to construct a fairly conventional spearphishing email to
another pipeline company," says Callow. "We absolutely know that groups do that."
LineStar did not respond to multiple requests for comment prior to publication, but sent an
emailed statement several hours after this story went live. "LineStar is a small, private
company and we were the victim of a ransomware attack in late April that targeted corporate
data. There was no impact to either internal or customer operations," said LineStar CFO
Chris Boston in the statement. "Immediately following the attack, we notified our employees
of a potential breach involving employee personal information, engaged third-party IT experts
and notified the FBI. We have been taking every reasonable measure to protect our
2/4

employees while responding to an internal data breach and subsequent theft." Boston further
claimed that "comparisons made" in this story were "completely inaccurate and provably
untrue," but did not provide any specific objections.
DDoSecrets' practice of republishing the leaked data of ransomware victims‚Äîeven in a
redacted form‚Äîhas been criticized for amplifying ransomware groups' coercive techniques.
But the group's cofounder Emma Best, who uses the pronoun "they," argues that doing so for
the LineStar leak in particular helps to shine a spotlight on an industry with a long record of
environmental scandals. The Colonial Pipeline itself leaked 1.2 million gallons of gasoline
into a nature preserve in North Carolina less than a year prior to being targeted by
ransomware, Best points out. ‚ÄúTo torture a metaphor, fuel is the fuel of our economy, but it's
also a poison when they frequently leak or the pipeline's construction, operation, or
maintenance infringe on communities, typically already marginalized ones,‚Äù Best told WIRED
in a text interview.
Best notes that even the shutdown of the pipeline following Colonial's ransomware incident in
May, which triggered gas shortages across the East Coast, wasn't primarily due to safety
concerns, but business and billing issues. "This isn't an industry that has the public interest
at heart," Best writes. They didn't confirm if they had found any evidence of wrongdoing in
the leaked LineStar files, but argue that it's noteworthy either way. "With some industries, you
have to stop and study them regardless of individual wrongdoing because the industry itself
is either so inherently harmful or fraught with danger that to not study it would be reckless."
The breach of a second pipeline firm by ransomware operators after Colonial's shutdown
may seem to signal a trend of cybercriminal hackers specifically targeting critical
infrastructure. But Emsisoft's Brett Callow points out that ransomware groups like Xing Team
are targeting companies mostly indiscriminately, casting a wide net as they seek to maximize
their ransom payments.
‚ÄúThere has been a lot of talk about critical infrastructure being targeted in this war-like
situation, but that is really bullshit,‚Äù Callow says. ‚ÄúThey are just going after everybody. It's a
feeding frenzy.‚Äù
That hacking epidemic, however, now extends to the industrial backbone of the American
economy. And with the breach of a company that serves as a hub of one such industry, the
stakes are only getting higher.
