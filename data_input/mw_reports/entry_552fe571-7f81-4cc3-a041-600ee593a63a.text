A new version of the Stampado ransomware called Philadelphia has started being sold for
$400 USD by a malware developer named The Rainmaker, According to Rainmaker,
Philadelphia is being sold as a low cost ransomware solution that allows any wannabe
criminal to get an advanced ransomware campaign up and running with little expense or
complexity.
On closer look, though, the Philadelphia Ransomware is not as sophisticated as advertised.
As it is programmed in the AutoIT scripting language, it can be decompiled and analyzed for
weaknesses. On closer inspection, Fabian Wosar of Emsisoft is confident that it can be
decrypted.

Lock Screen

1/7

I was first notified of this new version by a poster in the forums who claimed he was able to
intercept communications between a person going by the handle of SkrillGuide2015 and the
Philadelphia developer The Rainmaker. This conversation was taking place on the
AlphaBay Tor criminal site, and shows Rainmaker explaining how he has started selling his
new Philadelphia ransomware project for $400 USD and that he plans on starting to
distribute it today. Rainmaker's goal was to infect 20 thousand victims on his first day of
distribution.
According to Rainmaker, Philadelphia "innovates" the ransomware market with features
such as autodetecting when a payment has been made and then automatically decrypting,
infecting USB drives, and infecting other computers over the network. Of particular note, is a
Mercy Button that allows a compassionate criminal to automatically decrypt a particular
victim's files for free. In order to demonstrate this new ransomware, Rainmaker has created
a PDF showing its capabilities.
The advertised features are:

2/7

Everything is customisable:
You can set the folders where the Ransomware will look for files as well as the
depth/recursion level
You can set the extensions, you can enable, disable and define intervals for the deadline
and the russian roulette (as well as editing how many files are deleted on every russian
roulette interval and whether the files or the crypt key gets deleted once the deadline ends
You can edit file icon and Mutex
You can edit the UAC (user access control) in four available options: (1) do not ask for
admin privilleges; (2) ask and insist until it is given; (3) ask but run anyway even if it is
not given; (4) ask and give up if it is not given
You can edit all the interface texts as well as add multiple languages to the same file (it
will detect the machine language and display the texts you edited for that locale or a
default/fallback one)
You can enable or disable USB infect, network spread and Unkillable Process, as well as
set the process name
The Philadelphia Headquarter is a software that works on your machine and allows you to
generate unlimited builds, see the victims on a map and on a list (with country flags and all the
data you need) and also a "Give Mercy" button if you're too good 0:)
But the coolest Philadelphia feature (and what makes its maintenance so cheap) is that, instead
of huge servers on our controls where you must pay high amounts monthly, we present you the
"Bridges". Bridges are the way victims and attacker enters in touch in a distributed network. It's
simply a PHP script that uses itself as database (no MySQL or whatever needed, just PHP).
Bridges store the clients keys, verifies payments and provide the victims informations to the
headquarters safely. And they can be hosted on nearly any server: even hacked servers, shared
hosting (free hosting works but it is not recommended as they can delete your account if it's not
a fully functional website), dedicated or VPS (recommended for bigger attacks, although the
requests are small and are only done a few times). As the bitcoin payment verification is done
on the server side, by the bridge, there is no way to spoof it on the victim machine. Also, the
distributed bridges network will grant a better anonimity.
Everything very well documented on a plain-english help file!

Though the bridges + headquarters client looks interesting, it has some serious flaws as
described in the next section.

Taking a Bridge to the Headquarters

3/7

For an attacker to setup a Philadelphia campaign, they need to install a PHP scripts called
Bridges on web sites. These Bridges will be connected to by the ransomware infection and
will store the encryption key and information about the victim. They are also used by the
ransomware to check if a ransom payment has been made.
The attacker then runs a management client called the Philadelphia Headquarters on their
machine, which will connect to each configured bridge and download the victim data to their
management console. This client allows the attacker to see who is infected, what countries
have the most infections, and even offers a mercy button if a compassionate attacker wants to
allow someone to decrypt their files for free.

Philadelphia Headquarters Management Console

There is a fundamental problem, though, with this Bridge implementation. Unless these
bridges are stored on anonymous networks like TOR, they will most likely be discovered and
taken down fairly quickly. As the addresses to these bridges are hard coded into the
ransomware, once the bridge is disabled, a victim no longer has the ability to pay the ransom
or decrypt their files. For this implementation to really work, an attacker would need to
setup bridges using Tor, which increases the complexity of the setup.

Another malware dev unhappy with Researcher Fabian Wosar

4/7

The first two versions of Stampado were able to be decrypted by Fabian Wosar of Emsisoft
and it also appears that this new Philadelphia variant is no exception. Like the Apocalypse
Ransomware developer, Rainmaker has not taken kindly to Fabian's attention as can be seen
by a note left in the ransomware's AutoIT script.

Insulting Fabian Wosar in the Code

How the Philadelphia Ransomware Encrypts a Victim's Files
Based on images and a mailing list software found on one of the Bridges, I believe that this
ransomware is distributed through phishing emails that pretend to be an overdue
payment notice from Brazil's Minist√©rio da Fazenda, or the Ministry of Finance. You can see
an example of the fake notice found on one of the Bridges below.

SPAM Notice

5/7

These phishing emails most likely contain a link back to the top level folder of the Bridge,
which contains a Java program that automatically downloads and executes the installer for
the Philadelphia ransomware.
When the ransomware is started, it will load an embedded configuration file that
contains directives as to how the ransomware should encrypt a computer. The
ransomware currently being distributed will target fixed, removable, and network drives, and
drive root folders. When encrypting files it will use a custom encryption algorithm and target
the following files:
*.7z;*.asp;*.avi;*.bmp;*.cad;*.cdr;*.doc;*.docm;*.docx;*.gif;*.html;*.jpeg;*.jpg;*.mdb

When a file is encrypted, its name will be scrambled and have the .locked extension
appended to it. For example, test.jpg may
become 7B205C09B88C57ED8AB7C913263CCFBE296C8EA9938A.locked.
When it is finished it will display the lock screen shown below.

Lock Screen

Last, but not least, if Russian Roulette is enabled, a counter will begin and when it runs down
to zero, a certain preconfigured amount of files will be deleted.
As already said, this ransomware is most likely decryptable for free. So if you are infected
with Stampado, or this Philadelphia variant, please do not pay the ransom. Instead, you
should ask for help in our Stampado Ransomware Help & Support Topic.
