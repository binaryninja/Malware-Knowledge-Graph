Roaming Mantis Amplifies Smishing Campaign with OS-Specific Android

May 5, 2021 feed

The Roaming Mantis smishing campaign has been impersonating a logistics company to steal SMS messages and
contact lists from Asian Android users since 2018. In the second half of 2020, the campaign improved its effectiveness by
adopting dynamic DNS services and spreading messages with phishing URLs that infected victims with the fake Chrome
application MoqHao.
Since January 2021, however, the McAfee Mobile Research team has established that Roaming Mantis has been
targeting Japanese users with a new malware called SmsSpy. The malicious code infects Android users using one of two
variants depending on the version of OS used by the targeted devices. This ability to download malicious payloads based
on OS versions enables the attackers to successfully infect a much broader potential landscape of Android devices.

Smishing Technique
The phishing SMS message used is similar to that of recent campaigns, yet the phishing URL contains the term “post” in
its composition.
Japanese message: I brought back your luggage because you were
absent. please confirm. hxxps://post[.]cioaq[.]com

Another smishing message pretends to be a Bitcoin operator and then directs the victim to a phishing site where the user
is asked to verify an unauthorized login.

Japanese message: There is a possibility of abnormal login to your
[bitFlyer] account. Please verify at the following URL: hxxps://bitfiye[.]com

During our investigation, we observed the phishing website hxxps://bitfiye[.]com redirect to hxxps://post.hygvv[.]com. The
redirected URL contains the word “post” as well and follows the same format as the first screenshot. In this way, the actors
behind the attack attempt to expand the variation of the SMS phishing campaign by redirecting from a domain that
resembles a target company and service.

Malware Download
Characteristic of the malware distribution platform, different malware is distributed depending on the Android OS version
that accessed the phishing page. On Android OS 10 or later, the fake Google Play app will be downloaded. On Android 9
or earlier devices, the fake Chrome app will be downloaded.
Japanese message in the dialog: “Please update
to the latest version of Chrome for better security.”

Please update to the latest version of Google Play
for better security!”

Because the malicious program code needs to be changed with each major Android OS upgrade, the malware author
appears to cover more devices by distributing malware that detects the OS, rather than attempting to cover a smaller set
with just one type of malware

Technical Behaviors
The main purpose of this malware is to steal phone numbers and SMS messages from infected devices. After it runs, the
malware pretends to be a Chrome or Google Play app that then requests the default messaging application to read the
victim’s contacts and SMS messages. It pretends to be a security service by Google Play on the latest Android device.
Additionally, it can also masquerade as a security service on the latest Android devices. Examples of both are seen below.
Japanese message: “At first startup, a dialog
requesting permissions is displayed. If you do not
accept it, the app may not be able to start, or its
functions may be restricted.”

Japanese message: “Secure Internet Security. Your device
is protected. Virus and Spyware protection, Anti-phishing
protection and Spam mail protection are all checked.”

After hiding its icon, the malware establishes a WebSocket connection for communication with the attacker’s command
and control (C2) server in the background. The default destination address is embedded in the malware code. It further
has link information to update the C2 server location in the event it is needed. Thus, if no default server is detected, or if
no response is received from the default server, the C2 server location will be obtained from the update link.
The MoqHao family hides C2 server locations in the user profile page of a blog service, yet some samples of this new
family use a Chinese online document service to hide C2 locations. Below is an example of new C2 server locations from
an online document:

As part of the handshake process, the malware sends the Android OS version, phone number, device model, internet
connection type (4G/Wi-Fi), and unique device ID on the infected device to the C2 server.
Then it listens for commands from the C2 server. The sample we analyzed supported the commands below with the
intention of stealing phone numbers in Contacts and SMS messages.

Table: Remote commands via WebSocket

Conclusion
We believe that the ongoing smishing campaign targeting Asian countries is using different mobile malware such as
MoqHao, SpyAgent, and FakeSpy. Based on our research, the new type of malware discovered this time uses a modified
infrastructure and payloads. We believe that there could be several groups in the cyber criminals and each group is
developing their attack infrastructures and malware separately. Or it could be the work of another group who took
advantage of previously successful cyber-attacks.
McAfee Mobile Security detects this threat as Android/SmsSpy and alerts mobile users if it is present and further protects
them from any data loss. For more information about McAfee Mobile Security, visit https://www.mcafeemobilesecurity.com.
