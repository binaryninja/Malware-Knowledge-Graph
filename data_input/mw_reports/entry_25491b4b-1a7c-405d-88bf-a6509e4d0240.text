Last week, Microsoft Corp. made headlines when it scored an unconventional if not
unprecedented legal victory: Convincing a U.S. court to let it seize control of a Chinese
Internet service provider’s network as part of a crackdown on piracy.
I caught up with Microsoft’s chief legal strategist shortly after that order was executed, in a
bid to better understand what they were seeing after seizing control over more than 70,000
domains that were closely associated with distributing hundreds of strains of malware.
Microsoft said that within hours of the takeover order being granted, it saw more than 35
million unique Internet addresses phoning home those 70,000 malicious domains.
Microsoft said Thursday that it convinced a U.S. federal court to grant it control over a botnet
believed to be closely linked to counterfeit versions Windows that were sold in various
computer stores across China. The legal victory also highlights a Chinese Internet service
that experts say has long been associated with targeted, espionage attacks against U.S. and
European corporations.
