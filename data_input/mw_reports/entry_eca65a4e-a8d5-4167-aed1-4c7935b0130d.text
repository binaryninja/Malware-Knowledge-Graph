An autonomous system (AS) is a collection of IP subnets that is managed by a single
administrative entity. Think of an ISP or a hosting provider, but also a large corporation or a
university, many of which manage one or more autonomous systems. Each AS is assigned
a unique number, called an ASN; in practice the terms AS and ASN are often used
interchangeably.
ASNs play a crucial role in routing and thus in making the Internet work. But because each
of them is managed by a single entity, it also makes sense to assign a reputation to them,
based on the amount of malicious activity hosted on the AS.
Silent Push assigns a reputation to each ASN, that takes into account both the number of
active IP addresses within the AS and the number of these that are currently being used for
malicious activities.
The reputation of an ASN reflects the current state rather than a historical reputation, so
that ASNs that shut down malicious activity will see their reputation drop immediately.
Historic reputation data is available through the API.
The following are the ASNs with the worst reputation — each of them has the maximum
reputation score of 100 — ranked by the number of IP addresses currently listed:

1/6

However, all of ASNs are all quite small, with each containing 2048 or fewer IP addresses.
They host a relatively large amount of malicious activity, but in absolute terms, their
contribution to ‘bad things on the Internet’ is pretty small.
So let’s look at those ASN with contain at least 100,000 IP addresses (active or not):

2/6

Now a number of well-known companies appear in the list, including Tencent, Digital
Ocean, Alibaba and Google.
Each of these cloud providers make it easy for someone to quickly and more or less
anonymously set up a virtual server. That has many advantages for researchers and
developers but also attracts those hosting malicious infrastructure, such as malware
authors or those providing services to them.
We would certainly not recommend blocking something just because it is hosted at any of
these providers. But something unknown hosted there definitely deserves some extra
scrutiny.

Takedown reputation

3/6

In fairness, it is unreasonable to expect a hosting provider or other network to be able to
proactively block all malicious activity on its network. After all, it’s not like a malicious actor
is open about their intentions when renting a server or purchasing a domain.
This is why at Silent Push, we also assign a ‘takedown reputation’ to each ASN, that
assigns a score from 0 to 100 that measures how well (or how badly, for 0 is the best score)
an ASN takes down malicious activity hosted on its network.
If we add the takedown reputations to the previous table, we note they are all low, but in
some cases not 0, leaving some room for improvement for these ASNs when it comes to
their due diligence in keeping the Internet free of malware and scams.

4/6

Finally, we can look at the ASNs with the worst takedown reputation. These are all pretty
small, containing 4096 IP addresses or fewer, and have a takedown reputation higher than
90:

5/6

Conclusion
Simply ranking ASNs or hosting providers by the number of IP addresses that are hosting
or have hosted malicious content ignores both their actual size and their responsiveness
when it comes to takedown requests. By including both, Silent Push provides you with a
clearer picture of what ASNs to consider somewhat suspicious, which combined with other
context can help during an investigation.
