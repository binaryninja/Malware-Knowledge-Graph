Ransomware Recap: Dec. 19 - Dec. 31, 2016

Christmas brought an unwanted surprise to one

family in 2016. On December 25, software engineer Darren Cauthon tweeted an image
showing his family's LG smart TV had been infected with ransomware. The smart TV was
disabled, and displayed a ransom note mimicking a notification from the FBI demanding a
payment of US$500. It’s worth noting that the LG TV was an older model running Google TV,
a platform that was abandoned in 2014.
Cauthon asked LG to help him restore the TV to its factory settings. At first the company told
him to bring it to a support center but eventually relented and gave him instructions for a
factory reset. The Christmas story had an eventual happy ending—the factory reset worked
and Cauthon posted a video of the process to help other smart TV owners who might
encounter the same problem.
In this particular case, the ransomware that infected the smart TV was identified as the
Android mobile ransomware FLocker. First discovered in May 2015, the notorious mobile
ransomware has since been rewritten thousands of times to evade detection. The Cauthon
incident follows the pattern of recent variants of FLocker (detected as
ANDROIDOS_FLOCKER.A): the ransomware impersonates law enforcement agencies,
accuses the victim of crimes they didn’t commit and then demands a ransom. In June of
2016, Trend Micro already recognized that it was capable of infecting smart TVs. We also
noted that it is not the first ransomware to target TVs; and with the proliferation of smart
devices across the world, it won’t be the last. Users should take steps to secure their smart
devices and be wary about the apps they download and install.
Here are some other notable ransomware stories from the last two weeks of December:
KillDisk

1/8

KillDisk is a malware well-known for being used in cyber-espionage and sabotage operations
that hit several companies in the utilities sector. The most well-known case was when it was
used in the BlackEnergy attacks that victimized Ukrainian energy companies in late
December 2015.
In mid-December of 2016, KillDisk was reportedly deployed in an operation hitting Ukrainian
banks. According to reports, after the TeleBot backdoor Trojan was installed, KillDisk deleted,
replaced, or rewrote crucial files to render computers unbootable and cover up illicit
operations. The malware is believed to be developed by the TeleBots group, which created
the TeleBot backdoor Trojan.
Now, KillDisk (detected as RANSOM_KILLDISK.A) has been updated with a ransomware
feature that encrypts targeted files and appends them with string "do not touch crypted file."
After encryption, it locks out the user and displays a simple ransom note. Other reports show
that the KillDisk ransomware component asks for a huge ransom: 222 Bitcoin, which
amounts to about US$210,000.

We have identified that KillDisk fulfills a certain purpose for cybercriminals, the ‘clean up’
after a Trojan installation to hide traces of the infection. This new ransomware update adds
another layer to that—if the victim is preoccupied by the ransomware, he or she might not

look for another type of malware infection.Koovla
Koovla (detected as RANSOM_EDA2RUNSOME.B) is a new and unusual ransomware
variant. It calls itself a Jigsaw “twin”, but doesn’t follow the behavior of the older ransomware.
After it encrypting targeted files, Koovla offers a free decryption key if the victim reads two
security articles, one about safe browsing and the other about the Jigsaw ransomware. The
motive behind this tactic is unclear, but if the aim of the ransomware operators is to raise
awareness then they follow the footsteps of other “educational” families such as EduCrypt
and Shinolocker.
In their ransom note, the ransomware operators say that if the victim is too “lazy” to read the
articles, their files will be deleted. It doesn’t seem ready for distribution though, as the sample
obtained will actually terminate if the button of its message window is clicked.
The complete text of the ransom note reads:
"Hello, I'm nice Jigsaw or more commonly known as Jigsaws twin.
Unfortunately all of your personal files (pictures, documents, etc...) have beenencrypted by
me, an evil computer virus know as 'Ransomeware'.

Now now, not to worry I'm going to let you restore them but only if you agree to stop
downloading\unsafe applications off the internet.

If you continue to do so may end up with a virus way worse than me! You might even end up
meetingmy infamous brother Jigsaw :(

While you're at it, you can also read the small article below by Google's security team on
how to stay safe online.
Oh yeah I almost forgot! In order for me to decrypt your files you must read the two articles
below, once you have click the \"Get My Decryption Key\" button.

Then enter in your decryption key and click the \"Decrypt My Files\" button. Eventually all of
your files will be decrypted :)
If the timer reaches zero then all of your personal files will be deleted because you were too
lazy to read two articles.”

Adam Locker
3/8

Adam Locker (detected as RANSOM_ADAMLOCK.A) encrypts targeted files on a victim’s
system but offers them a free decryption key which can be accessed through Adf.ly, a URL
shortening and advertising service. Victims just need to click on the "Open" button on the
ransom note and they are led to adf[.]ly/1h2U8c. The shortened link redirects them to
http://adamlocker[.]000webhostapp[.]com/key.html, a page that shows the decryption key.
This ransomware veers away from traditional extortion techniques: instead of demanding
ransom from victims directly, it uses them to earn money through Adf.ly’s payment scheme.
The company promises that people can “earn money just by posting links”. Adf.ly typically
shows ads before leading users to their intended link, and the link posters get paid for driving
traffic to the ads.
The company compensates each poster every time their link is clicked —the more views, the
more money earned. The ransomware operators are simply driving up their page views and
making money by abusing this legitimate service.

DeriaLock
Another ransomware family that was spotted during the Christmas holidays was DeriaLock.
First seen on Christmas Eve and updated only a few days after, this particular family asks
victims to contact a Skype account for the ransom payment.
The first variant (detected as RANSOM_DERIALOCK.A) was only a screenlocker. The
second variant (detected as RANSOM_DERIALOCK.B) was updated with an encryption
routine and appends .deria to the names of files that it encrypts.
Even after the update, victims are still asked to contact a Skype account for payment
purposes. The amount demanded is actually US $10 less than the first variant. The updated
version also has a progress bar showing the time allotted for paying the ransom: 1 day. If
payment is not made by that time, it claims that it will delete all private files.

Hidden Tear variants
Two new Hidden Tear-based variants were spotted in late December 2016. The first is
KoKoKrypt (detected as RANSOM_HIDDENTEARKOKO.A), which is a very straightforward
ransomware. It encrypts files and adds the extension .kokolocker. Victims are served a
ransom note demanding .1 Bitcoin, or US$90.
The second is the Guster ransomware (detected as RANSOM_HIDDENTEARGUSTER.A). It
uses the extension .locked. This particular ransomware has an animated screenlocker with a
voice-over and a 48:00:00 countdown. The ransom is set at .4 Bitcoin, or roughly $365.
The continuing emergence of Hidden Tear variants shows just how dangerous open source
ransomware is. Opportunistic malware developers will abuse any available resource.
