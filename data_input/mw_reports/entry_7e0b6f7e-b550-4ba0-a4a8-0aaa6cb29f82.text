Mini Stealer’s Builder & Panel released for free
During a routine threat hunting exercise, Cyble Research and Intelligence Labs (CRIL) discovered a
post on a cybercrime forum where a Threat Actor (TA) released MiniStealer’s builder and panel for
free.
The TA claims that the stealer can target operating systems such as Windows 7, 10, and 11. Using
such builders, TAs can easily generate malicious payloads. MiniStealer mainly targets FTP applications
and Chromium-based browsers.

Figure 1 – Post on a cybercrime forum
Nearly a month after the release of MiniStealer, the same TA made a post selling Parrot Stealer’s
builder and panel for USD 50. The TA stated that this stealer is based on MiniStealer. We suspect that
the TA might have added the functionalities in Parrot stealer which were missing in MiniStealer.

Builder and Web Panel
The zip file leaked by TA contains two folders, as shown below. These folders contain the following
files:

Builder:
MiniStealerBuilder.exe, Stub
Panel:
Web Panel Source code

Figure 4 – Leaked Files

The builder released by the TA is a .NET-based binary. It has the functionality to add the Command
and Control (C&C) details to the payload. The builder loads a file named “stub,” which is the actual
payload, and then writes the C&C details to it for generating the final payload.
The test button shown in the figure below sends the Test Logs to the C&C server to check if the
connection can be established. These logs contain three connection strings TestUser, TestPass, and
TestHost.

The TA has also released the source code of the web panel, which can be used to receive stolen data
from a target network. The figure below shows the web panel.

Mini Stealer is a 64-bit .NET-binary that uses Timestomping. Timestomping is a technique that modifies
the timestamps of a file. Adversaries use this technique on their payloads to deflect any unnecessary
attention during forensic investigations.

Figure 7 – File Details
The stealer uses multiple AntiAnalysis checks to prevent debugging of the sample. To detect profiling,
the code verifies if the COR_ENABLE_PROFILING environment variable is present and set to 1.
Profilers are designed to monitor, troubleshoot, and debug managed code executed by the .NET
Common Language Runtime. The figure below showcases the stealer detecting profiling.

Figure 8 – Detecting profiling
This stealer spawns a thread for continuously checking if the stealer payload is being debugged. To
check for the presence of debuggers, this thread executes methods such as IsDebuggerPresent,
OutputDebugString, and Debugger.IsLogging.

Figure 9 – Anti-Analysis
This stealer payload steals data from the following Chromium-based browsers and FTP applications.
The stealer appears to be in the development stage as several FTP applications are hardcoded in the
stealer, but it does not appear to target all of them.
The TA might have added these functionalities in Parrot Stealer, which is suspected to be an upgraded
paid version of MiniStealer. For the FTP application, the stealer steals data from configuration files. For
browsers, the stealer copies certain files for exfiltration present in the AppData\Browser directory, which
stores user session and login credentials, as shown in the figure below.

CuteFTP, Cyberduck, Dreamweaver, FreeFTP, DirectFTP, ftpcommander, FTPEXPLORER, FTPRush,
FTPvoyager, LeapFTP, MultiCommander, SmartFTP, SuperPutty, TotalCommander, TurboFTP, WSFTP,
WinSCP

Conclusion
The availability of free malware builders and panels can assist TAs in carrying out attacks, as TAs do
not need to invest time and money to get malware payloads for cybercrime purposes. There is always
the possibility that TA might have released the builder and panel of MiniStealer for free for marketing
purposes and to build a reputation amongst themselves on cybercrime forums.
The TA’s behavior further reinforces this theory as after 1 month; they began selling a paid stealer,
which is suspected to be based on MiniStealer. CRIL continuously monitors emerging threats and has
observed a surge in the use of stealer malware by TAs.

Our Recommendations
We have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against
attackers. We recommend that our readers follow the best practices given below:
How to prevent malware infection?
Avoid downloading pirated software from warez/torrent websites. The “Hack Tool” present on
sites such as YouTube, torrent sites, etc., contains such malware.
Use strong passwords and enforce multi-factor authentication wherever possible.
Turn on the automatic software update feature on your computer, mobile, and other connected
devices.
Use a reputed anti-virus and internet security software package on your connected devices,
including PC, laptop, and mobile.
Refrain from opening untrusted links and email attachments without first verifying their
authenticity.
Educate employees in terms of protecting themselves from threats like phishing’s/untrusted
URLs.
Block URLs that could be used to spread the malware, e.g., Torrent/Warez.
Monitor the beacon on the network level to block data exfiltration by malware or TAs.
