Experts discovered a new wiper, tracked as CaddyWiper, that was
employed in attacks targeting Ukrainian organizations.
Experts at ESET Research Labs discovered a new data wiper, dubbed CaddyWiper, that
was employed in attacks targeting Ukrainian organizations.
The security firm has announced the discovery of the malware with a series of tweets:
#BREAKING #ESETresearch warns about the discovery of a 3rd destructive wiper
deployed in Ukraine
. We first observed this new malware we call #CaddyWiper

CaddyWiper does not share any significant code similarity with #HermeticWiper,
#IsaacWiper or any other malware known to us. The sample we analyzed was not
digitally signed. 3/7https://t.co/EGp9NnctD9

“This new malware erases user data and partition information from attached drives,” ESET
Research Labs reported. “ESET telemetry shows that it was seen on a few dozen systems in
a limited number of organizations.”

CaddyWiper is the third wiper observed by ESET in attacks against Ukraine after
HermeticWiper and IsaacWiper, experts pointed out that it does not share any significant
code similarity with them.
Similar to HermeticWiper deployments, CaddyWiper being deployed via GPO, a
circumstance that suggests the attackers had initially compromised the target’s Active
Directory server.
In order to maintain access to the target organization while still disturbing operations, the
CaddyWiper avoids destroying data on domain controllers. CaddyWiper uses the
DsRoleGetPrimaryDomainInformation() function to determine if a device is a domain
controller.
Information from the PE header of CaddyWiper suggests it was compiled the same day
it was deployed to targeted networks. 6/7 pic.twitter.com/Ay363IRGzX

The CaddyWiper sample analyzed by ESET was not digitally signed, the malware was
compiled.
Microsoft researchers also observed another wiper that was employed in attacks against
Ukraine, it was tracked as WhisperGate.
In Mid-February, the Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) today revealed the country was the
target of an ongoing “wave of hybrid warfare” conducted by Russia-linked malicious actors.
Threat actors aim at destabilizing the social contest in the country and instilling fear and
untrust in the country’s government. Data wiper usage was part of this hybrid warfare
strategy.
