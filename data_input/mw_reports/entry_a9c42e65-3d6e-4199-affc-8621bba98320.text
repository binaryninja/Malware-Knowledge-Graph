Six Russian GRU Officers Charged in Connection with Worldwide Deployment of
Destructive Malware and Other Disruptive Actions in Cyberspace

Caution:
On October 15, 2020, a federal grand jury sitting in the Western District of Pennsylvania
returned an indictment against six Russian military intelligence officers for their alleged roles
in targeting and compromising computer systems worldwide, including those relating to
critical infrastructure in Ukraine, a political campaign in France, and the country of Georgia;
international victims of the “NotPetya” malware attacks (including critical infrastructure
providers); and international victims associated with the 2018 Winter Olympic Games and
investigations of nerve agent attacks that have been publicly attributed to the Russian
government. The indictment charges the defendants, Yuriy Sergeyevich Andrienko, Sergey
Vladimirovich Detistov, Pavel Valeryevich Frolov, Anatoliy Sergeyevich Kovalev, Artem
Valeryevich Ochichenko, and Petr Nikolayevich Pliskin, with a computer hacking conspiracy
intended to deploy destructive malware and take other disruptive actions, for the strategic
benefit of Russia, through unauthorized access to victims’ computers. The indictment also
charges these defendants with false registration of a domain name, conspiracy to commit
wire fraud, wire fraud, intentional damage to protected computers, aggravated identity theft,
and aiding and abetting those crimes. The United States District Court for the Western
District of Pennsylvania issued a federal arrest warrant for each of these defendants upon
the grand jury’s return of the indictment.
