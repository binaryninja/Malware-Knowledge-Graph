We have just released an updated decryption tool for Shade (Troldesh) Ransomware. As a
long-established family of ransomware, Shade has been in operation since 2014, and has
been operating consistently ever since.
In late April 2020, its operators announced that they are stopping the Shade operation and
publicly released around 750,000 decryption keys hinting that cyber-security companies
should build a better decryptor than theirs.
TL;DR, just show me the download
You can download the decryptor here to get your files back for free.

If you are interested in how the tool works, we have more information below.
Technical description:
This tool recovers files encrypted by Shade/Troldesh ransomware. While it might be easy for
the untrained eye to mistake it with Crysis/Dharma ransomware, Shade is quite different in
several ways. One can tell this ransomware family and version apart by the extension it
appends to the encrypted files, by some 10 similar ransom-notes or by the way encrypted
files are named (base64):
Extensions used for encrypted file names:

.ytbl
.breaking_bad
.heisenberg
.better_call_saul
.los_pollos
.da_vinci_code
.magic_software_syndicate

.windows8
.no_more_ransom
.tyson
.crypted000007
.crypted000078
.rsa3072
.decrypt_it

.miami_california

Ransom-notes:

User Ids, required for key match, are also found in encrypted file names, for most
ransomware sub-versions. For older versions of the malware, the ID can be recovered from
ransom-notes, or by brute-forcing the limited set of released keys.

By default malware comes with some public RSA3072 keys, which are used to encrypt files,
if no server responds within several hours. The authors released the entire set of encryption
keys used in all malware versions in a public Github repository.
While victims whose systems could successfully connect to server would have custom
encryption keys, those who got infected with no active connection would have been
encrypted by hardcoded RSA public keys.
The set of dynamic generated keys and uploaded to ransomware owner servers take up to
1.8GB (~749K), the static shipped private keys are are only 1.6K in size, and do not exceed
4MB.
Our decryption tool is able to identify on the fly corresponding keys, cache them, and apply
faster on subsequent decryption attempts. The tool does not require any additional input
from the user in order to decrypt. It requires an active internet connection to compute the
dynamic keys, should files have been infected in online mode.

How to use this tool
Step 1: Download the decryption tool below and save it on your computer.
Download the Shade decryptor
Note: This tool REQUIRES an active internet connection, as our servers will attempt to reply
the submitted ID with a possible valid RSA-3072 private key. If this step succeeds, the
decryption process will continue.
Step 2: Double-click the file (previously saved as BDParadiseDecryptor.exe ) and allow it to
run by clicking Yes in the UAC prompt.
Step 3: Agree to the End User License Agreement

At the end of this step, your files should have been decrypted.
If you encounter any issues, please contact us via the e-mail address specified inside the
tool.
If you checked the backup option, you will have both the encrypted and decrypted files at the
end of the process. You may also find a log describing decryption process in
%temp%\BDRemovalTool folder:
To get rid of your left encrypted files, just search for files matching the extension and remove
them in bulk. We do not encourage you to do this, until you double-check your files can be
opened safely and there is no trace of damage.
Do not remove large files, as their decryption may be tricky, and we may have some
updates for specific cases where decryption may have failed.
