Introduction
This week, we've seen IcedID (Bokbot) distributed through thread-hijacked emails with PDF
attachments. The PDF files have links that redirect to Google Firebase Storage URLs
hosting password-protected zip archives. The password for the downloaded zip archive is
shown in the PDF file. The downloaded zip archives contain EXE files that are digitallysigned using a certificate issued by SSL.com. The EXE file is designed to install IcedID
malware on a vulnerable Windows host.
Today's diary reviews an IcedID infection generated on Tuesday 2023-04-11.

Traffic From an Infected Windows Host
Link from the PDF file:
hxxp://80.77.23[.]51/lndex.php
Above URL redirected to:
hxxps://firebasestorage.googleapis[.]com/v0/b/logical-waters377622.appspot.com/o/MCRERY0iJA%2FDocs_Inv_April_11_450.zip?
alt=media&token=799ca8a7-44ce-44e8-b93d-a346faaf0ea3
Caused when running the extracted EXE, because the EXE was digitally signed using a
certificate from SSL.com:
hxxp://www.ssl[.]com/repository/SSLcom-RootCA-EV-RSA-4096-R2.crt
Note: The above URL is not malicious, but it's an indicator for this particular infection
chain.
Installer EXE for IcedID retrieves gzip binary:
172.86.75[.]64 port 80 - shoterqana[.]com - GET / HTTP/1.1
IcedID C2:
192.153.57[.]82 port 443 - villageskaier[.]com - HTTPS traffic
162.33.178[.]40 port 443 - deadwinston[.]com - HTTPS traffic
Final words
Running recent IcedID samples in a lab environment this week generated IcedID
BackConnect traffic over 45.61.137[.]159 over TCP port 443 (reference) and
193.149.176[.]100, also using TCP port 443 (reference). 443 is a new TCP port for IcedID
7/8

BackConnect traffic, which previously used TCP port 8080. These two IP addresses are
good indicators of an on-going IcedID infection if you find traffic to these servers from your
network.
