New Voicemail-Themed Phishing Attacks Use Evasion Techniques and Steal
Credentials
zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/new-voicemail-themed-phishing-attacks-use-evasion-techniques-and-steal-credentials

In July 2020, researchers at ThreatLabZ observed an increase in the use of voicemail as a theme for social engineering
attacks. Through the intelligence gathered from the Zscaler cloud, we discovered several newly registered domains that use
VoIP and voicemail as themes for their credential-stealing phishing campaigns. In the most recent instance we saw, attackers
were spoofing Cisco’s Unity Connection voicemail platform.
This social engineering campaign is specifically designed to reach end users in large enterprises. The use of voicemail
delivered in an email message, and the use of phishing pages that spoof enterprise applications, such as Office 365 and
Outlook, signal the attackers’ motives. If successful in obtaining a user’s credentials, attackers can access confidential data
from the enterprise, potentially selling it or holding it for ransom. They can also leverage company information to launch
targeted attacks, which can give them an even greater foothold in the network and cause extensive damage and potential loss
for the enterprise.
In this blog, we will describe how the current attacks are being carried out, the campaign’s variants and evasion techniques,
and the various social engineering tactics in use.

Distribution method
The attacks are being distributed through email with an HTML attachment that contains JavaScript code which redirects the
user to the credential phishing site.
Contents of the email are crafted to mimic a system-generated voicemail notification, luring the user to open the attachment to
access the recorded voice message as shown in Figure 1.

HTML attachment analysis
We observed different variants of HTML attachments used in these credential-phishing campaigns.

Variant #1
The email attachment is an HTML file that contains a short code snippet of JavaScript. It uses window.location.replace() to
redirect the user to the phishing site, as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2: Contents of HTML attachment
We discovered more than 200 HTML email attachments of this variant, and we observed the following similarities between
them.
All of these HTML attachments followed the naming convention:

Play_VN_<string_of_11_digits>.html

An icon of a telephone was used in the filename for social engineering purposes
All these HTML attachments have a very low detection rate on VirusTotal as shown in Figure 3 below.
Furthermore, the first sample of this variant was observed in the wild on April 21, 2020; the fact that this theme is still being
used suggests that the threat actors have achieved decent success with it.

Variant #2
In the second variant, the HTML attachment contains JavaScript code that is used to decode the next-stage HTML. It uses a
simple URL encoding which is decoded using the unescape() function and then loaded in the browser as shown in Figure 4.

The decoded content shown in Figure 5 uses the meta-refresh tag to redirect the user to the target credential phishing site.

Phishing content loaded remotely using JavaScript
In a few variants of the phishing landing pages, we observed that the final landing page used an external JavaScript to display
the credential-phishing page in the browser. Figure 6 shows the source code of the phishing page; the highlighted part is the
external JavaScript used to display the phishing content. All of these external JavaScript files use long filenames of 32
characters resembling an MD5 hash.

Unlike common credential-phishing landing pages, we can see in this case that there is no information related to the brand
being targeted. This allows the threat actors to bypass many automated URL analysis engines and extend its survival.
Figure 7 shows the relevant JavaScript code and where the user’s credentials are being sent. This code is present in randomly
named and externally hosted JavaScript files.

Figure 8 shows a sample packet capture which highlights the method used to exfiltrate the stolen credentials to the attacker’s
site. It sends the credentials in the Base64-encoded format.
It is important to note that in the first attempt, this phishing page will always give the "password incorrect" message, which
prompts users to enter their passwords more cautiously the next time.

Captcha-based evasion technique
In one of the campaigns related to voicemail, attackers used Google’s reCAPTCHA on the landing page to evade automated
URL analysis, as shown in Figures 9 and 10.

Users will be redirected to the main credential-phishing page after solving the captcha. The final phishing page spoofs the
Microsoft Office 365 login page, as shown in Figures 11 and 12.

XYZ top-level domain abuse
Below is a list of domains we identified that were registered between June and mid-July 2020 and were used by the threat
actor(s) for conducting credential-phishing campaigns using the voicemail theme.

6/12

novoips[.]xyz
voced-mxd[.]xyz
voicenotes-sms[.]xyz
newvmwav-voi[.]xyz
xvxvoip[.]xyz
vmpla-yvmc[.]xyz
voip-sms[.]xyz
voipmails-srv[.]xyz
voipsms-ss[.]xyz
voicemail-srv[.]xyz
voicemail-sms[.]xyz
These domains share some similarities in their naming convention:

All the domains were using the top-level domain (TLD) of XYZ
The domain names contained keywords such as “voip,” “voicemail,” and “sms” for social engineering purposes
Most of these domains were registered with the German-based hosting service: “1und1”
The URL pattern used for credential phishing is: hxxp://domain_name.xyz/?e=<email_address>
The parameter e in the URL corresponds to the recipient's email address
If the URL is accessed directly without the email address in the URL as a parameter, the user will be redirected to the
office.com site

We can see that the attackers took several measures to ensure that automated URL analysis cannot be performed and the
URLs look convincing to the end user.
Other TLDs that were abused by the threat actor in this campaign are: .club and .online. The complete list of domains used in
this variant of the campaign are mentioned in the Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) section at the end of this blog.

Cisco Unity Connection spoofed theme
On July 6, 2020, we observed in the Zscaler cloud several connection attempts to the domain: secure.ciscovoicemail.cf which
is a site created by the threat actor to spoof Cisco’s Unity Connection voicemail portal, as shown in Figure 13.

An icon of an audio file is displayed to the user. Once this icon is clicked, the user is redirected to the credential-phishing
landing page, which is designed to target multiple brands, as shown in Figure 14.

Figure 14: Landing page targeting multiple brands

Below is the list of brands targeted by this campaign.
Office 365
Mimecast
Outlook Web Access (OWA)
Gmail
Yahoo
Others (generic)
Once the user clicks on any of the above links, a corresponding phishing page is displayed. As an example, the OWA phishing
page is displayed (Figure 15) when the user clicks the “Outlook Web Access” link on the web page.

Zscaler’s detection status
Zscaler’s multilayered cloud security platform detects indicators at various levels, as seen here:
HTML.Phish.Microsoft
HTML.Phish.Office365

Conclusion
This threat actor leverages well-crafted social engineering techniques and combines them with evasion tactics designed to
bypass automated URL analysis solutions to achieve better success in reaching users and stealing their credentials.
As an extra precaution, users should not open attachments in emails sent from untrusted or unknown sources. As a best
practice, in general, users should verify the URL in the address bar of the browser before entering any credentials.
The Zscaler ThreatLabZ team will continue to monitor this campaign, as well as others, to help keep our customers safe.
