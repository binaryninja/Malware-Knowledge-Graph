On July 26, using the internal automated system for monitoring open-source repositories, we
identified four suspicious packages in the Node Package Manager (npm) repository. All
these packages contained highly obfuscated malicious Python and JavaScript code. We
dubbed this malicious campaign “LofyLife”.

your titles as per the Chicago manual of style)

The Python malware is a modified version of an open-source token logger called Volt
Stealer. It is intended to steal Discord tokens from infected machines, along with the victim’s
IP address, and upload them via HTTP. The JavaScript malware we dubbed “Lofy Stealer”
was created to infect Discord client files in order to monitor the victim’s actions. It detects
when a user logs in, changes email or password, enables/disables multi-factor authentication
(MFA) and adds new payment methods, including complete bank card details. Collected
information is also uploaded to the remote endpoint whose address is hard-coded.
Data is exfiltrated to Replit-hosted instances:
life.polarlabs.repl[.]co
Sock.polarlabs.repl[.]co
idk.polarlabs.repl[.]co
Kaspersky solutions detect the threat with the following verdicts:
HEUR:Trojan.Script.Lofy.gen
Trojan.Python.Lofy.a
We are constantly monitoring the updates to repositories to ensure that all new malicious
packages are detected.

Andariel deploys DTrack and Maui ransomware
Earlier, the CISA published an alert related to a Stairwell report, “Maui Ransomware.” Our

Kaspersky ICS CERT experts detected a wave of targeted attacks in several East European
countries, as well as Afghanistan. Of the six backdoors identified on infected systems, five
have been used earlier in attacks attributed to APT TA428.
