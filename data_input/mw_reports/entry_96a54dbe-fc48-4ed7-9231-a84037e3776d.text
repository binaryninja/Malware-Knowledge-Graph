An Analysis of the BabLock (aka Rorschach) Ransomware
This blog post analyzes a stealthy and expeditious ransomware called BabLock (aka
Rorschach), which shares many characteristics with LockBit.

A ransomware called BabLock (aka Rorschach) has recently been making waves due to its
sophisticated and fast-moving attack chain that uses subtle yet effective techniques.
Although primarily based on LockBit, the ransomware is a hodgepodge of other different
ransomware parts pieced together into what we now call BabLock (detected as
Ransom.Win64.LOCKBIT.THGOGBB.enc). Note, however, that we do not believe that this
ransomware originates from the threat actors behind LockBit, which is now in its third
iteration.
In this blog entry, we look at its attack chain in detail and examine its likely origins.

Discovery
In June 2022, we discovered a ransomware (which turned out to be BabLock) using what
appeared to be a unique style of appending extensions, where instead of the normal “one
sample, one extension” method commonly used in ransomware attacks, we discovered that
the attackers were appending numerical increments from 00-99 on top of the fixed
ransomware extension for this specific infection. As a result, even on a single infected
machine, there could be multiple extension variations from a single execution.

Our investigation found that the ransomware was always deployed as a multi-component
package consisting mostly of the following files:
The encrypted ransomware file, config.ini
A malicious sideloaded DLL (DarkLoader, a config.ini decryptor and ransomware
injector)
A non-malicious executable used to load the malicious DLL
A CMD file to execute the non-malicious binary using the correct password

The DarkLoader DLL will check for specific commands, particularly --run, which checks for
the correct 4-digit password needed to start the encryption process. Although it bears little
significance to the unpacking of the contents of config.ini itself, the DLL will execute the
fundamental ransomware routine if supplied correctly.

with the whole encryption process
Once the DLL component is loaded by the non-malicious executable, it will immediately look
for the config.ini file in the current executable’s path. Once this is found, the DLL decrypts
config.ini and then executes notepad.exe with a certain set of command lines.
For this particular campaign, we found a few notable and consistent patterns:
The main ransomware binary is usually delivered as an encrypted config.ini file.
DarkLoader is executed via DLL sideloadingusing legitimate executables.
The config.ini file is decrypted by a specially crafted loader designed specifically for
these campaigns (detected as Trojan.Win64.DarkLoader)
BabLock appends a random number from 00 to 99 to the extension string per file within
the same infected machine (for example, extn00-extn99 as extensions in the same
infection).
Any DarkLoader DLL can be used to decrypt any encrypted ransomware config.ini, with
no specific binary pairing needed.
The DarkLoader DLL uses Direct SysCall APIs to a select few, but important, calls to
avoid API reading analysis.
The decrypted BabLock ransomware is always packed with VMProtect for antivirtualization.
BabLock is loaded via the threat injection of a hooked API Ntdll.RtlTestBit to jump to
memory containing the ransomware code.
There have been a few variations of the passcode for --run across different attacks, but
all of them are still within a certain range of each other.

ransomware on recent attacks.

Subtle but sophisticated
Throughout our initial encounter with BabLock in June 2022, we searched for similar files
and found that the earliest record of these files dated back to March 2022. After discovering
this, we wanted to find out how it managed to stay under the radar for so
long.
Since June 2022, there have only been a handful of recorded incidents involving the
ransomware, including the most recent one. Due to a low number count, no notable statistics
involving region, industry, or victim profile have stood out as of the time of writing.

Figure 7. Distribution of incidents involving the BabLock ransomware
However, due to its notable features and characteristics, attacks related to BabLock can be
easily identified. As we’ve already mentioned, after every file encryption, the ransomware
appends a random number string between 00-99 to its hardcoded extension. This results in
up to 100 different variations of the same ransomware extension.

encrypted files
It also has a fairly sophisticated execution routine:
It uses a specific number code to execute properly.
It splits the package into multiple components.
It separates and hides the actual payload into an encrypted file.
It uses normal applications as loaders
Finally, BabLock employs publicly available tools as part of its infection chain. We found that
the most used tools were the following:
Chisel - A transmission control protocol (TCP) and user datagram protocol (UDP)
tunnel
Fscan - A scanning tool
6/10

By using these two tools — combined with BabLock/LockBit possessing the capability to set
active directory (AD) Group Policies for easier propagation — it’s possible for a malicious
actor to navigate around a network without much effor

Comparing and contrasting BabLock to LockBit and other
ransomware
From our investigation, most of the routines used by BabLock are more closely related to
Lockbit (2.0) than any other ransomware. Other researchers also mention similarities to
ransomware such as Babuk, Yanluowang and others.
Initially, we suspected it to be related to the DarkSide ransomware due to ransom note
similarities. However, unlike the DarkSide ransomware, BabLock removes shadow copies by
executing the following command lines:
vssadmin.exe delete shadows /All /Quiet
Therefore, we immediately ruled this relationship out since it’s different to the way DarkSide
does things, which is deleting shadow copies through Windows Management
Instrumentation (WMI) and PowerShell (which is technically more sophisticated and difficult
to detect through standard monitoring tools).

Figure 9. The ransomware binary decrypts and executes the command line to delete shadow
copies.
One of its common characteristics to Lockbit (2.0) would be the use of the same group policy
to generate a desktop drop path. Similarly, the use of vssadmin for deleting shadow copies is
also a routine heavily used in LockBit attacks (albeit also a common routine for many modern
ransomware). Still, the resemblance is uncanny. Furthermore, it is running the same
commands to execute GPUpdate for the AD. Due to this, our detection for this ransomware
is still under the LockBit family.

that of LockBit (right)
From what we can tell, BabLock looks like a Frankenstein-like creation that is stitched
together from different known ransomware families.

Insights and conclusion
Our first encounter with BabLock almost coincided with the release of Lockbit v3.0. However,
since most of its structure still resembles Lockbit v2.0, we surmise that this may be from
another affiliate or group. With nearly a year since the release of LockBit v3.0, we have
found no changes to the payload of the BabLock even with recent attacks, further solidifying
our stance that they are neither connected nor closely affiliated with the actual LockBit group.
What we do know is that the threat actor behind BabLock managed to take many of the base
capabilities of LockBit v2.0 and added bits and pieces of different ransomware families to
create their own unique variant, which could possibly be enhanced further in the future.
Recommendations
Organizations can implement security frameworks to safeguard their systems from similar
attacks, which systematically allocate resources to establish a robust defense strategy
against ransomware. Below are some recommended guidelines that organizations may want
to consider:
Taking an inventory of assets and data
