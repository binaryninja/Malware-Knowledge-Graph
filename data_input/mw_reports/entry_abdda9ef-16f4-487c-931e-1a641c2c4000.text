Trend Micro | 2Q Report on Targeted Attack Campaigns

Introduction
Highly targeted attacks refer to a category of threats that pertain to intrusions by threat actors
or attackers. These attackers aggressively pursue and compromise chosen targets in order to
steal sensitive information. These are not conducted through separate attacks; rather, they
comprise of a series of attempts over time to get deeper and deeper into a target’s network.
Each attempt may either succeed or fail, but the overall goal is to penetrate the target’s network
and acquire information. Malware is typically used as an attack vector, but the real threat
involves human operators who adapt, adjust, and improve their methods based on the victim’s
defenses.
Enterprises should consider targeted attacks a high-priority threat because of the considerable
damage they incur. The human and systemic weaknesses that allow an attacker to compromise
an organization can be minimized and mitigated with correct practices and solutions. However,
these same weaknesses can never be fully resolved.
Trend Micro monitors the targeted attack landscape in order to identify ongoing campaigns and
provide additional threat intelligence useful for identifying the existence of these campaigns
in an enterprise network. This quarterly report presents the targeted attack campaigns
observed and mitigated by Trend Micro based on reported customer cases, as well as our own
independently gathered data.

Trend Micro | 2Q Report on Targeted Attack Campaigns

Campaigns Observed in 2Q
Targeted Attack Campaigns Profiling
We encountered a variety of targeted campaigns in the second quarter of the year.
These include the following:
•

IXESHE. The IXESHE campaign is known for targeting East Asian
governments, electronics manufacturers, and telecommunications firms. We
released a white paper discussing this campaign.1 IXESHE has been active since
2012.

•

ELISE. This recently discovered campaign also targets government agencies
in the Asia Pacific region. It is called ELISE after certain strings found
in its unpacked code. (We detect the malware used by this campaign as
BKDR_ELISE.)

•

ZEGOST. This family of backdoors (aka HTTP Tunnel) is Chinese in origin
and was used in attacks against Asian government organizations.

•

BEEBUS/MUTTER. This is a targeted campaign believed to be associated
with the Comment Crew attacker group because of the use of encrypted/
obfuscated HTML comments to hide their C&C transactions.

•

TravNet. This campaign made use of a malware family identified as NetTraveler
based on the strings found in the malware code. The malware is detected as
BKDR_TRAVLAR.

Trend Micro | 2Q Report on Targeted Attack Campaigns

Attachments Used In Targeted Attacks
Based on our findings, the most common type of email attachment type used in targeted
attacks were file archives of various forms. When uncompressed, these archives typically
contain the malicious payload itself, which the user may then run directly. Alternately,
they may also contain a .DOC file that contains exploit code. RTF files made up the
second most common file type.

File types used in targeted attacks

Frequently, the .EXE files we see are made to appear as ordinary documents or folders
using appropriately chosen icons. In addition, we also saw an increased use of files that
make use of right-to-left override (RTLO) in Unicode.

C&C Statistics
We were also able to monitor the activity of various C&C servers related to targeted
attacks. By volume of C&C server activity, the following countries ranked as follows:

Feature: EvilGrab Campaign Targets Diplomatic Agencies
In this report, we will provide a detailed analysis of the EvilGrab campaign. This campaign
was first found targeting certain Asian and European governments. Its name is derived from
its behavior of grabbing audio, video, and screenshots from affected machines.
Currently, the malware used by EvilGrab belongs to one of three malware families:
•

BKDR_HGDER

•

BKDR_EVILOGE

•

BKDR_NVICM

Targets
Our research indicates that EvilGrab activity is most prevalent in China and Japan,
although it is also present in other parts of the world. Government organizations were,
by far, the most affected by EvilGrab. This geolocation is based on the IP addresses of
the victims. Therefore, foreign institutions within China would be identified as coming
from China; the same would hold true for all countries. EvilGrab was also found in the
United States, Canada, France, Spain, and Australia, among others.

Trend Micro | 2Q Report on Targeted Attack Campaigns

Attack Vectors
Research indicates that EvilGrab is primarily distributed through spear-phishing emails
with malicious attachments that exploit various vulnerabilities to run malicious code.
Among the attachment types are:
•

Microsoft® Excel® spreadsheets (CVE-2012-0158 and CVE-2012-2543)

•

PDFs (CVE-2013-0640)

•

Microsoft® Word® documents (CVE-2012-0158)

A .RAR file with a folder named thumbs.db was also seen containing malicious code.
By using this name, the intention was to disguise itself as the Windows thumbnail
cache. A shortcut file (.LNK) was also seen in the .RAR file, which used a folder icon
to make users believe it was another folder. In reality, running the .LNK file executes
the malware. In addition, the .RAR file contains a desktop.ini file in order to change the
thumbs.db folder icon into the icon of the Windows thumbnail cache.

Exploits, Payloads, and Decoy Documents
The EvilGrab campaign’s use of exploits, payloads, and decoy documents is similar to
the Taidoor campaign in 2012.2 The primary difference is that EvilGrab variants have
multiple layers of shellcode. In addition, some variants copy the file name and use it as
the decoy document file name. Other variants overwrite the exploit document with the
contents of the decoy document.
As noted above, some variants also use disguised folders and shortcuts and do not use
exploits to run their code.

DLL Preloading Using the Windows Shell and Fax Server
DLL preloading is a vulnerability that has been documented for over three years.3 The
EvilGrab campaign makes use of this vulnerability for its AutoRun routine.
Whenever it is run, the Windows shell (explorer.exe) loads a component of the fax server
in Windows, fxsst.dll. This is normally located in the System32 folder. Whenever an
instance of explorer.exe is launched (i.e., at every system startup), the system searches for
the said .DLL file and loads it.
EvilGrab drops one of its .DLL components in the Windows folder, where explorer.
exe is also located. The malicious .DLL (also named fxsst.dll) is loaded instead of the
legitimate copy. It also serves as the loader of the main backdoor.

9

Trend Micro | 2Q Report on Targeted Attack Campaigns

While DLL preloading has been used by other malware in the past, it is less common
to see it specifically target explorer.exe. Other malware families that use this vulnerability
typically target executable files outside of Windows; EvilGrab targets a part of Windows
itself.

Other Autorun Behaviors
In addition to the above behavior, EvilGrab also creates the following registry entry to
enable its automatic execution at every system startup:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
UKey = “%Application Data%\360\Live360.exe”

The file %Application Data%\360\Live360.exe is a copy of one of the malware
components. It also creates a shortcut under the Startup folder in the Start menu:
•

IEChecker.lnk
•

Target: “%UserProfile%\IEChecker.exe” –L

•

Icon: %Full path of Iexplorer.exe% (This uses the Internet Explorer icon
and disguise itself as part of Internet Explorer.)

The above file is also a copy of one of the malicious components.

Stealth Operation
EvilGrab has three primary components: one .EXE file and two .DLL files. The .EXE
file acts as the installer for all of the EvilGrab components. One of the .DLL files
serves as a loader for the other .DLL file, which is the main backdoor component.
Some variants of EvilGrab delete the .EXE file after installation to cover its tracks more
effectively. As noted earlier, the loader file is named fxsst.dll. However, examination of
its header states that its actual file name is supposed to be svchost.dll.
These components are also encrypted and saved in the registry. To add stealth to its
backdoor routines, it uses a legitimate process context’s memory space to inject the
main backdoor.

10

Trend Micro | 2Q Report on Targeted Attack Campaigns

By default, this backdoor injects itself into the svchost.exe or winlogon.exe process. It also
checks if certain processes related to certain security products are running on the
affected system. The specific processes targeted are:
•

avp.exe

•

klwtblfs.exe

•

starter.exe

•

wmifw.exe

Other variants of this malware also check if other security products are present. It is
not clear why EvilGrab specifically targets these products. However, it is possible that
the attackers determined that targets for this campaign are likely running these products.

Registry Storage
EvilGrab stores its components in the following registry entries:
HKCU\Software\rar and/or HKLM\SOFTWARE\rar
data = {Encrypted copy of the main backdoor DLL}
s = {Encrypted copy of the loader DLL}
e = {Encrypted string which points to the full path of
the installer EXE}

		

Media Grabbing
To capture video, EvilGrab creates a capture window with the class name of ESET.
It uses the Sample Grabber filter (part of the DirectShow technology in Windows) to
directly perform grabbing.4 It also uses Wave APIs to capture audio.5

User Credential Theft
EvilGrab steals user credentials related to the following applications and/or protocols:
•

HTTP

•

HTTPMail

•

IMAP

•

Internet Explorer (IE)

•

Microsoft Outlook

11

Trend Micro | 2Q Report on Targeted Attack Campaigns

•

MSN

•

POP3

•

Protected Storage

•

SMTP

•

Windows Messaging

EvilGrab steals these credentials by parsing the following registry keys:

		

• HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\
Windows Messaging Subsystem\Profiles
• HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows Messaging Subsystem\Profiles
• HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Internet Account Manager\Accounts
• HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\Outlook\
OMI Account Manager\Accounts

It queries the above keys for related values that correspond to the applications and
protocols listed earlier. The values are then decrypted using the system library pstorec.dll.
It also steals login credential from IE autocomplete entries. It does this by first parsing
the index.dat files in the IE History folder. It then collects autocomplete entries from
the following registry key:

HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\IntelliForms\Storage2

It then initiates a brute force attack on encrypted credentials using the CryptUnprotectData
API. However, it will only try to steal passwords from IE’s password-protected sites
and MSN Explorer Signup if kav.exe (related to a security product) is not running in the
system.

12

Trend Micro | 2Q Report on Targeted Attack Campaigns

Tencent QQ Memory Reading
If the active window is Tencent QQ (specifically, QQ2009 through QQ2012), EvilGrab
will attempt to steal information by directly reading the process’s memory and checking
if the class name of the focused window is not named “EDIT.”
The contents of the process’s memory are then saved onto the system’s hard drive as
%UserProfile%\users.bin. It is then sent back to the backdoor’s C&C server. The file on
the hard drive is encrypted; specifically, the data is XORed with the key 0x66.

Key Logging
EvilGrab also possesses keylogging capabilities. The logged keystrokes are then sent
back to the C&C and saved to %User Profile%\users.bin. The file on the hard drive is
encrypted; specifically, the data is XORed with the key 0x66.

13

Trend Micro | 2Q Report on Targeted Attack Campaigns

Command & Control Servers
Each backdoor has one to three C&C servers in its code. Some of C&C servers that we
have seen from our accumulated data are as follows:
•

112.121.182.150

•

113.10.246.46

•

113.10.190.55

Backdoor Activity
To start its connection to its C&C server, the backdoor component will first send
5-bytes (\x01\x00\x00\x00\x33). The C&C will reply if it accepts the connection.
The backdoor then replies with a beacon message, the contents of which are as follows:

Trend Micro | 2Q Report on Targeted Attack Campaigns

Either backdoor identifier 1 or backdoor identifier 2 acts as the campaign code or
marker for EvilGrab campaigns, which is recognizable by the C&C server and/or
attacker. Some of the identifiers we saw in backdoor identifier 1 are:
•

006

•

007

•

0401

•

072002

•

3k-Ja-0606

•

3k-jp01

•

4k-lyt25

•

88j

•

e-0924

•

LJ0626

•

RB0318

Some of the identifiers seen in our accumulated data in backdoor identifier 2 are as
follows:
•

V2010-v16

•

V2010-v24

We noted a correlation between the MZ/PE headers of variants and the strings in
backdoor identifier 2. Variants with a V2010-v24 identifier have a proper MZ/PE
header; variants with a V2010-v16 header have portions of their header overwritten with
JPEG strings. These variants require a loader component to load them into memory in
order to be executed.

These capabilities can be used for both lateral movement within a compromised
organization and to steal information. EvilGrab steals internal user names and passwords
as well as logs keystrokes. Credentials stolen this way can be used to move within the
confines of the organization’s network.
EvilGrab possesses a wide variety of information theft capabilities. It can grab audio
and video files directly from devices attached on the system (i.e. microphone and
camera). In addition, EvilGrab can upload files from the affected system to remote
servers. EvilGrab possesses a full range of capabilities that is expected in malware used
in targeted attacks against organizations.

20

Trend Micro | 2Q Report on Targeted Attack Campaigns

Trend Micro Recommendations
Targeted attacks pose a challenge to traditional signature-based security solutions. To deal with
these type of threats, employ solutions that include network monitoring to detect and analyze
incoming threats, as well as any outgoing communication with attacking parties.
Products like Trend Micro™ Deep Discovery™ are capable of mitigating the risks from these
threats. One component of Deep Discovery, the Deep Discovery Inspector, provides network
threat detection, custom sandboxing, and real-time analysis and reporting.
The second component, Deep Discovery Advisor, provides sandbox analysis of known and
unknown threats that augments the capabilities of existing products like endpoint solution and
email/web gateways. It also provides visibility to network-wide security events.
The capabilities provided by solutions like Deep Discovery are necessary to provide a unified,
comprehensive view of the threats an organization faces. This information can then be used
by an organization to create appropriate and proportional responses to properly protect an
organization’s network.
