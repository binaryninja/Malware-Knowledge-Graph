ICS-CERT Incident Response Summary Report
2009−2011
OVERVIEW
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Control Systems Security Program manages and operates
the Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) to provide focused
operational capabilities for defense of control system environments against emerging cyber threats.
To accomplish this mission, ICS-CERT
•

responds to and analyzes control systems related incidents,

•

conducts vulnerability and malware analysis,

•

provides onsite support for incident response and forensic analysis,

•

provides situational awareness in the form of actionable intelligence,

•

coordinates the responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities/mitigations, and

•

shares and coordinates vulnerability information and threat analysis through information products and
alerts. a

This report provides a summary of cyber incidents, onsite deployments, and associated findings from the
time ICS-CERT was established in 2009 through the end of 2011. The report is divided into three main
sections:
1. The first section gives a summary of incident reports and outlines major highlights for each year.
Statistics are given for incident response support as well as onsite deployments. Typical incident
response support consists of analysis performed in the Advanced Analytics Lab (AAL) on digital
media, malware, log files, and other artifacts. Companies request analysis support from ICS-CERT to
help determine the extent of the compromise and gather information about cyber attacks including the
adversary’s techniques and tactics. This information helps asset owners evaluate their security posture
and take measures to strengthen their control systems and network security.
2. The second section examines the onsite response efforts in detail and gives a summary of each
deployment. At the request of a company and when appropriate, ICS-CERT can deploy an onsite
incident response team to help triage a cyber incident affecting a critical infrastructure
owner/operators with the purpose of identifying threat vectors, collecting data for analysis, assisting
with immediate mitigation efforts, providing cybersecurity threat briefings, and identifying future
defense strategies.

3. The third section presents common findings from onsite vulnerability assessments and discusses
security gaps that asset owners should address to improve the secure posture of their systems.
PROTECTING INFORMATION
Organizations submitting information to DHS regarding cyber incidents can request that their information
be designated as Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) under the Critical Infrastructure
Information Act (the CII Act) of 2002. Under the CII Act, information designated as PCII is protected
from disclosure through a Freedom of Information Act request or through a request under a similar state,
tribal, or territorial disclosure law and is protected from regulatory uses. In addition, the identity of the
submitting organization is protected from disclosure to the public. ICS-CERT’s practice is to use cover
names for organizations it assists (such as “Energy 2” or “Transportation 3”) to obfuscate their actual
names.
SECTION 1: INCIDENT RESPONSE SUMMARY
Reviewing all incidents reported to and correlated by ICS-CERT from 2009 b through 2011 provides
context for the industrial control system (ICS) threat landscape during this period. Figure 1 compares all
3 years and shows the growth in reported and identified incidents impacting organizations that own and
operate control systems associated with critical infrastructure.

The following sections summarize the incidents reported to ICS-CERT for each year, including incident
highlights, onsite deployment services, and analysis activities conducted by the team.
2009
REPORTED INCIDENTS
In 2009, ICS-CERT’s inaugural year, nine incident reports were received, four were confirmed as actual
incidents. Of those, two resulted in the deployment of onsite response teams. An additional two incidents
involved remote analysis by the AAL to identify the threat and recommend mitigation strategies. The

Figure 3. Incident reports by sector (2010).
ICS-CERT received multiple reports of secure shell (SSH) brute force attacks attempting to access ICS
and critical infrastructure companies who operate ICS. Although this type of activity was commonly
recognized in the IT sector, these incidents marked an increased awareness of the attack potential and
attractiveness of targeting ICS. ICS-CERT published a report titled “CSAR-10-088-01—SSH BruteForce Scanning and Attacks” to inform asset owners about how to identify brute force scanning and
attacks, how to mitigate the risks, and when to report an incident.
Multiple spear-phishing incidents were also reported. Reports came from several sectors, but the Energy
Sector accounted for two-thirds of these incidents. All the spear-phishing incidents reported to ICS-CERT
involved sophisticated or advanced persistent threat actors.
Several notable threats from 2010 include:
Mariposa infections in CIKR. Defence Intelligence identified the Mariposa botnet in May 2009.
Although the primary command and control (C2) infrastructure was taken down in December of that year,
ICS-CERT continued to receive malware infection reports into early 2010, at least one of which resulted
in an onsite incident response to determine whether the malware had breached the control system
network. The operations executed by the botnet were diverse, in part because parts of the botnet could be
rented by third-party individuals and organizations. Confirmed activities include denial-of-service attacks,
email spam, theft of personal information, and changing the search results a browser would display in
order to show advertisements and pop-up ads. c
Stuxnet was discovered; ICS-CERT deploys an onsite incident response team to a Stuxnet infected
facility. Stuxnet, the first ever malware specifically written to target ICS, was discovered in 2010. ICSc. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariposa botnet

CERT analyzed the malware and its impacts to control systems in coordination with various government
agencies, law enforcement, industry, and other organizations such as Symantec, Microsoft, CERT Bund,
Siemens, and various sector ISACs (i.e., Energy, Chemical, Nuclear, Dams, Water, Transportation). ICSCERT issued advisories with multiple updates to provide mitigation information to critical infrastructure
asset owners and operators. ICS-CERT also conducted an onsite incident response deployment to a
manufacturing facility infected with the Stuxnet malware and helped the organization identify all infected
systems and eradicate the malware from their control system network (see page 8, “Onsite Incident
Response Activities” for more details).
2011
REPORTED INCIDENTS
In 2011, ICS-CERT received 198 reports of incidents. Of those 198, seven resulted in the deployment of
onsite incident response teams. An additional 21 incidents involved analysis efforts by the AAL to
identify malware and techniques used by the threat actors. Figure 4 displays the sector distribution for all
incidents reported in 2011. Incidents specific to the Water Sector, when added to those that impacted
multiple sectors, accounted for over half of the incidents due to a large number of Internet facing control
system devices reported by independent researchers.

Many of these Internet facing control systems employed a remote access platform from the same vendor,
configured with an unsecure authentication mechanism. ICS-CERT coordinated with the vendor to
mitigate the authentication vulnerability and also took on the task of identifying and notifying the affected
asset owners. ICS-CERT provided them with details of the risks associated with weak boundary

protection practices and assisted with mitigation strategies. As a result, ICS-CERT published a new alert
titled “ICS-ALERT-11-343-01—Control Systems Internet Accessibility” to update the public on the risk
associated with Internet accessibility to control system devices.
A similar incident occurred in January 2012, in which ICS-CERT identified an organization that appeared
to be compromised based on information discovered in open source forums. After analyzing the data,
ICS-CERT established contact with the impacted facility owners and informed them of the open source
posting of their control systems information. Facility personnel reported to ICS-CERT that they had
already discovered the compromise and unauthorized adjustments to the Energy Management System
control settings that had resulted in unusually warm temperatures in the facility. The organization acted
quickly when they discovered the intruder and adjusted their network configuration to eliminate Internet
accessibility. The organization, however, was not aware that sensitive information about their system was
on the Internet or of the malicious IP address associated with the compromise.
ICS-CERT also responded to multiple incidents involving sophisticated and targeted spear-phishing
campaigns against asset owners in the Nuclear, Energy, Government, and Chemical Sectors. In some
cases, emails were convincingly crafted and appeared to be from corporate executives or other trusted
sources in an attempt to lure users into opening malicious attachments or links. Once compromised,
attackers often map out networks in order to perform a variety of functions including stealing credentials,
exfiltrating sensitive information such as financial, research or operational data, and establishing multiple
footholds to maintain persistent presence for future operations. In all cases, ICS-CERT works with
reporting organizations to help determine if the control network was compromised and provides
mitigations to detect and mitigate the activity.
Some examples include:
•

ICS-CERT worked with several companies that were part of the Night Dragon d attacks, first publicly
reported in February 2010, targeting global oil, energy, and petrochemical companies. Hackers
moved deliberately through the victim’s networks, trolling for sensitive data and intellectual property.

•

ICS-CERT worked with several organizations impacted by the Nitroe attacks, where companies
involved in research and development of chemical compounds and materials were the targets of
sophisticated attacks. Reports indicated that the attackers gathered data from across the victim
networks and moved it to internal staging servers to make data exfiltration more efficient.

These incidents highlight the activity of sophisticated threat actors and their ability to gain access to
system networks, avoid detection, use advanced techniques to maintain a presence, and exfiltrate data.
ICS-CERT also collaborated with the international cybersecurity community working with over
30 different countries and, in most cases, interfacing directly with the international Computer Emergency
Response Teams (CERTs) to coordinate responses and reach out to affected organizations and vendors.

SECTION 2: ONSITE INCIDENT RESPONSE SUMMARY
Onsite incident response support to critical infrastructure asset owners and operators impacted by cyber
incidents is an important aspect of ICS-CERT capabilities. Deploying a team onsite is always conducted
at the request of the asset owner/operator and only when appropriate thresholds have been met.
ICS-CERT provided onsite support to critical infrastructure asset owners on 17 separate occasions: two in
2009, eight in 2010, and seven in 2011. In all cases, ICS-CERT performed network topology reviews
while onsite, to include a thorough review of the interconnections between ICS and enterprise networks,
existing security and logging mechanisms, and interviews with personnel to describe existing procedures
and common practices. ICS-CERT also left asset owners with recommendations for strengthening overall
cybersecurity and enhancing incident response capabilities and procedures.
INCIDENT RESPONSE GOALS
ICS-CERT performs incident response with four primary goals.
1. Provide one-on-one support to the impacted organization to characterize the nature of the attack
(actors, malware, techniques, and tactics) and determine the extent of compromise.
2. Develop guidance for the impacted organization and recommend a path for recovery and future
protection. ICS-CERT does not provide direct recovery services but is always available to clarify the
recovery recommendations.
3. Leverage the information obtained from onsite response activities to provide situational awareness
warnings and alerts to the rest of the critical infrastructure and key resources community (without
attribution to the affected organization).
4. Collect threat actor indicators, techniques, tactics, and procedures to correlate with other incidents
and share with National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center partners.
The following provides a brief synopsis of each onsite response effort by year and by impacted sector.
2009 ONSITE INCIDENT RESPONSE
Water
ICS-CERT deployed an incident response team to a municipal water treatment plant that had reported an
incident that was thought to include a compromise of their control systems network. ICS-CERT obtained
digital artifacts, including a hard drive from the suspected compromised host for analysis. Analysis of
digital artifacts concluded that there was no targeted malicious activity against the water treatment plant’s
business or control systems network. The overall cyber defense and incident response capabilities at this
facility were low, and ICS-CERT provided recommendations and resources for hardening its security
posture and enhancing its response capabilities.

Energy
An electric utility detected a suspicious cyber event and requested support from ICS-CERT. ICS-CERT
performed memory forensic analysis and provided onsite support. The analysis concluded that the
network had not been compromised as initially expected. ICS-CERT conducted a thorough network
topology review and provided recommendations for implementing better detection mechanisms.
2010 ONSITE INCIDENT RESPONSE
Energy
ICS-CERT deployed an incident response team to an Energy Sector organization that was targeted by a
spear-phishing email campaign, which was successful in compromising and exfiltrating data from the
enterprise network. The ICS-CERT incident response team performed network traffic analysis, both live
and historical, to identify additional machines that may have been involved. In total, ICS-CERT analyzed
11 drives from the affected organization that were suspected as compromised as a result of logged DNS
queries to known bad domains. Analysis of the drives produced indicators of a rootkit, malware specific
to the victim’s network, and characteristics of a known and sophisticated threat actor, all of which
supported the premise that this had been a targeted attack. The suspected attack vector was spearphishing, and ICS-CERT believes that it is highly likely that data were exfiltrated from this organization’s
network. ICS-CERT provided extensive indicators for use by the organization to identify, mitigate, and
eradicate the threat.
Nuclear
ICS-CERT deployed an onsite incident response team in response to an incident in the Nuclear Sector
resulting from the presence of crimeware on the enterprise network. The team evaluated six 6 hard drives
while on site and found indicators of malware related to the Mariposa botnet. The infection occurred
when an employee attended an industry event and used an instructor’s universal serial bus (USB) flash
drive to download presentation materials to a laptop. The USB drive was infected with the Mariposa
botnet and when the user connected the laptop to the corporate network upon returning to work, the virus
spread to over 100 hosts on the enterprise network. ICS-CERT, in conjunction with the company,
identified all infected computers and provided recommendations for eradicating the virus from their
network. ICS-CERT confirmed that the compromise did not impact control processes or operations.
Interestingly, interviews with the employee revealed that other nuclear industry personnel had also used
the same infected USB drive at the industry event and their laptops were likely infected as well. ICSCERT obtained the instructor’s name, contacted him to inform him of the infected drive, and requested a
list of attendees for notification purposes. The instructor declined the offer and said that he would reach
out to the entities himself to inform them of the malware. Unfortunately, ICS-CERT was not able to
verify if the companies were ever contacted and to what extent they may have been impacted.

Manufacturing
ICS-CERT deployed an incident response team to a critical manufacturing organization after receiving a
report of an intrusion by a sophisticated threat actor into the organization’s enterprise network. While
onsite, ICS-CERT identified infected systems, obtained log files, and provided mitigation strategies to the
organization. Through analysis, ICS-CERT determined that the source of the compromise appeared to be
a sophisticated threat actor, based on analysis of the path and mechanism of the initial entry point and
indicators found on the hard drive images. The entry point was a spear-phishing email with specific and
highly relevant content for that organization and a malicious .zip file attachment. Exfiltration of data from
the organization was suspected, but due to the lack of available logging, was unable to be confirmed. The
compromise did not impact control processes and operations.
Energy
ICS-CERT deployed an incident response team to an electric utility after receiving a request from support
from the organization. This utility requested onsite support during a scheduled outage to review its control
system and enterprise network architecture, identify potential vulnerabilities, and recommend mitigation
strategies for an improved security posture. The utility had noted anomalous activity on its network, but
had already completed the initial stages of incident management and had begun to perform the root cause
failure analysis necessary to guide business and architectural improvements to its various network
environments. This organization possessed mature cybersecurity capabilities and maintained a high level
of preparedness to respond to a cyber incident. ICS-CERT provided an in-depth architectural review and
threat assessment of the incident after the incident had been contained and provided the utility with
additional recommendations.
Energy
ICS-CERT deployed a team to an oil and gas company after they identified compromised hosts on its
network that were communicating to malicious IP addresses as a result of a malware infection. The
company received several spear-phishing emails to a number of internal recipients, and indications
showed that the spear-phishing emails were opened by multiple recipients. ICS-CERT and US-CERT
coordinated a joint onsite incident response and analysis effort. The spear-phishing email included a .zip
attachment containing a .chm file, compressed binary Help files (that display results information via
HTML), and exploitation code. Extensive analysis indicated that the compromise was limited to the
enterprise network and did not extend to the control system network and process operations. ICS-CERT
and US-CERT analyzed their network topology and provided recommendations for mitigating the
sophisticated intrusion as well as enhancing their overall security posture.
Manufacturing
ICS-CERT deployed an incident response and analysis team to a critical manufacturing facility infected
with the Stuxnet malware. ICS-CERT deployed a team of analysts to the facility and confirmed the
presence of Stuxnet on all their engineering workstations as well as several other machines connected to
their manufacturing control systems network. The malware was verified to be the same as the one
previously analyzed in ICS-CERT’s malware laboratory. ICS-CERT worked with the asset owner to
ICS-CERT Incident Response Summary

develop and implement a multi-staged Stuxnet removal process, customized for their network, and
confirmed that the infection had been eradicated prior to leaving. ICS-CERT also left the facility with
procedures and mechanisms for detecting and removing any future Stuxnet infections.
Energy
ICS-CERT deployed an incident response and analysis team to an energy sector organization to review an
incident relating to a sophisticated threat actor and potential data exfiltration from its network. The
organization had experienced a series of spear-phishing attacks against their users and they were able to
detect and monitor the resulting intrusion and the exfiltration of data. The organization had a mature
security posture which enabled them to quickly contain the incident. The onsite response team helped
perform a defensive gap analysis of the network using known threat indicators. ICS-CERT verified that
the organization’s containment strategy addressed the potential attack pathways and provided technical
recommendations for detecting and mitigating future attacks.
Energy
ICS-CERT deployed an incident response and analysis team to an Oil and Gas company after the
organization reported that a series of spear-phishing emails targeting members of their organization. It
was suspected that information was being exfiltrated. During this onsite response effort, the ICS-CERT
team met with the organization to support mitigation efforts from the incident. The organization had
begun the initial stages of incident management and ICS-CERT assisted the organization in evaluating
their network topology, understanding the threat, examining logs for indicators of further compromise,
and discussion of the findings and relevant defensive strategies for mitigating the threat and improving
their overall security posture.
2011 ONSITE INCIDENT RESPONSE
Water
ICS-CERT deployed an incident response team to a water organization that reported a compromise of its
remote terminal server. The ICS-CERT incident response team performed throughout analysis of the
infected host and of the associated malware. Analysis concluded that an infection of the remote terminal
server had occurred and that the infection was non-targeted and consistent with crimeware, not a
sophisticated threat. Further analysis of logs confirmed this finding as the logs showed that the infected
host had been communicating with known crimeware hosts. The ICS-CERT team worked with the
organization to identify the scope of the incident and the most probable points of entry, allowing the
organization to develop a more effective strategy for mitigating future attacks and strengthen its remote
log-in practices.
Energy
ICS-CERT deployed an incident response team to a bulk electric power organization that had been the
victim of a broader spear-phishing campaign against the nuclear/energy sectors. ICS-CERT analyzed
multiple digital artifacts, including three malware samples and detected evidence of a sophisticated threat

ICS-CERT Incident Response Summary

actor; the point of entry appeared to have been an employee opening a PDF attachment of a spoofed
industry-specific newsletter, which contained the malware. Following execution, a non-malicious PDF
was presented to the user. Command and control was positively identified as part of this analysis and
ICS-CERT provided indicators and mitigation strategies to this organization to detect further infections
on their network and take appropriate defensive measures to combat the threat. The recommendations
given to this organization also included security recommended practices and mitigation techniques
specific to the threat actors.
Government
ICS-CERT deployed an incident response team to a government facility after a malfunction of a PLC
controlling backup generators at one of their facilities. This partial loss of backup power affected nonvital services. The ICS-CERT incident response team performed a security assessment of the government
facility’s control systems network and collected log files and other digital artifacts for further analysis.
ICS-CERT confirmed through analysis that there was no evidence of a cyber incident that resulted in the
malfunction of the PLC and the resultant impact to non-vital services. ICS-CERT provided the
government facility with recommend practices to enhance their security posture.
Government
A government organization requested support from the ICS-CERT to investigate suspicious cyber activity
involving their internally-managed building management control systems. ICS-CERT provided on-site
support and conducted analysis detected no evidence of malicious cyber activity. The response team
provided guidance and recommendations on best practices to improve their cyber security posture for
defense against future cyber threats.
Energy
ICS-CERT deployed an incident response team to an electric utility that had been targeted by a broader
spear-phishing campaign. ICS-CERT conducted analysis on three suspected malicious PDF files provided
by the organization. From this analysis, ICS-CERT determined that two of the PDF files were known
malicious and made requests to known malicious domains. However, post- analysis of digital artifacts and
interviews with utility personnel, including the targeted employee uncovered that all attempts were
unsuccessful. ICS-CERT provided the organization with indicators to detect compromise based on
analysis of the malicious email, and the utility determined that their network had not been compromised.
Water
ICS-CERT deployed an incident response team to a water utility that appeared to have evidence of an
unauthorized login to their control systems network. Initial reporting indicated that a pump had failed as
result of changes made in the control systems environment. ICS-CERT conducted analysis and interviews
with the organization (and their support contractors) and determined that the unauthorized login was in
fact an authorized user logging into the control system while on personal business in a foreign country for
legitimate business purposes. The owner confirmed this as legitimate system access. Further analysis of
the network logs and telemetry data on the control systems network found no evidence of an unauthorized

ICS-CERT Incident Response Summary

login, malicious intrusion, or compromise. ICS-CERT also provided recommendations to the water utility
on methods of improving the security of remote access to their controls system.
Because of the media attention given to this incident, ICS-CERT later published a report in coordination
with the asset owner.
Chemical
ICS-CERT deployed an incident response team to a chemical industry organization that had reported
anomalous activity on its network. The ICS-CERT incident response team analysis of its systems found
two suspicious files running in memory. ICS-CERT examined network logs for evidence that company
hosts had communicated with malicious IP addresses during the timeframe surrounding the infection
period and found indicators of compromise in several locations on the network. Based on the indicators
discovered, ICS-CERT concluded that a sophisticated adversary compromised multiple machines and
uploaded tools onto the network. Review of the network topology showed that the organization had a flat
network and lacked other defensive technologies for a secure system. ICS-CERT provided
recommendations for improving the network defensive posture and the architecture of their network.
ICS-CERT recommended that the organization continue to use improved defensive technologies to
continue to evaluate the full extent of the compromise and eradicate the attacker from the network.

SECTION 3: COMMON FINDINGS
This section summarizes key metrics from onsite deployments and common findings from incident
response events.
KEY METRICS FROM ONSITE DEPLOYMENTS
An analysis of the onsite deployment events provides some key findings regarding the threat
environment, methods of detection, and incident response activities. These findings highlight areas for
improvement in protecting control systems networks.
THREATS
The most common infection vector for network intrusion was spear-phishing emails with malicious links
or attachments. Spear-phishing accounted for 7 out of 17 incidents. At least one incident involved an
infection from a removable USB device.
Sophisticated threat actors were present in 11 of the 17 incidents, including the actors utilizing spearphishing tactics to compromise networks. These threat actors were responsible for data exfiltration in
several cases, which seems to have been the primary motive for intrusion. No intrusions were identified
directly into control system networks. However, given the flat and interconnected nature of many of these
organization’s networks, threat actors, once they have gained a presence, have the potential to move
laterally into other portions of the network, including the control system, where they could compromise
critical infrastructure operations.
In 12 of 17 cases, implementation of security recommended practices, such as login limitations and
segmenting networks with properly configured firewalls, could have deterred the attack, significantly
reduced the time to detect the attack, or at least reduced the impact of the incident.
DETECTION
Properly developed and implemented detection methods are the best strategy to quickly identify
intrusions and implement mitigation and recovery procedures. Most of the organizations to which
ICS-CERT responded were not prepared with adequate detection techniques. In 3 of the 17 onsite
responses, the asset owners had been notified of the event or intrusion by external organizations. In two
additional cases, the incident had been identified by a hired third party (consultant or integrator). For one
asset owner, server administrators identified unusual activity that led to the discovery of a phishing
compromise. Equipment failure was responsible for two reported incidents that led to the deployment of
onsite response teams. The following statistics from the 17 incidents highlight the value of using
detection capabilities to identify a compromise.
Ten organizations could have detected the intrusion by using ingress/egress filtering of known bad IP
addresses or domain names.

ICS-CERT Incident Response Summary

Page 13 of 17

In seven incidents, file indicators were used by the incident response team to confirm the compromise and
identify the threat.
In three incidents, traffic was observed to known bad IP addresses or domain names, allowing the
response team to identify the threat actor.
RESPONSE
In three cases, ICS-CERT responded with onsite deployments to incidents and determined that the attacks
were not targeted at the asset owner. In the other onsite response situations, the infection vector could not
be determined. Several common issues or concerns emerged during these incident responses. Many
organizations did not have sufficient logging capabilities enabled and were unable to provide valuable log
data for analysis. In some cases, the forensic images that were sent to the AAL for analysis were created
long after the event occurred. By then, important timestamps had been overwritten and a reliable timeline
could not be established. Similarly, running antivirus scanning after an intrusion can overwrite
timestamps. ICS-CERT has developed guidance for preserving forensic data and provides this
information (ICS-CERT Incident Handling Brochure) during incident response efforts to help network
administrators preserved forensic data for analysis. Updates are posted to the ICS-CERT web page at
http://www.ics-cert.org.
COMMON FINDINGSALL INCIDENTS
Through analysis of the findings from the onsite incident response events, the incident reports, and the
results from over 150 onsite assessments using the CSET, f ICS-CERT has identified common trends in
operational security gaps in control systems environments. These findings can be broken down into three
major categories:
1. People
2. Process
3. Technology.
The following sections summarize the most common cybersecurity gaps associated with each of these
categories.
PEOPLE
An organization’s personnel can contribute to cybersecurity gaps when they 1) lack understanding of the
overall security risk to control systems, 2) do not consider the technical and security impacts of
inadequate security policies or implementation thereof, and/or 3) lack the cybersecurity skills needed to
provide protection of its network against cyber attacks. In other words, personnel may not believe the

ICS-CERT Incident Response Summary

Page 14 of 17

threat is credible, or they don’t see themselves as a target, or they lack the knowledge and capabilities to
implement adequate protective measures.
Cybersecurity gaps can occur when personnel at all levels of an organization do not clearly understand
security risks to the control systems environment. This includes management, IT operations, security
operations, process operations, control systems, and incident response operations. Until critical
infrastructure organizations see themselves as probable targets and gain an understanding of the threat
actor capability to penetrate, avoid detection, and maintain a presence on their networks, they will not
make the necessary investments in cybersecurity. To address this gap, ICS-CERT strives for improved
information sharing and outreach efforts by continually providing situational awareness to the ICS
community in the form of alerts, advisories, and briefings.
Cybersecurity gaps also can occur when personnel have an insufficient understanding of the technical
impacts of inadequate security policies. Organizations often fail to develop common technical and
security standards for the IT and control systems components of their environments. Without such
standards, it may be impossible to create an effective security posture. Organizations should integrate
business requirements and technical needs when developing security strategies. Changing default user
names and passwords on vendor equipment and placing ICS remote logon sites behind firewalls with
VPN protection are two examples of policies that are readily implemented and will significantly improve
an organization’s security posture.
Gaps in the necessary cybersecurity skills can result from limited resources and funding or from a lack of
understanding of security needs in relation to the organization as a whole. The primary reasons for this
gap in skill mix often include the following:
•

Failure to perform risk and consequence analyses of a successful cyber attack and develop a business
case for investing in cyber security

•

Failure to hire individuals or a team dedicated to perform security operations for the organization as a
whole

•

Failure of organizations that have identified cybersecurity subject matter experts to allocate enough
time and training to fulfill the role at the required level

•

A lack of situational awareness regarding cyber threats and inadequate polices to guide the
implementation and maintenance of technical security solutions, such as policies for managing
removable media or guidance for personnel to spot and defend against threats from spear-phishing
attacks

•

Failure to consider technical administration of control systems and corporate IT networks as a core
business function that crosses all business silos. This limits communication among technical
administrators, business owners, and technology end users, resulting in gaps relating to how the
technology is designed, procured, and secured.

ICS-CERT Incident Response Summary

Page 15 of 17

PROCESS
An organization’s processes can result in cybersecurity gaps for the following reasons.
•

Lack of or insufficient incident response planning or processes to prevent or inhibit cyber events,
detect intrusions, and preserve forensic data for analysis and recovery strategies.

•

Lack of policies or processes for moving security operations from a tactical level to a core business
competency across business functions (i.e., IT operations, security operations, process operations,
control systems).

•

Lack of or insufficient security strategies and policies necessary to develop adequate security maturity
throughout the organization. This also includes a clear policy addressing removable media,
particularly when and where its use is allowed within the organization.

•

Lack of minimum functional and security standards necessary to develop the following:
−
−
−
−

Adequate functional IT operational requirements and best practices
Necessary security operations strategy and technical architecture
Adequate control systems and process operations security requirements plan
Adequate training and qualification of personnel.

TECHNOLOGY
An organization’s technology can result in cybersecurity gaps for the following reasons.
•

Control systems environments risk assessments do not identify or prioritize most significant technical
risks and potential impacts to operations that would support the business case for investing in
cybersecurity.

•

Lack of security management framework, which results in an inconsistent tactical security posture at
each of the following levels:
−
−
−

•

Lack of network segmentation, both physically and logically.
Network segmentation using firewalls is a network design approach that offers a number of
security advantages to an organization.
It involves separating a network into smaller functional networks that can than restrict the extent
at which an intruder can easily move laterally through the network.

Patch Management
−
−

Lack of adequate patch management policies and practices to address known vulnerabilities and
ensure up-to-date protection of common cybersecurity threats.
Organizations should also develop test environments to assess possible impacts of patches prior
to implementation in the operating environment.

•

User access controls
−
−
−

•

Insufficient ingress/egress traffic filtering due to lack of a functional network baseline
Network architecture not adequate for security needs

Firmware
−

•

Allowing uncontrolled user logons across network segments
Uncontrolled network access by vendors
Default user name and passwords not changed in applications, etc.

Network communications
−
−

•

Lack of configuration management policies and practices to ensure changes to the network
topology are tracked and assessed for impacts to security.

Embedded systems do not support incremental security changes

Operating system
−
−

Lack of integrated security expertise (control systems, sec ops, IT ops, process) prohibit
development of compensating controls
Lack of systems development life cycle (SDLC) by vendor, integrator, or operator prevents
adequate security controls from being implemented.

GOING FORWARD
ICS-CERT and the ICS community have worked together successfully to identify and mitigate malicious
cyber activity in critical infrastructure assets, but much remains to be done. As discussed, reports from
various organizations enabled ICS-CERT to analyze incident data from their networks and create an
overall view of the incidents in progress. This would not have been possible without the active
cooperation of the reporting organizations. ICS-CERT encourages ICS companies to report cyber
incidents for tracking, correlation, and support.
Sophisticated and targeted cyber intrusions against ICSs across multiple critical infrastructure sectors
continue to increase. ICS-CERT developed guidance (ICS-TIP-12-146-01) to provide basic
recommendations for owners and operators of critical infrastructure to mitigate the impacts of cyber
attacks and enhance their network security posture.
In 2012, ICS-CERT continues to provide situational awareness information about the emerging threats
and incident response services to assist with mitigation and recovery efforts.
