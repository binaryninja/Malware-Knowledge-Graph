Zeus Panda Banking Trojan Targets Online Holiday Shoppers

2/7

December 14, 2017 Proofpoint Staff
Overview
Banking Trojans work by injecting code into web pages as they are viewed on infected machines, allowing the
malware to harvest banking credentials and credit card information as victims interact with legitimate sites. Most
often, the injects -- the code that actually performs the man-in-the-browser attacks -- are configured for regionspecific banking sites. More recently, we have seen injects for online payment sites, casinos, retailers, and more
appearing in banking Trojan campaigns.
Since November -- a period of time that includes Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Cyber Monday and now leading up
to Christmas -- we have observed Zeus Panda banking Trojan campaigns that have an increasing focus on nonbanking targets with an extensive list of injects clearly designed to capitalize on holiday shopping and activities.
More specifically, these Zeus Panda (aka Panda Banker) campaigns expanded their injects to a variety of online
shopping sites for brick and mortar retailers like Zara, specialty online retailers, travel sites, and video streaming
sites, among others. The vast majority of these new targets will potentially see higher-than-normal numbers of
credit card transactions for the holidays. While Zeus Panda can be configured to steal a variety of information,
these injects collected the credit card number, address, phone number, DOB, SSN, and security question-related
information such as mother’s maiden name.
Analysis
On December 11, a campaign targeted UK business users with a fake resume attachment named “resume.doc”
(Figure 1) delivered via email. The subject line “Application submitted from Gumtree Jobs by [First Last Names]
for Field Sales Consultant - Status: Emailed” referenced a job application via “Gumtree Jobs”, a legitimate jobs
and classified advertising platform with users in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. The actor
abused the Gumtree brand to lend legitimacy to the campaign but the site itself was not directly abused to send
the fraudulent applications.

However, we first observed this instance of Zeus Panda targeting Canadian companies in November, before the
Thanksgiving holiday. For example, on November 13, we observed malicious emails with the subject “Your
package is ready to be picked up” containing URLs linking to Microsoft Word documents such as “receiptpackage-5a0a062cae04a.doc”. The documents used macros to download Zeus Panda.

These instances of Zeus Panda include injects that feature wildcards for increased flexibility and, as noted, target
a disproportionate number of non-bank organizations. This campaign provides an example of the ongoing
evolution of banking Trojans and their uses, as well as the tendency for threat actors to built campaigns around
major events and seasonal trends.
Conclusion
Users infected with banking Trojans like Zeus Panda often do not know they are infected as the malware
conducts man-in-the-middle/browser attacks, quietly harvesting credit card numbers or banking credentials as
users visit legitimate banking and online shopping sites. While we have reported on previous examples of
banking Trojans targeting non-banking services, the timing and specific injects of these recent attacks are clearly
focused on online holiday shoppers, travelers, and holiday activities, with far more retail-related and other nonbanking injects than we normally associate with a banking Trojan attack. For consumers, keeping endpoint
protection up to date is the best defense, although few endpoint antivirus systems can currently detect the
malicious nature of this particular document. Organizations can protect users at many levels - the email gateway,
the network gateway, and the endpoint. During the holidays, when many users will be traveling or using corporate
devices from home, requiring the use of a VPN can ensure that computers are protected and banking Trojanrelated traffic can be detected and blocked whether or not a user is physically in the office.
