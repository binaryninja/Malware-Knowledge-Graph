Multiple entities reported an attempt to dramatically alter operational parameters at a water
treatment plant in Oldsmar, Florida in the United States on 08 February 2021. The intrusion
and manipulation focused on a municipally-owned treatment facility. As an item of potential
coincidence, the intrusion appears to have overlapped with the American football Super Bowl
located at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa Bay, Florida – approximately 13 miles away,
but served by a completely separate water system. Irrespective of such tangential links,
subsequent reporting from Chris Bing identified an externally-accessible Teamviewer
instance as the source of the intrusion.
Once inside the network, details are scarce but apparently the entity increased levels of
sodium hydroxide in the treatment system. Likely via interaction with a Human Machine
Interface (HMI) through the Teamviewer connection, the intruder increased sodium hydroxide
levels from 100 Parts per Million (PPM) to 11,100 PPM. Sodium hydroxide, referred to
colloquially as lye, is a caustic substance that can cause burns to soft tissues or damage to
the lungs when in aerosol form. While commonly used in water treatment operations, at such
concentrations as attempted by the entities in this incident, the substance would be harmful

to any persons coming in contact with the tainted water. Luckily, operator monitoring of the
environment caught the manipulation and mitigated the incident before any harm could
result.
Yet for all the concern and mounting hype around this issue, and despite it not resulting in
any known significant impact, multiple questions come to mind. Primary in the minds of many
would be who is responsible, although personally I am more intrigued by intent. Looking at
the incident as described in reporting and local press conferences, it appears that the
intruder authenticated to the network while it was monitored by personnel, resulting in not
only an alarm but quick action to reverse process changes which minimized impact. While
we can praise operators for reversing circumstances to prevent harm, the very fact that this
was possible presents some curious items for further analysis.
Principally, the lack of alteration to or denial of process visibility and control in this case is
curious. As seen in previous industrial-targeting incidents, from the 2015 and 2016 Ukrainian
power events to the 2017 Petro Rabigh incident, attackers needed to either remove operator
visibility and control (Ukraine) or completely evade operator attention (Petro Rabigh) to even
hope to achieve mission success. Alteration of process parameters combined with continued
visibility and operator positive control over the environment means that any changes made
through remote access can be quickly detected and reversed by engineers and staff. In the
case of the Oldsmar water treatment system, operators were not only still able to monitor the
environment, but still possessed positive control over operations to quickly catch and prevent
any significant adverse effect – a complete and abject failure for the unknown adversary.
Plotted along a continuum of Industrial Control System (ICS) attack maturity, the Oldsmar
“attack” seems both primitive and simplistic in nature. Given what limited information is
currently available about the incident, the intruder appears to have leveraged an insecure or
weakly-protected Teamviewer remote access instance to gain control over the system.
Superficially, this would appear no different from two waves of “opportunistic access” activity
against water-related systems in Israel during 2020. In these instances, intruders leveraged
insecure remote access mechanisms to gain control over several water pumping or
treatment systems. While such operations are concerning given adversary brazenness and
lack of concern, they also are incredibly unsophisticated in nature – representing a burglar
opening an unlocked door more than a thief penetrating a well-resourced security system.
While we do not know the particulars of the Oldsmar system at this time, limited evidence
and significant experience points to a situation similar to what occurred in Israel, where
insecure systems were remotely accessible and entities simply took advantage of
circumstances.
So just what the hell was the intruder thinking when they penetrated the relevant control
systems? If this was in fact a state-nexus, cyber-physical disruption operation, that actor was
both ignorant and incompetent in how to successfully manipulate and undermine an ICS
environment. In addition to failing to address operator view and control items, discussed
previously, the adversary also entered a completely outlandish value for increasing sodium
2/4

hydroxide levels – increasing the presence of this chemical by a factor of over 100. While we
cannot completely know how this would work within the impacted environment, experience
and process awareness indicate such astronomically high values would be identified,
flagged, or even mitigated by engineering controls, whether through limiting the release of
sodium hydroxide to the system to prevent overloading or triggering a shutdown in response
to widely anomalous values. If a state-directed or -sponsored entity is responsible for this
event, they should return to their dayjob of DDoS’ing websites and similar low-capability
activity, as they’ve clearly demonstrated a lack of fitness for industrial intrusions.
Alternatively, this intrusion may be the result of something more benign in nature although no
less sinister in implication. Especially given Oldsmar’s location near the stadium hosting the
American football Super Bowl, probing for remotely accessible infrastructure in the general
area would appear to be a tantalizing target for an ethically ambiguous researcher or similar
entity. While in-depth process and infrastructure analysis would show that the stadium (and
its environs) are served by a completely separate water supply, such insights are not
available to someone simply browsing Shodan for open access to critical systems. In the
course of such exploration, bringing up a logon page is a simple click from the infrastructure
scanning services’ web GUI – guessing common credentials an ethically significant but
technically minor step further, provided any authentication was present on the link at all.
While the following is pure speculation, the 11,000 PPM sodium hydroxide increase would
seem to represent a “shot in the dark” value change as opposed to any operationally savvy
actor’s adjustment of values to both maximize damage while minimizing detection. Although
such an action would represent a significant degree of callousness and depravity, such a
nice, “round” and outrageous number also implies lack of familiarity with the system in
question.
Overall, there remain many questions about this incident – but we can be fairly certain of
some observations:
1. This event is clearly not on par with past, physically disruptive ICS-targeting events
such as the Ukraine power incidents, the Petro Rabigh event, or Stuxnet.
2. Based on available information and observations, this event appears to align more with
opportunistic subversion of weakly-protected remote access mechanisms to gain entry
to the victim network.
3. Although deeply concerning, the lack of attempts to hide, mask, or otherwise obfuscate
operations within the ICS environment not only led to rapid operator intervention to
mitigate the incident, but also betrays a significant immaturity and lack of technical
understanding on the part of the adversary.
Although concerning for the simple fact that some unknown entity attempted to manipulate
the supply of a potentially noxious, corrosive chemical in a community’s water supply, the
actual details as they are known right now indicate this was hardly a sophisticated or well-

3/4

planned incident. In the absence of clarifying evidence, this incident appears more aligned
with the opportunistic intrusions into Israeli water systems than any other well-planned and
thought-out manipulation to industrial control systems for damaging effect.
However – it is worth noting that despite the lack of technical sophistication or even likely
basic understanding of the compromised network, some unknown entity still attempted this
operation. This observation on its own is deeply concerning and far more significant than the
limited technical details of the event in question. That unknown, technically immature entities
would not only access a water treatment system remotely but then interact with its controls
for chemical dispersal is highly problematic. While our “primary concerns” in critical
infrastructure defense will remain sophisticated state-sponsored entities such as Sandworm
for the foreseeable future, events such as those which took place at Oldsmar show that there
are a number of other, less mature but nonetheless quite concerning entities also probing
this space. While their efforts may be lacking or laughable depending on perspective, their
intent remains an item of immediate worry – and an item emphasizing that critical
infrastructure asset owners and operators must take these threats (even the least
competent) seriously.
