The BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team

Summary
The Gamaredon group, a misspelledanagram of "armageddon", is a Russian statesponsored cyber-espionage group that has perpetrated cyberattacks against military,
government, and non-profit organizations in Ukraine since at least 2013.
This threat actor group leverages legitimate Microsoft® Office documents to carry out
remote template injection. The technique works even with Microsoft® Word security
features enabled. This means attackers can bypass Microsoft Word macro protections to
compromise target systems with malware, gain access to information, then spread the
infection to other users.
In this blog, we’ll examine how Gamaredon operates this campaign, and share Indicators of
Compromise (IOCs), mitigation tips, and YARA rules to defend against this and similar
attacks.

Operating System

Risk & Impact

Who Is the Gamaredon Group?
As the Russian invasion of Ukraine drags on into its ninth month, the machinery of cyber
warfare also continues running covertly in the background. The Gamaradon/Armageddon
threat actor group has become very active in recent months — just open Twitter and type in
#Gamaredon, and you’ll find several tweets a week with new IoCs and samples.
Also known as Shuckworm, IRON TILDEN, Primitive Bear, WinterFlounder, and ACTINIUM,
the Gamaradon group is one of the most active advanced persistent threat (APT) groups
targeting Ukraine today. It is well-known for its phishing attacks, usually utilizing emailed
Microsoft Office document attachments to gain initial access to systems. More recently, the
group adopted the use of remote template injection in a document to gain initial access.
When executed, the malicious document downloads a self-extracting archive containing a
LNK file, which is a Windows shortcut that serves as a pointer to open a file, folder, or
application. This continues the attack chain.
Ukraine has publicly claimed that Russia is behind the Gamaradon group, which has been
active since at least 2013. This is evidenced in many reports from CERT-UA, and from other
official Ukrainian organizations over time. This timeline coincides with the beginning of the
Euromaidan protests, which happened that same year and ultimately unseated pro-Russian
Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.
The word “armageddon” was detected in the threat actor’s early campaigns; in particular, a
cyber espionage campaign seemingly devised to give Russian leadership a military
advantage by targeting the Ukrainian government, law enforcement, and military officials.
The campaign’s objective appeared to be stealing information that could provide insight into
near-term Ukrainian intentions and plans, potentially giving Russia a tactical advantage in
its physical warfare against Ukraine.

2/15

According to a sparsely-worded November 2021 report from the Security Service of Ukraine
(SSU), the group and its previous incarnations are thought to have been responsible for
over 5,000 attacks against more than 1,500 Ukrainian government systems since 2014. The
group’s goals, as noted by the SSU, included:
Control over critical infrastructure facilities (power plants; heating and water supply
systems)
The theft and collection of intelligence, including information with restricted access
(related to security and defense sector; government agencies)
Informational and psychological influence
Blocking information systems

Technical Analysis of Gamaredon Attacks
To understand how the technique of remote template injection works, we must first look
more closely at the .docx file format. With the release of Office 2007, Microsoft changed the
default file name extension of Office documents from .doc to .docx. This switch reflected the
company’s implementation of an open-source format called Open XML. The “X” on docx
refers to this. At its most basic level, it is an archive containing several XML files that make
up the document. This was a fundamental change to the way that the file’s data is stored.
Microsoft Word also allows the user to create and share new templates, which are stored in
.dotm files. Microsoft Office default templates are located in the
C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates\ folder. If you take a look in there
on your own machine, you will see the Normal.dotm template. This template is loaded every
single time Microsoft Word is opened on your computer. Template files can be loaded
locally, like Normal.dotm, or from remote sources. Loading a document from a remote
source is what makes the attack technique of template injection possible.
Remote template injection does not have to rely on the user enabling macros (a common
infection technique of the past) since no VBScript is present in the file. As soon as the user
opens the document, the altered template will load in Word and begin its full download from
the malicious URL inside the template. This technique corresponds with CVE-2017-0199.

3/15

Figure 1: Example documents with remote template injection
To begin its attacks, the Gamaredon group frequently sends phishing emails to deliver
malicious documents to users at specifically targeted organizations. As an example, if you
look at the document on the left of Figure 1 above, taken from a recent campaign, you’ll see
the header is “СЛУЖБА БЕЗПЕКИ УКРАЇНИ,” which translates to “SECURITY SERVICE
OF UKRAINE.” The second document, on the right of Figure 1, has the header “Командиру
військової частини А4267,” which means “To the commander of the military unit A4267.”
These documents were clearly crafted with the intention of targeting those who run
Ukrainian military systems.

Figure 2: Remote template download code
Since a .docx file is really just an archive, we can use the free open-source file archiver
7Zip to extract the contents and look inside. If we navigate to .\word\_rels\settings.xml.rels
in our sample, the contents of the file can be seen in Figure 2, above. The file will download
a self-extracting archive which contains a LNK file. As another example, one of the LNK
files BlackBerry recently examined was named “Запит Спеціалізованої прокуратури у

4/15

військовій та оборонній сфері Центрального регіону від 15.08.2022 року.” This
translates to “Request of the Specialized Prosecutor's Office in the Military and Defense
Sphere of the Central Region dated 15.08.2022.”

How the Gamaredon Group Maintains Persistence
Along with downloading the self-extracting archive, a new Normal.dotm template will be
created by Gamaredon to replace the original Normal.dotm template on the user’s machine.
When a document is manipulated by the user in Microsoft Word, the Normal.dotm template
is always loaded. So, in the event of a Gamaredon attack, every time a document is
opened, created, or shared from the affected system, the malicious template will be shared.
This creates persistence on the target machine, and perpetuates the infection.

5/15

Figure 3: Properties of a malicious LNK file, along with the execution command
When we right-click and open the Properties dialog of a malicious LNK file and look at the
“Target” field, we can see that a command is present. The LNK will try to execute mshta.exe
to download a PowerShell script that begins data collection on the users’ system.
Mshta.exe is a Windows-native binary designed to execute Microsoft HTML Application
(HTA) files. Once information has been collected, the PowerShell will then communicate the
data to Gamaredon’s command and control (C2) server.

Figure 4: PowerShell capturing the user’s screen and creating a web client
After the above takes place, “System.Windows.Forms” is activated to take screen captures
of the user’s system. The screenshots will be saved locally as “test.png.” The screenshots
are Base64-encoded. Additionally, the PowerShell script will transmit the user’s volume
serial number and computer name to the C2.
With the system now fully compromised and the malicious template covertly present in
Word, Gamaredon is able to continue accessing the system and serving new malicious
payloads for as long as the infection is present.

Conclusion
The existence of groups like Garmaredon makes it abundantly clear that Russian-affiliated
threat actors have continued to advance the state’s information warfare components. The
use of remote template injection has thus far proven highly effective at gaining access to
systems and achieving persistence. Even with Microsoft Word security features enabled,
remote template injection will continue to be utilized by malware authors. The technique’s
ability to bypass Microsoft Word macro protections and create persistence by replacing
standard Word templates simplifies the process of getting users systems to connect to
malicious sites and download their noxious payloads.

What Are Gamaredon’s Targets?
The primary targets of Garmaredon are users of systems based in Ukraine, spread across a
broad set of industries. Military, government, law enforcement, non-profits, and nongovernment organizations have all been targeted in the past. The long-term goal of the
6/15

Garmaredon group appears to be the exfiltration of sensitive or strategically useful
Ukrainian data.

Mitigation Tips
Sender Reputation Analysis (D3-SRA) – Never open attachments from a nontrusted source.
Software Update (D3-SU) – Keep your system’s software up-to-date to keep up with
the latest security patches.
Remote Terminal Session Detection (D3-RTSD) – Network administrators should
monitor closely for exchanges of information with unknown sources.
