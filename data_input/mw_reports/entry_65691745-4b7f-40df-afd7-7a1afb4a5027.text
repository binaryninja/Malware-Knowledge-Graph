Abstract
The Kimsuky group is a threat group that is known to have been behind the KHNP (Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power) cyber
terrorism attacks of 2014 and is still active in 2019.
Since 2018, we have been profiling and tracking spear-phishing emails and malicious code related to the Kimsuky group.
The spear-phishing emails used by the group have been determined to have the purpose of stealing web portal account
information and delivering malicious code. The main targets are government and military officials, as well as journalists.
We have analysed the changing behaviour of the Kimsuky group through ongoing tracking of the IoCs related to Kimsuky,
including simple account hijacking.
In this paper, we present the results of an analysis not only of the malware used by the Kimsuky group but also of serverside samples (tools and templates that send out spear-phishing emails, like a phishing rod) which we recently
investigated.
We have also confirmed that the C&C server used for the earlier attack continues to be used for various purposes, such
as distribution of malicious code, logging of infections, and sending phishing mail.

1. Introduction
In September 2013, Kaspersky Lab announced an APT attack targeting major Korean agencies [1]. According to the data,
the Kimsuky group was using malicious Hangul documents, like other attack groups targeting Korea, and the attack
featured remote control tools (such as Team Viewer) and communication channel configuration using webmail. In

1/24

February and March 2014, attacks that seemed to have been carried out by the same group against Korean public
institutions continued to occur [2].
In December 2014, an attempt was made to destroy PC disks by sending 5,986 spear-phishing emails to 3,571
employees of Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co., Ltd. However, only eight PCs were infected with malware, of which five
hard disks were initialized.
The malware used in this spear-phishing attack was similar in structure and operation to the malware used by the
Kimsuky group, and the Hangul word processor vulnerability used in the malware was the same as that used in the
Kimsuky malware. From these results, we inferred that the focus of the Kimsuky group was on social confusion and
monitoring of North Korean defectors and politicians, rather than acquiring money.
In June 2015, a number of web portal email accounts were hacked, sending emails with malicious Hangul document files
and phishing emails to steal portal account credentials. In January 2016, a large number of emails with malicious
attachments were sent under the guise of ‘Office of National Security at the Blue House’ to government research
institutes. Analysis by related organizations identified the malicious attachment as Kimsuky malware [3].

2. Related cases
In January 2019, an email suspected to be carrying malicious code was sent to dozens of journalists, most of whom were
covering South Korea’s ministry in charge of relations with North Korea, prompting an investigation into the incident. The
email, which was entitled ‘TF reference info’ and had a compressed file attached, was sent to more than 70 reporters,
most of whom were members of the unification ministry’s press corps. It was sent through a private email address from a
person named ‘Yoon Hong-geun’. The ministry suspected that it contained malicious code designed for hacking [4]. This
issue was known variously as Operation Cobra Venom [5], Operation Kitty Phishing [6] and Operation Kabar Cobra [7].

3. Toolset characteristics
In the process of tracking the Kimsuky group, we were able to acquire the mail-sending tools and malware used in various
spear-phishing attacks. The attack tools used by the Kimsuky group can be broadly categorized into server-side toolkits
and malware.

Server-side toolkits
Mailer (shape & core), beaconer, phisher, logger
The Kimsuky group created a mailing toolkit for attack and used it repeatedly. We found that, when constructing phishing
pages for account takeover, they reused the existing source code of the original site and specific arguments in the URL.

Malware
Dropper (malicious or camouflaged HWP documents), script, infostealer
The malware used by the Kimsuky group in recent spear-phishing attacks includes a dropper that is a malicious or
camouflaged HWP file; a malicious script, which logs and downloads additional malware to the C&C server; and an
infostealer. Some infostealers have a module that downloads additional malware.
Examples of the flow of malware used in spear-phishing attacks are shown in Figure 2.

4. Tracking malware and monitoring C&C servers
Attacker ≠ defender: OpSec failures
The attacker and defender are on different sides [8]. In addition, an attacker who continues to attack does not have a
good understanding of defence. There can be a difference between an attacking position and a defending position.
After all, attackers are also in the position of developing malware and server-side toolkits.
Attackers who develop various attack tools are in the same position as those in general development. While working
within a limited timeframe and with limited resources, information leakage and vulnerabilities can occur naturally due to
code reuse or C&C server operation mistakes.
In the course of investigating and analysing the C&C server, several security weaknesses were discovered, which
provided us with good information for investigation and tracking. We will look at the following cases of OpSec failure:
1. Directory listing
2. Leaked FTP access information
3. File download vulnerability

Following the DOKKAEBI campaign, malicious Hangul documents were continuously analysed [9]. During this process,
we tracked a C&C server (suppcrt-seourity[.]esy.es) and malware related to malicious Hangul documents.
The file name of the malicious Hangul sample uploaded to VirusTotal on 23 May 2018 (shown in Figure 4) is ‘종전선
언.hwp’ (‘Declaration of war end’) [10].

Table 3: Malware.
The malware fontchk.jse records the infection information (date, time, IP address, MAC address, etc.) in the path
[C&C]/update/fonts/log.txt, as shown in Figure 6. In this way, the files (including the malware) and log files that exist on
the C&C server can easily be obtained.

Figure 6:

Fontchk.jse records the infection information in the path [C&C]/update/fonts/log.txt.
Since a lot of resources are required to build and verify (check the actual operation of) the C&C servers used by
attackers, we monitor them continuously, based on the assumption that they are likely to be recycled (reused) rather than
being used once and then destroyed.
A new log was recorded on the C&C server on 2018-07-10 (D+49), leading us to conduct further investigation and
analysis.

Figure 7: New infection log.
The C&C server leaked its directory listing and didn’t have proper access control, so it was possible to check the
remaining logs following an infection.

Figure 8: MAC address look-up [12].
Previously, we analysed C&C servers, and we saw that the MAC address is used as the directory path. Using this
information, we were able to obtain additional malware by using the MAC address written in the infection log.

Additional malware download (C&C: primaryhelp[.]esy.es)

Table 6: Malware.
At the time of analysing the malware, additional malware was downloaded from the C&C server.

11/24

Figure 16: Additional malware being downloaded from the C&C server.
As in the previous case, we continued to monitor the server, based on the assumption that the attacker would reuse the
C&C server they had built.
As a result of our continued monitoring, we confirmed that a new file was uploaded to the C&C server on 2019-04-01
(D+42) and conducted further investigation and analysis.

Figure 17: Mailer (shape): mail.php.

The C&C server (primary-help[.]esy.es) is also a directory listing as shown in Figure 8.
We checked that the new files, mail.php and mail_ok.php, were uploaded to the C&C server.

Figure 18: The new files were uploaded to the C&C server.

We confirmed that these files are tools for sending mail (i.e. mailers).
If we enter the sender and receiver information (name/email), title and contents and select ‘COMMIT’, then we can
confirm that mail.php is a mailer – the actual operation is performed by mail_ok.php.

12/24

Figure 19: Mail.php is a mailer. The actual operation is performed by mail_ok.php.
When using the mailer, the mail was indeed sent the normal way, but with new malware attached.

and new malware was attached.
In addition, we confirmed that the web beacon was applied to check whether the mail was read, using reading.php
defined in the <img> tag in the mail sent by the mailer.

Among infostealers used by the Kimsuky group, some samples have been found that use FTP to download additional
malware after logging infected targets to the C&C [14, 15].
The malware uses the Hostinger free hosting service as a C&C server, and there is a security weakness in that the
account (u428325809 ) and password ([email protected]#) used for FTP communication are exposed in plain text.

Relationships analysis
In the process of tracking the Kimsuky group attack, we analysed the relationships of a large quantity of data, and
investigated C&C servers located in South Korea through an investigation agency. Figure 29 show the associations that
were found between the toolsets and C&C servers classified in our research.

Figure 29: Relationships between C&C servers and toolsets.
Some of the results of analysing the relationships between toolsets and C&C servers used by the Kimsuky group in
spear-phishing attacks are as follows.

ddlovke[.]kr (KR) → military[.]co.kr (KR) ← suppcrt-seourity[.]esy.es(HOSTINGER)
Figure 30 shows a graphical representation of the relationships.

21/24

Figure 30: Graphical representation of the Kimsuky relationships.
Through its reuse of resources, we were able to track the attack performed by the Kimsuky group.

Conclusion
Due to the particular circumstances of South Korea, the Kimsuky group continuously conducts malicious acts by abusing
(or camouflaging) documents created in Hangul and phishing for email account credentials in order to hijack accounts.
Similar attacks have continued.
However, in the process of tracking the Kimsuky group, we have obtained various pieces of important information through
cases of OpSec failure on the part of the attackers.
The information obtained in this way can be used to infer to what extent the next attack will proceed, and, if such a new
spear-phishing attack occurs, the appropriate proactive response can be taken by analysing correlations with various
indicators found in previous attacks.
We will continue to strive to prevent the future spread of spear-phishing attacks by the Kimsuky group, and we hope that
this paper will help in responding to threats in many areas including domestic.
