INTRODUCTION
In the past several years, a flood of vulnerabilities
has hit industrial control systems (ICS) — the
technological backbone of electric grids, water
supplies and production lines. These vulnerabilities
affect the reliable operation of sensors, programmable
controllers, software and networking equipment used
to automate and monitor the physical processes that
keep our modern world running.
Since 2000, FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence has
identified nearly 1,600 publicly disclosed ICS
vulnerabilities. Many of these are unpatched
— and some are simply unpatchable due to
outdated technology —providing open paths
for adversarial exploitation. Nation-state cyber
threat actors have exploited five of these
vulnerabilities in attacks since 2009.

Unfortunately, security personnel from
manufacturing, energy, water and other
industries are frequently unaware of their
own control system assets, let alone the
vulnerabilities that affect them. Organizations
operating these systems are missing
the warnings and leaving their industrial
environments exposed.
This report highlights trends in total ICS
vulnerability disclosures, patch availability,
vulnerable device type and vulnerabilities
exploited in the wild.

SPECIAL REPORT / 2016 ICS VULNERABILITY TREND REPORT

KEY JUDGMENTS
The discovery of Stuxnet in 2010 drove interest in industrial control systems (ICS)
vulnerability research. FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence counted just 149 ICS vulnerability disclosures
that were made between January 2000 and December 2010. Through April 2016, we have
counted 1,552. We anticipate this upward trend will continue.

58%

Most (58%) of the 801 ICS-specific vulnerability disclosures since February 2013 dealt
with Level 2 (L2) in the simplified Purdue ICS architecture model, which describes how
manufacturing devices interface with computers. We surmise that this is because L2
software is easier to obtain than L1 devices and is more familiar to a greater number
of vulnerability researchers. However, adversary access to L2 alone is generally sufficient
for at-will interaction with the controlled process.

Vulnerability patching presents a significant challenge. Of the 1,552 total vulnerability
disclosures we examined, 516 (33%) had no vendor fixes. The lack of vendor fixes and
slow patch times for most industrial environments presents a significant opportunity
for potential adversaries.

Through April 2016, at least five ICS-specific vulnerabilities have been exploited in the wild,
a rate we anticipate will increase in the future.

In light of these observations and trends, we recommend that ICS asset owners:
• Prepare their security teams with an accurate understanding of control system assets, their
locations, and functions.
• Obtain structured vulnerability and patch feeds that cover a wide variety of sources.
• Match the vulnerability disclosures and patch announcements against their asset inventory.
• Track vulnerable and unpatched products currently used in their industrial environments.
• Prioritize vulnerability remediation efforts by considering ICS architecture location, simplicity
of exploitation and possible impact on the controlled industrial process.

METHODOLOGY
For the purpose of this report, ICS-specific vulnerability
disclosures consist of a vulnerability announcement
where 1) a disclosing party specifically examined
products intended to aid in the operation of an industrial
process, and 2) exploitation of the vulnerability has a
distinct impact on the controlled industrial process.

• We do not count a disclosure unless it names
a specific product.
• We exclude general purpose operating systems,
such as Microsoft Windows, even though human
machine interfaces (HMIs), engineering laptops and
supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
servers commonly use them. We also exclude database
applications, such as Oracle and SQL Server, even
though control system applications and historians
commonly incorporate them. Parties disclosing
vulnerabilities in these products have not generally
done so with ICS in mind.
• By the same reasoning, we excluded major
third-party software vulnerabilities/attacks, including
POODLE, Heartbleed, and Shellshock, though a variety
of ICS-specific software exhibits these issues.
• Further, if a researcher discloses a vulnerability that
affects multiple products that have different uses
in an industrial environment, and those uses lead to
differing impacts on the controlled process, we count
them separately. For example, if a researcher discloses
a vulnerability in an OPC server (a type of process
controller) library the vendor bundles into both a
historian and an engineering workstation,
we count this as two disclosures because successful
exploitation can lead to distinct process impacts.
• Additionally, we have not independently confirmed
the accuracy of the disclosures or the efficacy of
associated patches.

ICS-SPECIFIC
VULNERABILITY
DISCLOSURES
OVER TIME

AVERAGE YEARLY DISCLOSURES LIKELY TO
INCREASE, BUT NOT AT 2015 RATE
We identify another sharp increase from 2014 to 2015—
when disclosures rose from 249 to 371, or by 49%. Prior to
this (from 2011 to 2014), disclosures rose an average of just
4.7% annually.

STUXNET DROVE INTEREST IN ICS-SPECIFIC
VULNERABILITIES
An examination of 1,490 ICS-specific vulnerability
disclosures between 2000 and 2015 (see Figure 1) shows
a sharp increase in 2011. We believe the media attention
garnered by Stuxnet is the principal driver of the increase:
• Stuxnet was the first publicly recognized attack to exploit
vulnerabilities in ICS products.1 Media coverage began in
mid-2010 and continued for the next 18 months.
• There was a general slow upward trend prior to 2010,
which itself saw just 55 ICS vulnerability disclosures.
• 2011 included 219 ICS vulnerability disclosures,
representing a 300% growth from 2010.
• Most (90%) of the vulnerabilities came after 2010, though
that accounts for only one-third of the timeline.
• While the Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency
Response Team (ICS-CERT), which coordinates
vulnerability disclosures between researchers and vendors,
formally launched in November 2009, may have had
some effect on disclosure rates, we consider that effect
secondary because CERT/CC effectively coordinated ICSspecific vulnerability disclosures before that date.

We anticipate that the average number of ICS-specific
vulnerability disclosures will increase during the next
several years at about the rate it did from 2011 to 2014
(5%) rather than the rate in 2015 (49%).
We surmise that the 2015 increase represents an
anomalous spike rather than a new threshold because 92
of the vulnerabilities were caused by two large groups of
disclosures that vendors released at a single time: 56 from
OSIsoft and 36 from Yokogawa. 2,3
• The size of these vendor releases are anomalous in the
data set. The next largest group of disclosures by a
vendor was 12 in 2014.
• Releasing a set of vulnerabilities — versus one-by-one
as they are likely discovered — indicates that the vendor
may be choosing to address them all at once rather than
serially. Vendors may believe that a group and disclose
approach enhances marketing of new releases, but we
have yet to determine whether this approach is a trend.
• We suggest the Yokogawa vulnerabilities may have
been discovered simultaneously because they dealt with
similar buffer overflows, but affected multiple products.

VULNERABILITIES BY ICS LEVEL
FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence classifies ICS vulnerabilities
by their location on a simplified Purdue ICS architectural
model.4 The model (as shown in Figure 2) identifies six
levels based on the device’s functions and location on the
network. We classify industrial networking equipment
(normally hardened to withstand harsh temperatures,
vibration and dust) in another category.

MOST DISCLOSURES AFFECT LEVEL 2
PROBABLY BECAUSE OF RESEARCHER’S
FAMILIARITY WITH THE SYSTEMS AND THE
PRODUCT’S AVAILABILITY
About half (465 of the 801 vulnerability disclosures from
February 2013 to April 2016) affect products at ICS
architecture Level 2 (as shown in Figure 3). We believe
Level 2 has received the most attention because:
• Equipment in this level frequently relies on operating
systems, databases, and other information technologies
already familiar to vulnerability researchers; and
• Technologies used at this level can be easily
and inexpensively obtained by vulnerability
researchers, such as limited-time, full-featured
demonstration versions.

ACCESS TO LEVEL 2 ALLOWS
A THREAT ACTOR TO MANIPULATE
PROCESSES
Once an attacker has unrestricted access to
Level 2, further exploits and vulnerabilities
become less important because:
• Devices that directly control the processes, such as HMI
and engineering workstations, reside here. Like having
a master key, controlling one of those devices gives
attackers control of any connected processes.
For example, as seen in the attacks on the Ukrainian
power companies in December 2014, once attackers
have access to the HMI, they can open and close
switches and actuators at will without exploiting
additional vulnerabilities.
• Using unauthenticated protocols allows any computer
connected to these networks to interact with
the controlled process. For instance, the use
of Modbus/TCP allows any device on the network
to alter a set point within the process logic
executed by the controller.

ARE ZERO DAYS,
A TREND LIKELY

Of the 1,552 total vulnerabilities we examined, 516 did
not have a fix available at the time of public disclosure
(as shown in Figure 4). This means that 33% were zeroday vulnerabilities. While early indications for 2016
appear to depart from this number, we doubt this
percentage will change significantly in the near future.
Figure 4 shows ICS-specific vulnerabilities between
January 2010 and April 2016 with a fix available at
the time of release and illustrates that the portion of
disclosures without a fix has remained fairly constant
after 2010. We think several factors may be contributing
to the lack of patches:
• Researchers did not disclose the vulnerability to the
vendor prior to releasing information about it publicly
• Vendors did not respond to researcher in a timely way,
prompting the researcher to disclose
• Vulnerabilities could not be (easily) fixed
• Vendors consider vulnerable device end-of-life

ICS VULNERABILITIES
EXPLOITED IN THE WILD
While ICS vulnerability disclosures were influenced by Stuxnet, we have not observed a corresponding
increase in ICS vulnerability exploitation. We are aware of five ICS-specific vulnerabilities exploited in the
wild (as shown in Figure 5). In addition, given the growth in researcher interest, we surmise that many
other ICS-specific vulnerabilities have been exploited in the past, but have not been made public.

EXPLOITATION OF ICS-SPECIFIC
VULNERABILITIES TO ACCRUE
AT SLOW RATE

SANDWORM TEAM UNDERMINES THREE
UKRAINIAN ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTORS
IN LATE 2015

We note that all five instances in which ICS-specific
vulnerabilities were exploited can be reasonably tied
to nation-state actors. Four of the five — Stuxnet
and the attacks in Ukraine — can be tied to direct
geopolitical objectives. The success of these incidents
in compromising key systems to achieve a political
objective or demonstrating an adversary’s capabilities
makes us expect that nation-state adversaries will
increasingly exploit ICS-specific vulnerabilities.

On Dec. 23, 2015, three Ukrainian electricity distributors
found themselves at ground zero for ICS security. A cyber
threat group — that we strongly believe is the suspected
Russia-based Sandworm Team — had invaded systems
and triggered power outages across three regions in
western Ukraine.
The attackers systemically shut down the flow of
electricity by manipulating distribution system dispatcher
HMIs — the applications that grid operators use to
control the flow of power to homes and businesses.
After shutting down the power, attackers exploited two
previously unknown vulnerabilities in control systems
networking gear to inhibit the utilities’ ability to restore
power and maintain control of the grid.

OUTLOOK

RECOMMENDATIONS

In summary, our research supports the following
expectations:

The flood of vulnerabilities is likely to overwhelm
ICS asset owners as they struggle to keep up with
vulnerability notifications, assess associated risk, and
implement mitigation. To ensure effectiveness and
efficiency in dealing with ICS vulnerabilities, FireEye
recommends that ICS asset owners:

• ICS vulnerability disclosures will continue to rise during
the coming years at an average close to 5%, with
occasional spikes or drops.
• Media coverage of significant events in ICS security,
either attacks or research, will likely continue to fuel
the vulnerability disclosure rate.
• The majority of disclosures will consist of vulnerabilities
affecting Level 2 of the simplified Purdue model.
• While ICS-specific vulnerabilities may not be required
to access, manipulate or impact industrial processes,
reports of ICS-specific vulnerabilities exploited in the
wild will slowly accrue.

• Prepare their security teams with an accurate
understanding of control system assets, their locations,
and functions.
• Obtain structured vulnerability and patch feeds that cover
a wide variety of sources.
• Match the vulnerability disclosures and patch
announcements against their asset inventory.
• Track vulnerable and unpatched products currently used
in their industrial environments.
• Prioritize vulnerability remediation efforts by considering
ICS architecture location, simplicity of exploitation, and
possible impact on the controlled industrial process.
