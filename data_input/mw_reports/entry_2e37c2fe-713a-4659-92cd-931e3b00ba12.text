Hungary’s far-right government suspected of hacking phones of investigative journalists and
targeting owners
Viktor Orbán’s government has deployed a new weapon in its war on the media in Hungary,
according to forensic analysis of several mobile devices, using some of the world’s most
invasive spyware against investigative journalists and the circle of one of the country’s last
remaining independent media owners.

The Pegasus project, a collaborative investigation run by the French nonprofit journalism
organisation Forbidden Stories, has reviewed leaked records that suggest a wide range of
people in Hungary were selected as potential targets before a possible hacking attempt with
the sophisticated Pegasus spyware, sold by the Israeli company NSO Group. In a number of
cases, forensic analysis confirmed devices had been infected with Pegasus.
The leaked data includes the phone numbers of people who appear to be targets of
legitimate national security or criminal investigations.

What is in the data leak?
The data leak is a list of more than 50,000 phone numbers that, since 2016, are believed to
have been selected as those of people of interest by government clients of NSO Group,
which sells surveillance software. The data also contains the time and date that numbers
were selected, or entered on to a system. Forbidden Stories, a Paris-based nonprofit
journalism organisation, and Amnesty International initially had access to the list and shared
access with 16 media organisations including the Guardian. More than 80 journalists have
worked together over several months as part of the Pegasus project. Amnesty’s Security
Lab, a technical partner on the project, did the forensic analyses.
What does the leak indicate?
The consortium believes the data indicates the potential targets NSO’s government clients
identified in advance of possible surveillance. While the data is an indication of intent, the
presence of a number in the data does not reveal whether there was an attempt to infect the
phone with spyware such as Pegasus, the company’s signature surveillance tool, or whether
any attempt succeeded. The presence in the data of a very small number of landlines and
US numbers, which NSO says are “technically impossible” to access with its tools, reveals
some targets were selected by NSO clients even though they could not be infected with
Pegasus. However, forensic examinations of a small sample of mobile phones with numbers
on the list found tight correlations between the time and date of a number in the data and the
start of Pegasus activity – in some cases as little as a few seconds.
What did forensic analysis reveal?
Amnesty examined 67 smartphones where attacks were suspected. Of those, 23 were
successfully infected and 14 showed signs of attempted penetration. For the remaining 30,
the tests were inconclusive, in several cases because the handsets had been replaced.
Fifteen of the phones were Android devices, none of which showed evidence of successful

2/13

infection. However, unlike iPhones, phones that use Android do not log the kinds of
information required for Amnesty’s detective work. Three Android phones showed signs of
targeting, such as Pegasus-linked SMS messages.
Amnesty shared “backup copies” of four iPhones with Citizen Lab, a research group at the
University of Toronto that specialises in studying Pegasus, which confirmed that they showed
signs of Pegasus infection. Citizen Lab also conducted a peer review of Amnesty’s forensic
methods, and found them to be sound.
Which NSO clients were selecting numbers?
While the data is organised into clusters, indicative of individual NSO clients, it does not say
which NSO client was responsible for selecting any given number. NSO claims to sell its
tools to 60 clients in 40 countries, but refuses to identify them. By closely examining the
pattern of targeting by individual clients in the leaked data, media partners were able to
identify 10 governments believed to be responsible for selecting the targets: Azerbaijan,
Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Hungary, India, and the
United Arab Emirates. Citizen Lab has also found evidence of all 10 being clients of NSO.
What does NSO Group say?
You can read NSO Group’s full statement here. The company has always said it does not
have access to the data of its customers’ targets. Through its lawyers, NSO said the
consortium had made “incorrect assumptions” about which clients use the company’s
technology. It said the 50,000 number was “exaggerated” and that the list could not be a list
of numbers “targeted by governments using Pegasus”. The lawyers said NSO had reason to
believe the list accessed by the consortium “is not a list of numbers targeted by governments
using Pegasus, but instead, may be part of a larger list of numbers that might have been
used by NSO Group customers for other purposes”. They said it was a list of numbers that
anyone could search on an open source system. After further questions, the lawyers said the
consortium was basing its findings “on misleading interpretation of leaked data from
accessible and overt basic information, such as HLR Lookup services, which have no
bearing on the list of the customers' targets of Pegasus or any other NSO products ... we still
do not see any correlation of these lists to anything related to use of NSO Group
technologies”. Following publication, they explained that they considered a "target" to be a
phone that was the subject of a successful or attempted (but failed) infection by Pegasus,
and reiterated that the list of 50,000 phones was too large for it to represent "targets" of
Pegasus. They said that the fact that a number appeared on the list was in no way indicative
of whether it had been selected for surveillance using Pegasus.
What is HLR lookup data?

3/13

The term HLR, or home location register, refers to a database that is essential to operating
mobile phone networks. Such registers keep records on the networks of phone users and
their general locations, along with other identifying information that is used routinely in
routing calls and texts. Telecoms and surveillance experts say HLR data can sometimes be
used in the early phase of a surveillance attempt, when identifying whether it is possible to
connect to a phone. The consortium understands NSO clients have the capability through an
interface on the Pegasus system to conduct HLR lookup inquiries. It is unclear whether
Pegasus operators are required to conduct HRL lookup inquiries via its interface to use
its software; an NSO source stressed its clients may have different reasons – unrelated to
Pegasus – for conducting HLR lookups via an NSO system.
However, the records also include the numbers of at least 10 lawyers, an opposition
politician and at least five journalists.
The phones of two journalists at the Hungarian Pegasus project partner, the investigative
outlet Direkt36, were successfully infected with the spyware, including Szabolcs Panyi, a
well-known reporter with a wide range of sources in diplomatic and national security circles.
Forensic analysis of his device by Amnesty International stated conclusively it had been
repeatedly compromised by Pegasus during a seven-month period in 2019, with the infection
often coming soon after comment requests made by Panyi to Hungarian government
officials.

Pegasus enables the attacker to view all content on a phone, including messages from apps
with end-to-end encryption, photographs and GPS location data. It can also turn the device
into an audio or video recorder. NSO has claimed the spyware is only meant for use against
serious criminals and terrorists.
Panyi thinks some in the Orbán government believe independent journalists are part of a
conspiracy against them. “I think there’s widespread paranoia and they see much more in
our motives and our networks than there actually is,” he said.
“We are not aware of any alleged data collection claimed by the request,” said a Hungarian
government spokesperson in response to detailed questions about the targeting of Panyi and
others.
NSO Group said it “does not have access to the data of its customers’ targets”, cast doubt on
the significance of the leaked data and said it would “continue to investigate all credible
claims of misuse and take appropriate action”.
Previously, Orbán’s spokesperson Zoltán Kovács has publicly attacked Panyi, accusing him
of “Orbánophobia and Hungarophobia” and describing him as “deep into political activism”.
Since Orbán became prime minister in 2010, Hungary has fallen from 23rd to 92nd in the
World Press Freedom Index. Earlier this month, Reporters Without Borders put Orbán on its
Enemies of Press Freedom list, the first time an EU leader has featured.

There have been almost no cases of physical violence against journalists in Hungary;
instead, Orbán’s war of attrition against the media has used different means. These have
included harassment of independent journalists, pressure on media owners, withdrawing
state advertising funds from critical titles and aggressive takeovers by government-friendly
figures.

Orbán’s covert war against the media
When his forensics report came through, Panyi sat down in Direkt36’s Budapest newsroom,
a modest suite of offices inside a grand building one block from the Danube, and sketched
out a chart in blue pen.
On the left-hand side: dates on which he sent official requests for comment to the Hungarian
government. On the right: dates on which forensic analysis shows his phone was
compromised by Pegasus.
The correlation was hard to ignore. On 3 April 2019, for example, Panyi sent a request for
comment to several government departments in relation to a story he was working on about
a Russian bank that was relocating to Budapest despite concerns it could be a front for
Russian intelligence. One day later, Panyi’s phone was infected with Pegasus.
There were 11 occasions when a Pegasus infection was confirmed within a few days of a
comment request from Panyi to the government, according to Amnesty’s analysis.
More than half the comment requests he sent to various government offices during a sevenmonth period were followed up with an attack. The tactic, he assumes, was for the
government to get ahead of the story, work out what he was planning to publish and attempt
to identify his sources.
Analysis carried out on the phone of one of Panyi’s colleagues at Direkt36, András Szabó,
also returned positive results. Direkt36 is one of just a few remaining Hungarian outlets not
under some kind of governmental control or influence.

Other Hungarians selected for potential targeting include a photographer who worked as a
fixer for a visiting foreign journalist, and a well-known investigative journalist, who declined to
have forensic analysis done or to be named, citing a fear of losing sources.
Another Hungarian journalist selected as a candidate for possible surveillance was Dávid
Dercsényi, who edits a newspaper put out by the authority of Budapest’s opposition-run
eighth district and previously worked for five years for the website of the independent outlet
HVG.
Three numbers linked to Dercsényi, including one belonging to his ex-wife that had been
registered in his name, were found in the data.

He expressed puzzlementhis name was in the data. “Mostly I was working on average, notvery-sensitive topics,” he said. He suspects a request for comment sent to the government
over a story about the trial of a former Islamic State operative could have drawn attention. He
was no longer in possession of any of the three phones appearing in the data, so analysis
was not possible.

The decline of the major online news site Index last year, under pressure from a governmentlinked businessman, left 24.hu, owned by the wealthy investor Zoltán Varga, as the biggest
independent news site in the country.
Varga has long been in Orbán’s crosshairs. In an interview on the terrace of his grand villa in
the Buda Hills, he described receiving both enticements and threats from government-linked
businesspeople to sell 24.hu and the rest of his sizeable media portfolio, which includes the
country’s bestselling women’s magazine. On one occasion, he claims, he was told he would
receive generous state advertising subsidies if he made editorial staffing changes.

“They think everything is about money. But I already have money … Slowly I turned into an
enemy,” he said.
He began to notice men in parkedcars outside his home and unwanted eavesdroppers on his
business meetings in restaurants. He said sometimes in the middle of a phone call, he would
hear a recording of the call played back, from the beginning.On one occasion, a black

helicopter hovered above his house and made three incursions into his garden – an
intimidation tactic, he believes. Varga has round-the-clock security at his home and has long
been wary of speaking on the phone.

He was right to be worried. A few weeks after Orbán won a third consecutive term as prime
minister in spring 2018, Varga invited six friends to dinner. Among them was Attila Chikán, a
minister in Orbán’s first government in the late 1990s, who has since become a staunch critic
of the prime minister. The others were wealthy and well-connected businessmen.
Over wine and finger food on Varga’s expansive terrace, the men discussed creating a new
foundation that among other things would investigate and expose corruption among
Hungary’s ruling elite. “It was a friendly conversation, it wasn’t a coup,” said Varga.
Two weeks later he met a government-linked acquaintance for coffee and she
demonstratively referenced the dinner, suggesting such meetings could be “dangerous” for
him. Varga suspected Orbán’s circle had somehow put the meeting under surveillance.
Indeed, the records show all seven people at the dinner were selected as potential
candidates for surveillance. Forensic analysis carried out on the handset of one of those
present showed clear evidence of a confirmed infection at the time of the dinner. The phone
of another participant showed signs of Pegasus activity but not of compromise.
Q&A
What is the Pegasus project?
Show
The Pegasus project is a collaborative journalistic investigation into the NSO Group and its
clients. The company sells surveillance technology to governments worldwide. Its flagship
product is Pegasus, spying software – or spyware – that targets iPhones and Android
devices. Once a phone is infected, a Pegasus operator can secretly extract chats, photos,
emails and location data, or activate microphones and cameras without a user knowing.
Forbidden Stories, a Paris-based nonprofit journalism organisation, and Amnesty
International had access to a leak of more than 50,000 phone numbers selected as targets
by clients of NSO since 2016. Access to the data was then shared with the Guardian and 16
other news organisations, including the Washington Post, Le Monde, Die Zeit and
Süddeutsche Zeitung. More than 80 journalists have worked collaboratively over several
months on the investigation, which was coordinated by Forbidden Stories.
One of those present expressed surprise the meeting had attracted such attention. “It was a
typical Hungarian discussion. We sat down, everybody said: ‘Fuck, the situation is really
bad,’ but then it did not lead anywhere,” he said.
Along with Varga’s circle, the son and lawyer of the oligarch Lajos Simicska, Orbán’s
childhood friend turned enemy, also appear to have been candidates for surveillance around
the time that Simicska was pressured into selling his critical media holdings to governmentfriendly figures in 2018.

Ajtony Csaba Nagy, Simicska’s lawyer, recalled noticing strange sounds or replayed
conversations during phone calls in 2018. “It also happened that some information appeared
in the press that we only discussed on the phone, nowhere else,” he told Direkt36.

Hungary, Israel and Pegasus
A former NSO employee confirmed Hungary was among the company’s clients. It apparently
acquired Pegasus in the aftermath of a 2017 visit to the country by the then Israeli prime
minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, a close Orbán ally. NSO has denied it takes any direction
from the Israeli government when choosing its customers.

In response to detailed allegations about Hungary’s acquisition and use of Pegasus, a
Hungariangovernment spokesperson said: “Hungary is a democratic state governed by the
rule of law, and as such, when it comes to any individual it has always acted and continues
to act in accordance with the law in force. In Hungary, state bodies authorised to use covert
instruments are regularly monitored by governmental and non-governmental institutions.”

10/13

Hungary has one of the loosest legislative frameworks in Europe for the authorisation of
surveillance. There is no judicial oversight if the request is made for national security
reasons; only the signature of the minister of justice is required.
Information released to the Hungarian outlet 168 Óra under a freedom of information request
showed the justice minister, Judit Varga, approved 1,285 surveillance requests in 2020,
which includes all forms of surveillance, not just Pegasus.
In an earlier interview with a Pegasus project partner, Varga said it was a “provocation” to
ask whether she would authorise surveillance of a journalist, but said “there are so many
dangers to the state everywhere” when asked why she had approved so many requests. The
justice ministry did not respond to detailed allegations about Hungary’s use of Pegasus.
The government communications office, when presented with the same allegations, replied
with questions of its own: “Have you asked the same questions of the governments of the
United States of America, the United Kingdom, Germany or France? In the case you have,
how long did it take for them to reply and how did they respond? Was there any intelligence
service to help you formulate the questions?”
Orbán has built his political platform on staunchly opposing migration and claiming Hungary
is under attack from a network directed by the Hungarian-American financier and
philanthropist George Soros.
The leaked data reveals at least one case in which Pegasus appears to have been used in
the hope of uncovering – or inventing – a “Soros conspiracy”.
One of the numbers in the data belonged to Adrien Beauduin, a Belgian-Canadian PhD
student.

On paper, he was the perfect “villain” for the Orbán government: a gender studies student at
Central European University (CEU), an institution founded by Soros. At the time, the
government was in the process both of ending the teaching of gender studies in Hungary
and of forcing CEU out of the country.
Beauduin was arrested at a protest in Budapest in December 2018 and charged with
assaulting police officers, which carries a sentence of up to eight years in prison. He denies
he was in any way violent towards police.
Beauduin’s lawyer, Kata Nehéz-Posony, said there was “no real evidence” against him
except for police testimony that was copied word for word from the case of another person
arrested.
She said she suspected the arrest was “highly politically motivated”. On 14 December, a few
days after the arrest, the then communications chief of Orbán’s Fidesz party publicly noted
that “the pro-immigration Soros network is organising violent demonstrations in Budapest”.
Analysis of Beauduin’s phone showed Pegasus activity on the device shortly after this,
though no sign of successful infection. Eventually, the most serious charges against him
were dropped, suggesting nothing incriminating was found.

12/13

A former senior Hungarian counter-intelligence officer who left the service in the early part of
the last decade admitted there was a flexible approach to concocting national security
reasons for surveillance during his time. “[But] there were two professions we kept our
distance from: lawyers and journalists,” he said.
The leaked records, and the analysis of infected devices, suggest that in Orbán’s Hungary
today, this is no longer the case.
