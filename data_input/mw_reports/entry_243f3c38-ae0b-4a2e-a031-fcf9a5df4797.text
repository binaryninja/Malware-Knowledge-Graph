Scammers are very quick at reacting to current events, so they can generate ill-gotten gains.
It comes as no surprise that they exploited the current events in Ukraine, and when the
Ukrainian Twitter account tweeted Bitcoin and Ethereum wallet addresses for donations we
knew that scammers would use this as a lure for their victims.

This blog covers some of the malicious sites and emails McAfee has observed in the past
few weeks.

Crypto wallet donation scams
A crypto donation scam occurs when perpetrators create phishing websites and emails that
contain cryptocurrency wallets asking for donations. We have observed several new domains
being created which perform this malicious activity, such as ukrainehelp[.]world and
ukrainethereum[.]com.
Ukrainhelp[.]world
Below is a screenshot of Ukrainehelp[.]world, which is a phishing site asking for crypto
donations for UNICEF. The website contains the BBC logo and several crypto wallet
addresses.

While investigating this site, we observed that the Ethereum wallet used use was also
associated with an older crypto scam site called eth-event20.com. The image below shows
the current value of the crypto wallet which is worth $114,000. Interestingly this wallet
transfers all its coins to 0xc95eb2aa75260781627e7171c679a490e2240070 which in turn
transfers to 0x45fb09468b17d14d2b9952bc9dcb39ee7359e64d. The final wallet currently
has 313 ETH which is worth over $850,000. This shows the large sums of money scammers
can generate with phishing sites.

Ukrainethereum[.]com
Ukrainethereum[.]com is another crypto scam site, but what makes this one interesting is the
features it contains to gain the victim’s confidence in trusting the website such as a fake
chatbox and a fake donation verifier.

Fake Chat

4/13

The image above shows the chatbox on the left-hand side which displays several messages.
At first glance, it would appear as if other users are on the website and talking, but when you
reload the site it shows the same messages. This is due to the chat messages being
displayed from a list that is used to populate the website with JavaScript code as shown on
the right-hand side.
Fake Donation Verifier
The site contains a donation checker so the victim can see if their donation was received, as
shown below.

5/13

1. The first image on left shows the verification box for donation to check if it is completed
or not
2. Upon clicking ‘Check’ the victim is shown a message to say the donation was
received.
3. What occurs, is upon clicking ‘Check’ the JavaScript code changes the website code
so that it displays the ‘Thanks!’ message, and no actual check is performed.
Phishing Email
The following image shows one of the examples of phish emails we have observed.

The email is not addressed to anyone specifically as they are mass-mailed to multiple email
addresses. The wallet IDs in the email are not associated with the official Ukraine Twitter and
are owned by scammers. As you can see in the image above, they are similar as the first 3
characters are the same. This could lead to some users believing it is legitimate. Therefore,
it’s important to check that the wallet address is identical.
Credit Card Information Stealer
This is the most common type of phishing website. The goal of these sites it entices the
victim into entering their credit card and personally identifiable information (PII) data by
making them believe that the site being visited is official. This section contains details on one
such website we have found using Ukraine donations as a lure.
Razonforukrain[.]com
The image below shows the phishing site. The website was used to save the children’s NGO
links and images, which made it appear more genuine. You can see that is it asking the
victim to enter their credit card and billing information.

6/13

Once the data is entered, and the victim clicks on ‘Donate’, the information will be submitted
via the form and will be sent to scammers so they can then use or sell the information.
We observed that a few days after the website was created, the scammers change the site
code so that it became a Mcdonald’s phishing site targeting the Arab Emirates. This was a
surprising change in tactics.

The heatmap below shows the detections McAfee has observed around the world for the
malicious sites mentioned in this blog.
