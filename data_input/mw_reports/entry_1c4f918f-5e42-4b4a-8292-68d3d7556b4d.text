New campaign targeting security researchers

Threat Analysis Group

Over the past several months, the Threat Analysis Group has identified an ongoing campaign targeting security researchers
working on vulnerability research and development at different companies and organizations. The actors behind this
campaign, which we attribute to a government-backed entity based in North Korea, have employed a number of means to
target researchers which we will outline below. We hope this post will remind those in the security research community that
they are targets to government-backed attackers and should remain vigilant when engaging with individuals they have not
previously interacted with.

In order to build credibility and connect with security researchers, the actors established a research blog and multiple Twitter
profiles to interact with potential targets. They've used these Twitter profiles for posting links to their blog, posting videos of
their claimed exploits and for amplifying and retweeting posts from other accounts that they control.

Actor controlled Twitter profiles.
Their blog contains write-ups and analysis of vulnerabilities that have been publicly disclosed, including “guest” posts from
unwitting legitimate security researchers, likely in an attempt to build additional credibility with other security researchers.

Example of an analysis done by the actor about a publicly disclosed vulnerability.
While we are unable to verify the authenticity or the working status of all of the exploits that they have posted videos of, in at
least one case, the actors have faked the success of their claimed working exploit. On Jan 14, 2021, the actors shared via
Twitter a YouTube video they uploaded that proclaimed to exploit CVE-2021-1647, a recently patched Windows Defender
vulnerability. In the video, they purported to show a successful working exploit that spawns a cmd.exe shell, but a careful
review of the video shows the exploit is fake. Multiple comments on YouTube identified that the video was faked and that
there was not a working exploit demonstrated. After these comments were made, the actors used a second Twitter account
(that they control) to retweet the original post and claim that it was “not a fake video.”

Security researcher targeting
The actors have been observed targeting specific security researchers by a novel social engineering method. After
establishing initial communications, the actors would ask the targeted researcher if they wanted to collaborate on
vulnerability research together, and then provide the researcher with a Visual Studio Project. Within the Visual Studio Project
would be source code for exploiting the vulnerability, as well as an additional DLL that would be executed through Visual
Studio Build Events. The DLL is custom malware that would immediately begin communicating with actor-controlled C2
domains. An example of the VS Build Event can be seen in the image below.

In addition to targeting users via social engineering, we have also observed several cases where researchers have been
compromised after visiting the actors’ blog. In each of these cases, the researchers have followed a link on Twitter to a writeup hosted on blog.br0vvnn[.]io, and shortly thereafter, a malicious service was installed on the researcher’s system and an
in-memory backdoor would begin beaconing to an actor-owned command and control server. At the time of these visits, the
victim systems were running fully patched and up-to-date Windows 10 and Chrome browser versions. At this time we’re
unable to confirm the mechanism of compromise, but we welcome any information others might have. Chrome
vulnerabilities, including those being exploited in the wild (ITW), are eligible for reward payout under Chrome's Vulnerability
Reward Program. We encourage anyone who discovers a Chrome vulnerability to report that activity via the Chrome VRP
submission process.

These actors have used multiple platforms to communicate with potential targets, including Twitter, LinkedIn, Telegram,
Discord, Keybase and email. We are providing a list of known accounts and aliases below. If you have communicated with
any of these accounts or visited the actors’ blog, we suggest you review your systems for the IOCs provided below. To date,
we have only seen these actors targeting Windows systems as a part of this campaign.
If you are concerned that you are being targeted, we recommend that you compartmentalize your research activities using
separate physical or virtual machines for general web browsing, interacting with others in the research community, accepting
files from third parties and your own security research.
