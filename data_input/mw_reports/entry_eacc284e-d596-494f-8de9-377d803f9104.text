The European Union and its Member States express their solidarity with the United States on
the impact of malicious cyber activities, notably the SolarWinds cyber operation, which, the
United States assesses, has been conducted by the Russian Federation. The compromise
affected governments and businesses worldwide, including in EU Member States. We share
the concerns of our partners about the increasing number of malicious cyber activities, and
are in particular alarmed by the recent increase in activities affecting the security and
integrity of information and communication technology (ICT) products and services, which
might have systemic effects and cause significant harm to our society, security and economy.
Malicious use of ICTs undermines the benefits that the Internet and the use of ICTs provide
to society at large, and shows the readiness of some actors to effectively risk international
security and stability.
All actors must refrain from irresponsible and destabilising behaviour in cyberspace. We will
continue to investigate malicious cyber activities with a view to sustained, joint and
coordinated action to prevent, discourage, deter and respond to such malicious behaviour in
cyberspace, including by closely working with our international partners. We call upon all
States to facilitate and play a constructive role in ongoing investigations, and to take
appropriate action to promote the security and integrity of ICT products and services and
their supply chain.

The European Union and its Member States continue working towards the establishment of a
Programme of Action to Advance Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace within the
United Nations, building on the work of the UN Groups of Governmental Experts in this field,
and the recent endorsement of this framework by the Open-ended Working Group.
The European Union and its Member States remain strongly committed and determined in
their solidarity with their international partners in promoting a global, open, stable and secure
cyberspace respecting human rights, fundamental freedoms, democratic values and
principles and the rule of law, in order for everyone to safely live their lives online, as well as
offline.
The Candidate Countries Turkey, the Republic of North Macedonia, Montenegro and
Albania1 and the EFTA countries Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, members of the
European Economic Area, as well as Ukraine and Georgia align themselves with this
declaration.
1 The Republic of North Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania continue to be part of the

Stabilisation and Association Process.
