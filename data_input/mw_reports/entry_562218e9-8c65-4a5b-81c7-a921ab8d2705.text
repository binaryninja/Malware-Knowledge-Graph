New Andariel Reconnaissance Tactics Hint At Next Targets
Posted on: July 16, 2018 at 8:10 am

Posted in: Bad Sites

Author: Joseph C Chen (Fraud Researcher)

In cooperation with IssueMakersLab of South Korea
Reconnaissance plays a vital role in criminal operations, and
some groups go to great lengths to investigate their targets’
systems. A recent example is the Andariel Group, a known
branch of the notorious Lazarus Group. Last month we tracked
new scouting techniques coming from Andariel, which were
used mainly against South Korean targets.
Andariel has been quite active these past few months.
According to South Korean security researchers
IssueMakersLab, the group used an ActiveX zero-day exploit for
watering hole attacks on South Korean websites last May—they called this “Operation GoldenAxe”.

Security Predictions for 2018

But more recently on June 21, we noticed that Andariel injected their script into four other
compromised South Korean websites for reconnaissance purposes.
We found that the code of the new injected script is similar to the sample Andariel previously used
in May. However, the new script was trying to collect different ActiveX object information and
targeted objects that it wasn’t attacking before.

Attackers are banking on network
vulnerabilities and inherent weaknesses
to facilitate massive malware attacks,

In the earlier case, the group collected targeted ActiveX objects on users’ Internet Explorer
browser before they used the zero-day exploit. This was possibly part of their reconnaissance
strategy, to find the right targets for their exploit. Based on this, we believe it’s likely that the new
targeted ActiveX objects we found could be their next targets for a watering hole exploit attack. To
help prevent any damage, we decided to publish our findings before the group deploys the attack.

IoT hacks, and operational disruptions.
The ever-shifting threats and increasingly
expanding attack surface will challenge
users and enterprises to catch up with
their security.

Business Process Compromise

Attackers are starting to invest in longterm operations that target specific
processes enterprises rely on. They
scout for vulnerable practices,
susceptible systems and operational
loopholes that they can leverage or
abuse. To learn more, read our Security 101:
Business Process Compromise.

Korean local government labor union websites. This reconnaissance lasted until 27 June. We
already notified the websites about the compromise.
We believe that the injected script came from the Andariel group since the code has similar
obfuscation and structure to the sample we previously found from them. The script was used to
collect information from visitors’ browser: browser type, system language, Flash Player version,
Silverlight version, and multiple ActiveX objects.
The original script is from the PluginDetect Library, and it was also used by exploit kits to verify
victims before an attack. The verification process included sending collected information to
another compromised website that hosted their PHP program and was designed to receive the
information.

Figure 2. Compromised website injected with malicious script that collects information
Our colleagues from the IssueMakersLab team shared insights and information about the Andariel
group, including that they attacked ActiveX vulnerabilities as far back as 2007. The team
monitoring Andariel found that the cybercriminal group injected a malicious script on a South
Korean think tank website for reconnaissance in January 2017 and then switched to inject an
ActiveX zero-day exploit in mid-April. IssueMakersLab also listed the ActiveX objects that the
Andariel group attacked.
During analysis, we noticed that the new injected script was trying to detect two additional ActiveX
objects that were not on the previous list. One is “DSDOWNCTRL.DSDownCtrlCtrl.1”, which is
related to a DRM (Digital Rights Management) software from a South Korean Document Protection
Security vendor. Another is “WSACTIVEBRIDGEAX.WSActiveBridgeAXCtrl.1”, which is related to a
South Korea-based voice conversion software company. Many local governments and public

institutions use these software.
We made a table to compare the information that the script samples collected in the previous case
and this more recent case.

Table 1. Comparison of the information collected by the previous and new script
Besides the ActiveX objects, we noticed that the script added new code to connect websocket to
localhost. The voice conversion software has websocket service listening on the local host so the
injected script can detect the software by checking if they can establish a connection to ports
45461 and 45462, which the software uses.
In addition, the verification process in the older script is different from the ActiveX detection, which
was only for the Internet Explorer browser. In the script found in June, the websocket verification
could also be performed on other browsers like Chrome and Firefox. This shows that the attacker
Convert webpages to pdf online w ith PDFmyURL

has expanded his target base, and is interested in the software itself and not just their ActiveX
objects. Based on this change, we can expect them to start using attack vectors other than
ActiveX.

Reconnaissance is the stage where attackers collect information from potential targets to help
them determine what tactics will work. These new developments from the Andariel group give us
an idea of their plans, although we cannot make specific assumptions about their strategy.
To stay one step ahead of threats like this, we recommend that people use layered security
protection in their environments. Trend Micro endpoint solutions such as Trend Micro™ Smart
Protection Suites and Worry-Free™ Business Security can protect users and businesses from
similar threats by detecting malicious files and spammed messages as well as blocking all related
