Credential theft malware continues to be one amongst the foremost prevalent sorts of malware
employed in cyber attacks. The most objective of nearly all credential theft malware is to
assemble the maximum amount of confidential and sensitive information, like user credentials
and financial information, as possible.
The Oski stealer is a malicious information stealer, which was first introduced in November
2019. The Oski stealer steals personal and sensitive credentials from its target so the attackers
responsible can misuse it to get revenue in various ways. Research shows that this information
stealer is distributed through deceptive websites that are opened because of hijacked router
DNS settings.
Oski is currently being sold on Russian underground hacking forums at a low price of $70-$100.

Researchers at ‘CyberArk’ have analyzed the newest malware samples they may get their
hands on and report on the complete list of Oski’s capabilities. Written in C++, the malware can
steal the subsequent things:
Login credentials from different applications
Browser information (cookies, autofill data, and credit cards)
Crypto wallets
System information
Capture Screenshots
Different user files
The code of the malware is super clean and indicates that the author is knowledgeable,
ensuring reliable operation. However, Oski doesn’t have any sophisticated obfuscation, antianalysis, or anti-debugging tricks under its sleeve yet, but this will always be added later. The
very fact that the code basis is neatly done creates the setting to figure on this tool further and
add more features within the future.

Attackers try to trick users into installing Oski by hijacking router DNS settings in order that
browsers then open corrupted pages and pop-ups. This motivates visitors to put in an
application designed to deliver the latest information referring to the COVID-19. In fact, the file
that’s downloaded through these malicious sites installs Oski, a trojan horse capable of stealing
sensitive information. It targets data from browsers like cookies and browsing history, autofill
data, and saved login credentials. It also attempts to steal databases that contain two-factor
authentication data, cryptocurrency wallets, and word files, and might take screenshots of the
victim’s screen and perform other dubious actions. Attackers behind Oski are able to hijack
various accounts, including social media, email, cryptocurrency trading accounts, and so on.

beyond passwords. Cyber criminals misuse stolen accounts to create fraudulent purchases and
transactions, spread spam campaigns, trick other users into paying money to them, steal
identities, etc. They may additionally be able to access text and documents files containing
lead, take screenshots when victim’s open them, or capture other computing activities. Victims
of Oski attacks might thus suffer monetary loss, have their identities stolen, experience
problems regarding online privacy, browsing safety and other serious issues. Therefore, this
malware must be far from infected systems immediately.
