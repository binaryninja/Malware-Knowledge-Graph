Analysis
IOC
The chaos ransomware is fairly new, first appearing in June 2021 as a builder, offered on
multiple darknet forums and marketplaces. It doesn’t appear to have been involved in any
significant incidents yet, a few minecraft players don’t count. Unsurprisingly therefore, the
sample has not had a single transaction to the wallet.
It isn’t very complicated, as likely a simple proof-of-concept ransomware. Simply a 32bit
.NET executable, with the ransom wallpaper base64 encoded in and completely
unobfuscated with names.

Analysis
The execution process is as follows:
Make sure only copy running
If not running from the temp folder, wait 10 seconds (anti-virus evasion)
If not running as admin, copy itself to the roaming folder and run
Add itself to the startup folder
Delete itself, copy itself to the roaming folder and run
Look for directories to encrypt (drives other than C:\ and common user directories)
Recursively encrypt the files with the correct file extension and add a random file
extension
2.2mb are AES encrypted
Over 200mb are partly overwritten with random bytes
Inbetween are randomly overwritten
Write a ransom note read_it.txt to the directory
