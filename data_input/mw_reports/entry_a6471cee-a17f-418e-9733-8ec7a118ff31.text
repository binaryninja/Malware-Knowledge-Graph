About this talk
The MAZE family of ransomware has been actively distributed by threat actors since at least
May 2019. Starting in November 2019, Mandiant Threat Intelligence observed MAZE
operators begin to combine traditional ransomware attacks with corresponding data theft and
extortion demands. Today, the actors behind the MAZE operation now maintain a publicfacing website where they post data stolen from victims who refuse to pay their extortion fee.
Join Mandiant Threat Intelligence for a deep dive into the MAZE ransomware operation,
including details shared by impacted organizations, and insight into the tactics, techniques
and procedures used throughout these prolific and damaging attacks. In this exclusive

1/2

webinar, attendees will learn about: •Common intrusion vectors across MAZE ransomware
incidents •Actors’ reliance upon open-source and commercially available attack tools •Data
exfiltration techniques present across most MAZE ransomware incidents
