Conti and Emotet: A constantly destructive duo
intel471.com/blog/conti-emotet-ransomware-conti-leaks

The relationship between Trickbot, Emotet and Conti has been well documented, with many
security researchers showing how threat actors have used the malware combination to
launch a plethora of schemes. This relationship has come into greater focus in recent weeks,
as the Conti Leaks show just how interdependent Conti affiliates are on Emotet. Through a
combination of information pulled from those leaks and Intel 471’s technical monitoring of
Emotet campaigns, we now have a clearer understanding on how criminals are using Emotet
in concert with Conti.
Intel 471 assesses with high confidence that Emotet malware operators’ spam targets will
enter a pool of potential Conti victims. Intel 471 analyzed Conti ransomware incidents from
Dec. 25, 2021, to March 25, 2022, and discovered over a dozen targets that were recipients of
Emotet malspam. While what Intel 471 measured was based on known attacks, the true
degree of correlation between Emotet spam recipients and Conti ransomware breach victims
may be greater, since not all Conti victims are publicly listed on the name-and-shame blog for
a variety of reasons, including victims opting to pay ransoms to remain anonymous. Intel 471
believes it’s likely that Emotet is highly relied upon by Conti ransomware operators to find
their current victims.
The chart below shows the dates of Emotet showing up on systems, followed by a
ransomware attack where Conti was used.

The negative numbers on the table above indicate that some victims were still receiving
Emotet malspam after a ransomware incident was already listed on Conti’s blog. This is an
important point to highlight as it gives great insight to the overall operation of the Conti
ransomware group and Emotet operators.
While Emotet has been linked in concert with Trickbot and Conti, Emotet does not operate
under the same leadership umbrella (unlike Trickbot, which Conti “acquired” earlier this
year) as the other two forms of malware. The Emotet malspam operation is independent and
massive, with some parts running in an automated manner. What’s likely occurring is that
most Emotet spam recipients are not strictly targeted by a ransomware affiliate using Conti.
Instead, Emotet is used by Conti affiliates to gain initial access. Once access is obtained, the
organization is placed into a pool of potential ransomware targets, where ransomware
operators can select their next victim based on the system information extracted by Emotet.
Even though Emotet operates outside the boundaries of Conti’s leadership, the ransomware
group has made it a key part of their attack chain, specifically as part of the relaunched
Emotet we observed in November 2021.
The previous Emotet operation consistently launched malspam campaigns that dropped
several malware families including IcedID aka Bokbot, Qbot and Trickbot. However, the
updated Emotet malspam operation has been observed dropping only Cobalt Strike payloads
or intermediary payloads, such as SystemBC, to drop Cobalt Strike. We know due to the
Conti Leaks that the group leveraged Cobalt Strike: independent journalist Brian Krebs
reported that Conti invested US $60,000 in acquiring a valid Cobalt Strike license in 2021.
The leaks further revealed evidence that certain members of the Conti team were responsible
for handing Trickbot and Emotet development. The leak revealed the actor “veron” aka
“mors,” who directs the Emotet malware spam operation, reports to a senior manager in the
Conti organization, who uses the “stern” handle. This information aligns with our own
observations and long-term monitoring of Emotet and TrickBot malware campaigns. In past
campaigns, only bots with the Trickbot group tag (gtag) “mors” received commands to
download and execute Emotet. This suggests “mors” added the gtag to Trickbot.
When any organization finds a successful operational process, it leans on it as much as
possible. The Conti Leaks have shown how this group conducts itself like a legitimate
business, adopting well-worn practices that allow it fulfill its goals. These leaks show just how
crucial Emotet has been to Conti’s ransomware schemes. While not every instance of Emotet
means that a ransomware attack is imminent, our research shows that there is a heightened
chance of an attack if Emotet is spotted on organizations’ systems. By being proactive against
Emotet, defenders can save their organizations from further issues that could cause
substantial damage to their operations.
