// 2023-03-29 // SITUATIONAL AWARENESS // CrowdStrike Tracking Active Intrusion
Campaign Targeting 3CX Customers //
What Happened
On March 29, 2023, Falcon OverWatch observed unexpected malicious activity emanating
from a legitimate, signed binary, 3CXDesktopApp — a softphone application from 3CX. The
malicious activity includes beaconing to actor-controlled infrastructure, deployment of
second-stage payloads, and, in a small number of cases, hands-on-keyboard activity.
Falcon Prevent and Insight have behavioral preventions and atomic detections targeting the
abuse of 3CXDesktopApp. OverWatch has notified customers where hands-on-keyboard
activity has been observed and Falcon Complete is in contact with customers under their
management where 3CXDesktopApp is present.
The 3CXDesktopApp is available for Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile. At time of writing,
activity has been observed on both Windows and macOS.
2/6

This is a dynamic situation and updates will be provided here as they become available.
CrowdStrike's Intelligence Team is in contact with 3CX. There is suspected nation-state
involvement by the threat actor LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA.
Detection and Prevention
Falcon has coverage utilizing behavior-based indicators of attack (IOAs) targeting malicious
behaviors associated with 3CX on both MacOS and Windows. Please ensure that your
prevention policies are properly configured with "Suspicious Processes" enabled.
Hunting
Falcon Discover
Falcon Discover customers can use the following link: US-1 | US-2 | EU | Gov to look for the
presence of 3CXDesktopApp in their environment.
Falcon Spotlight
Falcon Spotlight customers can search for CVE-2023-3CX to identify vulnerable versions of
3CX software. Spotlight will automatically highlight this vulnerability in your vulnerability feed.
Falcon Insight - Application Search
Falcon Insight customers can assess if the 3CXDesktopApp is running in their environment
with the following query:
Falcon LTR - Application Search
#event_simpleName=/^(PeVersionInfo|ProcessRollup2)$/ AND (event_platform=Win
ImageFileName=/\\3CXDesktopApp\.exe$/i) OR (event_platform=Mac
ImageFileName=/\/3CX\sDesktop\sApp/i)
| ImageFileName = /.+(\\|\/)(?<FileName>.+)$/i
| groupBy([event_platform, FileName, SHA256HashData], function=count(aid,
distinct=true, as=endpointCount))

Event Search - Application Search
event_simpleName IN (PeVersionInfo, ProcessRollup2) FileName IN ("3CXDesktopApp.exe",
"3CX Desktop App")
| stats dc(aid) as endpointCount by event_platform, FileName, SHA256HashData

Atomic Indicators
The following domains have been observed beaconing which should be considered an
indication of malicious intent.

Recommendations
The current recommendation for all CrowdStrike customers is:
1. Locate the presence of 3CXDesktopApp software in your environment by using the
queries outlined above.
2. Ensure Falcon is deployed to applicable systems.
3. Ensure “Suspicious Processes” is enabled in applicable Prevention Policies.
4. Hunt for historical presence of atomic indicators in third-party tooling (if available).

Specific Tech Alert
CSA-230489 LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA Suspected of Conducting Supply Chain Attack
with 3CX Application: ( US-1 | US-2 | EU | GOV ) [Intelligence subscription required]

Conclusion
Again, this situation is dynamic and we will continue to provide updates as they become
available.
** UPDATE 2023-03-29 20:35 ET **
After review and reverse engineering by the CrowdStrike Intelligence Team, the signed MSI
(aa124a4b4df12b34e74ee7f6c683b2ebec4ce9a8edcf9be345823b4fdcf5d868) is malicious.
The MSI will drop three files, with the primary fulcrum being the compromised binary
ffmpeg.dll (7986bbaee8940da11ce089383521ab420c443ab7b15ed42aed91fd31ce833896).
Once active, the HTTPS beacon structure and encryption key match those observed by
CrowdStrike in a March 7, 2023 campaign attributed with high confidence to DPRK-nexus
threat actor LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA. CrowdStrike Intelligence customers can view the
following reports for full technical details:
CSA-230387: LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA Uses TxRLoader and Vulnerable Drivers to
Target Financial and Energy Sectors ( US-1 | US-2 | EU | GOV )
CSA-230489: LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA Suspected of Conducting Supply Chain Attack
with 3CX Application ( US-1 | US-2 | EU | GOV )
CSA-230494: ArcfeedLoader Malware Used in Supply Chain Attack Leveraging
Trojanized 3CX Installers Confirms Attribution to LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA ( US-1 | US2 | EU | GOV )
At this point, my recommendation would be to remove 3CX software from endpoints until
advised by the vendor that future installers and builds are safe.
** UPDATE 2023-03-30 08:45 ET **
For those looking for additional details on macOS, Patrick Wardle has a great thread on
Twitter where he reverse engineers a 3CX binary (Twitter link). There is also an
associated blog post.
Side note: thanks to all those sharing and crowdsourcing details below. This post has
gotten quite a bit of attention and there are quite a few non-regulars posting and
lurking. It's nice to see everyone stepping up to help one another.
