Bankbot on Google Play
blog.koodous.com/2017/05/bankbot-on-google-play.html

While hunting for malicious applications out there, we found a banking trojan known as
Bankbot in Google Play.
It was found in an early stage so it didn't have enough time to spread, but the current status it
around 500 installations.

Behind this "Downloader for videos" we can find that the true nature of the application is not
really watching videos but rather steal data from users.
In the background, once it's executed in the victims' device it communicates remotely with its
Command and Control server.
http://ughdsay3[.]tk is used as C&C for the banker to communicate.

tuk_tuk.php and set_data.php are common remote files that are used as communications.
Also, the communications in this post can be decrypted.
At the time of this post, the application has ~500 installations and 9 positive reviews, to trick
users into trusting the APK.
