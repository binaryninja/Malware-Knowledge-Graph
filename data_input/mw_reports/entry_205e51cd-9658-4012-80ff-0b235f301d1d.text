A new Twitter account appeared on 27 May 2020 for “NSA Cyber”, claiming the following:
“Welcome to the intersection of threat intel, vulnerability analysis, and technical
expertise! All to better equip you against malicious #cyber activity.”

This was a very interesting development, and a separate effort from the US National Security
Agency/Central Security Service (NSA/CSS) “official” or main Twitter account. Designed as
an outlet specific for the NSA’s relatively new Cybersecurity Directorate, the account quickly
proved its bona fides by posting and linking to an NSA/CSS notification on ongoing
Sandworm activity less than a day later.

While interesting on its own for multiple reasons – adding further attribution fuel to the
Sandworm discussion and shedding light on ongoing activity by a particularly nasty actor –
this is not the first time the Cybersecurity Directorate has directly notified the public of
events. Yet such actions stir confusion and add to an overall incoherence in US government
cybersecurity policy and activity.
NSA/CSS is a US Department of Defense (DOD) entity and the largest component of the US
Intelligence Community. As such, its mission focuses on signals intelligence, cryptography,
and DOD signals and cyber security. The vast majority of NSA’s mission is offensive (or at
least espionage-oriented) in nature, making its role for playing a part in security in any
network beyond DOD highly contentious and controversial. That NSA/CSS is now utilizing
the Cybersecurity Directorate as an external-facing, publicly-communicating cybersecurity
arm is very strange – as presumably this already exists.
Created only in 2018, the US Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) would apparently fill the role of being the US
government’s vector for communicating with private industry given its mission. While CISA is
far from perfect, the idea at least finally created a non-military, civilian cybersecurity agency

2/4

to serve as the focal point of US government non-military cyber efforts. Given NSA/CSS’s
primary mission of signals intelligence (part of which includes conducting cyber intrusions),
the private sector is justifiably concerned that trusting this agency for defense could come at
significant costs. CISA, although junior in age (and potentially expertise), addresses this core
issue of trust by separating the role of liaison from military agencies.
Yet in standing up and using the Cybersecurity Directorate in this way, it would seem that
NSA specifically (and perhaps DOD in general) are working to undermine CISA’s mission
and standing as the lead agency responsible for critical infrastructure defense and
coordinating responses with US private industry. A healthy interagency relationship would
likely involve NSA and DOD communicating with DHS and CISA to share information, with
CISA then taking the lead to promulgate advice and notifications to stakeholders. By going
direct, NSA implicitly has made the statement that CISA does not own this mission, cannot
be trusted to handle or analyze certain types of information (such as the Sandworm
notification), and that NSA (and DOD) will play an independent role in these matters.
While we can argue that NSA will likely retain a capability and talent advantage over any
DHS (or even other DOD) elements for the foreseeable future, legitimate questions of trust
and primary mission focus mean NSA will never take a lead role in coordinating cyber
defense with private industry. Although imperfect, CISA at least represents a move in the
proper direction to create a single point of access (and communication) for US government
cybersecurity capability and concerns to the private sector.
NSA’s use of the Cybersecurity Directorate in this fashion of public communication and
defense advisory undercuts CISA’s mission and continues the overall incoherence of US
cyber policy and cyber defense. For those who have previously worked in the US
government, such activity is not surprising as cyber remains “sexy” – and a continued item of
significance, which means a source of funding and prestige. Thus a scramble has ensued
where various elements of the overall US government – DOD, DHS, the Department of
Energy, the Department of Commerce (hello National Institute of Standards and
Technology!), the Department of Justice, etc. – all attempt to “own” some aspect of the cyber
mission.
Interagency scrambles are especially nasty in the realm of government and private network
defense. NSA, US Cyber Command, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the
Department of Energy (for electric and oil and gas activity), DHS, and CISA all have some
stake in this matter, and some wish to own and direct this mission exclusively. The result is a
mess where an entity with a question, concern, or an incident doesn’t know who to contact –
CISA, their local FBI field office, DOE’s office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and
Emergency Response (CESER), or some other organization.
The muddled ownership of the US government role in communicating with or assisting the
private sector creates various problems. From lack of clarity in communication, uncertainty in
identifying relevant areas of expertise, to “playing one entity against another” tactics where
3/4

organizations “shop around” until finding the agency most cooperative all add friction and
distraction to the overall defensive mission. Ultimately, the US government has a vested
interest in the security of private organizations representing critical infrastructure or national
value (such as intellectual property). That decades into the information age the US
government is still schizophrenic in its approach to the issue is sad and self-defeating. CISA
was (and still could be) a good idea – allowing other entities to basically go rogue and act
independently undercuts an agency that is barely two years old, and will create more
problems than it may solve.
