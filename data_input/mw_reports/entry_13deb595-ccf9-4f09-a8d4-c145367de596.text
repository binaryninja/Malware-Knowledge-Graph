Centreon to Exim and Back: On the Trail of Sandworm
domaintools.com/resources/blog/centreon-to-exim-and-back-on-the-trail-of-sandworm

Background
Sandworm, also referred to as Telebots, Voodoo Bear, and Hades, is a cyber threat group
active since at least 2009. Multiple governments, including the United Kingdom in 2018 and
the United States in 2020, publicly link the group to Russia’s military intelligence service
(commonly referred to as the GRU). The group is notable not only for its longevity, but also
its audacity as Sandworm is associated with multiple high-profile, disruptive incidents such
as the following:

1/18

Given the group’s association with destructive cyber events, such as the 2017 NotPetya
incident, the 2015 TV5 Monde event, and the attempted protection attack against Ukrainian
electric operations in 2016, network defenders and Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)
professionals should be especially attentive to high-confidence disclosures of activity linked
to Sandworm.

Sandworm and Centreon
In early 2021, the French National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI)
released a report on Sandworm-linked activity targeting IT monitoring software produced by
Centreon from late 2017 through 2020. Operations included deployment of the publicly
available P.A.S. webshell (specifically version 3.1.4), as well as Linux malware referred to
by researchers at ESET as “Exaramel” which has only previously been linked to Sandworm
activity. While the former tool is widely available (although also deployed in other operations
linked to Russian intelligence services), the latter is exclusively tied to Sandworm-related
operations, and features extensive code and functionality overlap with other Sandwormlinked tools, as described in ESET’s analysis.
Although the focus on IT monitoring software suggests superficial overlaps with the
SolarWinds-related intrusion activity (tentatively linked to Russian intelligence operations) in
2019, no evidence exists of a similar supply chain vector. Instead, subsequent reporting
indicated older versions of the open source version of Centreon’s software were victimized
as part of this campaign. A statement from Centreon specified that version 2.5.2 of the
software, deprecated in 2014 and unsupported since 2016, was the latest version impacted.

While DomainTools cannot make a definitive determination, based on these details it
appears that the intruder likely used a vulnerability such as CVE-2014-3828, a SQL
injection vulnerability in Centreon patched in version 2.5.3, to write data to the vulnerable
system (such as a webshell) which could facilitate follow-on code execution within the victim
environment. Given details published by ANSSI in terms of webshell file paths (located
2/18

under “/usr/local/centron/www/” and “/usr/share/centreon/www/ directories) and user context
(the “apache” user, which references the Apache web server software used in Centreon
deployments) along with the published CVE referenced, the most-likely path to exploitation
appears to be compromise of a vulnerability in Centreon software as opposed to
compromise of Centreon itself.
In providing analysis of the Centreon exploitation activity, ANSSI outlines technical and
behavioral details observed, but little in the way of technical indicators. Specifically, the
report identifies no network infrastructure associated with the activity aside from a general
comment noting the use of VPN services to connect to webshell instances and a separate
set of Command and Control (C2) nodes to communicate with Exaramel deployments.
While this may appear limiting at first for further research, analysts can look to concurrent
activity linked to Sandworm to gain greater insight into how this threat may have operated
during the approximately three year long Centreon campaign.

Examining the Exim Campaign
In May 2020, the US National Security Agency (NSA) issued a brief report: “Sandworm
Actors Exploiting Vulnerability in Exim Mail Transfer Agent”. The report is notable for two
reasons: First, the report explicitly identifies Sandworm as “the GRU Main Center for
Special Technologies (GTsST), field post number 74455.” Second, and related to the ANSSI
report, the NSA details a campaign which overlaps with the Centreon activity, taking place
from August 2019 through May 2020.
The campaign described by NSA involves exploitation of the Exim Mail Transfer Agent
(MTA) software. Used for transferring email between servers via SMTP, MTA software is
network-accessible by design, with Exim being the default MTA for many variants of Linux.
The vulnerability linked to Sandworm activity, CVE-2019-10149, can allow for Remote Code
Execution (RCE) on the vulnerable host depending on Exim’s configuration and if it is
remotely accessible. If accessible, the Exim exploit can facilitate both initial access to victim
networks as well as lateral movement to other servers with listening, accessible Exim MTA
instances.
Exploitation of this RCE vulnerability is relatively trivial. In the following image included from
NSA reporting, Sandworm operations leveraged the exploit to retrieve a shell script from a
remote resource and then execute it:

3/18

Unfortunately, while the script’s functions are described at a relatively high level in the
report, it does not provide in-depth detail. Although some of the network infrastructure used
to execute these attacks is noted, this consists of only two IP addresses and a domain:
95.216.13[.]196
103.94.157[.]5
hostapp[.]be

Although apparently circumscribed, with historical network data including hosting records
and passive DNS (pDNS), CTI analysts can begin identifying characteristics and
fundamental aspects of this infrastructure during its period of use (August 2019 through
May 2020). To start, we can examine the domain. Of note, since “.be” is a country-level Top
Level Domain (TLD) associated with Belgium, the complete WhoIs record cannot (for legal
reasons) be retrieved and archived by services such as DomainTools. Looking at the
current WhoIs information through the Belgian WhoIs service shows that, since the NSA’s
report, the domain has been re-registered:

However, examining limited data archived via DomainTools, we can at least get an
understanding of when the domain was first registered for use in the Exim campaign as well
as limited infrastructure details:

4/18

While WhoIs registration information is not captured, we can still observe two
characteristics of this infrastructure:
Registration via Tucows.
Authoritative name servers provided by Njalla.
While fairly general characteristics shared by a number of suspicious domains, we at least
now have a better understanding of how this adversary was registering infrastructure, as
well as when: 24 December 2018. Examination of hosting information and pDNS records is
more fruitful:

5/18

Several items emerge from the above pDNS data:

6/18

1. The data confirms one of the IP addresses listed by NSA (95.216.13[.]196) was used
to host hostapp[.]be during the operational window.
2. The other IP address noted by NSA, 103.94.157[.]5, is not associated with
hostapp[.]be in available pDNS data.
3. Several additional, not previously disclosed IP addresses are also associated with the
domain.
The first point is useful, but the other two provide avenues for further research. Looking at
the IP not associated with the domain but linked by NSA with Exim exploitation, no firm
domain links appear except to the following item from May 2020 (approximately the same
time as the NSA report’s release) through January 2021:
Monitor.sbp[.]hk

This specific resource does not resolve, but sbp[.]hk appears to be a template page for web
design with no clear, legitimate functionality. However, the name does link to the hosting
provider, SBP Corporation, located in India. Overall, nothing of value appears related to this
indicator at present.
More interesting are the previously undisclosed items linked to hostapp[.]be:
185.44.76[.]193
94.75.193[.]239
85.158.77[.]2
145.14.133[.]105
176.10.104[.]219

Of these, 176.10.104[.]219 appears most significant and responsible for the majority of
responses for hostapp[.]be from November 2019 to the end of December 2019. These
items are explored in greater detail in the following section. Notably, records cease linking to
the domain after 26 December 2019 until 28 May 2020—the same day the NSA report was
released—when the domain shifts to various GoDaddy parking IP addresses.
While the above research identified new, previously unobserved indicators correlated with
Sandworm operations, additional work is required to both understand these and cement any
links with the notorious group.

Likely Purpose

While there are several outliers, at least for the items most closely associated with Exim
exploitation and hosting hostapp.be, Sandworm appears to favor European hosting
providers correlated with privacy-focused legal regimes or companies. While all of the
above items were hosted with hostapp.be at some point, the majority were only linked to the
domain for a day or two in November 2019, and their precise functionality is indeterminate
without additional data.
Yet one of the IP addresses associated with Sandworm activity from July 2019 to early
November 2019, 95.216.13[.]196, shows a link to a BASH shell script with the following
characteristics:
MD5: 92d078d05e89c55b7bb7187fd1c53bdd
SHA256: dc074464e50502459038ac127b50b8c68ed52817a61c2f97f0add33447c8f730

Review of this object shows immediate items of concern:

8/18

Reviewing this portion of the script, the following takes place:
A new authorized key is added to the SSH configuration.
A new root-level user, “mysql_db”, is created with a hard-coded password, and added
as an allowed SSH user.
The script performs a check for the SSH listening port on the victim machine, and
sends this back to 205.204.66[.]196 as a parameter.
Of note, the IP address referenced, hosted by Netelligent in Canada, is also used in a script
with similar functionality as that above:
MD5: d61d598106b04520a018dfa58e707ab2
SHA256: 538d713cb47a6b5ec6a3416404e0fc1ebcbc219a127315529f519f936420c80e

Yet the first script identified contains further functionality that merits exploration. For
example, the following Python code, encoded as a base64 object, is decoded and executed
with the script, then added to the system crontab for weekly execution:

9/18

Functionality is somewhat straightforward:
Check for a running process named “Little Snitch,” an application firewall and
connection monitoring tool associated with MacOS; if found, the script exits.
Attempt to connect to IP 95.216.13[.]196 via HTTP on port 8080 with a hardcoded
User Agent string and cookie value.
Decode the response with a hard-coded encryption key, and execute the result.
Unfortunately, DomainTools was unable to recover a payload from the IP address. However,
two items stand out from the above steps:
1. The script is designed to silently exit in the presence of network monitoring tools
associated with MacOS. While MacOS supports Exim, this is not a default item as
MacOS uses Postfix instead.
2. The script utilizes a User Agent value that would be associated with a Windows
system, when Exim is a Linux/Unix application creating a mismatch in traffic visibility
and expectations if examined.
In addition to this item, an additional encoded Python program is also embedded in the
script that executes on initial load and is added to a weekly crontab:

This item is somewhat simpler than the first:
Again create a hard-coded User Agent string, representative of a Windows system.

10/18

Initiate a connection to 95.216.13[.]196 via HTTP over TCP 53 (normally associated
with DNS zone transfers).
Execute the returned payload.
Again, DomainTools was unable to recover the payload in this instance. Both items,
especially given their addition to weekly crontab entries, appear designed for persistence,
either downloading and executing some follow-on payload or sequence of commands.
Nonetheless, at this stage we have significantly enriched the original findings of the NSA
report on Exim activity, as well as identifying potential infrastructure tendencies linked to
Sandworm from July 2019 through at least December 2019.
Unfortunately, we have not yet identified anything linking this campaign or its technical
indicators to the Centreon-based intrusions. However, the information yielded in the above
investigation can be used to cast our investigative net wider in search of infrastructure or
other artifacts which may link back to Sandworm operations.

Identifying a Possible Linked Credential Theft Campaign
At this stage of analysis, we possess multiple IP addresses but still only one domain, and
two scripting objects that link back to already-known infrastructure. One possible
infrastructure hunting hypothesis would be to look for similar domains registered in
approximately the same period (December 2018). Searching for domains beginning with
“hostapp” created in December 2018 returns interesting results:

In addition to matching the pattern of hostapp[.]be in hosting, these items also link to
interesting subdomains, such as the following:
i.ua.account-check.hostapp[.]link
facebook.com.webapp.hostapp[.]art
twitter.com.webapp.hostapp[.]art

Furthermore, the IP addresses represent new observables that reveal additional domains
with similar subdomains spoofing a variety of mail and social media services:
11/18

While investigating this new path, DomainTools researchers identified another “name
cluster” created in December 2018 similar to the hostapp domains:
Spdup[.]art
Spdup[.]be
Spdup[.]info

All registered on 22 December 2018 via Tucows and Njalla name servers, they also link to
additional IP addresses and subdomains:
google-settings.spdup[.]be
passport.www.mail.yandex.ru.spdup[.]be
accounts.google-account-settings.spdup[.]art
google-settingsapi.spdup[.]info

A complete list of primary domains and associated IP addresses at time of use is provided
in Appendices A and B, respectively. The precise functions of these items (and related
infrastructure) is not completely clear in all cases. Examination of some items does reveal
spoofed logon pages which could be leveraged for credential capture. For example, the
“passport.www.mail.yandex[.]ru” subdomain above resolved to the following spoofed logon
page for Yandex as late as November 2019:

12/18

Reviewing subdomains overall, the primary emphasis appears to be spoofing services tied
to Ukraine, Bulgaria, and Russia, with a handful of items that appear to have a general
European Union (EU) theme. For this latter observation, the following items appear
interspersed with more specific references to Russia or Ukraine:
yanoo.com.userarea[.]eu
drive.google.com.filepreview.auth.userarea[.]click

Reviewing items linked in the appendices, some were active long after release of NSA’s
Exim report and potentially into early 2021. Yet the majority appear to have been detected
around May or June 2020, and have been “sinkholed” on Amazon Web Services (AWS) IP
52.45.178[.]122 or related addresses since.

Implications for Understanding Sandworm
While the previous section appears to identify a cluster of activity adjacent to publicly
documented Sandworm operations, such links—although likely given the persistence in
naming themes and sharing of hosting infrastructure—cannot be proved with available
information. Nonetheless, in the process of expanding our view into known elements of

13/18

adversary activity, we as CTI analysts have greatly expanded our view into likely related,
concurrent operations by a disruptive threat actor. While we identified a number of
additional indicators, we more critically delineated adversary behaviors:
Understanding of Linux-environment alterations used by Sandworm for system
modification and persistence within the Exim campaign.
Identification of infrastructure hosting and registration tendencies within the timeframe
covered by both NSA and ANSSI reporting.
Uncovering a likely concurrent credential harvesting campaign linked to Sandworm
infrastructure with specific items targeting several Eastern European countries.
Unfortunately, we did not succeed in achieving the goal we set out to satisfy: identifying
infrastructure associated with the Centreon exploitation activity documented by ANSSI. Yet
although we failed in identifying specific infrastructure linked to this campaign, we did reveal
tendencies which held during the 2017-2020 timeframe in which this campaign was active
that could be used by defenders and analysts to disposition possible Sandworm-related
intrusions. For example, the combination of registration, name server, hosting, and domain
naming tendencies documented above and shown in the following appendices reveal
adversary tendencies during the period of operation.
Overall, the investigation above reveals several aspects linked to Sandworm-related activity,
if not directly associated with GRU Unit 74455 (based on NSA and other government
attribution statements):
Widespread infrastructure creation with an emphasis on European hosting providers.
Domain name tendencies that either reflect plausible items directly in root domains, or
mimicking legitimate services through long subdomains.
Significant operations targeting Linux environments across both the Exim and
Centreon campaigns, including the use of both Linux-specific malware (Exaramel
deployment) and native system commands (Exim post-exploitation activity).
Continuous credential capture activity targeting a variety of email and social media
services, with an emphasis on Ukraine, Bulgaria, and Russia, but with unknown
intentions and purpose.

Conclusion
Starting with revelations concerning Sandworm-linked activity targeting French IT
monitoring software, we identified certain overall adversary tendencies and intrusion
possibilities leading to a previously-documented campaign leveraging a vulnerability in the
Exim MTA. Based on further in-depth analysis of this campaign, we revealed additional
infrastructure and adversary tendencies that shed light on a widespread credential
harvesting campaign.

14/18

While we failed in our initial goal of attempting to identify concrete links between the
Centreon and Exim campaigns given their temporal overlap, we nonetheless succeeded in
learning significantly more about a deeply concerning adversary. Armed with this
knowledge, network defenders and CTI analysts can mine internal data repositories and
external information sources for further links or to disposition prior intrusions now
illuminated with these discoveries.
By applying the investigative and enrichment techniques detailed above with respect to
Sandworm to other threats of interest, we can gain greater insight into fundamental
adversary tradecraft and tendencies. Equipped with this insight, defenders and CTI
professionals can then more accurately or efficiently research and prosecute intrusions by
having the background knowledge necessary to appropriately categorize and understand
identified intrusions and their related artifacts.
