Emotet Makes Timely Adoption of Political and Elections Lures

October 01, 2020 Axel F. and the Proofpoint Threat Research Team
During the 76 days since Emotet’s return, researchers have observed activity reminiscent
of past Emotet campaigns, like high message volumes and global distribution.
Emotet uses a variety of lure themes, some of which occasionally leverage current
events or news items, like COVID-19 or Greta Thunberg. While TA542, the actor
behind Emotet, has sent messages to local, state, and other government recipients,
historically they have not directly leveraged political themes in their messaging.
On October 1, 2020, we observed thousands of Emotet email messages with the
subject “Team Blue Take Action” sent to hundreds of organizations in the US. The message
body is taken directly from a page on the Democratic National Committee's website, with the
addition of a line requesting that the recipient open the attached document.
Attached is a malicious Word document, “Team Blue Take Action.” The Word doc contains
macros which, if enabled by the intended recipient, will download and install Emotet. The
current second stage payload we’ve observed following Emotet is Qbot "partner01" and The
Trick "morXXX" (e.g., "mor125").

The shift to using politically themed lures comes days after the first of several 2020 US
Presidential debates. The debate received widespread media coverage, and as Election Day
draws nearer, many voters are likely feeling compelled to volunteer for political causes or for
the election in some way. However, it’s unlikely that this shift is driven by any specific political
ideology. Like earlier use of COVID-19 or Greta Thunberg lure themes, TA542 is attempting
to reach as many intended recipients as possible by capitalizing on a popular topic.
