Security

Plus: Android trojan in 100,000+ app installs, Solaris malware

Cybersecurity researchers with Cisco have outlined probable links between the
BlackMatter/DarkSide ransomware ring responsible for last year's high-profile raid on the
Colonial Pipeline, and an emerging ransomware-as-a-service product dubbed BlackCat.
In a write-up this month, Cisco's Talos threat intelligence unit said a domain name and IP
addresses used in a BlackCat infection in December had also been used in a BlackMatter
ransomware deployment three months earlier.
In addition, the team outlined tools, file names, and techniques that are common to both the
BlackMatter and BlackCat ransomware variants. As a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS)
operation, BlackCat can be rented by criminal affiliates to infect and extort targets, with the
malware's developers typically getting a cut of the ransom.

Given that the affiliates are individually responsible for compromising their victims' systems
and deploying the actual ransomware binaries, "it is likely that attacks carried out by the
same ransomware family may differ in techniques and procedures," Talos's Tiago Pereira
and Caitlin Huey noted. In other words, affiliates infect victims in different ways with the same
ransomware.
At the same time, RaaS operators often make training materials, general techniques, and
tools available to affiliates – as shown by the documents leaked from the Conti ransomware
gang – so you'd expect to see some similarities in the attacks carried out by these
miscreants.
Still, each ransomware strain should have its own command-and-control (C2) systems, and
yet overlapping C2 resources were seen in BlackMatter and BlackCat infections, fueling
rumors of strong ties between the two. The Talos team further speculated that "a BlackMatter
affiliate was likely an early adopter – possibly in the first month of operation – of BlackCat."
This is interesting because it sheds some light on the interconnected networks of criminals
menacing organizations. It's also useful to know what to look out for when defending against
or gaining early detection of this kind of ransomware.
Those rumors of a close connection began as soon as BlackCat caught the attention of
cybersecurity vendors and researchers. The MalwareHunter Team tweeted about the
ransomware group in December and other threat intelligence groups, such as S2W out of
South Korea, reported similarities between some of configuration fields used by both
BlackCat and BlackMatter.
However, there also were differences. For instance, BlackCat was written in Rust, while
ransomware from both DarkSide and BlackMatter – the latter a rebranded DarkSide group –
were written in C/C++, S2W wrote in an analysis.
Speaking of malware... Pradeo says it has spotted an Android app installed more than
100,000 times from the Google Play Store that has a trojan in it called Facestealer. This
socially engineers victims into handing over their Facebook login details, which are passed to
a Russian server. The app in question was Craftsart Cartoon Photo Tools, which has since
been removed by Google. If for some reason you have it installed, get rid of it.
Mandiant has documented the activities of a team it's called UNC2891 and its targeting of
Solaris systems with backdoors dubbed TINYSHELL and SLAPSTICK and a rootkit called
CAKETAP. It is believed CAKETAP was used to alter messages on ATM networks to pull off
fraudulent withdrawals from banks using bogus payment cards. UNC2891, we're told, is
skilled on Unix and Linux-flavored machines, is financially motivated, and has gone for years
undetected in large systems.
A BlackCat representative in a February interview with Recorded Future said the two groups
had a "connection" but that BlackCat was not a rebranding of BlackMatter.

The representative also said BlackCat is an affiliate of other RaaS groups, and that they took
knowledge from other outfits. If true, BlackCat is an example of vertical business expansion –
controlling the upstream supply chain by making a service better suited for their needs and
adding another potential avenue for revenue, the Talos researchers wrote.
Vertical expansion also is a business strategy when there is distrust in the supply chain.
"There are several cases of vulnerabilities in ransomware encryption and even of backdoors
that can explain a lack of trust in RaaS," they wrote. "One particular case mentioned by the
BlackCat representative was a flaw in DarkSide/Blackmatter ransomware allowing victims to
decrypt their files without paying the ransom. Victims used this vulnerability for several
months, resulting in big losses for affiliates."

Double blow
BlackCat – also known as ALPHV – is being used in double-ransomware attacks, where the
files not only are encrypted but victims are threatened with public disclosure of the files if the
ransom isn't paid. BlackCat first appeared in November 2021 and has infected several
companies in different parts of the world. That said, more than 30 percent of the
compromises have hit US-based companies, according to Talos.
When comparing the BlackMatter intrusion in September and the BlackCat one in December,
the Talos team believed the pair of cyber-attacks were run by the same affiliate. Both raids
went the usual way: an initial compromise followed by exploration and data exfiltration,
preparation, and then execution of the extortionware.
There were further similarities: for both the BlackMatter and BlackCat infections, the methods
to achieve persistence – a reverse SSH tunnel and scheduled tasks – were the same as well
as lateral movements and the C2 domain. In addition, local and domain user credentials
were collected on some key systems by dumping the LSASS process memory and extracting
the credentials with Microsoft Sysinternals Procdump and Dumpert.
"In both attacks, before the actual execution of the ransomware, the attackers performed
several actions preparing systems to make the execution as successful as possible," the
researchers wrote. "On the day of the attack, the attacker logged in to the domain controller
and opened the group policy management interface. The attackers then dropped and
executed a file named 'apply.ps1.' We believe this script created and prepared the group
policy to cause the execution of the ransomware throughout the domain."
The researchers admitted they still don't know how tightly related BlackCat is to BlackMatter,
but that given the overlapping tools, techniques, and infrastructure of the two infections, they
have "moderate confidence" that BlackMatter affiliates were probably among the early
adopters of BlackCat.

3/9

"As we have seen several times before, RaaS services come and go," they wrote. "Their
affiliates, however, are likely to simply move on to a new service. And with them, many of
their TTPs [techniques, tactics and procedures] are likely to persist." ®

Big Tech loves talking up privacy – while trying to kill privacy legislation
Study claims Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft work to derail data rules
Thomas Claburn in San Francisco Fri 27 May 2022 // 21:48 UTC
Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft often support privacy in public
statements, but behind the scenes they've been working through some common
organizations to weaken or kill privacy legislation in US states.
That's according to a report this week from news non-profit The Markup, which said the
corporations hire lobbyists from the same few groups and law firms to defang or drown
state privacy bills.
The report examined 31 states when state legislatures were considering privacy
legislation and identified 445 lobbyists and lobbying firms working on behalf of Amazon,

SEC probes Musk for not properly disclosing Twitter stake
Meanwhile, social network's board rejects resignation of one its directors
Katyanna Quach Fri 27 May 2022 // 21:26 UTC
America's financial watchdog is investigating whether Elon Musk adequately disclosed
his purchase of Twitter shares last month, just as his bid to take over the social media
company hangs in the balance.
A letter [PDF] from the SEC addressed to the tech billionaire said he "[did] not appear"
to have filed the proper form detailing his 9.2 percent stake in Twitter "required 10 days
from the date of acquisition," and asked him to provide more information. Musk's
shares made him one of Twitter's largest shareholders.
Musk quickly moved to try and buy the whole company outright in a deal initially worth
over $44 billion. Musk sold a chunk of his shares in Tesla worth $8.4 billion and bagged
another $7.14 billion from investors to help finance the $21 billion he promised to put
forward for the deal. The remaining $25.5 billion bill was secured via debt financing by
Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Barclays, and others. But the takeover is not going
smoothly.

Cloud security unicorn cuts 20% of staff after raising $1.3b
Time to play blame bingo: Markets? Profits? Too much growth? Russia? Space aliens?
Jessica Lyons Hardcastle Fri 27 May 2022 // 19:19 UTC 2
Cloud security company Lacework has laid off 20 percent of its employees, just months
after two record-breaking funding rounds pushed its valuation to $8.3 billion.
A spokesperson wouldn't confirm the total number of employees affected, though told
The Register that the "widely speculated number on Twitter is a significant
overestimate."
The company, as of March, counted more than 1,000 employees, which would push
the jobs lost above 200. And the widely reported number on Twitter is about 300
employees. The biz, based in Silicon Valley, was founded in 2015.

Talos names eight deadly sins in widely used industrial software
Entire swaths of gear relies on vulnerability-laden Open Automation Software (OAS)
Jeff Burt Fri 27 May 2022 // 18:30 UTC
A researcher at Cisco's Talos threat intelligence team found eight vulnerabilities in the
Open Automation Software (OAS) platform that, if exploited, could enable a bad actor
to access a device and run code on a targeted system.
The OAS platform is widely used by a range of industrial enterprises, essentially
facilitating the transfer of data within an IT environment between hardware and
software and playing a central role in organizations' industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)
efforts. It touches a range of devices, including PLCs and OPCs and IoT devices, as
well as custom applications and APIs, databases and edge systems.
Companies like Volvo, General Dynamics, JBT Aerotech and wind-turbine maker AES
are among the users of the OAS platform.

Despite global uncertainty, $500m hit doesn't rattle Nvidia execs
CEO acknowledges impact of war, pandemic but says fundamentals ‘are really good’
Dylan Martin Fri 27 May 2022 // 16:08 UTC 1
Nvidia is expecting a $500 million hit to its global datacenter and consumer business in
the second quarter due to COVID lockdowns in China and Russia's invasion of
Ukraine. Despite those and other macroeconomic concerns, executives are still
optimistic about future prospects.
"The full impact and duration of the war in Ukraine and COVID lockdowns in China is
difficult to predict. However, the impact of our technology and our market opportunities
remain unchanged," said Jensen Huang, Nvidia's CEO and co-founder, during the
company's first-quarter earnings call.
Those two statements might sound a little contradictory, including to some investors,
particularly following the stock selloff yesterday after concerns over Russia and China
prompted Nvidia to issue lower-than-expected guidance for second-quarter revenue.

Another AI supercomputer from HPE: Champollion lands in France
That's the second in a week following similar system in Munich also aimed at
researchers
Dan Robinson Fri 27 May 2022 // 15:30 UTC
HPE is lifting the lid on a new AI supercomputer – the second this week – aimed at
building and training larger machine learning models to underpin research.
Based at HPE's Center of Excellence in Grenoble, France, the new supercomputer is
to be named Champollion after the French scholar who made advances in deciphering
Egyptian hieroglyphs in the 19th century. It was built in partnership with Nvidia using
AMD-based Apollo computer nodes fitted with Nvidia's A100 GPUs.
Champollion brings together HPC and purpose-built AI technologies to train machine
learning models at scale and unlock results faster, HPE said. HPE already provides
HPC and AI resources from its Grenoble facilities for customers, and the broader
research community to access, and said it plans to provide access to Champollion for
scientists and engineers globally to accelerate testing of their AI models and research.

UK monopoly watchdog investigates Google's online advertising business
Another probe? Mountain View is starting to look like a pincushion at this rate
Richard Currie Fri 27 May 2022 // 14:00 UTC 3
The UK's Competition and Markets Authority is lining up yet another investigation into
Google over its dominance of the digital advertising market.
This latest inquiry, announced Thursday, is the second major UK antitrust investigation
into Google this year alone. In March this year the UK, together with the European
Union, said it wished to examine Google's "Jedi Blue" agreement with Meta to allegedly
favor the former's Open Bidding ads platform.
The news also follows proposals last week by a bipartisan group of US lawmakers to
create legislation that could force Alphabet's Google, Meta's Facebook, and Amazon to

GitHub saved plaintext passwords of npm users in log files, post mortem reveals
Unrelated to the OAuth token attack, but still troubling as org reveals details of around
100,000 users were grabbed by the baddies
Richard Speed Fri 27 May 2022 // 12:15 UTC 7
GitHub has revealed it stored a "number of plaintext user credentials for the npm

GitHub's logging systems.
The information came to light when the company today published the results of its
investigation into April's unrelated OAuth token theft attack, where it described how an
attacker grabbed data including the details of approximately 100,000 npm users.
The code shack went on to assure users that the relevant log files had not been leaked
in any data breach; that it had improved the log cleanup; and that it removed the logs in
question "prior to the attack on npm."
