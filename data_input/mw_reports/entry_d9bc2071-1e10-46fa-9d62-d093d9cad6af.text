Executive Summary
Over the course of three months, a persistent and determined APT actor has launched
multiple campaigns which have now resulted in compromises to at least 4 additional
organizations, for a total of 13. Beginning on Sept. 16, 2021, the U.S. Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released an alert warning that advanced persistent
threat (APT) actors were actively exploiting newly identified vulnerabilities in a self-service
password management and single sign-on solution known as ManageEngine ADSelfService
Plus. Building upon the findings of that initial report, on Nov. 7, Unit 42 disclosed a second,
more sophisticated, active and difficult-to-detect campaign that had resulted in the
compromise of at least nine organizations.

As an update to our initial reporting, over the past month we have observed the threat actor
expand its focus beyond ADSelfService Plus to other vulnerable software. Most notably,
between Oct. 25 and Nov. 8, the actor shifted attention to several organizations running a
different Zoho product known as ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus. We now track the
combined activity as the TiltedTemple campaign. In our Nov. 7 blog, we stated that “while
attribution is still ongoing and we have been unable to validate the actor behind the
campaign, we did observe some correlations between the tactics and tooling used in the
cases we analyzed and Threat Group 3390 (TG-3390, Emissary Panda, APT27).” At this
stage, we would note that correlation to those tactics and tooling is accurate, but attribution
remains ongoing. In line with the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center’s (MSTIC) findings,
some portions of TiltedTemple, specifically the September attacks exploiting ManageEngine
ADSelfService Plus overlaps with activity associated with DEV-0322, which according to
MSTIC is “a group operating out of China, based on observed infrastructure, victimology,
tactics, and procedures.”
ServiceDesk Plus is a help desk and asset management software. On Nov. 22, Zoho
released a security advisory alerting customers of active exploitation against newly
registered CVE-2021-44077. The vulnerability impacted ServiceDesk Plus versions 11305
and below. While we have been unable to identify any publicly available proof of concept
code for this vulnerability, it is now clear that the actor has successfully determined how to
exploit unpatched versions of the software. Additionally, upon exploitation, the actor has
been observed uploading a new dropper to victim systems. Similar to the previous tactics
used against the ADSelfService software, this dropper deploys a Godzilla webshell which
provides the actor with further access to and persistence in compromised systems. In
scoping the problem, we leveraged Xpanse capabilities to determine that there are currently
over 4,700 internet-facing instances of ServiceDesk Plus globally, and 2,900 – or 62% – are
assessed to be vulnerable to exploitation.
In light of these recent developments, we would advance our characterization of the threat to
that of an APT(s) conducting a persistent campaign, and leveraging a variety of initial access
vectors, to compromise a diverse set of targets globally. Over the past three months, at least
13 organizations across the technology, energy, healthcare, education, finance and defense
industries have been compromised. Of the four new victims, two were compromised through
vulnerable ADSelfService Plus servers while two were compromised through ServiceDesk
Plus software. We anticipate that this number will climb as the actor continues to conduct
reconnaissance activities against these industries and others, including infrastructure
associated with five U.S. states.
Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from the threats described in this blog by Threat
Prevention for the Next-Generation Firewall, Cortex XDR and WildFire signatures.
Additionally, Cortex Xpanse can accurately identify vulnerable versions of ADSelfService
Plus and ServiceDesk Plus software.

Recent Activity
Upon performing a thorough analysis across all of our telemetry sets, we observed that
between Sept. 17 and Oct. 15, the actor conducted reconnaissance and exploitation
activities against ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus software, as documented in our
previous report.
The threat actor, however, quickly began to expand the scope. Notably, following the initial
campaign, we witnessed a steady flow of connections from the actor's malicious
infrastructure to Zoho infrastructure beginning on Oct. 21 and continuing through Nov. 9. The
actors accessed archives.manageengine[.]com and download.manageengine[.]com.
Browsing to the first site presents visitors with a form they can submit to request access to
older versions of ManageEngine software.

Figure 1.

Screenshot of archives.manageengine[.]comGiven this pattern of activity, we believe the
actor may have used this portal to request older vulnerable versions of software in order to
develop working exploits for known CVEs. Four days after this activity began, on Oct. 25, we
observed the first reconnaissance activity against a U.S. financial organization running a

3/10

vulnerable version of ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus. In the days that followed, we
observed similar activity across six other organizations, with exploitation against one U.S.
defense organization and one tech organization beginning as early as Nov. 3.
In continuing to track this actor's activities, we believe it is also important to note that on Nov.
9, we observed the actor connecting to passwordmanagerpromsp[.]com. This domain is
associated with another ManageEngine product that provides Managed Service Providers
(MSPs) with the ability to manage passwords across multiple customers in a single instance.
Earlier this year, Zoho released a patch for CVE-2021-33617 affecting this product. While we
have not seen any exploitation attempts to date, given the actor’s emerging pattern of
targeting ManageEngine products and the actor’s interest in this third product, we highly
recommend organizations apply the relevant patches.

ServiceDesk Plus Vulnerability
On Nov. 20, a record for CVE-2021-44077 was created. Two days later, Zoho released a
security advisory alerting customers of active exploitation against an unauthenticated remote
code execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting ServiceDesk Plus versions up to 11305. With a
severity rating of critical, this vulnerability can allow an adversary to execute arbitrary code
and carry out subsequent attacks. However, it is also worth noting that Zoho released an
update on Sept. 16, three months earlier, that prevents exploitation in versions 11306 and
above.
We are not currently aware of any publicly available proof of concept code for how to exploit
this vulnerability. Additionally, given that the vulnerability was only disclosed after attacks
began, we assess that the actor independently developed exploit code for their attacks.

4/10

We analyzed Zoho's ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus to determine how the actors would
exploit this vulnerability. We confirmed the existence of an RCE vulnerability that leveraged
ServiceDesk's REST API. The exploit requires a malicious actor to issue two requests to the
REST API. The first is to upload an executable specifically named msiexec.exe and the
second request launches the msiexec.exe payload. Both of these requests are required for
successful exploitation, and both are initiated remotely via the REST API without requiring
authentication to the ServiceDesk server. With our understanding of this vulnerability, we
created the threat prevention signature Zoho ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus File Upload
Vulnerability (91949) to block inbound exploitation attempts.

Msiexec.exe Analysis
After successfully exploiting an internet-facing instance of ServiceDesk Plus, on Nov. 3, the
actor uploaded and attempted to run a malicious dropper called msiexec.exe (SHA256:
ecd8c9967b0127a12d6db61964a82970ee5d38f82618d5db4d8eddbb3b5726b7). This file
was uploaded to the server via the ServiceDesk REST API during exploitation, after which
the server saved the executable to the following path:
D:\ManageEngine\ServiceDesk\bin\msiexec.exe
Static analysis of this file shows that it was compiled a few days earlier on Oct. 31, thus
suggesting it was available for use against other vulnerable targets in preceding days.
Additionally, as seen in malware in previous campaigns, the author of this payload did not
remove debug symbols when compiling this sample, which provided two interesting
analytical leads. The debug symbol path was as follows:
C:\Users\pwn\documents\visual studio 2015\Projects\payloaddll\Release\sd11301.pdb
The first interesting portion of the debug path is the username of pwn that was used to create
this payload, which is the same username seen in the debug path within the
ME_ADManager.exe dropper delivered in the attacks on ADSelfService Plus. Secondly, the
filename of sd11301.pdb suggests that the payload was specifically designed to target
ServiceDesk Plus versions 11301 and below, which are vulnerable to CVE-2021-44077 as
well as an older CVE-2021-37415.
As mentioned above, the actor would execute this payload during the exploitation of CVE2021-44077 by issuing a second request to the REST API, which instructs the ServiceDesk
application to run the following command:
msiexec.exe /i Site24x7WindowsAgent.msi EDITA1=<unique site24x7 API key> /qn
The ServiceDesk application runs this command as part of the setup of Zoho’s Site24x7
product, which is described as a “Performance Monitoring Solution for DevOps and IT
Operations.” The documentation for the Site24x7 product details how to install the software
using a legitimate copy of msiexec.exe as follows:
5/10

msiexec.exe /i Site24x7WindowsAgent.msi EDITA1=<Device Key> /qn
Therefore, the actor uploads the malicious msiexec.exe payload and tricks ServiceDesk into
running it instead of the legitimate msiexec.exe application. We confirmed that the malicious
msiexec.exe dropper does not actually use any of the other arguments passed on the
command line.
Upon successful execution, this sample starts by creating the following generic mutex, which
can be found in many code examples freely available on the internet. This mutex prevents
multiple instances of the dropper from running on the same victim host, which is the same
mutex as seen in the ME_ADManager.exe dropper delivered in previous attacks on attacks
on ADSelfService Plus:
cplusplus_me
The dropper then attempts to write a hardcoded Java module to the following location:
../lib/tomcat/tomcat-postgres.jar
The tomcat-postgres.jar (SHA256:
67ee552d7c1d46885b91628c603f24b66a9755858e098748f7e7862a71baa015) file is a
variant of the Godzilla webshell that leverages Apache Tomcat’s Java Servlet Filter
functionality, which we will describe in the next section. In order to load the webshell into
memory, the dropper searches for and kills the java.exe process that is currently running the
ServiceDesk Plus service. After killing the Java process, the process is automatically
restarted by ServiceDesk Plus, which effectively loads the webshell filter into Tomcat. The
dropper finishes by moving itself to RunAsManager.exe within the current directory, which the
ServiceDesk application specifically sets to ManageEngine\ServiceDesk\site24x7 when
executing msiexec.exe using Java's ProcessBuilder API.

Godzilla Webshell
While the threat actor used the same webshell secret key – 5670ebd1f8f3f716 – that was
previously seen in the attacks on ADSelfService Plus, the Godzilla webshell used in this
attack was not a single Java Server Pages (JSP) file as seen before. Rather, the webshell
was installed as an Apache Tomcat Java Servlet Filter. According to Tomcat’s
documentation, these Tomcat Filters allow for the filtering of inbound requests or outbound
responses. In this particular case, this allows the actor to filter inbound requests to determine
which requests are meant for the webshell.
The fact that this Godzilla webshell is installed as a filter means that there is no specific URL
that the actor will send their requests to when interacting with the webshell, and the Godzilla
webshell filter can also bypass a security filter that is present in ServiceDesk Plus to stop
access to webshell files.

6/10

It appears that the threat actor leveraged publicly available code called tomcat-backdoor to
build the filter and then added a modified Godzilla webshell to it. The use of a publicly
available tool with documentation written in Chinese fits the actor’s prior tactics, techniques
and procedures (TTPs). For example, we previously saw this in the Godzilla and NGLite
tools used by the actor to attack ADSelfService Plus. The publicly available tomcat-backdoor
source code provided the actors a codebase which they then modified by removing the
default code that would run commands from inbound requests with custom code that used
the Godzilla webshell.

Figure 3b. Publicly available tomcat-backdoor

7/10

In order to make the Godzilla webshell work under the filter environment, the threat actor
made a few changes to the webshell code as well as, we believe, the webshell controller. For
example, the Tomcat filter does not support the HttpSession object. Thus, HttpSession
methods in Godzilla webshell were replaced with HttpServletRequest request and response.
Also, to identify requests to interact with Godzilla, the tomcat-postgres.jar filter looks for
inbound POST requests with a parameter jsessionsid. After identifying inbound requests to
the webshell, the filter will look for parameters named j_username to obtain the Godzilla
webshell command’s functional code and j_password to access the parameters for the
functional code.

Vulnerable Systems
Recent scans by the Palo Alto Networks Cortex Xpanse platform identified over 4,700
internet-exposed systems running the ServiceDesk Plus software globally. Across the global
population, we also determined that roughly 2,900 – or 62% – of systems are running
vulnerable or unpatched versions of the software. The largest population of vulnerable
systems was found in the U.S., followed by India, Russia, Great Britain and Turkey.

Table 1. Global dispersion of vulnerable ServiceDesk Plus systems.

As of publication, within the U.S., we identified over 1,200 systems running ServiceDesk Plus
software. Roughly 600 – or 50% – of the systems are running vulnerable or unpatched
versions of the software. In characterizing this vulnerable population, we found systems
8/10

falling across all industry segments, including 23 universities, 14 state or local governments,
and 10 healthcare organizations.

Conclusion
Over the course of three months, a persistent and determined APT actor has launched
multiple campaigns which have resulted in compromises to at least 13 organizations. Several
of the impacted organizations fall across U.S. critical infrastructure sectors, including
defense, transportation, healthcare and energy.
The actor's first campaign leveraged a zero-day vulnerability in Zoho ManageEngine
ADSelfService Plus software. In late October, the actor launched its most recent campaign,
which shifted focus toward a previously undisclosed vulnerability in Zoho ManageEngine
ServiceDesk Plus software (CVE-2021-44077). Upon exploiting this vulnerability, the actor
uploaded a new dropper that deployed a Godzilla webshell on victim networks with capability
to bypass a security filter on ADSelfService and ServiceDesk Plus products.
Globally there are over 4,700 internet facing instances of ServiceDesk Plus, of which 2,900 –
or 62% – are assessed to be vulnerable to exploitation. Given the actor's success to date
and continued reconnaissance activities against a variety of industries (including
infrastructure associated with five US states), we anticipate the number of victims will
continue to climb.
We encourage all organizations to patch vulnerable software in their environments.

Protections and Mitigations
The best defense against this evolving campaign is a security posture that favors prevention.
We recommend that organizations implement the following:
1. Identify all Zoho software and ensure the latest patches/upgrades have been applied.
2. Evaluate the business need and risk associated with any internet-facing Zoho products.
3. Review all files that have been created in ServiceDesk Plus directories since early
October 2021.
