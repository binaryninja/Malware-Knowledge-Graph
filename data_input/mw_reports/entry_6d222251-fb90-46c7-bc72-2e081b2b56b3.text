FireEye: Operation Quantum Entanglement

In the realm of quantum mechanics, entanglement
is a peculiar phenomenon in which a pair of
particles takes on the properties of each other,
regardless of the distance between them. Albert
Einstein best described this intertwining
phenomenon as “spooky action at a distance”1.
This behavior is analogous to the observed
correlation between the two geographically
separated attack groups detailed in this paper.
We have uncovered two distinct attack campaigns
originating from different geographic regions in
China using similar tools, techniques and
procedures (TTPs). In both campaigns, each attack
group employed multiple overlapping TTPs to
infiltrate their targets, including similar custom
built backdoors and remote administration tools
(RATs) such as CT/NewCT, Mongall and Nflog
(and publicly available RATs such as PoisonIvy) to
maintain access to victim networks. We also
observed the use of another custom backdoor
called Sysget/HelloBridge by one of the attack
groups, which we believe is possibly shared
between the campaigns as well. Both groups were
also used a well-known proxy tool named HTRAN,
which is an abbreviation for “HUC Packet
Transmit Tool”2 . This tool proxies connections
through intermediate hops and aids the attackers
in disguising their true geographical location when
interacting with the victim networks. We also
observed both attack groups using similar
techniques to evade detection by security

products. In sum, we believe that these groups are
from two distinct regions in China and possibly (1)
are collaborating , (2) received the same training,
(3) have a common toolkit supply chain, or some
combination of these three.
The relationship between the two attack groups
may be direct or indirect, but based on our
current visibility, they seem to have two distinct
missions, with each one targeting different
industries. We were able to ascertain the
geographical locations of the two attack groups
by analyzing their “HTRAN” infrastructure over
a period of time. We believe a separate third
group may also be employing these tools, but
we do not have sufficient insight in to this
additional group at this time.
The attack group “Moafee” (named after their
command and control infrastructure) appears
to operate out of the Guangdong province in
China and is known to target the governments
and military organizations of countries with
national interests in the South China Sea. The
seas in this region have multiple claims of
sovereignty and hold high significance, as it is
the second busiest sea-lane in the world 3 and
are known to be rich in resources such as rare
earth metals 4 , crude oil, and natural gas 5. We
have also observed the Moafee group target
organizations within the US defense
industrial base.

FireEye: Operation Quantum Entanglement

The attack group “DragonOK” (named after an
event name in one of their payload executables 6)
appears to operate out of the Jiangsu province
in China, and is known to target high-tech and
manufacturing companies in Japan and Taiwan.
The propensity to target these industries
possibly demonstrates an interest in gaining
economic competitive advantage in the region
through the acquisition of trade secrets .

using the appropriate language for each of their
targets in the phishing emails– such as Japanese
and traditional Chinese (mainly used in Taiwan).
The attachments in the email were typically an
executable file embedded in a ZIP archive or
password-protected Microsoft Office documents.
One such email, shown in Figure 2 and used by the
DragonOK group was written in traditional
Chinese, and targeted a Taiwanese technology firm

Attack Methodology:

Decoy Behavior
We observed both attack groups employ decoy
documents in order to help deceive potential
victims. The decoy documents are presented to
the victim while the malware runs in the
background. One such Japanese-language decoy
documents used by the “DragonOK” group is

Attack vector:
The primary observed attack vector used by both
groups is spear-phishing emails. The themes--or
topics—used in the emails from the DragonOK
group were well crafted and highly tailored to the
target audience. We also found this attack group

large file sizes, and password-protected
documents – each of which are described in the
sections below.

Evasion Techniques:
Both attack groups employ numerous, yet
common techniques in an attempt to evade
detection by various sandbox environments,
antivirus (AV) software, and gateway firewalls. We
observed environment-based evasion, the use of

CPU Core Check
The first-stage payload for RATs called “CT/
NewCT” used by both the Moafee and
DragonOK attack groups employs an evasive
“CPU core check” technique. The payload
attempts to detect the number of processor

FireEye: Operation Quantum Entanglement

cores in the running environment, by calling the
"GetSystemInfo" API, which returns a structure
with system data, including number of cores. If
only one core is detected, it quits as seen in
Figure 5. This probably is an attempt to detect
virtualized environments such as sandboxes, as

Figure 3:

document
presented to the
victim during a
DragonOK phishing
attack

6 www.fireeye.com

well as other analysis environments used by
reverse engineers, which often tend to be
configured with a single core.
We also observed a similar evasion technique
within the “Sysget/HelloBridge” payload

FireEye: Operation Quantum Entanglement

Figure 4:
Structure returned by
GetSystemInfo API

employed by the DragonOK group. It invokes
a similar call to “GetSystemInfo” to
determine the number of active CPU cores,
and the code quits if the system is configured
with only one core.
Password Protected Documents:
The “DragonOK” group in particular is known
to use password-protected documents
delivered as attachments in emails, with the

password listed in the contents of the email.
This method probably is used to evade
detection by AV software, gateway firewalls
and malware sandboxes. One such example
using the password “888888” is shown in
Figure 2 and Figure 6, and has been observed
by FireEye 7 before. Another similar sample
was referenced by the “contagio” blog 8 and
used the password “8861”.

Large files:
In older phishing emails that link to the tools
used by DragonOK and Moafee, we observed
an implant over 10 megabytes in size. It was
padded with unnecessary null bytes in the

8 www.fireeye.com

overlay section of the file, in order to increase
the file size as shown in Figure 7. This probably
was done to evade detection, as many hostbased and network-based AV engines do not
have the ability to scan large files.

Backdoor and RAT Tools:
CT/NewCT
Dropper:
This is a first stage payload that drops and runs the
NewCT implant. The first stage payload (example:
46e55cdf507ef10b11d74dad6af8b94e)
attempts to detect the number of CPU cores in the

9 www.fireeye.com

running environment by calling GetSystemInfo
as described in the previous section. If the CPU
core check detects more than one core, it implants
the NewCT2 RAT in %temp%\MSSoap.DLL
(some variants will use BurnDCSrv.DLL and
IntelAMTPP.DLL) and executes the written file.
The actual implant is packaged in the resource
section of the dropper with a fake bitmap (BMP)
header, as shown in Figure 8.

FireEye: Operation Quantum Entanglement

Figure 8:
DLL implant
embedded in
resource section with
a fake BMP header

The implant also creates a registry entry file called
named “Windows.reg” and imports it the
contents of this file into the registry, using the
command: “regedit.exe /s Windows.reg”.

Figure 9:

DWORD dwMajorVersion;
DWORD dwMinorVersion;
DWORD dwBuildNumber;
DWORD dwPlatformId;
TCHAR szCSDVersion[128];
} OSVERSIONINFO;

10 www.fireeye.com

These registry entries ensure startup persistence.
The contents of "Windows.reg" is populated based
on the Operating System (OS) which is determined
by a call to the GetVersionEx API.
If “dwBuildNumber” is equal to 2 (VER_
PLATFORM_WIN32_NT) and “dwMajorVersion” is
less than 6 (prior to Windows Vista) it adds
following entry for persistence:
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{fbeb8a05beee-4442-804e-409d6c4515e9}\
InProcServer32]
@="%Temp%\MSSoap.DLL"
Otherwise it creates a copy of itself to %Temp%\
WmiPrvSer.exe and creates the following entry
for persistence:
HKCU \Software\Microsoft\Windows\
CurrentVersion\Run\"dllhost" =
%Temp%\WmiPrvSer.exe

FireEye: Operation Quantum Entanglement

We also found some clues in the binary that
indicate that the tool was authored and built by
someone using Chinese fonts on their computer. It
contains resource strings in English but the
language is set to Chinese as shown below.

Implant
The implant (example:
ccff6e0a6f5e7715bdaf62adf0cbed4f) is
called “NewCT/CT” RAT. The particular version we
analyzed was NewCT version 2. The implant has
persistence mechanisms and contains functionality
to perform command and control communication.
This backdoor also has functionality to load
additional plugins from the command and control
server. It exports the following two functions:
SendData
CreateInstance
It creates a mutex “HFRM_” to ensure there is only
one running copy of the backdoor. It ensures this
by checking if the return value from
CreateMutexA is 183 (\xB7), which
corresponds to “ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS”9.
The payload emits the “POST” network beacon
shown below along with stub data. The header
values are hardcoded in the payload, specifically
the values for “User-Agent”, “Cache-Control” and
the bytes at offset 0 of the stub (\xcf\xcf) may be
of interest to network defenders.

The POST stub contains encrypted data. The
encrypted data has two layers of abstraction. It is
subjected to a bitwise NOT operation followed by
encryption using a randomly generated 4-byte
XOR key. The data within the POST stub is
constructed in a buffer with a header at offset 0 (\
x30\x30) followed by the remote sever, remote
port, XOR encrypted data and function call
location. The function call location is represented
by the textual values shown in the table below and
is selected using a switch case statement as shown
in Figure 12. It is used by the attacker to track the
call path that resulted in the network beacon. The
XOR encrypted data contains the MAC Address,
hostname and campaign code.

To elucidate the encryption scheme, let us go over a sample decryption process. The Figures 13 and 14
below shows data before and after a bitwise NOT operation.

In the resulting data after NOT operation, the XOR key is \x30\x30\x34\x31. When applied to the hex
data following it, we get the decrypted data below, which contains the MAC Address, hostname, and
campaign code. The Python routine to perform this decryption is included in Appendix A

We observed plugin functionality in the implant. It has the ability to load a DLL downloaded from the
remote server, and calls the following export functions in the DLL:
Plugin_GetID
Plugin_Init
Plugins_Start
Plugin_End

The call graph for this functionality is shown in

NewCT RAT evolved from older versions called
“CT”, which has been observed being used in
association with the “Nflog” Backdoor. The
following password-protected document
(46ac122183c32858581e95ef40bd31b3)
creates a DLL implant called IntelAMTPP.dll
(ebd1f5e471774bb283de44e121efa3e5),
which is the “CT” RAT. In this case, the “CT” implant
is 10 MB in size, as it has padded null bytes at the
end of the file to increase file size in a possible
attempt to evade AV engines as described in the
previous section on evasion techniques. The “CT”
implant has identical functionality to “NewCT”, as
observed from the embedded strings.

This version was called “CT V2.1” by the author,
which may indicate that there were other earlier
versions of this RAT and that it was improved
upon incrementally. One of the command and
control servers used by a variant of this implant
is aptly named “ct.datangcun[.]com”. We
do not believe either Moafee or DragonOK have
controlled the domain “ct.datangcun[.]
com”, but it was probably controlled by a third
group which also used the implant in a separate
campaign. The network beacon for version 2.1 is
shown below; it uses the same encryption
scheme as “NewCT”:

We also observed both attack groups using
campaign codes within this implant and which
are listed in Appendix B. The campaign codes referred to victim countries, attack dates, command
and control infrastructure, and other operational
codes – which remain undeciphered.
Nflog
We have observed DragonOK and Moafee use
the Nflog implant in addition to an earlier
version of the NewCT2 implant. The password-protected XLS document (46ac122183c32858581e95ef40bd31b3) referenced earlier also drops an “Nflog” implant
(a3d3b0686e7bd13293ad0e63ebec67af)

communication function code, as well as the data collection function code shown in Figure 17. This
strongly suggests that it is an updated version of the “Nflog” backdoor.

Sysget/HelloBridge
This tool has recently been analyzed by Secureworks 10. We observed the DragonOK attacker
employ this tool against targets in Japan and
Taiwan (e.g. 57e3d002542e07f2eb09fd2b1b0eeab2), as also noted by Secureworks. We have
not yet seen the Moafee group use this tool. This
implant has the following beacon format:

PoisonIvy
This is a publicly available RAT used by multiple
threat actors, which has been extensively analyzed
in a previous FireEye white paper12. The extracted configuration blocks from a "DragonOK"
PoisonIvy variant (65fcc9b9ff608801edc697552438cfee), is shown below:

FireEye has previously analyzed this backdoor11,
which is used by multiple other groups in addition
to DragonOK and Moafee. DragonOK in particular is known to frequently use this implant (e.g.

national interests in the South China Sea. We have
also observed this group target companies within
the US defense industrial base.
As discussed, we have observed the Moafee group
use a number of different tools including Poison
Ivy, Nflog, Mongall, and NewCT2.
We found this group running HTRAN on one of
their front-end command and control servers. The

During this same time frame, the HTRAN client
at 58.64.201.229 was observed
attempting to connect to a number of different
backend HTRAN servers. All of these HTRAN
servers were located in the Guangdong
Province and operated by CHINANET.
Additionally, the Moafee group also hosted a

FireEye: Operation Quantum Entanglement

and July 1, 2012, the phi.crabance[.]com domain
resolved to 98.126.91.66. This IP was
observed hosting a HTRAN proxy client, which
was seen connecting to a backend HTRAN server
hosted at 113.66.248.60. This server was also
located in the Guangdong Province and operated
by CHINANET.
In short, the Moafee group was observed
consistently hosting their backend HTRAN
servers in Guangdong. This observation may
reveal that the Moafee group is physically located
in this province.
Campaign #2: DragonOK
We have observed the DragonOK group
target high-technology and manufacturing
companies in both Japan and Taiwan. This
group has used similar malware to the Moafee
group described above. Specifically, we
observed DragonOK employing PoisonIvy,

Nflog, Mongall, CT, and NewCT.
Like the Moafee group, we observed the
DragonOK group running an HTRAN proxy
client on one of their front-end command
and control servers. For approximately one
week, between July 31, 2013 and August 8,
2013, the domain www.ndbssh[.]com served
as a command and control server for
Mongall payloads distributed by the
DragonOK group. During this time,
DragonOK also ran an HTRAN proxy client
on www.ndbssh[.]com.
This HTRAN client was seen attempting to
connect to three different HTRAN servers
located in the Jiangsu province and operated
by CHINANET.
The domain www.ndbssh[.]com resolved to

FireEye: Operation Quantum Entanglement

Conclusion

•

Usage of the same custom backdoors and
RATs such as CT/NewCT/NewCT2,
Mongall, Nflog, as well as off-the-shelf
RATs such as PoisonIvy, to maintain access
to the victims’ networks.

•

Usage of HTRAN to proxy their command
and control communication.

•

Usage of the same evasion techniques to
evade detection such as environment
checks based on CPU cores, password
protected documents, and the use of large
null padded files.

Based on the geolocation evidence provided
in this paper, it appears that different
operators executed the Moafee and
DragonOK campaigns. This conclusion is
supported by the following assessments:
•

•

The campaigns target different industries in
different geographic locations. The Moafee
campaign targets government and military
organizations in countries with national
interests in the South China Sea. In contrast,
the DragonOK campaign has been observed
targeting high-technology and manufacturing
companies in Japan and Taiwan.
The campaigns maintain separate back-end
command and control infrastructures hosted
in different provinces in Mainland China. The
Moafee campaign can be traced to
infrastructure located in the Guangdong
province, whereas the DragonOK campaign
can be traced to infrastructure located in the
Jiangsu province.

While it seems that different operators are
responsible for these two campaigns, our
research showed that these operators share a
number of common tools, techniques and
procedures (TTPs). We also believe a separate
third group is using these TTPs but we do not
have sufficient insight to this operator at this
time. The shared TTPs include:

http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh849687.aspx
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh847739.aspx

We assess that these shared TTPs may be the
result of:
•

A direct relationship between the operators.

•

An indirect relationship such as the
completion of a common training regimen.

•

A common quartermaster or supply-chain for
their malware tools.
