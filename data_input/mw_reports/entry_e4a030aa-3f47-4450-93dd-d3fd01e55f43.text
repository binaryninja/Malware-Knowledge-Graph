While looking at commodity RATs currently offered on underground
forums, we came across “WebMonitor”, on the market since mid-2017.
We noticed that while detection was high for most anti-virus vendors, all
tagged it with only generic detection. At this point we realized that
although this malware had been around for almost a year, we were
looking at a hitherto-undocumented commodity RAT.
For Sale
Commodity RATs are typically peddled on underground forums and come and go with new
offerings springing up to replace those taken down by law enforcement actions.

Figure 1 – WebMonitor RAT Forum sales thread

We first observed apparent tests of this RAT in late February 2017. In May 2017, “Revcode”
advertises his RAT “WebMonitor” at hackforums[.]net (Figure 1) for €14.99 - €29.99 (Figure
2):
“[#1 Web RAT, CONTROL FROM WEB BROWSER, No PORTFORWARD, KEYLOGGER, +
VPN]”.

In addition to forum sales thread, Revcode’s main sales and support site is at revcode[.] eu
(Figure 3).

Features
On the server-side, WebMonitor offers an included VPN and C2 service (discussed in detail
later in this report), with a web-based interface (Figure 4).

Figure 4 - Web-based C2 interface
WebMonitor offers two interface options: the original “Lite” version, and a slicker interface in
the “Enterprise” version.
A list of features is provided at the site, some of which stretch the guise of a legitimate
administration tool:

A recent development, in January Revcode partner “Softpatch” offers an Android RAT client,
posting the source code at Github.

WebMonitor Client
The WebMonitor client (ie: the RAT) is written in Visual Basic 6 (VB6) and packed with UPX.
It installs to users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\REVCODE-***.EXE,
where **** is a random 4-digit hex value.
For persistence it creates a registry key under
x86: HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
x64:HKCUU\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run) (Figure 5),
similarly appending using the same 4-digit value.

6/15

Figure 5 - Persistence registry key
Along with the C2-as-a-Service, the client builder is designed for ease of use, with a focus on
simplicity. Along with deciding whether a pop-up is displayed – or not – the customer can
decide whether the client should run at startup, and if the process should restart if terminated
(Figure 6).

Figure 6 - Client Builder Interface
Revcode partner (or alternative forum account) attempts to claim legitimacy “We have to
follow the laws and therefore have to display installation dialogs. However, we can't help if
people bypass that by cracking or patching the executable.” But then contradicts himself in
fact, with the builder option to NOT create an installation pop-up, and “The reason why me
made it possible in a way to bypass the dialog is when customers want to update their
clients. We don't find it necessary to reproduce the installation dialogs.”.

C2aaS
As previously seen in Quaverse RAT / QRAT, WebMonitor offers Command-and-Control
(C2)-as-a-Service (C2aas). Customers don’t have to (in fact, can’t) run their own C2 system,
it’s provided for them. WebMonitor C2s to virtual-hostnames, apparently unique to each
customer, at one of two root C2 domains. Although C2 communication is over HTTPS, an
obvious downside to such a C2 domain architecture is that the C2 traffic is easily detected
and blocked based upon the domains.
WebMonitor customers access their C2 web interface via user-specific virtual hostnames at
the host C2s (Figure 7).

7/15

Figure 7 - C2 Virtual Hosts
The original C2 domain was the same as the sales website, revcode[.]eu. In late July 2017, a
second root-C2 was brought online, wm01[.]to (“WebMonitor”).
DNS & Coin Mining
Starting in samples first observed late-November 2017, in addition to DNS lookups for the C2
as described above, the RAT clients also performed multiple lookups for non-existent
domains (Figure 8).

8/15

Figure 8 - NXD and Monero Mining Pool DNS lookups
These take the form <username>.<8_char_hex_value>.to. No domains in any observed
samples using this technique actually exist, and as such the DNS “NXD” (non-existent
domain) response has no obvious C2 function.
It is possible that this is may be a yet-to-be-implemented Domain Generation Algorithm
(DGA) implementation, otherwise possibly a clumsy and ineffectual effort to attempt to
camouflage the genuine C2 DNS lookup among invalid ones.
One of the very first samples observed using this new technique also contacted a Monero
Mining Pool server pool1.minexmr[.]com, as seen in Figure 8 above. This may have been the
9/15

author testing rather than a feature released to his customers, as we only observed this once
in the wild. Monero mining is hardly representative of a feature of a “legitimate remote
administration utility”.
RAT Customers and Targets
Revcode[.]eu is observed being used less often in recent months, in favor of wm01[.]to, with
some samples contacting both. At time of writing, we understand those to be the only two
domains used by WebMonitor’s C2-as-a-Service. Based upon analysis of passive DNS
records, we observed just under 100 virtual hosts under the two domains, giving an
indication of the relatively small number of customers. To date Palo Alto Networks has
collected just over 500 distinct samples of WebMonitor.

Figure 9 - Verticals

The apparently-small number of customers and the “commodity” nature of this malware, with
a modest price tag, might suggest an innocuous threat. However, using AutoFocus, we have
observed over 2000 WebMonitor infection attempts against Palo Alto Networks customers
across multiple verticals (Figure 9), worldwide (Figure 10).

Figure 10 - Global distribution of targets
Author
The domain revcode[.]eu has an in-the-clear, non-anonymized WHOIS (Figure 11). Several
current and historical domains are registered with identical information, some back to 2013.
Research into the information in the WHOIS found corroborating information, identifying a
25-year-old from the state of Bavaria in southern Germany.

Interestingly, while WebMonitor has been marketed since May 2017, there has been no other
formal analysis and write-up in the year that it has been sold. The tongue-in-cheek, Floridabased blogger “Krabs on Security” offers an analysis, but this hasn’t been picked up by
mainstream malware researchers. She opines “a very very legal malware backed by a .eu
domain and a very very long Term of Service that was used in CEO Fraud, as seen below.
Who would’ve thought such legal software being advertised on the benign forums dubbed
“HackForums” would be used for such notorious cybercriminal purposes?”. “Revcode”
partner “SoftPatch” seemed slighted and was quick to attack this analysis, pointing out in a
forum post (Figure 12) multiple apparent inaccuracies.

And Revcode himself, despite the usual attempts at pretense-of-legitimacy seen in
Commodity RAT sales, markets features that have no utility for legitimate use: “perfectly
compatible with all crypters and protectors”, “Privacy is our priority, so no logs are saved on
our servers.”. Revcode partner (or alternative forum account” posts an exhaustive list of

Summary
The feature set of this RAT would afford an attacker significant access to and control of a
victim. Fortunately, owing to the “C2aaS” model employed, detection of and prevention
against WebMonitor C2 traffic is trivial. Webmonitor’s addition to the list of currentlymarketed commodity RATs demonstrates their continued popularity, enabling successful
attacks even in the hands of the unsophisticated attacker.
We predict that WebMonitor won’t last much longer, at least not with this model as the C2s
are too easily identified/blocked. Indeed, another aspect of this centralized model, having the
hosted service create each client for customers, might put the author’s hands on every one
of the malware samples in the eyes of the law.
Coverage
Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from this threat in the following ways:
1. WildFire accurately identifies WebMonitor RAT samples as malicious.
2. Traps prevents this threat on endpoints, based upon WildFire prevention.
3. WebMonitor root C2 domains are flagged as malicious in Threat Prevention.
AutoFocus users can view WebMonitor RAT samples using the “WebMonitorRAT” tag.
IOCs can be found in the appendices of this report.
