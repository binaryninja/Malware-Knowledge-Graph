Indicators of Compromise Associated with Cuba
Ransomware
Summary
The FBI has identified, as of early November 2021 that Cuba ransomware actors have
compromised at least 49 entities in five critical infrastructure sectors, including but not limited
to the financial, government, healthcare, manufacturing, and information technology sectors.
Cuba ransomware is distributed through Hancitor malware, a loader known for dropping or
executing stealers, such as Remote Access Trojans (RATs) and other types of ransomware, onto
victims’ networks. Hancitor malware actors use phishing emails, Microsoft Exchange
vulnerabilities, compromised credentials, or legitimate Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) tools to
gain initial access to a victim’s network. Subsequently, Cuba ransomware actors use legitimate
Windows services—such as PowerShell, PsExec, and other unspecified services—and then
leverage Windows Admin privileges to execute their ransomware and other processes
remotely. Cuba ransomware actors compromise a victim network through the encryption of
target files with the “.cuba” extension. Cuba ransomware actors have demanded at least US
$74 million and received at least US $43.9 million in ransom payments.

Technical Details
Cuba ransomware, upon compromise, installs and executes a CobaltStrike beacon as a service
on the victim’s network via PowerShell. Once installed, the ransomware downloads two
executable files, which include “pones.exe” for password acquisition and “krots.exe,” also
known as KPOT, enabling the Cuba ransomware actors to write to the compromised system’s
temporary (TMP) file. Once the TMP file is uploaded, the “krots.exe” file is deleted and the TMP
file is executed in the compromised network. The TMP file includes Application Programming
Interface (API) calls related to memory injection that, once executed, deletes itself from the
system. Upon deletion of the TMP file, the compromised network begins communicating with a
reported malware repository located at Montenegro-based Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
teoresp.com.
Further, Cuba ransomware actors use MimiKatz malware to steal credentials, and then use RDP
to log into the compromised network host with a specific user account. Once an RDP
connection is complete, the Cuba ransomware actors use the CobaltStrike server to
communicate with the compromised user account. One of the initial PowerShell script
functions allocates memory space to run a base64-encoded payload. Once this payload is
loaded into memory, it can be used to reach the remote command-and-control (C2) server and
then deploy the next stage of files for the ransomware. The remote C2 server is located at the
malicious URL kurvalarva.com

Sample Cuba Ransom Note, as of Mid-October 2021
Good day. All your files are encrypted. For decryption contact us.
Write here iracomp3@protonmail.com
We also inform that your databases, ftp server and file server were downloaded by us to our servers.
* Do not rename encrypted files
* Do not try to decrypto your data using third party software,
it may cause permanent data loss.

Information Requested:
The FBI is seeking any information that can be shared, to include boundary logs showing
communication to and from foreign IP addresses, Bitcoin wallet information, the decryptor file,
and/or a benign sample of an encrypted file. The FBI does not encourage paying ransoms.
Payment does not guarantee files will be recovered. It may also embolden adversaries to target

additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of
ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. However, the FBI understands that when victims are
faced with an inability to function, all options are evaluated to protect shareholders, employees
and customers. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the
ransom, the FBI urges you to promptly report ransomware incidents to your local field office.
Doing so provides the FBI with critical information needed to prevent future attacks by
identifying and tracking ransomware attackers and holding them accountable under US law.

Recommended Mitigations:
FBI recommends network defenders to apply the following mitigations to reduce the risk of
compromise by Cuba ransomware:









Require all accounts with password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and
domain admin accounts) to have strong, unique passwords. Passwords should not be
reused across multiple accounts or stored on the system where an adversary may have
access. Note: Devices with local administrative accounts should implement a password
policy that requires strong, unique passwords for each individual administrative
account.
Require multi-factor authentication for all services to the extent possible, particularly
for webmail, virtual private networks, and accounts that access critical systems.
Keep all operating systems and software up to date. Timely patching is one of the most
efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to
cybersecurity threats.
Remove unnecessary access to administrative shares, especially ADMIN$ and C$. If
ADMIN$ and C$ are deemed operationally necessary, restrict privileges to only the
necessary service or user accounts and perform continuous monitoring for anomalous
activity.
Use a host-based firewall to only allow connections to administrative shares via server
message block (SMB) from a limited set of administrator machines.

Adversaries use system and network discovery techniques for network and system visibility and
mapping. To limit an adversary from learning the organization’s enterprise environment, limit
common system and network discovery techniques by taking the following actions:




Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can
help prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and
access to—various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement.
Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the
indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the
ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral

TLP:WHITE

movement activity on a network. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools are
particularly useful for detecting lateral connections as they have insight into common
and uncommon network connections for each host.
Implement time-based access for accounts set at the admin level and higher. For
example, the Just-in-Time (JIT) access method provisions privileged access when needed
and can support enforcement of the principle of least privilege (as well as the Zero Trust
model). This is a process where a network-wide policy is set in place to automatically
disable admin accounts at the AD level when the account is not in direct need. When
the account is needed, individual users submit their requests through an automated
process that enables access to a system, but only for a set timeframe to support task
completion.
Disable command-line and scripting activities and permissions. Privilege escalation and
lateral movement often depend on software utilities that run from the command line. If
threat actors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating
privileges and/or moving laterally.
Maintain offline backups of data, and regularly maintain backup and restoration. This
practice will ensure the organization will not be severely interrupted, have irretrievable
data.
Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and
covers the entire organization’s data infrastructure.
