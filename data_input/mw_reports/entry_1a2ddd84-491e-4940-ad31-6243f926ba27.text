NOBELIUM targeting delegated administrative privileges
to facilitate broader attacks
microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/10/25/nobelium-targeting-delegated-administrative-privileges-to-facilitate-broaderattacks/
October 25, 2021

The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) has detected nation-state activity
associated with the threat actor tracked as NOBELIUM, attempting to gain access to
downstream customers of multiple cloud service providers (CSP), managed service
providers (MSP), and other IT services organizations (referred to as “service providers” for
the rest of this blog) that have been granted administrative or privileged access by other
organizations. The targeted activity has been observed against organizations based in the
United States and across Europe since May 2021. MSTIC assesses that NOBELIUM has
launched a campaign against these organizations to exploit existing technical trust
relationships between the provider organizations and the governments, think tanks, and
other companies they serve. NOBELIUM is the same actor behind the SolarWinds
compromise in 2020, and this latest activity shares the hallmarks of the actor’s compromiseone-to-compromise-many approach. Microsoft has notified known victims of these activities

1/11

through our nation-state notification process and worked with them and other industry
partners to expand our investigation, resulting in new insights and disruption of the threat
actor throughout stages of this campaign.
Microsoft has observed NOBELIUM targeting privileged accounts of service providers to
move laterally in cloud environments, leveraging the trusted relationships to gain access to
downstream customers and enable further attacks or access targeted systems. These
attacks are not the result of a product security vulnerability but rather a continuation of
NOBELIUM’s use of a diverse and dynamic toolkit that includes sophisticated malware,
password sprays, supply chain attacks, token theft, API abuse, and spear phishing to
compromise user accounts and leverage the access of those accounts. These attacks have
highlighted the need for administrators to adopt strict account security practices and take
additional measures to secure their environments.
In the observed supply chain attacks, downstream customers of service providers and other
organizations are also being targeted by NOBELIUM. In these provider/customer
relationships, customers delegate administrative rights to the provider that enable the
provider to manage the customer’s tenants as if they were an administrator within the
customer’s organization. By stealing credentials and compromising accounts at the service
provider level, NOBELIUM can take advantage of several potential vectors, including but not
limited to delegated administrative privileges (DAP), and then leverage that access to extend
downstream attacks through trusted channels like externally facing VPNs or unique providercustomer solutions that enable network access. To reduce the potential impact of this
NOBELIUM activity, Microsoft encourages all of our partners and customers to immediately
review the guidance below and implement risk mitigations, harden environments, and
investigate suspicious behaviors that match the tactics described in this blog. MSTIC
continues to observe, monitor, and notify affected customers and partners through our
nation-state notification process. Microsoft Detection and Response Team (DART) and
Microsoft Threat Experts have also engaged directly with affected customers to assist with
incident response and drive better detection and guidance around this activity.

Post-exploitation patterns against downstream targets
A key trait of NOBELIUM’s ongoing activity over the last year has been the abuse of indirect
paths and trust relationships to target and gain access to victims of interest for intelligence
gain. In the most recent campaign, this has manifested in a compromise-one-to-compromisemany approach—exploiting the service providers’ trust chain to gain broad access to multiple
customer tenants for subsequent attacks. NOBELIUM leverages established standard
business practices, to target downstream customers across multiple managed tenants.
These delegated administrative privileges are often neither audited for approved use nor
disabled by a service provider or downstream customer once use has ended, leaving them

2/11

active until removed by the administrators. If NOBELIUM has compromised the accounts tied
to delegated administrative privileges through other credential-stealing attacks, that access
grants actors like NOBELIUM persistence for ongoing campaigns.
In one example intrusion chain observed by MSTIC during this campaign, the actor was
observed chaining together artifacts and access across four distinct providers to reach their
end target. The example demonstrates the breadth of techniques that the actor leverages to
exploit and abuse trust relationships to accomplish their objective.

variety of methods.
Microsoft assesses that organizations, such as cloud service providers and other technology
organizations who manage services on behalf of downstream customers, will be of continued
interest to persistent threat actors and are at risk for targeting via a variety of methods, from
credential access to targeted social engineering via legitimate business processes and
procedures. For additional information on how to identify and triage delegated administrative
privileges, see the mitigations and recommendations below.

Mitigation and remediation

3/11

Microsoft recommends that cloud service providers, other technology organizations with
elevated privileges for customer systems, and all downstream customers of these
organizations review and implement the following actions to help mitigate and remediate the
recent NOBELIUM activity.

If you are a cloud service provider or an organization who relies on elevated
privileges
1. Verify and monitor compliance with Microsoft Partner Center security requirements
All Microsoft partners should review and verify overall compliance status with the partner
security requirements through the Microsoft Partner Center. Microsoft recommends the
following:
1. Ensure multifactor authentication (MFA) is in use and conditional access policies
are enforced: All Microsoft partners are required to use MFA to access Partner Center
and for cross-tenant access to customer tenants in Microsoft commercial clouds.
Partners are advised to check their security compliance in Partner Center and monitor
if any user logins or API calls are not compliant with MFA enforcement. Partners should
stay compliant at all times.
2. Adopt the Secure Application Model Framework: All partners integrating with
Partner Center APIs must adopt the Secure Application Model framework for any app
and user auth model applications.
3. Check the Partner Center Activity Logs: partners are advised to regularly check the
“Activity Log” in Partner Center to monitor any user activities, including high privileged
user creations, high privileged user role assignment, etc. Partners can also use Partner
Center Activity Log APIs to create a custom security dashboard on key user activities in
Partner Center to proactively detect suspicious activities.
2. Remove delegated administrative privileges (DAP) connection when not in use
To improve security, Microsoft recommends that partners remove delegated administrative
privileges that are no longer in use. Starting in November, a new reporting tool will be
available that identifies and displays all active delegated administrative privilege connections
and will help organizations to discover unused delegated administrative privileges
connections. This tool will provide reporting that captures how partner agents are accessing
customer tenants through those privileges and will allow partners to remove the connection
when not in use.

4/11

1. We are offering service providers a free two year subscription of Azure Active
Directory Premium Plan 2 to further help them manage and get reports on access
privileges. Registered partners can log onto Partner Center to take advantage of this
offer. Azure AD Premium Plan 2 provides extended access to sign-in logs and premium
features such as Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) and risk-based
Conditional Access capabilities to strengthen security controls.
3. Conduct a thorough investigation and comprehensive response.
Carry out additional investigations if you think you might have been affected to determine the
full scope of compromised users/assets. Microsoft recommends the following:
1. Review the Azure AD Security Operations Guide to audit or establish your
security operations. If you are a cloud service provider or an organization that relies
on elevated privileges, you need to assess the security implications in your network
and its connectivity for your customers. In particular, review authentications that are
associated with Azure AD configuration changes using the Microsoft 365 compliance
center (formerly in the Exchange admin center) or Azure AD admin logs.
2. Adequate log retention procedures for cloud-based resources are critical to
effectively identify, respond to, and remediate malicious activity. Cloud service
providers and other technology organizations often configure individual subscriptions to
meet specific customer requirements. These configurations might not include security
controls that enable full accountability to administrative actions should an incident
occur. We encourage all organizations to become familiar with logs made available
within your subscription and routinely evaluate them for adequacy and anomalies.
3. General Incident response playbooks for Phishing and Password spray are available in
Microsoft Security Best Practices.

If you are a downstream customer
1. Review, audit, and minimize access privileges and delegated permissions
It is important to consider and implement a least-privilege approach. Microsoft recommends
prioritizing a thorough review and audit of partner relationships to minimize any unnecessary
permissions between your organization and upstream providers. Microsoft recommends
immediately removing access for any partner relationships that look unfamiliar or have not
yet been audited.

5/11

1. Review, harden, and monitor all tenant administrator accounts: All organizations
should thoroughly review all tenant admin users, including those associated with
Administer On Behalf Of (AOBO) in Azure subscriptions and verify the authenticity of
the users and activity. We strongly encourage the use of strong authentication for all
tenant administrators, review of devices registered for use with MFA, and minimize the
use of standing high-privilege access. Continue to reinspect all active tenant admin
users accounts and check audit logs on a regular basis to verify that high-privilege user
access is not granted or delegated to admin users who do not require these to do their
job.
2. Review service provider permissions access from B2B and local accounts: In
addition to using the delegated administrative privilege capabilities, some cloud service
providers use business-to-business (B2B) accounts or local administrator accounts in
customer tenants. We recommend that you identify whether your cloud service
providers use these, and if so, ensure those accounts are well-governed, and have
least-privilege access in your tenant. Microsoft recommends against the use of
“shared” administrator accounts. Review the detailed guidance on how to review
permissions for B2B accounts.
2. Verify multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled and enforce conditional access
policies
MFA is the best baseline security hygiene method to protect against threats. Follow the
detailed guidance on setting up multifactor authentication in Microsoft 365, as well as the
guidance on deploying and configuring conditional access policies in Azure Active Directory
(Azure AD).
3. Review and audit logs and configurations
1. Review and audit Azure AD sign-ins and configuration changes: Authentications of
this nature are audited and available to customers through the Azure AD sign in logs,
Azure AD audit logs, and the Microsoft 365 compliance center (formerly in the
Exchange Admin Center). We recently added the capability to see sign-ins by partners
who have delegated admin permissions. You can see a filtered view of these sign-ins
by navigating to the sign-in logs in the Azure AD admin portal, and adding a filter
‘Cross-tenant access type: Service provider’ on the ‘User-sign ins (non-interactive)’ tab.

6/11

2. Review Existing Log Availability and Retention Strategies: Investigating activities
conducted by malicious actors places a large emphasis on having adequate log
retention procedures for cloud-based resources including Office 365. Various
subscription levels have individualized log availability and retention policies which are
important to understand prior to forming an incident response procedure.
We encourage all organizations to become familiar with logs made available within your
subscription and routinely evaluate them for adequacy and anomalies. For organizations
relying on a third-party organization, work with them to understand their logging strategy for
all administrative actions and establish a process should logs need to be made available
during an incident.

Observed behaviors and TTPs
Unique indicators (e.g., specific IPs, domains, hashes) have limited value in detecting global
NOBELIUM activity because the indicators are mostly compartmented by campaign and
specific to the targeted organization. They also regularly obfuscate their attack by shifting
infrastructure and maintain very tight operational security around their campaigns. Despite
this, the following behaviors and characteristics are common to NOBELIUM intrusions and
should be reviewed closely during investigations to help determine if an organization has
been affected:
NOBELIUM leverages “anonymous” infrastructure, which may include low reputation
proxy services, cloud hosting services, and TOR, to authenticate to victims
NOBELIUM has been observed leveraging scripted capabilities, including but not
limited to RoadTools or AADInternals, to conduct enumeration of Azure AD, which can
result in authentication with user agents of scripting environments
NOBELIUM has been observed authenticating to accounts from anomalous locations
that might trigger impossible travel analytics or fail to pass deployed conditional access
policies.
NOBELIUM has been observed modifying Azure AD to enable long-term persistence
and access to sensitive information. This can include the creation of users, consent of
Azure AD applications, granting of roles to users and applications, creation of
additional service principal credentials, and more. More information at
https://aka.ms/nobelium.
In one incident, MSTIC observed the use of Azure RunCommand, paired with Azure
admin-on-behalf-of (AOBO), as a technique to gain access to virtual machines and shift
access from cloud to on-premise.
NOBELIUM has demonstrated an ongoing interest in targeting privileged users,
including Global Administrators. Security of at-risk organizations is greatly enhanced by
prioritizing events that are detected on privileged accounts.

7/11

NOBELIUM is frequently observed conducting activities consistent with intelligence
collection. Routinely monitoring various log sources for anomalies consistent with data
exfiltration can serve as an early warning for compromise.
Organizations previously targeted by NOBELIUM might experience recurring activity
and would benefit from implementing proactive monitoring for new attacks.

Detection and Investigation through Advanced Hunting queries
For Microsoft customers using Azure Sentinel, Microsoft 365 Defender, Microsoft Cloud App
Security, or registered partners taking advantage of the free two year subscription of Azure
Active Directory Premium Plan 2, any of the following in-product detections, investigation
guidance, and hunting queries can help organizations accelerate their investigations into this
activity.

Azure Sentinel
Azure Sentinel customers can use the following detection queries to look for this activity:
Detections
Name: Azure VM Run Command operations executing a unique PowerShell script
Description: This query identifies when the Azure Run command is used to execute a
unique PowerShell script on a virtual machine. The uniqueness of the PowerShell script is
determined by taking a combined hash of the cmdlets it imports and the file size of the
PowerShell script. Alerts from this detection indicate a unique PowerShell was executed in
your environment.
URL: https://github.com/Azure/AzureSentinel/tree/master/Detections/AzureActivity/RareRunCommandPowerShellScript.yaml
Name: Azure VM Run Command operation executed during suspicious login window
Description: This query identifies when the Azure Run command execution event is
associated with a user and IP Address that has recently been associated by an Azure
Sentinel UEBA user entity behavior alert.
URL: https://github.com/Azure/AzureSentinel/tree/master/Detections/MultipleDataSources/RunCommandUEBABreach.yaml
Name: Azure Portal Sign-in from another Azure Tenant
Description: This query looks for sign-in attempts to the Azure Portal where the user who is
signing in from another Azure tenant, and the IP address the login attempt is from is an
Azure IP. A threat actor who compromises an Azure tenant may look to pivot to other tenants
leveraging cross-tenant delegated access in this manner.
URL: https://github.com/Azure/AzureSentinel/tree/master/Detections/SigninLogs/AzurePortalSigninfromanotherAzureTenant.yaml
Hunting Queries
8/11

Name: Azure VM Run Command executed from Azure IP address
Description: This query identifies any Azure VM Run Command operation executed from an
Azure IP address. The Run Command allows an attacker or legitimate user to execute
arbitrary PowerShell on a target VM.
URL: https://github.com/Azure/AzureSentinel/tree/master/Hunting%20Queries/AzureActivity/AzureRunCommandFromAzureIP.ya
ml
Name: Azure VM Run Command linked with MDE
Description: This query identifies any Azure VM Run Command operations and links these
operations with MDE host logging. Logging from AzureActivity provides the IP address and
user name of the account that invoked the command. The MDE data provides insights into
what cmdlets were loaded by the command.
URL: https://github.com/Azure/AzureSentinel/tree/master/Hunting%20Queries/MultipleDataSources/AzureRunCommandMDELink
ed.yaml
Name: Dormant Service Principal Update Creds and Logs In
Description: This query look for Service Principal accounts that are no longer used where a
user has added or updated credentials for them before logging in with the Service Principal.
URL: https://github.com/Azure/AzureSentinel/tree/master/Hunting%20Queries/MultipleDataSources/DormantServicePrincipalUpd
ateCredsandLogsIn.yaml
Name: Dormant User Update MFA and Logs In
Description: This query looks for user accounts that have not been successfully logged into
recently, who then have a MFA method added or updated before logging in.
URL: https://github.com/Azure/AzureSentinel/tree/master/Hunting%20Queries/MultipleDataSources/DormantUserUpdateMFAand
LogsIn.yaml

Microsoft 365 Defender
Microsoft 365 Defender provides detection for one of the cloud persistence techniques
commonly used by NOBELIUM. That persistence technique relies on maintaining access to
victims’ mail system through the modification of permissions and addition of hidden
credentials that allow the attacker to access emails remotely. This alert is based on a
combination of multiple signals and telemetry that originates from Microsoft Cloud App
Security and is triggered either based on the risk score of the account involved or based on
the suspicious IP address used to access emails.

9/11

Detection Name: Suspicious Addition of an Exchange related App Role
Description: Addition of an Exchange related application role was observed. An account
that can authenticate against an application service principal may also be able to access
Exchange data and email. This alert was triggered based on another Microsoft Cloud App
Security alert related to the potentially compromised user account.

Microsoft Cloud Application Security
Review and audit users and accounts and their activities: Microsoft Cloud App Security
provides a quick page to enumerate all the users and accounts but filtering specifically to find
“external” users with admin privilege. Once these users and accounts are identified, Cloud
App Security can assist to review some of the activities performed and recent sign-ins and
risk score.

Microsoft Cloud App Security also provides detection coverage for some of the NOBELIUM
techniques mentioned in earlier sections of this blog, including detection of post-exploitation
activities related to manipulation of privileged credentials and a new detection for passwordspray typically used to obtain initial foothold.
Detection Name: Activity from password-spray associated IP address
Description: This detection compares IP addresses performing successful activities in your
cloud applications to IP addresses identified by Microsoft’s threat intelligence sources as
recently performing password spray attacks. It alerts about users that were victims of
password spray campaigns and managed to access your cloud applications from those
malicious IPs.
Detection Name: Unusual addition of credentials to an OAuth app
Description: This detection identifies the suspicious addition of privileged credentials to an
OAuth app, based on baseline behavior of activities learned by the product. This can indicate
that an attacker has compromised the app, and is using it for malicious activity.
Detection Name: Unusual ISP for an OAuth app
Description: This detection profiles your environment and triggers alerts when OAuth apps
perform activities from an unusual ISP, which could indicate an attempted breach using a
non-genuine OAuth provider.

10/11

Azure Defender
Azure Defender provides detections for abuse of legitimate virtual machine extensions once
an attacker has obtained token or valid credentials. Through deep analysis of Azure activity
logs, Azure Defender analyzes every call made by authenticated and authorized principals
and calculates a likelihood score to determine suspicious intent of the operation and detect it.
Detection Name: Suspicious Run Command invocation detected
Description: Azure Defender for Resource Manager identified a suspicious Run Command
invocation in your subscription. Azure Run Command is a feature designed to allow
administrators to efficiently manage their environments. While this activity may be legitimate,
an attacker with sufficient permissions can utilize Run Command to execute malicious code
on your virtual machine. This activity is deemed suspicious as the user rarely invokes
operations that enable code execution. This can indicate the account is compromised and is
being used with malicious intent.
Microsoft continues to track NOBELIUM’s activities, tactics, malware, and tools. We will
communicate any additional insights and recommendations as we investigate their actions
against our customers. We reinforce the importance of best practice security
precautions such as Zero-trust architecture and multi-factor authentication and
their importance for everyone. Additional information on best practice security
priorities is listed below:
