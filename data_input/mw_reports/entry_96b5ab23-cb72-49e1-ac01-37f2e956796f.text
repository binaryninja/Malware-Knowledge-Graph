Introducing BIOLOAD: FIN7 BOOSTWRITE’s Lost Twin

December 26, 2019

A couple of months ago, enSilo’s endpoint protection platform blocked malicious payloads
running in legitimate Microsoft Windows processes. A deeper look uncovered that the
attacker abused the DLL search order to load their own malicious DLL. Some of the samples
in the environment matched ones described in a recent publication by FireEye about FIN7’s
new tools and techniques, specifically BOOSTWRITE. Comparing the rest of the samples to
BOOSTWRITE revealed they have a common codebase and carry the Carbanak backdoor.

The Abused Target
Windows OS uses a common method to look for required DLLs to load into a program.
Adversaries may use this behavior to cause the program to load a malicious DLL, a
technique known as DLL search order hijacking (or binary planting).
The abused application in this case is FaceFodUninstaller.exe. It exists on a clean OS
installation starting from Windows 10 RS4 (1803) at the
“%WINDR%\System32\WinBioPlugIns” folder. The executable is dependent on winbio.dll,
which is usually found in the parent directory (“%WINDR%\System32”).

What makes this executable even more attractive in the eyes of an attacker is the fact that it
is started from a built-in scheduled task named FODCleanupTask, thereby minimizing the
footprint on the machine and reducing the chances of detection even further. This
demonstrates the group’s ongoing technological research efforts.

BIOLOAD
The loader file name is WinBio.dll (note the uppercase characters) and is placed by the
attacker alongside the executable in the same folder (“WinBioPlugIns"), thus leveraging the
default DLL search order. Because the file path is under %WINDIR%, it means that in order
to plant it the attacker needed to have elevated privileges on the victim’s machine such as
administrator or a SYSTEM account.

Like BOOSTWRITE, this loader was also developed in C++. It exports only a single function
which is the one FaceFodUninstaller.exe imports.
The samples target a 64-bit OS and were compiled in March and July of 2019.
BOOSTWRITE targets 32-bit machines and was compiled (and signed) in May 2019.
According to previous reports on the group, they do not falsify compilation timestamps of the
binaries.
When the DLL is started it checks the number of command line arguments of the process to
decide how to act. When the executable is started by the task scheduler it doesn’t have
command line arguments and the malware works as follows:
1. Creates a log file at %TEMP%\~bio<epoch_time>. Logs are textual and aren’t
encrypted.
2. Starts itself again as a child process with one command line argument comprised of 32
random upper-case letters.
3. Establishes persistency by using COM objects to access the task scheduler. The
malware makes sure the task is enabled, adds a trigger to start it 30 seconds after
Windows boots and does not wait for idle state.
When WinBioGetEnrolledFactors is called, the malware loads the original winbio.dll and
invokes the original function.
The worker process loads and executes the payload DLL in-memory. It starts by creating a
log file at %TEMP%\~wrk<epoch_time>. It then makes sure only a single instance is
currently running by creating a named mutex based on environments variables in this
fashion:
BIOLOAD also has the encrypted payload DLL embedded in it. In contrast to BOOSTWRITE,
it does not support multiple payloads. Furthermore, to decrypt the payload it uses a simple
XOR decryption rather than a ChaCha cipher, nor does it access a remote server to fetch the
key. Instead, BIOLOAD is tailor-made for every machine it infects as it relies on the machine
name to properly derive the decryption key.

The length of the key is 16 bytes and is also embedded in the loader. A portion of the key is
overwritten with the result of MurmurHash3 on the key using a CRC32 checksum of the
computer name as the seed. This hinders detection by sandboxes and obstruct researchers
from analyzing the payload when the relevant context is missing.

The PE loader implementation is the same as the one in BOOSTWRITE. The format of the
log file name is similar as well.

The Carbanak Backdoor
As mentioned, the payload this loader carries is the Carbanak backdoor. The samples we
extracted from BIOLOAD are newer builds of the backdoor, dated January and April of 2019,
according to their timestamps.
One notable addition is that it checks to see if another Anti-Virus (AV) is running on the
machine, besides Kaspersky, AVG and TrendMicro. The result, however, has no effect on the
operations of the backdoor, unlike with previously detected AVs.

Final Thoughts
This is the first public case of FaceFodUninstaller.exe being abused as host process by a
threat actor.
The shared codebase with recent tools attributed to FIN7, together with the same techniques
and backdoor, allows to attribute this new loader to the cybercrime group. The timestamps,
together with simpler functionality, suggest BIOLOAD is a preceding iteration of
BOOSTWRITE.
Since the loader is specifically built for each targeted machine and requires administrative
permissions to deploy, it suggests the group gathers information about its targets’ networks.

Solutions
This malware uses a common, yet stealthy and effective, method to execute its payload in
the context of legitimate processes.
Countermeasures should be in place to detect this malicious behavior. The recently acquired
FortiEDR – an Endpoint Detection and Response solution integrated into FortiGate firewalls,
FortiSIEM and FortiSandbox - detects and blocks such behavior post-infection to help
incident responders quickly mitigate and respond to such threats.
FortiClient detects and blocks the IOCs listed below as W64/Inject.B!tr.spy and
W64/Carbanak.A2EB!tr.
