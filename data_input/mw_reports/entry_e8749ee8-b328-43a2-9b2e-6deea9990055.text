Stuxnet is believed to be a jointly built American-Israeli cyber weapon and computer worm.
These claims have never been confirmed by either nation state. According to anonymous
US officials speaking to the Washington Post, the worm was developed during the
administration of George W. Bush to sabotage Iranâ€™s nuclear program with what would
seem like a long series of unfortunate accidents.
Stuxnet has three modules: a worm that executes all routines related to the main payload of
the attack; a link file that automatically executes the propagated copies of the worm; and
a rootkit component responsible for hiding all malicious files and processes, preventing
detection of the presence of Stuxnet.
Stuxnet is typically introduced to the target environment via an infected USB flash drive.
The worm then propagates across the network, scanning for Siemens Step7 software on
computers controlling a PLC. In the absence of either criterion, Stuxnet becomes dormant
inside the computer. If both the conditions are fulfilled, Stuxnet introduces the infected
rootkit onto the PLC and Step7 software, modifying the codes and giving unexpected
commands to the PLC while returning a loop of normal operations system values feedback
to the users.
