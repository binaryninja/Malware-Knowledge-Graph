Scan for HAFNIUM Exploitation Evidence with THOR Lite

March 6, 2021

Since we’ve heard from partners and friends about many non-profit organisations affected by
the Exchange server vulnerability, we’ve decided to transfer many detection rules from our
commercial scanner into the free community version.
If you haven’t heard of THOR or THOR Lite before, I’d recommend reading the product page
of at least THOR Lite.
TLDR: It’s a forensic scanner with the focus on traces of hacking activity, configuration
backdoors, file anomalies and other things that an Antivirus often misses like web shells or
the output of hack tools that has been left over by the attackers. It is portable and doesn’t
require an installation.

What we did to improve THOR Lite
We’ve added many of the signature that we also sell with THOR and the VALHALLA rule
feed to the Open Source repository. Fellow researchers provided additional YARA signatures
for some webshell types and traces in log files.
Only a few rules haven’t been published with THOR Lite in order to keep some detection
logic secret. (creative ways to detect the compiled ASP.NET DLLs)
YARA rules, filename IOCs and hash IOCs provided by Microsoft and Volexity are also
already included.
We estimate the coverage provided by the open source rules and IOCs to be around 95%.

We even have translated the Sigma rules used in THOR into YARA rules in order to enable
the detection of these patterns in THOR Lite (as THOR Lite doesn’t allow Sigma scanning
but can apply these rules in the available ‘Logscan’ module).

Included IOCs and YARA Rules
YARA – Hafnium samples and forensic evidence – apt_hafnium.yar
YARA – Exploitation in log files – apt_hafnium_log_sigs.yar
Hash IOCs – hash-iocs.txt
Filename IOCs – filename-iocs.txt

Getting Started

3/6

We offer THOR Lite for free. All we require is a newsletter subscription. (side note: we’ve
never sent a newsletter to that list so far. This will be the first blog post that will be sent to all
subscribers)
Just visit the download page, subscribe, receive a license file and download links to
download the scanner package.
After the download you place the license file sent to you in a separate email into the
extracted program folder and should immediately update the signatures with the following
command:
thor-lite-util.exe update
If you want to use a web proxy to connect to the Internet, use the following command to get a
help for the “update” command.
thor-lite-util.exe update --help
If you are already a user of THOR Lite, make sure to use at least signature set version
“21.3.6-090007”.

Specific Recommendations
Exclude Mailbox Folders
We recommend excluding the mailboxes from the scan by adding the following lines to the
file ./config/directory-excludes.cfg
\\(MDBDATA|Mailbox|Mailbox Database)\\
Scanning this directory would just slow down the scan and – according to all available
reports – wouldn’t be necessary to produce relevant findings.

Exchange on Drives Other than C:
If your Exchange server isn’t installed on drive C:, use the “–allhds” flag.
thor64-lite.exe --allhds
Otherwise just run a standard scan without flags.

Antivirus Exclusion
Since THOR Lite doesn’t provide modules for “Rootkit” detection or problematic modules like
“Mutex” or “NamedPipes”, you shouldn’t have problems scanning systems without an
Antivirus exclusion filter.

4/6

All YARA rules are included in a compressed and encrypted form so that an Antivirus
shouldn’t trigger on clear text signatures as it is the case for most of the other YARA
scanners including LOKI.
However, since some realtime engines check every file that THOR Lite has “touched” during
its scan, an Antivirus exclusion can increase the scan speed by ~30% and avoid any
interference (blocked access to some files etc.).

Scanning a Subset Only
You could run a scan on a subset only and skip other system folders. If you have a good
picture of the location of the Exchange folder and all relevant sub directories (log files, owa
web service folders), you could run a selective scan using the following command.
thor64-lite.exe -a Filescan -p "C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server"
However, we do not know if all relevant forensic evidence can be found in that folder.

Intense Mode
Don’t use the “–intense” flag or use it only in cases in which it is okay for the scan to take
12+ hours to complete and system stability isn’t a concern – which is almost never the case.
The “–intense” flag is meant for lab scenarios or use cases in which a maximum detection
rate is very important. Warning: That flag disables all system resource monitoring safe
guards that we’ve integrated into THOR.

Lab Scans
Test the scan on samples that you’ve collected using the following commands:
thor64-lite.exe -a Filescan -p D:\collected-samples
thor64-lite.exe --fsonly -p D:\collected-samples
The first command reflects the scan mode that is used during a default scan with all
modules. The second command starts THOR in “lab scanning” mode, which scans samples
regardless of their extension and magic header. If you discover samples that get detected
only in lab scanning mode, please let us know. (see “How Can I Help” below)

How Can I Help
Please provide feedback on false positives. Include all information that you’re allowed
to share, e.g. file name, file hash, rule name or the full log line with all confidential
information removed. Use the issues section on Github or send an email to
rules@nextron-systems.com.

5/6

Please help us cover false negatives. If you’ve found a webshell or forensic evidence
that THOR Lite wasn’t able to detect, please provide that evidence and we add
coverage for everyone in the community to use. (open source YARA rule usable in any
scanner including LOKI and THOR Lite)

FAQs
Where can I find help?
Please first check the documentation, which is provided as PDF in the ./docs sub folder. It’s
written for THOR, but many chapters also apply to THOR Lite.
You can report THOR Lite issues on Github.

How can I scan unsupported Windows version?
We provide a legacy version of THOR to scan outdated Windows version (2003, 2008) for
our customers only. Sorry. You can find information on pricing in the license packs section.

How can I provide samples that haven’t been detected?
Please add information about them to a new issue on Github or send them to rules@nextronsystems.com.

I’ve subscribed to the Newsletter but didn’t get an email with a license file or
the download links. What can I do?
The response emails sometimes get classified as SPAM. Please check your junk mail folder.
In 100% of the cases in which subscribers didn’t get a corresponding email, this was the
reason.
