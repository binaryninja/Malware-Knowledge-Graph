The BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team

AvosLocker and the affiliate group behind it appear to be ramping up their operations
targeting critical infrastructure in the U.S., sparking a recent advisory from the FBI and
FinCEN. The bulletin includes the malware’s Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and a
warning that the criminal group seems to be focusing on financial services, critical
manufacturing, government facilities and other critical industries.
First seen late 2021, this aggressive ransomware is designed to quickly encrypt valuable
data on compromised machines. Like most modern ransomware families such as
LokiLocker, AvosLocker is sold and distributed as Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS), which
means that the attack vectors and targets of the malware are open to the needs of the
malware operator. This threat is not just Windows® -based. In early 2022, a Linux® -based
variant of the malware was found that targets VMware ESXi Virtual Machine (VM)
environments.

AvosLocker has adopted a common feature of modern ransomware in its choice of double
extortion. This ploy involves attackers compromising the victim’s environment prior to the
execution of the ransom attack and exfiltrating valuable data. Like the previously discussed
malware family Karma, data pilfered by AvosLocker is often hosted on an Onion page found
via the Tor browser. This tactic is meant to put additional pressure on affected organizations
to pay the ransom demand, as attackers will publish sensitive data online if victims don’t
pay in time.

Operating System

Risk & Impact

Technical Analysis
Infection Vector
Since AvosLocker ransomware is sold as RaaS, attackers can use different mechanisms,
artifacts, and tooling on victims’ machines. Based on our initial findings, attacks appear to
be premeditated, and threat groups perform reconnaissance prior to the deployment of the
ransomware. According to the FBI Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) report, tools like Cobalt
Strike, Advanced IP Scanner, and AnyDesk are common in AvosLocker attacks.
It is likely that the threat actor maintains a foothold and has already achieved persistence
on a victim organization’s network to exfiltrate data. The malware operators will execute the
ransomware once initial steps of their attacks are conducted, then clear their tracks after
their objective is achieved.
File Analysis
AvosLocker ransomware can affect systems based on Windows (written in C++) and Linux
(compiled in GCC 4.4.7), with specific versions of the malware developed to target each
operating system, as seen in Figure 1.

2/13

Figure 1 – Side-by-side comparison of Linux (left) and Windows (right) versions of
AvosLocker

Neither the Windows nor the Linux version of the malware attempts to hide the fact that it is
malicious. They are not signed with falsified or stolen digital certificate data, and they do not
try to fool a victim into thinking the file is safe, to get them to inadvertently execute the
malware.
This lack of deception is likely because the malware is being executed by attackers that are
already on the compromised victim’s network, or through remote code-execution via
persistence mechanisms already deployed on the compromised network.
The malware has various flags that will determine its execution flow, including enabling
further features of the malware that can be customized by the malware operator. Depending
on the aim of the threat actor executing the ransomware, various flags can be set, enabling
further features of the malware. These can be seen in the table and Figure 2 below.

Windows-Based Parameters

3/13

Figure 2 – AvosLocker (Windows) parameters

When the Windows version of the malware is executed using its default settings, a dialog
box will be generated that indicates this build of the malware (as of early 2022) is called
“Sonic,” as shown in Figure 3.
By default, the malware will execute using 200 threads concurrently to achieve its
encryption, which makes it faster than other ransomware families we have analyzed.

Preventing Unintentional Corruption
This malware has a variety of methods in place to prevent itself from damaging a victim’s
files or machine beyond repair. Some of these behaviors are quite common, though one in
particular is unexpected.
Ransomware commonly avoids encrypting certain directories and files to prevent the entire
system from becoming unrecoverable. Causing this kind of damage would defeat the
incentive for victims to pay the ransom, so the ransomware will only be destructive to
specific file-extensions, omitting key files and directories.

4/13

The unique twist in this tactic is that there is a console dialog box created by the running
instance of AvosLocker that notifies which files it will skip or avoid encrypting, as shown in
Figure 4. This only appears to be enabled or disabled by using the flag/variable “-s” or “-unsafe.”

Figure 4 – Console dialog box of AvosLocker

The malware will also create a mutex named “Cheic0WaZie6zeiy.” It uses this marker to
check if it’s already running, to prevent the malware from reinfecting a machine.

Encryption and Ransom
The malware will quickly scan for attached drives, looking for files to encrypt. Once
scanning is complete, the threat will rapidly iterate through the device, appending filenames
on Windows machines with either “.avos” or “.avos2” (for the 2022 version), and
“AvosLinux” on Linux machines.
On Windows, the ransom note: “GET_YOUR_FILES_BACK.txt,” shown in Figure 5, is
added to all directories that have been affected by the ransomware.

5/13

Figure 5 – AvosLocker (Windows) ransom note

The malware uses RSA encryption, with a hardcoded RSA public key that is stored within
the malware itself. Once a file is encrypted, AvosLocker appends a snippet of Base64 data
to each file it has encoded, as shown in Figure 6. This is likely done to prevent doubleencryption or re-infection, and to identify files by the decryption methodology the threat
group deploys, so that it can properly decrypt files if a ransom is successfully paid.
If the ransomware was executed twice on a comprised system, the twice-encrypted data is
likely to become un-recoverable and/or corrupt. As with omitting critical files from
encryption, preventing files from being corrupted is done to avoid defeating the purpose of
demanding payment for recovering a victim’s data.

Linux AvosLocker
To maximize the malware’s damage potential, in early 2022, the threat actors behind
AvosLocker developed a Linux edition of the ransomware aimed at targeting and encrypting
VMware ESXi. The file details of the Linux version are shown in Figure 7.

6/13

Figure 7 – AvosLocker (Linux) file details

Compiled in GCC 4.4.7 like its Windows-based counterpart, the malware does little to hide
itself. It’s also likely to be deployed only after the initial goals of the threat group have been
achieved.
Also like the Windows version, the Linux version of the malware has various flags that it can
accept on execution to carry out specific tasks. This is shown in the table and Figure 8
below.

Linux-Based Parameters

Figure 8 – AvosLocker (Linux parameters)

After execution in a Linux environment, the malware will append the file extension
“AvosLinux” to signify successful encryption. The malware will drop the text document
“README_FOR_RESTORE,” shown in Figure 9, which has similar content to its Windowsbased counterpart.

Omitted Files
The malware will target all files in a Linux environment except for files with the “.avoslinux”
or “.avos2” file-extension (which are encrypted by the malware), or the
“README_FOR_RESTORE” ransom note files.
AvosLocker has a variable called “esxi,” which can be used to further limit the file types that
are encrypted, to only target VMware-related files.

.vmem
.vsmp
.vswp
.vmsm
.log

Leak Site
AvosLocker’s Tor Onion website allows malware operators to open a dialogue with affected
organizations, and is used to host its “leak site,” which is shown in Figure 10. Upon
encryption, an ID is generated in the ransom note that instructs the victim to download the
Tor Browser and contact the threat actors directly to organize ransom payment.

8/13

To add additional pressure to the victim organization, threat actors will post a series of
documents they have successfully exfiltrated. As of the time of writing, there are multiple
victims listed. The latest mentioned on its leak site was affected by the ransomware on
March 22, as seen in Figure 11.

Conclusion
AvosLocker ransomware is extremely fast and impactful, designed to encrypt a system in a
matter of moments. Though AvosLocker shares a lot in common with most advanced
ransomware families currently in the wild, its focus on large-scale targets and varying
deployment tactics makes this threat extremely dangerous.
Stopping “just” ransomware is difficult enough. But because of the way this threat spreads,
even if the attempt fails, it’s likely that a breach in the organization’s network has already
occurred. Documents and valuable data have probably already been stolen before the
ransomware stage of the attack even begins.
Constant activity on the ransomware’s leak site acts as a warning to other companies, and
a direct threat to those who fall victim to the malware. While this double-extortion ploy is
potentially more lucrative for threat actors, it is also far riskier, as there are several steps
that must be accomplished without being detected for them to achieve their nefarious goals.
AvosLocker is constantly evolving, with new updates being periodically released. We will
update this post with new information as it becomes available.
