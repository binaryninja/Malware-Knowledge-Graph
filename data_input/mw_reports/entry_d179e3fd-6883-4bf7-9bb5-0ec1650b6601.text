Our full Report

Introduction
The geopolitical conflicts in the Middle East have
deepened in the last few years. Syria is no exception, with
the crisis there taking many forms, and the cyberspace
conflict is intensifying as sides try to tilt the struggle in their
favor by exploiting cyber intelligence and using distortion.

The Global Research & Analysis Team (GReAT) at
Kaspersky Lab has discovered new malware attacks in
Syria, using some techniques to hide and operate
malware, in addition to proficient social engineering tricks
to deliver malware by tricking and tempting victims to open
and launch malicious files. The malware files were found
on activist sites and social networking forums, some other
files were also reported by local organizations like
CyberArabs and Technicians for Freedom.

can be found here.

A glance at what was discovered
The number of attacks and malicious files being
distributed is constantly increasing as the attackers
become more organized and proficient. The samples are
all based on Remote Administration Trojan Tools (RATs)
The number of malicious files found: 110
The number of domains linked to the attacks: 20
The number of IP addresses linked to the attacks: 47

The National Security Program – what the
malware attacks look like
Masquerading as a reportedly “Government leaked
program” that has the names of all wanted people in Syria,
the National Security Program conceals a full featured
RAT client to steal all sorts of information under one of its
buttons.

‫ﺑﺭﻧﺎﻣﺞ ﺍﻷﻣﻥ ﺍﻟﻭﻁﻧﻲ‬.exe (The national security program)

Using shockingly disturbing videos to distribute
malware
A disturbing video showing injured victims of recent
bombings was used on YouTube to appeal to people’s fear
and prompt them to download a malicious application
available on a public file sharing website. After initial

analysis, the file named “‫ﻓﺿﺎﺋﺢ‬.exe” (Scandals.exe) proved
to be heavily obfuscated with the commercial utility
“MaxToCode” for .NET in order to avoid early detection by
antivirus solutions.

Did you install your “Ammazon” Security Suite?
If you thought the era of fake antiviruses was over, here
comes this newly developed Syrian sample to challenge
your beliefs. With the innocent title of “Ammazon Internet
Security”, this malicious application tries to mimic a
security scanner, even including a quite thorough
graphical user interface and some interactive functionality.

Your “Ammazon” is now secure, what about the
rest of your network?
Total Network Monitor (which is a legitimate application) is
inside another sample found, being used with embedded
malware for spying purposes. Offering security
applications to protect against surveillance is one of the
many techniques used by malware writing groups to get
users desperate for privacy to execute these dubious

programs.

Instant messaging, instant infection
It’s also the case with other samples, where social
engineering does all the heavy work. Instant messaging
applications for desktop operating systems have been
used in the past to spread malware and it seems Syrian
malware authors have jumped on the bandwagon.

Beware of Chemical Attacks
Another of the attacks using social engineering tricks, the
sample named Kimawi.exe (Arabic for Chemicals) with a
JPG icon, is a RAT file bound to the image Kimawi.jpg.
The picture is a previously leaked paper supposedly from
the regime in Syria warning military units to prepare for
Chemical Attacks. The file is being sent by email to
selected victims.

FAQ
What is new?
The threat actors are becoming more organized, the
number of attacks is increasing and the samples being
used are becoming more sophisticated, while also relying
extensively on powerful social engineering tricks that
many people fall for.

Where are the victims and the attackers?
The victims infected when accessing the hacked forums
and social networking sites tend to be ordinary users or
activistshey were, or specific targets if they receive the
malware via email, Skype, or messages on social
networking sites.

The victims are also located outside Syria. We have seen
victims of Syrian­based malware in:

1. Turkey
2. Saudi Arabia
3. Lebanon
4. Palestine
5. United Arab Emirates
6. Israel
7. Morocco

8. France
9. United States
The attackers’ command and control centers were tracked
to IP addresses in Syria, Russia, Lebanon, the US and
Brazil.

How many have fallen victim?
We believe the number of victims exceeds 10,000, with
some of the files being downloaded more than 2000 times.

The attackers’ malware samples and variations have
increased dramatically from only a few in Q1 2013 to
around 40 in Q2 2014.

What is the impact on victims?
Remote Administration Trojans tools are used to fully
compromise the system on victim devices. RATs are
capable of stealing user credentials in addition to
activating camera and microphone functionalities…

Are users protected?
Kaspersky detects and blocks all the samples that have
been found. They are detected as follows:

Trojan.MSIL.Zapchast
Backdoor.Win32.Bifrose
Backdoor.Win32.Fynloski
Backdoor.Win32.Xtreme

samples can be found in the full report here.
