Note: This blog is part of a three-blog series on Vulnerability Intelligence that accompanies
the release of Digital Shadows’ latest whitepaper titled Vulnerability Intelligence: Do You
Know Where Your Flaws Are?
Managing vulnerabilities is a daunting task for security teams that are constantly busy with
keeping up with the vulnerability threat landscape. New security flaws are discovered every
day; consequently, security teams are often pushed into patching without adequate planning
and missing bugs that continue to represent a significant risk. The result? Cybercriminals
and state-sponsored threat actors can often leverage unpatched vulnerabilities to get access
to a target’s environment and conduct further malicious activity.
In an ideal world, these vulnerabilities are responsibly disclosed, giving vendors time to
respond publicly and roll out timely patches. Even better, critical software vulnerabilities
would get patched automatically! In this utopian environment, patches wouldn’t cause
everything to break in production and conflicting interdependencies could be easily fixed.
Doesn’t this sound dreamy? Sadly, this is not a very plausible scenario for most security
teams out there.

We won’t judge you if you plan on turning into a Metapod when faced with patching
dilemmas
The current information technology (IT) landscape is a highly complex environment of old
and new technologies that have significantly expanded the attack surface. When new
vulnerabilities are disclosed, security teams often need to scramble to figure out how these
would impact their systems and what to patch first. Adopting an efficient vulnerability
management program can offset some of the traditional challenges associated with triaging
threats and asset management, and significantly improve your organization’s security
posture.
For this reason, Digital Shadows has just published its latest research piece titled
Vulnerability Intelligence: Do you know where your flaws are?, where we have explored the
cybercriminal forums rabbit hole to understand how threat actors are continually exploiting

security teams’ weaknesses. The picture we obtained has convinced us that the traditional –
and sometimes chaotic – approach to vulnerability patching is not sustainable anymore and
that we need a new paradigm to stay one step ahead of malicious actors.

What Does the Illegal Zero-Day Market Look Like?
As part of our investigation, we gathered extensive primary source evidence from
cybercriminal markets and forums to better comprehend how the vulnerability criminal
industry looks. This environment is bursting with a variety of widespread actors who boast a
whole range of technical expertise and motives. The technical discussions of this eclectic
underground cohort have actually contributed to a pretty cohesive, crowd-sourced body of
knowledge about vulnerabilities and exploits.
The top of the cybercriminal pyramid is represented by the market for zero-days. This market
is an extremely expensive and competitive one, and it’s usually been a prerogative of statesponsored threat groups. However, certain high-profile cybercriminal groups (read:
ransomware gangs) have amassed incredible fortunes in the past years and can now
compete with the traditional buyers of zero-day exploits.

Threat actor offering 3,000,000 USD for a 0-click RCE zero-day
This is probably why zero-day sellers have moved their auctions to cybercriminal forums: to
fish in this large and wealthy pool. Zero-day exploits are incredibly pricey and we’ve
observed threat actors claiming that they could go away for up to $10,000,000. These prices
may look jaw-dropping but there’s a key aspect to keep in mind. Whatever legitimate bug
bounty programs offer, cybercriminals must offer more in order to compete with them, given
the risks (jail time) and additional requirements needed during illicit activity (i.e. money
laundering).
Is it clear now why this has traditionally been a state-sponsor-exclusive club? Very few
cybercriminals have that kind of money to splash on a vulnerability. And even fewer of them
will be actually motivated to invest that sum when organizations still have public-facing
remote desktop protocol (RDP) appliances in their networks (and yes, there are a lot of
them). But an espionage campaign of a state-sponsored APT group can easily justify sinking
funds into an exclusive zero-day, if it reels in invaluable information.

The Rise of the Exploit-as-a-Service Model?
Feel like a multi-million dollar price tag may be a bit too much for your pockets? No worries,
the cybercriminal community doesn’t leave anyone behind to miss out on all the zero-day
fun! During our investigation for this research piece we’ve noticed cybercriminals discussing
ideas for an Exploit-as-a-Service business model that would inevitably lower the barrier for
accessing sophisticated exploits.

This model would allow capable threat actors to “lease” zero-day exploits to other
cybercriminals to conduct their attacks. In fact, while a developer can generate large profits
when selling a zero-day exploit, it often takes them a significant amount of time to complete
such a sale. However, this model would enable zero-day developers to generate substantial
earnings by renting the zero-day out while waiting for a definitive buyer. Additionally, renting
parties could test the proposed zero-day and later decide whether to purchase the exploit on
an exclusive or non-exclusive basis.

Zero-day exploit developers can certainly generate large profits by selling to governmentbacked threat actors, but this process can eat up time and drive the developers to seek
alternative revenue sources. And that’s when exploit-as-a-service becomes
viable―generating their desired income from various interested parties. The result? More
and more financially motivated threat actors with their hands on dangerous tools.

Old Vulnerabilities Are Still a Serious Problem
Zero-days and high-profile threat actors can certainly make up for great insights into the
cybercriminal world but they do only represent a tiny fraction of this complex ecosystem. The
wide majority of the cybercriminal community is in fact busy discussing and sharing
knowledge on older vulnerabilities that security teams haven’t properly patched yet.
Apart from a few exceptions, the cybercriminal community is known for being opportunistic
and targeting the low-hanging fruit rather than mounting highly-sophisticated offensive
campaigns. Overlooked security flaws in software and hardware may well provide
cybercriminals with valuable initial access to a victim’s environment and cause some serious
harm from there.

Nothing will ever hurt more
The user base for older vulnerabilities is broad. For starters, many low-skilled cybercriminals
need some time before they can exploit a new vulnerability, and maybe even need support
from the cybercriminal community, like tutorials or guides on how to use the latest exploit.
Then there are the penny-pinchers. Despite the high payouts associated with cybercrime,
we’re all now aware that the best (zero-day) exploits don’t come cheap. It can be worthwhile
to wait for a vulnerability to become more mainstream, with corresponding PoCs or exploits
released for free or at a lower price.

Strengthen your Fortress with Vulnerability Intelligence
Ok, maybe the ideal world described at the beginning of this blog is still far away from our
radar. However, security teams can still significantly improve their security posture with a few
changes to their habits. For example, incorporating a risk-based approach to vulnerability
management can go a long way in helping security teams navigate this sea of vulnerabilities.
A framework based on the impact and likelihood of vulnerability exploitation can certainly
help mitigate some of the triaging and asset management challenges mentioned above.
However, making informed decisions requires a good dose of contextual knowledge around
the latest vulnerabilities disclosed. Identifying intelligence needs based on your threat model
is therefore crucial to improve triaging and patching processes. Incorporating vulnerability
intelligence will help you prevent and quickly mitigate the most relevant threats for your
specific organization. And once fused into your organization’s threat model, vulnerability

5/6

intelligence can be used across a variety of internal functions to improve security planning,
such as triaging threats, communicating them across the board, and mitigating them in a
timely and accurate manner.
