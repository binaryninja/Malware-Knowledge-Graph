The operators of the Darkside ransomware are believed to have made at least $90 million
from ransom payments over the past nine months, since October 2020.
“In total, just over $90 million in Bitcoin ransom payments were made to DarkSide,
originating from 47 distinct wallets,” blockchain analysis firm Elliptic said in a report published
earlier today.
Citing data shared by dark web intelligence platform DarkTrace, Elliptic said the Darkside
group appears to have made at least 99 victims, of which approximately 47% paid their
ransom demands.
“The average payment was $1.9 million,” said Elliptic co-founder and chief scientist Dr.
Tom Robinson.
“May was set to be a record month, until DarkSide reportedly shut down its operations on
May 13, and its Bitcoin wallet was emptied.”

Elliptic’s report comes after previous studies have put the estimated earnings of gangs
like Maze/Egregor at $75 million, Ryuk at $150 million, REvil at $100 million (threat actor’s
own claims), and Netwalker at $25 million (for a period of 3 months only).
While estimating a ransomware gang’s earnings is not an exact science, as investigators
never have a full picture of a gang’s operations, Elliptic’s findings firmly put the Darkside
group in the upper echelon of ransomware operations.
Since Darkside is provided through a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model, which allows
the Darkside coders to keep 25% of the paid ransoms, or 10% if the ransom is larger than $5
million, Elliptic believes that the actual Darkside group made roughly $15.5 million, while
the rest of the funds were transferred to Darkside’s affiliates—the group who rented the
ransomware and then deployed it inside the hacked companies.
Bot knowing how much money a ransomware gang made is a rather useless stat that does
nothing but promotes the profitability of the ransomware criminal ecosystem.
In an email today, Dr. Robinson told The Record that they weren’t only able to estimate the
group’s earnings, but they were also able to track down how the Darkside payments moved
across the blockchain to cash-out points, information which the Elliptic exec said is available
to the law enforcement agencies that use its platform and “which provides investigators with
important leads.”
