gov/ncsd-feedback/

Is your control system accessible directly from the Internet? Do you use remote access
features to log into your control system network? Are you unsure of the security measures
that protect your remote access services? If your answer was yes to any or all these
questions, you are at increased risk of cyber attacks including scanning, probes, brute
force attempts and unauthorized access to your control environment.
Internet facing devices have become a serious concern over the past few years with
remote access demands giving way to insecure or vulnerable configurations. Tools,
such as SHODAN, Google and other search engines, enable researchers and adversaries
to easily discover and identify a variety of ICS devices that were not intended to be
Internet facing. Adding to the threat landscape is the continued scanning and cataloguing
of devices known to be susceptible to emerging vulnerabilities such as the OpenSSL
“Heartbleed.” In addition, the search terms needed to identify ICS devices are widely
available because of an increasing public body of knowledge with detailed ICS-specific
terminology. The availability of this information, coupled with the aforementioned
tools, lowers the level of knowledge required to successfully locate Internet facing
control systems.
In many cases, these devices have not been configured with adequate authentication
mechanisms, thereby further increasing the chances of both opportunistic and targeted
attempts to directly access these components. As tools and adversary capabilities
advance, we expect that exposed systems will be more effectively discovered, and
targeted by adversaries. Clearly, it has become more important for asset owners and
operators to audit their network configurations and properly install their ICS devices
behind patched VPNs or firewalls.
Most recently, ICS-CERT received reports of three new cyber incidents that resulted from
weak network configuration and/or lack of perimeter security. Two of those incidents
involved intrusions by unauthorized parties, and the other was identified as vulnerable
by a researcher. In the majority of these cases, the system owners are unaware of the
nonsecure configurations or the associated risk.
Public Utility Compromised
A public utility was recently compromised when a sophisticated threat actor gained
unauthorized access to its control system network. After notification of the incident,
ICS-CERT validated that the software used to administer the control system assets was
accessible via Internet facing hosts. The systems were configured with a remote access
capability, utilizing a simple password mechanism; however, the authentication method
was susceptible to compromise via standard brute forcing techniques.
ICS-CERT provided analytical assistance, including host-based forensic analysis and
a comprehensive review of available network logs. It was determined that the systems
were likely exposed to numerous security threats and previous intrusion activity was
also identified. ICS-CERT conducted an onsite cybersecurity assessment in response to

1

INCIDENT RESPONSE ACTIVITY - Continued
this incident to assist the asset owners with evaluating the overall
security posture of their infrastructure. In addition, ICS-CERT
made practical recommendations for re-architecting and securing
the control network. This incident highlights the need to evaluate
security controls employed at the perimeter and ensure that
potential intrusion vectors (ex: remote access) are configured
with appropriate security controls, monitoring, and
detection capabilities.
Control Systems Device Remotely Accessed by Threat Actor
The second example involved an unprotected, Internet-connected,
control system operating a mechanical device. Upon investigation,
ICS-CERT determined that a sophisticated threat actor had
accessed the control system server (connected via a cellular
modem) through a supervisory control and data acquisition
(SCADA) protocol. The device was directly Internet accessible and
was not protected by a firewall or authentication access controls.
At the time of compromise, the control system was mechanically
disconnected from the device for scheduled maintenance.
ICS-CERT provided analytic assistance and determined that the
actor had access to the system over an extended period of time and
had connected via both HTTP and the SCADA protocol. However,
further analysis determined that no attempts were made by the
threat actor to manipulate the system or inject unauthorized control
actions. After the incident was resolved, ICS-CERT conducted an
onsite cybersecurity assessment of its larger control environment
to evaluate its security posture and make recommendations for
further securing its remote access to its control network. This
incident highlights the need for perimeter security and monitoring
capabilities to prevent adversaries from discovering vulnerable
ICSs and using them as targets of opportunity.
Sochi Arena HVAC System Exposed to the Internet
Billy Rios, a researcher at Qualys, provided information to
ICS-CERT and various media outlets concerning an Internet facing
HVAC and Energy Management System (EMS) associated with an
arena at the Sochi Olympics in Russia. This system was reported to
lack authentication requirements to access the control system. The
researcher worked with the system integrator to reconfigure the
system prior to the Olympics and opening ceremonies.
What Should You Do?
ICS-CERT strongly encourages taking immediate defensive action
to secure ICSs by using defense-in-depth principles. Audit your
networks for Internet facing devices, weak authentication methods,
and component vulnerabilities. Understand the usage of tools, such
as SHODAN and Google, and leverage those platforms to enhance
awareness of the Internet accessible devices that might exist within
your infrastructure.

ICS-CERT also recommends that users take defensive measures to
minimize the risk of exploitation as follows:
• Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. In
general, locate control system networks and devices behind
firewalls and isolate them from the business network.
• When remote access is required, employ secure methods, such
as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs
may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most
current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as
secure as the connected devices.
• Remove, disable or rename any default system accounts
wherever possible.
• Implement account lockout policies to reduce the risk from
brute forcing attempts.
• Establish and implement policies requiring the use of
strong passwords.
• Monitor the creation of administrator level accounts by
third-party vendors.
• Apply patches in the ICS environment, when possible, to
mitigate known vulnerabilities.
Organizations that observe any suspected malicious activity
should follow their established internal procedures and report their
findings to ICS-CERT for incident response support and correlation
with other similar incidents. We urge critical infrastructure owners
and operators to evaluate their systems and ensure that they are not
directly accessible from the Internet.
ICS-CERT encourages organizations to reference the previously
released alerts, which detail the risks associated with Internetaccessible ICS devices. ICS-CERT reminds organizations to
perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking
defensive measures.

RECAP OF VUNERABILITIES IN 2013
As previously reported in the 2013 Year in Review, ICS-CERT received 181 vulnerability reports from researchers and ICS vendors
throughout the year. Of those, 177 were determined to be true vulnerabilities that involved coordination, testing, and analysis across
52 vendors. The majority of these or 87 percent were exploitable remotely while the other 13 percent required local access to exploit
the vulnerabilities. A fundamental recommendation for mitigating remotely exploitable vulnerabilities is to minimize network exposure
and configure ICSs behind firewalls so they aren’t directly accessible and exploitable from the Internet. Equally important is patching
and updating ICS devices as soon as practically possible, understanding that patches and upgrades must be properly tested by each asset
owner/operator before being implemented in operational environments. The following chart depicts the different types of vulnerabilities
reported and coordinated in 2013.

Authentication flaws were the most abundant vulnerability type
coordinated in 2013, which includes vulnerabilities like factory
hard-coded credentials, weak authentication keys, etc. These tend
to be of highest concern because an attacker with minimal skill
level could potentially gain administrator level access to devices
that are accessible remotely over the Internet.
New for 2013 was the inclusion of medical device vulnerabilities
as some researchers began to shift their efforts toward these
devices. Instrumental in this shift was the relationship that
ICS-CERT formed with the US Department of Health and Human
Services, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and
multiple medical device manufacturers. One noteworthy example
of these efforts was a report from researchers Billy Rios and Terry
McCorkle who discovered a hard-coded password vulnerability

affecting roughly 300 medical devices across approximately 40
vendors. The affected devices are manufactured by a broad range
of vendors and fall into a broad range of categories, including but
not limited to:
• Surgical and anesthesia devices,
• Ventilators,
• Drug infusion pumps,
• External defibrillators,
• Patient monitors and
• Laboratory and analysis equipment.

ICS-CERT continues to coordinate with multiple vendors, the FDA
and the security researchers to identify specific mitigations across
all devices. The FDA has published recommendations and best
practices to help prevent unauthorized access or modification to
medical devices.

of the 177 vulnerabilities, 93 have been documented and released
in advisories and those 93 are represented below. The remaining
84 vulnerabilities are currently in open tickets that ICS-CERT is
coordinating between researchers and vendors, and CVSS scores
have not been determined for each of them yet.

Notable among many of the higher ranking vulnerabilities were
the DNP3 vulnerabilities discovered by Adam Crain and Chris
Sistrunk. These serious flaws affect certain implementations
of the DNP3 protocol in various master-slave station products.
These vulnerabilities, if exploited, could cause a denial-of-service
(DoS) condition against the DNP3 master over either TCP/IP or
serial communication paths, impeding the DNP3 master from
communicating to field devices until remediated.

CVSS Severity Ranges

In response, ICS-CERT has been working with the affected vendors
to create patches or updates to mitigate risk to attacks leveraging
these vulnerabilities. To date, ICS-CERT has produced 18
advisories for various ICS devices. A comprehensive list of public
DNP3 implementation vulnerabilities can be found in ICS-CERT
Advisory ICSA-13-291-01B - DNP3 Implementation Vulnerability
(Update B) (http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-13-29101B) and in subsequent updates that will be released in the future.

Nearly 65 percent of the vulnerabilities that ICS-CERT coordinated
in 2013 were scored and ranked as high priority vulnerabilities
for asset owners and operators to mitigate in their systems.
These vulnerabilities scored 7.0 or higher using the Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).

When calculating CVSS scores, ICS-CERT uses the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) NVD CVSS Version
2 concise score calculator found at: http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.
cfm?calculator&adv&version=2. The base score is provided in
the form of a CVSS vector string, which tells readers the variables
that went into computing the score. An example of a vector string
that equates to a base score of 10.0 is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/
I:C/A:C). All advisories provide a link back to the NIST CVSS
calculator that displays the base metrics (see Figure 2). Readers
can combine information from the CVSS score, description of the
vulnerability and exploit availability and apply this information to
the best of their ability to their individual operating environment.
ICS-CERT provides CVSS base scores as a tool for affected asset
owners to aid them in prioritizing their mitigation strategies.
Control system owners/operators are encouraged to customize
the CVSS temporal and environmental metrics to calculate a total
score that applies to their individual deployment characteristics.
More information about CVSS scoring can be found at the FIRST
CVSS web site.

SITUATIONAL AWARENESS
ORK
Most of us lock our front doors when we leave the house. It is a simple way to increase the security of our home. In the same way, there
are basic steps that should be taken to secure control systems. As part of the strategy to assist industry with securing critical control
systems, ICS-CERT offers, and has conducted numerous onsite consultations, at no cost to asset owners. These engagements provide
an opportunity for security experts to examine an organization’s cybersecurity posture and report opportunities for the business to make
improvements.
The assessment approach helps asset owners and operators to select the level of ICS-CERT support needed to meet their operational
requirements. The assessment team has during the course of these assessments identified common vulnerabilities and weaknesses
(see Table 2), from access controls to networking design, that critical infrastructure owners and operators must consider when assessing
their infrastructure for potential threats and risks.

SITUATIONAL AWARENESS - Continued
A commonly observed challenge and one of the easiest to address is
a flat network topology. A risk associated with a flat network
is the absence of logical segmentation, which serves to restrict
communications originating from one portion of a network to
another portion of the same network, for example that of a standard
corporate/business network to the controls systems network. In
a flat or nonsegmented network topology, communications will
be uninhibited and able to traverse across all elements within the
network. Figure 3 illustrates how segmenting and implementing
a demilitarized zone (DMZ) adds security by limiting the
communication paths on the network.
A DMZ is a semi-trusted zone that acts as a buffer between
network segments. Business networks often place public facing
systems like web servers in a DMZ between their trusted business
network and the Internet. In control systems, a DMZ should exist
between the business network and the control systems network. In
addition, a DMZ should be established between the control system
network and any other network segments.

defense from potential compromise.
When configured correctly, networks segmented by DMZs are
much harder to compromise. An attacker with the aim of accessing
a control system must first gain access through a business
network’s perimeter firewall, then find a system that is authorized
to communicate with a host resident within the boundary
DMZ. Where the DMZ is configured with the most restrictive
communications paths, an attacker may be effectively thwarted at
this point as traffic rules enforced may not allow communication
from a host within the boundary DMZ to the business network.
Even if the business network becomes compromised, the DMZ
isolating the control systems will provide another layer of defense
in preventing access to your control system network.
ICS-CERT is continuously working closely with the control
systems community to increase awareness of defense-in-depth
strategies for cybersecurity. In the next Monitor, we will discuss
other common vulnerabilities and provide further information on
how to mitigate them and strengthen your overall security posture.

Figure 3

The critical aspect of a DMZ is to control the flow of
communications between each of the network segments for which
the DMZ provides segregation. This is typically done through
specially configured firewalls or routers, which enforce controlled
access to/from the DMZ, and can deny all other nonauthorized
traffic. The best rule set configurations do not allow the zones
to bypass the DMZ; instead they force traffic to use the systems
within the DMZ to push, pull or present data. The DMZ should
restrict communication flows to the most restrictive set of IPs, ports
and protocols, thereby providing an additional boundary or layer or

ENHANCED CYBERSECURITY
SERVICES (ECS) PROGRAM
In February 2014, a year after President Obama issued Executive
Order 13636 – Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity –
the White House released a new Cybersecurity Framework, a set
of guidelines to help the private sector enhance cybersecurity and
address cyber threats and vulnerabilities.
To help the private sector learn about and adopt the Framework, the
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) created and launched the
Critical Infrastructure Cyber Community (C3) Voluntary Program,
which gives critical infrastructure owners and operators access to
services and cybersecurity experts in the DHS. These experts have
knowledge about specific emerging cyber threats ways to counter
those threats, and guidance for mitigating cyber vulnerabilities
facing critical infrastructure.
One service DHS offers is the voluntary Enhanced Cybersecurity
Services (ECS) program. This program helps critical infrastructure
entities protect themselves against cyber threats to the systems
upon which so many Americans rely. This program is a good
example of information sharing with confidentiality, privacy and
civil liberties protections built into its structure.
Building on the Foundation
The Office of Cybersecurity & Communications (CS&C) has
established a community of trust between the public and private
sectors in order to improve the Nation’s overall computer network
defense posture. Through sharing cyber threat information with its
partners, DHS enables the detection, prevention and mitigation of
threats. This builds a holistic understanding of cyber threat activity

The ECS program is a significant component of CS&C’s
information sharing strategy. It builds on existing partnerships by
establishing a voluntary information-sharing program that helps
critical infrastructure owners and operators improve protection
of their systems from unauthorized access, exploitation, or data
exfiltration.

As with other DHS information-sharing programs, participation in
ECS is voluntary and designed to protect government intelligence,
corporate information security and the privacy of participants while
enhancing the security of critical infrastructure.
How does this work?
The ECS program works with cybersecurity organizations from
across the U.S. Government to access a broad range of cyber
threat information. DHS analyzes information that is specific
to identifying known or suspected cyber threats in the form of
“indicators,” which are human-readable cyber data used to identify
malicious cyber activity.
The indicators range in classification from unclassified to Top
Secret/SCI. Classification of identified indicators is dictated by its
source. CS&C identifies and validates the indicators that are critical
for protecting critical infrastructure and then shares the indicators
with participating Commercial Service Providers that will only
use them to provide approved ECS for their critical infrastructure
customers. These can be used to create “signatures” that are
machine readable and able to detect patterns of network traffic that
negatively affect critical infrastructure systems. ECS are intended
to augment, not replace, existing cybersecurity services operated by
or available to critical infrastructure entities.
Critical infrastructure customers do not receive threat information
directly from the government, but through their pre-approved CSP,
as shown in Figure 5.

Figure 4

What about Privacy?
Protecting our citizens’ privacy and civil liberties is a top priority
for the administration and the department. In fact, the ECS
program was built with these protections in mind.
ECS does not allow government monitoring of private
communications. CSPs may voluntarily share limited statistical
information, such as the timestamp of the cyber event,
indicator that was involved, and the identification of the critical
infrastructure sector of which the affected company is a member.
Under the ECS program, ECS-related information is not directly
shared between customers of the CSPs and the government.
Information, such as the company name or other identifiable
information, is not shared. CS&C will share the statistical
information it receives under ECS consistent with its existing
policies and procedures, including with other U.S. government
entities with cybersecurity responsibilities.

DHS-validated critical infrastructure entities. The CSPs may
also use the services to protect themselves.
To date, two participating CSPs are fully approved to provide ECS.

ACTIONABLE INFORMATION
THROUGH STIX
Providing actionable information that is quickly digestible and
useful to critical infrastructure owners, operators and vendors has
led to the adoption of the STIX (Structured Threat Information
eXpression) format. ICS-CERT has begun distributing alerts,
advisories and bulletins in a STIX-compliant format, which
includes both informational and actionable indicators. STIX is a
DHS-sponsored and community-driven effort to define and develop
a standardized language to represent cyber threat information. The
overall goal of STIX is to make intelligence, indicators and cyber
data machine-readable in a standard format.
At the core, STIX provides architecture for integrating a diverse set
of cyber threat information encompassing:
• Cyber observables (network or host-based indicators
and artifacts),
• Indicators (observables correlated with additional
contextual information),
• Incidents (instances of specific adversarial actions),
• TTPs (tactics, techniques and procedures – attack patterns,
malware, exploits, etc.),
• Exploit targets (vulnerabilities, weaknesses or configurations),
• Courses of action (best practices, defensive actions,
remediation),
• Cyberattack campaigns (collection of Incidents and/or TTPs
demonstrating a shared intent) and

priority of these indicators. Streamlining this process should reduce
the time from incident detection to containment with the ultimate
goal being detection and prevention. DHS has launched the initial
phase of TAXII (Trusted Automation eXchange of Indicator
Information) data delivery services to enable an automated
exchange of information represented using the STIX language.
For additional information pertaining to STIX and TAXII,
please contact ICS-CERT.

FIS Joins Forces with Microsoft to Advance Cybersecurity
2014-02-12

The Global Positioning System helps power everything from in-car
satnavs and smart bombs to bank security and flight control, but
its founder has warned that it is more vulnerable to sabotage or
disruption than ever before – and politicians and security chiefs are
ignoring the risk.

Underscoring its commitment to deliver information security
excellence, FIS(TM) (NYSE: FIS), the world’s largest provider
of banking and payments technology, announces its selection by
Microsoft as a partner in the fight against cybercrime.

Impairment of the system by hostile foreign governments, cyber
criminals – or even regular citizens – has become “a matter of
national security”, according to Colonel Bradford Parkinson, who
is hailed as the architect of modern navigation.

Abusing Cloud Services for Cybercrime
2014-02-14
Building a botnet typically involves infecting a PC. But at the
upcoming RSA Conference , two researchers plan to show how to
build one with free cloud services. Bishop Fox security researchers
Oscar Salazar and Rob Ragan were able to automate the process of
signing up for accounts on various cloud services, opening the door
for abuse of legitimate cloud infrastructure in the name of cybercrime. It is not the first time that researchers have discussed the use
of cloud platforms by attackers. Recent research from Solutionary
for example showed that cybercriminals are increasingly using
legitimate hosting providers like Amazon and GoDaddy to host
malicious domains.

White House Pushes Cybersecurity Framework for
Critical Infrastructure
2014-02-12
A new cybersecurity framework released Wednesday by U.S.
President Barack Obama’s administration aims to help operators
of critical infrastructure develop comprehensive
cybersecurity programs.
The voluntary framework creates a consensus on what a good
cybersecurity program looks like, senior administration officials
said. The 41-page framework takes a risk management approach
that allows organizations to adapt to “a changing cybersecurity
landscape and responds to evolving and sophisticated threats in a
timely manner,” according to the document.

Under the agreement, FIS representatives will work hand-in-hand
with forensic analysts, software developers and researchers at the
Microsoft Cybercrime Center, which opened in November 2013.
The partnership goal is to increase cooperative action between
international law enforcement and private industry in order to help
continuously improve the security of payments and financial
transactions worldwide and make the Internet a safer place to
do business.

One Agency Should Have Authority to Deal With Power Grid
Threats: FERC Chief
2014-02-12
Congress should consider passing legislation that would give one
agency “clear and direct authority” to respond to imminent threats
to the US power system, Cheryl LaFleur, acting chairman of the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has told lawmakers.
“This authority should include the ability to require action before a
physical or cyber national security incident has occurred,” LaFleur
said in a Tuesday letter. Any new authority, she said, should not
impede FERC’s existing authority to work with the North
American Electric Reliability Corp. to set reliability standards for
the grid, a process that can often take months to complete.

2014-02-10
A multi-agency government task force looking into cyberattacks
against retailers says it has not come across evidence suggesting
the attacks are a coordinated campaign to adversely affect the

economic impact to private business and individual citizens cannot
be overstated.

Study: Pentagon Fuel Supply at Risk of Hack
2014-02-07
The Pentagon should take a page from the Department of
Homeland Security’s cyber defense playbook for energy
infrastructure to guard against electronic assault on its fuel supply
chain, according to a new study.
The Defense Department’s use of unsecured networks to oversee
the distribution of fuel and other logistical activities has left it
vulnerable to the same kind of malware-based cyberattack that
crippled 30,000 computers in oil giant Saudi Aramco’s networks in
2012, according to “Hacks on Gas: Energy, Cybersecurity and U.S.
Defense,” a report written by Christopher Bronk, a fellow in IT
policy at Rice University’s Baker Institute. He produced the report
for the U.S. Army War College’s Strategic Studies Institute.

Study: Most Security Pros Unsure Whether They Could
Handle A Breach
2014-02-13
A survey conducted by the Ponemon Institute and sponsored by
security company AccessData reports that many security pros are
worried that they would not know the root cause of a breach, or
that they would be able to prioritize their responses. “When a CEO
and board of directors asks a security team for a briefing
immediately following an incident, 65 percent of respondents
believe that the briefing would be purposefully modified, filtered or
watered down” because of a lack of information, the study says.
“Additionally, 78 percent of respondents believe most CISOs
would make a ‘best effort guess’ based on limited information,
and they would also take action prematurely and report that the
problem had been resolved without this actually being the case.”

‘The Mask’ Cyber Spying Operation Targets
Government Agencies
2014-02-11
Security researchers have uncovered a cyber-espionage campaign
called Careto, or The Mask, that has been targeting government
agencies, energy companies and activists in 31 countries for
seven years. The campaign, which appears to have been authored
by Spanish attackers, is one of the most advanced global
cyber-espionage operations to date, according to Kaspersky Lab’s
security research team. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/

Cyber Contest Hones Military Cadets’ Skills
2014-02-06
The U.S. Defense Department launched a new competition to
promote cybersecurity education and training in the nation’s
military service academies. Beginning last November, the three
service academies created teams to compete in the Service
Academy Cyber Stakes, which culminated in a major interschool
event held over the weekend of February 1-2 at the Carnegie
Mellon campus in Pittsburgh.
For some years, the Defense Department has been working to
increase the number of cybersecurity personnel. One major goal is
to have some 4,000 specialists trained by 2017. To get the number
and quality of cyber experts needed, the Defense Department has
focused on training and educating—especially for future officers
who will be charged with defending national cyber assets.

Critical Infrastructure Cyber Bill Moves Forward
2014-02-05
The latest round of cybersecurity legislation is moving ahead in the
House, with the Homeland Security Committee on Feb. 5
approving a bill by voice vote that seeks to protect critical
infrastructure and codify information-sharing practices. According
to a summary of the bill, the measure would formalize numerous
existing government cybersecurity efforts, such as
information-sharing initiatives between the public and private
sectors and assessments of the cyber workforce. It would also
strengthen the National Cybersecurity and Communications
Integration Center and prohibit new regulatory authorities at
agencies, particularly the Department of Homeland Security.

Air Force Researchers Plant Rootkit In A PLC
2014-01-27
Researchers with the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT)
have created a prototype rootkit that can sit undetected in the
firmware of a programmable logic controller (PLC) device and
corrupt utility and plant floor operations.

PLCs -- which run various industrial processes from spinning
centrifuges of uranium to operating amusement park rides -traditionally have not been built with security in mind, and little if
any technology exists to track or detect rogue code running
on them.

Electric Utility Cybersecurity Regulations have a
Serial Problem
2014-01-24
A class of SCADA vulnerabilities discussed at a recent conference
is getting attention not only for the risks they pose to master control
systems at electric utilities, but also for illuminating a dangerous
gap in important critical infrastructure regulations.
“Where serial lines come into a master station, for instance, they
won’t have the same level of protection that a TCP/IP-based
connection would have,” said Michael Toecker, an ICS security
consultant and engineer at Digital Bond. “There’s a complete
regulatory blind spot there in the current version of the
NERC standards.”

Machine Resiliency as a Defense
2014-01-21
In 2014, the PC you unbox and provision on your network is
likely to be a better machine, better able to withstand attack, more
resilient than a PC of just a few years ago.
Those improvements are the result of efforts and investments
in security assurance from OSVs, ISVs, OEMs and hardware
suppliers. Let’s take BIOS, for example. BIOS isn’t often fodder
for headlines, but it matters. BIOS is the low level firmware that
controls machine operations before the OS takes control. Even less
visible is the BIOS’s contribution to system security in testing,
verifying and authenticating the hardware to ensure it has not
been compromised.

would-be hackers.
In the study, which was published in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), the research team said
nations around the world are cataloging defects in Internet security
systems not already identified by someone else – also known
as “zero-day exploits.” The researchers focused their model on

COORDINATED VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE
ICS-CERT actively encourages researchers and ICS vendors to use a coordinated vulnerability disclosure process when possible. Ideally,
this coordinated disclosure process allows time for a vendor to develop and release patches, and for users to test and deploy patches prior
to public vulnerability disclosure. While this process is not always followed for a variety of reasons, ICS-CERT continues to promote this
as a desirable goal.
Bridging the communication gap between researchers and vendors, as well as coordinating with our CERT/CC and US-CERT partners,
has yielded excellent results for both the researchers and vendors. To learn more about working with ICS-CERT in this coordinated
disclosure process, please contact ICS-CERT at ics-cert@hq.dhs.gov or toll free at 1-877-776-7585.
