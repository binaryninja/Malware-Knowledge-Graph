Chimera, APT19 under the radar ?
Initital approach
At the beginning I studied a suspicious DLL uploaded on Anyrun, this
one have been tagged as "Malformatted PE header". By the fact that
some Threat Actor let theirs DLL with an invalid header for avoiding to
correctly run in sandbox or in AV sandbox and modify it for run by a
loader (side-loading with multiples files [Header + DLL], script for
rebuilding the header...).
As the first look, we can see the anomaly on the PE header based on
redirection to a part of malware.

1/23

The timestamp is valid if we compare to the other sections (proving that
doesn't modified), the internal name in the import section and the
exported functions are the same that used by Meterpreter as reflective
loader method.

2/23

On seeing the assembly code of the header, we can see the multiples
operation for parse by the stack pointer for load the export section which
content the Meterpreter shellcode.

3/23

We can note the characteristic entrypoint of Cobalt Strike with the three
accepts calls and one close socket.

5/23

We can observe the SMB pipe used as pivoting method for the implant to
run.

Looking at the TTPs and the anomaly on the PE header, I make the
parallel with the APT chimera report, a group that targeted the semiconductor sector in Taiwan. I had written the Yara rule with the full part of
the anomaly and posted on Twitter.

Hunting
Few times after release a compact analysis, I think to use my Yara rule for
hunting additionals samples with differents levels on condition, for detect
if by example, a new variant reuse a part of the indicators (which can be
the oldest or more recent). By the way of improving this specter of results
and reduce the load on the Yara rule, I have removed a part of the
anomaly just before the manipulation of the RSP (stack pointer).

Due to the numbers of results, I had only got last month of hits on
Virustotal but quickly some different types of Cobalt Strike are identified
in two major famillies :
With the standard ReflectiveLoader reference in export table.
Have not the reference but use custom way by ordinal or execute
function.
The last one has been splited between recent (2019-2020) and old (20172018) for links to the period of samples analyzed on the chimera report
(maybe a variant not analysed).
The first result in the compiled the informations on the samples in the
different groups, show that multiple pairs of samples can observed with
the same VHash, date of compilation of the DLL and size of the files.
VHash being based on imports, exports and the header for the PE, this
insensitive unlike a simple modification of an IP address of a payload and
allow to confirm that reuse the code.

Now, this the time that each analyst hate, the time to found the samples
(Ask to Virustotal theirs prices for get the samples and cry). Fortunately,

9/23

almost a sample of each pair could be found on the public sandbox (36
samples on 74).
At the first sample analysed, the sample content the same combo Cobalt
Strike and Meterpreter but have a persistence method by .NET client by
local IP, localhost (in the infrastructure) or with an external IP or domain
(initial compromisation point).

In searching in the archives that match with the TTPs and the strings, I
found the Yara rule of APT19 that use a combo Cobalt Strike +
Meterpreter as implant for pivoting the infrastructure of the victim.

This uses an well-known fileless UAC bypass using Event Viewer
technique and maintain the persistence in the key, this spawn a

10/23

Meterpreter instance in loading the DLL inside the beacon, we can
recognize the part for initiating the communication in getting the system
informations.

12/23

But now this beginning to become interesting, in comparing the both PE,
we can observe a lot of differences on the structures of the payload due
to the comparison is between each byte on the sequence order but the
structure have common bytes in the anomaly in the header path.

We can see the differences on the implementation of the stack pointer in
using destination index for copy the data of the instructions for load the
shellcode of the Meterpreter DLL.

13/23

After this I have created a little script for extract each first part of PE
header (4D 5A to 00 00 00 0E), get all unique the signature, attribute an ID
to the signature an this time, attribute all the ID generated to the samples
that have the same signature for display pairs of samples with the same
modifications. On the results, we note all the samples have splited in two
sections in having the same similarities in the header of the PE (here on
the samples with content the ReflectiveLoader reference).

14/23

By seeing the comparison between several samples of the same pair, we
can note a code reuse at 98% between each sample, only the 2% which
remains are due to the declaration or not of the IP address or domain for
the pivot. This explains by the fact of the sample as compiled at the same
time or use the same template like Cobalt Strike is a template that can be
edited for use a custom DLL to load. Here on a pair of the Chimera
samples :

Same result on a pair of the APT19 samples :

15/23

Liking said previously only the configuration change but the rest is the
same due to this build on a template.

16/23

Few times after the report of APT19, the group have deleted the export
reference in using ordinal way used for allow to use the beacon of Cobalt
Strike with a custom DLL. This has by example rename as "execute".

17/23

The group use this way only for changing the static reference in the
export table but kept the Meterpreter DLL as implant to run.

Some samples tagged as APT 19 have the EICAR-TEST string to suggest
a detection of a test software for the SOC managers of the targeted
companies.We must not forget that if now this technique can be trival and
should be notified to fight against distraction measures towards the
detection of the tool, in 2016 - 2017, it isn't so well known and was very
effective during the pentests so for APT, I'll let you guess.

The most recent samples on the same family of APT 19 hide theirs
references to the ReflectiveLoader reference in going to the Ordinal way
for the custom DLL few time after have been reported by Threat
Intelligences companies on theirs reports.The most recent Chimera
samples have done the same modification since 1st August 2020 in using
External domain or IP, Internal IP or localhost for have an elevated
session like on Active Directory machines.

tcp://192.168.233.129:4444
tcp://hash-37257.portmap.io:37257

Difficult to say if the both groups are the same but a lot of commons
behaviour and TTPs can be observed. I estimated that more 200 samples
have been detected by the Thor rule as Chimera in the last six months
can be also linked to APT19 samples that detected by the common part of
the anomaly on the header. On compiling all the data, we can see the
common part and the little variant code but also that match with the
VHash and pairs that we have detected at the beginning of the analysis.

A list of data that can be queried is available here
It should be remembered that the way groups linked to government work
are sporadic groups linked only to a project like small teams. With this in
mind, it is easy to recognize similarities because they are probably the
same people and as soon as there is a different news, this classed as a
new APT group but nobody remembers Thrip, Calypso ... that use lot
similatires with APT10 or APT3 but have just a RAT or a small
modification of a PE ?
