Research by Siddartha Sharma and Ashwin Vamshi
Uptycs' threat research team has discovered a new Botnet named ‚ÄòSimps‚Äô attributed to
Keksec group primarily focussed on DDOS activities. We discovered the Simps Botnet
binaries downloaded via shell script sample and Remote Code Execution vulnerability
exploits by Gafgyt - detailed in our earlier post.
Based on our analysis and threat intelligence, we have the following observations:
Simps Botnet binary uses Mirai and Gafgyt modules for DDOS functionality
The Botnet might be in the early stages of development because of the presence of the
infected.log file after execution
The author behind this Botnet has a Youtube channel and Discord Server for the usage
and demonstration of the Botnet
The Youtube channel and the historical data provided evidence that Simps Botnet is
active since April 2021
The Discord server discussions and threat intel data provided us evidence of the
possible association of Simps Botnet to Keksec group

This post will cover details on our discovery, threat intelligence data attributing relations to
Keksec group, working of the binaries and the code similarity, and reuse modules of Simps
Botnet.

Discovery of Simps Botnet
During the first week of May 2021, the Uptycs‚Äô threat research team detected a shell script
and Gafgyt malware downloading Simps binaries from the same C2- 23.95.80[.]200.

Shell script downloading Simps binary
The shell script (hash:
c2d5e54544742b7a1b04cf45047859a10bb90c6945d340120872f575aa866e6d), ‚Äòur0a.sh‚Äô
was downloaded from the C2 URL 23.95.80[.]200.
The script downloaded several next stage payloads for several *nix architectures from the
open directory named ‚ÄúSimps‚Äù in the same C2 URL from where the shell script was
downloaded (see Figure 1)

Figure 1: Malicious Shell script dropping payloads
The script performs the following:
1. Uses Wget to fetch the payloads from 23.95.80[.]200 in simps directory to tmp.
2. Changes permission using chmod.
3. Deletion of the payloads using the command rm.
On execution of the Simps binary, it drops a log file containing that the device has been
infected with malware by Simps Botnet (see Figure 2)

The binary also connects to the C2 23.95.80[.]200 (see figure 3)

Gafgyt downloading Simps binary
During this same time, Gafgyt binary (hash:
e847dfbd831df6015519d03d42ada8241ce1174e9bd96f405452627617229c63) was also
downloading Simps binary from the same C2 URL. The Simps payload was delivered by
exploiting multiple Remote Code Execution vulnerabilities in vulnerable IOT devices. An
excerpt of Realtek and Linksys router exploits downloading the next stage payloads. (see
Figure 4 and 5)

Both these exploits downloaded a Simps MIPS UPX packed binary (hash 6d18b433183fc68cd7b731fed198732d3460a21afba53163f059152bd410b55f), for MIPS
architecture which also displays a message that the device has been infected by Simps
Botnet (see Figure 6)

Simps Botnet - Youtube channel and Discord server
While looking into the historical data of our threat intelligence systems and passive DNS
records, we identified several malicious URLs (hash in IOCs section below) downloading a
shell script named ur0a.sh and containing Simps next stage payloads. Another commonality
was the Simps Botnet infection log message. Searching for these common entries led us to a
YouTube video titled ‚ÄúSimps Botnet , Slamming!!!‚Äù, created by a user named ‚Äúitz UR0A''
created on 24 April 2021. (see Figure 7)

The Youtube link also contained a Discord server link of ‚ÄúUR0A‚Äù, which was also present in
the infection log. (see Figure 8)

Keksec attribution with Simps Botnet
The Discord server contained several discussions around DDOS activities and Botnets
carrying different names. One binary we identified in a chat conversation named gay.x86
(hash: e258a284d5cad584a14df27f022c99515de1cec69ab3157640d1ce7584c50ecd).
Upon execution, it displayed a message that the system is pawned by md5hashguy (see
Figure 9)

Figure 9: Discord message
We also came across another Gafgyt malware from a Joesandbox report, that contained the
Infected By Simps Botnet ;) message. This malware dropped a file name
‚Äúkeksec.infected.you.log‚Äù that contained a message ‚Äúyouve been infected by urmommy,
thanks for joining keksec..‚Äù (see Figure 10)

Figure 10: keksec.infected.you.log file
Interestingly, the same Discord server also contained an users named ‚Äúurmommy‚Äù and
‚Äú698a20e0da24bcebca57f09b7d695f8d#2881‚Äù who actively involved in DDOS activities and
Botnet discussions. All this data gathered tied reactions Simps Botnet and the Discord server
users related to Keksec group. This group is also referred as Kek Security, which according
to NSFOCUS is a group which operates HybridMQ-keksec, a Botnet created with Trojan
programs. HybridMQ-keksec is a DDoS Trojan program obtained by combining and
modifying the source code of Mirai and Gafgyt.‚Äù

Similarly, Simps binaries also have the Valve source Engine and OVH modules which were
also seen in a variant of Gafgyt that targeted Huawei and Asus Routers and killed its rival IoT
Botnets. The code similarity of the Valve source Engine module used by Simps was similar to
Gafgyt. (see Figure 13)

Uptycs EDR Detections
Uptycs‚Äô EDR capabilities, armed with YARA process scanning, detected Simps downloader
shell-script activity (See Figure 13) and the Simps ELF binary with a threat score of 10/10
(See Figure 14).

Additionally, Uptycs‚Äô EDR also detects the outbound connection of the malware C2 URLs via
our threat intelligence.

Conclusion
Our research initially started with the discovery and analysis of Simps Botnet binaries used
for DDOS activities. Using Uptycs‚Äô EDR, threat intelligence data and Open-source
intelligence (OSINT) we were able to tie relations and attribute Simps Botnet to the Keksec
group. The Uptycs threat research team has reported the associated Discord server, Youtube
and Github links to the concerned entities. We will continue to monitor the developments of
this group and share updates.
We recommend the following measures for enterprise users and administrators to identify
and protect against such attacks
Regularly monitor the suspicious processes, events, and network traffic spawned on
the execution of any untrusted binary / scripts.
Always be cautious in executing shell-scripts from unknown or untrusted sources.
Keep systems and firmware updated with the latest releases and patches.
