THREAT INSIGHTS REPORT
Q4 2020
THREAT LANDSCAPE
Welcome to the Q4 2020 edition of the HP-Bromium Threat Insights Report. The report reviews notable malware
trends identiﬁed by HP Sure Click from the fourth quarter of 2020 (1 October to 31 December), so that security teams are
equipped with the knowledge to combat emerging threats and improve their security postures.
HP Sure Click Enterprise is deployed on desktops and laptops, capturing malware and allowing it to run inside secure
containers called micro-virtual machines.¹ Adding isolation to the endpoint security stack transforms your endpoints into
your strongest defence, while giving network defenders a unique advantage to be able to track and understand malware
that tries to enter your networks.

NOTABLE THREATS
Dridex Surges in Q4
Q4 2020 saw a signiﬁcant increase in malicious spam distributing
Dridex malware.² The number of Dridex samples isolated by HP Sure
Click more than tripled in Q4 compared to Q3, representing a 239%
increase. According to HP Sure Click telemetry, Dridex was the
second most widely circulating crimeware family behind Emotet.
Although originating in 2012 as a banking Trojan, since 2017 Dridex’s
operators have increasingly shifted their tactics to extorting money
from victims using ransomware.

239%

rise in Dridex samples
isolated by HP Sure Click
in Q4 2020, compared to Q3

Dridex’s distributors commonly propagate the malware using malicious Excel spreadsheets that download the Trojan from
remote web servers. The proportion of spreadsheet malware increased by 9% in Q4 compared to Q3 (Figure 5), which was
partially driven by the uptick in Dridex activity. Interestingly, since mid-2020 some Dridex loader documents started to
contain hundreds of URLs from which to download the malware. Consequently, the high number of potential download
servers makes the loader more resilient to takedown action by hosting providers and domain registrars. It also increases
the likelihood of successfully downloading the payload. Instead of blocking one URL, network security controls such as
web proxies would need to block hundreds of URLs to prevent the malware from being downloaded and executed.

Malicious Executable Email Attachments
on the Rise
The volume of executable format malware,
especially Portable Executable EXE ﬁles, isolated by
HP Sure Click in Q4 grew by 12%, compared to Q3
(Figure 8). This increase was primarily driven a rise
in malicious email campaigns distributing
attachments using these ﬁle types. In particular,
we saw large campaigns targeting German users
delivering Formbook and Agent Tesla remote
access Trojans (RATs).³ ⁴ The sender addresses were
spoofed to make it appear that they originated from
legitimate German companies. The emails lured
victims into opening the attachments by claiming
they were monetary grants or orders.

Q4 2020
Web Browser Exploits Lead to FickerStealer
In November 2020, HP Threat Research identiﬁed a
malware campaign relying on misspelled domains of
popular instant messaging services. Visitors to the
websites were redirected to RigEK landing pages that
attempted to exploit web browser and plugin vulnerabilities
to infect their systems with FickerStealer malware.⁵
RigEK is an exploit kit that was ﬁrst seen in 2014, but
saw a big decline in 2017.⁶ After being redirected to a
RigEK landing page, the victim’s web browser and
operating system is proﬁled for vulnerable browser and
plugin versions, including Flash, Java and Silverlight. If a
vulnerable version is found and other environmental
criteria are met, RigEK delivers an exploit. Following
exploitation, a PowerShell script writes an obfuscated
JScript ﬁle to the user’s %Temp% directory, which
downloads the ﬁnal malware payload using a
WinHttpRequest object.

exploitation of Internet Explorer 11 by RigEK in a micro-VM.

FickerStealer is a family of information stealing malware that emerged in October 2020 on Russian-language underground
forums. Its capabilities include stealing sensitive information such as passwords, browser autocomplete forms and
cryptocurrency wallets.

APOMacroSploit, a New Oﬃce Malware Builder Emerges
In Q4 2020, we detected a previously unseen Oﬃce malware builder called APOMacroSploit that was used to target users
through malicious spam campaigns. The emails adopted delivery-themed lures that distributed weaponised XLS
attachments (Figures 3 and 4). The documents contained Excel 4 macros that download and run remotely-hosted BAT
scripts using PowerShell’s Net.WebClient.DownloadFile method. To collect information about the campaign, the threat
actors used a legitimate hyperlink shortening and analytics service called
cutt[.]ly. Ultimately, the batch scripts led to BitRAT being deployed to the
victims’ computers.⁷ Advertisements for BitRAT and APOMacroSploit
were spotted in several underground forums and chatrooms in 2020.
According to a message from one of APOMacroSploit’s sellers, each
document costs $50 USD.⁸

Q4 2020
ZLoader Makes a Return using Password-protected Oﬃce Loaders
In October 2020, HP Sure Click telemetry detected an increase in ZLoader banking Trojan activity.⁹ Its distributors used a
combination of techniques to increase the likelihood of compromising systems. Some of the loaders were Word documents
that cause a VBA macro to run only after the documents are closed. They used a topical lure by purporting to be invoices
from a pharmaceutical company involved in clinical trials. The macros deobfuscated, dropped and executed ZLoader
payload DLLs to randomly-named folders in the C:\ directory without needing to download the Trojan from a distribution
server.
The attackers behind this campaign also used password-protected Excel ﬁles. This can be an eﬀective way of slowing
down investigations that rely on conventional sandboxes because security teams must retrieve the email containing the
password to examine the document. HP Sure Click speeds up investigations because it captures a full behavioural trace of
activity when the document is opened by a user. Figures 5 and 6 shows how a user clicked on a link leading to a web server
(secureﬁles[.]top) hosting a ZLoader Excel document. After downloading the ﬁle, the user opened it and entered the
password, which caused a ZLoader DLL to be dropped and executed inside a micro-VM.

Emotet Email Thread Hijacking
One reason for Emotet’s high infection rate was how its operators automated the creation of targeted phishing emails
using data stolen from victims. By exﬁltrating victims’ email mailboxes, the botnet was able to spoof sender addresses,
subject lines, attachment ﬂlenames and the body text of emails. This information was used to craft convincing phishing
emails that would be sent as replies to existing email threads, a technique called email thread hijacking. Ultimately, the
emails sought to trick targets into opening malicious email attachments or clicking on links leading to malicious documents
that would infect their systems with Emotet. In December 2020, HP Sure Click isolated an Emotet phishing email targeting
a government organisation in Central America. The email bore the hallmarks of being crafted using mailbox data stolen
from a PC infected with Emotet, which was then used to email the recipient (Figure 7).

NOTABLE TECHNIQUES
DOSfuscation in Emotet Downloaders
Before law enforcement seized Emotet’s command and control infrastructure in January 2021, we noticed that its
operators increased the complexity of the obfuscation used in their Word downloaders (Figure 8).¹⁰ Samples in December
2020 shared many similarities to DOSfuscation techniques, a collection of command line argument obfuscation methods
described by Daniel Bohannon in 2018.¹¹ The goal of these techniques is to evade rigid detection rules by hiding suspicious
strings from command line arguments. While the Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) in Windows 10 has improved visibility
into obfuscated scripts, determined attackers can apply these techniques to interpreted languages that aren’t supported
by AMSI. Telltale indicators of DOSfuscation include using environmental variable substrings, character insertions,
reversals and for-loop encoding.

ACTIONABLE INTELLIGENCE
Notable Trends
Q4 2020 saw threat actors switch from Word document malware to
spreadsheet and executable formats, such as EXE, XLS and XLSM
(Figure 9). The most eﬀective execution techniques involved old
technologies such as Excel 4.0 macros that often oﬀer limited
visibility to detection tools.
In line with the rest of 2020, the most frequent exploit isolated by
HP Sure Click - accounting for nearly three-quarters of all
exploits - was of CVE-2017-11882, a memory corruption
vulnerability in Microsoft Oﬃce’s Equation Editor.¹² There was a
12% growth in malware that exploits CVE-2017-0199, a Microsoft
Word remote code execution vulnerability (Figure 10).¹³

88%

of threats isolated by
HP Sure Click were delivered
by email in Q4 2020. The
remaining 12% were web
downloads.

Of the threats stopped by HP Sure Click in Q4 2020, 29% were not known by hash to antivirus scanning engines when they
were isolated, suggesting a high degree of sample novelty due to widespread use of packers and polymorphic and
metamorphic obfuscation techniques. On average, it took 8.8 days for samples to become known by hash to other antivirus
engines.
68 adversary techniques documented in the MITRE ATT&CK matrix were seen in this period.¹⁴ The most popular techniques
used by threats were Execution through Module Load (T1129), Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027) and Execution
through API (T1106).

HP Sure Click Enterprise Recommendations
HP Sure Click Enterprise enhances protection because malware is isolated from the host computer and cannot spread onto
the corporate network. We recommend updating to the latest HP Sure Click Enterprise software release and using the
Operational and Threat Dashboards in HP Sure Controller to ensure isolation is running correctly on your endpoints.
In your HP Sure Click Enterprise policy, we recommend that untrusted ﬁle support for email clients and Microsoft Oﬃce
protection options are enabled (these are enabled by default in our recommended policies). Switching on these settings is
an easy way to reduce the risk of infection posed by phishing campaigns. Please contact HP Support if you need help
applying suggested conﬁgurations.
