Nibiru ransomware variant decryptor

Nikhil Hegde developed this tool.

Weak encryption
The Nibiru ransomware is a .NET-based malware family. It traverses directories in the local
disks, encrypts files with Rijndael-256 and gives them a .Nibiru extension. Rijndael-256 is a
secure encryption algorithm. However, Nibiru uses a hard-coded string "Nibiru" to compute
the 32-byte key and 16-byte IV values. The decryptor program leverages this weakness to
decrypt files encrypted by this variant.

Ransomware
Nibiru ransomware is a poorly executed ransomware variant. It traverses directories and
encrypts files with Rijndael-256. The files are given an extension, .Nibiru, after encryption.
The ransomware targets numerous common file extensions but skips critical directories like
Program Files, Windows and System Volume Information.
Extensions targeted by Nibiru:
