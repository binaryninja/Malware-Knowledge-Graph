Motto: “Beware of Regin, the master! His heart is poisoned. He would be thy bane…“
“The Story of Siegfried” by James Baldwin

Introduction, history
Download our full Regin paper (PDF).
In the spring of 2012, following a Kaspersky Lab presentation on the unusual facts surrounding the
Duqu malware, a security researcher contacted us and mentioned that Duqu reminded him of another
high-end malware incident. Although he couldn’t share a sample, the third-party researcher mentioned
the “Regin” name, a malware attack that is now dreaded by many security administrators in
governmental agencies around the world.

1/12

For the past two years, we’ve been tracking this most elusive malware across the world. From time to
time, samples would appear on various multi-scanner services, but they were all unrelated to each
other, cryptic in functionality and lacking context.
It’s unknown exactly when the first samples of Regin were created. Some of them have timestamps
dating back to 2003.
The victims of Regin fall into the following categories:
Telecom operators
Government institutions
Multi-national political bodies
Financial institutions
Research institutions
Individuals involved in advanced mathematical/cryptographical research
So far, we’ve observed two main objectives from the attackers:
Intelligence gathering
Facilitating other types of attacks
While in most cases, the attackers were focused on extracting sensitive information, such as e-mails
and documents, we have observed cases where the attackers compromised telecom operators to
enable the launch of additional sophisticated attacks. More about this in the GSM Targeting section
below.
Perhaps one of the most publicly known victims of Regin is Jean Jacques Quisquater
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Quisquater), a well-known Belgian cryptographer. In
February 2014, Quisquater announced he was the victim of a sophisticated cyber intrusion incident. We
were able to obtain samples from the Quisquater case and confirm they belong to the Regin platform.
Another interesting victim of Regin is a computer we are calling “The Magnet of Threats“. This
computer belongs to a research institution and has been attacked by Turla, Mask/Careto, Regin,
Itaduke, Animal Farm and some other advanced threats that do not have a public name, all coexisting happily on the same computer at some point.

Initial compromise and lateral movement
The exact method of the initial compromise remains a mystery, although several theories exist, which
include man-in-the-middle attacks with browser zero-day exploits. For some of the victims, we
observed tools and modules designed for lateral movement. So far, we have not encountered any
exploits. The replication modules are copied to remote computers by using Windows administrative
shares and then executed. Obviously, this technique requires administrative privileges inside the
victim’s network. In several cases, the infected machines were also Windows domain controllers.
Targeting of system administrators via web-based exploits is one simple way of achieving immediate
administrative access to the entire network.

The Regin platform

2/12

In short, Regin is a cyber-attack platform which the attackers deploy in the victim networks for ultimate
remote control at all possible levels.
The platform is extremely modular in nature and has multiple stages.

Regin platform diagram
The first stage (“stage 1”) is generally the only executable file that will appear in victim’ systems.
Further stages are stored either directly on the hard drive (for 64 bit systems), as NTFS Extended
Attributes or registry entries. We’ve observed many different stage 1 modules, which sometimes have
been merged with public sources to achieve a type of polymorphism, complicating the detection
process.
The second stage has multiple purposes and can remove the Regin infection from the system if
instructed so by the 3rd stage.
The second stage also creates a marker file that can be used to identify the infected machine. Known
filenames for this marker are:
%SYSTEMROOT%\system32\nsreg1.dat
%SYSTEMROOT%\system32\bssec3.dat
%SYSTEMROOT%\system32\msrdc64.dat
Stage 3 exists only on 32 bit systems – on 64 bit systems, stage 2 loads the dispatcher directly,
skipping the third stage.
Stage 4, the dispatcher, is perhaps the most complex single module of the entire platform. The
dispatcher is the user-mode core of the framework. It is loaded directly as the third stage of the 64-bit
bootstrap process or extracted and loaded from the VFS as module 50221 as the fourth stage on 32-bit
systems.

3/12

The dispatcher takes care of the most complicated tasks of the Regin platform, such as providing an
API to access virtual file systems, basic communications and storage functions as well as network
transport sub-routines. In essence, the dispatcher is the brain that runs the entire platform.
A thorough description of all malware stages can be found in our full technical paper.

Virtual File Systems (32/64-bit)
The most interesting code from the Regin platform is stored in encrypted file storages, known as Virtual
File Systems (VFSes).
During our analysis we were able to obtain 24 VFSes, from multiple victims around the world.
Generally, these have random names and can be located in several places in the infected system. For
a full list, including format of the Regin VFSes, see our technical paper.

Unusual modules and artifacts
With high-end APT groups such as the one behind Regin, mistakes are very rare. Nevertheless, they
do happen. Some of the VFSes we analyzed contain words which appear to be the respective
codenames of the modules deployed on the victim:
legspinv2.6 and LEGSPINv2.6
WILLISCHECKv2.0
HOPSCOTCH
Another module we found, which is a plugin type 55001.0 references another codename, which is
U_STARBUCKS:

GSM Targeting
The most interesting aspect we found so far about Regin is related to an infection of a large GSM
operator. One VFS encrypted entry we located had internal id 50049.2 and appears to be an activity log
on a GSM Base Station Controller.

4/12

From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_station_subsystem
According to the GSM documentation (http://www.telecomabc.com/b/bsc.html): “The Base Station
Controller (BSC) is in control of and supervises a number of Base Transceiver Stations (BTS). The
BSC is responsible for the allocation of radio resources to a mobile call and for the handovers that are
made between base stations under his control. Other handovers are under control of the MSC.”
Here’s a look at the decoded Regin GSM activity log:

This log is about 70KB in size and contains hundreds of entries like the ones above. It also includes
timestamps which indicate exactly when the command was executed.

5/12

The entries in the log appear to contain Ericsson OSS MML (Man-Machine Language as defined by
ITU-T) commands.
Here’s a list of some commands issued on the Base Station Controller, together with some of their
timestamps:

2008-05-12 17:28:29: rrtpp:trapool=all;

Descriptions for the commands:
rxmop – check software version type;
rxmsp – list current call forwarding settings of the Mobile Station;
6/12

rlcrp – list off call forwarding settings for the Base Station Controller;
rxble – enable (unblock) call forwarding;
rxtcp – show the Transceiver Group of particular cell;
allip – show external alarm;
dtstp – show DIgital Path (DIP) settings (DIP is the name of the function used for supervision of
the connected PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) lines);
rlstc – activate cell(s) in the GSM network;
rlstp – stop cell(s) in the GSM network;
rlmfc – add frequencies to the active broadcast control channel allocation list;
rlnri – add cell neightbour;
rrtpp – show radio transmission transcoder pool details;
The log seems to contain not only the executed commands but also usernames and passwords of
some engineering accounts:
sed[snip]:Alla[snip] hed[snip]:Bag[snip] oss:New[snip] administrator:Adm[snip] nss1:Eric[snip]
In total, the log indicates that commands were executed on 136 different cells. Some of the cell names
include “prn021a, gzn010a, wdk004, kbl027a, etc…“. The command log we obtained covers a period
of about one month, from April 25, 2008 through May 27, 2008. It is unknown why the commands
stopped in May 2008 though; perhaps the infection was removed or the attackers achieved their
objective and moved on. Another explanation is that the attackers improved or changed the malware to
stop saving logs locally and that’s why only some older logs were discovered.

Communication and C&C
The C&C mechanism implemented in Regin is extremely sophisticated and relies on communication
drones deployed by the attackers throughout the victim networks. Most victims communicate with
another machine in their own internal network, through various protocols, as specified in the config file.
These include HTTP and Windows network pipes. The purpose of such a complex infrastructure is to
achieve two goals: give attackers access deep into the network, potentially bypassing air gaps and
restrict as much as possible the traffic to the C&C.
Here’s a look at the decoded configurations:
1

17.3.40.101 transport 50037 0 0 y.y.y.5:80 ; transport 50051 217.y.y.yt:443

2

17.3.40.93 transport 50035 217.x.x.x:443 ; transport 50035 217.x.x.x:443

3

50.103.14.80 transport 27 203.199.89.80 ; transport 50035 194.z.z.z:8080

4

51.9.1.3 transport 50035 192.168.3.3:445 ; transport 50035 192.168.3.3:9322

5

18.159.0.1 transport 50271 DC ; transport 50271 DC

In the above table, we see configurations extracted from several victims that bridge together infected
machines in what appears to be virtual networks: 17.3.40.x, 50.103.14.x, 51.9.1.x, 18.159.0.x. One of
these routes reaches out to the “external” C&C server at 203.199.89.80.

7/12

The numbers right after the “transport” indicate the plugin that handles the communication. These are
in our case:
27 – ICMP network listener using raw sockets
50035 – Winsock-based network transport
50037 – Network transport over HTTP
50051 – Network transport over HTTPS
50271 – Network transport over SMB (named pipes)
The machines located on the border of the network act as routers, effectively connecting victims from
inside the network with C&Cs on the internet.
After decoding all the configurations we’ve collected, we were able to identify the following external
C&Cs.

Perceval S.a.

One particular case includes a country in the Middle East. This case was mind-blowing so we thought
it’s important to present it. In this specific country, all the victims we identified communicate with each
other, forming a peer-to-peer network. The P2P network includes the president’s office, a research
center, educational institution network and a bank.
These victims spread across the country are all interconnected to each other. One of the victims
contains a translation drone which has the ability to forward the packets outside of the country, to the
C&C in India.
This represents a rather interesting command-and-control mechanism, which is guaranteed to raise
very little suspicions. For instance, if all commands to the president’s office are sent through the bank’s
network, then all the malicious traffic visible for the president’s office sysadmins will be only with the
bank, in the same country.

Victim Statistics
Over the past two years, we collected statistics about the attacks and victims of Regin. These were
aided by the fact that even after the malware is uninstalled, certain artifacts are left behind which can
help identify an infected (but cleaned) system. For instance, we’ve seen several cases where the
systems were cleaned but the “msrdc64.dat” infection marker was left behind.

9/12

So far, victims of Regin were identified in 14 countries:
Algeria
Afghanistan
Belgium
Brazil
Fiji
Germany
Iran
India
Indonesia
Kiribati
Malaysia
Pakistan
Russia
Syria
In total, we counted 27 different victims, although it should be pointed out that the definition of a
victim here refers to a full entity, including their entire network. The number of unique PCs infected with
Regin is of course much, much higher.
From the map above, Fiji and Kiribati are unusual, because we rarely see such advanced malware in
such remote, small countries. In particular, the victim in Kiribati is most unusual. To put this into context,
Kiribati is a small island in the Pacific, with a population around 100,000.

Attribution
Considering the complexity and cost of Regin development, it is likely that this operation is supported
by a nation-state. While attribution remains a very difficult problem when it comes to professional
attackers such as those behind Regin, certain metadata extracted from the samples might still be
relevant.

As this information could be easily altered by the developers, it’s up to the reader to attempt to interpret
this: as an intentional false flag or a non-critical indicator left by the developers.

Conclusions
For more than a decade, a sophisticated group known as Regin has targeted high-profile entities
around the world with an advanced malware platform. As far as we can tell, the operation is still active,
although the malware may have been upgraded to more sophisticated versions. The most recent
sample we’ve seen was from a 64-bit infection. This infection was still active in the spring of 2014.
The name Regin is apparently a reversed “In Reg”, short for “In Registry”, as the malware can store its
modules in the registry. This name and detections first appeared in anti-malware products around
March 2011.
From some points of view, the platform reminds us of another sophisticated malware: Turla. Some
similarities include the use of virtual file systems and the deployment of communication drones to
bridge networks together. Yet through their implementation, coding methods, plugins, hiding techniques

11/12

and flexibility, Regin surpasses Turla as one of the most sophisticated attack platforms we have ever
analysed.
The ability of this group to penetrate and monitor GSM networks is perhaps the most unusual and
interesting aspect of these operations. In today’s world, we have become too dependent on mobile
phone networks which rely on ancient communication protocols with little or no security available for
the end user. Although all GSM networks have mechanisms embedded which allow entities such as
law enforcement to track suspects, there are other parties which can gain this ability and further abuse
them to launch other types of attacks against mobile users.
