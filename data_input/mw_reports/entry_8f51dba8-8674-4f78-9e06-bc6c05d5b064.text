Apple has released today security updates to address two zero-day vulnerabilities that were
exploited in the wild to hack older generation iPhones and iPads.
Both vulnerabilities, tracked as CVE-2021-30761 and CVE-2021-30762, reside in WebKit,
the browser engine used by Safari, and the component used by all iOS apps to load web
content.
Apple said it received reports from anonymous researchers that threat actors had exploited
the two bugs to run malicious code on usersâ€™ devices when the WebKit engine loaded and
processed maliciously crafted web content.
The Cupertino-based company released today iOS 12.5.4 to patch both issues.
The update is intended for old-gen devices such as the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus,
iPad Air, iPad mini 2, iPad mini 3, and iPod touch (6th generation), Apple said.
The two zero-days patched today mark the 8th and 9th actively-exploited zero-days patched
in Apple products this year. Previous zero-days included:
