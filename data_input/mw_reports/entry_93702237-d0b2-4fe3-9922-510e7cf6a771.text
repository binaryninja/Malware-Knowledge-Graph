Doctor Web researchers discovered that the official website of a well-known video
editing software, VSDC, was compromised. The hackers hijacked download links on
the website causing visitors to download a dangerous banking trojan, Win32.Bolik.2,
and the Trojan.PWS.Stealer (KPOT stealer) along with the editing software.
VSDC is a popular, free software for editing video and sound. According to SimilarWeb
statistics, monthly visits of the VSDC website come close to 1.3 million users. However, the
security measures taken by the website’s developers often turn out to be insufficient for such
traffic volume, which endangers a large number of people.

Last year unknown hackers gained access to the administrative side of the VSDC website
and replaced the download links. Instead of the editing software, users received a JavaScript
file, which then downloaded the AZORult Stealer, X-Key Keylogger and the DarkVNC
backdoor. The VSDC team stated that they closed the vulnerability, but recently we received
information about additional cases of infection through their website.
According to our researchers, the VSDC developer’s computer has been compromised
several times since the previous incident. One such hack led to the website being
compromised again between 2019-02-21 and 2019-03-23. This time hackers took a different
approach to spreading the malware: they embedded a malicious JavaScript code inside the
VSDC website. Its task was to determine the visitor’s geolocation and replace download links
for users from the UK, USA, Canada and Australia. Native website links were substituted by
links to another compromised website:
https://thedoctorwithin[.]com/video_editor_x64.exe
https://thedoctorwithin[.]com/video_editor_x32.exe
https://thedoctorwithin[.]com/video_converter.exe
Users that downloaded software from that website also received a dangerous banking trojan,
Win32.Bolik.2. Same as its predecessor, Win32.Bolik.1, this malware has qualities of a
multicomponent polymorphic file virus. Trojans of this family are designed to perform web
injections, traffic intercepts, key-logging and stealing information from different bank-client
systems. At the moment we have information on at least 565 cases of infection with this
trojan via videosoftdev.com site. It’s worth mentioning that so far only Dr.Web products
successfully detect all the trojan’s components.
Additionally, on 22.03.2019 the attackers changed the Win32.Bolik.2 trojan to another
malware, a variation of the Trojan.PWS.Stealer, KPOT Stealer. This trojan steals information
from browsers, Microsoft accounts, several messengers and some other programs. In just
one day it was downloaded by 83 users.

The VSDC developers were notified about the threat; and at the present moment, download
links were restored to the originals. However, Doctor Web experts recommend that all VSDC
users check their devices with our antivirus.
