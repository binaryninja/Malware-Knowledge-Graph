Over the past few weeks, an up-and-coming ransomware family that calls itself Avos Locker
has been ramping up attacks while making significant effort to disable endpoint security
products on the systems they target.

In a recent series of ransomware incidents involving this ransomware, Sophos Rapid
Response discovered that the attackers had booted their target computers into Safe Mode to
execute the ransomware, as the operators of the now-defunct Snatch, REvil, and
BlackMatter ransomware families had done in attacks we’ve documented here.
The reason for this is that many, if not most, endpoint security products do not run in Safe
Mode — a special diagnostic configuration in which Windows disables most third-party
drivers and software, and can render otherwise protected machines unsafe.

Not your grandfather’s ransomware
Avos in Portuguese translates to the word “grandfather” but this is no ransomware for old
men.
The Avos Locker attackers were not only rebooting the machines into Safe Mode for the final
stages of the attack; They also modified the Safe Mode boot configuration so they could
install and use the commercial IT management tool AnyDesk while the Windows computers
were still running in Safe Mode. Normally, third party software would be disabled on a
computer that had been rebooted into Safe Mode, but these attackers clearly intended to
continue to remotely access and control the targeted machines unimpeded.

Avos Locker deployment tools were stored in a backup server under a directory named a.
Attackers run the files remotely, so they’re never written to the filesystem of the targeted
machines.
It isn’t clear whether a machine that had been set up in this way – with AnyDesk set to run
under Safe Mode – would even be remotely manageable by its legitimate owner. The
operator of the machine might need to physically interact with the computer in order to
manage it.
In some instances we’ve also seen the attackers employ a tool called Chisel, which creates a
tunnel over HTTP, with the data encrypted using SSH, that the attackers can use as an
secure back channel to the infected machine.
There are also other indications that, in some of the attacks, there had been lateral
movement and other indicators of malicious behavior which were saved in the Event Logs of
some machines.

For example, this batch file was created on the same machine were it was run, just prior to
the attack.

And in this case, there’s an Event Log entry that shows a base64-encoded PowerShell script
being executed, with the results being output to a file called execute.bat, which is then run,
and finally deleted.

In another Event Log entry, there’s a record of a port being set up as a proxy on the targeted
machine, which would theoretically help the attackers conceal any lateral movement by
routing all commands through the proxy computer.

We’re also investigating the use by Avos of a Linux ransomware component that targets
VMware ESXi hypervisor servers by killing any virtual machines, then encrypting the VM
files. The above command was used to iterate and terminate any virtual machines that were
running on the hypervisor. It still isn’t clear how the attackers obtained the administrator’s
credentials needed to enable the ESX Shell or access the server itself.

Deploy like an IT pro
The attackers also appear to have leveraged another commercial IT management tool
known as PDQ Deploy to push out Windows batch scripts to machines they planned to
target. Sophos Rapid Response has created a chart that highlights the consequences of one
of these batch files running. The batch files are run before the computer is rebooted into Safe
Mode.

These batch scripts orchestrate stages of the attacks and lay the groundwork for the final
phase in which the threat actors deploy the Avos Locker ransomware. One of the batch
scripts we recovered was called Love.bat (shown above), which was pushed out to
machines on the network by the PDQDeployRunner service. We also saw batch files named
update.bat or lock.bat with small variations in them.
These orchestration scripts modified or deleted Registry keys that effectively sabotaged the
services or processes belonging to specific endpoint security tools, including the built-in
Windows Defender and third party software from companies such as Kaspersky, Carbon
Black, Trend Micro, Symantec, Bitdefender, and Cylance. The script disables Windows
Update and attempts to disable Sophos services, but the tamper protection feature prevents
the batch script from succeeding.
The attackers also used the batch script to create a new user account on the infected
machine (newadmin) and give it a password (password123456), and add it to the
Administrators user group. They then set the machine to automatically log in when it reboots
into Safe Mode. The attackers also disable certain registry keys used by some networks to
display a “legal notice” upon login. Disabling these features reduces the chance that the
automatic login will fail because a dialog box waiting for a human to click it is holding up the
process.

The Avos Locker batch script, recovered from a target’s network
The penultimate step in the infection process is the creation of a “RunOnce” key in the
Registry that executes the ransomware payload, filelessly, from where the attackers have
placed it on the Domain Controller. This is a similar behavior to what we’ve seen IcedID and

6/8

other ransomware do as a method of executing malware payloads without letting the files
ever touch the filesystem of the infected computer.

Avos Locker’s final set of commands before a reboot
The final step in the batch script is to set the machine to reboot in Safe Mode With
Networking, and to disable any warning messages or ignore failures on startup. Then the
script executes a command to reboot the box, and the infection is off to the races. If for
whatever reason the ransomware doesn’t run, the attacker can use AnyDesk to remotely
access the machine in question and try again manually.

Guidance and detection
Working in Safe Mode makes the job of protecting computers all the more difficult, because
Microsoft does not permit endpoint security tools to run in Safe Mode. That said, Sophos
products behaviorally detect the use of various Run and RunOnce Registry keys to do things
like reboot into Safe Mode or execute files after a reboot. We have been refining these
detections to reduce false positives, as there are many completely legitimate tools and
software which use these Registry keys for normal operations.
Ransomware, especially when it has been hand-delivered (as has been the case in these
Avos Locker instances), is a tricky problem to solve because one needs to deal not only with
the ransomware itself, but with any mechanisms the threat actors have set up as a back door
into the targeted network. No alert should be treated as “low priority” in these circumstances,
no matter how benign it might seem. The key message for IT security teams facing such an
attack is that even if the ransomware fails to run, until every trace of the attackers’
AnyDesk deployment is gone from every impacted machine, the targets will remain
vulnerable to repeated attempts. In these cases, where the Avos Locker attackers set up
access to their organization’s network using AnyDesk, the attackers can lock out the
defenders or run additional attacks at any time as long as the attackers’ remote access tools
remain installed and functional.
Various activities by the threat actors were detected (and blocked) by the behavioral
detection rules Exec_6a and Exec_15a. Intercept X telemetry showed that the CryptoGuard
protection mechanism was invoked when the ransomware attackers tried to run their
executable. Sophos products will also detect the presence of Chisel (PUA), PSExec (PUA),
and PSKill (PUA), but may not automatically block these files, depending on the local
policies set up by the Sophos admin.
