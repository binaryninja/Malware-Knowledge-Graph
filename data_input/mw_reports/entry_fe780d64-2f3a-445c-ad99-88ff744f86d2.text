The profile picture of Teng Snake on Twitter
As @CrazymanArmy and @ShadowChasing1 pointed out, our conclusion is also same
that there is no concrete evidence to connect Teng Snake with the previously known
APT-C-61.

1/22

Executive Summary
The “Teng Snake” team has created Telegram channels and group chats from October
2021. At the time, the team consisted of 4 core members and 7 sub-teams, and
systematically operated channels and group chats. They claimed that they were APT-C-61,
promoted provocatively, operated study teams, and recruited team members. However, there
is no clear evidence that they are related to APT-C-61.
(2022–02–10) Claimed to be APT-C-61 and started full-fledged activities.
(2022–03–19) Shared the information about a Korean website vulnerability and a list of
97 websites that may have the same vulnerability in one of the Teng Snake-managed
group chats.
(2022–04–07) Started selling PII(Personal Identifiable Information) and chemicals, and
receiving hacking requests.
(2022–05–02) A user named , who claimed to be team, uploaded a post on an
underground forum titled “South Korean health department invades” that was selling
AD server privileges from an association.
— The same post was uploaded to the newly opened Code Core Telegram channel on May
6 and Soaring Snake Twitter account on May 7 and 13.

2/22

(2022–05–20) Declared the suspension of for-profit activities and shut down Telegram
channels including several group chats except one channel.
— Mekimer started using CodecoreSET account on Telegram from this point.
(2022–06–17) Yashma-based has been discovered.

1. Abstract
The Teng Snake team first began opening channels and group chats in October 2021. By
June 2022, we have found 7 Telegram channels, 5 group chats, 6 accounts, and a Twitter
account Soaring Snake(@scan66322894) believed to be associated with Teng Snake. The
activities of the Teng Snake team from Telegram channels and group chats conversation are
listed in Figure 1.

2. Core members of Teng Snake
The ID of Telegram channels and group chats, which were directly managed by the Teng
Snake team, were composed in form of APT{2,3 digits}. The full list of Telegram channels
and group chats can be found in Appendix A.
The Teng Snake team revealed that the team had 4 core members and mentioned their roles
as shown below.

4/22

Figure 2. Core members of Teng Snake
We were able to find information about two of these members.

2.1. Mekimer: Head of Teng Snake
Mekimer is the leader and seems to be the keyman of the Teng Snake team. Most of the
critical information shared in all Teng Snake group chats is forwarding Mekimer’s messages.
The vulnerability information of the Korean website was also shared by forwarding a
Mekimer’s message.
We found 2 blogs that are believed to be managed by Mekimer, in which he listed some of
his personal information.

Figure 3. Two blogs of Mekimer
According to the information posted, he is a 21-year-old man and currently resides in
Cambodia.
At first, we assumed that Mekimer was living in China, but in the group chats, he steadily
appealed that he was abroad. It is difficult to confirm as there is no proof to back this up.
We also found that the nickname he used before working as alias Mekimer, anqusec.

5/22

Figure 4. Footer of Mekimer’s blog
By clicking on the word “回忆”, which means memories, at the bottom of Mekimer’s blog, it is
redirected to the anqusec blog. The blog posts also show that Mekimer continued to attack
websites in China and other overseas countries. Also, we found articles on how to use
hacking tools such as Nessus and AWVS, and articles on the use of 1-day vulnerabilities. In
particular, he had written articles about the website infiltration periodically, and we also found
that he infiltrated a Chinese coin exchange server using log4shell exploit.
After the Teng Snake team shut down some of their Telegram channels and group chats,
Mekimer started using the alias, CodecoreSET.

2.2. Activity history of anqusec in an underground forum
We found that Mekimer uploaded three posts on an underground forum using the alias
anqusec from November 13 to 15, 2021. We assumed that he also participated in the chat of
the forum. Mekimer introduced himself as Thunder Domain (or Xunlei domain name) team
in the following three posts.
(2021–11–13) Official Portal of Kerala Local Government Leaked
(2021–11–15) Fulbright plan | thunder field | 2021 | data operation
(2021–11–15) ICAT international technology center of India | Xunlei domain | 2021

Figure 5. Mekimer talked with ATW,

6/22

Mekimer appears to have provoked ATW (Against The West) last year, saying he knew his
identity. ATW responded they were still waiting for him to reveal his identity in one of the
posts published by Mekimer. Mekimer has not yet released ATW’s identity, and we assume
that Mekimer did not actually have ATW’s identity and just wanted to get attention or show
off.

2.3. Skull Killer : Pentester of Teng Snake
Skull Killer is responsible for website penetration, OSINT, and vulnerability discovery in the
Teng Snake team. In particular, Skull Killer is emphasized to have a large amount of personal
information, which can be seen from his previous Telegram channel and group chat.
Skull Killer operated one Telegram group chat and one channel. The group chat was opened
in August 2020, but it began operating in October 2021. Various personal information,
hacking tools, and vulnerabilities were shared in the group chat and their channels.
On January 29, 2022, a text file named “韩国_外汇_375224 份_3月.txt” was uploaded to a
chat room operated by Skull Killer. The file included 375,224 Korean account information,
and consisted of e-mail, name, phone number, job information, and hashed password.

3. Mekimer + Skull Killer + α
On February 10, 2022, Teng Snake shared a screenshot that contains directories and files
they used in the attack which was conducted in 2019, with the analysis report published by
360 Security about APT-C-61.
**APT-C-61(腾云蛇) report from 360 Security [link]
According to 360 Security, APT-C-61 group primarily targeted Pakistan and Bangladesh,
particularly important sectors such as government, military industry, and research centers.
APT-C-61 used spear-phishing and social engineering techniques to infiltrate, and DDE to
download malware. The malware that is finally installed on the host is an executable file
packaged with pyinstaller that executes commands received from the C&C server. Afterward,
utilities such as 7za.exe and rclone.exe were also downloaded to exfiltrate sensitive files.
Teng Snake group claimed to be APT-C-61 group, but the screenshot they uploaded
contained 2 python scripts, one suspected to be a tool. The tool has the same size (3kb) as
the publicly available script on Github. Also, a directory that was suspected to be an opensource tool called is also displayed.

Figure 6. Teng Snake claimed to be APT-C-61
Furthermore, while APT-C-61 used Google Drive and Dropbox, Teng Snake is using Ali
Cloud.

8/22

While the countries affected by APT-C-61 are located in South Asia, the countries identified
in Figure 7 and their tweets are South Korea, Myanmar, Turkey, and Taiwan. It’s an
overstatement to call them an APT group, as they are carrying out their attacks with very
obscure purposes.
As a result, when comparing the information of the APT-C-61 group with the information of
Teng Snake that has been released so far, it is hard to say that Teng Snake is an APT-C61 group.

4. Teng Snake started the emerging cyber threat in the real world.
4.1. Korean website vulnerability shared on a group chat
On March 19, 2022, a file named “韩国网贷.txt” was uploaded to a group chat along with
several files. The message was a forwarded Mekimer’s message by a user named 雷域 and
he is presumed to be the manager of the group chat.

Figure 8. Exploit payload of SQL injection
In the overall context, the file appears to be educational material for users in the group chat.
Hacking tools, hacking tips, a vulnerability, and a payload used to attack South Korean
websites were included in the file. It also included a list of websites that showed the
possibility of vulnerabilities or whether they existed.
The vulnerability was a SQL injection, and inside the file, there was an exploit payload that
could be used for actual attacks, as shown in the picture above.
In addition, as shown below, we were able to check the precautions and hacking tips to be
taken.
Use Nessus or AWVS 13.14 version instead of XRAY when scanning Korean websites
for vulnerabilities.
Use dynamic IP.
Look at the subdomains of the target website.
9/22

Many XSS vulnerabilities are found, but few are useful.
Social engineering, such as phishing mail, is much more useful to target administrators.
Finally, a list of 97 websites (one duplicated) that can test the forementioned vulnerabilities
was also shared, with more than half belonging to the financial and loan industry.

Figure 9. Classification results of shared URLs
After sending the message, the user continued to share hacking tools and vulnerabilities they
used, such as uDork and CANVAS, in the group chat and kept the group chats highly active.

4.2. Start selling PII, databases, and chemicals
At the end of March, Teng Snake closed some of their Telegram group chats and channels
and also stopped recruitment. At the time of recruiting, it is estimated that at least 100 people
were recruited in each of 3 group chats, so it seems that enough people gathered to stop
recruiting people and begin commercial activities.
On April 7, 2022, Teng Snake posted on their main channel that they started selling the
following chemicals and would not sell them to China.

10/22

Figure 10. Chemicals sold by Teng Snake
And on April 20, 2022, the Teng Snake team announced that they would start receiving
hacking requests and released their unit price list. The workable contents and unit price are
as follows.

11/22

Figure 11. Workable unit price released by Teng Snake
After they released their unit price, they continuously promoted that they were receiving
hacking requests on the Telegram channel. However, it seems that they were not paid even
after the finish of some requests.
In addition, they also sold Chinese personal information. Below is a part of the sales items.

12/22

Figure 12. Part of the Chinese PII selling list
After that, on May 2, the suspension of receiving hacking requests and data sales was
announced. Some buyers had raised suspicions about the resale of data sold by the Teng
Snake team, and some clients had not paid. This seems why they have declared a
shutdown.

Figure 13. Declared suspension of receiving hacking request and data sales

4.3. Selling AD server privilege of South Korea health department
On May 2, 2022, a user by the name of uteus posted on an underground forum titled “South
Korean Health Department Invades.” Pointing out he was part of a team called White
Dawn and sold access permission with captured photos of him accessing the AD server
believed to belong to the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Korea.
The Teng Snake team introduced themselves as White Dawn only in this post, and later
introduced themselves as Soaring Snake (or Snakes) team, as a part of the Code Core
team. Currently, Teng Snake’s Mekimer (a.k.a. CorecodeSET) and uteus are believed to be
in the Code Core team.

13/22

Figure 14. AD server privilege sales post by uteus,
As a result of analysis based on the username on the sample photo, it was confirmed that
the actual target of the attack was a different association. We presumed that they lack an
understanding of Korea.
In addition, supplementary profit-generating activities through the distribution of ransomware
were not being used at that time.

4.4. Who is uteus(uetus)?
uteus is currently one of the members of the Code Core team and is believed to be
responsible for planning attacks and recruiting team members. He has started activities on
the forum since April 15.

14/22

Figure 15. First post of uteus,
On April 15, 2022, when he began his activities, he posted about selling an iOS browser
RCE Zero Day and Twitter Token Zero Day. But he was criticized by other users for not
providing grounds for the vulnerabilities.
He also commented on the article titled “Отключаем Windows Defender (+ UAC Bypass,
+ Повышение до уровня SYSTEM)”, asking what passwords were for downloading tools
for Windows EoP.
cinder, mentioned in “South Korean health department invades,” is the alias he used on
another underground forum. He has started activities on the forum since April 3.

Figure 16. One of the posts by cinder,

15/22

On May 22, 2022, a post titled “Against-Killnet” was posted. He wrote to those who resisted
Killnet, commenting “Anonymous needs you,” and this suggests that he is related to
Anonymous.

4.5. Recruiting new team members and mentioning NATO
After announcing the suspension of receiving hacking requests and personal information
sales on the Telegram channel, Teng Snake began recruiting new team members on May 7.
The difference is that they started to check the hacking skills of the applicants.

Figure 17. Mentioned NATO on Telegram
The conditions for joining the Teng Snake team were stated that they should be experienced
(webshell upload, high-risk vulnerabilities, penetration of internal network nodes) in taking
control of the internal network of NATO allies.

Figure 18. Mentioned NATO on Twitter
On Twitter, they claimed that South Korea’s entry into NATO would cause a new war and that
they had already seized confidential data from the Ministry of National Defense. Korea
joining NATO mentioned here means that Korea has joined the NATO Cooperative Cyber
Defence Centre of Excellence as a regular member. Through this, it is speculated that Teng
Snake lacks understanding of this case and just ostensibly mentions it to create the
justification for attacks on NATO-related countries.

16/22

Figure 19. Continued to recruit new members
From this point on, May 17, they started receiving new team members who can steal server
privileges for non-governmental organizations, military, and third-party supply chains.

4.6. Code Core Ransomware Detected
On June 17, 2022, Code Core Ransomware was uploaded to Virus Total.
The ransomware was created by the Yashma ransomware builder (a.k.a. Chaos
ransomware builder), and the ransom note was customized to include their team name. For
information on the Chaos ransomware, refer to Appendix D. Based on the use of minor
Yashma ransomware builders rather than other famous RaaS, the Code Core team seems to
lack expertise in ransomware and the ransomware ecosystem.

Figure 20. Ransom note of Code Core Ransomware

Conclusion
Most of the attack methods used by the Teng Snake team have not been disclosed, but
it is estimated that they are mainly focused on cloud and web servers.

17/22

Currently, it has been confirmed that Mekimer, the team leader of Teng Snake, has
joined the Code Core team and is attacking South Korea and NATO countries along
with uteus and other team members.
The Code Core team is currently developing Yashma-based ransomware, so it is
expected to use the ransomware in future attacks.
Government agencies in NATO countries need to continuously monitor their activities.

The data was also sold on a collaboration channel, and it is still being sold on the
channel.
The collaboration channel was initially introduced as a channel managed by the Teng
Snake team, but from the end of March, it was introduced as an advertising channel. It
is presumed that the Teng Snake team is operating independently even after they
stopped working.
