Pique Analysis Report
20150911-280-CSIT-15085 Nflog

1.0 (U) Analysis Summary
(S//NF) The following report details a new variant of the NfLog Remote Access Tool (RAT),
also known as IsSpace, used by SAMURAI PANDA. This new variant is deployed using a
repurposed version of the leaked Hacking Team Adobe Flash Exploit which leverages CVE2015-5122. This new variant also incorporates the use of the Google App Engine (GAE) hosting
to proxy communications to its C2 Server.
(S//NF) NfLog is a basic RAT that polls C2 servers every 6 seconds awaiting an encoded
response. It uses an embedded plain text configuration file. The primary C2 server communicates
over port 80. Alternate ports are configurable through the secondary C2 server variable. This
RAT is also proxy aware. On older operating systems it will bind to port 1139 using a raw socket
and attempt to sniff proxy credentials. On newer systems with Windows Firewall it will attempt
to enumerate the basic authorization username and password used for most proxy authentications
using HTTP.
(S//NF) If NfLog determines that the current user has administrative privileges it will attempt to
reload itself using the elevated permissions. NfLog will use the well-known UAC bypass
technique of DLL side-loading of CryptBase.dll on Windows Vista and newer operating systems
to attempt UAC bypass and privilege escalation.
(S//NF) Persistence is achieved through the setting of an ASEP after the RAT has been installed
to a particular folder.
(S//NF) In conclusion, NfLog is a very simple RAT. No new techniques worthy of a PoC were
presented.

2.0 (U) Description of the Technique
(S//NF) No techniques are recommended for PoC development.

3.0 (U) Identification of Affected Applications
(U) Windows.

4.0 (U) Related Techniques
(S//NF) RAT and UAC Bypass.

5.0 (U) Configurable Parameters
(U) None.
