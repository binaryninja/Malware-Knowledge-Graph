Abstract
The Iranian-Israeli conflict has taken an accelerating dangerous turn. The pace and
momentum of the reciprocal cyber-attacks have accelerated from the two sides, since
the Stuxnet attack was first revealed in 2010. Analysts have come to use the term “cyber
war” without hesitation to describe the reciprocal cyber-attacks between Iran and
Israel.
This paper presented a realistic analysis of Stuxnet cyber-attack, aiming to uncover the
complexities associated with the launch decision-making process. It managed to answer
the question: Why were Stuxnet cyber-attack adopted, as a strategic choice for
managing the conflict instead of traditional choices? It also gave an understanding for
the security challenges and the strategic implications that cyber-attack had to pose.
Finally, it reached a number of conclusions to the effect that: Realism, as a theory
mostly concerned with issues of national security and power, can be a very suitable
theoretical framework for analyzing and understanding cyber-attacks. The analysis
confirmed that realism is an appropriate framework for identifying important issues
related to security in the cyberspace and can provide useful insights into some of the
enduring characteristics of international relations in the cyberspace.

A Realistic Analysis of the Stuxnet Cyber-attack

Cairo on 1st March 2022

By: Ahmad Mohee

Introduction:
In May 2011, the Pentagon announced an official list of cyber weapon capabilities
approved for use against adversaries. The list included a "toolkit" of methods to hack
foreign networks, examine and test their functionality and operations, and the ability to
leave "viruses" to facilitate future targeting1.
Several months before that, in July 2010, the Iranian-Israeli conflict seemed to have
taken a dangerous and accelerating turn, as the details of the cyber-attack on the
Iranian Natanz nuclear facility were revealed using a virus or a "malicious computer
worm" called Stuxnet2.
The attack revealed the possibility of causing massive physical destruction in industrial
facilities or vital infrastructure networks of any state without the need to mobilize
armies or move fleets.
The pace and momentum of reciprocal cyber-attacks accelerated between the two sides
since the Stuxnet attack was first revealed in 2010. Analysts have come to use the term
"cyber war" without hesitation to describe the reciprocal cyber-attacks between Iran
and Israel.
This was accompanied by a large cloud of controversy, mutual accusations, and theories
that sought to probe the depths of the new term emerged in the skies of political circles:
"cyber war".
This research paper aims to:





Answer the question: Why were cyber-attacks adopted in the case of the
Stuxnet, as a strategic option for conflict management instead of the traditional
options?
Apply the analysis of Realism to the case of Stuxnet, in order to understand the
security challenges and the strategic effects it poses.
Reach conclusions within the framework of Realism analysis.

Stuxnet Capabilities
Once announced, specialists had been engaged in Stuxnet analysis for several months,
to determine how it got into the control systems of the target industrial equipment,
which were offline by nature, the type of systems, equipment, processes targeted, the
entities that were attacked, and the functions the virus used to achieve the goals of the
attack.
The requirements for analyzing this cyber-attack in terms of the tools and expertise
used, the time required to reveal its capabilities and objectives, the estimation of the
resulting damage levels, and the appropriate defense strategies and procedures, were
completely different from the requirements for analyzing attacks in conventional wars.
The Stuxnet virus surreptitiously infiltrates and takes over industrial control systems
with the aim of sabotaging normal industrial operations. The malicious computer worm
is inserted via a "hole" in the industrial control system through a removable device such
as a USB memory stick3. The virus uses default Siemens passwords to access Windows
operating systems running WinCC and PC7 programs4.
According to Ralph Langner, Stuxnet contained two different digital warheads, which
were deployed together to present a "massive cyber strike against Iran's nuclear energy
program." The first cyber warhead worked against Siemens S7-315 controllers,
temporarily preventing legitimate software from taking control. The "Warhead" code
handled up to 186 high-speed engines by rotating operating speeds between low and
high values. The second cyber warhead, the Siemens 417 attack code, intercepted
physical I/O and "provided forensic software running on the console with the normal
input patterns pre-recorded by Stuxnet"5.
Langer likens the process to a form of gimmick usually depicted in Hollywood movies;
Surveillance during the robbery is replaced by pre-recorded security camera footage to
fool the authorities into believing that nothing is unfamiliar6.
If a nuclear centrifuge was indeed the target, the centrifuges needed to spin at a specific
speed for long periods of time in order to extract the uranium. Stopping this process at
high speeds could disrupt the sequestration of heavy isotopes in centrifuges. Tampering

with the motors in a gas centrifuge may lead to cracking and destruction of these
components7.

The target: Iran
Iran emerged as a potential target for the Stuxnet virus based on the geographical
extent of the infection, which suggested that Iran was the epicenter of the attacks, and
also on technical analyzes that revealed that Stuxnet could, at least in theory, “disable
or destroy” Iran’s centrifuges8.
Researchers have found out that the Stuxnet attack began in June 2009, and the time
frame between compiling the source code and launching the infection was only about
12 hours, indicating that “the attackers had immediate access to the computer they
used to spread the virus — either by working with an insider or inadvertently using a
knowledgeable person to introduce the infection”9.
The products of Siemens, the manufacturer of the target systems, were widely used in
Iran's power and communications plants, and in Iran’s first nuclear power plant near
Bushehr. It is possible that Stuxnet spread via contractors or over LANs to its expected
target, the Natanz reactor10.

Who Did It: Israel
Israel has been featured as the actor behind the Stuxnet attack in numerous media
reports11 12 13 14 15.

A Realistic Analysis of the Stuxnet Cyber-attack

Cairo on 1st March 2022

By: Ahmad Mohee

Although Israel hadn’t released any official comment over the Stuxnet cyber-attack, in
2010, it created the 8200 or SIGINT intelligence unit to pursue both offensive and
defensive duties of cyberwar. This confirmed that cyberwar was now one of the pillars
of Israel’s defense doctrine16 17.
Earlier in 2009, Scott Borg, an expert in the US-CCU, suggested that Israel might prefer a
cyber-attack on Iran's nuclear facilities rather than a military strike, a year before
Stuxnet was discovered18. In late 2010, Burg stated, "Israel certainly had the ability to
create Stuxnet…a tool like Stuxnet was the obvious weapon of Israel"19.

Who Did It: United States of America
There were also clear indications of US involvement and cooperation with Israel20 . It
was reported that United States - within the framework of one of its most secret
programs, initiated by the Bush administration and accelerated by the Obama’s - sought
to destroy Iran's nuclear program by new methods such as hacking Iranian computer
systems21.
United States was advised by an influential German think tank to target Iran's nuclear
capabilities through "covert sabotage". Volker Perthes, director of the German
government-funded Institute for Security and International Affairs, told US officials in
Berlin that covert operations would be "more effective than a military strike" in curbing
Iran's nuclear ambitions22.

A Realistic Analysis of the Stuxnet Cyber-attack

By: Ahmad Mohee

Cairo on 1st March 2022

In a New York Times article published in January 2009, an unspecified program was
credited with preventing an Israeli military attack on Iran, as some efforts focused on
ways to destabilize the centrifuges23.

Why Was A Cyber-attack Adopted As A Strategic Option To Manage The
Conflict Instead Of Traditional Options?
The US and Israeli governments intended to use Stuxnet as a tool to impede, or at least
delay, the Iranian nuclear program. The Bush and Obama administrations believed that
if Iran was on the verge of developing nuclear weapons, Israel would launch air strikes
against Iran's nuclear facilities in a move that could have triggered a regional war.
In early 2008, the Israeli government submitted a "secret" request to the Bush
administration to provide it with bunker-busting bombs capable of destroying
underground facilities; and refueling equipment to allow it to fly to Iran and back to
Israel, with permission to fly over Iraqi airspace. However, the Bush administration
"ignored" Israeli demands for bombs and refueling equipment and refused to use Iraqi
airspace, over fears that doing so would cause a "political uproar" in Iraq that might lead
to "the expulsion of American forces"24.
The Bush administration decided to pursue a new covert effort as a result of the failure
of sanctions to rein in Iran's uranium enrichment, and in light of the fact that options for
military strikes seemed "unacceptable". The Bush administration turned to the CIA to
help slow progress at Natanz and other "known and suspected nuclear facilities"25.
A dramatic meeting took place in the White House Situation Room late in the Bush
presidency, in which parts of a previously destroyed centrifuge were shown in an
experiment on the table. At that time, United States gave the green light to the
Operation Olympic Games, which included the Stuxnet cyber-attack26.
Operation Olympic Games was an extensive covert program to delay Iran's ability to
produce nuclear weapons broadly targeting "the entire industrial infrastructure that
supports Iran's nuclear program" including efforts to "destabilize" centrifuges. The
program also included "renewed US efforts to penetrate Iran's nuclear supply chain
abroad, along with new, some experimental efforts to undermine the electrical systems,
computer systems, and other networks that Iran relies on"27.

A Realistic Analysis of the Stuxnet Cyber-attack

Cairo on 1st March 2022

By: Ahmad Mohee

Prior to leaving office in 2009, the Bush administration allocated $300 million to such
secret joint projects with Israel against Iran28. The covert program appears to have been
"accelerated" under the Obama administration, although what that entails has been
shrouded in secrecy29.

Realistic Analysis of the Stuxnet Cyber-attack
Realism has always been a dominant paradigm in the field of international relations. The
field of cyber security shows a correlation with realist-influenced perspectives with a
focus on security and competition, power distribution, the advantage of attack over
defense, and the benefits of deterrence strategies. Although there is no theory of cyber
power in realist literature, realism provides a framework for understanding the
distribution of power among actors and how this relates to conflict30.
According to Reardon and Choucri: “Realist theories of deterrence, crisis management,
and conflict may be used to understand whether cyberspace is stabilizing or
destabilizing, whether cyber technologies will be a new source of conflict or of peace,
and whether states will engage in cyber arms racing.”31.

Conflict Management Options and The Realism of USA
The repercussions that led to the development and launch of Stuxnet within the
"Operation Olympic Games" refer to a realistic strategy on the American side for the
options of conflict with Iran. A cyber-attack was not Israel's first choice in dealing with
the threat of the Iranian nuclear program. Despite the strong alliance between United
States and Israel, and the mutual security dependence between them, especially with
regard to their interests in the Middle East, United States, within the framework of
realistic decision-making guidance, saw that Israel’s option to launch a conventional
military strike on the Iranian nuclear program could be of a huge cost for both US and
Israel.
And because the threat posed by the Iranian nuclear program was similar to both
American and Israeli national security, undermining Iran's nuclear capabilities was a
common strategic goal for the two states. However, United States sought with realism

and rationality to achieve its goals and self-interest to assert power and security in the
region by offering the most realistic, least costly strategic option for its national security
and the security of its ally, Israel.
The foregoing analysis could also be a reason why cyber warfare can sometimes not be
fully adopted as a strategic option in conflict. When the risks outweigh the benefits of
offensive action, states consider taking a more appropriate action, such as preparing the
future battlefield using conventional warfare options along with the limited use of cyber
warfare, given that the advantages of offensive actions in cyberspace have not yet
outweighed the risks32.

Cyberspace is an Anarchic System
James Adams views cyberspace as an anarchic system: “Cyberspace has become a new
international battlefield.” With no governing body or central authority, the Internet
perfectly fits a real-world security model. In this model, each state stands alone or with
its allies, whom it cannot fully trust, and is desperately trying to build up its cyber power
and defenses while fearing that every penetration made by another state poses a direct
threat to its security33.
In this context, the Stuxnet cyber-attack was a security nightmare because it proves that
any state is capable of attacking another state with impunity and without leaving any
trace of the origin of the attack. Also, the neorealist theory predicts that there will be a
complete breakdown of trust and of international institutions. As each state will fear
imminent and unknown attacks, and consequently will retreat and build its own
strength.
The lack of a hierarchical structure and overarching authority in cyberspace made many
of the steps taken to hack and sabotage the centrifuges in Natanz possible. Cyberspace,
as another arena in which states present their interests, and in which interests converge
and collide, undoubtedly becomes an extension of the system intended by Waltz in his
realistic analysis.

Balance of Power Analysis
Due to the relatively low cost of entering the field of cyber warfare, traditionally weaker
states can challenge stronger states and redistribute powers in the system34. One of the
most important direct results of the Stuxnet attack was the increasing sophistication of

Iranian cyber warfare capabilities and tactics35. Iran now possesses defense, deterrence
and even cyber-attack tools that enabled it to target US and Israeli facilities and
infrastructure networks. The reciprocal cyber-attacks between the two sides escalated
after the Stuxnet attack, until analysts started calling it “cyber war” without hesitation.
Lindsay argues that only states with great technological powers have the ability to
develop the most advanced cyber weapons suggesting that the asymmetric nature of
the cyber domain may be overstated36. This may be reflected in the fact that Israel could
not have developed Stuxnet alone without the help, financing and facilities of United
States.
Stuxnet attack did not succeed in destroying all the centrifuges at the Natanz reactor.
But if the goals were to bring a disruption or a delay to the Iranians' progress in uranium
enrichment, it appears that Stuxnet was successful in achieving those realistic goals37.

Conclusions
Realism, as a theory mostly concerned with issues of national security and power in
international relations, is a very suitable theoretical framework for analyzing and
understanding cyber-attacks. This analysis confirmed that realism is an appropriate
framework for analyzing important issues related to security in cyberspace, and can
provide useful insights into some of the enduring characteristics of international
relations in cyberspace.
A realistic analysis of the Stuxnet cyber-attack was able to give us the following
explanations:
1- The fact that United States and Israel joined forces to launch a powerful cyberattack that could disrupt uranium enrichment at Iran's Natanz reactor. This
cyber-attack was an attempt to maintain the relative power of two states over a
third.
2- Cyberspace is a reflection of the anarchic international system in its structure,
and therefore states are intertwined with interests forced to seek their own
security. This was expressed as a direct action on the initiative of the two allies,
United States and Israel, in the search for security and the realization of their
interests using cyber force.

3- The adoption of cyber-attack as a strategic option to maintain relative strength
showed that cyber capabilities are an influential factor in the distribution of
powers and capabilities in international relations. It can affect the relative power
between states and ensure the survival of states in the international system.
4- The lack of a hierarchical structure and comprehensive authority in cyberspace,
tempting governmental and non-governmental entities to use cyber-attacks to
achieve their goals and interests.
5- Cyber-attacks are “unconventional weapons” that can ensure some balance to
the anarchic international system, as no state can always be safe from cyberattacks.
6- It is very difficult to track cyber-attacks in most of the cases, as the attackers can
leave no trace or leave false evidence to implicate others.
