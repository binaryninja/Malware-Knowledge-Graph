Chairman ABRAHAM. Good morning. The Subcommittee on Oversight and Research and Technology will come to order.
Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare recess of the
Subcommittee at any time.
This hearing will be entitled ‘‘Scholars or Spies: Foreign Plots
Targeting America’s Research and Development.’’ I’m going to recognize myself for five minutes for an opening statement.
Again, good morning. Welcome to the joint Oversight and Research and Technology hearing ‘‘Scholars or Spies: Foreign Plots
Targeting America’s Research and Development.’’ This hearing is
an opportunity to address the vulnerability of U.S. academic institutions to the threat of foreign exfiltration of valuable science and
technology research and development.
Exfiltration is a new word being used to describe the surreptitious removal of data, as well as R&D, both of which we’ll discuss
today. We look forward to hearing from former government and
private sector experts about the magnitude and consequences of
this threat. We are also interested in learning what actions must
be taken to prevent or mitigate this threat in the future without
stifling the collaborative research activities that are critical to the
United States academic sector.
Over the past few years, case after case has been reported at our
universities and colleges, all with similar themes. After obtaining
access to data and other valuable information, individuals, including professors, students, researchers and visitors—some with
strong ties to a foreign nation—attempt to take that knowledge to
foreign governments, universities, or companies.
As a medical doctor myself, I found one case particularly concerning. A former associate professor at New York University, specializing in MRI technology, had been working on research sponsored by a grant from the National Institutes of Health. According
to prosecutors in the initial charges, this individual colluded with
representatives from a Chinese-sponsored research institute and
concealed the fact that he patented technology developed with NIH
funds for the purpose of licensing it to a Chinese medical imaging
company for literally millions of dollars.
This case and others demonstrate the targeting of the innovation
and intellectual property from our country’s greatest minds and institutions and, in some cases, the ability for foreign nations to gain
easy access by exploiting the lax security posture of our academic
institutions.
The Science Committee has continuously engaged in vigorous
oversight of federally funded basic research and technology, particularly research with a clear path to commercialization and a direct benefit for U.S. businesses and government. A significant
amount of academic research and development is funded by the
American taxpayers. Just last year, the Federal Government spent
approximately $1.5 billion on research and development, in addition to the even larger amount of funding provided by private sector U.S. companies and universities.
If this nefarious activity is aimed at recipients of federal grant
programs, then it is the American taxpayers that are unwittingly
funding the technological advancements and innovative break-

6
throughs that allow foreign nations to improperly gain a competitive economic advantage.
China has publicly proven itself to be the most aggressive in the
targeting of U.S. research over the past decade. China has heavily
invested increasing amounts of financial and physical resources to
support a science and technology industry that is based on the
transfer of basic science, which allows that country to prioritize advanced development and commercialization over basic and fundamental research. Essentially, China steals our fundamental research and quickly capitalizes by commercializing the technology.
While much of the discussion and examples used in today’s hearing may focus on China, I want to be clear that this committee is
very concerned about all foreign nations and agents that are inappropriately attempting to take advantage of America’s research and
development. China’s efforts in particular have provided useful examples to analyze, mainly because of their open and aggressive tactics. However, the recent DOJ charges based on Iran’s actions are
further confirmation that this problem is not confined just to
China, and we should assume a number of other bad actors are
also making similar attempts.
Taking that into account, bolstering the cybersecurity of federal
information systems has been among the Committee’s top priorities. I am hopeful that the discussion here today will highlight efforts to accomplish this objective and make prevention a priority of
all recipients of taxpayer dollars. Whether physical or cybersecurity
threats, it is clear that our academic institutions are not taking all
the necessary steps to adequately protect this vital research.
I look forward to the insight of our witnesses today, which will
help us assess these important issues and determine whether additional questions need to be asked of our partners in the executive
branch, as well as in academia. We hope to better understand the
next steps that must be taken to safeguard the competitiveness
and security of federally funded research and development, especially the role of U.S. academic institutes.

Chairman ABRAHAM. I now recognize the Ranking Member of the
Oversight Committee, the gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Beyer, for
an opening statement.
Mr. BEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’d like to thank you and
Chairwoman Comstock for holding this hearing.
Vigilance against espionage threats is important on all fronts
from cybersecurity breaches to intelligence gathering by covert
operatives on the ground.
As a committee, we’ve conducted numerous bipartisan investigations into cyber breaches. Our June hearing on WannaCry, for instance, gave us context into the recent Iranian attacks on hundreds
of domestic and foreign universities. Hacking, however, is but one
tool in a suite of techniques used by intelligence agencies to target
U.S. universities.
In cases of academic-related espionage, student researchers are
recruited by a foreign government to study or do research at an
American institution and pass along sensitive scientific research
and technology to the foreign government. American universities
play a critical role in driving fundamental research and developing
innovative technologies for our nation. The loss of this sort of data
can have tremendous economic consequences, endanger our national security, and diminish our technological lead in critical technologies.
Although an essential tenet of academia is this open pursuit of
scientific research professors, students, university scientists need to
understand the potential value of their research to foreign adversaries. They should be properly educated about potential espionage
threats and trained on how to take appropriate security measures,
whether they’re online or at an international conference presenting
their research findings.
What I do not believe what we want to do, however, is pull the
welcome mat from under the more than 1 million foreign students
to come to America to study every year, contributing more than $36
billion to our economy annually, and creating hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs and contributing to America’s academic leadership. And having just finished paying for the third college education, I’m so grateful for the full tuitions that foreign students
pay, holding down at least a little bit the price that we have to pay.
The media has recently painted a poor picture of the academic
community being disinterested or naive about the potential security threats they face. I’m not sure this is an accurate portrait. The
higher education community has several vehicles they use to identify threats and train their members to take actions to mitigate
their vulnerabilities to attack. These include the Research and
Education Network, Information Sharing and Analysis Center, the
Higher Education Information Security Council, and the newly
formed Omni Security Operations Center described as, quote, ‘‘a
pioneering initiative that helps higher education institutions reduce the impact of cybersecurity threats.’’ The new group that’s
based in Indiana University includes collaboration with Northwestern University, Purdue University, Rutgers, and the University of Nebraska Lincoln.
Cooperation in the security arena is critical, and I’m glad to see
this sort of cooperation emerging between universities. However,

10
these universities also need the cooperation from the law enforcement and the intelligence community to help ensure that they’re
apprised of specific threats or risks.
In 2005, to help foster better lines of communication between the
FBI and the U.S. academic community, the FBI created the National Security Higher Education Advisory Board originally composed of 15 Presidents and Chancellors of leading universities. But,
unfortunately, this past February, the members of this board received a letter from the FBI announcing their decision to disband
it. The letter praised the cooperation between intelligence agencies,
law enforcement, and academia and said the FBI was exploring the
creation of a new board. Officials in the academic community, however, believe the board played an important role in helping universities understand the intelligent risks they face and were both surprised and disappointed this board was disbanded with no clear
plan to replace it.
So, Mr. Chairman, I’m attaching this letter to my statement, as
well as a letter from the Association of American Universities, the
Association of Public and Land Grant Universities, the American
Council on Education, and the Council on Governmental Relations
all regarding this important issue.
Chairman ABRAHAM. Without objection.
Mr. BEYER. Thank you.
[The information appears in Appendix II]
Mr. BEYER. Balancing legitimate security risks with international scientific cooperation is critical to ensure that we address
real risks appropriately and thoroughly while not diminishing the
benefits we have obtained by opening our doors to foreign students
and collaborating with international partners. We don’t stop using
computers because they’re vulnerable; we take steps to make them
safer. Likewise, we cannot let concern over academic espionage
crowd out the multitude of benefits from the international exchange of scholarship.
America’s leadership in science and technology is highly dependent upon its openness to scholars from around the globe. Any action we take to respond to the threat of academic espionage must
take into account the value of cooperation. The intelligence community and the academic community should not be at odds but rather
working together to secure our sensitive research.
So I’m looking forward to hearing from our witnesses today about
how we can balance these two important issues regarding security
and scholarship. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.

OPENING STATEMENT
Ranking Member DonaldS. Beyer (D-VA)
of the Subcommittee on Oversight
House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology
Subcommittee on Oversight
Subcommittee on Research and Technology
"Scholars or Spies: Foreign Plots Targeting America's Research and Development"
Aprill1,2018
Thank you, Chairman Abraham and Chairwoman Comstock.
First, I would like to take a moment before digging into the topic of academic espionage to again
implore this Committee to take action on Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
Administrator Scott Pruitt. Administrator Pruitt's unethical behavior, wasteful use of taxpayer
money, and his ongoing efforts to undermine the EPA's mission of protecting our environment
and public health warrant some serious congressional oversight. I have previously requested that
Chairman Smith bring Administrator Pruitt before the Science Committee to testify, as is
standard practice and now, amidst various scandals, this is more crucial than ever.
Administrator Pruitt's predecessor, Gina McCarthy, testified before this Committee on three
occasions during the second term of the Obama Administration, testifying first just four months
after her confirmation. By comparison, Administrator Pruitt was confitmed 14 months ago, but
has yet to appear before the Committee. Pruitt cannot be allowed to continue to sell our nation's
clean air and water to special interests without consequences- if the President refuses to hold
him accountable Congress must do its job and conduct meaningful oversight.
Turning back to the topic of the day: vigilance against espionage threats is important on all
fronts, from cybersecurity breaches to intelligence gathering by covert operatives on the ground.
As a committee, we have conducted numerous bipartisan investigations into cyber breaches.
Hacking, however, is but one tool used by intelligence agencies to target U.S. universities. In
cases of academic-related espionage, a student or researcher is recruited by a foreign goverruncnt
to study or do research at an American institution and passes along sensitive scientific research
or technology to the foreign goverrunent. American universities play a critical role in driving
fundamental research and developing innovative technologies for our nation. The loss of this sort
of data can have tremendous economic consequences, endanger our national security, and
diminish our technological lead in critical technologies.
Although an essential tenet of academia is its open pursuit of scientific research, professors,
students and university scientists need to understand the potential value of their research to
foreign adversaries. They should be properly educated about potential espionage threats and
trained on how to take appropriate security measures whether they are online or at an
international conference presenting their research findings. What I do not believe we want to do,
however, is pull the welcome mat out from under the more than one million foreign students who
come to America to study every year, contributing more than $36 billion to our economy
annually, creating hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs, and contributing to America's academic

12
leadership. In fact, immigrants to America have won 81 Nobel Prizes in Chemistry, Medicine,
and Physics between 1960 and 2017.
The media has recently painted a poor pictnre of the academic community being disinterested or
naive about the potential security threats they face. 1 am not sure that is an accurate portrait. The
higher education community has several vehicles they use to identify threats and train their
members to take actions to mitigate their vulnerabilities to attack. These include the Research
and Education Networking Information Sharing and Analysis Center (REN-ISAC), the Higher
Education Information Security Council (HEISC), and the newly formed Omni Security
Operations Center (OmniSOC), described as a "pioneering initiative that helps higher education
institutions reduce the impact of cybersecurity threats." The new group is based at Indiana
University and includes collaboration with Northwestern University, Purdue University, Rutgers
University and the University ofNebraska-Lincoln.
Cooperation in the security arena is critical, so I am glad to sec this. However, universities also
need cooperation from the law enforcement and intelligence community to help ensure they are
apprised of specific threats or tisks.
In 2005, to help foster better lines of communication between the FBI and the U.S. academic
community, the FBI created the National Security Higher Education Advisory Board
(NSHEAB), originally composed of 15 Presidents and Chancellors of leading U.S. universities,
including Carnegie Mellon, Johns Hopkins, UCLA and MIT. Unfortunately, this past February,
the Members of this board received a letter from the FBI announcing their decision to disband it.
The letter praised the cooperation between intelligence agencies, law enforcement and academia,
and said the FBI was exploring the creation of a new board. Officials in the academic
community, however, believe the board played an important role in helping universities
understand the intelligence risk they faced, and were both surprised and disappointed it was
disbanded without a plan in place for its replacement.
I am attaching this letter to my statement, as well as a letter from the Association of American
Universities (AAU), Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU), American
Council on Education (ACE), and the Council on Governmental Relations (COGR) regarding
this important issue.
Ultimately, we cannot let concern over academic espionage crowd out the multitude of benefits
trom the international exchange of scholarship. Balancing legitimate security risks with
intemational scientific cooperation is critical, as America's leadership in science and technology
is highly dependent upon its openness to scholars fi·om around the globe. Any action we take to
respond to the threat of academic espionage must take into account the value of cooperation
between the intelligence community and the academic community, who must work together to
secure our sensitive research.
I look fotWard to hearing from today's witnesses about how we can balance these two important
issues regarding security and scholarship.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.

Chairman ABRAHAM. Thank you. And I now recognize the Chairman of the full committee, the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Lamar
Smith.
Chairman SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Also, I want to
thank Chairwoman Comstock for letting me jump in ahead of her.
I have a bill before the Judiciary Committee this morning that’s
being marked up, so I’m going to need to excuse myself shortly, but
I will be back to ask questions.
Mr. Chairman, foreign countries’ attempts to access and steal
U.S. research and development pose an acute risk to our national
and economic security. In recent months, the public has become
aware that we are under attack from foreign governments that
want to steal our technological secrets and scientific discoveries
and use them for their own purposes.
Just last month, the U.S. Department of Justice showed how serious the threat is. DOJ indicted nine Iranian nationals for breaking into university computer systems and stealing information and
intellectual property worth billions of dollars. This brazen theft
was on behalf of the Iranian government and universities in Iran.
This was a widespread and concentrated campaign. Attackers
hacked nearly 4,000 accounts of professors across 144 U.S. universities. According to informed sources, the attackers specifically targeted universities engaged in science, technology, and medical research.
According to the Justice Department, U.S. universities spent
more than $3.4 billion on creating and developing the scientific information, academic data, and intellectual property that was stolen. Nearly $3.5 billion of U.S. research, some of which was funded
by American taxpayers, was illegally taken and is now in the
hands of a hostile foreign nation. This is just one example.
Unfortunately, Iran is not the only threat. China has actively
and aggressively targeted research and development at U.S. academic institutions for years. The Chinese Government has been
very clear about its long-range plans for achieving global domination in critical areas of science and technology. China, however, has
been less than forthright about its methods, which include theft of
confidential information and technological secrets from U.S. companies, cyber attacks, and other forms of spying to undermine our national security and putting sleeper agents at our own research universities to steal our scientific breakthroughs.
Chinese efforts are concentrated in the areas that it has
prioritized: artificial intelligence, medical science, and national security. By understanding China’s priorities and the lengths to
which it is prepared to go, we can adopt an effective approach, but
the first step is recognizing the risks we face.
The intelligence community has warned about these threats for
years, ranging from cyber attacks to human manipulation to breakins. We know that foreign agents routinely target American students and educators in their priority areas. Faculty and administrators must be alert and educated to spot the warning signs of foreign operations. But many in academia have been unwilling to accept reality and unwilling to take any defensive measures to protect their researchers’ work, their universities’ scientific assets, and
taxpayers’ investments.

14
The University of Texas recently rejected funding from the
China-United States Exchange Foundation, a China-based and government-connected foundation. The foundation is registered as a
foreign agent representing China. The idea of a university taking
significant funding from an organization controlled by a foreign
government would be contrary to the independence and safeguards
needed in academia. This action by the University of Texas was appropriate and the type of proactive oversight that needs to occur at
other colleges.
The National Science Foundation’s grant guidance is clear: As
grant recipients, universities bear full responsibility for the management and results of federally funded projects. The recent indictments of Iranian student-spies and other incidents are clear warnings about the need for swift, strong action. This includes improved
cybersecurity, educating researchers to anticipate attempts to steal
their work, and more careful screening of those who come to the
United States to study.
I also look forward to hearing from our experts about how we can
build appropriate defenses. On the one hand, we must maintain
the open and collaborative nature of academic research and development. On the other, we must protect our research and development from actors who seek to do us harm.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.

Statement by Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas)
Scholars or Spies: Foreign Plots Targeting America's Research and Development
Chairman Smith: Foreign countries' attempts to access and steal U.S. research and

development pose an acute risk to our national and economic security. In recent
months, the public has become aware that we are under attack from foreign
governments that want to steal our technological secrets and scientific discoveries and
use them for their own purposes.
Just last month, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) showed how serious the threat is.
DOJ indicted nine Iranian nationals for breaking into university computer systems and
stealing information and intellectual property worth billions of dollars. This brazen theft
was on behalf of the Iranian government and universities in Iran.
This was a widespread and concentrated campaign. Attackers hacked nearly 4,000
accounts of professors across 144 U.S. universities. According to informed sources. the
attackers specifically targeted universities engaged in science, technology and
medical research.
According to the Justice Department. U.S. universities spent more than $3.4 billion on
creating and developing the scientific information, academic data and intellectual
property that was stolen. Nearly $3.5 billion of U.S. research- some of which was funded
by American taxpayers -was illegally taken and is now in the hands of a hostile foreign
nation. This is just one example.
Unfortunately, Iran is not the only threat. China has actively and aggressively targeted
research and development (R&D) at U.S. academic institutions for years.
The Chinese government has been very clear about its long range plans for achieving
global domination in critical areas of science and technology. China, however, has
been less forthright about its methods, which include theft of confidential information
and technological secrets from U.S. companies, cyber-attacks and other forms of
spying to undermine our national security and putting sleeper agents at our research
universities to steal our scientific breakthroughs.
Chinese efforts are concentrated in the areas that it has prioritized: artificial intelligence,
medical science and national security.

16
By understanding China's priorities and the lengths to which it is prepared to go, we can
adopt an effective approach. But the first step is recognizing the risks we face.
The intelligence community has warned about these threats for years. ranging from
cyber-attacks to hurnan manipulation to break-ins. We know that foreign agents
routinely target American students and educators in their priority areas. Faculty and
administrators must be alert and educated to spot the warning signs of foreign
operations.
But many in academia have been unwilling to accept reality and unwilling to take any
defensive measures to protect their researchers' work. their universities' scientific assets
and taxpayers' investments.
The University of Texas recently rejected funding from the China-United States Exchange
Foundation, a China-based and government-connected foundation. The foundation is
registered as a foreign agent representing China. The idea of a university taking
significant funding from an organization controlled by a foreign government would be
contrary to the independence and safeguards needed in academia. This action by the
University of Texas was appropriate and the type of proactive oversight that needs to
occur at other colleges.
The National Science Foundation's grant guidance is clear- as grant recipients,
universities bear full responsibility for the management and results of federally funded
projects. The recent indictments of Iranian student-spies and other incidents are clear
warnings about the need for swift, strong action. This includes improved cybersecurity,
educating researchers to anticipate attempts to steal their work and more careful
screening of those who come to the U.S. to study.
I also look forward to hearing from our experts about how we can build appropriate
defenses. On the one hand, we must maintain the open and collaborative nature of
academic research and development. On the other. we must protect our research and
development from actors who seek to do us harm.

Chairman ABRAHAM. Thank you. I now recognize the Ranking
Member of the full committee, Ms. Johnson, for an opening statement.
Ms. JOHNSON. Thank you very much, Chairman Abraham and
Chairwoman Comstock, for convening this hearing today, and
thanks to the panel that agreed to appear before us.
America’s superior academic institutions have drawn the best
and the brightest from around the world, and we have benefited
greatly from their contributions. From 1960 to 2017, foreign immigrants who settled in America won 81 Nobel Prizes in chemistry,
medicine, and physics. In 2016, all six Americans who won Nobel
Prizes in chemistry, physics, and economics were immigrants.
Many of these immigrants came here as international students.
Academic and intellectual openness are key to the success of
American higher education and America’s leadership in science and
technology. However, we do face legitimate and serious threats
from foreign adversaries. They are targeting our scientific innovations and advanced technologies whether at our government-funded
laboratories, in our industries, or on the campuses of our universities. The theft of—plunder of our critical technologies must be
clearly addressed and prevented.
Our counterintelligence community must work hand-in-hand
with research institutions to help mitigate the risk of these threats.
These institutions need to be engaged in applying best practices in
their approach to security and know how to identify acts of espionage. Professors and researchers should learn more about intelligence activities carried out through social engineering, networking, and conference participation. Now is not the time for the
counterintelligence community to reduce its outreach to research
colleges and universities. These bonds should be growing and
strengthening. It is vital to our national security.
However, we need to be careful that any security measures do
not stifle the benefits our country realizes from legitimate international academic collaboration. At the same time, we should also
examine the reasons why universities find international students
so attractive. Part of the reason is economic. Nationwide, States
have reduced levels of financial support to our respective public institutions of higher learning. Universities have responded by cutting financial aid and raising tuition fees. International students
who usually pay full tuition have helped make up this reduction in
funding and have helped universities balance their books.
This also makes the allure for foreign funding from students of
foreign institutions such as China’s Confucius Institute that offer
hundreds of thousands and occasionally millions of dollars for academic programming very enticing. We need to make sure that state
and federal support for higher education meets the needs of these
vital institutions. It is vital to our national security.
I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today, and I yield
back the balance of my time.

Subcommittee on Research and Technology
"Scholars or Spies: Foreign Plots Targeting America's Research and Development"
April!!, 2018
Thank you Chairman Abraham and Chairwoman Comstock for convening this hearing today.
Thank you to our panel of witnesses for joining us this morning.
America's superior academic institutions have drawn the best and the brightest from around the
world, and we have benefitted greatly from their contributions. From 1960 to 2017, foreign
immigrants who settled in America won 81 Nobel Prizes in Chemistry, Medicine and Physics
and in 2016, all six Americans who won Nobel Prizes in Chemistry, Physics and Economics

Chairman ABRAHAM. Thank you, Ms. Johnson.
I now recognize the Chair of the Research and Technology Subcommittee, Mrs. Comstock, for an opening statement.
Mrs. COMSTOCK. Thank you, Chairman Abraham, for holding a
hearing on this important and serious issue. It would be easy to
think about the theft of information from American universities by
foreign students to be the topic of a modern-day spy novel, but in
fact it is a very real problem and, sadly, not a new one. My predecessor in the House, Representative Frank Wolf, also worked on
this important issue.
Academic institutions in the United States are valued for their
openness, innovation, and collaboration with domestic and international scientists. Our nation has long been a leader in science
and technology research and development, and consequently, a
magnet for foreign scholars and scientists seeking to learn from
and collaborate with the best.
Unfortunately, various immoral actors have sought to exploit our
openness to steal American ingenuity and innovation and undermine our system. Such thefts can enable foreign nations to save
themselves billions in research and development costs and support
technological advances that they may otherwise be unable to make
on their own in order to gain an industrial or, even more troubling,
a military advantage.
The FBI has been warning our academic community about these
threats for years, while also urging measures be taken to guard
against such activity. Since much of the stolen information comes
from research funded by federal agencies, these nations are ultimately stealing ideas and innovations from American taxpayers
like you and me, undermining the policy intent of federal funding
for such research in the first place. It is imperative that our academic institutions not close their eyes to the very real threat posed
by foreign intelligence spies. They cannot be blinded by naivete or
ignorance when distinguishing between friend and foe.
But to be clear, the solution is not to shutter the doors of American universities and colleges to students, researchers, and professors from foreign nations. The vast majority of scholars who come
to the United States do so to work with our citizens on scientific
discoveries and breakthroughs based on an open exchange of ideas
to benefit the scientific community and the world.
Finding an appropriate balance between scientific openness and
security concerns is not new, nor is it easy, but it’s essential. As
our world continues to be increasingly connected electronically,
with more devices that can be used to covertly take pictures or
scans, it is getting easier for foreign criminals to steal our information. Other committees just today are talking to major players on
that front, as we know. That is why hearings like this are important, as they shine a light on the problem and provide a venue to
engage with stakeholders to identify potential solutions.
I look forward to hearing what our witnesses have to say and
hope they have some advice on how to better distinguish between
scholar and spy so that we may find the balance between open scientific collaboration and protecting America’s research and development.

21
As I mentioned, we do have some headline-grabbers here today,
as you might know in the Capitol, but I think this issue is every
bit as important, and I thank the witnesses for being here today.
And I yield back.

TESTIMONY OF THE HONORABLE MICHAEL WESSEL,
COMMISSIONER, U.S.-CHINA ECONOMIC
AND SECURITY REVIEW COMMISSION

Mr. WESSEL. Thank you, Chairs Abraham, Comstock, and Smith,
Ranking Members Beyer, Lipinski, and Johnson. It’s great to be
here before the committee, and it’s an honor to appear before you.
My name is Michael Wessel, and I’m a Commissioner on the
U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission. While appearing before you in my capacity as a Commissioner, the views I
express are my own, although of course my views are informed by
the work I and my colleagues do.
This hearing is particularly timely in light of the President’s actions to confront China’s policies in the intellectual property arena.
China has stolen, coerced, and subsidized the massive transfer of

25
intellectual property to their country from the United States. These
efforts have advanced their economic and military power.
Clearly, not everything is a zero-sum game. Advancements in
science, medicine, technology, and innovation can improve the lives
of all people around the globe, but China is not as interested in advancing global interests as much as their own.
China has made their priorities public. Most important for this
hearing is China’s Made in China 2025 Initiative, which identified
10 key sectors the government would support to be global leaders
in, which have significant economic and national security implications. They range from new energy vehicles to biotech, robotics,
next-generation information technology, and high-tech ships. China
is using an all-of-government approach to stakeout dominant positions in the global market in these technologies with the commitment of hundreds of billions of dollars. China will do whatever it
takes legally or illegally to achieve its goals.
My colleagues will talk about many of the illegal means. I will
focus on some of China’s key public programs and their targeting.
Perhaps the most well-known program is the propagation and
funding of Confucius Institutes all over the globe with roughly 100
here in the United States, as was noted earlier. They are purported
to teach Chinese language, culture, and history. As Politico noted
earlier this year, the Confucius Institutes’ goals are little less
wholesome and edifying than they sound, and this by the Chinese
Government’s own account.
China is willing to influence the current and future generations
of American leaders, their views, and their research. Last week,
Texas A&M terminated its Confucius Institute after Congressman
McCaul and Cuellar wrote that, quote, ‘‘These organizations are a
threat to our nation’s security by serving as a platform for China’s
intelligence collection and political agenda.’’
Another significant program is known as Project 111. Under that
program was the Thousand Talents program, which is designed to
recruit foreign experts in strategic sectors from the world’s top universities to come to China to assist in achieving their goals. The
target is now 4,000 participants. Participants receive extensive
benefits, including a bonus payment of roughly $158,000, in addition to salaries based on previous levels.
The FBI’s Counterintelligence Strategic Partnership has warned
that these programs pose a threat to our nation’s academic community. And I quote, ‘‘Chinese talent programs pose a serious threat
to U.S. businesses and universities through economic espionage
and theft of intellectual property.’’ The different programs focus on
specific fields deemed critical to China to boost China’s national capability in S&T fields.
The size of the foreign student population of the United States
is significant and raises interest—issues that merit attention. Of
the more than 1 million international students studying here,
China accounted for 32.5 percent of the total or roughly 350,000.
Chinese students have a significant presence on many campuses
and in many labs where critical research is being done. Many of
these labs receive significant federal funding from the Department
of Defense or the National Science Foundation. At the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Lab, roughly 20 percent of the Ph.D.

26
students are PRC nationals. At the University of Maryland’s Bing
Nano Research Group, 30 of the 38 postdoctoral researchers and
graduate students are from China. Every one of the visiting researchers and professors utilizing J visas are from China. The lab
receives support from 15 different federal agencies, including
NASA, DARPA, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, and the
Department of Energy.
Bilateral scientific cooperation programs also bear attention as
there are questions about the real value of some of those programs
to us. Sunlight is a great disinfectant, and today’s hearing is an important step in that process. Raising awareness to the potential
risks associated with China’s academic activities vis-a-vis U.S. interests is key. In my prepared testimony, I provided a number of
recommendations about actions that could be considered. In questions and answers I would be happy to talk about any of them.
We cannot allow the debate and actions on this issue to fuel the
targeting of Chinese people—citizens or people of Chinese descent.
I believe that there can be broad bipartisan support for commonsense approaches that recognize the diversity strengthens, not
weakens us. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Prepared Testimony
of Michael Wessel
before the joint
Oversight and Research and Technology Subcommittees
House Science, Space and Technology Committee
Aprilll, 2018
Chairs Abraham and Comstock. Ranking Members Beyer and Lipinski. Members of the
Committee. I want to thank you for your invitation to appear before you today to discuss
foreign nations' exploitation of U.S. academic institutions for the purpose of accessing and
exfiltrating valuable science and technology research and development. It is an honor to appear
before you.
My name is Michael Wessel and I am a Commissioner on the U.S.-China Economic and Security
Review Commission. The Commission was created by Congress in 2001 in conjunction with
the debate about the grant of Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) to China, paving the
way for its accession to the World Trade Organization. The Commission was tasked with
monitoring, investigating and submitting to Congress an annual report on the national security
implications of the bilateral trade and economic relationship between the United States and the
People's Republic of China, and to provide recommendations, where appropriate, to Congress
for legislative and administrative action.
The grant of PNTR ended the annual debate about whether to extend most favored nation status
to China. But even as it passed PNTR, Congress created the Commission because it did not
want to forego the annual review of our relationship with China. Since the creation of the
Commission, our mandate has been extended and altered as the US-China relationship has
evolved. I am the only Commissioner who has served from the Commission's creation and have
witnessed this evolving relationship during that time.
The Commission is a somewhat unique body: We report to and support Congress. Each of the
four Congressional leaders appoint 3 members to the Commission for 2-year terms.

In 7 of the

last l 0 years, we have issued unanimous reports. In the 3 years where it was not unanimous,
there was only one dissenting vote. In many ways, the challenges and opportunities posed by
the relationship with China have united us in our analysis.
While appearing before you in my capacity as a Conunissioner, the views I express are my own,
although, of course, my views are infonncd by the work I and my colleagues do.
Today's hearing is very timely as China's leaders have solidified their power and, in tum, the
ability to fulfill their plans to become a global technology leader, if not the global technology
leader in the not-too-distant future. China has well-developed and aggressive plans in this area.
Their plans are public and provide a clear roadmap for them to follow, and for us to assess.

1

28
Unfortunately, until only the last two years. public policy leaders either largely ignored China's
public pronounc<:ments or simply didn't properly assess their competence and commitment in
reaching those goals. That has been a huge mistake and has led to rapid advancements by China
in ways that have been fueled by U.S. omissions and commissions.
This hearing is also particularly timely in light of the President's actions to confront Chinese
policies in the intellectual property arena. The press is writing about the threatened imposition
of tariffs by both the U.S. and China, but has not focused sufficiently on the underlying issues
that have plagued U.S. businesses and innovators for years. This hearing, in part, will help to
shed light on some of those issues.
China is committed to achieving its goals and will engage in legal means if possible, and illegal
means, if necessary to achieve those goals. There are many areas that fall under the jurisdiction
of this Subcommittee that bear on China's future success. and ours.
Cet1ainly, not everything is a zero-sum game. Important research and advancements in science.
medicine, technology and innovation can improve the lives of people all around the globe.
There is a global commons that must foster global participation by scientists and researchers
allowing for sharing of basic and applied research. Many of the most troubling problems of
yesterday, today and tomoiTOW will only be solved by collaboration.
That ongoing effort, unfm1unately, is being undermined by the activities and operations of the
Chinese govemment and those operating at its direction and on its behalf:
We must act to preserve our own technology and conti·ont China's predatory and protectionist
policies and actions if we are to ensure that that global commons can exist. That requires action
now.
We must ensure that action to address the policies and practices of the Chinese government and
those acting on its behalf or at its direction, does not devolve into approaches that undermine
American ideals and interests. We cannot allow the debate and actions on this issue to fuel the
targeting of Chinese citizens or people of Chinese descent. I believe that there can be broad,
bipartisan suppo11 for common sense approaches that recognize that diversity strengthens, not
weakens us.
From Albet1 Einstein to Hans Bethe 1, and Chien-Shiung Wu 2, foreign nationals have come to the
U.S .. long the world's kader in science. to pursue their studies. The positive impact of foreign
nationals to the world of science and research continues today. Between 2000 and 2014, of the
1

Bethe was a German physicist who emigrated to the U.S. in the 1930s. Bethe would later earn a Nobel Prize in
physics for discovering the reactions that generate energy in stars.
'Wu was born in China, became a U.S. citizen in 1954, and was the first woman elected to the American Physical
Society. Wu would contribute greatly to the Manhattan Project and would later become the first woman to serve
as the president of the American Physical Society.

29
72 U.S. Nobel Prizes awarded in chemistry, medicine and physics, 25 or 35% of them, were
awarded to immigrants.
The Administration's recent Section 301 investigation on the activities by China to force our
companies to transfer their technology to gain market access, as well as protectionist policies and
outright IP theft, documents some of this. The decision to take action to counter these policies is
long overdue. In the past, dialogue and pressure has been a substitute for action and, during that
time, China has dramatically enhanced its capabilities and is either a near peer, or peer, in many
technology domains.
When China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, many economists overestimated or,
indeed, were limited by ideological blinders in thinking China would just continue to compete
against the U.S. in low-value products likes toys and textiles. Last year, China ran a surplus in
Advanced Technology Trade (ATP) with the U.S. of $135.3 billion. The quantity and
composition of our trade with China has changed dramatically since 200 I.
Some of China's advances are the result of our naivete and policy mistakes.
The U.S. has essentially failed to address Chinese industrial policies since its membership in the
WTO. Before that, as early as the mid-1990s, the U.S. took only limited acts against Chinese
intellectual property rights violations. Over the years, several memorandums of understanding
were signed between our two countries meant to throttle back some of China's policies. But.
their illegal acts continue and, indeed, increased in effectiveness. The China Commission has
tracked these mistakes over the years. Numerous public and private reports have documented
these violations as well as these industrial policies and their cost to the U.S. in terms of
production, johs and lost economic benefits.
The U.S. was na!ve in thinking that China wanted to be just like us when it acceded to the WTO.
We viewed the commitments from a "Western". free market. rulc-ot:law perspective. China
simply had and retains a different view of what its commitments meant or, perhaps, simply had
no intention of abiding by the promises they were making.

Our lopsided trade relationship with China has also fueled China's development and advances in
the science and technology arena. Since China joined the WTO, we have amassed an
accumulated merchandise trade deficit of roughly $4.3 trillion. That is a transfer of wealth. It
has allowed China to make massive investments in its future- many of which are to our nation's
disadvantage.
There are policy errors we have made here that have made us vulnerable to many of China's
approaches to advancing their aims. Regarding the specific topic of this hearing, the
exploitation of U.S. academic institutions; public and private funding pressures have provided an
incentive for our colleges and universities to embrace China's well-funded approach. As costs
have risen and budgets have not kept pace, the willingness of international students to pay the
3

30
full cost of tuition is a powerful incentive for their being admitted to our universities and
colleges. Coupled with generous funding for Confucius Institutes, grants and support for
individual professors and graduate students, suppott te)r individuals through the .. 1,000 Talents
Program.. , as well as through other efforts; the temptations are great and China has capitalized on
the desire for funding.
Funding limitations have put additional pressures on other research efforts and overall
development ofS&T in the U.S. According to the National Science Foundation's 2018 Report
on Science and Engineering indicators, the U.S. remains the world's leader in S&T investment.
but that lead is shrinking as China's footprint grows. According to the report. U.S. R&D
expenditures were $496 billion while China was a close second at $408 billion, growing at an
average rate of 18% annually since 2000, as compared to only 4% annual growth in the U.S.
As I noted earlier, approaching the core issue before the Subcommittee today requires a
recognition of the impottance of international cooperation and engagement. But. it's also wa)
past time to directly confront many of the specific programs and policies that China utilizes to
advance its own interests with the clear intent of doing so to the cost of U.S. interests.
My co-panelists today will speak to many of the specific actions and activities that threaten U.S.
interests. I will focus much of my attention on the policies and programs that provide the
framework for the actions.
Confronting China requires that we understand what their plans and programs are. They are
quite public in their direction and goals. One only has to look at their 12'h and 13 1h Five Year
Plans, the so-called China 2025 program and other public pronouncements.
China has made clear that they want to advance their own capabilities in a number of key sectors
for the fhturc. But, they are not simply satisfied with advances. In many areas, they want to
ensure that they have "national" champions who can dominate these sectors; they want to ensure
that they have the capabilities to source their own needs from indigenous companies and they
want to have companies that are significant players internationally. They arc prepared to do
whatever it takes to achieve these goals committing massive funds to accomplish them and
engaging in legal and illegal activities in their pursuit.
What has China Targeted?
China has targeted a broad range of industries for development and preferential status in their
Five-Year Plans and other policy pronouncements. These range from agriculture to metals to
autos to high technology and other sectors. As hlday's hearing is focused primarily on
technology issues, my comments will center around those sectors 3

China's Made in China 2025 Initiative identified 10 key sectors the government would futiher
suppo1i with the goal of foste1ing Chinese leadership in areas of technology with significant
economic and national security implications. They include:
I. New Energy Vehicles
2. Next-Generation Information Technology
3. Biotechnology
4. New Materials
5. Aerospace
6. Ocean Engineering, High-Tech Ships
7. Railway
8. Robotics
9. Power Equipment
I 0. Agricultural Machinery

Each of these sectors in China have benefited from a whole-of-govemment approach to ensuring
that Chinese companies stake out dominant positions in the global market. And, they are
promoting the idea of .. national champions": Companies that hme significant market share and
presence in China to dominate the market.
These national champion companies, many of which are state-owned enterprises, are benefiting
from strong state funding (including provincial and local level supp011), foreign talent and
technology acquisition, an insulated domestic market and even industrial espionage 4 China is
effectively leveraging international openness, particularly that of the U.S. market, academic
community and research institutes, to augment domestic capacity and capabilities with the
ultimate goal of self-sufficiency in advanced teclmologies.
In the case of robotics and AI, two fields of study with the potential to fundamentally change the
international economy as well as the future of war-fighting, China has released the Robotics
Industry Development Plan and Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan with
the goals of China assuming global leadership in the coming decades. For example, in industrial
robotics, toreign companies have been providing the clear majority of installed robotics
demanded in the Chinese market. China acquired Kuka AG, a leading Gennan robotics maker,
in 2016 to advance its efforts. China's state support is seeking to push competitors out of the
market with the stated goal of haYing China's robotics companies meet 70% of that demand, up
from roughly 30% last year, by 2025.
Since the release of these plans, tens of billions of dollars in subsidies and cheap capital have
been provided to Chinese companies who have turned around and used that support to sustain

domestic development and fuel overseas acquisitions of advanced competitors, recruitment of
foreign experts, and funding for related research and development.
For example, China technology giant Baidu, labeled a national champion by China's Ministry of
Science and Technology, has been provided a national AI engineering lab funded by China's
National Development and Rcf01m Commission, has set up research institutes in Silicon Valley,
and recruited top U.S. AI academic researchcrs 5 The impact? In the most recent annual report
to Congress, our Commission found that China, led by Baidu, has reached near-parity with the
U.S. in AI as a result of"robust state-support.··
Money is also a powerful incentive to help China expand its capabilities which, they have made
clear, are to dominate future industries. Just last week, Wired ran a story on how an ex-Google
executive has opened a school in China. with the government's support. The article identified
not only the former Google executive· s involvement. hut support of a number of American
experts. The article indicated that the effort "aligns \\ith a key strand of China's Next
Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan announced last July.
"The plan envisions China's economy, military, and society invigorated and empowered by
artificial intelligence. The government is seeking to build on a recent surge in AI investments
from China's internet companies and others, which has created several startups worth over $1
billion in areas including facial recognition and new types of computer chips. Government
support for AI in China includes new funding, government contracts, and access to some state
data troves. Growing China's AI talent base has also become a major theme, with the
government supporting new programs from colleges and companies.'' 6
How Are U.S. Academic Institutions and Personnel Part of China's Plans'?

China has a number of programs designed to gain access to, infonnation from, and harvest the
gains of, various engagements with U.S. academic institutions as well as students, professors and
researchers. Many of the programs are both public in nature as well as coordinated through
state-led and directed efforts at espionage and intelligence collection.
Perhaps the most well-known program advanced by China in higher education is the propagation
and funding of Confucius Institutes. There are roughly 100 of these Institutes operating in the
U.S. (see attached list). These Chinese-funded educational institutes housed at colleges and
universities around the globe, are designed to teach Chinese language, culture and hist01y.
Similar to eff01is led by Japanese institutions in the 1980s, when tensions between the U.S. and
Japan were high. the Institutes are a tool of"soft power" and long-term influence.

""But the Confucius Institutes' goals arc little less wholesome and edifying than they sound- and
this by the Chinese government's mvn account. A 2011 speech by a standing member of the
Politburo in Beijing laid out the case: 'The Confucius Institute is an appeal brand for expanding
our culture abroad. ' Li Changchun said. 'It has made an important contribution toward
improving our soft power. The 'Confucius' brand has a natural attractiveness. Using the excuse
of teaching Chinese language, everything looks reasonable and logical.'" 7
At a time of funding pressures on higher education, the attraction of Chinese money can be
substantial. But, China is not engaged in a charitable endeavor: It is seeking to influence the
current and future generations of America's leaders, their views and their research. China has
substantial influence, if not direct control, over the hiring of personnel, the curriculum and the
materials that are utilized at the Institutes. As Peter Mattis with the Jamestown Foundation
recently noted. "By facilitating U.S. universities investment in facilities, research collaboration,
or programs, the CCP (Chinese Communist Party), creates a vulnerable relationship that can be
used to apply pressure to the university unless the latter is prepared to walk away." 8
Last week, Texas A&M terminated its Confucius Institute after Congressmen McCaul and
Cuellar raised questions about Texas university partnerships with the Chinese-government run
entities. "These organizations are a threat to our nation's security by serving as a platfonn for
China's intelligence collection and political agenda," McCaul and Cuellar said in a news release.
"We have a responsibility to uphold our American values of free expression, and to do whatever
is necessary to counter any behavior that poses a threat to our democracy. "9
As Richard P. Suttmeier identified in a report prepared for the China Commission in 2014,
..China's owrall engagement with U.S. S&T has undoubtedly played a major role in the
development of Chinese wealth and power. This is especially true with regard to the
exploitation of higher education oppmiunities at U.S. universities and the transfer of U.S.
technologies as pati of U.S. companies· business decisions." 10
In 2015 testimony before the China Commission. David Major indicated that ''PRC intelligence
will target and exploit PRC college students overseas and foreign students studying in China,
trade and cultural delegations, and attempt to first identify any ethnic Chinese (Han) that may be
in a position to 'hdp · China .... The Chinese approach or pitch in the majority of cases is ·can you

A number of specific cases have become public over the years regarding efforts to target U.S.
academic institutions for intelligence collection. A couple of specific cases are:
•

•

•

2008- John Reese Roth, University of Tennessee. Electrical engineering professor Roth
vvas convicted of exporting '·defense articles'' without a license, and of wire tl'aud and
conspiracy. Roth used Chinese students in research on a plasma-based flight-control
device for drone aircraft under a U.S. Air Force contract. Two of those students
illegally, gained access to sensitive information and exported it to China. 12
2009 -- Ruopeng Lieu, Duke University. Dr. Liu reportedly passed data from his time at
Duke's metamaterials lab to help create a "mirror"' institute in China. This allegedly led
to the 2010 creation ofKuang-Chi Science Limited, now a multi-billion metamaterials
company in the wireless internet and mobile payment field.
2015 --Chinese Professors among 6 defendants charged with economic espionage by the
Department of Justice. The 32-count indictment, which had previously been sealed,
charges a total of six individuals with economic espionage and theft of trade secrets for
their roles in a long-mnning effort to obtain trade secrets for the benefit of universities
and companies controlled by the PRC government. 13

In 2006. China launched '·Project II I .. with the goal of recruiting 1.000 foreign experts in
strategic sectors from the world's top universities. Two years lat<:r. the "Thousand Talents
Program" was introduced with a similar, but expanded goal of foreign expert recmitment.
According to the FBI, the Thousand Talents program began with the goal ofrecmiting 2,000
foreign professionals over a five- to ten-year period and focused primarily on ethnic Chinese
experts at western universities and research institutes. 14 That goal has since been expanded and
extended and to-date, has brought more than 4,000 foreign experts (including non-etlmic Chinese
scholars) to China. 15
The package of benefits for those participating in the program are extensive. The qualifications
sought are those "under 55 years of age who are willing to work in China on a full-time basis,
with full professorships or the equivalent in prestigious foreign universities and R&D institutes,

or with senior titles from well-known international companies or financial institutes. 16 Each
participant will receive a one-time start-up payment of roughly $158,000 in addition to salary
based on previous levels and other significant benefits. 17
The FB!"s Counterintelligence Strategic Partnership has warned that these programs pose a threat
to our nation's academic community:
Chinese Talent Programs pose a serious threat to U.S. businesses and universities
through economic espionage and theft of intellectual property. The different
programs focus on spccificfields deemed critical to China, ro boost China '.1
national capability in S&T fields. These subject matter experts often are not
required to sign non-disclosure agreements with U.S. entities, which could result
in loss of unprotected in/iJrmmion ... One ofthe greatest threats toward these
experts is transferring or transporting proprietmy. classified, or exportcontrolled il!f'ormation, or intellectual proper(y, ;vhich can lead to criminal
charges. 1x

As the FBI"s 2011 report. Higher Education and National Security: The Targeting of Sensitive,
Proprietary and Classified l.nf(l!mation on Campuses of Higher Education indicated, ..(m)ost
foreign students, researchers, or professors studying or working in the United States arc here for
legitimate and proper reasons. Only a very small percentage is actively working at the behest of
another government or organization. However, some foreign govemments also pressure
legitimate students to report information to intelligence officials, often using the promise of
favors or threats to family members back home... The report was issued to help inform ··public
and private entities about counterintelligence risks and national security issws:·
The size of the foreign student population in the U.S. is significant. In the 2016-17 academic
year, there were 1,078,822 international students studying in the U.S. China was the largest
place of origin for these students, accounting for 32.5% of the total (roughly 350,000). The top
fields of study for foreign students were engineering, business and management, and math and
computer science. Chinese students were most likely to pursue these areas of study accounting
tor 57% of all Chinese students in the U.S. 19
Chinese students have a significant presence on many campuses and in many labs where critical
research is being done. Many of these labs received significant federal funding from the
Department of Defense or the National Science Foundation.

The Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) Lab at the University of California
at Berkeley is a leading AI facility working on advanced computer vision, machine
learning, natural language processing and robotics. Roughly 20 percent of the PhD
students at BAIR arc PRC nationals.

•

The University ofMarylancrs Bing Nano Research Group works on materials science,
focusing on energy storage, nano-manufacturing and biomaterials. Thirty of the 38 postdoctoral researchers and graduate students are from China. Every one of the visiting
researchers and professors utilizing ··r visas are from China 20 • The lab receives support
from IS different federal agencies including NASA, DARPA, The Air Force Office of
Scientific Research and the Department of Energy.

It is also important to recognize that education is counted as an export in our nation's trade
balance. With continued focus on our nation's trade deficit. the contribution of $39.4 billion in
education expenditures by foreign students is significant. The goal must be to address the real
risks we face without undennining or stifling the contribution of international students to our
understanding of the world and their contributions to campus diversity and, in monetary terms,
the contribution to our schools and our country.

The National Security Higher Education Advisory Board was created in September 2005 and is
comprised of government and university ofiicials. It is one venue for addressing some of these
issues but has a broad mandate. that includes terrorism, homeland security and
counterintelligence. As such, it is not as focused on the long-term economic and security threats
posed by many of China's activities many of which, on their own may appear innocuous but
together, create en01mous vulnerabilities for our long-tenn success in many of these critical
technologies. The Committee may want to meet with members of the Board to assess their
activities and determine whether enhanced activities are appropriate.
There arc numerous bilateral scientific cooperation programs between our two countries. 21 In
work at the China Commission over the years, we have questioned witnesses on the value of
some of these programs. While, again, expanding global knowledge to address key problems

facing nations around the globe is a proper goal, much of the testimony we have heard indicates
that Chinese participants get much more value from these exchanges than do U.S. participants.
Of course, some of that is understandable in light ofthc advanced nature of U.S. work in many
sectors. But. as China's capabilities expand. the lopsided nature of these exchanges raises

selious questions as to their utility. China is harvesting many of the gains and often utilizes any
research to its advantage at the expense of U.S. interests.
Conclusion and Recommendations:

Today's hearing is focused on the exploitation of U.S. academic institutions. These instimtions
arc a critical component of our overall basic and applied research infrastructure and key to our
nation's economic and national security. While we should continue to work to contribute to the
world's efforts to address the most vexing problems facing the world. we must take greater steps
to protect the fruits of our work. Efforts in infiltrate our universities and labs and exfiltratc their
work must be a greater priority.
Sunlight is a great disinfectant and today's hearing is an important step in that process. Raising
awareness of the potential risks associated with academic activities vis-a-vis U.S. interests is key.
Coupled with that, there are some basic steps that can be taken:
•

•

•
•

Schools engaged in research in critical technologies must implement appropriate cyber
security measures to protect intellectual property and infonnation. Laboratories
receiving federal funding for research in these areas would have to periodically certify
that they are adhering to appropriate standards.
There must be greater monitoring and oversight of visa holders to ensure that the original
terms of their being granted are adhered to. Universities and colleges should partner
with appropriate govemment authorities to provide updated inf01mation on visa holders
and the programs they participate in. The Administration should maintain a
comprehensive and updated database regarding the field of smdies of visa holders
Participants in China's 1.000 Talent Program should be prohibited from receiving future
federal support in terms of grants, loans or other assistance.
Universities receiving federal support should report on any cooperative research
programs or exchanges in the science and technology arena with Chinese-funded entities.
Personnel participating in such programs should be required to review prepared materials
from the law enforcement c01mnunity on intelligence gathering efforts and methods of
foreign countries and should be required to file periodic reports.
Confucius Institute personnel should be required to file as foreign agents under the
Foreign Agents Registration Act.
Materials utilized at Confucius Institutes should include a disclaimer that it was prepared
with the support. oversight and control of an entity associated with the Chinese
Government.

Again, thank you for the invitation to appear before you today and I look forward to working
with the Committee as it assesses this important issue.

Chairman ABRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. Wessel.
I now recognize Honorable Michelle Van Cleave for five minutes
to present her testimony.
TESTIMONY OF THE HONORABLE MICHELLE VAN CLEAVE,
FORMER NATIONAL COUNTERINTELLIGENCE EXECUTIVE

Ms. VAN CLEAVE. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, and Members of the Committee.
I had the honor of serving as the first national head of U.S. counterintelligence. I was appointed by President Bush in 2003, and I
have spent the years since leaving office with a continuing sense
of gratitude for the honor of having served in that capacity and a
continuing sense of obligation to share what I learned. I’m especially grateful, therefore, for the opportunity to be here this morning to share some of these insights with you as they pertain to the
subject of today’s hearing.
The United States is a spy’s paradise. Our free and open society
is tailor-made for clandestine operations. As this committee is so
well aware, American R&D, the engine for raw ideas and products
and capabilities and wealth, is systematically targeted by foreign
collectors to fuel their business and industry and military programs
at our expense.
China and Russia both have detailed shopping lists of targeted
U.S. technologies and specific strategies for clandestine acquisition,
ranging from front companies to joint R&D projects to cyber theft
to old-fashioned espionage. U.S. academic institutions with their
great concentration of creative talents and cutting-edge research
and open engagement with the world of ideas are an especially attractive environment for these kinds of activities.
Let me say the numbers are frankly staggering. For every dollar
we invest, some $510 billion annually, we lose most if not all of
that equivalent amount to these kinds of illicit activities every
year. Each year, reports out of U.S. counterintelligence show numbers that are worse than the year before. Losses are growing, numbers of foreign collectors are growing, vulnerabilities are growing,
and the erosion of U.S. security and economic strength is also
growing.
So why don’t we do more to disrupt these operations before adversaries make off with our trade secrets, our national security secrets, and other valuable information? Let me ask you to hold that
thought.
The last time I sat in this witness chair was five years ago at
another Oversight hearing on this very subject. In fact, Mr. Chairman, as we were sitting here having that hearing, the case that
you referenced, the MRI exfiltration at NYU, there were surveillance cameras watching them at that very moment. And toward
the end of that hearing, one of the members asked me very pointedly, ‘‘Isn’t there a way we can go on offense? Isn’t there a way?’’
‘‘Yes,’’ I answered, ‘‘there is, but national security leadership must
be prepared to change the way we do the counterintelligence business if we are going to do that.’’ So today, I’d like to pick up at that
bottom line and get to that point.
Unlike most other nations in the world, the United States has
never had a national counterintelligence service. Instead, counter-

40
intelligence grew up as part of the distributed responsibilities of
the three operational agencies—the FBI, whose principal responsibility is to find the spies here and put them in jail; the CIA, whose
job is to make sure that their clandestine collection operates securely in all the realms in which it is asked to operate; and the
military services, who have to be worried about foreign intelligence
threats to our military operations abroad.
And they’re all very good at what they do. But throughout our
history, most of our history, there was no national head of counterintelligence to integrate all of these various activities or to provide
a common picture of the threat or to identify gaps or to warn of
these activities. And 16 years ago, the Congress took a look at this
and said this isn’t working right. We have got to make some
changes.
The Counterintelligence Enhancement Act of 2002 was passed to
create a national head of counterintelligence to integrate all these
things—to provide warning of foreign intelligence threats to the
United States, to find ways of filling in the seams so that foreign
espionage couldn’t exploit those seams, and to make sure that we
were aware of these kinds of strategic threats to our activities,
these kinds of R&D exfiltration, and broader threats to the United
States, information threats, cyber exploitation, influence operations. These were the things that the office that I headed was
asked to worry about.
And when I served in that job, we took a look at how CI was distributed in this country, and we said, you know, tinkering around
the edges isn’t going to do. We need to make substantial changes
in the way we do these operations. We need to have a strategic
counterintelligence program that knits together different activities,
that characterizes a threat, that gets ahead of the threat, by understanding how these foreign intelligence services operate, how they
are structured, how they’re tasked, and and what their
vulnerabilities are so that we can get inside of them and stop them
before they hurt us.
Unfortunately, the strategy that President Bush issued to go
forth and do these things in a proactive way was never implemented. Now, why is that? Well, it was signed in 2005. That was
the same year that the Director of National Intelligence Office was
first created. There was a lot of new bureaucracy and many new
priorities, which pulled away resources and direction from what we
were trying to do.
At the same time, the bigger problem was there was no real strategic counterintelligence program that the new law mandated, so it
was easy not to follow through on these things because there was
no requirement in fact to do that.
I know my time is short, but I do want to urge that we spend
a little time talking more about what can be done and how effective
we could be if we worked our counterintelligence as a strategic tool
of the nation’s national security strategy. That possibility is open
to us. And I will suggest to you that if we continue to just go along
with the old business model of how we’ve been working case by
case by case instead of going after the service proactively as a target, as I know our professional community in fact could do if national leadership gave them that direction, we will continue to have

41
these unacceptable losses to our nation. Changes are possible. Good
things can happen, but leadership is required. Thank you.

April 11, 2018

Joint hearing on foreign notions' exploitation of U.S. academic institutions for the purpose of
accessing and exfiltrating valuable science and technology {S& T} research and development
Co-Chairs Abraham and Comstock, Ranking Members Beyer and Lipinski:
It is a privilege to appear again before this Committee, where early in my career I had the honor
of serving as Minority Counsel. The last time I testified before the Oversight Subcommittee was
five years ago, also on the subject of espionage threats to America's science and technology
base. I recall nodding in agreement with my fellow panelists:

•

The open exchange of ideas is essential not only to discovery and research, but also to
America's leadership and values, said one of the country's most distinguished

•

China is saving incalculable amounts of time, money and research effort through
espionage and intellectual property theft directed against the U.S, said the expert from

engineers.

the U.S. China Commission.

•

The numbers of economic espionage coses and export control violations are increasing
every year, and we don't have the resources to keep up with them, said the former FBI
special agent.

So what should we do? asked the Chairman. What indeed.
For even as our hearing was underway, surveillance cameras at NYU's medical center were
capturing an associate professor of radiology and two research assistants all from China secretly photographing MRI technology developed by another team under a $4 million NIH
grant, which (the criminal complaint alleges) they were "sharing" with a research institute
sponsored by the Chinese government. 1 Their subsequent arrests and later plea deals are but a
drop in an overflowing bucket.

As this Committee is well aware, American R&D --the engine for new ideas and products and
capabilities and wealth -- is systematically targeted by foreign collectors to fuel their business
and industry and military programs at our expense. By far the vast majority of foreign
acquisition of U.S. technology is open and lawful, as are the transactions of individuals and
businesses involved in international commerce, as well as the free exchange of ideas in
scientific and academic forums. Even so, while the United States leads in the world in R&D
spending, with annual investments of some $S10 billion/ we are losing most if not more of that
dollar amount every year through systematic theft. 3 It continues to be what Gen. Keith
Alexander, then Director of the National Security Agency, memorably called "the greatest
transfer of wealth in history." That was six years ago ... and counting.
China, which accounts for nearly a third of the growing foreign student population in the United
States4 and the lion's share ($385 billion in 2017) of our trade deficit, 5 easily tops the threat
list. It's not just that there are a lot of Chinese nationals working in American companies or
laboratories, or studying or teaching at American universities, picking up whatever happens to
come their way. No. As the Defense Department has reported, 6 China has a governmentdirected, multi-faceted secret program whose primary task is technology acquisition, as well as
a highly refined strategy to develop and exploit access to advantageous information through
the global telecommunications infrastructure.
In fact, China and Russia both have detailed shopping lists of targeted U.S. technologies and
specific strategies for clandestine acquisition, ranging from front companies to joint R&D
projects to cyber theft to old fashioned espionage; nor are they alone. There is also a third
party black market for that stolen S&T, for both commercial and military buyers.
In other words, foreign targeting of the U.S. science and technology base is driven by
purposeful collection, tasking and exploitation by foreign nations who employ the full reach of
their intelligence capabilities to that end. And business is booming.
Indeed, the United States is a spy's paradise. Our free and open society is tailor-made for
clandestine operations. Most of the golden eggs worth collecting are found within our borders:
military plans, diplomatic strategies, weapons designs, nuclear secrets, proprietary R&D from
companies such as Bell Labs or Dupont or Boeing. And foreign powers are running intelligence
operations throughout the United States with unprecedented independence from the safe
havens of their diplomatic establishments, leaving our counterintelligence efforts in the dust.

U.S. academic institutions, with their great concentration of creative talent, cutting edge
research endeavors, and open engagement with the world of ideas, are an especially attractive
environment for foreign collectors targeting America's R&D wealth. The advent of social media
has opened the door even wider. As FBI Director Christopher Wray explained before the
Senate Intelligence Committee earlier this year,
The use of non-traditional collectors, especially in the academic settingwhether it's professors, scientists, students- we see in almost every field office
that the FBI has around the country. It's not just in major cities. It's in small
ones as well, it's across basically every discipline. And I think the level of naivete
on the part of the academic sector about this creates its own issues.
They're exploiting the very open research and development environment that
we have, which we all revere. But they're taking advantage of this. One of the
things we're trying to do is to view the Chinese threat as not just a whole of
government threat, but a whole-of-society threat, on their end. And I think it's
going to take a whole-of-society response by us. It's not just the Intelligence
Community, but it's raising awareness within our academic sector, within our
private sector, as part of defense. 7
Raising awareness is obviously an important part of the answer. But so is raising our ability to
act. And that's not a private sector job; it's a U.S. government job.
Year after year, we dutifully collect data about how much of our nation's wealth is
hemorrhaging out the door through illicit foreign collection. For its part, the Congress properly
attempts to raise awareness through hearings such as this, passes new legislation to strengthen
law enforcement's reach and victims' legal recourse, gives the President sanctions authority,
and advances security measures to protect against these activities. Yet, as important as they
are, more robust security programs, awareness training, FOCI regulations, diplomatic
demarches and tech transfer laws alone- the current suite of our technology protection efforts
-will never be enough to stop these massive programs of state-orchestrated technology theft.
Which brings me back to our hearing, five years ago. Toward the end, one of the Members
asked pointedly, Isn't there a way we can go on offense? Yes, I answered, there most certainly
is- but national leadership must be willing to revamp our counterintelligence enterprise to get
there.
To be sure,
Today I thought we might pick up where that conversation left off.
counterintelligence is only one part of the policy mix that is needed to effectively counter illicit
technology acquisition. But I have observed that the government's ability to identify and
disrupt foreign intelligence operations is the piece too often neglected in open discussions such
as this ... or even within national security councils behind closed doors.

Why is that? Perhaps because counterintelligence is seen as the purview of intelligence and
therefore not usefully addressed in the open. Or perhaps because its potential contributions to
national security are simply not generally understood. Yet if war is too important to be left to
the generals, as Clemenceau famously said, then counterintelligence is too important to be left
to the intelligence community.
Accordingly, I'd like to provide some background on how U.S. counterintelligence has evolved
over the years, why it is not optimized for sweeping strategic challenges such as the subject of
today's hearing, and what needs to be done now.
The work of clandestine services, engaged in intelligence collection and other activities, is an
arena of international competition where the advantage does not necessarily go to the rich or
the otherwise powerful. Foreign adversaries may not have a prayer of fielding costly and
technologically demanding technical collection suites, but they can organize, train, equip,
sustain and deploy impressive numbers of case officers, agents of influence, saboteurs, hackers
and spies; and the United States has become the single most important collection target in the
world. Intelligence operations against the United States are now more diffuse, more
aggressive, more technologically sophisticated, and potentially more successful than ever
before, especially within U.S. borders, where America's rich, free society and an extensive
foreign presence provide opportunity and cover for intelligence services and their agents.
By contrast, counterintelligence (CI)- identifying, assessing and neutralizing foreign intelligence
threats-- has been little more than an afterthought in U.S. national security strategy, 8 a legacy
of neglect that has cost us dearly in lives lost, resources squandered, and dangers unchecked.
Sixteen years ago, in the wake of a devastating espionage case that shook the U.S. intelligence
community to its core, 9 with worse to come, 1 Congress took a hard look at the Cl enterprise
and saw that it was little changed from the set pieces that emerged after World War II. The
three major operating elements each had become highly proficient in their respective Cl
responsibilities: 1) the FBI, far and away the largest Cl organization in the U.S. government,
whose principal job is to find the spies and arrest them; 2) CIA, whose main Cl concern is to
make sure our spies succeed; and 3) the Defense Department, charged with protecting against
enemy intelligence operations. These are all vital missions.

°

Yet foreign intelligence services don't target an FBI field office, or a CIA station, or a military
installation abroad; they target the United States.

Notably, none of the National Security Strategy guidance issued by U.S Presidents over the past four decades has
addressed countering foreign intelligence threats as part of national policy or strategy ... including the latest

So whose job was it to perform systematic collection or analysis of foreign intelligence threats
to the United States? To build a common operating picture of the threat against which to array
our Cl operations? To ensure a coherent assignment of resources to counter foreign
intelligence activities?
Historically the answer was "no one." The National Security Act of 1947 established the basic
contours of the post-war U.S. intelligence community, but (other than defining the term 11 } said
nothing about counterintelligence. In the decades since, we had no central leadership of U.S.
counterintelligence, no agreed guiding principles or Cl doctrine common to the discipline, and
no national-level orchestration of U.S. counterintelligence activities against foreign intelligence
threats to the United States.
In other words, while the threat is strategic, our Cl enterprise was not designed to enable a
There was no overarching national leadership to provide cohesion or
strategic response.
strategic direction for our Cl activities. And no government entity had been given responsibility
to ensure that foreign intelligence threats to the United States were identified, assessed and
neutralized to protect America's national and economic security and advance our country's vital
interests.
The Counterintelligence Enhancement Act of 2002 stepped into the void to create for the first
time a national head of U.S. counterintelligence. The purpose was twofold:
•

•

First, to close the seams that existed between the fiefdoms of the several operating
agencies, which were being exploited by spies seeking a way into U.S. national security
secrets. (E.g., Russian agents inside the U.S. government like Aldrich Ames at CIA and
Robert Hanssen at the FBI had benefited from those seams for 9 and 21 years
respectively, and DIA analyst Ana Montes- Cuba's star asset- for 17.}
The second, equally compelling purpose was to develop and execute a national
counterintelligence strategy to protect the United States against foreign intelligence
threats targeting the riches of our economy and the openness of our society- a growth
industry leading into the 21st century.

When President Bush appointed me to the new post, we conducted a top-to-bottom review of
the U.S. counterintelligence landscape and concluded that tinkering around the edges wouldn't
do. The national counterintelligence enterprise needed to be reconfigured to go on the
offense, to exploit where we can, and interdict where we must, with the purpose of degrading
adversary intelligence services and their ability to work against us.
The first National Counterintelligence Strategy of the United States, issued by President Bush in
"[E]ach member of the
2005, had this proactive reorientation as its central goal.
counterintelligence community must be prepared to assume new responsibilities, and join

11 As defined in the National Security Act of 1947, "Counterintelligence means information gathered and

activities conducted to protect against espionage, other intelligence activities, sabotage, or assassinations
conducted for or on behalf of foreign powers, organizations or persons, or international terrorist activities".

together in a unity of effort ... " 12 But before the ink was dry, the new office of the Director of
National Intelligence {DNI) was established along with a new bureaucracy that steered policy
and funding away from our nascent efforts to create a strategic Cl capability.B
Unfortunately, the backsliding continued under President Obama. A directive {lCD 750) issued
by DNI Jim Clapper in 2013 and still in force explicitly devolves authority and responsibility for
The national head of
all Cl programs down to the department/agency level.'4
counterintelligence was rebranded director of a security and Cl center, his duties further
dissipated by the fixation on leaks and insider threats driven by the grievous harm done by
Snowden, Manning, et at. Gone was any dedicated strategic Cl program, while elite pockets of
proactive capabilities died of neglect. Read between the lines of existing Cl guidance and you
will not find a whiff of a national-level effort left, other than caretaker duties such as taking
inventory and writing reports.
Here's the problem. In creating a new head of U.S. counterintelligence, Congress sought to
bring strategic coherence to our efforts to identify and neutralize the growing panoply of
foreign intelligence threats: espionage, technology theft, deception and denial, and influence
operations. But the means of execution- a strategic counterintelligence program --was never
put in place.
Sixteen years after the creation of the national Cl office, we're back to square one.
U.S. counterintelligence is finely tuned to work individual cases, but it is not postured globally
to detect, deter or disrupt the intelligence activities of China or any other foreign power, or to
execute strategic counterintelligence operations. Under the current business model, there is
no national level system that enables the integration and coordination of the diverse activities
of U.S. counterintelligence to achieve common strategic objectives. There is no standard
approach to targeting among the counterintelligence elements of the FBI, CIA and DOD;
interagency information sharing is poor, and infrastructure support even worse. Even the
modest national mechanisms developed to deconflict offensive Cl activities stop at the water's
edge, a legacy of the old divide between foreign and domestic operational realms.
In order to "go on offense," the U.S. government would need a means for identifying and
neutralizing foreign intelligence activities directed against U.S. interests as an integral national
security tool -something we do not have today. We know surprisingly little about adversary
intelligence services relative to the harm they can do. And no single entity has a complete
picture to provide warning of possible foreign intelligence successes, to support operations, or
to formulate policy options for the president and his national security leaders.

Going on offense also means not waiting until the threat is here, in our own backyard. We
need to ask, how are adversary services trained, tasked, and funded? Where do they operate,
against what targets, with what support? What is their leadership structure, their personnel
rosters, their critical nodes of operation, the doctrine by which they deploy? And what are their
vulnerabilities? What are the indicators that might give us warning of intelligence operations
against us? Are there tripwires we can design to give us an edge? With such analytic insights,
U.S. counterintelligence could seize the initiative and begin by working the target abroad, with
the purpose of selectively degrading the foreign intelligence service and its ability to work
against us.
To do that, the United States needs a strategic Cl program- the budgets, billets, and processes
to enable the integrated planning, orchestration and execution of Cl operations to get inside
hostile intelligence services, find their vulnerabilities, and neutralize them as national policy
may dictate.
As the Congress considers how to close the floodgates of pilfered technology - or how to
it would be
respond to Russian influence operations against our democratic institutions
instructive to take a fresh look at the Counterintelligence Enhancement Act, the performance of
the national Cl office, and the long-overdue modernization of our nation's Cl enterprise.
Successive administrations have let this vital mission slide, and we are paying the price in terms
of America's vulnerability to technology theft and a long list of foreign adversaries and
competitors who know an opportunity when they see it.
In my view, the choice is simple. We can handle these threats piecemeal, or we can pull
together a strategic program -- one team, one plan, one goal -- to reduce the overall danger.
We can chase individual spies or technology thieves case by case, or we can target the services
that send them here. In short, we can go on offense ... but national leadership must be willing
to direct and empower America's counterintelligence enterprise to carry out that vital mission.

Chairman ABRAHAM. Thank you, Ms. Van Cleave.
I now recognize Mr. Daniel Golden for five minutes.
TESTIMONY OF MR. DANIEL GOLDEN,
AUTHOR, SPY SCHOOLS

Mr. GOLDEN. Thank you. I’d like to thank the Committee for inviting me and——
Chairman ABRAHAM. Mr. Golden, if you will push that button
and put that mic on.
Mr. GOLDEN. Thank you. Thanks very much to the Committee
for inviting me. I’m delighted to be here with such distinguished
fellow panelists. In fact, Michelle, I quote her prior congressional
testimony in my book Spy Schools.
My book examines both foreign and domestic espionage activity
at U.S. universities, but my testimony today will focus on foreign
theft of federally funded academic research.
The number of foreign students and faculty has mushroomed
over the past 40 years. In 2016, the number of international students at U.S. universities topped 1 million for the first time, almost
seven times the total in 1975 and more than double the 2000 figure. And of course they were basically no Chinese students here before 1978.
The number of foreign-born scientists and engineers working at
U.S. colleges and universities rose 44 percent between 2003 and
2013, and in key technical fields like engineering and computer
science, American universities award more than half of their doctorates to international students.
Educational globalization has many benefits: diverse perspectives
in the classroom cross-cultural understanding, skilled labor for research, collaboration of the world’s best minds, and the advancement of learning. But there is an alarming side effect.
Globalization has transformed American universities into a frontline for espionage. Some small but significant percentage of international students and faculty come to help their countries gain recruits for clandestine operations, insights into U.S. Government
plans, and access to sensitive military and civilian research. Academic solicitation defined as the use of students, professors, scientists, and researchers as collectors tripled from eight percent of
all foreign efforts to obtain sensitive or classified information in fiscal year 2010 to 24 percent in 2014, according to the Defense Security Service.
For foreign intelligence services, a university offers a valuable
and lightly guarded target. They can exploit the revolving door between academia and government. Today’s Professor of International Relations is tomorrow’s Assistant Secretary of State. They
can recruit naive students and guide them into the federal agency
of their choice.
Academic research offers a vulnerable and low-risk target for foreign espionage. University laboratories are often less protected
than their corporate counterparts, reflecting a culture oriented toward collaboration. Typically, university researchers aren’t required to sign nondisclosure agreements, which run counter to the
ethic of openness. Open campuses also make it simple to gather intelligence. Spies with no academic affiliation can slip unnoticed

51
into seminars, student centers, libraries, and cafeterias and befriend the computer scientist or Pentagon advisor sitting beside
them.
And academia’s old-fashioned gentlemanly culture abets espionage. All it takes for professors in different countries to agree to
collaborate on research is a phone call, an email, or perhaps a
handshake at a conference. There’s not necessarily a contract that
explicitly spells out what data or equipment each side has access
to. Many science students and faculty are unfamiliar with intellectual property safeguards.
University administrations largely overlook this threat in part
for financial and reputational reasons. They’re ramping up enrollment of full-paying international students an opening campuses
abroad, which are often subsidized by the host countries.
The story of one Chinese graduate student at Duke University illustrates how vulnerable academic research is to foreign raiders
and how little universities do to protect it. I came across this saga
when, through a public records request, I obtained the agenda of
an October 2012 meeting of the National Security Higher Education Advisory Board, which I heard today was recently disbanded. One agenda item stated that Duke University Professor
David Smith, quote, ‘‘will discuss how, without his knowledge, a
Chinese national targeted his lab and published and exploited Dr.
Smith’s research to create a mirror institute in China.’’ The episode
cost Duke significantly in licensing, patents, and royalties, and
kept Smith from being the first to publish groundbreaking research.
I soon learned that Smith was a renowned researcher who had
helped launch the fast-growing field of meta-materials, artificial
materials with properties not found in nature. His lab had invented
the first invisibility cloak ala Harry Potter, although it only concealed objects from microwaves, not the human eye, and that his
lab had Pentagon funding to develop ways of making weapons invisible.
And I identified the Chinese national as Ruopeng Liu, a former
graduate student in Smith’s lab. Through interviews with Smith
and other lab members, I discovered that Liu had left a trail of specifics suspicious behavior, arranging for Chinese scientists to visit
the Duke lab and photograph its equipment, passing them data
and ideas developed by unwitting colleagues at Duke, deceiving
Smith into committing to work part-time in China by enlisting him
under false pretenses to participate in the brain-game program
called Project 111 that Michael mentioned, and secretly starting a
Chinese website based on the work at Duke.
After numerous warnings from other members of the lab and
questions from the Pentagon, Smith finally began to suspect Liu
and took away his key to the lab, but Duke still gave him a doctorate. Liu noted in an interview for my book that the invisibility
research was considered basic but the are advantages even to stealing open research, mainly saving time and avoiding mistakes. With
a mole in a U.S. university laboratory, researchers overseas can
publish and patent an idea first, ahead of the true pioneers, and
enjoy the consequent acclaim, funding, and surging interest from
top students and faculty. In fact, a foreign government may be

52
eager to scoop up a fundamental breakthrough before its applications become so important that it’s labeled secret and foreign students lose access to it.
Universities should be more smarter and more sophisticated
about the intelligence ramifications of research collaborations, student and faculty exchanges, academic conferences, and international admissions. I’d like to see more training and courses in intellectual property rights, contractual agreements for cross-border
collaborations that spell out each side’s access to data and equipment, and orientation sessions for conferences on study-abroad programs that include tips on recognizing come-ons from intelligence
agencies. And if students or alumni are exposed as foreign spies,
universities should deny or revoke their degrees rather than looking the other way.
As Americans, we’re all concerned and rightly so about foreign
intelligence services interfering in our elections. Like democratic
elections, a robust, open, and intellectually curious system of higher education is a hallmark of our society we should take pains to
protect it as well. Thank you.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Golden follows:]

House Science Committee testimony April !!/Daniel Golden

I would like to thank the committee for inviting me. I am testifying in my personal capacity as
the author of"Spy Schools: How the CIA, FBI, and Foreign Intelligence Secretly Exploit
America's Universities," rather than as a senior editor at Pro Publica. Although my book
examines both foreign and domestic espionage at U.S. universities, my testimony today will
focus on foreign theft of federally- funded academic research.
The number of foreign students and faculty has mushroomed for the past 40 years. In 2016, the
number of international students at U.S. universities topped 1 million for the first time,
almost seven times the total in 1975 and more than double the 2000 figure, though the
numbers are starting to level off now. The number of foreign-born scientists and
engineers working at U.S. colleges and universities rose 44 percent in the decade
between 2003 and 2013, from 360,000 to 517,000. In key teclmical fields such as
engineering and computer science, American universities award more than half of doctorates to
international students.
Educational globalization has many benefits: diverse perspectives in the classroom; crosscultural understanding; skilled labor for research; collaboration of the world's best minds in the
advancement of learning.
But there's an alarming side-effect. Globalization has transformed American universities
into a front line for espionage. Some small but significant percentage of international students
and faculty come to help their countries gain recruits for clandestine operations, insights into
U.S. government plans, and access to sensitive military and civilian research. Academic
solicitation, or "the use of students, professors, scientists or researchers as collectors," tripled
from 8 percent of all foreign efforts to obtain sensitive or classified information in fiscal 20 I 0 to

54
24 percent in 2014, according to the Defense Security Service, a Defense Department agency
that protects American technology.

For foreign intelligence services, a university offers a valuable and lightly
guarded target. They can exploit the revolving door between academia and
government: today's professor of international relations is tomorrow's assistant
secretary of state. They can recruit naive students and guide them into the federal
agency of their choice.

Universities undertake a growing amount of government-funded research, much of
it sensitive. The U.S. government spent $27.4 billion on academic R&D in 2014,
triple the tab in 1990. That includes $2.4 billion from the Pentagon and intelligence
agencies

not counting the CIA, which doesn't publicly report expenditures.

Academic research offers a valuable, vulnerable, and low-risk target for foreign
espionage. Despite pursuing groundbreaking technologies for the Pentagon and the
intelligence community, university laboratories are less protected than their
corporate counterparts, reflecting a culture oriented toward collaboration and
protection. Typically, university researchers aren't required to sign nondisclosure
agreements, which run counter to the ethic of openness.

Open campuses make it simple to gather intelligence. Spies with no academic

55
affiliation can slip unnoticed into seminars, student centers, libraries, and cafeterias
pretty much anywhere except laboratories conducting classified research - and
befriend the computer scientist or Pentagon adviser sitting beside them.

Academia's old-fashioned, gentlemanly culture also abets espionage. All it takes
for professors in different countries to agree to collaborate on research is a phone
call, an email, or perhaps a handshake at a conference. There's not necessarily a
contract that explicitly spells out what data or equipment each side has access to.
Many science students and faculty are unfamiliar with intellectual property
safeguards. In one study, 21 percent of UCLA engineering graduate students
couldn't define a patent; 32 percent couldn't define a copyright; 51 percent
couldn't define a trademark; and 68 percent- more than two-thirds

couldn't

define a trade secret. Never contemplating the possibility of espionage, American
professors sometimes comply with requests from acquaintances or strangers
overseas for research advice, manuscript reviews, or unpublished data.

University administrations largely ignore the growing threat, in part for financial
and reputational reasons. They're ramping up enrollment offull-paying
international students, and opening campuses abroad, which are often subsidized
by the host countries.

56

Like their institutions, individual professors may put global prestige ahead of
intellectual property. John Reece Roth, an emeritus professor of electrical
engineering at the University of Tennessee, was convicted in 2008 and sentenced
to four years in prison for using graduate students from China and Iran on U.S. Air
Force research that was off-limits to foreigners, and taking a laptop with restricted
files to China.

Roth wasn't a Chinese spy. He was simply proud of his renown there. He found it
hard to believe that a country where two universities had named him an honorary
professor, where his lectures drew large audiences, and where both volumes of his
book Industrial Plasma Engineering were available in translation, could have any
duplicitous intent.
A pivotal moment in educational globalization - and in the rise of academic spying
--was China's opening to the West, and its decision in 1978 to begin sending
students to the U.S, which was motivated largely by a desire to catch up in science
and technology. Soon afterwards, the FBI began noticing signs of an increase in
campus spying, such as a spike in the use of copying paper.

China now accounts for almost one-third of international students in the US, and

57
about 15% of foreign-born researchers and scientists. Again, the vast majority pose
no threat and, like other newcomers, infuse American universities with energy and
fresh perspectives. Still, a study conducted for my book found that at least 30
people born or raised in China and charged since 2000 in U.S. courts with
economic espionage, theft of trade secrets and similar offenses attended American
colleges or graduate schools, including Harvard, Stanford, Columbia, and Cornell.

The story of one Chinese graduate student at Duke University illustrates how
vulnerable academic research is to foreign raiders, and how little universities do to
protect it. I came across this saga when, through a public records request, I
obtained the agenda of an October 2012 meeting of the National Security Higher
Education Advisory Board, which was established in 2005 as a forum for
university presidents and US intelligence officials to discuss matters of mutual
importance. One agenda item stated that Duke University professor David Smith
"will discuss how, without his knowledge, a Chinese national targeted his lab and
published and exploited Dr. Smith's research to create a mirror institute in China.
The episode cost Duke significantly in licensing, patents, and royalties and kept
Smith from being the first to publish ground-breaking research."
I soon learned that Smith was a renowned researcher who had helped launch the
fast-growing field of meta-materials, or artificial materials with properties not

58
found in nature; that his lab had invented the first "invisibility cloak," though it
only concealed objects from microwaves, not the human eye; and that his lab had
Pentagon funding to develop ways of cloaking weapons. And I identified the
Chinese national as Ruopeng Liu, a former graduate student in Smith's lab.
Through interviews with Smith and other lab members, I discovered that Liu had
left a trail of suspicious behavior. He arranged for Chinese scientists to visit the
Duke lab and photograph its equipment, and passed them data and ideas developed
by unwitting colleagues at Duke. He deceived Smith into committing to work parttime in China by enlisting him under false pretenses to participate in a program
called Project 111, which the Chinese government established in 2006 to spur
"scientific" renewal of Chinese universities by recruiting famous scientists as
"overseas academic masters." And he secretly started a Chinese website based on
the work at Duke.

To be sure, it seems likely that Liu was poaching the research for his own benefit,
rather than for Chinese intelligence. Also, he didn't explicitly broke the rules,
mostly because there was no formal collaboration agreement and Duke's
guidelines didn't anticipate this sort of situation. Still, his actions smacked of
economic espionage.
After numerous warnings from other members of the lab, and questions from the

59
Pentagon, Smith finally began to suspect Liu, and took away his key to the lab, but
Duke still awarded Liu a doctorate. Coincidentally or not, a week after Liu' s
dissertation defense, Duke trustees approved negotiations with Chinese officials to
build a campus in the city of Kunshan, which would supply the land and facilities
for free. Once he had received his degree, Liu returned to China, where he used
Duke's research to start a competing institute and business with Chinese
government support, and became a billionaire.
In an interview for my book, Liu defended himself by noting that the invisibility
research was basic, not export-controlled or classified. "I worked in fundamental
research and published papers and they can be seen by anyone in the world," he
said.
Yet there are advantages even to stealing open research: namely, saving time and
avoiding mistakes. With a mole in a U.S. university laboratory, researchers
overseas can publish and patent an idea first, ahead of the true pioneers, and enjoy
the consequent acclaim, funding, and surge in interest from top students and
faculty. In fact, a foreign government may be eager to scoop up a fundamental
breakthrough before its applications become so important that it's labeled secretand foreign students lose access to it. One former FBI official whom I interviewed
had a term for such promising science: "pre-classified."

60
Liu "was definitely filled with intent," and his actions "could have tremendous
economic impact in the future," Prof. Smith told me. "I think if people understood
how something like this happens, and how those with potentially ill intent can take
advantage of the natural chaos that occurs in US academic environments, they
might become more aware and avoid things like this in the future."

Project Ill, for which Liu was a recruiter, is one of a vast array of Chinese "brain
gain" programs that, intentionally or not, encourage theft of intellectual property
from U.S. universities. Unlike Project 111, most of these initiatives target scientists
of Chinese descent. Unhappy with the high percentage of Chinese students at
Western universities who chose to stay abroad after earning their degrees, China's
national, provincial, and municipal government have embarked on aggressive
efforts to lure back the most successful expatriates.
Of the slew of initiatives, the best known are the Hundred Talents Program and the
Thousand Talents Program. Hundred Talents seeks up-and-coming scholars under
age forty. Thousand Talents, established in 2008 by the Communist Party's
powerful Organization Department, woos prominent professors of Chinese
ethnicity under age fifty-five. "The Chinese government has been the most
assertive government in the world in introducing policies targeted at triggering a
reverse brain drain," one study concluded in 2012.

61
These programs offer such generous salaries, laboratory facilities, research funds,
housing, medical care, jobs for spouses, top schools for children and other
incentives that a borderline candidate may be tempted to improve his chances by
bringing back somebody else's data or ideas. One former FBI agent summed up
the implicit message to Chinese researchers in the US this way: "Don't come home
empty-handed."
One such case involved a research assistant at Medical College of Wisconsin,
Huajun Zhao. In March 2013, he was arrested and charged with stealing three vials
of a cancer-fighting compound from his professor, Marshall Anderson, who had
patented it. Zhao, who claimed that he invented the compound and wanted to bring
it to China for further study, had applied for funding from Chinese agencies that
support overseas recruitment. One application was an "exact translation" of an old
grant proposal by Anderson. Zhao later pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of
illegally downloading research data.
While espionage services are active on university campuses, students and
professors may be even more vulnerable to recruitment or research theft
when they're off campus, participating in academic conferences. Intelligence
officers flock to conferences for the same reason that lawyers chase ambulances
and Army recruiters concentrate on low-income neighborhoods: they make the best
hunting grounds. As Willie Sutton famously said when asked why he robbed

62
banks, "Because that's where the money is." While a university campus may have
only one or two professors of interest to an intelligence service, the right
conference--on drone technology, perhaps, or ISIS- may have dozens.
The FBI warned American academics in 2011 to beware of conferences, citing this
scenario: "A researcher receives an unsolicited invitation to submit a paper for an
international conference. She submits a paper and it is accepted. At the conference,
the hosts ask for a copy of her presentation. The hosts hook a thumb drive to her
laptop, and unbeknownst to her, download every file and data source from her
computer."
Foreign countries target academic research with cyber as well as human espionage.
Last month, the U.S. Justice Department indicted nine Iranians affiliated with a
Tehran-based company called the Mabna Institute for hacking intol44 American
universities since 2013 to steal sensitive data and intellectual property on behalf of
the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which gathers intelligence for the Iranian
government. Using a technique known as "spear-phishing," they allegedly
compromised the accounts of 8,000 professors worldwide, and almost 3,800 in the
U.S., by sending them emails that appeared to come from colleagues at other
schools.

How should the US government, and universities, respond to the surge in
academic espionage? That's a hard question, and as an investigative

63
reporter, I'm far more proficient at exposing problems than at prescribing
solutions. But, because of the significant benefits of the globalization of
higher education, which I enumerated earlier, I don't believe in capping or
curtailing the influx of international students and professors.

Instead, I think universities should be smarter and more sophisticated
about the intelligence ramifications of research collaborations, student and
faculty exchanges, academic conferences, and international admissions. For
example, I'd like to see more training and courses in intellectual property
rights; contractual agreements for cross-border collaborations that spell out
each side's access to data and equipment; and orientation sessions for
conferences and study-abroad programs that include tips on recognizing
come-ons from intelligence agencies. And if students or alumni are exposed
as foreign spies, universities should deny or revoke their degrees, rather
than looking the other way.

Long overlooked, foreign espionage on campus is finally drawing attention.
China's "use of nontraditional collectors, especially in the academic setting,
whether it's professors, scientists, students, we see in almost every field office that
the FBI has around the country," FBI Director Christopher Wray testified to
Congress earlier this month. "It's not just in major cities, it's in small ones as well,

64
it's across basically very discipline. And I think the level of naivete on the part of
the academic sector about this creates its own issues. They're exploiting the very
open research and development environment that we have."

Academia ignores espionage at its peril. As long as American universities conduct
vital research, place alumni and faculty in the upper echelons of government and
business, and-perhaps most important-remain a bastion of access and
international culture in a fearful, locked-down world, they will attract attention
from intelligence services. Ultimately, unless they become more vigilant, spy
scandals could undermine their values, tarnish their reputations, and spur greater
scrutiny of their governance, admissions, and hiring.

As Americans, we're all concerned, and rightly so, about foreign intelligence
services interfering in our elections. Like democratic elections, a robust, open, and
intellectually curious system of higher education is a hallmark of our society. We
should take pains to protect it as well.

Summary of major points:

65
*The globalization of American higher education has many benefits, but
one worrisome side-effect is targeting of universities by foreign and
domestic intelligence agencies.
*Universities have paid little attention to this threat, and are ill-prepared
to deal vvith it. Collaborations with foreign researchers rarely have vvTitten
agreements regarding access to data and equipment, and courses on
intellectual property are rarely offered except in law schools.
* China is especially active in seeking research secrets at US universities. In
one case at Duke University, a Chinese graduate student used a variety of
strategies to poach Pentagon-funded research on ways of concealing
weapons. After returning to China, he started a competing institute and
company with Chinese government funding.
"'China's "brain gain" programs, which woos China-born scientists in the
US to return home, create potential incentives for research theft.
*American research is at risk not only on campus but also at academic
conferences, where foreign intelligence services may try to cultivate
professors or download data from their laptops.
* Foreign countries target American university research with cyber as well
as human espionage.

Daniel Golden is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and a senior editor
at ProPublica, a non-profit website for investigative reporting. His latest
book, Spy Schools: How The CIA, FBI, and Foreign Intelligence Secretly
Exploit America's Universities, was published by Henry Holt in October
2017. John Le Carre, the renowned spy novelist, has described it as "timely
and shocking." CBS has optioned it for a television series.
At ProPublica, Golden edited the 2017 series, "Lost Mothers,"
examining why the U.S. has the highest rate among affluent countries of
women dying in pregnancy and childbirth. This year, the series has won the
Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting and the George Polk Award in
Journalism.
Before joining ProPublica in October 2016, Golden was managing
editor for education and enterprise at Bloomberg News. There he edited a
series about tax inversions--companies moving headquarters overseas to
avoid taxes-- that earned Bloomberg's first-ever Pulitzer Prize in 2015. Golden
also won a Pulitzer as a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in 2004 for a
series of articles on preferences for children and donors in college
admissions. He expanded that series into a critically acclaimed national
bestseller, The Price of Admission: How America's Ruling Class Buys Its
Way Into Elite Colleges--and Who Gets Left Outside the Gates, which the
Washington Post selected as one of the best non-fiction books of 2006. It has
recently drawn renewed attention because of its disclosure that Jared
Kushner (now President Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser) was a less
than outstanding student who was admitted to Harvard after his father
pledged $2.5 million to the university. Golden is also a co-author of
"Affirmative Action for the Rich: Legacy Preferences in College Admissions"
(Century Foundation Press 2010).
Prior to The Wall Street Journal, Golden spent 18 years as a staff
reporter at the Boston Globe, including four years on its Spotlight team. He
has won numerous honors aside from the Pulitzer, including three George
Polk awards, three National Headliner awards, the Sigma Delta Chi award,
the New York Press Club Gold Keyboard award, and two Education Writers
Association Grand Prizes. Golden won a Gerald Loeb Award and was a
Pulitzer finalist in 2011 for a series of Bloomberg articles on for-profit colleges
that recruit soldiers, veterans, the homeless, and low-income students, often
to leave them with debt and no degree. He won an Overseas Press Club
award in 2012 for a magazine feature about a test-prep firm in China that
cracked the code of the SAT.

Golden joined Bloomberg News in 2009 from Conde Nast Portfolio,
where he was senior editor for investigations. His Portfolio cover story, "Some
Friend," revealing that Countrywide chief executive Angelo Mozilo provided
favorable mortgages to notables including members of Congress and former
Cabinet members, prompted a U.S. Senate Ethics Committee investigation. A
1978 Harvard graduate, Golden lives in Belmont, Mass.

Chairman ABRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. Golden.
Mr. Hassold, five minutes, sir.
TESTIMONY OF MR. CRANE HASSOLD,
DIRECTOR OF THREAT INTELLIGENCE, PHISHLABS

Mr. HASSOLD. Thank you. Chairs Abraham and Comstock, Ranking Members Beyer and Lipinski, and Members of the Committee,
thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today. My
name’s Crane Hassold, and I’m the Director of Threat Intelligence
at PhishLabs, a cybersecurity company based in Charleston, South
Carolina. The purpose of my testimony today is to discuss my research and observations on the threat foreign actors pose to American academic institutions through the theft of research as a result
of cyber attacks.
For background on who PhishLabs is and what we do, we were
founded in 2008, and one of our primary missions is to identify, understand, and mitigate cyber attacks where the primary attack vector is phishing. In 2017, we analyzed more than 1.3 million confirmed phishing sites and shut down more than 12,000 phishing attacks each month.
For more than 90 percent of targeted cyber attacks, the initial
attack vector is phishing. Phishing is effective because it takes advantage of emotional responses that are inherent to human behavior such as fear, anxiety, and curiosity. Through phishing, threat
actors can compromise personal and financial information, steal
data or intellectual property, and extort victims for financial gain.
Relevant to today’s discussion, universities are particularly susceptible to risks associated with phishing attacks due to the sheer
volume of users that interact with our network. In December 2017,
I identified a series of malicious domains hosting phishing sites,
targeting various universities in the United States and other countries. Unlike most other university phishing sites, these were
uniquely crafted to mimic the login pages of university libraries.
Using a combination of technical analysis and open-source research, I identified hundreds of other phishing sites linked to the
same threat actors that had targeted other universities around the
world. To date, I’ve identified nearly 800 distinct phishing attacks
linked to this group, which we refer to by the name Silent Librarian dating back to September 2013. These attacks, which are significantly more sophisticated than most phishing attacks I’ve seen,
have targeted 300 different universities in 23 countries, including
174 institutions in the United States. It is clear the universities
targeted by this group are not randomly selected. Targets in these
phishing campaigns are generally prominent research technical or
medical universities.
In addition to universities, I also observed other notable nonacademic American institutions targeted by the group such as Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Electric Power Research Institute,
and multiple major medical centers. Based on my research, the
purpose of these attacks is to compromise university credentials
and use those credentials to access and exfiltrate data from university resources such as academic research databases.
I also identified one Iranian website that was used to monetize
the stolen credentials, which has been in operation since at least

69
2015 and, based on data shown from the site, has been visited
more than 1 million times.
Since the beginning of my research into this group and their attacks, I have worked closely with the FBI to provide intelligence
into the group’s tactics and motivations. I have also partnered with
REN–ISAC, an information-sharing clearinghouse for higher education institutions to notify targeted universities of imminent or recent phishing campaigns.
As referenced by a few members already, on March 23, 2018, the
Department of Justice indicted nine Iranians associated with a
company named the Mabna Institute. According to the indictment,
this group allegedly conducted phishing attacks against more than
100,000 targets at international universities and private sector
companies to steal more than 31 terabytes of academic data and intellectual property. The cost spent by American universities to procure resources compromised by the group is reportedly in excess of
$3 billion.
The DOJ also alleges in the indictment that much of this malicious activity was conducted at the direction of the IRGC, one of
the Government of Iran’s primary intelligence collection entities.
Based on the evidence detailed in the indictment, it is likely that
the Mabna Institute and Silent Librarian and are the same group.
It is also important to note that the indictment has not seemed
to deter the group from continuing their malicious activities. As of
the date of this testimony, I’ve observed 27 new phishing sites created by the group since the indictment targeting 20 different universities, 10 of which are located in the United States.
Based on my analysis of these attacks and conversations I’ve had
with members of the university security community, there are a
range of ways academic institutions can better prepare and respond to the cyber threats posed by malicious threat actors. Universities should accept credential phishing as a significant threat
and focus on identifying ways to better protect their users against
them.
Users—universities should place more of a focus on fully mitigating phishing sites targeting their users rather than implementing quick responses like simply blocking access to malicious
websites on an internal network that still leave open the opportunity for further compromise. And, like other institutions, universities should also invest more in security training that raises the
awareness of students and faculty to potential cyber threats.
Thank you again for the opportunity to testify before you today,
and I look forward to answering any questions.

Testimony of
Crane Hassold
Director of Threat Intelligence
PhishLabs

Before the
U.S. House of Representatives
Committee on Science, Space, and Technology
Subcommittee on Oversight
and
Subcommittee on Research and Technology

"Scholars or Spies: Foreign Plots Targeting America's Research and Development"

Aprilll, 2018

Chairman Abraham, Chairwoman Comstock, Ranking Members Beyer and Lipinski, and
Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today. My name
is Crane Hassold, and I am the Director of Threat Intelligence at PhishLabs, a cybersecurity
company based in Charleston, South Carolina. The purpose of my testimony is to discuss my
research and observations on the threat foreign actors pose to American academic institutions
through the theft of research.

An Overview of PhishLabs
PhishLabs was founded in 2008 and is a 24/7 managed security provider that protects against
phishing attacks targeting employees and customers. Using a powerful combination of
proprietary technology, specialized security operations, and deep threat intelligence, PhishLabs
provides a full range of services to detect these attacks, extract intelligence on the attack

1

71
operations, and quickly mitigate the underlying infrastructure to stop the threat. This results in a
reduction of risk posed by compromised systems, data breaches, and online fraud.
The vast majority of cyberattacks start by targeting and exploiting people. This is because every
organization has people and, unlike technology, people cannot be patched to remove their
vulnerability. To further understand the extent in which PhishLabs analyzes phishing related
cyber threats, please consider the following over the past year:
We analyzed more than 1.3 million confirmed malicious phishing sites that resided on
nearly 300,000 unique domains.
We investigated and mitigated more than 12,000 phishing attacks every month, and
identified the underlying infrastructure used in these attacks and shut them down.
We work on behalf ofleading financial institutions, social media sites, healthcare
companies, retailers, insurance companies, and technology companies to fight back
against phishing threats.

Why Phishing is a Persistent Problem
Exploiting human vulnerabilities continues to be the most successful path for threat actors
targeting the assets of organizations and individuals. As organizations deploy more advanced
technical security controls, cybercriminals will increasingly rely on a vulnerability that is more
difficult to patch the human. Phishing emails are effective because they capitalize on emotional
responses offered by the human psyche. Additionally, modem phishing is far more sophisticated
than it used to be. The attacks themselves so closely min·or the legitimate emails that even savvy
Internet users fall victim. Threat actors are supported by a thriving cybcrcrime ecosystem of
tools and services, enabling them to launch phishing attacks with ease and impunity. As a result,
according to the 2017 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report 1, almost half of all data
breaches are caused by a phishing attack.
Even though the methods and techniques evolve, phishing will persist as long as it is effective
for cybercriminals. According to the Anti Phishing Working Group (APWG), annual phishing
volume continues to risc 2 Over the years phishing has been deployed as the initial infection
vector for ransomware, banking trojans, and other malware. It has been used in Business Email
Compromise (BEC) campaigns which arc targeted email attacks that most often do not contain
malicious attachments, links, or exploits. BEC attacks rely heavily on social engineering
teclmiques and generally single out individuals that have authority, system rights, or access to

send funds. Nation state attacks also leverage phishing in Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) to
penetrate enterprise networks and gain a foothold from which they can move laterally and
establish persistence through stolen credentials and Remote Access Trojans (RATs). Phishing
has proven successful for a variety of nefarious motives.
Through phishing, threat actors can steal data or intellectual property, access corporate systems,
and/or commit fraud against individuals and organizations. Universities are particularly
susceptible to risks associated with phishing attacks due to the sheer volume of users that interact
with the network. Additionally, higher education has not traditionally invested heavily in
mitigation of threats posed by phishing. As long as cybercriminals are accessing what is desired,
threats will continue.

Silent Librarian: A Persistent Iranian Cyber Threat to American Universities
In December 2017, I identified two separate malicious domains hosting a total of nearly two
dozen phishing sites targeting various universities in the United States and other countries.
Generally, phishing sites targeting universities are presented as replicas of the university's
general login page. The phishing sites hosted on these two domains, however, were different.
Instead of being crafted to target general university credentials, these phishing sites were
specifically crafted to mimic the login pages of university libraries. This unique difference
indicated to me that the motivation of these phishing sites was significantly different that other
university-themed phishing attacks I had previously observed and caused me to begin conducting
additional research to better understand the purpose, scope, and characteristics of this threat.
Using a combination of technical analysis and open source research, I quickly identified
hundreds of other phishing sites linked to the same threat actors that had previously targeted
other universities around the world. Based on the clear threat posed by the threat actors
responsible for these attacks, I named the group, which is customary for significant threat groups
in the cyber threat intelligence field, Silent Librarian. To date, I have identified nearly 800
distinct phishing attacks linked to this group dating back to September 2013. These attacks have
targeted more than 300 different universities in 23 countries, including 174 institutions in the
United States.
Reviewing the list of targets, it is clear that they are not randomly selected. Universities targeted
in Silent Librarian phishing campaigns are generally prominent research, technical, or medical
universities. Some schools, in particular, have been targeted numerous times over the past fourand-a-half years. For example, Monash University, located in Australia, has been a popular
Silent Librarian target. Monash has been targeted more than two dozen times by the group since
the beginning of2017. In addition to universities, this group has targeted notable non-academic

3

73
institutions, such as Los Alamos National Laboratory, Electric Power Research Institute,
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Ohio State Wexner Medical Center, and Thomson
Reuters.
Since the beginning of my research into this group and their attacks, I have worked closely with
the Federal Bureau oflnvestigation to provide intelligence into the group's tactics and
motivations. I have also partnered with the Research and Education Networking Information
Sharing and Analysis Center (REN-ISAC), an information sharing clearinghouse for higher
education institutions, to notify targeted universities of imminent or recent phishing campaigns.

Characteristics of Silent Librarian Phishing Attacks
Phishing attacks I have observed linked to Silent Librarian are incredibly sophisticated. Like a
significant majority of most phishing attacks, email is the primary attack vector used by the
group and the lures used to trick victims are remarkably authentic in appearance. Spelling and
grammar, two of the primary indicators of a malicious email, are nearly perfect. The message in
the lures is contextually legitimate, meaning it is an email a recipient could be reasonably
expected to receive. Most Silent Librarian lure emails contain spoofed sender email addresses,
which make them appear as if they're coming from a legitimate source. Some of the phishing
emails, though, have been sent from temporary Gmail addresses. A small number of lures have
even been sent from what appear to be email accounts at various Turkish universities.
Each of the Silent Librarian lures ends with a very realistic looking closing signature containing
contact infonnation for the target library. The information used to construct these signatures was
likely collected through open source research conducted by the group. In some cases, all of the
contact information can be found together on one wcbpage; however, some of the information is
in different locations, indicating the actors have likely performed manual reconnaissance to
gather the information.
At least a third of the Silent Librarian lures identified use fictitious personas to add a sense of
authenticity to the em ails. The names of these personas have evolved over time; however, the
group has used the personas "Sarah Miller" and "Susan Jackson" frequently in recent campaigns.
The group also changes the names of the personas to match the location of the target university.
For example, a recent campaign targeting an Australian university used the persona "Jonathon
Dixon," while the persona identity "Shinsuke Hamada" was previously used in an email lure
targeting a J apancse schooL
One of the most notable aspects of lures used in Silent Librarian phishing campaigns is that the
group's tactics have only minimally changed over time. Outside the correction of a few minor
spelling errors, the content of the phishing lures has remained incredibly consistent. The likely

4

74
reason for this consistency is that the success rate of campaigns using these lures was high
enough that there was no need for them to evolve.
Like their lures, phishing sites created by Silent Librarian are very realistic. The URLs associated
with the phishing pages closely mirror the legitimate web addresses of the account login pages
for the target university libraries. Similarly, the content of Silent Librarian phishing pages is
almost identical to the legitimate target sites. To create such a realistic phishing page, members
of the group likely scrape the original HTML source code from the legitimate library login page,
then edit the references to resources used to render the webpage (images, JavaScript, CSS, etc.)
to point back to the original page, a common tactic among phishers.
At the beginning of 2017, the group began to obtain free SSL certificates for their phishing
pages. This emerging tactic 3 exploits the general public's misunderstanding of the HTTP Secure
(HTTPS) protocol to create more realistic-looking phishing pages. While HTTPS only indicates
secure communication to and from a website, poor security messaging and confusing browser
indicators have led many web users to believe that HTTPS also means that a website is safe
and/or legitimate 4
As a result of my research, I identified a website, Uniaccount[.]ir, that was used to sell at least
some of the credentials compromised in Silent Librarian phishing attacks. On the Uniaccount
website, visitors can purchase account credentials for dozens of universities around the world.
Memberships are offered for access to variety of academic research databases and bulk access to
the "best universities." Visitors to this site can also buy individual journal articles, ebooks, and
standards documents for a nominal price. This website has been in operation since at least early2015 and, based on data shown on the site, there have been more than one million visitors to the
page.

Indictment of the Mabna Institute
On March 23, 2018, the US Department of Justice (USDOJ) indicted nine Iranians associated
with a company named the Mabna Institute 5 According to the indictment, this group allegedly
conducted phishing attacks against international universities and private-sector companies to
steal academic data, intellectual property, and other propriety data. The indictment details how
more than l 00,000 accounts of professors had been targeted through the end of 2017. Nearly
8,000 professor accounts were successfully compromised, which were used to exfiltratc a
massive amount of academic data, including journals, theses, dissertations, and electronic books.

islamic

75
In total, more than 31 terabytes of data was stolen. The USDOJ alleges that much of this
malicious activity was conducted on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC),
one of the government of Iran's primary intelligence collection entities.
Based on my analysis of the details of the malicious activity outlined in the indictment, it is
likely that the Mabna Institute and Silent Librarian are the same group. In addition to sharing
strikingly similar attack techniques, an in-depth analysis of the Uniaccount website detailed
above indicates that it is likely administered by Mostafa Sadeghi, who was named in the
indictment as a "prolific Iran-based computer hacker who was an affiliate of the Mabna
Institute."
It is important to note that the indictment has not seemed to deter the group from continuing their

malicious activity. As of this date of this testimony, I have observed 27 new phishing sites
created by the group since the indictment, targeting 20 different universities, ten of which are
located in the United States.

The Impact of Phishing to American Universities
For non-financial institutions, measuring the impact ofphishing can be difficult. Instead of being
able to easily observe a financial loss caused by direct monetary theft, the impacts to these types
of targets are more indirect. Much of the financial impact ofphishing attacks incurred by nonfinancial institutions is related to the costs associated with responding to and mitigating attacks,
which includes customer support resources, remediation efforts, impact analysis, and legal fees.
In addition, phishing attacks are a significant threat to personal information, which can be used
to facilitate additional crimes, such as identity theft and tax fraud.
As evidenced by the threat caused by the Silent Librarian campaigns, the impacts to academic
institution caused by phishing attacks are even more complex. According to the USDOJ, the cost
spent by American universities to procure and access the data and intellectual data compromised
by the group was in excess of three billion dollars. Additionally, due to the massive amount of
information sometimes exfiltrated from academic journal databases, access to these resources
were cut off to the entire university.

Recommendations and Solutions
Based on my analysis of these attacks and conversations I have had with members of the
university secmity community, there are a range of ways academic institutions can better prc"Pare
and respond to cyber threats posed by malicious threat actors. These solutions include accepting
the threat of credential phishing attacks, improving efforts to detect and mitigate phishing
infrastructure, and increasing awareness of cyber threats through security training.

6

76
1. Acknowledge the Threat and Impact
Generally, when people think of threats posed by cyber threat actors, particularly from foreign
nation-state actors, they think of sophisticated malware-based attacks. Credential phishing
attacks are viewed as nuisances that pose little to no risk to an organization. In most
organizations, a significant amount of time and money is used to protect users from malicious
payload-based attacks, less effort is placed on detecting and analyzing less technical threats, like
credential phishing.
While my testimony today demonstrates the significant impact credential phishing attacks can
have on the academic community, these types of attacks have become more common across all
industries. In 2017, the number of credential phishing attacks posing as email login pages
increased dramatically, overtaking financial phishing attacks as the most popular targets for
cybercriminals 6 . This increase was almost entirely driven by the sharp rise in the number of
phishing attacks mimicking Microsoft Office365 pages. This shift in targeting clearly signifies
that cyber threat actors view credential phishing attacks as lucrative and meeting their goals.
Because these types of attacks are becoming a more popular fonn of attack and have been proven
to be successful in previous campaigns targeting academic institutions, universities must accept
them as a significant threat and focus on identifying ways to better protect their users against
them.

2. Increase the Focus on Disntpting Phishing Infrastructure
Based on conversations I have had with colleagues in the academic community, it is my
understanding that most universities respond to phishing attacks by simply blocking access to
malicious websites on their internal network. While this response can be implemented quickly,
this approach does not dismpt the attack and can still lead students and faculty to be
compromised.
First, this response tactic assumes that all potential victims arc located on the university's
network at all times. Unfortunately, due to the transient nature of electronic communication and
use of mobile devices to access user email accounts, the probability that a malicious phishing
email is received by a student or faculty member outside of the university's internal network is
significant.

7

77
Second, this approach does nothing to disrupt the infrastructure of a phishing attack. At
PhishLabs, one of our core services is identifying phishing sites and taking them offline through
our partnerships with hosting providers. We focus on shutting down every step in the phishing
attack chain to ensure that potential victims are unable to access the malicious content. As
mentioned above, when not on the university's network, students and faculty lose the protection
afforded from simply blocking a phishing sit internally. This exposes them to compromise
because they would be able to still visit a phishing site in the absence of fully mitigating the
malicious infrastructure.
Based the examples outlined above, universities should place more of a focus on fully mitigating
phishing sites targeting their users rather than implementing quick responses that still leave open
the opportunity for account compromise.

3. Reduce Risk Profile Through Training and Mitigation
Fighting back against phishing attacks starts with education. General security awareness training
that educates users on a broad range of risks is the first step in building a security vigilant
culture. In our experience, traditional, once-a-year training is not the most effective method.
Users must be engaged through interactive, frequent training that educates and tests users.
Secondly, due to the substantial risk presented by phishing, users must be conditioned to
recognize and report malicious emails.
To condition users phishing simulations that reflect real-world threats should be conducted on a
frequent basis. Immediate training should be administered if users take action as part of phishing
simulation, such as, clicking a link in an email or downloading an attachment. On the spot
training must be short, memorable, and relevant.
University networks can be exposed not only by faculty and staff but also students. As ideal as it
would be to train everyone, it is more realistic to consider training faculty and staff at a
minimum. As a result, employee reports of suspicious emails would enable faster detection of
phishing attacks that make it past security controls and into user inboxes. This process however,
requires consistent and timely analysis of user-reported emails. Once the emails arc reported.
threat indicators must be fed into the existing security infrastructure to mitigate the risk. This
action would significantly decrease the chance of others, that may not be trained, exposing the
network to threat actors. An effective program can transform people from being the most
exploited vulnerability to a security asset.
Thank you again for the opportunity to testify before you today and I would be pleased to answer
any questions.

Silent Librarian: More to the Story of the
Iranian Mabna Institute Indictment

Last Friday, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced the indictment of nine
Iranians who worked for an organization named the Mabna Institute. According to
prosecutors, the defendants stole more than 31 terabytes of data from universities,
companies, and government agencies around the world. The cost to the universities alone
reportedly amounted to approximately $3.4 billion. The information stolen from these
universities was used by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) or sold for profit inside
Iran.

Ph ish Labs has been tracking this same threat group since late-2017, designating them Silent
Librarian. Since discovery, we have been working with the FBI, I SAC partners, and other
international law enforcement agencies to help understand and mitigate these attacks.
The details of the phishing attacks identified by Ph ish labs give a broader sense of the overall
threat posed by this group when read alongside the crimes outlined in the indictment. While
the indictment details the finely-crafted spear phishing campaigns targeting university
professors, the attacks tracked by Phishlabs also involved the general targeting of university
students and faculty to collect credentials for the victims' university library accounts. In light
of the news from Friday, we are sharing insights and research that provide additional context
to the Mabna Institute indictment.

80

History and Targets
Ph ish labs began compiling attacks, lures, and other information tied to Silent Librarian in
December 2017. Starting with just two domains that hosted nearly two dozen university
phishing sites, we used PassiveDNS analysis, Who is data, SSL certificate monitoring, and
open source research to identify more phishing sites linked to the same group. To date, we
have identified more than 750 phishing attacks attributed to Silent Librarian dating back to
September 2013. These attacks have targeted more than 300 universities in 22
countries. While most of the targeted universities are located in the United States, Canada,
United Kingdom, and Australia, there have also been schools targeted in other countries in
Western Europe and Asia.

Countries targeted by Silent Librarian phishing attacks.

81
Looking at the list of university targets, it is clear that they are not randomly selected. All of
the universities targeted in the Silent Librarian campaigns are generally prominent research,
technical, or medical universities. Some schools in particular have been targeted numerous
times over the past four-and-a-half years. For example, Monash University, located in
Australia, has been a popular Silent Librarian target. The university has been targeted more
than two dozen times by the group since the beginning of 2017. In addition to universities,
Silent Librarian has also targeted non-academic institutions, such as Los Alamos National
Laboratory, Electric Power Research Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Ohio
State Wexner Medical Center, and Thomson Reuters.

Silent Librarian Lures
One of the notable aspects of Silent Librarian phishing campaigns is that their tactics have
barely changed over time. Outside the correction of a few minor spelling errors, the content
of the phishing lures has remained incredibly consistent. The likely reason for this
consistency is that the success rate of campaigns using these lures was high enough that
there was no need for them to evolve. From a research perspective, though, the static nature
of the group's lure made it easier for us to identify past campaigns and track new campaigns
as they occurred.

Overall, the lures constructed by Silent Librarian are remarkably authentic-looking, Spelling
and grammar, two of the primary indicators of a malicious email, are nearly perfect The
message in the lures are contextually legitimate, meaning it is an email a recipient could be
reasonably expected to receive.
Most of the Silent Librarian lure em ails contain spoofed sender email addresses, which make
them appear as if they're coming from a legitimate source. Some of the phishing em ails,
though, have been sent from temporary Gmail addresses. A small number of lures have even
been sent from what appear to be email accounts at various Turkish universities.

83

Example lure sent from a temporary Gmail account.

Each of the Silent Librarian lures ends with a very realistic looking closing signature
containing contact information for the target library. This information is collected through
open source research conducted by the threat actors. In some cases, all of the contact
information can be found together on one webpage; however, some of the information is in
different locations, indicating the actors are likely performing manual reconnaissance to
gather the information.
At least a third of the Sitent Librarian lures identified use fictitious personas to add a sense of
authenticity to the em aits. The names of these personas have evolved over time; however,
the group has used the personas "Sarah Miller" and "Susan Jackson" frequently in recent
campaigns. The group also changes the names of the personas to match the location of the
target university. For example, a recent campaign targeting an Australian university used the

84
persona "Jonathon Dixon," while the persona identity "Shinsuke Hamada" was previously
used in an email lure targeting a Japanese school.

Like the overall content of their lures, the subject lines of Silent Librarian phishing em ails
have remained consistent over time. Since the beginning of 2017, 97 percent of lures
contained the subject "Library Account," "Library Notifications," or "Library Services."

85
Sometimes the name of the target university has been appended to the subject to add more
perceived authenticity to the attack vector.

Phishing Pages
We have identified 127 different domains used to host Silent Librarian phishing sites since
2013. Like a growing number of phishing sites, domains registered by Silent Librarian
generally use Freenom top-level domains (TLDs) (.TK,. CF, .GA, .GQ, .ML) because they are
available at no cost. The group has used domains on otherTLDs, though rather sparingly.
Some of the other recent TLDs associated with Silent Librarian domains include .IN, .IR,
.INFO, .LINK, and .TOP.
Like their lures, the phishing sites crafted by Silent Librarian are very realistic. The URLs
associated with the phishing pages closely mirror the full legitimate URL path of the account
login page for the target university library.

The content of Silent Librarian phishing pages is almost identical to the legitimate target
sites. The actors likely scrape the original HTML source code from the legitimate library login
page, then edit the references to resources used to render the web page (images, Java Script,
CSS, etc.) to point back to the original page, a common tactic among phishers.

Side-by-side comparison of a legitimate login page (left) and a phishing page (right).

At the beginning of 2017, Silent Librarian began to regularly obtain free Let's Encrypt SSL
certificates for their phishing pages. This technique, which we have previous discussed at
length in blog posts from November and December, is used to create more realistic-looking
phishing pages.

Example phishing page with valid SSL certificate.

For a few of the Silent Librarian attacks, we identified and collected the ph ish kits that were
used to construct the phishing sites and left on the malicious server. Ph ish kits contain all of
the files necessary to stand up a phishing site quickly, such as HTML files, PHP mailing scripts,

87
and other resources (image files, JavaScript, CSS, etc.). Because these kits are essentially the
"recipe" of how a phishing site is created, they can provide valuable intelligence into the
back-end functionality of the site. One of the best pieces of evidence that can be collected
from a phish kit is the PHP mailing script, which contains the location where compromised
information is sent, usually an email address. An analysis of the Silent Librarian kits identified
two email accounts that were used to receive compromised victim credentials. One was a
Gmail email address and the other was an email address with Vatanmail, an Iranian email
service provider.

88
What Happens to the Stolen Credentials?
As outlined in Friday's indictment, in addition to being passed to the IRGC, some of the stolen
credentials were also sold on two Iranian websites, Megapaper[.]ir and Gigapaper[.]ir.
Similarly, the credentials stolen in the Silent Librarian phishing attacks we identified were
sold on an Iranian website; however, it is not one of the sites specified in the indictment.
Using a combination of technical and open source research, we identified another website,
Uniaccount[.]ir, that was used to sell the credentials compromised in the Silent Librarian
phishing attacks. The Uniaccount website is likely run by Mostafa Sadeghi, who was named in
the recent indictment as a "prolific Iran-based computer hacker who was an affiliate of the
Mabna Institute."

On the Uniaccount website, credentials are offered for dozens of universities around the
world. Visitors are asked to send an email to a specified Gmail address to request the price of
a password for a specific university. Notably, the website also mentions that all accounts that
are purchased have a one-month warranty, so if the account is cut off during that period, the
purchaser will be given a new account to use.

In addition to buying an account for a specific university, a visitor on Uniaccount can also
simply purchase research journal articles individually. The cost of a single article on
Uniaccount is 2,000 Tomans, or approximately 60 U.S. cents. Ebooks and standards
documents are also advertised for sale on the site.

to a variety of academic journals and five articles from "rare journals" for a two-month
period. A second "golden" membership is available for 50,000 Tomans (approximately 15
USD), which provides access to passwords to the "best universities" and 15 articles from rare
journals also for a two-month period.
Ph ish labs continues to collaborate with universities, law enforcement, and ISAC partners as
we discover more information about this group.

How Universities Should Respond to
Iranian Hacking Charges
Posted by Crane Hassold, Director of Threat Intelligence on Mar 29, '18
Find me on:
Linked in Twitter

Last week, news broke that an Iranian hacker network, Mabna Institute, had
been systematically stealing data from unive1·sities
across the US and abroad.
It's unclear precisely how much data has been
compromised, but it has been estimated to have cost US
universities around $3.4 billion dollars to collect and
maintain.
While the administration has announced sanctions and
criminal indictments against the group, it's highly
unlikely any of the actors involved will receive punishment
So if you happen to work for a university, or be responsible in some capacity for the data
security of a university, you'd be forgiven for wondering" .. .What now?"
To answer that question, it's important to understand how these hackers have been
operating.

Phishing ... Again
Here's the thing about data theft The absolute easiest way to steal sensitive data is to
compromise one or more privileged accounts, take control of them, and exfiltrate data at
your convenience.

92
And how do you compromise an account? Simple: You use targeted spear phishing
campaigns, backed by phishing sites designed to trick victims into entering their credentials
into what looks like a legitimate login form.
That's it.
There are other ways to do it, but this process is by far the simplest and most effective. As a
result, hacking groups fall back on spear phishing time and time again for credential theft
and account takeover.
In this case, Phishlabs analysts identified over 750 phishing attacks attributed to the group.
For the most part, the attacks were aimed at professors and other faculty members, though
in some cases students were also targeted. The campaign, which was reported to the FBI by
Phishlabs back in late 2017, has been dubbed the Silent Librarian.

93

~riih

-Uilh~r~lty ttbr,lty

The most notable thing about them was that they were incredibly realistic-looking. Their
spelling and grammar was perfect. They were thematically relevant, naming the university in

the lure.

94
So ... What Now?
So what actions can you take to mitigate the threat of phishing? The first thought you might
have is to invest in technical security controls; however, sadly that just won't cut it.
Spam and content filters, firewalls, and other technologies that rely on blocking incoming
attacks will never provide complete defense against phishing attacks. Why? Because these
technologies rely on a constantly updated set of rules, meaning malicious content will only
be blocked if it contains an indicator such as an IP address, hash, or language pattern which
has previously been identified as malicious. And regardless of the technology available,
humans will continue to be the weakest link.
Unfortunately, spear phishing attacks are highly likely to evade these types of controls for a
variety of reasons:
By definition they are custom-written for each campaign, making them unlikely to be flagged as
containing suspicious content
2. New phishing sites are often setup for each campaign, so the URLs and IP addresses used won't yet be
known as malicious
3. Credential theft campaigns rarely utilize malware, so in most cases there is no malicious hash present
to identify

1.

All of this adds up to one certainty: Your users will be targeted by phishing attacks, and some
of those attacks, the most dangerous ones, will reach their in boxes. And since we have
compelling evidence that universities are being targeted by foreign state actors, you need to
start taking action right away.

Two Steps You Can Take Now to Mitigate the Threat of Spear Phishing
In order to truly tackle the threat of spear phishing (or any phishing, forth at matter) a
dedicated, consistent training program is essential. We've written about how exactly you can
do this a bunch of times, so check out this post for an introduction.
At the same time, though, there are some things you can do right now to mitigate the threat
of spear phishing attacks:

1) Issue guidance to faculty and students

95
Most people don't think about phishing on a daily basis, and have very tittle chance of
identifying a sophisticated spear phishing attack based exclusively on its content. Thankfully,
though, there is one other way to spot malicious em ails designed to steal credentials: Links.
Credential theft campaigns rely on victims following embedded links, which take them to
convincing copies of the legitimate login pages they are expecting. To combat this, advise all
faculty and students to manually type in website URLs instead of following links in em ails.
That way, instead of being directed to a phishing site, they'll safely navigate to secure,
legitimate sites.

2) Request that suspicious emails be reported to your security team
Again, we've written about this dozens oftimes; reported phishing emails are a thousand
times better than deleted phishing em ails. It's advised that you set up a phishing-specific
in box, and ask faculty members and students to forward any em ails they receive that seem
suspicious, or which ask them to follow embedded links to enter their login credentials.
These reported em ails can serve as an early warning mechanism, enabling you to get ahead
of an incoming attack before it gets out of hand

Silent Librarian University Attacks
Continue Unabated in Days Following
Indictment
Posted by Crane Hassold, Director of Threat Intelligence on Apr 5, '18
Find me on:
Linked In Twitter

On Friday, March 23, nine Iranian threat actors were
indicted for stealing massive quantities of data from
universities, businesses, and governments all over the
world.
If you've been following our blog (orthe news), you already
know the actors are associated with an organization called
the Mabna Institute, and are responsible for stealing more than 31 terabytes of data over the
past four and a half years. To put that number in context, you'd need to cut down more
than 1.5 million trees to make enough paper to print out all of the stolen data.
The group, which we have called "Silent Librarian," has targeted universities and other
organizations with strong research departments, particularly those focused on medicine and
technology.
But the scale of the attacks, while alarming, isn't the most concerning thing right now. Here's
the real headline: Silent Librarian phishing attacks have continued unabated in the days since

the indictment.
Since the indictment less than 14 days ago, Phishlabs analysts have observed 18 new
phishing attacks targeting 14 different universities from five countries: United States, United
Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and France.

97
What Does This Mean for Potential Targets?
Over the past two weeks, the indicted Iranian threat actors have continued their attacks
despite being formally charged. Including the most recent attacks, Phishlabs has attributed
more than 780 phishing attacks to Silent Librarian, which includes attacks against more than
300 universities in 22 countries.
While extradition or real sanctions were likely never in the cards, it was probably hoped that
publicly "naming and shaming" the actors would at least put the attacks on hold. Since that
hasn't happened, it's doubly important that potential targets do everything they can to
protect themselves from further attacks.
To reiterate, the attackers have explicitly gone after universities and other organizations with
strong research departments, particularly in the fields of technology and medicine.
Below is a list of high-level indicators of compromise (IOCs) that we have previously
associated with Silent Librarian phishing attacks, which includes domains hosting university
phishing sites and IP addresses linked to those domains. It should be noted that all of the
domains used by Silent Librarian are maliciously registered and no legitimate content has
been observed on any of the domains. For IP addresses referenced below, other non-Silent
Librarian domains have historically resolved to many of them and the maliciousness of those
domains has not been determined.
While stringent anti-phishing measures should be taken to minimize the threat posed by
Silent Librarian (or any threat, for that matter), the first order of business for any potential
target organization should be to blacklist the domains and monitor and/or set flags for
outbound traffic for the IP addresses listed below. It should also be noted that because this
group is still deploying new attacks, new domains are being actively created, so this should
be viewed as a historical list, not a real-time list.

Chairman ABRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. Hassold.
I thank all the witnesses for their testimony. I’m going to recognize myself for five minutes for questioning.
Mr. Wessel, Ms. Van Cleave, and Mr. Hassold, I think these
questions will go to you. Is it fair to say that the open and collaborative nature of U.S. academic institutions make them inherently
vulnerable to the threat of foreign exfiltration? And if so, how do
we strike that balance in protecting our research and our systems
while ensuring collaboration? Mr. Wessel, I’ll start with you.
Mr. WESSEL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think, as I pointed out
in my testimony, we can identify what some of the high-value targets are and focus on those first so that we can look at critical
areas of research that relate not only to the economic domain but
China’s national security desires, other countries’ national security
desires. One can do a gap analysis to determine whether, for example, China needs hot engine technology to be able to develop jet engines for their fighters.
We can then net back and look at some of those cooperative research programs, the labs here in the United States that are doing
work with cleared defense contractors or doing it on their own and
try and upscale what the systems in place are to ensure that our
systems are secure, to assess foreign students who are part of those
labs, and make sure we’re doing better analysis of their visas and
the connections they have, and to try and track where the information may or may not be going. So it’s threat analysis and using that
to try and identify gaps and go forward. We also have a lot more
to do beyond that.
Chairman ABRAHAM. Ms. Van Cleave?
Ms. VAN CLEAVE. Mr. Chairman, clearly, the academic community, as you describe it, is open and free, and value the free exchange of ideas and interaction of all peoples and that’s the way
to advance our knowledge and understanding. Academia is very
rich. It is very rich in creative people, it is very rich in people who
are going to have significant relationships with other creative people throughout the country. And so from the standpoint of a foreign
intelligence service, here’s an opportunity to do the basics of espionage. It is the opportunity to spot potential sources, to evaluate
those sources, to find people who know other people that can introduce them to significant potential sources. So for an espionage
service, is academia a great place to operate? Absolutely, it’s a
great place to operate.
My point—my principal point to you is to say, look, yes, we need
to have awareness. And awareness is significantly important, and
the more that all Americans can understand the extent to which
they don’t want to be taken advantage of by foreign actors, that is
excellent. But we have more to do as a government as well. It is
clear to me that the advantage lies in being able to see inside of
what the foreign intelligence service is after in the first place. If
we know who their people are and where they are and how they’re
operating and we know they’re at this university but not that university, we have the advantage to protect ourselves and to disrupt
what they’re doing much more effectively than if all of our eggs are
in the defense basket.
Chairman ABRAHAM. Mr. Hassold, your take?

105
Mr. HASSOLD. Thank you. I think from a traditional counterintelligence perspective, collaboration allows for things like source recruiting and things like my panelists previously have said, but
from a cyber perspective, I believe that collaboration centralizes the
information that’s used by universities from a research perspective
that allows for an inherent risk by pooling all of the data and research into one location that can be accessed by foreign adversaries. So I think from a cyber perspective it’s more of a sense of
centralizing the data and making the data more vulnerable for
attackers.
Chairman ABRAHAM. All right. Thank you.
Mr. Wessel, in your testimony you stated that we needed to act
to preserve our own technology and confront China’s predatory and
protectionist actions to ensure the existence of the global commons.
Has the U.S. Federal Government taken steps to confront this at
our academic institutions? How would you suggest we confront China’s actions? And what consequences do we take the appropriate
action to do so?
Mr. WESSEL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Although that probably
would take me a day or two to respond, I don’t think we’ve done
enough to send a message that—both to the Chinese and other nations but also to players here about the seriousness. As you probably recall, in May 2014, five PLA hackers were indicted for going
into a number of our major companies here, not universities but
major companies. There’s no follow-up action to that. The indictment was sealed. Those five PLA hackers may not be able to come
to Disneyland, but they’re doing quite well. So there have been few
costs to the Chinese or other nations for what they’re doing.
You talked about indictments, et cetera. There are some one-offs.
We have to do a much better job of identifying the critical technologies that China and other nations want and enhancing the
safeguards around those. And, as the President is doing now in
terms of the theft and coercive taking of intellectual property by
the Chinese is make sure that there are sanctions that are effective
and people understand that the overall framework has to change.
Sanctions to respond to the illegal activities need to be upgraded.
They need to be much more public. We also need to do a much better job of training those people here as to what the risks are.
Chairman ABRAHAM. Thank you. My time is up.
Ms. Esty, you’re recognized for five minutes.
Ms. ESTY. Well, thank you very much.
Again, I want to thank all of you for joining us here today. This
is an extremely important topic.
I represent Connecticut. I have Yale just to the south of me,
UConn Medical Center to the north of me, and so these are very
serious issues for the research institutions that I’m honored to represent.
To all of you, and based on the anecdotes you shared with us
here today, it seems like there’s a very serious lack of situational
awareness of people in the academy. I have a husband who’s not
in this field but has a lot of foreign students. He has grad students.
We increasingly in the STEM fields have—the vast majority of our
students are foreign-born. We have benefited enormously by that
openness, but that makes us extremely vulnerable.

106
Can you try to drill down for us a little bit on what you think
we can do to raise that level of awareness within institutions that
allows them the freedom that they are going to want to have and
need to have to share widely—that collaboration is important—but
to be aware that with that openness comes a responsibility to be
more on guard? And I think frankly we have not been. People are
becoming aware of the phishing risks, but maybe not this broader
one, don’t really think that it’s possible that you might actually
have spies. It’s sort of not in the mindset of the academics. So how
do we preserve that openness but raise that awareness?
And if you have thoughts of appropriate ways for us to do that,
I think it’s really important because it’s not always laws that we
need to be passing. A lot of times it’s actually helping people do the
right thing and being aware of what the risks are. Thank you.
Mr. GOLDEN. I’ll mention one or two things. Intellectual property
courses are, at most universities, confined to law schools, so there’s
generally not access for, you know, science students to take them,
and, as a result, studies have shown that relatively few graduates
in fields like engineering or the sciences understand concepts like
what is a trade secret. So I think having those kind of courses or
training more broadly.
And the other point I’d make is that, you know, universities have
security people and research security people, but they tend to be,
you know, dependent on professors and people in the classroom to
report something that they see that might, you know, seem amiss.
And, you know, in fact one case that did happen that I looked
at in my book where there were two scholars visiting Boston from
a university in China that’s partly run and funded by China’s intelligence ministry and the scholars were just kind of visiting all
these different universities. They didn’t really have an office at
UMass Boston; they were just dropping in wherever they felt like
it, the Northeastern research security people got a tip and, you
know, recognized that we better monitor what these two people are
doing. So—but they’re dependent on professors and grad students
to let them know, and so training or understanding would be of
great benefit there.
Ms. ESTY. Does anyone have courses already developed and is
that something you could maybe—may be that’s something that
needs to be done to do a mini course. Having been a law student,
a lot of law students don’t take intellectual property courses, so I
think you’re going to need to have something that’s a mini version
that’s accessible to people but to realize that these things have real
value. You have a responsibility to safeguard it, and that’s part of
your basically fiduciary duty as a researcher and as a student to
be aware of that. And that if you see something, say something notion. I think there’s a lot of times people don’t know. And something may strike them as a little odd but they don’t realize like
that could mean something.
And so maybe that’s something you can follow up with us with
some suggestions about developing curricula and things that we
could try to get help from the National Science Foundation and
others to work with our research institutions large and small to
have them be more aware of these are the kinds of things you
might see and you should be equipping your faculty to be aware

107
because, again, I think we’re concerned about clamping down on
academic freedom, and so this may lend itself to awareness at the
very least. So——
Mr. GOLDEN. Definitely. I’d be glad to.
Ms. ESTY. Well, thank you. I appreciate that. And I see my time
is almost up. Thank you, and I yield back.
Mr. WESSEL. If I could just add quickly because it’s been noted
by you, Mr. Chairman, and others that much of this research is
federally funded. It’s our—your constituents’ tax dollars. There can
be ties to that with the universities to make sure they are putting
in place the kind of counterintelligence and other systems and education in place to make sure that their professors, their researchers, their students have a better understanding of what the threat
factors are.
Chairman ABRAHAM. Thank you. Mrs. Comstock?
Mrs. COMSTOCK. Thank you.
The Iran case demonstrates that nefarious foreign actors use
cyber means to access valuable research and development, and numerous case studies in China, as was detailed, reveal that human
intelligence is used to gain access. And the FBI has recognized two
methods: seeding operations and recruitment operations. So could
you discuss, any of you, any specific cases that fall into each of
these and the methods or means utilized by the foreign agents to
access and exfiltrate valuable R&D?
Ms. VAN CLEAVE. Well, I suspect Dan has a long list of particular
cases that he can cite, but I just want to confirm that those methodologies, as well as others, are used systematically by foreign intelligence services not only on our campuses but, you know, elsewhere in the country to go after the things that they are interested
in. And it isn’t casual. Sometimes there’s a misunderstanding that,
you know, maybe it’s just a casual undertaking. That’s not the
case.
China, for instance, and Russia as well, have very sophisticated,
which is to say highly developed, acquisition strategies for where
they’re going, the things that they want, how they’re going to get
them. The cyber opportunities certainly are tremendous now, but
old-fashioned espionage is still very much a part of these activities.
And what that says to me as a counterintelligence professional is
that we have an opportunity. If we can gain the intelligence insights into what they’re doing and how they’re doing it, then we
have the chance to get inside of those operations in order to be able
to degrade them or stop them or better protect ourselves.
So whether it’s cyber operations that would influence our democratic institutions and processes or whether it’s espionage, going
after our national security secrets or our laboratories or the research activities in academia, getting inside of those operations
gives us the advantage. And that’s where we’ve been falling short.
Mrs. COMSTOCK. Okay. And are these actors being recruited and
then sent to the United States to infiltrate in some way when it’s
actual people or are they being recruited by other—you know, here
trying to get—what is the recruitment process when it’s human intelligence?
Ms. VAN CLEAVE. All of the above.
Mrs. COMSTOCK. Right.

108
Ms. VAN CLEAVE. Again, it looks at where are the opportunities,
so you——
Mrs. COMSTOCK. They target—they go for what they want to access first——
Ms. VAN CLEAVE. Right.
Mrs. COMSTOCK. —and they build the plan——
Ms. VAN CLEAVE. Right.
Mrs. COMSTOCK. —around that?
Ms. VAN CLEAVE. So put yourself in their place. So if you are a
Chinese Government entity that is looking to develop next-generation ASAT capability and you know that these specific kinds of
technologies are the subject of research at particular universities
here or in laboratories, what do you want to do? You want to be
able to get close to the people who are close to that. You want to
find other ways in to try to acquire these technologies, and so
you’re going to use all of the means at your disposal in order to do
that. But it isn’t casual. You’re very serious about your objectives,
and you know that this works quite well. The Russians, the same.
They used to build in—and they probably still do—the acquisition
of Western technologies into their design plans for weapons systems. They knew they could get what they needed here, and so that
would be part of their planning activity. So that very much is still
going on.
Mrs. COMSTOCK. Thank you. Mr. Golden?
Mr. GOLDEN. I could speak to this issue a little bit. I could give
you any number of cases. They’re not always where the government directly sends somebody or recruits somebody. As Michael
mentioned, China has these very aggressive brain-game programs
that provide incentives for particularly researchers in the United
States of Chinese descent to come home and—with research that
they might not have come by honestly. And those programs have
not succeeded in recruiting sort of tenured professors at top-notch
American institutions. They don’t really want to go back to China
no matter what the offer is. So they tend to appeal to sort of fringe
professors at lesser institutions, maybe they don’t have tenure, and
the message to them is kind of don’t come home empty-handed. So
there’s kind of an incentive for them to bring something back.
There was a case involving a research assistant at Medical College of Wisconsin. Hua Jun Zhao, he basically—his professor had
invented kind of a cancer-fighting compound, and he applied for
one of these brain-game programs saying that he was the inventor.
And the application he sent was basically a duplicate of a grant
proposal that his professor had filed. So there’s that kind of case.
In the Duke case I mentioned, it’s not clear if Ruopeng Liu was
actually working for the Chinese Government. More likely, he was
on his own knowing, that this would be welcomed when he got
home. You know, and in fact it was. He got heavily subsidized by
the government and he set up a business and an institute, you
know, but it still kind of, you know, theft of an American research
that he was enterprising enough to go after essentially.
Mrs. COMSTOCK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman ABRAHAM. Thank you, Mrs. Comstock.
Mr. Beyer, five minutes.

109
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. And look, before I dive into this, I just want to take a moment to again implore
this committee to provide oversight to EPA Administrator Pruitt.
Administrator Pruitt’s alleged unethical behavior, his wasteful use
of taxpayer money, his ongoing efforts to undermine the EPA’s mission to protect our environment and our public health, this warrants serious Congressional oversight.
I previously requested that Chairman Smith bring Administrator
Pruitt before the Science Committee to testify as to standard practice, and now, amid daily and abundant scandals, this is more crucial than ever.
Administrator Pruitt’s predecessor, Gina McCarthy, Mr. Chairman, as you know well, testified before this committee again and
again and again, once just on text messages to her husband. Administrator—in contrast, Administrator Pruitt has been confirmed
14 months ago and he has yet to appear before the committee that
has oversight. He cannot be allowed to continue to sell our nation’s
clean air and water to special interests without consequences even
without our questions.
And if the President refuses to hold him accountable, then Congress has to do its job. Science, Space, and Technology Committee
needs to do its job and conduct meaningful oversight.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for that digression.
Mr. Golden, your book gives lots of examples about how foreign
intelligence agencies especially from China attempt to use various
methods to obtain sensitive research and technical information
through the use of human sources, spies. Given the increasing
power of digital tools to wage cyber warfare and collect colossal
amounts of data, for example, Mr. Zuckerberg, who’s over at the
House Energy and Commerce Committee this morning, why do foreign intelligence agencies need human resources at all anymore?
Mr. GOLDEN. Thank you. That’s a good question and I don’t have
a definitive answer, but I think that cyber and human intelligence
gathering should be seen as complementary rather than sort of as
in competition. I mean, there are insights you can gain, secrets you
can find out that are not necessarily in the digital world so that,
you know, there’s a certain body of information that cyber and data
hacking or gathering is vital to gain, but there’s still, you know,
many things that people don’t, you know, confide to email, don’t
put down in writing, and can be gained by recruiting a source. And
other things can also be done by human intelligence but not by
cyber. For example, recruiting a graduate student and steering him
to apply for a job in a given federal agency is not something that
you can do with a cyber attack, you know?
Mr. BEYER. Do you see any difference in the trade craft, for example, between China and Russia?
Mr. GOLDEN. I’m not sort of an expert more broadly beyond academia, but I would say that the China—most of the examples you
find in China or most of what I’ve learned have to do often with
targeting research, and the Russian examples more often have to
do with seeking political or economic secrets.
Mr. BEYER. Thank you very much.
Mr. Wessel, in your testimony you talked about the National Security Higher Education Advisory Board created in 2005. And we

110
learned earlier the FBI disbanded it. Do you think when it existed
that it served a useful function, and how important is it to have
this regular communication between the law enforcement intelligence communities on the one hand and the academic communities on the other?
Mr. WESSEL. I think that is vital and it should be reinstated, and
I think we need to find other ways of communicating and collaborating with our universities, especially, again, those with highvalue targets—that are high-value targets. There are lists of those
universities that are engaged in classified research as it relates to
defense contracts, et cetera. There are some critical areas of cutting-edge research that we view as the future of America’s economy
and our success. And the collaboration is vital. If we view the academic institutions as a principal threat vector, the government
needs to be doing much more to make sure that our universities
are playing their role.
Mr. BEYER. To continue—thank you, Mr. Wessel—you suggested
that the Confucius Institute, their personnel should be required to
register as foreign agents under the Foreign Agents Registration
Act. How does the Confucius Institute differ from the GoetheInstitut, the British Institute, Alliance Francaise?
Mr. WESSEL. I can’t say that I know all of those other entities,
so I’m not sure I’m qualified to answer other than the Confucius
Institutes have a very clear role in extending China’s soft power at
a time when we find them to be challenging us on many fronts
both in terms of such issues as the South China Sea and geopolitical issues but also again militarily and economically. So with
my work on the China Commission, that’s what I focus on, not
what some of the other countries are doing, so I’ll have to get back
to you on that.
Mr. BEYER. Okay. All right.
Mr. GOLDEN. I could speak to the—that issue a little bit.
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Golden, only if the Chair—the new Chair—perhaps we will cycle back to it because my time is up.
Mr. GOLDEN. It’s okay.
Mr. BEYER. Thank you very much.
Mr. HIGGINS. [Presiding] Thank you. And the Chair—my Chairman has excused himself for a moment, so I’m going to recognize
myself for five minutes of questioning.
Ms. Van Cleave, just to clarify for the American people whom we
serve, we’re understanding today, and based upon research of myself and my colleagues prior to this hearing, that the American people are funding, through university grants, the Federal Government harvests treasure from the American people to fund university grants that go to research and development programs at our
universities. Those research and development programs designed to
enhance the economic strength of America and the military might
of America, the predominance of American university-level research, and that research is being stolen and harvested by foreign
nationals and brought to their own nations in order to give those
nations predominance, as paid for by the American people. So essentially the American people are funding the predominant position of foreign nations, is that correct?
Ms. VAN CLEAVE. Very well put, Mr. Chairman.

111
Mr. HIGGINS. Let me ask you, regarding university grant applications for research and development, do those applications include
any verification of policies or procedures that are in place at that
university to protect intellectual properties and to confirm that
they have cybersecurity systems in place and even general security
systems in place? Does a grant application right now include any
sort of confirmation that that university has the ability or even the
intent to protect the research and development that we would fund
through that grant?
Ms. VAN CLEAVE. Certainly through classified research grants, I
know very careful restrictions like that are in place. I think some
of my other panelists can speak to open grants.
Mr. HIGGINS. Comment?
Mr. WESSEL. Just——
Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Wessel?
Mr. WESSEL. Just as it relates to nonpublic meaning, you know,
when a pharmaceutical company goes to a research institute for
collaborative research on, you know, cancer drugs, et cetera, there
are extensive documents about what security measures they may—
they must put in place, nondisclosure agreements, et cetera. My
understanding is for a number of federal programs that does not
exist.
Mr. GOLDEN. When research is export-controlled, you know, then
it’s limited to certain countries so students need approval and some
that can’t get approval sometimes. Basic research, I don’t think
there’s many security provisions, although on the Duke case I mentioned, when they then published an article that showed that some
of the funding was from the Chinese Government on this invisibility research, you know, the Pentagon funders got upset and contacted the professor and—who put a—who ended that, so there are
some monitoring there.
Mr. HIGGINS. Thank you for those answers. In my opinion, to my
colleagues I suggest that grant applications should include some
verification of the levels of training and awareness that we are certainly highlighting today.
Mr. Hassold, through your work, you found that at least 144 universities were breached by Iranian hackers over the last five years.
These hackers took 31 terabytes—that’s my understanding—31
terabytes of R&D-related materials. Were these universities being
targeted specifically because of the research conducted there?
Mr. HASSOLD. So those numbers came from the DOJ indictment.
The numbers that I have found is 174 American universities that
have been targeted by this group. The firsthand observations I’ve
been able to see is that the purpose of that targeting was to get
access to the centralized academic databases that most American
and most Western universities have access to to exfiltrate research
articles from those databases. Of course, the—one of the clear indications based on the targets that have been selected in those attacks is the possibility that research specific to certain universities
is exfiltrated. When you look at some of the targets, some of the
high-profile targets that the U.S. Government works with, there’s
that possibility. I think that’s hinted at in the indictment but that
is secondhand information that I have.

112
Mr. HIGGINS. And do you agree that universities should provide
proper training for their professors, researchers, and staff to defend
against cyber threats? Do you agree with that assessment?
Mr. HASSOLD. Absolutely 100 percent.
Mr. HIGGINS. I would suggest to my colleagues that today’s hearing has made clear the extent to which our nation’s research and
development is targeted and exposed, and witness testimony confirms this threat is real. We must ensure that universities are taking this threat seriously and understand the precautions being
taken to safeguard their equities. I believe we would greatly benefit
as a nation by hearing from our universities on this matter, and
I hope this committee continues to take action on this issue.
My time is expired. The Chair recognizes Ms. Bonamici from Oregon for five minutes.
Ms. BONAMICI. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thanks
to the Chairs and the Ranking Members and our witnesses for testifying today. I appreciate the concerns of course that were raised
in the testimony and by our colleagues, but I also want to acknowledge the immense benefits economically, socially, and academically
of welcoming foreign students to our academic institutions. This is
about finding the right balance.
When informed of this hearing, my alma mater, the University
of Oregon, was proud to point out that they have long sought international students not only for the intellectual and cultural diversity they bring but also for the opportunity to encourage American
students to be more globally aware and engaged. With that in
mind, I hope our focus today can be finding that appropriate balance to make sure that our universities are secure and vigilant but
also accessible hubs of learning and creative exchange.
And I want to thank Ranking Member Beyer for asking about
the National Security Higher Education Board. It seems that that
is something that we could work on together to make sure that
that is reconvened and operating because I know it’s been beneficial to universities in my home State and across the country.
That’s been a useful venue for the academic and security communities to discuss those challenges.
I wanted to ask, we know that there are many American students who study abroad and academics as well working abroad who
could be vulnerable to recruitment or unwitting involvement in espionage by a foreign actor. So could any of you describe what, if
anything, we’re doing to protect and prepare our students, professors, and researchers from being exploited when they are abroad?
Mr. Golden, you look like you are turning on your microphone.
Mr. GOLDEN. Good observation. The—thanks. You know, there’s
one renowned case in this field of Glenn Duffie Shriver who had
been a student at Grand Valley State and soon after he graduated
he went to China—he went to China first in college in a studyabroad program and right after—and was recruited by Chinese intelligence and they—you know, they paid him to take the foreign
service exam but he failed and then they paid him to try and enter
the CIA and he was caught and imprisoned. And the FBI made a
video about it called Game of Pawns and——
Ms. BONAMICI. Widely panned I might——

113
Mr. GOLDEN. Yes, it wasn’t that well-received but it also—you
know, they tried to get universities to show it in their orientations
for study-abroad programs, and the universities, a lot of them objected. They felt they had limited orientation time. There’s a lot of
things to orient the students about, you know, local conditions,
what do you do if you’re ill, stay away from drugs, whatever, and
so most of them did not show it. Now that might have been a good
decision on aesthetic grounds, but, you know, there probably could
be some, you know, discussion of some kind of orientation for students before they go overseas, as well as for the professors——
Ms. BONAMICI. Right.
Mr. GOLDEN. —who lead those trips and because they are, you
know, playing in the other country’s territory and they are potential targets.
Ms. BONAMICI. I believe that was back in 2014 that video was
made. That could be something that we could discuss as well to
make sure that there is something meaningful.
Last December, the White House released its national security
strategy that indicated that the Trump Administration plans to
consider restrictions on foreign STEM students from designated
countries to ensure that intellectual property is not transferred to
our competitors. Mr. Golden, you were quoted in an Inside Higher
Education article responding to when FBI Director Christopher
Wray testified, and you said, quote, ‘‘The vast majority of Chinese
students are just here to learn and maybe do research and they
bring energy and intelligence and fresh perspective to American
higher education. They’re quite valuable. It would be wrong and
unfair to assume that some very large proportion of them are here
for clandestine purposes.’’ And I appreciate that, and again, this is
about finding the balance.
Can you talk about the concerns or the problems that might
come from casting an entire group of students, researchers, and
professors from a particular country as a danger to national security based on that country of origin, and how might that hinder our
ability to attract the brightest minds around the world to study,
conduct research, and work here in the United States?
Mr. GOLDEN. Sure. Yes, in general, the globalization of higher
education I think is a wonderful thing, and the advantages outweigh the drawbacks. And the students from China and other
countries, they come and, you know, many of them are extremely
bright and wonderful researchers and contribute to research done
in the United States. And in fact, you know, the great majority—
although the percentage has gone down some, the great majority
who come over as graduate students or get their doctorates here
stay here for, you know, at least five to ten years after or make
their whole careers here. And then, you know, the research they
do, you know, redounds the benefit to the United States rather
than China.
I mean, particularly since Tiananmen Square, that’s been the
case. And if you look at it in that light, China almost has—you
know, they’re losing so much talent that that’s why they’re having
these aggressive brain-drain programs and that’s why they feel
probably pressure to use espionage because, you know, so many of
their best and brightest are making their greatest discoveries in

114
the United States for the benefit of American universities and the
American economy and the American Government.
So, you know, I think it would be a mistake to, you know, turn
off the faucet of bringing Chinese students to this country, and instead, that’s why we ought to look for more—other things such as,
as I mentioned, intellectual property classes, more collaboration
agreements that spell out what can and can’t be done on each side
and those kinds of things because, you know, foreign students contribute a great deal to the United States in any number of ways.
Ms. BONAMICI. Thank you. I see my time is expired, but as I
yield back, I want to note that there have been several topics here
that we could work on on a bipartisan basis to make sure that
we’re protecting our universities and our data. And thank you very
much. I yield back.
Mr. HIGGINS. I thank my colleague.
And Mr. Loudermilk from Georgia is recognized for five minutes
for questions.
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I agree with
Ms. Bonamici. This is something that should be bipartisan. It is
something definitely concerning to me, and it should be to not only
every member of this committee but Congress and those in the universities. This is a meeting of two areas of which I have experience
and a great interest working in intelligence and technology in the
Air Force.
I was greatly concerned when it was mentioned that Sandia Labs
has been a target. Working with Sandia Labs in the past I know
the type of research and development they do, and it is definitely
of a national security concern with me and even with other research institutions that I work with in this capacity and that I
have in my 20 years in the IT sector. This is an area that should
have much more attention than we are giving it right now.
And, Mr. Golden, I want to congratulate you. There is a waiting
list for your book at the Library of Congress, which I am on, so apparently it is beginning to grow.
Mr. Hassold, as you’ve mentioned, you’ve conducted extensive
work on the Iranian breach at these institutions and provided the
FBI with your findings. Can you walk us through how the Iranians
were able to breach these university systems?
Mr. HASSOLD. Sure. So with any phishing attack, it always starts
with the lure that is generally email-based. All of these attacks
were—had email-based lures. So they were sent out to a number
of different students and faculty. Some were very targeted, as is
referenced in the indictment from a couple weeks ago. Some were
more general, sent to a wider range of students and faculty. When
you look at those lures, they are incredibly sophisticated. The spelling, grammar, the things that you traditionally look for to identify
potentially malicious emails, everything there has been perfect.
And one of the—I think the interesting and notable aspects of
them is that they have barely evolved over time. If you look at a
lure from three years ago, I had—I found a lure from three years
ago that targeted American University, and I found another lure
targeting an Australian university just 3 or 4 months ago. The content of those emails were exactly the same. And I think one of the

115
interesting parts of that is sort of it denotes the probable success
rate that the threat actors had with using those lures.
So the lures were very sophisticated. They—if you look at some
of the information that was contained within them, it’s clear that
they did probable manual reconnaissance to collect information
that is targeted to the university specifically that makes them more
persuasive. From the lures, you go to the phishing sites themselves. The content of the phishing sites is a near replica of the legitimate login pages that someone would see if they’re going to the
actual site. The URLs were patterned to look extremely similar to
the actual login page. And then after someone enters information
into those phishing pages, they would generally be sent off to what
we would call a drop email account, which is generally a temporary
email account where the compromise credentials are received.
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Okay. And if we could bring up—I’ve got a couple of slides—screenshots of the landing page.
[Slide.]

116

117
Mr. LOUDERMILK. The one on the top is the actual University of
Pennsylvania library page. Actually, the top one is the phishing
site. I’m correct—corrected, and at the bottom is the actual. This
is incredible. I mean, this is highly sophisticated. It indicated to
me, looking at this, that this is not just a rogue actor. This has
state sponsorship. There is a lot of work gone into this, which, from
the technology standpoint or an IT standpoint, you’re only going to
put this type of effort to go after a highly valued target and—which
is really concerning.
And based on your experience with this and the other work that
you’re doing, how vulnerable are these institutions as compared to,
let’s say, our business community or corporations? Are they more—
is academia more vulnerable or less?
Mr. HASSOLD. I think one of the primary vulnerabilities for the
academic community is not that—is not that different than the—
than most other industries and most other businesses. I think the
challenge, as I said in my testimony, is that you have a number
of different components that feed into the university network. You
have students, you have faculty, and then you have employees—
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Right.
Mr. HASSOLD. —and each of those need to have awareness and
training. And by nature of the academic community, a lot of those
members are transient, so the ability to train them and give them
like fully—a full awareness of the actual risks is much more challenging than some other businesses where most of the employees
are sort of centralized and you have a better opportunity to train
them.
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Are they a softer target? And then a lot of
times we look at often more effort is put into going after—well, if
you have two targets of high-value, you’re going to put more effort
in the softer target than the harder. Are the universities a softer
target than, let’s say, the corporations because of the—what you
just laid out for us?
Mr. HASSOLD. I think that they hold sort of like—sort of like you
mentioned, they hold specific value to the people who are targeting
them, so I don’t think they are softer and the technical defenses
are that much worse than general businesses, but I think they hold
a certain value to the people who are targeting them that’s much
different than you look at the reasons that generally—general businesses are being targeted.
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Okay. I do have several other questions but I
see my time is expired, so if we do a second round or if somebody
else yields any, I’ll have a couple other questions for you.
With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. HIGGINS. I thank my colleague.
And Mr. Lipinski from Illinois is recognized for five minutes for
questions.
Mr. LIPINSKI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And I want to thank the Chairman and Ranking Member for
holding this hearing. Certainly this is a very important issue. I
have been very outspoken about the theft of intellectual property,
especially by Chinese actors, but others around the world. It’s a
great threat to our economic security. I, though, think that we need

118
to make sure that we’re using a scalpel and not an ax to this problem.
I appreciate Mr. Golden’s comments about the value of having
foreign nationals come to study here in the United States. So many
Chinese have come here, as you mentioned, Mr. Golden, and have
contributed to the United States not just both research-wise and
also in regard to helping economically our nation.
As an academic, I understand that, you know, my impression is
that there is a lot more that can be done in order to make sure
that our academic researchers are aware of the threats that are out
there, nothing that I was doing—when I was doing my research
was—would’ve been of interest to anyone economically for espionage, but—or for any reason like that, but I know Mr. Golden had
mentioned a few things that you think should be done to improve
security at universities and awareness by professors and students
of potential intelligence threats they face.
I want to know if there’s anything else that any of our panelists
wanted to add that can be done that you think universities should
be doing, and is there any way to encourage universities to do more
of improving awareness of faculty members, staff, and students at
universities? Ms. Van Cleave?
Ms. VAN CLEAVE. Congressman, I understand that within the 56
field offices of the FBI one of their responsibilities is to be able to
work with universities within their jurisdictions to be able to raise
awareness. So to have good relations between the field offices of the
FBI and the universities is something where one would encourage
university leadership to take advantage of that kind of awareness
opportunity that the Bureau represents, and we’ve asked them to
take on the job.
But I’d also like to interject something to sort of round out the
picture here. We’ve talked about the value—the extraordinary
value of having international students here on our campuses, and
it’s good for us, it’s good for our student population, it’s good for
America generally to have them here. And we’ve also said it’s good
for the foreign students who come here. Their lives are enriched,
and especially those who are coming from countries that may be
closed or may not have our freedoms and liberties.
And we are welcoming them here and showing them perhaps a
different way, a new way of life, which leads me to interject this:
The foreign intelligence presence on our universities is not limited
to trying to develop sources or trying to access our research. There
is yet a third purpose behind their presence on our university campuses. For some countries that purpose is to enforce their security
concerns about their foreign nationals who are present there. So
look at it from the standpoint of those young students who may be
here experiencing new things, while at the same time, they know
they’re being watched. And that is something that I find to be troubling. So I think we should be also aware of that purpose of the
foreign intelligence presence on our universities.
Mr. GOLDEN. That’s actually—I think Michelle makes a very
good point there because there’s always—there’s been a feeling at
several universities I think that in some classes Chinese students
may be afraid to speak candidly for fear that other students are
keeping an eye on them and reporting back. You know, and there’s

119
been recent publicity about—I think it’s called the Chinese Student
and Scholars Association and its connection to the Chinese Embassy. And I spoke to Derek Bok, the former President of Harvard,
for my book and he said that a professor at Harvard Law School
at one point had come to him and said Chinese students were telling them they couldn’t speak candidly in class because of that fear.
And Harvard tried to figure out what it could do about it and
couldn’t come up with anything.
Mr. LIPINSKI. Well, I was going to ask, what can be done about
that?
Mr. GOLDEN. Yes, he said they just didn’t have the capacity to
try and investigate that on their own. Harvard didn’t know what
to do, so I don’t think they did much of anything. But it is another
concern of students feeling like they don’t have the freedom to
speak up.
Mr. LIPINSKI. And anyone else, any suggestions, recommendations, incentives that we could give to universities to make sure
that they are, you know, paying attention to all of these issues?
Mr. HASSOLD. I think one of the things that—one of the focuses
is—that we talked about today is cooperation between universities
and law enforcement. I think there also needs to be more cooperation between universities themselves. Mr. Beyer earlier brought up
REN–ISAC, which is an absolutely fantastic resource that universities have access to. It’s very much a centralized repository of
knowledge specifically for cyber attacks targeting universities. As
I understand it, I’ve gotten to know the folks over there pretty well
over the course of my research. Their operational team is only
about a half dozen people at this point, and they handle about, you
know, a couple hundred institutions. Those types of entities are—
would be much more valuable to the university as a whole so they
understand what’s going on, targeting other universities and not
just what’s going on targeting their own university.
Mr. LIPINSKI. Very good. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman,
for the extra time.
Mr. HIGGINS. I thank my colleague, and I recognize Mr. Marshall
from Kansas for five minutes for questioning.
Mr. MARSHALL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My first question is
for Ms. Van Cleave.
Ms. Van Cleave, I’m a freshman Congressman, and one of my
jobs is trying to prioritize and figure out how big problems are.
There’s plenty of problems for us to solve. You know, our trade deficit was a $575 billion problem. I’ve been told that this intellectual
theft may be worth $500 billion, $1 trillion. Can you kind of put
a number to it or just a wild guess on how much is this impacting
our country every year?
Ms. VAN CLEAVE. So the Intellectual Property Commission headed up by Admiral Blair and Ambassador Huntsman first met in
2013 and issued a landmark report. They updated it just last year,
and their estimate is $510 billion roughly in intellectual property
theft in the last year.
Mr. MARSHALL. And all that could basically buy down our trade
deficit. That’s amazing.
I think I’ll go to Mr. Wessel next. Mr. Lipinski talked about
using a scalpel. I would talk about using a laser. If you were to

120
focus on the companies that are the bad actors, the cheaters, the
people that are basically robbing our banks, what are we doing now
to punish them? What could we do? Why aren’t we punishing these
people that are trying to steal—and stealing the bigger companies?
Is anything happening?
Mr. WESSEL. There are some things happening at—you know,
the problem, as identified by the Commission and many others is
ongoing and, you know, there’s no way to get your hands around
it all the time. But the failure to have significant ongoing sanctions
has sent a message that much of what goes on you can get away
with.
You may recall that President Xi and President Obama signed a
memorandum of understanding on the use of cyber espionage for
economic gain. The problem was that the Chinese don’t view economic gain as, you know, a separate inbox on the President’s desk.
Economic and national security are inextricably intertwined. So
part of the problem is making sure we define the issue, we have
coherent responses, and that there are real sanctions and costs for
what happened.
I mentioned earlier about the indictments of the five PLA hackers for going into five U.S. companies, Westinghouse, a number of
others. The indictment was sealed. There’s been no follow-up action.
Mr. MARSHALL. And when you say sanctions, can we do sanctions
just on companies rather than entire countries?
Mr. WESSEL. Yes, you can. I mean, we’ve had—there—in those—
that situation there was a tasking, meaning that certain companies
ask the Chinese Government for information or work with them to
get it. The information was obtained through five PLA hackers and
transferred back to the companies. And then that was utilized. U.S.
Steel filed a case at the ITC on this trying to have a sanction that
was ultimately ruled—the case was thrown out. There are ways of
looking at what has been taken, what has been applied in the market and sanctioning specific companies where also a broader problem that’s going to need a more general solution to.
Mr. MARSHALL. Give me an example of something that we as
Americans would consider intellectual theft that the Chinese
wouldn’t, that it’s okay? That—you kind of mentioned something
there that I didn’t quite follow that.
Mr. WESSEL. No, when they were—after they signed the agreement, there was this view that China was going to limit its cyber
incursions into the United States and the prohibition or the agreement was it was not going to affect economic issues. They wouldn’t
do it for economic gain. But China views their economic progress,
their security, their growth rate as part of their national security.
If they can’t——
Mr. MARSHALL. So their means justifies the ends? It’s okay——
Mr. WESSEL. Correct.
Mr. MARSHALL. —to cheat as long as it benefits——
Mr. WESSEL. Correct. Their——
Mr. MARSHALL. —their national security so to speak?
Mr. WESSEL. Correct. And a different definition. They didn’t view
it as economic espionage; they viewed it as——
Mr. MARSHALL. Yes.

121
Mr. WESSEL. —enhancing their national security.
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Golden, what would you do to microfocus, to
laser in on the companies that are cheating?
Mr. HIGGINS. Would the gentleman turn his mic on, please?
Mr. MARSHALL. Okay.
Mr. GOLDEN. So I focused—my book is about espionage in academia and higher education——
Mr. MARSHALL. So, great. So people are espionaging intellectual
property from universities. What would you do to punish them?
What are we not doing? Why do we just turn her head and say it’s
okay?
Mr. GOLDEN. Well, yes, that’s a good question Congressman, and
I can speak to that. You’re right; there has been a number of examples where, you know, people have been caught spying, and the
universities have not really punished them. For example, the case
a few years ago of the Russian illegals in the United States, the
10 Russian illegals——
Mr. MARSHALL. Right.
Mr. GOLDEN. —the case that gave rise to the show The Americans, seven or eight of them had been in U.S. universities and one
of them had gone to Columbia Business School, and evidence came
out that her role there had been to recruit classmates and professors, and yet Columbia didn’t revoke her degree when it came out
that she wasn’t Cynthia Murphy, she was Lydia Guryeva and she
was working for Russia.
Mr. MARSHALL. We’re over my time. I’m sorry. I yield back the
rest of my time. Thank you.
Ms. VAN CLEAVE. Mr. Chair, if I might interject, I need to correct
the record of an answer I just gave a moment ago. The $510 billion
figure which I cited in fact is the amount that we annually invest
in R&D, but consulting my notes of the Huntsman-Blair Commission report, they had this to say last year: ‘‘We estimate that at the
low end the annual cost to the U.S. economy of several categories
of IP theft exceeds $225 billion with the unknown cost of other
types of IP theft almost certainly exceeding that amount and possibly as high as $600 billion annually.’’
Mr. MARSHALL. Six hundred billion?
Ms. VAN CLEAVE. Yes.
Mr. MARSHALL. Yes, thank you.
Mr. HIGGINS. I thank my colleagues, and if our panelists will accommodate us, we’ll have a second round of questioning if you can
all stay. Thank you. I recognize myself for five minutes for questioning.
Mr. Wessel and Ms. Van Cleave, the China-United States Exchange Foundation, a China-based and government-connected foundation, is registered as a foreign agent representing China. Do you
find it concerning that some universities in the United States have
accepted funding from this foreign agent, and how should universities handle outside organizations like this when it comes to potential funding? Mr. Wessel?
Mr. WESSEL. I find it very troubling and talk about that briefly
in my testimony. It’s a function of a number of things, including
the funding problems I think was referred to earlier that we face
with higher education. They are seeking these funds. They are

122
seeking foreign students who often pay the full boat when they’re
applying.
I think, number one, we should be monitoring their activities.
Number two, we should be requiring that students who attend
those programs be informed of the nature of the sponsorship. The
curriculum, the personnel are chosen by the Chinese Government
or those working for the Chinese Government, and their materials
should have a disclaimer on it so people understand that this is an
attempt to influence and it’s essentially propaganda.
Mr. HIGGINS. Ms. Van Cleave?
Ms. VAN CLEAVE. It’s hard to add to that statement. I fully endorse what Michael said. This is a serious concern. Of course, it is
also an opportunity when we know that there’s a specific foreign
interest in a particular university. From a counterintelligence perspective, it shines a light that that nation-state has a particular interest here and is willing to invest money in it, but it’s small compensation for the risk presented.
Mr. HIGGINS. Is there enhanced vetting at the federal level for
a foreign exchange student out of a potential threat nation-state
like China where there’s examples of intellectual property theft? Is
there enhanced vetting at the federal level right now prior to the
university level?
Ms. VAN CLEAVE. Not that I am aware of. Others on the panel
may have a different insight on that——
Mr. HIGGINS. I think they should be.
Ms. VAN CLEAVE. —but as long as they’re meeting the requirement for the visa to be issued and they have the support of the university, we are a very open and welcoming country.
Mr. HIGGINS. Let me ask you each this question. How can the
United States universities vet or conduct due diligence on potential
Chinese or other foreign partners that may have access to our laboratories and in our universities?
Mr. WESSEL. My view of that is that’s primarily a governmental
role and not the universities’ but that—where there are—again research that’s going on either with cleared defense contractors with
governmental agencies where there’s federal money, there should
be a certain level of scrutiny.
And to your earlier question, one of the problems we found at the
China Commission was that foreign students were coming in under
visas, for example, to study liberal arts, and once—and they would
change a semester later to physics, to computer sciences, et cetera,
where there may be threats that we want to look at. Universities
should be responsible when the terms of a student’s participation
at the university has changed, to talk to the authorities, inform
them, and then leave it to the authorities as to whether there
should be follow-up.
Mr. HIGGINS. Do you believe vetting at the federal level should
be tied to the intended course of study for foreign exchange students?
Mr. WESSEL. I believe the—for the target of the research—and
so I’m focused more on the laboratory work that’s done rather than
just the general teaching at a university, so a computer science
course is one thing, but if that person goes into computer science

123
lab where there may be work on encryption, for example, that
should have higher scrutiny.
Mr. HIGGINS. And for federally funded university laboratories,
should there not be a responsibility to report that adjustment of
that student’s intended course of study?
Mr. WESSEL. Yes. As I said earlier, if they change the terms of
their visas when they came here and what the situation they were
supposed to enter, if that changes, there should be information to
the Federal Government.
Mr. HIGGINS. Thank you for your answers.
I recognize my colleague, Mr. Beyer, for five minutes for questions.
Mr. BEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, very much.
You know, the National Science Board recently released its biennial Science and Engineering Indicators report, and the basics is
that federal investment in basic research and development vis-a-vis
the United States, the Chinese are rapidly gaining ground on us.
I talked to many of my friends in the medical field, and they just
talk about how much more they’re investing than we are. And of
course this is unacceptable if we want to maintain our leadership
in science and engineering.
But to the point of this commission, what role does persistent flat
funding of U.S. science research have on our reliance on cost-sharing with international partners or give us additional vulnerabilities
in terms of espionage? Anyone want to grapple with that question?
Mr. WESSEL. I think it makes us vulnerable. There have been instances in the past, again, from the China perspective where there
have been investments by or attempted investments by Chinese entities, government-affiliated in our universities and those that
have, you know, stable funding in States where they’re a public
university where there have been budget cuts for any of a number
of reasons, and there has been greater receptivity to those investments. That of course then opens up the underlying research to advantage other players. That has a serious cost to it.
Mr. BEYER. Great. Mr. Golden, some half-hour ago you wanted
to jump in on the Goethe-Institut vis-a-vis—well, the Confucius Institute vis-&-vis Goethe, et cetera.
Mr. GOLDEN. Yes, thank you, Congressman, for giving me that
opportunity. Well, one difference between the Confucius Institutes
and these arms of other nations is that they tend to be on campus,
whereas the institutes of the French, German, British Governments tend to be off-campus. And, you know, the Confucius Institute courses at many universities they are not for academic credit
but at some universities they are, so they’re more, you know, integrated for whatever reason kind of into the academic environment
and thus, you know, might be potentially more influential. And of
course they’re also accompanied in some cases by quite a bit of
money to the university.
I was also going to say about them, you know, there was mentions of the foundation that is part of the Chinese Government. The
Confucius Institute for all intents and purposes are an arm of the
Chinese Government. They’re from an affiliate of the Education
Ministry. And the research for my book indicated that they’re not
intended as an arm of espionage because it’s the Education Min-

124
istry, but at times, the—China’s Intelligence Ministry does approach Directors and staff of Confucius Institute and ask them to
gather information. And the FBI does as well. Both China and the
United States are interested in using Confucius Institute personnel
as intelligence assets because they’re so well-positioned.
Mr. BEYER. Okay. Thank you very much. You know, the National
Science Foundation has had a long-standing policy of rarely doing
direct support for foreign organizations and that when they did, it
would have to be allocated only to the U.S. portion of a project. But
in January this year, they revised its quote/unquote ‘‘proposal and
award policies and procedures guide’’ to address all the international branches of American universities which are springing up
around the world. And another revision calls for funding for a collaborative project involving foreign organizations, and they both
now require the proposal requesting funds for an international
branch or for a foreign organization to justify why the research activities cannot be performed on a U.S. campus or by a U.S. organization.
Do you have any thoughts on National Science Foundation’s policy change from rarely doing it out of the United States to just now
allowing it for foreign organizations and for—or for, say, the
George Mason campus in Qatar? Any thoughts?
Mr. WESSEL. My thought is I’d prefer—vastly prefer that it be occurring on U.S. university campuses, and if there’s a gap here that
our government, NSF, and others work to fill that gap here rather
than through a foreign university collaboration.
Mr. BEYER. Yes. Well, thank you. You know, that’s sort of the
half-point I wanted to make. On the one hand, the previous question, we want a—we keep hearing again and again that the National Science Foundation is able to award an ever-smaller percentage of its excellent proposals with money because there’s just not
enough research money with this interesting change in policy, suggesting that they’re going to invest overseas rather than here. So—
anyway, thank you very much.
Mr. Chair, I yield back.
Mr. HIGGINS. I thank my colleague and recognize Mr.
Loudermilk for five minutes for questions.
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the additional time.
Mr. Hassold, I kind of want to circle back to where we left off
in the previous questioning regarding the Iranian attacks on our
universities. We were discussing whether or not they were softer
targets, and you explained that there’s more transition within the
universities and a lot of corporate businesses. A follow-up on that
is did these Iranian actors have the same success rate with nonacademic organizations, institutions as they did the academic?
Mr. HASSOLD. The outcomes of the attacks is something I do not
have insight into, as well as I believe the private organizations that
were targeted is something that’s only—that I only know of
through the FBI—or the DOJ indictment.
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Okay. I appreciate that. Of the 31 terabytes
that’s been reported that was stolen, what type of data was contained in that?

125
Mr. HASSOLD. That’s also something that’s—that I don’t have
specific knowledge into. I just know that they—that the targeting
that I observed was the academic research databases. I’m assuming
that much of that 31 terabytes came from that exfiltration data.
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Okay. And from what I’ve read, a lot of it is
medical research and R&D-type information. How do these universities respond? When you notify them or when they realize that
they’ve been a target of a phishing attack or an outside breach into
their systems, how have they responded to these, specifically, the
Iranian attack?
Mr. HASSOLD. So since I’ve started researching the group and
their attacks, every time I’ve identified a new American university
that’s been targeted, I have both contacted REN–ISAC to let them
filter the information through their specific context for universities,
as well as when I’ve been able to identify a specific point of contact
at a university, I directly informed them of potential phishing attack. REN–ISAC has been fantastic. They have—we’ve been in
communication a significant amount, and they have confirmed that
notifications have gone out.
I haven’t gotten response back from universities based on my
communications. However, I wouldn’t really expect that. I would
really more expect them to take the information and try to mitigate
on their side. From what I understand with most phishing attacks,
the way a lot of universities deal with them is that they block the
malicious sites and most infrastructure on their internal networks,
which is a quick way to deal with them. However, one of the issues
with that is if there is a user that is not network that tries to access the malicious sites, that same protection is not afforded to
them. So things like actually trying to mitigate the actual sites and
shutting those sites down is an additional step that could be done
to help prevent the damage caused by these types of attacks.
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Well, have you seen, are they reporting these
IP addresses to have them blacklisted or do they communicate with
other universities? I mean, the strength of these research universities is the collaboration on their research and development. Are
they collaborating with one another to highlight that, you know,
we’ve been subjected to a phishing attack, we’ve been—data has
been breached? Are they going outside of their own infrastructure?
I mean, I commend them. You know, you go into your gateway,
your firewall, you block that IP address, but from an IT perspective, there seems to be so many more things that could be done,
hiding your page such as this so it’s not available to the public to
replicate that, that you have to be interior to the network to actually get to that page, reporting to your internet provider to have
the IP blacklisted, I mean, that’s one step that—of course, they can
change their IP addresses, but also education and collaborating
with other universities. I mean, do you see that they’re doing this
and what other steps could they or should they be taking?
Mr. HASSOLD. I’m sure every university is different specifically
how they deal with these types of attacks. There are resources like
REN–ISAC, which I’ve mentioned multiple times, that sort of is
that central place for intelligence and information-sharing that
they can use. I don’t know how much universities directly interact

126
with one another, especially—I would assume that there would be
some sort of interaction.
There are some other defensive tactics that would probably stem
the effectiveness of these types of attacks like multifactor authentication that a lot of schools don’t utilize. And from what I’ve
learned with my discussions with university partners, as well as
some of the folks at REN–ISAC, the cost associated with implementing multifactor authentication is pretty significant, and a lot
of universities don’t have the sources of funding to be able to pay
for things like that. But something like multifactor authentication
would be able to prevent some of these types of attacks after the
fact by not allowing foreign actors to be able to login to the actual
legitimate pages.
Mr. LOUDERMILK. I appreciate that. And so as with any attack,
it appears this could have been prevented by, you know—and hindsight is 20/20, but it could have been prevented.
Last question. Are the universities taking this serious enough to
prevent it from happening in the future? And I’ll open that up to
anybody on the panel.
Mr. HASSOLD. That’s a good question. That would be a question
I think would be better suited to be answered by the actual universities. I think they would probably have better insight into it. But
I think this—these—this type of threat is so sophisticated that
dealing with it would take significant resources to do and a significant planning and collaboration amongst the entire academic institution.
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Thank you. Anyone else care to—all right.
Well, Mr. Chairman, thank you. I yield back.
Mr. HIGGINS. I thank my colleague.
This has certainly been an enlightening conversation we’ve engaged in today. I thank the witnesses for their valuable testimony
and the Members for their questions. The record will remain open
for two weeks for additional comments and written questions from
Members.
The Science, Space, and Technology Oversight Subcommittee and
Research and Technology Subcommittee joint hearing is adjourned.

Development"
The Honorable Michelle Van Cleave, former National Counterintelligence
Executive
Questions Submitted by Ranking Member Daniel Lipinski,
Subcommittee on Research & Technology,
House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology
L Although a lot of our focus so far has been on China and on conduct at

research universities, I think it's important for us to think more broadly
about foreign influence on our federal R&D funding programs. Many of
these programs are advised by panels of outside experts, some of whom
work for companies controlled by foreign governments. For example, a
member of the National Space Council Users Advisory Group works for a
company mn by a Russian oligarch. As we explore ways that foreign nations
are exploiting our academic institutions, should we also be looking at ways
they may be influencing our R&D policy?
Answer: I could not agree more. From my experience and understanding,
members of Federal Advisory Committees (other than designated
representatives of non-governmental organizations) serve as Special
Government Employees. As such, they are subject to the Ethics in
Government laws, including the laws governing conflicts of interest. My
reading of those laws would suggest that working for a foreign entity with
interests contrary to those of the United States would be disqualifying. I am
not familiar with the case that you site, but on its face I find it a cause for
concern. At a minimum, the Committee may want to review the ethics laws
to ensure that the prospect of foreign influence over federal advisory
committee members is explicitly called out as a conflict of interest, and
rigorously enforced.

Answer: As has become apparent in recent years, influence operations by foreign
adversaries are becoming a significant threat to American institutions. These
operations are a more indirect method of obtaining a desired objective that take
considerably more time than a direct cyber attack to steal research material from
our public institutions and private companies. We should always be identifying
any way our adversaries could exploit our resources; however, in the future, the
biggest threats will likely come from the cyber attack surface.

FEDERAl. BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION
OFFICE OF PRIVATE SECTOR

REF. TO
FILE

NSHEAB Members,
Over the last two years, the FBI restructured and focused its external engagement strategy with
the private sector and academia in an effort to speak with one voice and align the bureau's
priorities across the enterprise. With this change, several of the FBI's most significant and
established outreach programs became the foundation for the new Office of Private Sector
division. In the process, the FBI also chose to suspend some specialized programs, including the
National Security Higher EdUCiitio'iiMvisory Board, 'and create new strategic partnerships.
Currently, OPS is exploring and evaluating mutually-beneficial academic engagement
opportunities and the potential initiation of new advisory groups to partner with the FBI. In the
interim, the FBI will continue with its vital academic engagement across all of its field offices
based on the changing threat environments identified by our substantive operational divisions,
The FBI will continue to promote engagement through its individual field offices, and those
universities and colleges in their respective areas of responsibility. This has always been the
case, and is not changing. Additionally, other academic outreach efforts are still continuing, to
include such programs as the Cyber Division's CyberSubcommittee that was initiated as an
offshoot of the NSHEAB, and the Weapons of Mass Destruction Directorate's ChemicalBiological Safety Program. The Counterterrorism Division also maintains its Campus Liaison
Officer Program.
On behalf of the FBI, thank you for your insights and participation over the years to strengthen
the relationship between.ilieu:s:·Yntelifgence, law enforcenieni-;lmd academia communities. It
has been a pleasure having you play a critical role in assisting us in our mission to protect U.S.
national security and the American people. We hope to be able to call upon you again in the
future for advice and counsel as the FBI continuest6j)ursue meanlngfUfengagements with the

Joint Statement of the
American Council on Education, Association of American Universities,
Association of Public and Land-grant Universities and the Council on Governmental Relations

"Scholars or Spies: Foreign Plots Targeting America's Research and Development"
House Science, Space, and Technology Committee Subcommittee on Oversight and
Subcommittee on Research and Technology Hearing
2318 Rayburn House Office Building
April 11, 2018
The global events of recent years and evolving threats to the United States present new security
challenges and require a careful reassessment of our nation's security vulnerabilities, including
those of our colleges and universities. As part of the government-university partnership, U.S.
universities share a responsibility with the federal government to ensure that research conducted
under their auspices contributes to our national defense and homeland security. Each must work to
ensure that the fruits of this research are appropriately secured and protected fi·om outside intrusion
or theft by foreign actors and/or governments.
Together, our four associations represent all major U.S. research universities and higher
education institutions. Our member research universities share a vested interest with the
government in ensuring that intellectual property, proprietary information, trade secrets, sensitive
data, and other classified and/or otherwise controlled government information developed or
housed at our institutions is not susceptible to academic exfiltration, espionage, or exploitation.
Accordingly, we welcome the oppottunity to continue to work constmctively and cooperatively
with Congress and the major national security agencies, including the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the National Security Agency
(NSA), and the Departments of Justice, Homeland Security, State, Defense, Commerce and
govetnment research agencies to protect legitimate national security interests associated with
scientific research conducted at universities.

We greatly appreciate past efforts by the federal government, such as programs launched by the
U.S. Departments of Commerce and State, the FBI, and other security agencies, to engage with
the higher education community and to forge closer relationships between the academic and
security communities both at the local and national levels. The higher education community
values the increased training and outreach efforts undertaken by the Commerce Departmenf s
Bureau of lnclustrv and Sccuritv ( BlS) to help ensure understanding of and compliance with
export control laws. We also appreciate other collaborative initiatives with our associations, such
as the FBrs \\'eanons of .'v1ass Destruction Directorates Chemical-Biolouica! Safetv Pro12:ram.
The Department of Homeland Security's Homeland Sccuritv Academic A(l\·isorv Council
(HSAACl provides another very useful forum to discuss such issues; we urge that HSAAC

136
continue its work as HSAAC is an excellent assembly for increased conversations and
deliberations about the very types of security issues raised at today's hearing.
Campus safety and security programs instituted by the FBI after September II, 2001, including
the Counterterrorism Division's Campus Liaison Ofticer Prouram and the Col!e!lc and

Cniwrsitv Securitv Eft(m, have proven beneficial for cultivating relationships between local FBI
officials, university security personnel, and research administrators. These programs have
allowed the FBI to know who to tum to when they have specific campus-based security concems
and have given our universities a clear point of contact at the Bureau to alert when data breaches
or other potential tlu·cats have been identified on our campuses.
Unfortunately, another useful govemment-university security forum, the FBI" s National Sccurit;
Hi~her Education Board C\SHEB\. which was created by the FBI for high-level university
leaders to engage directly with govcmment security officials and is referenced in the Charter for
this particular hearing, was disbanded in February 2018. The NSHEB served as a useful venue
for the university and security communities to candidly discuss national priorities pertaining to
terrorism, counterintelligence, immigration, and homeland security. The Board also provided a
forum where the higher education and federal security agencies could collaborate to address
important security, scientific, technical, and training issues relating to concerns such as export
controls, cybersecurity, and training needs in technical areas where domestically-trained talent is
essential.
Our associations are disappointed with the decision to disband the NSHEB because we believe it
comes at a time when the very types of discussions the Board enabled between the university
community and federal security agencies could be especially valuable. We are currently seeking
a meeting with FBI leadership to discuss if an altemative forum can be developed to convene
future high-level discussions.
We look forward to continuing the dialogue with the House Commillee on Space, Science, and
Technology conceming how our universities can be even more effective at partnering with
federal research and security agencies to advance the nation's scientific interests while at the
same protecting our national security. We would welcome an opportunity to identify leaders
from the academic community who can speak to what universities are already doing to address
key security concems on our campuses as they relate to the research we conduct on behalf of the
federal government.
