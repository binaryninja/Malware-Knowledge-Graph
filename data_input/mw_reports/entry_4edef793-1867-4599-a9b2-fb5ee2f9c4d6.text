Check Point Researchers have revealed a new and nasty malicious code on Google Play
Store that hides itself inside around 60 game apps, several of which are intended to be used
by children. According to Google Play’s data, the apps has so far been downloaded between
3 million and 7 million times.
How It Works
Dubbed ‘AdultSwine’, these malicious apps wreak havoc in three possible ways:
1. Displaying ads from the web that are often highly inappropriate and pornographic.
2. Attempting to trick users into installing fake ‘security apps’.
3. Inducing users to register to premium services at the user’s expense.
Apart from these current three main activities, the malicious code can use its infrastructure to
broaden its goals to other purposes, such as credential theft.

Figure 1: AdultSwine operation flow
Once the malicious app is installed on the device, it waits for a boot to occur or for a user to
unlock his screen, upon which it initiates its malicious activity.
Illegitimate and Inappropriate Ads
First, the malicious code contacts its Command and Control server (C&C) to report the
successful installation, sends data about the infected device and then receives the
configurations, which determine its course of operation. These configurations instruct it on
whether to hide its icon (to encumber removal), which ads to display, over which apps and on
what terms. It is interesting to note that the server however forbids ads to be displayed over
certain apps such as browsers and social networks, in order to avoid suspicion.
The malicious code then verifies certain conditions regarding the device’s status and checks
which app is currently running on screen. Once all its terms are met, it begins to display the
illegitimate ads outside of the app’s context. If it is embedded inside a web browser app the
ads will be displayed inside that browser, if not they will be displayed inside a designated
web view.
As for the ads being displayed, they come from two main sources; the first is that of the main
ad providers, which forbid such illegitimate display of their ads. The second is the malicious
code’s own ad library, which contains ads of an offensive nature, including pornographic ads.

All these are displayed to children while playing the game that the app is masquerading as.
Below is a mild example of the ads presented and a comment from one of the victims, whose
son had an unfortunate experience.

Google Play
Scareware – Deceptive App Install Tactics
Another course of action the malicious app pursues is scaring
users into installing unnecessary and even harmful “security”
apps.
First, the malicious app displays an ad that claims the user’s
device is infected by a virus. Should the user press the
notification of “Remove Virus Now” he is redirected to an app
in the Google Play Store with a somewhat questionable
connection to virus removal. An experienced eye could easily
foresee this tactic, though a child playing a game app is easy
prey for such nefarious apps.

Registering To Premium Services
Another technique used by the malicious
app is registering to premium services and
charging the victim’s account for
fraudulent premium services they did not
request to send or receive. In a similar way to
the scareware tactic seen above, the malicious
app initially displays a pop-up ad, which
attempts to persuade the user to click through.
This time however, the ad claims that the user is
entitled to win an iPhone by simply answering
four short questions. Should the user answer
them, the malicious code informs the user that
he has been successful, and asks him to enter his phone number to receive the prize. Once
entered, the malicious code then uses this number to register to premium services.

A Comprehensive Threat
Although for now this malicious app seems to be a nasty
nuisance, and most certainly damaging on both an emotional and
financial level, it nevertheless also has a potentially much wider
range of malicious activities that it can pursue, all relying on the
same common concept.
The malicious code simply receives a target link from its
Command and Control server and displays it to the user. While in
some cases this link is merely an advertisement, it could also lead
to whatever social engineering scheme the hacker has in mind.
Indeed, these plots continue to be effective even today, especially
when they originate in apps downloaded from trusted sources
such as Google Play.
