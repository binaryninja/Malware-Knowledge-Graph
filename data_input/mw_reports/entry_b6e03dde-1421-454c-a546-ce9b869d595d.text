Modern Android banking Trojans are created by virus writers and sold for serious
sums as commercial products via underground Internet platforms. However, the
source code of one such malicious application was recently made public on a hacker
forum, along with instructions on how to use it. Doctor Web security researchers
believe that this may lead to a significant increase in the number of attacks involving
Android banking Trojans.
The virus writers published the source code of the new malicious application just one month
ago, but Doctor Web security researchers have already detected an Android Banker that has
been created using the information published by the cybercriminals. This Trojan, dubbed
Android.BankBot.149.origin, is distributed under the guise of benign programs. When a
smartphone or tablet user installs and runs Android.BankBot.149.origin, the banker
prompts the user to grant it administrative privileges to hinder its removal from the system.
After that it hides itself from the user by removing its shortcut from the home screen.

Then Android.BankBot.149.origin connects to the command and control (C&C) server and
awaits instructions. The Trojan can execute the following actions:
send SMS messages;
intercept SMS messages;
request administrator privileges;
send USSD requests;
obtain all contact list phone numbers;
send SMS messages containing the text specified in a command to all contact list
numbers;
track device geolocation via GPS satellites;
request additional permission on devices using the most recent Android versions to
send SMS messages, make calls, and access the contact list and GPS receiver;
receive an executable file containing a list of attacked banking applications;
show phishing dialogs.
Like many other Android bankers, Android.BankBot.149.origin steals confidential user
information by tracking the launch of online banking applications and payment system
software. One sample examined by Doctor Web security researchers controls over three
dozen such programs. Once Android.BankBot.149.origin detects that any of the
aforementioned applications have been launched, it loads the relevant phishing input form to
access user bank account login and password information and displays it on top of the
attacked application.

The Trojan not only steals mobile banking login credentials but also bank card information
belonging to the owner of the compromised device. For this purpose,
Android.BankBot.149.origin tracks the launch of such popular applications as Facebook,
Viber, Youtube, WhatsApp, Uber, Snapchat, WeChat, imo, Instagram, Twitter, and Play Store
and displays a phishing dialog resembling the one used to make purchases on Google Play.

When an SMS message arrives, the Trojan turns off all sounds and vibrations, sends the
message content to the cybercriminals, and attempts to delete the original messages from
the list of incoming SMS. As a result, a user could miss not only bank notifications about the
unplanned transactions but also other incoming messages.
Android.BankBot.149.origin uploads all the stolen data on the C&C server, and it becomes
available on the administration panel. This helps cybercriminals to not only obtain the
information they are interested in but also control the malicious application.

3/5

In general, the possibilities of this Trojan are quite standard for modern Android bankers.
However, as cybercriminals created it with publicly available information, one can anticipate
that many Trojans similar to it will appear. Dr.Web for Android successfully detects
Android.BankBot.149.origin; therefore, this malicious program poses no threat to our
users.
