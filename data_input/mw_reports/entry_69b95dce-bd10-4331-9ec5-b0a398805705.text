#StopRansomware: Ransomware Attacks on Critical
Infrastructure Fund DPRK Malicious Cyber Activities
Summary
Note: This Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) is part of an ongoing #StopRansomware effort
to publish advisories for network defenders that detail various ransomware variants and
various ransomware threat actors. These #StopRansomware advisories detail
historically and recently observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and
indicators of compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect against ransomware. Visit
stopransomware.gov to see all #StopRansomware advisories and to learn about other
ransomware threats and no-cost resources.
The United States National Security Agency (NSA), the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI), the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA),
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Republic of Korea
(ROK) National Intelligence Service (NIS), and the ROK Defense Security Agency
(DSA) (hereafter referred to as the “authoring agencies”) are issuing this joint
Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to highlight ongoing ransomware activity against
Healthcare and Public Health Sector organizations and other critical infrastructure
sector entities.
This CSA provides an overview of Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK)
state-sponsored ransomware and updates the July 6, 2022, joint CSA North Korean
State-Sponsored Cyber Actors Use Maui Ransomware to Target the Healthcare and
Public Health Sector. This advisory highlights TTPs and IOCs DPRK cyber actors used
to gain access to and conduct ransomware attacks against Healthcare and Public
Health (HPH) Sector organizations and other critical infrastructure sector entities, as
well as DPRK cyber actors’ use of cryptocurrency to demand ransoms.

The authoring agencies assess that an unspecified amount of revenue from these
cryptocurrency operations supports DPRK national-level priorities and objectives,
including cyber operations targeting the United States and South Korea governments—
specific targets include Department of Defense Information Networks and Defense
Industrial Base member networks. The IOCs in this product should be useful to sectors
previously targeted by DPRK cyber operations (e.g., U.S. government, Department of
Defense, and Defense Industrial Base). The authoring agencies highly discourage
paying ransoms as doing so does not guarantee files and records will be recovered and
may pose sanctions risks.
For additional information on state-sponsored DPRK malicious cyber activity, see
CISA’s North Korea Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories webpage.
For a downloadable copy of IOCs, see AA23-040A.stix (STIX, 197 kb).
Technical Details
Note: This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise framework, version 12. See
MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise for all referenced tactics and techniques.
This CSA is supplementary to previous reports on malicious cyber actor activities
involving DPRK ransomware campaigns—namely Maui and H0lyGh0st ransomware.
The authoring agencies are issuing this advisory to highlight additional observed TTPs
DPRK cyber actors are using to conduct ransomware attacks targeting South Korean
and U.S. healthcare systems.
Observable TTPs
The TTPs associated with DPRK ransomware attacks include those traditionally
observed in ransomware operations. Additionally, these TTPs span phases from
acquiring and purchasing infrastructure to concealing DPRK affiliation:


Acquire Infrastructure [T1583]. DPRK actors generate domains, personas, and
accounts; and identify cryptocurrency services to conduct their ransomware
operations. Actors procure infrastructure, IP addresses, and domains with
cryptocurrency generated through illicit cybercrime, such as ransomware and
cryptocurrency theft.



Obfuscate Identity. DPRK actors purposely obfuscate their involvement by
operating with or under third-party foreign affiliate identities and use third-party
foreign intermediaries to receive ransom payments.



Purchase VPNs and VPSs [T1583.003]. DPRK cyber actors will also use virtual
private networks (VPNs) and virtual private servers (VPSs) or third-country IP
addresses to appear to be from innocuous locations instead of from DPRK.



Gain Access [TA0001]. Actors use various exploits of common vulnerabilities
and exposures (CVE) to gain access and escalate privileges on networks.
Recently observed CVEs that actors used to gain access include remote code
execution in the Apache Log4j software library (known as Log4Shell) and remote
code execution in unpatched SonicWall SMA 100 appliances [T1190 and T1133].
Observed CVEs used include:
o CVE 2021-44228
o CVE-2021-20038
o CVE-2022-24990

Actors also likely spread malicious code through Trojanized files for “X-Popup,” an open
source messenger commonly used by employees of small and medium hospitals in
South Korea [T1195].
The actors spread malware by leveraging two domains: xpopup.pe[.]kr and
xpopup.com. xpopup.pe[.]kr is registered to IP address 115.68.95[.]128 and
xpopup[.]com is registered to IP address 119.205.197[.]111. Related file names and
hashes are listed in table 1.

Ransomware Attacks on Critical Infrastructure Fund DPRK Malicious Cyber Activities



Move Laterally and Discovery [TA0007, TA0008]. After initial access, DPRK
cyber actors use staged payloads with customized malware to perform
reconnaissance activities, upload and download additional files and executables,
and execute shell commands [T1083, T1021]. The staged malware is also
responsible for collecting victim information and sending it to the remote host
controlled by the actors [TA0010].



Employ Various Ransomware Tools [TA0040]. Actors have used privately
developed ransomware, such as Maui and H0lyGh0st [T1486]. Actors have also
been observed using or possessing publically available tools for encryption, such
as BitLocker, Deadbolt, ech0raix, GonnaCry, Hidden Tear, Jigsaw, LockBit 2.0,
My Little Ransomware, NxRansomware, Ryuk, and YourRansom [T1486]. In
some cases, DPRK actors have portrayed themselves as other ransomware
groups, such as the REvil ransomware group. For IOCs associated with Maui
and H0lyGh0st ransomware usage, please see Appendix B.



Demand Ransom in Cryptocurrency. DPRK cyber actors have been observed
setting ransoms in bitcoin [T1486]. Actors are known to communicate with victims
via Proton Mail email accounts. For private companies in the healthcare sector,
actors may threaten to expose a company’s proprietary data to competitors if
ransoms are not paid. Bitcoin wallet addresses possibly used by DPRK cyber
actors include:

Mitigations
Note: These mitigations align with the Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals
(CPGs) developed by CISA and the U.S. National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that
CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the
CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most
common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. For more

information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections, see
cisa.gov/cpg.
The authoring agencies urge HPH organizations to:
 Limit access to data by authenticating and encrypting connections (e.g., using
public key infrastructure certificates in virtual private network (VPN) and transport
layer security (TLS) connections) with network services, Internet of Things (IoT)
medical devices, and the electronic health record system [CPG 3.3].


Implement the principle of least privilege by using standard user accounts on
internal systems instead of administrative accounts [CPG 1.5], which grant
excessive system administration privileges.



Turn off weak or unnecessary network device management interfaces, such as
Telnet, SSH, Winbox, and HTTP for wide area networks (WANs) and secure with
strong passwords and encryption when enabled.



Protect stored data by masking the permanent account number (PAN) when
displayed and rendering it unreadable when stored—through cryptography, for
example.



Secure the collection, storage, and processing practices for personally
identifiable information (PII)/protected health information (PHI), per regulations
such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).
Implementing HIPAA security measures could prevent the introduction of
malware to the system [CPG 3.4].
o Secure PII/ PHI at collection points and encrypt the data at rest and in transit
using technologies, such as TLS. Only store personal patient data on internal
systems that are protected by firewalls, and ensure extensive backups are
available.
o Create and regularly review internal policies that regulate the collection,
storage, access, and monitoring of PII/PHI.



Implement and enforce multi-layer network segmentation with the most critical
communications and data resting on the most secure and reliable layer [CPG
8.1].



Use monitoring tools to observe whether IoT devices are behaving erratically due
to a compromise [CPG 3.1].

Ransomware Attacks on Critical Infrastructure Fund DPRK Malicious Cyber Activities

In addition, the authoring agencies urge all organizations, including HPH Sector
organizations, to apply the following recommendations to prepare for and mitigate
ransomware incidents:


Maintain isolated backups of data, and regularly test backup and
restoration [CPG 7.3]. These practices safeguard an organization’s continuity of
operations or at least minimize potential downtime from a ransomware incident
and protect against data losses.
o



Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable (i.e., cannot be altered or
deleted), and covers the entire organization’s data infrastructure.

Create, maintain, and exercise a basic cyber incident response plan and
associated communications plan that includes response procedures for a
ransomware incident [CPG 7.1, 7.2].
o Organizations should also ensure their incident response and
communications plans include data breach incidents response and
notification procedures. Ensure the notification procedures adhere to
applicable laws.
o See the CISA-Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MSISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide and CISA Fact Sheet Protecting Sensitive
and Personal Information from Ransomware-Caused Data Breaches for
information on creating a ransomware response checklist and planning
and responding to ransomware-caused data breaches.



Install updates for operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as
they are released [CPG 5.1]. Timely patching is one of the most efficient and
cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to
cybersecurity threats. Regularly check for software updates and end-of-life
notifications and prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities. Consider
leveraging a centralized patch management system to automate and expedite
the process.



If you use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), or other potentially risky
services, secure and monitor them closely [CPG 5.4].
o Limit access to resources over internal networks, especially by restricting
RDP and using virtual desktop infrastructure. After assessing risks, if RDP
is deemed operationally necessary, restrict the originating sources, and
require phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA) to mitigate
credential theft and reuse [CPG 1.3]. If RDP must be available externally,
use a VPN, virtual desktop infrastructure, or other means to authenticate

and secure the connection before allowing RDP to connect to internal
devices. Monitor remote access/RDP logs, enforce account lockouts after
a specified number of attempts to block brute force campaigns, log RDP
login attempts, and disable unused remote access/RDP ports [CPG 1.1,
3.1].
o Ensure devices are properly configured and that security features are
enabled. Disable ports and protocols not in use for a business purpose
(e.g., RDP Transmission Control Protocol port 3389).
o Restrict the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol within the network to
only access necessary servers and remove or disable outdated versions
of SMB (i.e., SMB version 1). Threat actors use SMB to propagate
malware across organizations.
o Review the security posture of third-party vendors and those
interconnected with your organization. Ensure all connections between
third-party vendors and outside software or hardware are monitored and
reviewed for suspicious activity [CPG 5.6, 6.2].
o Implement application control policies that only allow systems to execute
known and permitted programs [CPG 2.1].
o Open document readers in protected viewing modes to help prevent active
content from running.


Implement a user training program and phishing exercises [CPG 4.3] to
raise awareness among users about the risks of visiting websites, clicking on
links, and opening attachments. Reinforce the appropriate user response to
phishing and spearphishing emails.



Require phishing-resistant MFA for as many services as possible [CPG
1.3]—particularly for webmail, VPNs, accounts that access critical systems, and
privileged accounts that manage backups.



Use strong passwords [CPG 1.4] and avoid reusing passwords for multiple
accounts. See CISA Tip Choosing and Protecting Passwords and National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-63B:
Digital Identity Guidelines for more information.



Require administrator credentials to install software [CPG 1.5].



Audit user accounts with administrative or elevated privileges [CPG 1.5]
and configure access controls with least privilege in mind.



Install and regularly update antivirus and antimalware software on all
hosts.



Only use secure networks. Consider installing and using a VPN.



Consider adding an email banner to messages coming from outside your
organizations [CPG 8.3] indicating that they are higher risk messages.



Consider participating in CISA’s no-cost Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS)
program to receive real-time exchange of machine-readable cyber threat
indicators and defensive measures.

If a ransomware incident occurs at your organization:


Follow your organization’s ransomware response checklist.



Scan backups. If possible, scan backup data with an antivirus program to check
that it is free of malware. This should be performed using an isolated, trusted
system to avoid exposing backups to potential compromise.



U.S. organizations: Follow the notification requirements as outlined in your
cyber incident response plan. Report incidents to appropriate authorities; in the
U.S., this would include the FBI at a local FBI Field Office, CISA at
cisa.gov/report, or the U.S. Secret Service (USSS) at a USSS Field Office.



South Korean organizations: Please report incidents to NIS, KISA (Korea
Internet & Security Agency), and KNPA (Korean National Police Agency).

the api.php script and resides on the TNAS device appliances' operating system
where users manage storage, backup data, and configure applications. By exploiting
the script flaw a remote unauthenticated attacker can pass specially crafted data to
the application and execute arbitrary commands on the target system. This may result
in complete compromise of the target system, including the exfiltration of information.
TNAS devices can be chained to acquire unauthenticated remote code execution with
highest privileges.

Ransomware Attacks on Critical Infrastructure Fund DPRK Malicious Cyber Activities

Appendix B: Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
The IOC section includes hashes and IP addresses for the Maui and H0lyGh0st
ransomware variants—as well as custom malware implants assumedly developed by
DPRK cyber actors, such as remote access trojans (RATs), loaders, and other tools—
that enable subsequent deployment of ransomware. For additional Maui IOCs, see joint
CSA North Korean State-Sponsored Cyber Actors Use Maui Ransomware to Target the
Healthcare and Public Health Sector.
Table 2 lists MD5 and SHA256 hashes associated with malware implants, RATs, and
other tools used by DPRK cyber actors, including tools that drop Maui ransomware files.
