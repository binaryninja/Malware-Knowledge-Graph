Emotet Stops Using 0.0.0.0 in Spambot Traffic
Introduction

Brad

Last week, I wrote a diary about Emotet using 0.0.0.0 in its spambot traffic
instead of the actual IP address of the infected Windows host (link).
Shortly after that diary, Emotet changed from using 0.0.0.0 to using the victim's
IP address, but with the octet values listed in reverse order.
Details
During a recent Emotet infection on Tuesday 2022-01-24, my infected Windows
host was using 173.66.46.112 as its source IP. Note that my source IP has
been edited for this diary to sanitize/disguise the actual IP address. See the
image below for DNS traffic representing a possible spam blocklist check by my
infected Windows host. In other malware families like Trickbot, the octet order is
reversed. But order is not reversed for this Emotet infection.

Shown above: Possibly spam blocklist check by my Emotet-infected host on
Tuesday 2022-01-24.
As seen in the above image, the following DNS queries were made:
173.66.46.112spam.abuse.ch
173.66.46.112.b.barracudacentral.org
173.66.46.112.bl.mailspike.net
173.66.46.112.spam.dnsbl.sorbs.net
173.66.46.112.zen.spamhaus.org
Again, I normally see the octet order reversed with other malware like Trickbot.
This reversed order also appeared during SMTP traffic with the command ELHO
[112.46.66.173] as shown below.

Shown above: Victim IP address in Emotet spambot traffic on Tuesday 202201-24.
Twitter discussion for last week's diary indicates Emotet developers may have
broken something in the spambot module to produce the previous 0.0.0.0
traffic. I'm not sure if this new traffic--the reversed order of the victim's IP
address--is intentional or not.
