exchange, and then loads a legitimate cryptocurrency trading platform with no signs of malicious activity.
"JMTTrader.exe" is similar in appearance to version 1 and QT Bitcoin Trader. In addition to similar appearance, many strings found in "JMTTrader
Trader references and parameters being set to “JMT Trader” including but not limited to:
--Begin similarities-String_ABOUT_QT_BITCOIN_TRADER_TEXT=JMT Trader
String_ABOUT_QT_BITCOIN_TRADER_TEXT=JMT Trader is a free Open Source project<br>developed on pure C++ Qt and OpenSSL.
QtBitcoinTraderClass
July IGHOR (note: Ighor July is one of the developers of QT Bitcoin Trader)

GitHub repository under the name Gary Mendez “github.com/garymendez/JMTTrader/issues."
While the JMTTrader application is likely a modification of QT Bitcoin Trader, the legitimate QT Bitcoin Trader for Windows is not available for dow
only as a Windows portable executable. This is a singular file named "QtBitcoinTrader.exe" and does not install or run any additional programs. Th
contains "JMTTrader.exe," the modified version of QT Bitcoin Trader, as well as the additional "CrashReporter.exe"

Description

This file is a 32-bit Windows executable contained within the Windows MSI Installer "JMTTrader_Win.msi." Unlike the first version of the malware,
installed in the “C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\JMTTrader," which is a different folder than "JMTTrader.exe." "CrashReporter.exe" is he
ADVObfuscation library, which has been renamed “snowman” by the malware writer. ADVObfuscation is described as using C++ 11/14 language
time, obfuscated code without using any external tool and without modifying the compiler and introduces some form of randomness to generate p
encryption of strings literals and the obfuscation of calls using finite state machines. Due to this obfuscation, detailed functionality can be difficult t
of the non-obfuscated "Updater.exe" binary.
At launch, "CrashReporter.exe" first checks for the “Maintain” parameter and if not found, exits the program to likely evade detection in a sandbox
malware collects basic victim information and encrypts the data with the hardcoded XOR key “X,%`PMk--Jj8s+6=15:20:11."
The encrypted data is sent to “hxxps[:]//beastgoc.com/grepmonux.php” with a multipart form data separator “--wMKBUqjC7ZMG5A5g."
The malware’s capabilities include reading/writing itself to various directories, querying/writing to the registry, searching for files, extract/decode pa
processes. "CrashReporter.exe" also creates a scheduled SYSTEM task named "JMTCrashReporter," which runs the "CrashReporter.exe" progra
parameter at the login of any user.

Description

This OSX sample was contained within Apple DMG Installer "JMTTrader_Mac.dmg." CrashReporter likely functions very similarly to the Windows
program, but unlike the Windows program, it is not obfuscated. This lack of obfuscation makes it easier to determine the program’s functionality in
Upon launch, the malware checks for the “Maintain” parameter, and will exit if the parameter is not found, likely to avoid sandbox analysis.

CrashReporter then creates a randomly generated token (identifier) and collects the binary’s version and process ID to send to the server. This da
with the hard-coded key “X,%`PMk--Jj8s+6=\x02” (last value is a non-printable ASCII character which is hexadecimal \x02). While the key is differ
the Windows sample, the first 16 bytes are the same.
The encrypted data is sent to the same C2 server as the Windows sample at hxxps[:]//beastgoc.com/grepmonux.php with the multipart data form
“jGzAcN6k4VsTRn9”. CrashReporter also has a hard-coded user-agent string: “Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36
Chrome/72.0.3626.121 Safari/537.36” along with other hard-coded values sent with the data including “token," “query," and “mont.jpg."
If CrashReporter receives a response with the HTTP code 200 (successful), it will invoke another function which will wait for tasking from the C2 s
received, the function decrypts the data with the same hardcoded XOR key and processes the tasking. Accepted tasking commands include the f
--Begin accepted tasking commands-“exit”: this command will cause CrashReporter to gracefully exit
“up”: this command will upload a file from the C2 server to the infected host
“stand ”: this command will execute commands from the server via the shell using the popen API (the "popen()" function opens a process by creat
forking, and invoking the shell)
--End accepted tasking commands-These possible commands from the C2 server gives the remote attacker full control over the OSX system. It is likely that the functionality of the W
CrashReporter.exe is the same as this OSX malware, as the original AppleJeus had the same functionality on both operating systems.

Conclusion
Soon after October 11, 2019, the files on GitHub were updated to clean, non-malicious installers. Then on October 13, 2019, a different cyber sec
published an article detailing the OSX JMTTrader, and soon after the C2 "beastgoc.com" went offline. There is not a confirmed sample of the payl
point.

Recommendations
CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organizatio
configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.
Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.
Keep operating system patches up-to-date.
Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.
Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unl
Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.
Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.
Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.
Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.
Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file
Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.
Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).
Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.
Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).
