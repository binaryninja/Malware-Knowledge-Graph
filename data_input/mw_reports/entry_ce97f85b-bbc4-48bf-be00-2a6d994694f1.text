Notable Droppers Emerge in Recent Threat Campaigns

July 7, 2022

Droppers are malicious files that deploy malware payloads to a victim's device, and are used
in many threat campaigns. During the second quarter of 2022, FortiGuard Labs observed
some active droppers, including Microsoft Excel files, as well as Windows shortcut files and
ISO image files. We captured these samples from phishing emails that were combined with
social engineering to trick victims into loading the malware onto their devices. Recently, we
found common malware families involving these samples to be Emotet, Qbot, and Icedid. In
addition, a malware called Bumblebee, a previously rarely observed malware loader, was
also found in some ISO files.
This blog reveals how droppers are delivered to a victim's device and how they drop malware
payloads onto the victim's local disk.

Affected Platforms: Microsoft Windows
Impacted Users: Windows users
Impact: Controls victim's device and collects sensitive information, plus delivers other
malware
Severity Level: Critical

Malicious Files Delivered Via Phishing Email
The droppers are spread through phishing emails in three ways. An email may:
Contain the dropper or a password-protected ZIP as an attachment
Contain an HTML file attachment that extracts a dropper when opened
Have a link to download the dropper in the body of the email
Each way delivers the malicious file to victims and tricks them into opening it. See the
examples below.
Figure 1: Email with a password-protected ZIP archive attachment
Figure 2: Email with an HTML file attachment
Figure 3: Email with a malicious download link
We observed the attached HTML file and the webpage of the download link use a technique
called HTML smuggling, which leverages legitimate HTML5 and JavaScript features to
encode the malicious data. As shown in Figure 4, The HTML smuggling file converts the blob
data into a dropper when opened in the web browser.

The first observation was in May. The download link in the email pointed to a web page
containing HTML smuggling. By June, the HTML smuggling file was sent directly to victims
as an HTML attachment.

Analyzing the Droppers and Their Behaviors
This quarter, we captured three different samples active in the threat campaign. The first
sample is an Excel file with Excel 4.0 macros. The second is an LNK file (Windows shortcut
file). The third sample is an ISO file (optical disk image).

Excel file with Excel 4.0 macros
This Excel sample is not new. It has been heavily used in Emotet campaigns since last year,
as mentioned in the previous blog. Some sheets of this sample are hidden, as shown in
Figure 5, including an Excel 4.0 macro sheet "IJEIGOPSAGHSPHP" that contains the

malicious formulas. Cell A1 in this macro sheet is named
"Auto_Open9939689536899569357795948589489469636486898953895396378943986"
and includes a built-in macro that automatically runs the formula from that cell once the file is
opened.
This macro sheet includes formulas that call the API "URLDownloadToFileA" to download the
malware payloads from several different URLs. The malware payloads are actually DLL files
and executed using "regsvr32.exe".

LNK file
A Windows shortcut file (commonly referred to as LNK) is created to point to a specific
target. Double-clicking on the shortcut file will execute the target.
As shown in Figure 6, this sample includes a PowerShell code snippet in its target field. The
PowerShell code converts a base64 string into a script that contains multiple URLs to
download the malware payload. Next, it attempts to download the malware payload from
each URL and execute it with "Regsvr32.exe" until it succeeds.

We also captured other samples containing different malicious code in their target field. As
shown in Figure 7, there is a command line to download a malware payload from a URL and
execute it with "Regsvr32.exe".
Figure 7: The malicious code in the target field of captured sample
Figure 8 shows another malicious PowerShell code in the target field. The data is decoded to
a .hta URL and executed using "mshta.exe". Next, the VBScript code in the web page of the
.hta URL extracts a PowerShell code that includes encrypted data. In the end, the encrypted
data is transformed into script code to get the payload URL and download malware.

All three examples above download and execute a malware payload, despite the differences.

ISO file
An ISO file (often called an ISO image), is an archive file that stores the contents of a
physical disk. In Windows 10, opening an ISO file by double-clicking it mounts the file on a
virtual optical disc drive. Once mounted, the contents of an ISO file can be accessed in File
Explorer.

Threat actors store a malware DLL file and a malicious LNK file in the ISO file. As shown in
Figure 9, the DLL file is set to a hidden attribute, so it is not visible in File Explorer by default.
On the other hand, the shortcut file is used to execute the DLL file using "Rundll32.exe".

Conclusion
In recent threat campaigns, all droppers mentioned in the previous section are very active
and used by more than one malware family. Below is the malware payload of each captured
dropper.

Figure 10 shows the notable malware activities during the past three-month period. In early
April, Microsoft Excel files were the only file type used to spread malware. We then captured
a shortcut file with the Emotet malware payload, which first appeared on April 23. This new
malware attack technique was soon followed by Qbot and Icedid, spreading using shortcut
files as well in early May. Later, ISO files for droppers began appearing in the middle of May,
and the malware families involved included Qbot, Icedid, and Bumblebee. Next, HTML
smuggling attacks emerged in late May and June, including web pages and HTML file
attachments. This builds malware locally instead of delivering malicious files directly through
the network to bypass the firewall.

Microsoft Office files have been a favorite vehicle for threat actors because of the macros.
However, things seem to be changing as Microsoft has added more security controls in
Office files with macros. In July of 2021, Microsoft disabled Excel 4.0 macros by default when
opening an Excel file. In early April 2022, Microsoft created another setting to block VBA
macros in files from the internet by default. With more restrictions on the use of macros for
Microsoft Office files, threat actors turn to other types of files to increase compromise rates.
At this point, shortcut files provide a solid option due to double-click execution. ISO files can
be automatically mounted and opened on modern versions of Windows with just a double
click. In addition, ISO files take advantage of bypassing the Mark-of-the-Web trust control,

making them easier to evade antivirus detection than other archive files. The HTML
smuggling technique creates malicious files locally to bypass the restrictions on receiving
files from the internet and emails. This explains the proliferation of shortcut files and ISO
files, as well as HTML smuggling used for malware deployment at this time.

The FortiPhish Phishing Simulation Service uses real-world simulations to help organizations
test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper
practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks.
We also suggest that organizations have their end users go through our FREE NSE
training: NSE 1 – Information Security Awareness. It includes a module on internet threats to
train end users on how to identify and protect themselves from phishing attacks.
