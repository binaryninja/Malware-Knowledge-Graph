CVE-2022-26143: TP240PhoneHome Reflection/Amplification DDoS Attack Vector

Executive summary
A new reflection/amplification distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) vector with a recordbreaking potential amplification ratio of 4,294,967,296:1 has been abused by attackers
in the wild to launch multiple high-impact DDoS attacks.
Security researchers, network operators, and security vendors observed these attacks
and formed a task force to investigate the new DDoS vector and provide mitigation
guidance.
Approximately 2,600 Mitel MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration
systems acting as PBX-to-internet gateways were incorrectly deployed with an
abusable system test facility exposed to the public internet.
Attackers were actively leveraging these systems to launch reflection/amplification
DDoS attacks of more than 53 million packets per second (Mpps). With optimal attack
tuning, the potential traffic yield for this DDoS vector is significantly higher.
Attacks have been observed on broadband access ISPs, financial institutions, logistics
companies, gaming companies, and organizations in other vertical markets.
The attacks can be mitigated using standard DDoS-defense techniques.
Mitel has released patched software that disables the abusable test facility, and is
actively engaged in remediation efforts with their customers.
Research and mitigation task force contributors include Akamai SIRT, Cloudflare,
Lumen Black Lotus Labs, Mitel, NETSCOUT Arbor ASERT, TELUS, Team Cymru, and
The Shadowserver Foundation.

Introduction
Beginning in mid-February 2022, security researchers, network operators, and security
vendors observed a spike in DDoS attacks sourced from UDP port 10074 targeting
broadband access ISPs, financial institutions, logistics companies, and organizations in other
vertical markets.
Upon further investigation, it was determined that the devices abused to launch these attacks
are MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems produced by which
incorporate TP-240 VoIP-processing interface cards and supporting software; their primary
function is to provide internet-based site-to-site voice connectivity for PBX systems.
1/7

Approximately 2600 of these systems have been incorrectly provisioned so that an
unauthenticated system test facility has been inadvertently exposed to the public internet,
allowing attackers to leverage these PBX VoIP gateways as DDoS reflectors/amplifiers.
Mitel is aware that these systems are being abused to facilitate high-pps DDoS attacks, and
have been actively working with customers to remediate abusable devices with patched
software that disables public access to the system test facility.
In this blog, we will further explore the observed activity, explain how the driver has been
abused, and share recommended mitigation steps. This research was created cooperatively
among a team of researchers from Akamai SIRT, Cloudflare, Lumen Black Lotus Labs,
NETSCOUT Arbor ASERT , TELUS, Team Cymru, and The Shadowserver Foundation.

DDoS attacks in the wild
While spikes of network traffic associated with the vulnerable service were observed on
January 8 and February 7, 2022, we believe the first actual attacks leveraging the exploit
began on February 18.
Observed attacks were primarily predicated on pps, or throughput, and appeared to be UDP
reflection/amplification attacks sourced from UDP/10074 that were mainly directed toward
destination ports UDP/80 and UDP/443. The single largest observed attack of this type
preceding this one was approximately 53 Mpps and 23 Gbps. The average packet size for
that attack was approximately 60 bytes, with an attack duration of approximately 5 minutes.
The amplified attack packets are not fragmented.
This particular attack vector differs from most UDP reflection/amplification attack
methodologies in that the exposed system test facility can be abused to launch a sustained
DDoS attack of up to 14 hours in duration by means of a single spoofed attack initiation
packet, resulting in a record-setting packet amplification ratio of 4,294,967,296:1. A
controlled test of this DDoS attack vector yielded more than 400 Mpps of sustained DDoS
attack traffic.
It should be noted that this single-packet attack initiation capability has the effect of
precluding network operator traceback of the spoofed attack initiator traffic. This helps mask
the attack traffic generation infrastructure, making it less likely that the attack origin can be
traced compared with other UDP reflection/amplification DDoS attack vectors.

Abusing the tp240dvr driver
The abused service on affected Mitel systems is called tp240dvr (“TP-240 driver”) and
appears to run as a software bridge to facilitate interactions with TDM/VoIP PCI interface
cards. The service listens for commands on UDP/10074 and is not meant to be exposed to

2/7

the internet, as confirmed by the manufacturer of these devices. It is this exposure to the
internet that ultimately allows it to be abused.
The tp240dvr service exposes an unusual command that is designed to stress test its clients
in order to facilitate debugging and performance testing. This command can be abused to
cause the tp240dvr service to send this stress test to attack victims. The traffic consists of a
high rate of short informative status update packets that can potentially overwhelm victims
and cause the DDoS scenario.
This command can also be abused by attackers to launch very high-throughput attacks.
Attackers can use specially crafted commands to cause the tp240dvr service to send larger
informative status update packets, significantly increasing the amplification ratio.
By extensively testing isolated virtual TP-240–based systems in a lab setting, researchers
were able to cause these devices to generate massive amounts of traffic in response to
comparatively small request payloads. We will cover this attack scenario in greater technical
depth in the following sections.

Calculating the potential attack impact
As previously mentioned, amplification via this abusable test facility differs substantially from
how it is accomplished with most other UDP reflection/amplification DDoS vectors. Typically,
reflection/amplification attacks require the attacker to continuously transmit malicious
payloads to abusable nodes for as long as they wish to attack the victim. In the case of TP240 reflection/amplification, this continuous transmission is not necessary to launch highimpact DDoS attacks.
Instead, an attacker leveraging TP-240 reflection/amplification can launch a high-impact
DDoS attack using a single packet. Examination of the tp240dvr binary reveals that, due to
its design, an attacker can theoretically cause the service to emit 2,147,483,647 responses
to a single malicious command. Each response generates two packets on the wire, leading
to approximately 4,294,967,294 amplified attack packets being directed toward the attack
victim.
For each response to a command, the first packet contains a counter that increments with
each sent response. As the counter value increments, the size of this first packet will grow
from 36 bytes to 45 bytes. The second packet contains diagnostic output from the function,
which can be influenced by the attacker. By optimizing each initiator packet to maximize the
size of the second packet, every command will result in amplified packets that are up to
1,184 bytes in length.
In theory, a single abusable node generating the upper limit of 4,294,967,294 packets at a
rate of 80 thousand packets per second (Kpps) would result in an attack duration of roughly
14 hours. Over the course of the attack, the “counter” packets alone would generate roughly

3/7

95.5 GB of amplified attack traffic destined for the targeted network. The maximally padded
“diagnostic output” packets would account for an additional 2.5 TB of attack traffic directed
toward the target.
This would yield a sustained flood of just under 393 Mbps of attack traffic from a single
reflector/amplifier, all resulting from a single spoofed attack initiator packet of only 1,119
bytes in length. This results in a nearly unimaginable amplification ratio of 2,200,288,816:1
— a multiplier of 220 billion percent, triggered by a single packet.

Upper boundaries of attack volume and simultaneity
The tp240dvr service processes commands using a single thread. This means they can only
process a single command at a time, and thus can only be used to launch one attack at a
time. In the example scenario presented above, during the 14 hours that the abused device
would be attacking the target, it cannot be leveraged to attack any other target. This is
somewhat unique in the context of DDoS reflection/amplification vectors.
Although this characteristic also causes the tp240dvr service to be unavailable to legitimate
users, it is much preferable to having these devices be leveraged in parallel by multiple
attackers — and leaving legitimate operators of these systems to wonder why their outbound
internet data capacity is being consumed at much higher rates.
Additionally, it appears these devices are on relatively low-powered hardware in terms of
their traffic-generation capabilities. On an internet where 100 Gbps links, dozens of CPU
cores, and multithreading capabilities have become commonplace, we can all be thankful
this abusable service is not found on top-of-the-line hardware platforms capable of
individually generating Mpps, and running with thousands of parallelized threads.
Lastly, it is also good news that of the tens of thousands of these devices that have been
purchased and deployed historically by governments, commercial enterprises, and other
organizations worldwide, a relatively small number of them have been configured in a
manner that leaves them in this abusable state, and of those, many have been properly
secured and taken offline from an attacker’s perspective.

Collateral impact
The collateral impact of TP-240 reflection/amplification attacks is potentially significant for
organizations with internet-exposed Mitel MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express
collaboration systems that are abused as DDoS reflectors/amplifiers.
This may include partial or full interruption of voice communications through these systems,
as well as additional service disruption due to transit capacity consumption, state-table
exhaustion of network address translations, stateful firewalls, and so forth.

4/7

Wholesale filtering of all UDP/10074-sourced traffic by network operators may potentially
overblock legitimate internet traffic, and is therefore contraindicated.
During the testing and research phases, an UTRS participant network got hit with an attack
and used UTRS to successfully mitigate the attack. The corresponding network graphs are a
dramatic testament to the success of UTRS.

Recommended actions
TP-240 reflection/amplification DDoS attacks are sourced from UDP/10074 and destined for
the UDP port of the attacker’s choice. This amplified attack traffic can be detected, classified,
traced back, and safely mitigated using standard DDoS defense tools and techniques.
Flow telemetry and packet capture via open-source and commercial analysis systems can
alert network operators and end customers of TP-240 reflection/amplification attacks.
Network access control lists (ACLs), flowspec, destination-based remotely triggered
blackhole, source-based remotely triggered blackhole, and intelligent DDoS mitigation
systems can be used to mitigate these attacks.
Network operators should perform reconnaissance to identify and facilitate remediation of
abusable TP-240 reflectors/amplifiers on their networks and/or the networks of their
customers. Operators of Mitel MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express collaboration
systems should proactively contact Mitel to receive specific remediation instructions from the
vendor.
Organizations with business-critical public-facing internet properties should ensure that all
relevant network infrastructure, architectural, and operational best current practices (BCPs)
have been implemented, including situationally specific network access policies that only
permit internet traffic via required IP protocols and ports. Internet access network traffic
to/from internal organizational personnel should be isolated from internet traffic to/from
public-facing internet properties, and served via separate upstream internet transit links.
DDoS defenses for all public-facing internet properties and supporting infrastructure should
be implemented in a situationally appropriate manner, including periodic testing to ensure
that any changes to the organization’s servers/services/applications are incorporated into its
DDoS-defense plan.
It is imperative that organizations operating mission-critical public-facing internet properties
and/or infrastructure ensure that all servers/services/application/datastores/infrastructure
elements are protected against DDoS attack, and are included in periodic, realistic tests of
the organization’s DDoS mitigation plan. Critical ancillary supporting services such as
authoritative and recursive DNS servers must be included in this plan.
5/7

Network operators should implement ingress and egress source address validation in order
to prevent attackers from initiating reflection/amplification DDoS attacks.
All potential DDoS attack mitigation measures described in this document MUST be tested
and customized in a situationally appropriate manner prior to deployment on production
networks.

Mitigating factors
Operators of internet-exposed TP-240–based Mitel MiCollab and MiVoice Business Express
collaboration systems can prevent abuse of their systems to launch DDoS attacks by
blocking incoming internet traffic destined for UDP/10074 via ACLs, firewall rules, and other
standard network access control policy enforcement mechanisms.
Mitel has provided patched software versions that prevent TP-240–equipped MiCollab and
MiVoice Business Express collaboration systems from being abused as DDoS
reflectors/amplifiers by preventing exposure of the service to the internet. Mitel customers
should contact the vendor for remediation instructions.
Collateral impact to abusable TP-240 reflectors/amplifiers can alert network operators and/or
end customers to remove affected systems from “demilitarized zone” networks or internet
data centers or to disable relevant UDP port–forwarding rules that allow specific UDP/10074
traffic sourced from the public internet to reach these devices, thereby preventing them from
being abused to launch reflection/amplification DDoS attacks.
The amplified attack traffic is not fragmented, so there is no additional attack component
consisting of non initial fragments, as is the case with many other UDP
reflection/amplification DDoS vectors.
Implementation of ingress and egress source-address validation (SAV; also known as antispoofing) can prevent attackers from launching reflection/amplification DDoS attacks.

Conclusion
Unfortunately, many abusable services that should not be exposed to the public internet are
nevertheless left open for attackers to exploit. This scenario is yet another example of realworld deployments that do not adhere to vendor guidance. Vendors can prevent this situation
by adopting “safe by default” postures on devices before shipping.
Reflection/amplification DDoS attacks would be impossible to launch if all network operators
implemented ingress and egress SAV (or anti-spoofing). The ability to spoof the IP
address(es) of the intended attack target(s) is required to launch such attacks. Service
providers must continue to implement SAV in their own networks, and require that their
downstream customers do so as well.

6/7

As is routinely the case with newer DDoS attack vectors, it appears that after an initial period
of employment by advanced attackers with access to bespoke DDoS attack infrastructure,
TP-240 reflection/amplification has been weaponized and added to the arsenals of so-called
“booter/stresser” DDoS-for-hire services, placing it within the reach of the general attacker
population.
Collaboration across the operational, research, and vendor communities is central to the
continued viability of the internet. The quick response to and ongoing remediation of this
high-impact DDoS attack vector has only been possible as a result of such collaboration.
Organizations with a vested interest in the stability and resiliency of the internet should
embrace and support cross-industry cooperative efforts as a core principle.
The combined efforts of the research and mitigation task force demonstrates that successful
collaboration across industry peers to quickly remediate threats to availability and resiliency
is not only possible, but is also increasingly critical for the continued viability of the global
internet.
