Schemes and Evolve in Marketing

August 25, 2020

An average ransomware payment now equals $178,254, which is +60% from Q1 2020. The
sum has grown not only because of the continually increasing activity of ransomware
operators, but also due to their efforts in finding new ways of monetizing their malicious
activities and threatening victims. These new TTPs include:
Stealing data and requesting double ransoms;
Collaborating with other ransomware gangs;
Using stolen data to attack other victims;
Selling stolen data on auctions;
Notifying media, as well as victims’ partners and clients about leaks;
Scraping credit cards.
Novel tactics were adopted not only by infamous gangs such as Maze and Sodinokibi
(REvil), but also by less-popular runner-ups, such as Netwalker, Ragnar Locker, Ako, and
others.
KELA is regularly monitoring these ransomware gangs’ blogs and observes an average of
10-20 new victims each week – implying that the actual number of victims can be much
higher since we’re only seeing the victims who did not pay a ransom. In addition, there are
those who cooperated with cybercriminals and therefore did not appear in the blogs.
The following piece will focus on how the ransomware operators diversify their schemes and
implement so-called “marketing efforts,” related to threatening victims, in order to gain more
profits.

One Ransom Is Not Enough
During the year 2020, it became clear that more and more ransomware gangs prefer to
steal the data before encrypting it, to use it as leverage in ransom negotiations. This
activity includes outing some victims in specially-created blogs, as recently seen being done
by developers of the Avaddon ransomware or by those of Darkside – a rather new
ransomware in the game.

This tactic stems from the variety of the extortion activities used by various cybercriminal
groups in the past. For example, the notorious hacking group known as The Dark Overlord
(TDO) had been hacking companies and stealing their data from 2016 till 2019. TDO’s
victims included Netflix, ABC, Disney, and other prominent organizations – a lot of their data
was leaked or sold after the companies refused to pay a ransom. Moreover, TDO was
terrorizing US schools with various threats using a list of phone numbers for students,
teachers, and school staffers. The group stopped its activity in 2019 but the extortion never
stopped.
A pioneer of the naming-and-shaming tactic is the Snatch team, which manages the
ransomware of the same name. In May 2019, the group went public with customer data
belonging to German IT company, Citycomp, which further exposed data related to BT,
Ericsson, Hugo Boss, and SAP. The gang created a website and released the data when
Citycomp did not succumb to blackmail; later, the group published additional breaches. Now,
the Snatch gang doesn’t seem to be active in terms of intimidating the victims through their
blog, but it’s still actively attacking organizations and encrypting files. However, other
ransomware gangs picked up the tactic.
In November 2019, the Maze team was observed making one of the first public double
extortion cases affecting Allied Universal. After the company refused to pay, the Maze team
published 700 MB worth of data and files stolen from the company, as well as demanded a
new ransom that was 50% higher than the original one.
Per our research, ransomware gangs, that are actively continuing to leak files on their blogs
(meaning that they updated their websites at least once in the last two months), include*:
Ako
Avaddon
Clop
Darkside
Dopplepaymer
Maze
Nefilim
Netwalker
Pysa
Ragnar Locker
Sekhmet
Sodinokibi (REvil)
*On the same day when this research was published, two more ransomware gangs
announced that they started their blogs – Conti and SunCrypt.

These ransomware strains include both exclusively managed ransomware and RaaS
(Ransomware-as-a-Service) type, which involves cooperating with initial access brokers for
initiating attacks and affiliates for performing them. The mentioned ransomware gangs have
different targets across different sectors and utilize very different TTPs. For example,
Sodinokibi uses mostly RDP compromise in conjunction with email phishing and software
vulnerabilities, while Maze relies on phishing attacks as its main infection vector.
So how is all this activity connected to double ransoms? It appears that certain
ransomware gangs from this list are now asking two separate ransoms: one for
decrypting the files and another one for deleting the leaked data. For example, it was
mentioned when the Maze group offered discounts amid coronavirus: “Discounts are offered
for both decrypting files and deleting of the leaked data.”
Some other ransomware gangs specified it in their blogs. For instance, Ragnar Locker
described such an offer in a post of one of the victims: “We made an offer for decryption and
to delete all downloaded information without posting.” Ako also stated about one of the
victims: “Got only payment for decrypt – 350,000$. Payment for delete stolen files was not
received.”

The most recent example is a case of Blackbaud, a provider of software and cloud hosting
solutions. The company managed to stop the attack and prevent encrypting of its files,
though it still had to pay ransom for deleting the data that the ransomware operators
managed to steal (it’s not clear what ransomware was used in the attack). Thus, the
exfiltration of data is becoming a more profitable business model for ransomware
operators, rather than just encrypting files.
As 14 ransomware gangs are now stealing data and publishing it in their blogs, we can
assume that more ransomware operators will adopt the tactic and will require double
ransoms. Possibly, some of them, specifically small-scale operations, will not create their
own blogs, but rather collaborate with other gangs. This way they can make use of the stolen
information and gain profit even if a victim refuses to pay; and this is the next rising trend.

Collaborate and Intimidate

4/14

Drug cartels are old news; instead, ransomware cartels are intending to receive more
prominent attention nowadays. Again, an innovator in this field is the Maze ransomware
gang which formed the “Maze cartel” to publish leaks of other ransomware groups.
On June 2, 2020, Maze announced a new collaboration between this group and the LockBit
ransomware team by adding files on a new victim as “provided by LockBit” and under the
label of “Maze Cartel”. This data was stolen during the attack on international architectural
firm Smith Group – an attack that had actually been performed by the actors behind LockBit
who do not maintain their own blog.

Maze website

When answering a request from reporters, the Maze operators confirmed that they were
working with LockBit and added that another ransomware group would be joining this
cooperation in a few days. This “other” group turned out to be Ragnar Locker, first
discovered in December 2019 and, among other reasons, known for its attack on the
Portuguese multinational energy giant Energias de Portugal (EDP).

So, on June 8, 2020, Maze published another breach under the “Maze Cartel” label on their
blog, while the information already appeared a month earlier on Ragnar’s blog. The leaked
data belonged to marketing firm M.J. Brunner Inc, and BhiveLab – a marketing innovation
lab, launched by M.J. Brunner; in addition, the same post featured their client SEI
Investments, though it was breached separately (it will be discussed in the following sections
of this post).

Maze website

Moreover, RagnarLocker and Maze proceed to exchange the data. On June 12, 2020, the
RagnarLocker group published files belonging to ST Engineering, previously breached by
Maze, on its blog and stated that the leak was “provided by Maze”, making this collaboration
two-sided. Specifically, the published data belonged to a subsidiary company, called VT San
Antonio Aerospace, which provides aerospace services. As Maze revealed later, the
company denied negotiations.

Ragnar Locker website

It is not known if Maze used financial motivation to attract these two ransomware gangs to its
cartel. Since Ragnar Locker did not only provide the data, but also shared some of Maze’s
data in its blog, we can assume that this cooperation is not about a vendor-buyer
relationship, where Maze could “buy out” victims as some sort of a collecting agency.
Possible financial cooperation can be related to sharing a ransom payment if the outed victim
still decides to pay to prevent further leakage of the data, intimidated by joint activities of the
ransomware operators. If the ransom is not paid, the ransomware gangs could likely share
profits if they sell the stolen data on underground forums.
However, based on the fact that these cooperation efforts were spotted over a month ago
and we did not see any new postings, we can assume that “Cartel” was just another
marketing effort for ransomware gangs. It means that threat actors behind the
ransomware decided to jointly promote the leaks in order to intimidate victims, but it
is hardly possible that they collaborated in terms of further monetizing the stolen
data.
This assumption is supported by the fact that there is no evidence of any actual real
cooperation on the backend of things. For example, though LockBit doesn’t have its own
blog, it still maintains an independent profile on forums which is being used for affiliate

recruitment. In its turn, Ragnar Locker’s blog is still online and was updated with three new
victims to their site without any of Maze’s help. Between Ragnar Locker and LockBit, we did
not notice any signs of cooperation as well.
Sodinokibi, known as another experimenter in the ransomware scene (it also remains to be
the most common ransomware (while Maze has the second place in terms of activity), was
not spotted using this tactic. Probably, it is related to the fact it does not need additional
promotion of its victims since it already has a big enough name with its GandCrab legacy.
GandCrab was a ransomware operation that shut down in 2019 and was found to have many
similarities with the Sodinokibi ransomware. The Sodinokibi developers claimed they were
affiliates of GandCrab and obtained the ransomware’s source code.
Though threat actors behind Sodinokibi were really active at the start, spotted
communicating on forums and even leaking victims’ data, they significantly cut their
presence on the forums after establishing the blog. Now they only continue to regularly
recruit affiliates, though the developers are quite picky: they prioritize teams with experience
and accesses to networks.

User UNKN, which is considered to be Sodinokibi’s representative on a Russian-speaking underground
forum, is looking for affiliates

Like its closest (though still far behind) rival Maze, Sodinokibi also implemented new tactics.
For example, recently they were spotted in the campaign scanning the networks of victims to
scrape for credit card and point of sale (PoS) software. There are two possible reasons why
Sodinokibi were looking for PoS software. First, in an attempt to scrape credit card data and
then to use compromised cards or sell it to other cybercriminals. Second – just for encrypting
the PoS software as part of their attacks. Since this tactic is unclear and was not used by
other ransomware, it is hard to be considered a trend, though Sodinokibi has a bunch of
tricks on which we will elaborate further. However, there is another TTP related to
collaboration that needs to be explored prior to that.

Using Stolen Data to Attack Others
As was mentioned when Maze published data provided by Ragnar Locker, another company,
not mentioned in the original post, was featured among the victims. It was SEI Investments
Company, which appears to be a client of BHiveLab, as stated in the media: “Clients using
the new practice include Mars, SEI Investments and GlaxoSmithKline.”
Back at that time, it was not clear whether SEI was attacked separately, or if the Maze
operators simply noticed the company’s files in already stolen data from BHiveLab and M.J.
Brunner and highlighted it as a marketing lure. However, after a few days, Maze clarified this
victim in its “official press release”, containing recommendations to refrain from working with
negotiators or decrypting files on one’s own after suffering the ransomware attack.

Maze website

At the end of the press release, Maze mentioned that its member breached SEI Investments
company using information previously stolen from BHiveLab and M.J. Brunner. This implies
another vector in ransomware gangs’ cooperation and another threat to all ecosystems
around breached companies.
Companies that suffer ransomware attacks must also be wary of the potential impact it has
on their vendors, clients, or other partners. The related parties immediately become
vulnerable to an attack as well – not just because of the leaked mutual data, but also
because of potential compromise in the future. Maze stated it quite clearly in one of their
press releases (from April 17, 2020; screenshot provided below): “We will use the information
gotten to attack your clients and partners.”

We expect this trend growing, as ransomware gangs become more sophisticated and
capable of analyzing the stolen information not just from the focus of releasing and selling
data, but also with the intention of finding new initial attack vectors.

We Will Auction Your Data and Notify Your Partners
Modern ransomware gangs do not just use cartels to intimidate victims – they also invent
new threats on their own.
In June 2020, the Sodinokibi operators launched a new auction page used to sell their
victims’ stolen data, implying that victims’ partners will be interested in buying it. To
participate in such an auction, a minimum deposit of 10% from the start price is required.
Also, auctioned data can be bought immediately at a “Blitz price” ranging from $50,000 to
$42 million.
At the moment of writing the article, 15 auctions are active on Sodinokibi’s blog and not one
of them received a top bid, leading to publishing the data of the lot. 22 auctions in total were
held to date, though once again there are no top bets available.

Since the Sodinokibi gang still publishes the data if the auction was unsuccessful, it seems
that they do not consider these auctions as an effective way of increasing their income.
Possibly, they see it as another means of pressuring their victims and prompting them to pay
the ransom. Thus, we do not expect other ransomware gangs to hold such auctions;
however, it can be regarded as another trick in the growing list of new ways to intimidate the
victims.

Sodinokibi website where it is stated that non-sold data was published for free

As one of these methods, we can also consider how the ransomware operators are
strengthening their ransom requests by claiming that they will send the link to the
blog to all customers, partners, investors, and other interested parties. Such a threat
has been recently made by the same Sodinokibi gang in a post about a new victim where
they also addressed competitors and employees, inviting them to buy out the stolen data and
sue the company.

Sodinokibi’s website

Maze also exhaustively stated their intentions in the aforementioned press release: they are
threatening to sell commercially valuable information on the darknet, notify media and stock
exchanges about a breach and use the leaked information to attack clients and partners of
victims.
New players are keeping up with raising the stakes in their threats: the developers of new
Darkside ransomware promised to store leaked data for six months and send notifications of
the leak to all partners and customers.

Therefore, based on observed auctions and announcements meant to intimidate victims, we
can conclude that cybercriminals went from private threats, made in the negotiations
with victims via chats, to public threats, which involve using both darknet and open
sources and can intimidate victims much more.
To sum up, all the analyzed ransomware gangs represent a new generation of cybercriminals
capable of evolving their tactics and diversifying their activities in order to gain more profit,
therefore posing a significant threat to all organizations. Thus, regular monitoring of
13/14

ransomware blogs can significantly benefit organizations and help them to reduce the risk of
being attacked.
