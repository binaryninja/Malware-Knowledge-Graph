Introduction
What do Paris Hilton, Jimmy Fallon, and Justin
Bieber all have in common? Collectively they all
spent millions on a popular non-fungible token
(NFT) called the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC).
Depending on how they store their NFTs, they
could also become high-profile targets for
cybercrime. Already, in December 2021, a BAYC
collector lost $2.2 million after his BAYC and
Mutant Ape Yacht Club NFTs were stolen by a
hacker.

analyzed the BABADEDA Crypter, a crypter that
specifically targets crypto and NFT communities
through malicious Discord bots. Not only have
the attackers behind this campaign evolved their
attack methods since then (using other crypters
besides the BABADEDA), but we have also
recently noticed an increasing number of stopped
attacks on Morphisec’s customers’ devices which
originated from this particular NFT campaign.

This was not an isolated incident. With the
NFT market booming (NFT trading volume
increased by over 20,000% from 2020 to 2021),
cybercriminals have rushed to adapt their
strategies to exploit this still relatively new trend.
From imitating social media accounts for NFT
creators to making fake Google ads, hackers are
exploring all avenues to make away with people’s
cryptos and NFTs.

In this report, we pick up where we left off in
November 2021, taking a closer look at the
attacker’s motivations, infrastructure, and
activities. We also explain why Next-Generation
Anti-Virus (NGAV) and Endpoint Detection and
Response (EDR) solutions are not able to protect
against these types of campaigns and how
Moving Target Defense technology can keep your
devices safe from this dangerous threat.

However, one emerging threat vector for crypto
crimes that the Morphisec Research Team
has noticed and that is particularly worrying is
happening through the Discord app. Last year, we

Wait… WHAT is an NFT???
Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are digital files
that, like cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or
Ethereum, exist on a blockchain, a form of digital
ledger. NFTs can be any type of digital object,
from artwork and memes to tweets and audio. In
some instances, NFTs may also be tied to physical
objects.
Each NFT has a digital signature that acts as proof
of ownership. However, unlike cryptocurrencies,
NFTs are non-fungible, meaning that they can’t

be equally exchanged for something else, nor
can they be reproduced. In this way, NFTs can be
likened to limited edition Baseball cards or rare
minted coins, where rarity/scarcity equals value.
Compounded by increased interest in
cryptocurrency (the underlying foundation to
creating and tracking NFTs), this has caused a
125% increase in NFT growth, and everyone is
jumping in to grab a piece of the pie.

An Expanding Metaverse
Part of what is propelling the growth
of NFT adoption is the promise of the
metaverse. The metaverse will be an
online, three-dimensional universe
that combines multiple virtual spaces.
Although it doesn’t yet exist, many
see it as a future version of the
internet. Accessing these 3D spaces
via smartglasses, mobile apps, gaming
consoles, and other metaverse-friendly
devices, users, represented as 3D
avatars, will be able to collaborate, shop,
play games, and socialize, much in the
same way they do already in the real
world.

As an immersive virtual economy, the metaverse will rely on cryptocurrencies as a mode of payment,
with each metaverse likely to have its own set of coins. Users will be able to use these coins to pay for
goods and services within the metaverse, including NFTs, virtual real estate, shoes, and more. Walmart,
Adidas, Gucci, and other popular brands have already invested millions as they make a giant leap into
the realm of virtual goods.

More Money, More
Problems

One unforeseen consequence of the
growing interest in cryptocurrencies,
NFTs, and the metaverse is the rising
number of scams. Considering that the
NFT market is worth $7 billion and that
stealing NFTs can net malicious actors
millions of dollars overnight, this is not
surprising.

As users and businesses continue to
embrace this new form of e-commerce,
criminals are finding new ways to
exploit them. We cover this trend in
detail in the next section.

Early Warnings - Findings from the
Morphisec Research Team
Not long ago, the Morphisec Research Team
investigated an NFT and crypto crime campaign
known as the BABADEDA Crypter, which we
discovered during a new crypter research study.
During our investigation, we focused on the
crypter’s mechanism and capabilities while also
briefly discussing a new campaign targeting the
crypto and NFT communities.

The recent surge in NFT scams and crypto crime
activities, as well as a rising number of attacks
on our customers’ devices (fully prevented by
Morphisec) linked to this NFT campaign, has
prompted us to dive deeper into the attacker’s
infrastructure and dissect its activity.
In this report, we will walk you through the
progression of the attacker’s infrastructure
and capabilities since November 2020, the first
evidence of its activity, until today.

Infection Strategy

Before moving forward, we need to understand the attacker’s workflow, starting with who their target
victims are, up until the point they steal their funds.
In this campaign, we identified that the attacker’s targets are Crypto and NFT communities (as per our
previous investigation). We know that the actor impersonates existing Crypto/NFT services with a Discord
channel. Thus, their victims are members of such communities.
Here is an example of a real scam conducted on a popular Discord forum on February 7, 2022.

Here is another example.

Can You Spot a Fake?
Take the example below. Two of the
three NFTs are fakes. Can you tell
which ones?
The leftmost NFT is sold by an artist
with a stolen profile picture. We
know this NFT is a scam because
it doesn’t have a yellow verification
check mark in the upper left-hand
corner.
Source: Benzinga
The NFT in the middle is also a fake.
However, it is obvious that it was
created by a more sophisticated criminal because they were able to fake the verification check mark.
Nevertheless, if you zoom in, you can tell the difference between this verification check mark and a real
check mark (the NFT on the right, with the verification check mark extending outside the avatar).

The sophistication of these types of scams, along with the attacks that follow, is increasing every day.

You’ve Been Scammed, Now What?
By looking at the full attack chain, we can infer that the actor wants to steal high-value NFTs and
cryptocurrencies. Their motives explain why they chose the kind of malware delivery method they did.

Full attack chain [Source: Morphisec]

The attack chain comprises several components, and each one can be used as a standalone or as a
service. This means that the actor stealing funds from a particular victim is not necessarily the developer
of these components. The fact that the components are independent gives the attacker the ability to
improve or change tactics quickly.
We will cover the following components in the following sections:
•

•

•

•

The attacker creates Discord bots that, to
the uninitiated eye, may look like they are
owned by one of the official community
administrators.
The bots send private messages to channel
members inviting them to download the new
desktop application from an official-looking
website that is actually owned by the attacker.
The website is a perfect copy of the real site
with one major change - a download button
to the fake desktop application.
Even when the application is downloaded and
executed, victims still have no idea something

•

•

is wrong. Under the hood, however, the
malware unpacks itself and loads the final
payload.
The final payload, usually RAT, is used
to steal the victim’s browsing data and
install keylogger and other surveillance
functionalities, including ones that give the
attacker complete control over the victim’s
machine.
The attacker can use the stolen data to take
over the victim’s identity and transfer their
possessions to their own wallet/account.

Malicious bots facilitate over 90% of NFT scams. These bots can be easily obtained through Discord
forums, Twitter, and underground exchange communities on the dark web. They are easy to operate
and are very lucrative. A motivated bot operator can purchase a program for 0.2 Ethereum ($600 at the
time of this writing) and get a 15x+ return in only one week. This return compounds as experience and
efficiencies are gained.

Evolution of the Threat Actor

Campaign Timeline

Although an attack chain has many components, when looking at the evolution of the campaign, two
main components jumped out:
1. Improved architecture (both decoy servers and file servers)
2. The final payload used once successful infection is achieved.
In this section, we’ll explain each component and its progression over time:
• Infrastructure - the DevOps and networking infrastructures required from start to finish.
• Execution Methods - which Crypter is being used to deliver the final payload.
• Final Payloads - what final payload the actor used.

Infrastructure
Discord Bots

The actor uses Discord bots to reach their victims. They do so by sending official-looking DMs in targeted
Discord channels:

Discord private message luring a user to download a malicious app

To do this, the actor creates dozens of Discord bots that automatically send these messages to potential
victims. However, spamming a forum with bots raises suspicions immediately.

Bots accounts discovered by a user

Previously, finding and blocking the spamming bots was relatively easy - as shown on the previous page leading the actor to use better naming conventions.

Different names to the bots

The latest campaign shows the actor using different content within these messages and randomized yet
still valid looking usernames. This suggests that the actor actively improves their phishing capabilities and
develops their infection method over time.

Decoy Sites

The main purpose of these fraudulent Discord messages is to lure the victim into downloading the “new
official desktop application” from the “official site.” Keeping its real intentions hidden, the attacker creates
an identical copy of the home page. The only thing they change is the CTA button.

Decoy vs. Original Site

Although the technique for creating decoy sites hasn’t changed, the targeted apps did. The attacker
changes the active decoys according to the community it’s currently targeting.

It is not clear why the attacker changes the targeted applications and communities. However, we
can assume they do so when their scam is revealed or when they are trying to find a better attacking
landscape in new and unaware communities.

File Servers

The third step of the
infection is responsible for
delivering the executable
to the victim. During our
research period, we tracked
architectural changes in
this mechanism. It looks like
the attacker tested several
approaches, and now they
converge these into their
final version.

Fake application delivery methods

www.morphisec.com | 12
© 2022 Morphisec Inc.

Version 1: The attacker hosted the fake application inside its respective decoy site. For example,
terra-money[.]net served the file Terra_Station_Setup_1.2.1.exe when making a request to
terra-money[.]net/station/Terra_Station_Setup_1.2.1.exe route.
Version 2: Cybersquatting. Decoy site A redirects the traffic to decoy site B that holds its malware.
For example, safemoone[.]net is a decoy site to the original safemoon.net redirected by
larvaslab[.]com to download the fake application from safemoone[.]us/download/
LarvaLabs-App_v2.1.1-setup.exe route.
Version 3: All decoys download from the same centralized file server. As of writing this report, the file
servers used in this campaign are:

There’s a clear shift between the methods used. In the beginning, the actor used the simplest working
solution. We assume that the second method is a transition step to the third method - we saw a large
number of decoy sites downloading from only two other decoy sites. Observing the third method, we
can see that the attacker has evolved to use the “right” way from a distributed application’s architecture

point of view.
Although the third method allows greater flexibility for the attacker to update their malware due to a
centralized repository, the problem with this method is that it opens one point of failure - once the
currently active file server is down, the attack chain breaks.

Hosting Services

The actor uses EuroByte’s services as its preferred hosting service to deliver their fake applications. We
have found references of other cybercriminals using EuroByte’s services to host DCRat botnet controller
(asos[.]click), Emotet (azatop[.]ru, korechok[.]ru, …), AutoKMS (kmsmatrix[.]info), etc.

Execution Methods

After mapping the infrastructure used throughout the campaign, we dug into the actor’s execution
methods. This campaign was first revealed when our team researched a new crypter used in the wild,
but that’s not the only crypter used.
At the beginning of the campaign (see the table below), we saw evidence of the actor using custom .NET
Crypters and Crypto Obfuscator. However, starting from August 2021, it looks like the actor has moved
to use BABADEDA Crypter as their main crypter of choice.
Although we don’t think this threat actor is the developer behind BABADEDA Crypter, we found that they
are the first to use the latest variants. This may suggest that this threat actor purchased a private stub or
that there is a close relationship between the two.
By now, we know who the victims are, and we are also aware of the attacker’s goal. What’s left is
understanding how the goal was achieved. To answer this question, we traced the final payload from the
beginning of the campaign to the end. This resulted in three different RATs used as the final payload Remcos, BitRAT, and AsyncRAT.
This can be seen in the following table:

Technical Details
One of the more recent features added to the attack chain is the usage of a DLL sideloading attack to
inject the final payload into a benign application. In our previous research, we explained in detail the
inner workings of the BABADEDA Crypter. During our current investigation, we observed that all fake
applications utilize a DLL Side-Loading technique on trusted applications such as iisexpress.exe (IIS
Express), A3DUtility.exe (Adobe Acrobat Reader), and TopoEdit.exe (Microsoft tool)

DLL Side-Loading

The additional layer allows attackers to run the BABADEDA Crypter under a legitimate process instead of
a fake one, as done previously. As shown in the figure above, a new DLL is loaded into the process.
First, the fake application’s installer will unpack the files to the destination directory. Then it launches
the benign executable, for example, A3DUtility.exe. Inside the executable’s import table, we will
find BIB.dll import. This is a modified version of the original BIB.dll, used for sideloading the first
stage of the malicious payload. This version of BIB.dll isn’t signed and has another entry in its IAT - an
import of AcroInfo.dll.

Although the name may trick you into thinking this file is part of a benign Adobe Reader installation, in
reality, this DLL loads the BABADEDA Crypter we covered in our previous research.

BABADEDA Crypter already had a low detection rate in VT, and the new variant helps keep it totally FUD

Options to Prevention and Response
Gaining Insights

Hacked credentials and crypto accounts are among the most sought-after and valuable items for
purchase on the dark web and underground communities. Due to the skyrocketing prices of BTC, ETH,
and other cryptocurrencies, hacked accounts may hold large sums of coin-based currency and cash,
protected by relaxed security measures after the initial verification process. This can then be cashed in
for NFTs and other high-value goods in the metaverse and the physical world.

Morphisec Insights, as well as Morphisec Threat Intelligence, can act as an early warning system for
your enterprise to give you visibility into criminals that are targeting your employees and organization.
Credential theft and account takeover is a common entry point for criminals to establish a foothold into
your organization and move laterally, further enforcing more damage to business operations and critical
assets. The industry best practice is to monitor the areas where criminals operate to mitigate attacks
before they occur.

Moving Target Defense

As a prevention-focused solution, Morphisec Guard morphs device memory to confuse and trap
attacks that avoid NGAV solutions. As a result, defenders can automatically protect assets like NFTs and
cryptocurrencies against zero-day threats like the crypters discussed in this report.

When All Else Fails

In many cases, we have found that it is already too late to prevent this type of attack from occurring,
and incident response (IR) is needed. Morphisec Incident Response team works collaboratively with
client organizations to triage critical security incidents and conduct forensic analysis to solve immediate
cyberattacks, as well as provide recommendations for reducing your organization’s risk exposure.
The Morphisec IR team will leverage this insight to:
• Help contain in-progress incidents and reduce damage.
• Provide recommendations for long-term risk reduction.
• Audit critical infrastructure to ensure you have the lowest possible risk of exposure to a
cyberattack.

Conclusion
As demonstrated above, these highly dangerous
crypters can have a devastating effect. Targeting
cryptocurrency users through trusted attack
vectors gives its distributors a fast-growing
selection of potential victims. Because crypters
can masquerade as known applications with
complex obfuscation techniques, anyone
relying on traditional signature-based malware
detection has no way of knowing if a crypter is on
their machine and can’t stop it from executing.
Machine learning and behavior-based endpoint
protection platforms (EPP) or endpoint detection

and response (EDR) solutions may also have a
difficult time detecting this type of attack, as they
are not as effective against in-memory attacks.
Mitigating the threat posed by a crypter
requires securing the device memory it targets.
Morphisec does this through Moving Target
Defense (MTD), a technology that creates a
dynamic attack surface and morphs process
memory to trap crypters like BABADEDA before
they are able to deploy.
