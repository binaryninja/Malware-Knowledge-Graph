If there’s one thing that businesses, boards of directors and C-level execs can take from CrowdStrike’s 2015 Threat
Report, it is that the paradigm has broadened beyond people, processes, and technology to now include integrated,
crowdsourced, and enriched threat intelligence.
Our Global Threat Report highlights that today’s threats, more than ever before, are driven by geopolitical and economic events around the world. The primary motivation behind global cyber activity has now shifted from disparate
activities carried out by individuals, groups and criminal gangs pursuing short-term financial gain, to skilled adversaries
driven by strategic global conflicts. The economic downturn and new Five Year Plan in China will continue to drive
their state-sponsored cyber espionage activities. The situation in the Ukraine and falling oil prices will continue to fuel
targeted intrusions from Russia. The conflict in the Middle East between Saudi Arabia and Iran over Yemen will continue
to generate hacktivism from that region. CEOs and boards of directors who ignore or disregard the ramifications of
global events such as these will pay for it in the loss of revenue, jobs, intellectual property, and shareholder value.
This shift underscores the importance for an effective intelligence program about the motivations of
your adversary. The mantra “people, processes and technology” is no longer enough for cyber security. In today’s threat environment, it takes people, processes, technology AND intelligence.
Intelligence is no longer a “nice-to-have.” It is a mandatory element of stopping breaches.
How can you expect to win if you do not have a solid understanding of how your adversary
operates, what their tendencies are, what their goals are, and what motivates them? Recognize
why they would want to come after you and your company. If you don’t know the game plan
of your adversary, you will fail to defend your corporation. It sounds like common sense, but
it is something that is lost in the outdated discussion of people, processes and technology.
Companies must have intelligence, either home-grown or provided by third-party sources who
have the trained personnel to monitor, capture and analyze threat data effectively.
Emphasizing intelligence has been a cornerstone for CrowdStrike’s approach to security since the foundation of the company five years ago: Providing cloud-based security powered by comprehensive, in-house
threat intelligence. With our Falcon Platform and Threat Intelligence team, we have a unique bird’s-eye view by having
our endpoint sensors deployed in more than 170 different countries, handling more than ten billion events per day,
as well as providing incident response services in response to some of the largest breaches. The “brains” behind our
Falcon Platform is our Threat Graph engine, which constantly collects and analyzes billions of events, both in real time
and retrospectively. As a result, on a weekly basis, we are identifying and mitigating hundreds of breaches for which
traditional defenses silently fail.
The CrowdStrike team has put tremendous effort into capturing this real attack telemetry, analyzing it, distilling how
adversaries operate, and more importantly, what motivates them. We hope our experiences and the lessons learned that
are manifested in the 2015 Threat Report will provide companies a sampling of the intelligence they need to protect
themselves in 2016 and beyond.

INTRODUCTION
At CrowdStrike, a fundamental belief is that intelligence powers everything we do.
It drives our next-generation endpoint protection, it fuels our incident response
teams so they can resolve incidents faster, and it is consumed by our customers
and their enterprise tools, allowing them to detect and stop attacks.

TARGETED INTRUSIONS

CHINA

In 2015 high-profile targeted intrusion
activity was observed that revealed
behavior not often associated
with China-based adversaries, and
which also provided some insight
into how these actors operate.

In recent years, adversaries aligned with the interests of the People’s
Republic of China (PRC) have dominated vendor threat reporting, security
research blogs, and mainstream news by targeting international businesses,
governments, dissident groups, and not-for-profit organizations. During
2015, however, the media coverage was inundated by a series of breaches
of personally identifiable information (PII) stretching back through 2014.
The breaches were announced in rapid succession by a number of U.S.
healthcare providers and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

adversary groups may occur as a more efficient, centralized cyber military force takes shape. The complete
reorganization has an end goal of 2020, however the

CrowdStrike appears to align very closely with the likely

This group has been operating for at least 10 years; their
earliest malware used email-based C2 channels. Over the
following several years, the adversary moved to HTTPbased implants and more recent variants with added
technical complexities. Notably, during the timeframe of
the 2008 conflict between Russian and Georgia, a variant
was also repurposed to conduct DoS attacks against
Georgian government websites. The operators continue to
exhibit a high level of technical skill and regard for OPSEC,

2015 proved to be a tumultuous year
on the Korean Peninsula, a year that
started off under the cloud of the
Sony Pictures Entertainment breach.

In January, President Obama issued Executive Order 13687, which imposed further
economic sanctions on the “hermit kingdom”. Numerous high-ranking officials were
executed in 2015 as the young leader Kim Jong Un sought to solidify his control of
the regime. Weapons tests, such as a spring announcement about the test of a Submarine Launched Ballistic Missile (SLBM), and continued development of the missile and space programs, further illustrated the intentions of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) to continue agitating the international community.

riminal activity in the cyber domain,
eCrime, is a complex topic. There are
many different components to eCrime;
this includes the distribution of malware,

complex phishing schemes, malware operations,
monetizing funds from compromised systems or
accounts, the laundering of funds, and reshipping
schemes for ill-gotten gains. The reality is that
eCrime is an ecosystem, where different organizations and individuals weave intricate relationships
in order to exploit their victims, and they are
constantly evolving and improving their tradecraft.
To understand the eCrime threat landscape, one
must use a wide aperture to fully appreciate the
variety and magnitude of the problem. In 2015,
CrowdStrike observed some interesting trends
in the criminal activity affecting our customers,
ranging from technical innovations through
novel attack techniques. Notably, 2015 saw
the re-emergence of extortion schemes using
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks; this
behavior has been replicated by several actors.
Additionally, there was a massive uptick in intelligent phishing schemes where the attackers leveraged remote access toolkits to learn the lexicon
of their targets, and they used the intelligence
they collected to devise compelling schemes in
order to manipulate targets in the finance organizations of companies. Criminal activity continues
to thrive in the shadow of legal impediments to
law enforcement, and the ability of the actors to
hide in the relative anonymity of the Internet.

Russia’s neighbouring countries. In short, some crimeware
tools have turned into targeted attack malware and no
longer allow a precise classification in either category.
In 2015, the Stegoloader malware was an example of a stealthy
and sophisticated tool that fits this category. Through the
use of steganography, it is able to hide malicious code in
innocuous images. At the same time, benign image-hosting
websites serve as peers in order to distribute the malicious code—a successful way to evade reputation-based
protection means and a challenge for takedown attempts.
Verbose profiling of an infected computer allows the operator to selectively deploy modules required for a specific
purpose, such as monetization, or intelligence gathering.
Possibly as a consequence of the confluence of cybercriminal and espionage activities, tomorrow’s malware may
likely develop into a multi-purpose tool that provides a
platform suitable for a wide variety of malicious operations.
Such an open-ended architecture and the complexities
involved in determining the actor’s intent is likely to pose
a research challenge to defenders in the near future.
