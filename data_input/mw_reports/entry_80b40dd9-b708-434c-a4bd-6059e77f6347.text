On March 15, 2017, our Phishing Defense Center observed several emails with the subject
line “Request for quotation” pretending to award Shell Oil Company contracts – a very
targeted subject tailored to the receiver. As with most phishing emails, there is a compelling
call to action for the receiver, in this case a contract award from a well-known organization.
And, an added bonus unknown to the receiver, the emails also contained a malicious
attachment designed to siphon data from its targets.
Included is an example of one of these emails along with basic Triage header information.
Each email analyzed contained instructions to open an attached .ace archive file that when
decompressed revealed a Windows executable containing Loki Bot Malware.
Loki Bot is a commodity malware sold on underground sites which is designed to steal
private data from infected machines, and then submit that info to a command and control
host via HTTP POST. This private data includes stored passwords, login credential
information from Web browsers, and a variety of cryptocurrency wallets.
The following Loki Bot executable was identified during our analysis.

As always, PhishMe cautions our customers to be wary of emails requesting information or
promising reward. Specific to this sample, we recommend that customers be observant for
emails containing the subject line “Request for quotation” or emails promising business with
new or unknown businesses. PhishMe Simulator customers who feel this type of offer might
be successful with its employees should consider launching simulations that follow this style
of attack to further train their users.
Additionally, incident responders should consider blocking the domain and IP address
mentioned above, as well as searching endpoint systems for the MD5’s if internal systems
support it.
