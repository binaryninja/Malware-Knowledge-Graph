“RAWPOS” MALWARE TARGETING LODGING MERCHANTS
Distribution: Merchants, Acquirers
Summary
The “rawpos” malware is a memory scraper infecting global lodging merchants at an alarming rate.
Variants date as far back as 2008, and it is one of the first known memory scrapers to target Point of
Sale (POS) systems. Typically clustered in three files, there is no standard infection method for this
malware. Of particular note with recent samples is a logic bomb that does not function outside the
timing parameters. Adherence to PCI-DSS 3.0 should mitigate this malware.
Distribution and Installation
Once a vulnerable POS system is identified, various components of the malware are used to discover
track data by only targeting the “memdump” portion of a Windows system. A memory dump can be
the contents of memory on a system and where cardholder data temporarily resides during a payment
transaction. This particular malware piece can be compiled with Perl2Exe. Perl2Exe is a program that
takes codes scripted in the Perl language and bundles it into a Windows executable, which hides the
Perl code. Numerous directories and file extensions are ignored. Any files not containing the ignored
directories and file extensions are searched for track data using a regular expression similar to the
format listed below:
((B(([0-9]{13,16})|([0-9]|\\s){13,25})\\^[A-Z\\s0-9]{0,30}\\/[A-Z\\s0-9]{0,30}\\^(0[7-9]|1[09])((0[1-9])|(1[0-2]))([0-9]|\\s){3,50}[0- 9]{1})|([0-9]{15,16}([A-Z]|=)(0[7-9]|1[0-9])((0[1-9])|(1[02]))[0-9]{8,30})|(<Field name=\"CardNumber\">[0-9]{15,19}</Field>)|(~CCM[0-9]{15,19}D[09]{4}~))
Discovered track data is encrypted with an XOR key, such as 'anonymousgroup'. This data is delimited
with the '$$$' character combination. Encrypted data can be written to a separate file, sometimes
named “dxdiag32.dll”. Data is also dumped in clear-text to .dmp files on the victim system in the
“memdump” directory. For example:
memdump\\<process_name>_<pid>.dmp
A second file is also installed as a service by providing the '-install' or '/install' parameter. This creates a
persistence mechanism which allows the scraper to continually run so long as the service is running.
The sample is installed with the following attributes:
Service Name: xxx XXXManager
Display Name: xxx XXXManager
Visa Public
1

Description: [N/A]
Executable Path:
C:\PROGRA~1\xxx\SECURE~1\v1.2.0.3\XXXPrimaryManager\Bin\XXXManagerService.exe
Startup Type: Automatic
Alternatively, the malware removes this service if the '-remove' or '/remove' argument is supplied. In
the event the '-debug' or '/debug' argument is provided, the malware will run in standalone mode. By
default, the malware will attempt to start the service. When executed, the sample is responsible for
executing the following commands on the victim host:
pushd
C:\\PROGRA~1\\xxx\\Secure~1\\v1.2.0.3\\XXXPrimaryManager\\Bin&start /min
xxxprimarymanager.exe&start /min xxxsecondarymanager.exe
The executable can also install itself in the System32 folder.
Additional files and hashes often coupled with “rawpos” include:
mmc.exe
vsssvc.exe
visaudp.exe
psex.exe (aka “psexec”)
sdelete.exe
se.exe
framepkg.exe
spoolsv.chm
While there is no common method of exfiltration associated with this malware family, infected
merchants observed payment card data sitting on non-POS systems, suggesting attackers stage the
stolen data elsewhere on the network prior to exfiltration.
Best Practices
Visa requires participants in the payment ecosystem to comply with all PCI-DSS requirements and
recommends participants implement the following best practices:


Control the Windows Administrator account. Make it more difficult for malware to gain
Administrative privileges.
 Assign a strong password for all accounts on the POS system.
 Create a unique local Administrator password for each and every POS system.
 Do not allow users to be local Administrators on a POS system.
 Change passwords frequently, across the enterprise (at least every 90 days).

Ensure the POS system functions as a single purpose machine. To reduce the risk of malicious
software infections, disallow all applications and services (i.e. Internet browsers, email clients)
that are not directly required as part of the POS’s core functionality in processing payments.
Keep operating system patch levels up to date. For Windows, this means ensuring Windows
Update is functioning and automatically applying monthly security patches. For non-supported
operating systems like Windows XP, there should be a plan to migrate to a current operating
system.
Restrict permissions on Windows file sharing or disable file sharing altogether. Unless
absolutely necessary, Visa recommends disabling file sharing on POS systems. Microsoft has
published instructions on how to disable simple file sharing and set permissions on shared
folders.
Restrict remote access services use. Unless necessary, disable remote access services, ports
and accounts. If remote access services are needed, enable only when needed.
Promote security awareness. Design anti-phishing programs, defense in depth strategies, and
promote shared responsibility in security awareness.

Microsoft’s support for Windows XP ended in April 2014and will end in January 2016 for Windows XP
Embedded (XPe). Risk for POS applications built on these platforms will increase. See Microsoft
Windows XP Support lifecycle timeline for more details.
