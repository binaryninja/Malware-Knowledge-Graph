China’s Five-Year Plan: A Pursuit for GDP Growth &
Technological Self-Sufficiency

March 17, 2021

China’s 14th Five-Year Plan draft, which sets goals and strategies for developing the
country’s economy until 2025, was unveiled last week.
China’s Five-Year Plans set economic and social development targets, and this year’s FiveYear Plan highlights China’s continued interest in technological selfreliance; ongoing geopolitical tensions with the US, Hong Kong, and Taiwan; and the need to
address security, cybersecurity and climate change.
QuoIntelligence analyzed the plan carefully. Check out our infographic for the
key-takeaways or read the in-depth analysis focusing closely on self-reliance in
technology, GDP / domestic growth, national security, etc. and its impact on
cybersecurity and geopolitics.

At Least Six Percent Economic Growth planned for Semiconductors
and Other High-Tech Industries
For the first time, the Five-Year Plan did not set out GDP targets for the whole Five-Year
period but allowed for annual target adjustments, setting a goal of at least 6 percent growth
for 2021. Continuing on from the previous Five-Year Plan as well as the Made in China

2025 policy, technological self-reliance is central to the Plan as a tool for development and
growth.
To achieve the GDP growth target, the government will provide strategic support to develop
key sectors and increase R&D spending by more than 7 percent annually. The key sectors
identified are high-end semiconductors, computer processors, cloud computing, artificial
intelligence (AI), quantum information, brain science, genetic research and biotechnology,
and clinical medicine and health.

China’s Pursuit for Economic Independence from the US
In light of current geopolitical tensions, China aims to lessen its dependence on foreign
suppliers. For example, in the face of US tariffs and trade restrictions, China seeks to
promote domestic consumption by boosting Chinese-supplied components and technology
and relying less on foreign inputs. Additionally, the Five-Year policy aims to bolster China’s
national security system with an announced 6.8 percent rise in military spending.

Key-Takeaways Through a Cybersecurity and Geopolitics Lense
From the perspective of cyber intelligence, international security, and geopolitics, the keytakeaways and potential implications from the 14th Five-Year Plan are:

Achieving technological self-sufficiency
Chinese leaders identified tech development as a matter of national security for the first time
in a Five-Year Plan. This comes as a result of increasing pressure on trade, such
as through US sanctions and tariffs, which impact China’s ability to rely on a stable supply of
the technologies that help drive its economic growth.

The increased importance of tech development could lead to an increase in cyber industrial
espionage as in the past, QuoIntelligence observed Chinese-linked Advanced Persistent
Threat (APT) groups, like the Winnti Group, targeting companies in sectors of high interest to
the Chinese government. Furthermore, China’s emphasis on developing alternative supply
chains to counteract US sanctions will likely further exacerbate the ongoing tech race.
However, while governments around the world, including the US and EU, have expressed
their interest in shortening supply chains and bolstering domestic production, the highly
complex and globalized state of supply chains makes success unlikely over the short to
medium term. Therefore, based on previous observations, China’s attempt to bolster
domestic manufacturing could result in more industrial espionage campaigns and further
deteriorate relations between the US and China.

Growth strategy centered on boosting domestic demand:
China is trying to counter US tariffs by boosting domestic demand while also promoting
the integration of the Chinese economy with the rest of the world. However, prioritizing the
consumption of Chinese-made products across China could increase costs for Chinese
companies relying on imported goods and technology and hinder growth objectives.

National security focus and increased defense expenditure
For the first time, the plan contains a special section for security development, aiming to
bolster national security capabilities. The plan contemplates a 6.8 percent rise in military
spending amid territorial disputes with India, as well as tensions with Taiwan and in the South
China Sea, as well as ambitions to match the US and Russia in weapons technology.
The focus on national security and defense is likely to be accompanied by increasing cyber
capabilities and campaigns to support China’s development and strategic ambitions. For
example, the recent espionage campaign involving the Chinese-linked HAFNIUM
group exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange servers to target research, defense,
and policy-making groups across the US highlights this threat. A potential increase in
government and military espionage points towards China’s growing focus on military and
geopolitical ambitions.

Actively deploy global partnerships with the EU
Amid tensions with the US government, China appears to be prioritizing partnerships
with nations regarded as close US allies. For example, China intends to finalize an
investment treaty with the EU based on an agreement reached last December and China
also aims to implement the China-Japan-South Korea free trade agreement.

Reduce CO2 emissions intensity

China aims to reduce the amount of CO2 produced by 18 percent over the period 2021 to
2025. The prioritization of new and green technology might also result in increased industrial
espionage, which would allow Chinese companies to accelerate the development of green
products.

Tighten control over Hong Kong
While the central government said it will ensure the implementation of the doctrine that
guarantees Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy, officials have announced changes to
Hong Kong electoral system that will reduce the public’s role in government. This could
complicate China’s relations with Western countries and potentially hinder trade agreements
with the EU.

Espionage Campaigns Targeting the HighTech Sector Expected To Rise
The Five-Year Plan provides an insight into China’s priorities in the coming years and can
help countries and organizations forecast future challenges. The 2021-2025 Five-Year
Plan positions technology innovation as a matter of national security. As a result,
QuoIntelligence expects continued sophisticated espionage campaigns targeting the hightech sector, particularly the semiconductor sector.
In addition, emerging tech sectors such as quantum computing and self-driving and
hydrogen cars could become increasingly targeted. China’s growing focus on its military
development and defense expenditure indicates a shift from China’s previous focus on using
trade and economics to further China’s interests globally, to also include military power.
China’s more aggressive tone, already seen with democratic restrictions in Hong Kong and
continued pressure on Taiwan, could hinder China’s relations with Western countries, such
as the potential EU trade agreement.
