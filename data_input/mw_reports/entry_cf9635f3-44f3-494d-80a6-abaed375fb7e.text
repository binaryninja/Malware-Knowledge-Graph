Got this file attachment this week pretending to be from HSBC Global Payments and Cash Management. The
attachment payment_copy.pdf.z is a rar archive, kind of unusual with this type of file archive but when extracted,
it comes out as a double extension with pdf.exe. The file is a trojan infostealer and detected by multiple scanning
engines.

Using CyberChef Forensics -> Extract Files, you can view a list of files part of the executable from the .exe, .zlib
and various mp3 and png.

1/3

Saving some of the files to review and analyze them:
