Linguistic Analysis of WannaCry Ransomware Messages Suggests
Chinese-Speaking Authors
Since the May 12, 2017, “WannaCry” ransomware worm attack, researchers have struggled
with the question of attribution. As of this writing, a number of researchers have linked the
activity to the suspected North Korean-affiliated “Lazarus Group” due to similarities in the
code and the infrastructure. Flashpoint analysts conducted similar analyses, but also
included a linguistic and cultural review of the 28 ransom notes found within the WannaCry
malware to determine the native tongue of the author(s).

Analysis
Flashpoint analyzed each of the notes individually for content, accuracy, and style, and then
compared results. Analysts also compared the ransom notes to previous ransom messages
associated with other ransomware samples to determine if there was reuse. Unsurprisingly,
there are many similarities, but an exact match was not found. The WannaCry samples
analyzed by Flashpoint contained language configuration files with translated ransom
messages for the following languages:
1. Bulgarian
2. Chinese (Simplified)
3. Chinese (Traditional)
4. Croatian
5. Czech
6. Danish
7. Dutch
8. English
9. Filipino
10. Finnish
11. French
12. German
13. Greek
14. Indonesian
15. Italian
16. Japanese
17. Korean
18. Latvian
19. Norwegian
20. Polish
21. Portuguese
22. Romanian
23. Russian
24. Slovak
25. Spanish
26. Swedish
27. Turkish
28. Vietnamese

Analysis revealed that nearly all of the ransom notes were translated using Google Translate
and that only three, the English version and the Chinese versions (Simplified and
Traditional), are likely to have been written by a human instead of machine translated.

Though the English note appears to be written by someone with a strong command of
English, a glaring grammatical error in the note suggest the speaker is non-native or perhaps
poorly educated.
Flashpoint found that the English note was used as the source text for machine translation
into the other languages. Comparisons between the Google translated versions of the
English ransomware note to the corresponding WannaCry ransom note yielded nearly
identical results, producing a 96% or above match.

Chinese Ransomware Notes
The two Chinese ransom notes differ substantially from other notes in content, format, and
tone. Google Translate fails in both Chinese-English and English-Chinese tests, producing
inaccurate results that suggests the Chinese text was likely not have been similarly
generated by the English text.
A number of unique characteristics in the note indicate it was written by a fluent Chinese
speaker. A typo in the note, “帮组” (bang zu) instead of “帮助” (bang zhu) meaning “help,”
strongly indicates the note was written using a Chinese-language input system rather than
being translated from a different version. More generally, the note makes use of proper
grammar, punctuation, syntax, and character choice, indicating the writer was likely native or
at least fluent. There is, however, at least one minor grammatical error which may be
explained by autocomplete, or a copy-editing error.
The text uses certain terms that further narrow down a geographic location. One term, “礼拜”
for “week,” is more common in South China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore; although it
is occasionally used in other regions of the country. The other “杀毒软件” for “anti-virus” is
more common in the Chinese mainland.
Perhaps most compelling, the Chinese note contains substantial content not present in any
other version of the note, is lengthier, and differs slightly in format.

Conclusions

3/4

Flashpoint assesses with high confidence that the author(s) of WannaCry’s ransomware
notes are fluent in Chinese, as the language used is consistent with that of Southern China,
Hong Kong, Taiwan, or Singapore. Flashpoint also assesses with high confidence that the
author(s) are familiar with the English language, though not native. This alone is not enough
to determine the nationality of the author(s).

Flashpoint assesses with moderate confidence that the Chinese ransom note served as the
original source for the English version, which then generated machine translated versions of
the other notes. The Chinese version contains content not in any of the others, though no
other notes contain content not in the Chinese. The relative familiarity found in the Chinese
text compared to the others suggests the authors were fluent in the language—perhaps
comfortable enough to use the language to write the initial note.
Given these facts, it is possible that Chinese is the author(s)’ native tongue, though other
languages cannot be ruled out. It is also possible that the malware author(s)’ intentionally
used a machine translation of their native tongue to mask their identity. It is worth noting that
characteristics marking the Chinese note as authentic are subtle. It is thus possible, though
unlikely, that they were intentionally included to mislead.
