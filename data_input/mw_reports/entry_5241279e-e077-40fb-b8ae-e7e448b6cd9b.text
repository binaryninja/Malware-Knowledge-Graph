Billing fraud is one of the most common sources of income for cybercriminals. There are
currently a number of known mobile Trojans specializing in secretly subscribing users to paid
services. They usually pay for legitimate services in a user’s name and scammers take a cut
from the money billed. These types of subscription fees tend to be fleeced from the phone
balance.
A user who is genuinely interested in subscribing to a service normally needs to visit the
content provider’s website and click “subscribe.” As Trojan apps are capable of simulating a
click on this icon, service providers sometimes require a confirmation code sent in a text
message to complete subscription. In other cases, marketplaces try to make it harder to
automate subscription by using a CAPTCHA, while others analyze traffic and block
subscription scams using anti-fraud solutions. Yet there are some types of malware which
can bypass at least some of these protections.

Jocker: Text message thief in Google Play
1/21

Trojans from the Trojan.AndroidOS.Jocker family can intercept codes sent in text messages
and bypass anti-fraud solutions. They’re usually spread on Google Play, where scammers
download legitimate apps from the store, add malicious code to them and re-upload them to
the store under a different name. The trojanized apps fulfill their original purposes in most
cases, and the user won’t suspect they are a source of threats.
To bypass vetting on Google Play, the Trojan monitors whether it’s gone live. The malicious
payload will remain dormant while the app is stalled at the vetting stage.

Checking availability on Google Play
While trojanized apps are removed from the store on a daily basis, it’s constantly flooded by
new ones to take their place. The screenshots below show examples of apps for messaging,
monitoring blood pressure, and document scanning using your phone’s camera, all of which
were still available on Google Play at the end of February.

(77a6c1c2f782c699d1e73a940f36a527)

Jocker functions
Once the infected app is installed on your device, it requests access to text messages if its
legitimate functionality requires it — for example, if it poses itself as a messaging app.
Otherwise, it requests access to notifications. Pop-up notifications about messages received
also contain the text of these messages, so access to notifications allows the malware to
intercept the confirmation codes to complete subscription.
Once launched, the malware downloads and launches a new file which inherits permissions
from the infected app. The earliest versions of the Trojan downloaded the subscription app
straight away. But presently Jocker is a staged downloader.

Launch of the first stage
The scammers avoid detection by using different options for the initial payload download and
launch. The entire process can involve a staged download of four files to deliver the final
payload to the infected device, where only the last file is responsible for the main aim of
subscribing the user.

Launch of stage 2 payload (SDK)

Launch of the main payload (SDK) for subscription
The main payload basically follows a standard scheme: it receives a URL of the subscription
page from the C&C server and opens it in an invisible window. Once the page is loaded, the
Trojan injects it with scripts which request a subscription and confirm it using an intercepted
code from the text message.
5/21

Code of Jocker’s main payload
Main “SDK” also has code for bypassing anti-fraud systems. For example, the malware can
modify the X-Requested-With header in an HTTP request, which can be used to identify the
particular app requesting a subscription. Jocker can also block or substitute anti-fraud
scripts.

Geography of Jocker attacks
From January 2021 to March 2022, Jocker most frequently attacked users in Saudi Arabia
(21.20%). Poland came second (8.98%) with Germany in third place (6.01%).

(4.12%), Austria (3.96%), Russia (3.53%), and China (2.91%).

MobOk skirts CAPTCHA

6/21

Another subscription Trojan identified as Trojan.AndroidOS.MobOk was also first detected in
an infected app on Google Play. However, this malware is now mainly spread as the payload
of another Trojan called Triada, which is present in preinstalled apps (usually system apps)
on certain smartphone models. It’s also built into popular apps, such as the APKPure app
store and a widely used modification of WhatsApp Messenger.
Trojan.AndroidOS.MobOk works on a principle similar to the malware described in the
previous section. A subscription page is opened in an invisible window and a confirmation
code stolen from a text message is stealthily entered there. If the malware is downloaded by
Triada, it inherits Triada’s access to text messages, but if MobOk is spread by itself, it will
request access to notifications, similarly to Jocker.
MobOk differs from Jocker in its additional capability of bypassing CAPTCHA. The Trojan
deciphers the code shown on the image by sending it to a special service.

Geography of MobOk attacks
The country where users encountered MobOk Trojans most frequently from January 2021 to
March 2022 was Russia (31.01%). Second place is occupied by India (11.17%), closely
followed by Indonesia (11.02%).

Fourth and fifth place were taken by Ukraine (8.31%) and Algeria (5.28%). The other
countries in the TOP 10 where the Trojan was most active were Mexico (2.62%), Brazil
(1.98%), Germany (1.63%), Turkey (1.43%), and Malaysia (1.27%).

Vesub — beware of fake apps
A malware called Trojan.AndroidOS.Vesub is spread through unofficial sources and imitates
popular games and apps like GameBeyond, Tubemate, Minecraft, GTA5 and Vidmate.

Examples of fake apps
Most of the apps completely lack any legitimate functionality. They begin subscribing straight
after they’re launched, while the user sees a loading window. However, there are some
examples such as a fake GameBeyond app where the detected malware was accompanied
by a random set of working games.
The subscription process used by Vesub is similar to the previous examples: the malware
opens an invisible window, requests a subscription, and enters a code received in a text
message.

Geography of Vesub attacks
Two out of every five users who encountered Vesub were in Egypt (40.27%). The family was
also active in Thailand (25.88%) and Malaysia (15.85%).

GriftHorse.l: read the small text
All of the apps described above subscribe users to legitimate third-party services, even if the
user doesn’t need them. However, there are other forms of malware which subscribe users
to the app authors’ own “service.”
You can end up subscribing to one of these services by simply not reading the user
agreement carefully enough. For example, apps which have recently been spread intensively
on Google Play offer to tailor personal weight-loss plans for a token fee.

Once launched, the app asks you to fill out a questionnaire.

A page then opens to inform the user that a personal plan is being generated.

Then all you need to do is pay for the service and receive your weight-loss plan, which the
scammers promise to send to your email address.

If you scroll down to the bottom of the page, you’ll see that the “service” charges a
subscription fee with automatic billing. This means money will be deducted from the user’s
bank account on a regular basis, needing no repeat confirmation from the user.
13/21

14/21

The fact that the app subscribes users to automatic billing is confirmed in the reviews section
on Google Play. Moreover, many users complain they were unable to cancel the subscription
directly through the actual app, while others mention they never received a weight-loss plan
after paying the subscription fee.

15/21

Kaspersky solutions detect these apps as Trojan.AndroidOS.GriftHorse.l. Our researchers
also detected websites that deploy a similar subscription scheme (article in Russian). These
websites offered access to a wider pool of materials, such as training courses on office suites

or online marketplace trading.

Geography of GriftHorse.l attacks
We observed the activity of Trojan GriftHorse.l from 25 January 2022. Kaspersky solutions
detected most instances of the Trojan on devices owned by users in Russia (81.37%). The
country which came in second for the most users affected was Saudi Arabia (6.07%), with
Egypt (1.91%) in third place.

GriftHorse.ae: don’t give out your number!
The Trojan detected as Trojan.AndroidOS.GriftHorse.ae may belong to the same family as
GriftHorse.l, but it behaves in a completely different way. The malware poses as apps for
recovering deleted files, editing photos and videos, blinking the flash for incoming calls,
navigation, document scanning, translation, and so on. Yet all these apps can do in practice
is request a phone number under the pretense of a login, although clicking “login” will
actually subscribe the user. This is the simplest form of subscription — it bills the cell phone
account and all it needs to complete the process is the victim’s phone number. It remains
unclear what exactly does the GriftHorse.ae Trojan subscribe the user to.

Fake login screen in an app
Like its relative, GriftHorse.ae is also spread through Google Play. Scammers upload a great
number of similar apps to the marketplace in the hope that at least some of them will be
available to users for a certain amount of time.

Geography of GriftHorse.ae attacks
Our radars picked up the GriftHorse.ae Trojan for the first time on 10 March 2022. Among
the users who fell victim to attacks in less than a month, 43.57% were located in Russia,
22.95% in Saudi Arabia, and 6.14% in Oman.

Forth and fifth place were taken by users in Poland (4.39%) and Belarus (3.22%).

General statistics on Trojan subscribers
From January 2021 to March 2022, the most active of the subscription Trojans covered in
this article was MobOk. It was encountered by 74.09% of the Kaspersky mobile solution
users who were attacked by the malware mentioned in this piece. Joker Trojans were
blocked on 17.16% of user devices, while the least active Trojans were from the families
Vesub (3.57%) and GriftHorse (3.53% of users encountered GriftHorse.l and 2.09%
encountered GriftHorse.ae). It’s still worth noting that GriftHorse is a new family and it’s only
beginning to pick up momentum.

Conclusion

19/21

Subscription Trojans can bypass bot detection on websites for paid services, and sometimes
they subscribe users to scammers’ own non-existent services.
To avoid unwanted subscriptions, avoid installing apps from unofficial sources, which is the
most frequent source of malware. You shouldn’t let your guard down when installing apps
from Google Play either: read the reviews, read up on the developer, the terms of use and
payment. For messaging choose a well-known app with positive reviews.
Even if you trust an app, you should avoid granting it too many permissions. Only allow
access to notifications for apps that need it to perform their intended purposes — for
example, to transfer notifications to wearable devices. Apps for something like themed
wallpapers or photo editing don’t need access to your notifications.
