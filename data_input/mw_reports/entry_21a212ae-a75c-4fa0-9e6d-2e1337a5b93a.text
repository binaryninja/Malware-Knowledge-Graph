Today, court documents were unsealed detailing work Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit has
executed to disrupt cyberattacks from a threat group we call Phosphorus – also known as
APT 35, Charming Kitten, and Ajax Security Team – which is widely associated with Iranian
hackers. Our court case against Phosphorus, filed in the U.S. District Court for Washington
D.C., resulted in a court order enabling us last week to take control of 99 websites the group
uses to conduct its hacking operations so the sites can no longer be used to execute attacks.
Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) and the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC)
have been tracking Phosphorus since 2013. Its activity is usually designed to gain access to
the computer systems of businesses and government agencies and steal sensitive
information. Its targets also include activists and journalists – especially those involved in
advocacy and reporting on issues related to the Middle East.
Phosphorus typically attempts to compromise the personal accounts of individuals through a
technique known as spear-phishing, using social engineering to entice someone to click on a
link, sometimes sent through fake social media accounts that appear to belong to friendly

1/2

contacts. The link contains malicious software that enables Phosphorus to access computer
systems.
Phosphorus also uses a technique whereby it sends people an email that makes it seem as
if there’s a security risk to their accounts, prompting them to enter their credentials into a web
form that enables the group to capture their passwords and gain access to their systems.
Both attack methods employ the use of websites that incorporate the names of well-known
brands, like Microsoft, to appear authentic. Websites registered and used by Phosphorus
include, for example, outlook-verify.net, yahoo-verify.net, verification-live.com, and
myaccount-services.net.
While we’ve used daily security analytics tracking to stop individual Phosphorus attacks and
notify impacted customers, the action we executed last week enabled us to take control of
websites that are core to its operations. Our work to track Phosphorus over multiple years
and observe its activity enabled us to build a decisive legal case and execute last week’s
action with confidence we could have significant impact on the group’s infrastructure.
The action we executed last week enabled us to take control of 99 websites and redirect
traffic from infected devices to our Digital Crime Unit’s sinkhole. The intelligence we collect
from this sinkhole will be added to MSTIC’s existing knowledge of Phosphorus and shared
with Microsoft security products and services to improve detections and protections for our
customers.
Throughout the course of tracking Phosphorus, we’ve worked closely with a number of other
technology companies, including Yahoo, to share threat information and jointly stop
attacks. We are grateful for their partnership. We also worked with each domain listing
company listed in our suit prior to filing it and are grateful for their support and help in
transferring the website domains registered by Phosphorus to us once a court order was
granted. Our case against Phosphorus is similar to cases we’ve filed against another threat
group called Strontium. We have used this approach 15 times to take control of 91 fake
websites associated with Strontium. The legal filings in our case against Phosphorus can be
found here.
