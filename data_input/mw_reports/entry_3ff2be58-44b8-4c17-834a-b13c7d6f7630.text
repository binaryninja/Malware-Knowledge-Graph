Cryptocurrency Exchanges Targeted by the CryptoCore Group
Background
In recent years, cryptocurrency exchanges have become targets for constant attacks, mainly from
criminal groups and lone hackers. Threat actors of all kinds try to infiltrate corporate networks for
reconnaissance, ransomware deployment, and plainly to steal money from those exchanges, specifically
from their "hot" (i.e. active, connected) wallets. This kind of targets is somewhat unique, different from
traditional financial institutions for two reasons:
•

•

Banks in general, and the SWIFT system in particular, are perceived as highly secured targets in
comparison to cryptocurrency exchanges. The lower security of those exchanges’ networks rises
their potential as a lucrative target for cybercriminals.
While at first it seems easier to track the stolen money through blockchain, identifying and
attributing wallets to entities and individuals is generally more difficult.

From the top 3 attacks against Coinbase, Upbit, and Binance (which was hacked at least twice and had
its KYC1 leaked), to smaller-scale but still sophisticated attacks, such as those carried out by the DPRKattributed group "Lazarus" (aka HIDDEN COBRA), or the exploitation of vulnerabilities in the Ethereum
platform in the (ultimately unsuccessful) attack on Uniswap and Lenf.me2, attacks against cryptoexchanges had had a discernible place in the 2019-early 2020 landscape.
In this research we would like to present a hidden and persistent group, that has been targeting cryptoexchanges, mainly in the US and Japan since as early as 2018, stealing millions' worth of cryptocoins; we
track it as "CryptoCore" (or “Crypto-gang”), aka “Dangerous Password”3, “Leery Turtle”4.
Unlike other reports about this threat actor, the CryptoCore report mainly focuses on the group’s profile,
modus operandi, and digital infrastructure. The “Dangerous Password” and “Leery Turtle” reports zoom
in on different aspects of the operation (e.g. toolset, anti-software detection capabilities) and provide
complementary findings to what is presented in this report.
We will briefly introduce the report with a general overview, and then proceed to discuss in detail its
tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and also present one case study from our experience. We will
conclude with a list of indicators of compromise (IoC).
To all future targeted cryptocurrency exchanges, we encourage your IR team to validate malicious
activity with our findings to fingerprint and mitigate additional CryptoCore operations. For further help,
please reach us out at info@clearskysec.com.
"Know Your Customer" – a fairly common practice by crypto-exchanges to ask their customers to provide some
identification documents and/or photos

Introducing CryptoCore
CryptoCore is a group that targets, as mentioned above, almost exclusively cryptocurrency exchanges
and companies working with them via supply-chain attack. Although we have seen singular infections in
different countries, the group seems to focus on the United States, Japan, and other countries.
The CryptoCore group is known for having accumulated a sum of approximately 70mil USD from its
heists on exchanges. We estimate that the group managed to rake in more than 200mil USD in two years.
This group is not extremely technically advanced, yet it seems to be swift, persistent, and effective,
nevertheless. We assess it to be active at least since May 2018, judging from the timestamp of the first
known relevant sample, and it maintained steady activity since then. Its activity has receded in the first
half of 2020, one possible reason being the limitations induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, but it didn't
stop completely.

Figure 1: CryptoCore operations timeline

Attribution
We have been tracking CryptoCore group campaigns for almost two years, with no conclusive
understanding of the operators’ origin; however, we assess with medium level of certainty that the threat
actor has links to the East European region, Ukraine, Russia or Romania in particular.

Modus Operandi
The key goal of CryptoCore’s heists is to gain access to cryptocurrency exchanges’ wallets, be it general
corporate wallets or wallets belonging to the exchange’s employees. For this kind of operation, the group
begins with an extensive reconnaissance phase against the company, its executives, officers and IT
personnel. While the group’s key infiltration vector to the exchange is usually through spear-phishing
against the corporate network, the executives’ personal email accounts are the first to be targeted.
Infiltrating the personal email accounts is an optional phase; however, it’s a matter of hours to weeks
until the spear-phishing email is sent to a corporate email account of an exchange’s executive.
The spear-phishing is typically carried out by impersonating a high-ranking employee either from the
target organization or from another organization (e.g. advisory board) with connections to the targeted
employee. After gaining initial foothold, the group’s primary objective is obtaining access to the victim’s
password manager account. This is where the keys of crypto-wallets and other valuable assets – which
will come handy in lateral movement stages – are stored. The group will remain undetected and
maintain persistence until the multi-factor authentication of the exchange wallets will be removed, and
then act immediately and responsively.

CryptoCore Group’s Main Characteristics
•

•

•
•

•

•

•

Persistence and adherence to same general TTPs and targets – the group maintains the
same general course of action regarding the infection and post-exploitation stages. While the
bait document type, the services the phishing sites mimic, the exact tooling and others may vary,
an overarching strategy remains the same. Also, the group seems to be reluctant to let go of a
target: in some cases that we have investigated, the group keeps attacking the same company
over and over. The group also appears to steadily use the same titles for its bait documents and
even some payloads.
Use of Cloud services, particularly – but not limited to – Google Drive – the group often
uses Google Drive as the storage for its files, specifically the baits. Sometimes, the phishing
emails contain links claiming to be from Drive, while actually directing to a copycat site, and
sometimes it uses the actual Drive service. Again, Drive is not the only service they use, it's just
common.
Use of malicious cryptocurrency-themed domains such as btcprime[.]tk, krypitalvc[.]com,
blockchaintransparency[.]institute and the like.
Use of bit.ly URL shortening service – the group uses this service widely for its
communications, specifically to deploy scripts and files for further infection. The service has two
main advantages for the group's operators: first, it allows to mask a suspiciously looking link
behind a neutral bit.ly link; second, it provides the attacker with click statistics, which allow them
to track the number of potential infections and their geographical spread.
Use of LNK shortcuts as downloaders – we have seen the attackers hide LNK shortcuts behind
icons and titles of other file types, mostly text files. Sometimes it could be a password file needed
to open the main document, sometimes it could be the main document that is actually a
shortcut, but LNK files are a staple for this group. These files are used to connect to the
command and control (C2) server and download next-stage files.
Use of Visual Basic Script (VBS) files – one distinct characteristic of the group is a relatively
heavy use of VBS files both as downloaders and as backdoors. What appears to be the main
backdoor of the group is also a VBS file (tracked by Proofpoint Emerging Threats as
CageyChameleon), rather than an executable or an in-memory payload. We are not sure why
VBS, but we can assume that these files are deemed lighter and less prone to detections, as
opposed to, say, EXE or DLL files. However, in singular cases we have seen the group
downloading and using the Mimikatz password-dumping tool as well, so VBS files are not the
only tools used in post-exploitation.

Swiftness and responsiveness – the group's infrastructure is continuously and rapidly
changing. While in some cases we have seen the same infrastructures being constantly reused,
perhaps against multiple victims, the group is generally quick to register and employ new
domains and links. In some cases, the freshly created bit.ly link is used immediately, on the same
day; in one case, a new domain was registered, we have alerted the client, and within 30-40
minutes their systems identified an attack from that new domain.

CryptoCore Infrastructure Insights:
1) CryptoCore Working Time Zone
In attempt to better understand the origin of CryptoCore operators, we have collected the Whois
registration dates of C&C domains. After data cleaning, a plot of the distribution of Whois registration
records showed no distinct time zone. As shown in the chart below, as for UTC+0, the operators do
not register their C&C domains in certain working hours.

Figure 2: CryptoCore C&C Whois registration records by hour
2) CryptoCore operators use dedicated IP addresses where they host their C&C domains. These IPs
are associated with AS networks located in multiple countries, mainly the United States, Taiwan,
Brazil, Egypt, Mongolia, and Thailand (in descending order).
3) C&C TLD to Registrar & Nameserver Distribution
CryptoCore group mostly registers dedicated C&C domains, using the .xyz TLD via NameCheap
registrar services. Moreover, the operators register all dedicated C&C domains that are associated
with the .info TLD via NameSilo registrar services. The hostname usually contains keywords that
resemble names of cloud services (also through typo-squatting). They frequently use the known TLD
.com, alongside gTLDs containing meaningful words to mislead the victims, such as .email, .services,
etc. In addition, it appears that the threat group prefers PublicDomainRegistry and NameSilo
registrars; however, these are not the only registrars used.

Figure 3: CryptoCore C&C TLD Distribution
4) Anomalous Registration of multiple C&C Domains in 3 Days
Usually, CryptoCore operators do not register multiple C&C domains on the same day, except on
special occasions. One company was targeted by CryptoCore in July 2018, two months before the
group registered 10 domains within 3 days. This may indicate that the group's operators were aware
that their digital infrastructure has been discovered, so they have started quickly setting up new
digital infrastructure in a few days.
In addition, they tend to register a new C&C domain once or twice a month until this day.
5) CryptoCore operators re-register expired C&C domains
This may suggest the attackers’ intent to reuse the infrastructure for different ongoing campaigns, as
well as future ones. In addition, it emphasizes that year-old domains are still in use, and hence
should be blocked for long periods.
6) Use of DDNS services till 2019
In 2018 and 2019, CryptoCore operators had heavily relied on DDNS services such as dynu (dynu.com,
kozow.com, theworkpc.com), ChangeIP (onmypc.org, itemdb.com, itsaol.com) and
DNSExit/Netdorm (linkpc.net, publicvm.com). However, in 2020 we have observed an uptick in
registering new domains and pointing C&C domains to dedicated servers.

Infection Chain
The following diagram shows the general infection pattern of CryptoCore, as presented in a research
published independently by the Japanese CERT and dealing with CryptoCore's activity in Japan5.

Figure 4: CryptoCore's TTP outline as presented in JPCERT's research

CryptoCore TTPs
As previously mentioned, the campaign begins with an extensive reconnaissance stage against the
company, it’s executives, IT managers and key employees. Optionally, the group operators gain access to
private email accounts of executives in the targeted cryptocurrency exchange. The next stage would be
spear-phishing, typically impersonating a high-ranking employee, either from the target company itself
or from a company that deals with the target. The email's quality is not consistent and can vary from
almost generic-looking phishing email with a shared link (see Figure 5), to a well-crafted email that is only
slightly flawed (see Figure 6).

Figure 7: An href attribute leads to a bit.ly link instead of Google Drive
While the link in the email states that its destination is Google Drive, it really leads to malicious landing
page with a similarly-sounding name. The true link is served via an HTML href attribute, shortened with
bit.ly, probably for analysis obstruction and statistics' collection as bit.ly allows its users to track the
shortened link's clicks. In parallel, another bit.ly connection will be established, using an <img> HTML tag

probably containing the company's logo and the second bit.ly link. However, this tactic in not a
consistent characteristic of Crypto Core, as it has only been observed once until now – in most cases the
link will not hide behind another link but rather lead to the download.

Figure 8: a code snippet with the link in the <img> tag
Clicking the link in the email will result in a compressed file being downloaded to the target computer.
This file will typically contain two additional files – a bait document (DOC, PDF or XLS) that is passwordprotected, and an LNK file disguised as a text file with the password (see Figure 9). However, in singular
cases we have seen the password file being a text file indeed, while the password-protected bait initiated
the connection with the C2 server (see Figure 10)

Figure 9: the LNK file

Figure 10: the txt file
Usually, the LNK file will present the target with a text file containing the password and at the same time
it will also download a malicious VBS script, also through a bit.ly-shortened URL. At this point, the
campaigns slightly differ, specifically those presented in the JPCERT/CC report6.
In the Japanese case, in addition to presenting the password, the LNK also creates and runs a VBS file in
%TEMP%, and also lists the processes running on target computer, looking for specific strings: "hudongf"
or "qhsafe", which are suspected to represent the "zhudongfangyu.exe" and "qhsafemain.exe" processes
of the Quihoo360 security solutions suite. If those are absent, an LNK file, named "xBoxOne.lnk", will be
added to the Startup folder, making it run every time a user logs into the infected computer; if one of
those strings is present in the process list, no further action will be taken. The Japanese CERT was unable

to confirm, as of June 2019, the LNK's ultimate purpose, however, given the fact that it sits in the Startup
folder, we assume it to give the attackers persistence on the target.
As for the VBS created in %TEMP%, it acts as a downloader for another VBS. That VBS collects the
following information:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Username
Host name
OS version, install date and run time
Time zone
CPU name
Execution path of the VBS in %TEMP%
Network adapter information
List of running processes

The information is sent to the C2 server every minute, and it expects additional VBS as a response. The
JPCERT couldn't confirm the nature of this latter-stage payload.
In the cases observed by us, manual execution of the LNK file initiates the infection chain. While the user
is presented with the password for the bait document, the compromised host performs a one-time
communication with the C2 to download a VBS payload identified as VBS/CageyChameleon by
Proofpoint’s Emerging Threats service. This VBS collects the same information as the one mentioned in
the Japanese case, i.e. username, OS, time zone etc. The cases differ, then, in the intermediate stages
between the "password" file's opening and the activation of the stage 2 payload – in the Japanese case
there are additional stages (e.g. the presence of oezjrjua.vbs), not seen by us.

Figure 11: the second stage VBS payload identified as part of the campaign
As already mentioned, the group makes extensive use of the legitimate bit.ly shortening service in its
communications. The service not only allows the attacker to hide their links behind innocuously looking
shortcuts, but also provides them with click statistics. It’s worth the mention that those statistics used to
be publicly viewable, roughly until early 2020, but are currently open only to the links’ creators.

Figure 12: Statistics provided for the attacker through one of the links
As depicted in Figure 12, CryptoCore operators tend to use their bit.ly links to a limited number of highly
targeted victims originated in different countries. They reuse the same bit.ly links, using them
continuously for 3-7 days, as seen in December 2019 and January 2020 (Figure 12).
Another characteristic of the group is communicating with the C2 server through the 8080 port with the
target's unique identifier appended usually to an “id” parameter, or, rarely, to a “topic” parameter:
a. <C2 domain>:8080/edit?(<id or topic>)=<unique_identifier>
b. <C2 domain>:8080/open?(<id or topic>)=<unique_identifier>
c. <DDNS C2 subdomain>:8080/search.php

CryptoCore in action: Case Study
We have presented out main understandings about the group, now we would like to demonstrate it in
action, through one case that we have investigated this March.
That morning, we've notified one of our clients about freshly discovered CryptoCore indicators. The
client informed us, that roughly 30-40 minutes after we've sent the notification their systems identified
an attack through the new infrastructure.

The attack began with a phishing email impersonating the client's CEO and supposedly containing some
new instructions which should be distributed and acquainted with by the employees. The email was
written in fairly good local language, but it was nevertheless imperfect and with odd punctuation. What's
more is that communications inside the company are conducted mostly in English, so however good was
the language used by the operators, it was still suspicious.
Analyzing the emails headers, we saw it being initially sent from a computer belonging to the Italian
hosting company "Aruba". Moreover, the link written in the email was supposedly leading to Google
Spreadsheets, while the <href> actually contained a bit.ly link and the Spreadsheets link was just a ruse.
The true link led to a page mimicking Google Drive and registered that same morning.

Figure 13: The newly registered page being employed right away
For the second stage, another bit.ly link was used, leading to a page created in late February:

Figure 14: Use of another bit.ly link that was created in late February
During the attack, we suspect the group also employing Mimikatz for credentials harvesting.
