IcedID is somewhat of a veteran in the MaaS industry, being actively developed and
distributed since 2017. The malware-as-a-service, also called Bokbot, has been in extensive
use in the last couple of months by malspam distributors. Its latest version is delivered using
a malicious Microsoft office attachment, which eventually drops and executes the IcedID
payload.
The specific Excel document used in the recent wave of attacks is using XLM macros to
download and execute its payload. Although the XLM macro technology is quite old, it is only
recently that Microsoft added detection capabilities for XLM macros. This explains why so
many threat actors have chosen to spread their malware using this archaic capability.
The malicious document uses the windows API URLDownloadToFile in order to download
the IcedID payload to the path C:\Users\Public\microsoft.security, which it later executes
using the WMIC binary.
This is a sample of the de-obfuscated macro:

The De-Obfuscated IcedID macro

The latest update to IcedID also saw a significant change to its first stage loading
mechanism, which was dubbed “gziploader” by Binary Defense’s researchers. The new
update uses a custom encryption algorithm to decrypt the actual bot which is hidden inside
the file “licenses.dat”.
The malware’s development is especially concerning because of its collaboration with
Sodinokibi (aka REvil) ransomware group, as reported by the DFIR Report. Their latest blog
post’s details a breach starting with an IcedID infection that was escalated to a full-on
ransomware attack in just under 6 hours, fully encrypting the fake corporate network used by
the researchers.
