“You’re fired…..NOT!” An ongoing and rapidly evolving spear phishing campaign is threatening targets with
false claims of employment termination due to economic impacts from the global pandemic, among
numerous other coercive tactics. The goal of the attacker is to intimidate employees into clicking on a link
that will ultimately lead to Bazar or Buer malware infections by way of Trickbot.
Disruption Efforts
Researchers at Zscaler ThreatLabZ reported on similar activity, where they noted this was the first time
they have seen both Bazar and Buer malware strains used together. Additionally, they have associated the
activity with the Trickbot gang, known to use a combination of different malware groups and bots to conduct
attacks.
While Trickbot started out as a banking trojan, known for hijacking victims’ browser sessions once logged
into their banking website, it has since been repeatedly repurposed for other objectives, including the ability
to spread ransomware. This particularly maniacal and disruptive aspect of Trickbot functionality made it a
top contender for possible cybersecurity threats to the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
With ransomware as an option, Trickbot posed a significant threat to U.S. election infrastructure. The
malware’s operators had the ability to compromise a massive number of voting machines during critical
times in vote counting, undermining trust in the result. That, or they may have even been able to disrupt the
voting process altogether by affecting entire voting locations, preventing large portions of the voter
population from casting their ballots.
This could explain the recent wave of Trickbot takedown efforts. A report from KrebsonSecurity provided
details of an operation that likely began on September 22nd and is conjectured to be a government
counter-strike against the actors behind Trickbot. This activity, first identified by Intel471 and possibly
conducted by the U.S. Cyber Command, attempted to disrupt Trickbot infrastructure by forcing the botnet’s
controllers to issue bogus configurations.
1/11

These configurations swapped real controller IP addresses for the localhost address (127.0.0.1), preventing
bots from calling home to receive commands. Not long after the phony configurations were sent, all known
controllers appeared to have stopped properly responding to bot requests, suggesting the overall activity
was a concerted, intentional effort to disrupt this pervasive botnet’s operations.
Another attempt was made on October 1st, presumably by U.S. Cyber Command, that similarly altered the
controller IP addresses needed to receive commands. Compounding the effects of this effort, Microsoft also
attempted disruptions of Trickbot infrastructure by obtaining a court order to disable the botnet’s IP
addresses, among other actions. Most recently, Microsoft issued an update that they successfully took
down 62 of the 69 Trickbot servers around the world with the remaining being unorthodox IOT devices.
However, these attempts reportedly would only have a short-term effect on Trickbot controllers since its
operators use decentralized infrastructure that communicates over Tor, with blockchain-based EmerDNS as
a fallback that is resistant to takedowns. Additionally, Ars Technica reports that Trickbot controllers are
beginning to host their malware on other e-criminals’ servers.
Area 1 Security’s Findings on Trickbot Payloads
Unsurprisingly, not long after the previously mentioned Trickbot takedown operations occurred, Area 1
Security identified a prolific phishing campaign that intended to spread Bazar and Buer payloads via
Trickbot. Worse yet, this newer stealthy malware in Trickbot gang’s arsenal of tools can be used to deploy
additional malware, including ransomware.
Area 1 Security researchers found evidence that the BazarLoader dropped in this campaign will not
continue with the infection if the locale of the victim’s device is in Russia, a common tactic seen
with Trickbot.
In fact, cyber security researchers believe Trickbot is the handiwork of cybercriminals operating out of
Russia. Since at least 2019, this group has been responsible for a surge in ransomware attacks targeting
schools systems, local governments and even law enforcement agencies in the United States.
Potential for Election Interference
While these e-criminal groups have always been operating at some level in recent years, their activity has
surged in the lead-up to the 2020 U.S. Presidential election. This suggests that entities involved in the U.S.
election are prime targets for foreign adversaries, both nation-state and cybercriminal groups alike.
Lining up with the recent FBI/DNI press conference, Russian and Iranian state-sponsored groups are
confirmed to have exfiltrated voter registration information. Additionally, these nations are behind separate
email spoofing campaigns designed to undermine faith in the U.S. election.
At the moment, it is unclear if the phishing campaign that Area 1 Security identified is being carried out by
any of these groups or if it is purposefully targeting election administrators. Regardless, state and local
election administrators should be extra vigilant as they tend to be highly vulnerable to phishing attacks, as
highlighted in Area 1 Security’s recent “Phishing Election Administrators” report.
Threatening Phishing Lures
The recent phishing campaign that Area 1 Security discovered uses a number of lures that threaten job
termination in order to intimidate employees into clicking on a provided URL. The phishing messages are
very simple in their demand, and appear to originate from persons of authority within the targeted company,
as seen in the phishing email below (Figure 1).

2/11

[Figure 1. Phishing Messages that Threaten Job Security]
The messages identified in this campaign are based on eliciting fear from the target audience, focusing on
either employment termination or customer complaints.
The massive remote workforce transition, and the resultant decrease in face-to-face contact, gives
attackers the advantage by making email delivery of these types of “employment notifications” all the more
believable.
Targets of this campaign could potentially believe that the post-COVID shake up in their organizations is the
reason they’re being let go. With many businesses closing down unusable office space, combined with an
economic recession, there is enough plausibility for this wide-ranging phishing attack to fool
employees into believing that their position may be part of the now all-too-common budget cuts.
It’s possible this Bazar and Buer campaign is part of the Trickbot operations that Microsoft and other
partners are trying to defeat. If so, the activity Area 1 Security observed only further proves just how difficult
it can be to counteract these complex malware operations.
With these Trickbot operations, threat actors have a litany of unique and ever-changing email accounts and
IP addresses to execute their attacks. Despite the previously mentioned efforts to neutralize Trickbot
controllers, the infrastructure used to support this particular campaign (if associated in any way) was hardly
affected, and the attacker seems to have promptly resumed operations.
While disruption operations may have worked a decade ago, the Trickbot gang and other groups that rely
on their Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) offering are equipped with the necessary skills to continue their
attacks without a hitch. Current botnets have all the professionalism of any IT company. They’re able to
manage disruptions and bring back services with continuity planning, backups, automated deployment, and
a dedicated workforce.
The campaign noted above centered on termination-related documents available at a provided URL. When
clicked, the link directs the victim’s browser to either Google Docs or Constant Contact. By not attaching the
malware as a file to the email, the attacker is able to bypass file scanning detections.
Moreover, attackers commonly use cloud-based hosting services to circumvent URL scanning techniques,
and to easily create new malicious links in the event that their URLs are identified as phishing pages.
3/11

The Google Docs or Constant Contact link in the phishing email leads to a decoy preview page, as shown
in Figure 2, that prompts the victim to open a list of terminated employees. The decoy also cleverly displays
the often seen “If download does not start, click here”. This link is where the malware is actually being
hosted.
At the moment, it is unclear if the phishing campaign that Area 1 Security identified is being carried out by
any of these groups or if it is purposefully targeting election administrators. Regardless, state and local
election administrators should be extra vigilant as they tend to be highly vulnerable to phishing attacks, as
highlighted in Area 1 Security’s recent “Phishing Election Administrators” report.
Threatening Phishing Lures
The recent phishing campaign that Area 1 Security discovered uses a number of lures that threaten job
termination in order to intimidate employees into clicking on a provided URL. The phishing messages are
very simple in their demand, and appear to originate from persons of authority within the targeted company,
as seen in the phishing email below (Figure 1).

Analysis of Bazar and Buer Malware

4/11

As seen in the figure below, after clicking on the link found in the online document, the victim is presented
with a dialog box to run the file. The file is actually a malicious PE32+ executable that is designed to run on
all Windows systems.

[Figure 3. Gaining Run Permission]
After clicking “Run,” a series of events will take place on the victim’s device that will ultimately lead to
installation of the Bazar backdoor or Buer loader.
First, the PE32+ executable noted above will decrypt the payload using an RC4 cipher, a portion of which is
provided in Figure 4 below. The payload happens to be none other than Trickbot, and typically the RC4 key
is changed for each iteration of the malware.

[Figure 4. RC4 decryption of Trickbot Payload]
As detailed in Figure 5, Area 1 Security researchers identified the string “dave” at the end of the Trickbot
payload in memory, which is consistent with prior reporting on techniques employed by Emotet and Trickbot
malware developers. This string reveals the attacker’s use of a custom packer to compress and encrypt the
file, making it difficult for malware researchers to analyze the payload.

5/11

[Figure 5. “Dave” signature]
Despite this anti-reversing technique, Area 1 Security discovered the Trickbot payload attempts to further
infect the victim device by decrypting and running the BazarLoader.
What are malware loaders? Loaders are an essential function that allow attackers to gain a foothold in a
network and enable subsequent, more persistent infection via their command and control servers. This
tactic opts for stealth by initially loading as little functionality as necessary.
In this case, the BazarLoader in turn attempts to download the Bazar backdoor via a blockchain DNS
lookup table. This is a great tactic for attackers as it circumvents the need for registrars, giving full
ownership of the blockchain domain to the attackers. This way, domain custodians like GoDaddy or Google
Domains can’t seize the domain if malicious activity is observed, nor will they have the ability to share
information about the domain if served a court order.
Similar to bitcoin, Top Level Domains (TLDs) like .bit, .bazar, and .coin are not owned by a single authority
but instead shared over peer-to-peer networks. This offers users the ability to bypass censorship and other
government restrictions, but also provides a platform for attackers to conduct illicit activities that are safe
from typical countermeasures.
As shown in Figure 6, to download the backdoor, the loader loops through eight unique IP addresses and
five domains under the EmerDNS .bazar TLD.

6/11

[Figure 6. Attempted Outbound Connections to Download the Bazar Backdoor]
The second level domains are comprised of 12 alphabetical characters that are generated using a specific
domain generation algorithm. The malware runs through the list of generated .bazar domains to find one
that is still actively hosting the backdoor.
Once the backdoor is downloaded and successfully run, that attacker can carry out any number of
devious acts, including remotely executing commands, exfiltrating sensitive data, and deploying
other payloads. These additional payloads range anywhere from post-exploitation frameworks like
CobaltStrike to ransomware like Ryuk.
In fact, Trickbot is known to deliver Ryuk ransomware to devices via BazarLoader. In one instance, after the
initial Bazar infection, attackers exploited a recently disclosed vulnerability to escalate privileges and gain
domain-wide ransomware infection just five hours after sending their phishing message.
This is unfortunately just one of many possible outcomes that can result from successful infection via this
Trickbot phishing campaign we intercepted.
How to Stop Evolving Trickbot Campaigns

7/11

The threat actors behind this campaign leveraged a number of sophisticated techniques to easily evade
legacy vendors and cloud email providers. Linking to legitimate, cloud-based sites within the phishing
messages, combined with the use of takedown- and sinkhole-resistant EmerDNS TLDs, makes this a
particularly difficult campaign for standard defenses to detect.
Area 1 Security‘s advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence technology allow our algorithms to
uncover the clever tactics seen in this campaign, enabling us to block the messages in real time instead of
waiting days or weeks for signature updates. Our time-zero detections lead the industry with reliable
verdicts that stop phishing attempts at delivery time.
This means that malware like Trickbot, the Bazar backdoor, and follow-on infection with ransomware, never
have the opportunity to make their way onto our customers’ devices. The key to stopping sophisticated
malware campaigns such as these is a preemptive approach, which has many advantages over postdelivery retraction, and prevents the user from ever being exposed to the attack.
