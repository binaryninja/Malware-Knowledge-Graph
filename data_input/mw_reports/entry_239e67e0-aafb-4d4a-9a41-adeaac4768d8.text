The BlackBerry Research & Intelligence Team

Summary
RedLine is a new infostealer malware family that is distributed via COVID-19 phishing email
campaigns. It has been active throughout 2020, and in 2021, it has additionally been
delivered through malicious Google advertisements and spearphishing campaigns against
3D or digital artists using non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are digital tokens tied to assets
that can be bought, sold and traded.
RedLine is extremely versatile and has appeared variously as Trojanized services, games,
cracks, and tools. Many samples of RedLine also appear with legit-looking digital
certificates.
Once connection to its command and control (C2) panel is established, RedLine malware
has a wide range of applications and services. In all cases it attempts to perform illicit
exfiltration of victims’ data. The malware gathers information from web-browsers, file

transfer protocol (FTP) clients, Instant Messengers (IM), cryptocurrency wallets, VPN
services, and gaming clients. It also has remote functionality to drop and execute further
malware onto the victim machine.

Operating System

Risk & Impact

Infection Vectors
The RedLine malware family has been distributed and sold mostly via Russian
underground malware forums. This threat has been sold as individual packages with
several pricing options, or as Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) on a subscription-based
pricing package.
As the malware is distributed, the threat group behind it does not have a singular goal or
target other than generating revenue by selling the malware. It is then used in multiple
smaller campaigns by the individual threat actors who have purchased the malware online.
Due to this, there are a wide array of known infection vectors, malware campaigns and
targets that have been hit by the RedLine malware family.
In the last few months, RedLine has been noted being delivered by the following
mechanisms:
An initial malware downloader
Email malspam campaigns
Being hosted on Bitbucket
Being hosted on paste[.]nrecom[.]net
Abusing Google Ads hosting Trojanized lure websites
Being Trojanized as popular services ‘Telegram’ and ‘Signal’
Social engineering campaigns to attack digital artists using Non-Fungible Tokens

Throughout its development and lifecycle, RedLine has evolved to be more complex, and it
has increased the list of data it can exfiltrate. At the time of writing in July 2021, this threat
appears to be in active development, increasing its capabilities further.

Technical Analysis
Fingerprinting
RedLine samples tend to be heavily obfuscated .NET compiled executables. As this
malware is being widely distributed by threat actors with different skills and goals, the
complexity of this obfuscation can vary sample-to-sample:

3/19

Figure 1: De-obfuscated .NET functions of a RedLine sample.
Upon execution, the malware will initialize both the Command and Control (C2) server’s IP
address, and the hardcoded ‘Build ID’ found within each sample. The malware utilizes
SOAP messaging protocol for its C2 connections.
RedLine will check for Internet connectivity before reaching out to its malicious C2
infrastructure to obtain further settings. Once this is complete, the malware will begin by
fingerprinting the victim’s device for the following characteristics:

4/19

Hardware ID

Operating System Version

Build ID

Current Language

Username

Monitor Size/Screen Resolution

Process Elevation

Time/Date

Country/Location

Time Zone

IP Address

Screenshotting device

User-Agent

RAM info

Graphic Card info

System Defender/Antivirus

The malware contains multiple functions that aid in the fingerprinting of a victim device.
These functions range greatly in both depth and complexity. Some can be simple functions
and routines for getting a device’s ‘computer architecture’. Others can enlist a wide range of
IP and geolocation Web APIs for anti-analysis and to prevent location spoofing:

Figure 2: RedLine uses multiple geolocation and IP address web-based APIs.
When fingerprinting the device, the malware has notable functions called ‘Blacklisted
Country’ and ‘Blocked IP’. These functions are populated when a connection has been
established by the C2. The threat actor can decide whether these could be used to prevent
5/19

infection of devices based on the specific location of a new victim, or by using a specific IP
address.

Information Stealing – File Grabber
Once infected, RedLine will attempt to find further information from a victim’s device,
including the following:
Default/set browser
The location of specified files
Instant Messenger clients
File paths and fingerprinting:
ProgramData folder
Program Files folder
Program Files (x86) folder

Information Stealing – Browsers
RedLine’s core functionality is centered around information stealing. One of the ways it
achieves this is by targeting the following web-browsers:
Chromium-based browsers (Chrome)
Gecko-based browsers (Mozilla Firefox)
Microsoft Edge
The malware takes a keen interest in collecting data from these browsers to exfiltrate the
following from the victim:
Login and password credentials
Browser cookies
Auto-complete/auto-fill fields used by websites
Credit card details
Each web-browser stores this information in unique locations. This threat has dedicated
functions and routines per-browser, to maximize its reach and the damage it can cause. All
stolen information is exfiltrated back to its C2 on a timer:

Information Stealing – VPN Clients
With the growing popularity of Virtual Private Network (VPN) services, many malware
families have been targeting the login credentials of these services. RedLine in particular
targets the following services:
NordVPN
ProtonVPN
OpenVPN

Information Stealing – Crypto Wallets
With the recent astronomical rise in both interest and investment in cryptocurrencies, digital
wallet details and login credentials have become another lucrative item that many malware
families are beginning to target and add to their arsenal of info-stealing capabilities.
8/19

RedLine has also added multiple functions to harvest and exfiltrate data relating to several
popular crypto wallets. A crypto wallet is an application used to both cold store and retrieve
digital cryptocurrency assets. RedLine has specific functions that target popular crypto
wallet services, as well as more generic functions to widen its scope of asset-stealing.
The following popular wallet services have been targeted by RedLine:
Armory

TronLink

MetaMask

Jaxx

Guarda

Exodus

Atomic

Coinomi

Electrum

The malware also has specific functions targeting different cryptocurrencies specifically:
Ethereum wallets
Monero wallets

Figure 6: RedLine querying the presence of crypto wallets on a victim device.
As well as looking for cold-storage cryptocurrency wallets installed onto a victim device,
RedLine also searches for web-browser extensions related to cryptocurrency applications.
RedLine has a function dedicated to seeking out the presence of other cryptocurrency
services, such as the browser-extensions listed below:
Yoroi

Guarda

TronLink

Equal

Nifty

Jaxx Liberty

MetaMask

BitApp

Math

iWallet

Coinbase

Wombat

BinanceChain

Information Stealing – Instant Messengers
Variants of RedLine attempt to harvest credentials from Instant Messenger (IM) clients.
These IM services have seen a recent rise in popularity, with Discord boasting over 100
million active users.
Some samples of RedLine appeared on Google ads related to another Instant Messenger
service named Telegram in 2021. These advertisements redirected the victim to a fake
Telegram webpage, where a Trojanized sample of RedLine malware was offered up to an
unsuspecting victim, to download and unknowingly execute.
RedLine currently targets the following two clients:
Discord
Telegram
For Telegram, RedLine looks for the folder ‘tdata’, which is typically stored in
%AppData\Roaming\Telegram Desktop\tdata%. This is where the Instant Messenger stores
its session data, including images and conversations.

Information Stealing - Gaming Client
Another extremely popular service the malware goes after is Steam. Steam is a gaming
platform, store, and client that is used by over 120 million active users at the time of writing.
The malware attempts to locate the presence of Steam before attempting to obtain
credentials.
Steam has an in-built store with a lot of ‘Steam accounts’ having various other services and
banking details related to it. RedLine attempts to go after the ‘Steam Sentry File’ which is
used to store credentials:

authorization data.

Information Stealing - FTP Clients
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) clients are another common software tool RedLine attempts to
gather information on. If this information is present, the malware will exfiltrate it. FTP clients
are used for file transfers between a local and remote computing device.
RedLine attempts to target both FileZilla and WinSCP, both of which are free, open-source
applications. In observed samples, the malware will seek out the presence of both
applications, but it does try to obtain more data from FileZilla clients as seen in the list
below:

12/19

FileZilla
Connections
Credentials
Recent
Host
Port
User
Password
WinSCP
Password
Connections

Figure 9: RedLine goes after initially 'recenetservers.xml' and 'sitemanger.xml'.

Remote Tasks
As well as fingerprinting the victim’s device, RedLine has the ability to use further internal
functions to carry out a wide array of malicious activities.
Once a connection with its C2 has been established, RedLine malware can remotely
perform the following functions:
Download further files
Execute and run PE files
Locate specific PE files execute them
Open a requested link
Download and execute updates
Execute a request command via CMD.exe

Conclusion
13/19

Due to the nature and flexibility of RedLine infostealer, the malware family can cause
considerable damage to both enterprise devices as well as personal devices.
In its current state, RedLine appears to be geared towards targeting individuals and their
personal computers. This is highlighted by the malware going after IM services, gaming
clients, FTP applications, and personal crypto wallets.
This does not mean RedLine is incapable of damaging an enterprise system or network,
however. The malware’s File Grabber, Remote Task and Web-Browser stealer functionality
can all be used by a successful threat actor to carve out important information and data
from corporate devices before exfiltrating them.

Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

16/19

At BlackBerry, we take a prevention-first and AI-driven approach to cybersecurity. Putting
prevention first neutralizes malware before the exploitation stage of the kill-chain.
By stopping malware at this stage, BlackBerry® solutions help organizations increase their
resilience. It also helps reduce infrastructure complexity and streamline security
management to keep business, people, and endpoints secure.

17/19

NOTE: Due to the nature of RedLine, the Indicators of Compromise (IoC) vary sample-tosample.
Typically, the malware will attempt to reach out to its embedded C2 information before
attempting to utilize web-based API calls to fingerprint a device.
In some instances, the malware has been known to immediately drop further malware
once a connection has been established.
Example C2:
hXXp://45[.]67[.]228[.]119[:]9851
hXXp://185[.]215[.]113[.]15[:]61506
