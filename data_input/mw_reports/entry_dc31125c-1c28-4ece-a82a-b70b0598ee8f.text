Nucleus Software Exports, an Indian company that provides lending software to banks and
retail stores, has suffered a major ransomware attack that crippled some of its internal
networks and encrypted sensitive business information.
The incident took place last Sunday, on May 30, according to a document the company filed
on Tuesday with the Indian National Stock Exchange authority.

In a quarterly report filed on Thursday, NSE said it’s in the process of containing the damage
and recovering and restoring impacted systems.
“So far as sensitive data is concerned, we’d like to assure our customers that there is NO
financial data of any customer available/stored with us and therefore the question of any
leakage or loss of client data does not arise,” the company told Indian financial regulators.
But while an NSE spokesperson has declined to comment on the attack on several
occasions, members of the cyber-security community have been able to track down
the ransomware strain that was deployed on the company’s network.

The ransomware, identified as BlackCocaine, but more commonly known as EpsilonRed, is
among the most recent ransomware strains discovered.
First spotted last month by UK security firm Sophos, the EpsilonRed gang works by targeting
unpatched Microsoft Exchange email servers vulnerable to the ProxyLogon exploit, getting a
foothold on the vulnerable system, and then deploying a collection of PowerShell scripts to
allow it to move internally inside a victim’s network.
In its report, Sophos said the ransomware gang has been successful in at least some of their
attacks, discovering payments of $210,000 from previous incidents.
While NSE has not confirmed that the entry point for their breach was an Exchange server
nor if it paid the ransom demand, the incident proves that even with tools that Sophos
described as “bare-bones,” a ransomware gang was capable of infiltrating a major financial
software supplier and hold it for ransom with little effort.
But because the ransomware is still new, its code is not yet top-notch. An Emsisoft malware
analyst, which took a look at the BlackCocaine/EpsilonRed sample, recommended that
companies to reach out in case of an attack, as there might be ways to recover files under
certain conditions.
