In the last five years, JavaScript sniffers have grown into one of the most dangerous threats
for e-commerce businesses. The simple nature of such attacks combined with the use of
malicious JavaScript code for intercepting payment data attract more and more
cybercriminals, and JS-sniffers became one of the most prominent sources of stolen bank
cards on underground markets. However, in one recent campaign we saw a big step forward
in attacks on e-commerce websites involving JS-sniffers.

In July 2020, Sansec published an article about the attacks on US and European online
shops with the use of JavaScript sniffers (JS-sniffers). The researchers attributed the
"clientToken=" campaign to the North Korean APT called Lazarus (aka Dark Seoul Gang,
HIDDEN COBRA, Guardians of Peace, APT38, APT-C-26, Labyrinth Chollima, Zinc,
Bluenoroff, Stardust Chollima).
The Group-IB Threat Intelligence team looked deeper into these campaigns and identified
another campaign involving the same infrastructure. The threat actor went back to the old
habit of stealing crypto using a never-before-seen tool. Lazarus attacked online stores
which accept cryptocurrency payments through crypto skimmers: JS-sniffers modified for the
purpose of stealing crypto currency. Some victims, identified by Sansec, in fact, didn't fell
prey to the clientToken= campaign, but to a different, previously undocumented Lazarus
campaign, codenamed BTC Changer by Group-IB researchers. Group-IB's TI&A team
identified BTC addresses used by Lazarus and have analyzed the transactions. Group-IB
found additional evidence of Lazarus involvement in the campaigns.
Group-IB researchers analyzed the newly discovered attacks, described the links with the
clientToken= campaign, analyzed the transactions associated with the wallets controlled by
the gang, and estimated Lazarus' profits from the use of crypto-stealing JS-sniffers at
0.89993859 BTC ($8,446.55 at the moment of the transaction and $52,611 as of April 9,
2021) and 4.384719 ETH, ($9,047 as of April 9, 2021).
Initial discovery
The clientToken= campaign conducted by Lazarus and identified by Sansec started in May
2019. During the campaign, the attackers used a list of compromised websites for hosting
malicious JavaScript files to steal bank card information from European and US online
shoppers:
stefanoturco[.]com
technokain[.]com
darvishkhan[.]net
areac-agr[.]com
luxmodelagency[.]com
signedbooksandcollectibles[.]com
The same compromised websites were also used as gates for receiving collected payment
information from infected websites. Links to JavaScript files on compromised websites were
injected into the source code of various online shops.
Group-IB researchers discovered that, in late February 2020, Lazarus started using a
modified version of the malicious JavaScript script that was initially used during the
clientToken= campaign all the while using the same infrastructure. The new version had the
same names of functions, but bank card harvesting was replaced with cryptocurrency

skimming and they started targeting companies who accepted payments in BTC. The new
version of the malicious JavaScript, which Group-IB researchers named Lazarus BTC
Changer, was designed to switch the destination payment address to the attackers' BTC
address.

To store malicious JavaScript files, the attackers used compromised the website
luxmodelagency[.]com, just like with the clientToken= campaign. In some cases, they also
used internal JavaScript files of the infected websites as storage for malicious JavaScript.
Analysis of Lazarus BTC Changer campaign
INFECTED WEBSITES
While analyzing Lazarus BTC Changer, we identified three compromised websites, two of
which were listed in Sansec's article as victims of the clientToken= campaign: "Realchems"
(https://realchems.com/) and "Wongs Jewellers" (https://www.wongsjewellers.co.uk/). In the
case of Wongs Jewellers, we identified a sample of Lazarus BTC Changer on their website,
but we did not find any evidence that the shop accepts cryptocurrency, so the attackers
probably added Lazarus BTC Changer to the website by mistake. The third victim is an
4/12

Italian luxury clothes shop, but malicious code was removed from the website at the moment
of analysis.
SAMPLES
Like all traditional JS-sniffers, Lazarus BTC Changer detects when users are on the checkout
page of an infected website, but instead of collecting bank card details, it replaces the BTC
or ETH address owned by the shop with an address used by the hackers. A snippet of such
JavaScript code is shown in Figure 2 along with the BTC address used by the attackers
(1MQC6C4FVX8RhmWESWsazEb5dyDBhxH9he) and the ETH address
(0x460ab1c34e4388704c5e56e18D904Ed117D077CC).

In late March 2020, the attackers added a fake web payment form to their arsenal. The form
opens in an iframe element.

Fig. 3: Lazarus BTC Changer with a fake payment form
The fake form (Figure 4) asks that the payment be made directly to the BTC address
controlled by the hackers (1MQC6C4FVX8RhmWESWsazEb5dyDBhxH9he). Despite the
fact that the form mentions one particular target (Realchems), the attackers used the same
5/12

fake form in the samples injected into the source code of the other two target websites.

Fig. 4: Fake payment form, which opens in an iframe element
While analyzing the source code of the fake payment form (Figure 5) Group-IB Threat
Intelligence researchers found that it was saved from the Realchems website using
SingleFile browser extension. For each saved page SingleFile creates a comment with the
URL address of the page and the saved date using Date() JavaScript object. In this case the
comment contains the text in Korean "그리니치 표준시" (Greenwich Mean Time), which
indicates that the page was saved on the device with Korean locale.

Analysis of BTC transactions
The four cryptocurrency addresses extracted from the Lazarus BTC Changer samples used
by the attackers to receive stolen funds are:
0x460ab1c34e4388704c5e56e18D904Ed117D077CC

1MQC6C4FVX8RhmWESWsazEb5dyDBhxH9he
1DjyE7WUCz9DLabw5EWAuJVpUzXfN4evta

Group-IB analyzed the transactions associated with the BTC addresses controlled by
Lazarus and discovered that the adversaries most likely used CoinPayments.net. An
analysis of money transfers from the attackers' BTC addresses, extracted from the Lazarus
BTC Changer samples, to the address 35dnPpcXMGEoWE1gerDoC5xS92SYCQ61y6
revealed three transactions to BTC wallets allegedly owned by CoinPayments.net.
CoinPayments.net is a payment gateway that allows users to conduct transactions involving
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and other cryptocurrencies. As such, Lazarus may have used it
to facilitate cryptocurrency exchanges and transfers to external cryptocurrency addresses.
The website's KYC (Know Your Customer) policy could theoretically help identify individuals
behind these attacks.
ANALYSIS OF WALLETS
At the time of withdrawing cryptocurrency from the extracted BTC addresses, the attackers
transferred 0.89993859 BTC ($8,446,55 at the moment of the transaction and $52,611 as of
April 9, 2021). The two main BTC addresses
(1Gf8U7UQEJvMXW5k3jtgFATWUmQXVyHkJt and
1MQC6C4FVX8RhmWESWsazEb5dyDBhxH9he) used to steal funds received 43
transactions while the Lazarus BTC Changer campaign was active. The address
1DjyE7WUCz9DLabw5EWAuJVpUzXfN4evta was not active during the Lazarus BTC
Changer campaign because there were only one incoming and one outgoing transactions
associated with this address on January 7, 2020, two months before the Lazarus BTC
Changer campaign began. The ETH address received 29 incoming transactions, with a total
profit of 4.384719 ETH, ($9,047 as of April 9, 2021). This ETH address had been active
since July 11, 2019, however, and could have been used during other operations conducted
by the hackers. It is therefore impossible to determine the transactions which resulted from
the Lazarus BTC Changer campaign.
ANALYSIS OF OUTGOING BTC TRANSACTIONS
We tracked all outgoing transactions from the BTC addresses used by the attackers and
extracted from Lazarus BTC Changer samples. We found that all stolen funds were
transferred to a single address (35dnPpcXMGEoWE1gerDoC5xS92SYCQ61y6) as a result
of transaction a929c7
(https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/a929c7d3b7ae58eb5b833460017016267f7ac66cbd16ad0
b4c4d4c9b3f50406a). From this point onward, we used a short form of transaction IDs
instead of full IDs because of the length. Let's take a look at how all funds were transferred
before this transaction.

transaction a929c7
The address 1DjyE7WUCz9DLabw5EWAuJVpUzXfN4evta was used in two Lazarus BTC
Changer samples, but in this case the attackers were not successful: while samples with this
BTC address were detected in late March 2020, all the funds from this address were
transferred on January 7, 2020, which means that either the attackers did not receive any
money using samples involving this address, or the funds from this address were transferred
after the previous attacks. However, in January 2020 all the funds from this address were
transferred during transaction d64045
(https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/d64045015d066aaa0187e822eebbe25437785d5c56be1a
3fdcf3b77e99d324a7) to addresses 3Gud3MyyNyJvUEfaqvF3dYnYUGvxYGhvzb (which,
according to multiple wallet explorers, helps attribute wallets and transactions to particular
crypto services; this address is part of CoinPayments.net) and
15ddzs7zA59cNt3m2YsErRzVamueWTTkTZ, which was one of the source addresses in
transaction a929c7.
The address 1MQC6C4FVX8RhmWESWsazEb5dyDBhxH9he was found in four samples
used in the Lazarus BTC Changer campaign, including three samples which used fake
iframe payment forms. On April 5, 2020 the funds from this address were transferred to two
addresses as part of transaction 5b3b34
(https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/5b3b34e8fdb642b028361799df5ac3955f38653f746f98c67
183b2c62dbfb9ef): 3JnxmN6aCwhPc1cWd17ka6n7KFNbiYYRiz (which, according to
multiple wallet explorers, is part of CoinPayments.net) and large part of the funds was sent
to 1MrYhKvRiScuFPRb9ybuJzrrGX8BzR9u9r. Five days later on April 10, 2020 the funds
from 1MrYhKvRiScuFPRb9ybuJzrrGX8BzR9u9r were sent again as part of transaction

(https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/a305aee9b7916ae34cefe9d3b2665271e027af52fdf57d6e
4d3e02658760e456) to one of supposed CoinPayments.net addresses
(3A6BbxFAYGj4zgcbBUatLeVxvqSDV4nQfV) and a large part of the funds was sent to
1HDMJ42anvW97ib2awZkzSQsCjR7uxLD79, which was one of source addresses during the
main withdrawal of the stolen funds.
The address 1Gf8U7UQEJvMXW5k3jtgFATWUmQXVyHkJt used in one of the malware
samples was the most closely connected with the main withdrawal in transaction a929c7:
this address was one of the source addresses for this transaction.
Besides these three transfers from the addresses used by the attackers, there was a fourth
BTC address, which was the source in transaction a929c7
1KYjujKXcXw9mPrCr5HadY2DWCmo6aMrY9. However, we did not identify any malware
samples or other malicious activity associated with this address and other related addresses.
During the investigation, we identified three transactions as part of which a small part of the
funds was transferred to BTC addresses presumably owned by CoinPayments.net
according to multiple public wallet explorers. Based on this pattern, we can suppose that
attackers possibly use CoinPayments.net as a payment gateway and a small part of funds in
each of these transactions is the website's commission for payment.
During transaction a929c7, the funds were sent to the address
35dnPpcXMGEoWE1gerDoC5xS92SYCQ61y6 on May 17, 2020 at 00:03. Thirty-four
minutes later, the funds from this address were transferred to two BTC addresses as part of
transaction 8ad539
(https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/8ad539d33b3a9bcbc777ff252eb125c389d761c491750b4
2ef2d67d90047337d): the larger part was sent to
bc1qhs5extg53a44wcj9kfuvjvnqnv3dhpsadacttd and the other part to
bc1qkjx7gm7enumq7ektxyk54l7zww45fxsk25eggw. From the
addressbc1qhs5extg53a44wcj9kfuvjvnqnv3dhpsadacttd, the funds were sent to other
two addresses as part of transaction 6acd59
(https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/6acd5930f026c8163c1a742b7229acbceff7f9d317b9328f5
736476e5f6b5692): 0.45641878 BTC to 38r5HQigv4Yh5ETwhYV8HwZwBbvThwSmfH and
0.38125138 BTC to 1FWhm95L6Nh2eqKKS5uKsXeAFeYB4yHegm.
Further investigation didn't provide any useful connections between the BTC addresses and
public cryptocurrency services, so it is unclear where the funds were subsequently
transferred.

Conclusion
Group-IB researchers identified a previously undocumented campaign: Lazarus BTC
Changer, attributed to the North Korean hacker group called Lazarus. The campaign marks
the first time that Lazarus used malicious JS-sniffers to steal cryptocurrency. As part of the
campaign, Lazarus used the same infrastructure as in the clientToken= campaign (described
by Sansec researchers) and a modified version of the clientToken= JavaScript sniffer.
Combined with the gang's track record of going after crypto, the campaign makes it possible
to attribute the attacks to Lazarus with a high level of confidence.
Group-IB Threat Intelligence team identified a supposed payment gateway that was used in
several transactions involving the stolen funds. The website's KYC policies can theoretically
help identify individuals behind the Lazarus BTC Changer campaign.
Group-IB researchers believe that after the gang successfully tested new tools on small ecommerce stores, it will be able to switch to more prominent targets for bigger gains.
Recommendations
● To improve your visibility into the operations of threat actors carrying out JS sniffer attacks,
stay up-to-date with their latest TTPs, and receive unique data about adversary activity for
threat hunting you may use Group-IB Threat Intelligence & Attribution.
● Use complex and unique passwords to access the website's admin panel and any services
used for administration, for example phpMyAdmin, Adminer. If possible, set up two-factor
authentication.

10/12

● Install all necessary updates for the software used, including CMS of websites. Do not use
outdated or unsupported versions of the CMS. This will help to reduce the risk of servers
being compromised and make it more difficult for an attacker to download the web shell and
install malicious code.
● Regularly check the store for malware and conduct regular security audits of your website.
For example, for websites based on CMS Magento, you can use Magento Security Scan
Tool.
● Conduct complex security assessment of your website to discover all possible
vulnerabilities, get information about existing exploits, and receive in-depth
recommendations to eliminate them.
● Use the appropriate systems to log all changes that occur on the website, as well as to log
access to the website's control panel and database and track file change dates. This will help
you to detect website files infected with malicious code, as well as track unauthorized access
to the website or web server.
