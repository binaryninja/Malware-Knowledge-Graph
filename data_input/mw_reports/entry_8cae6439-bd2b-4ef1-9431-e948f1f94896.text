Why Publishing? Isn't it dangerous?
Some people in the community were raising the issue that publishing the samples and decompiled
sources might be dangerous. I agreed until these were not public. I have found the included files in at
least two publicly available sources, that means anyone can download it if know where to search. What
is more, I believe that organizations/people who could be able to reuse it and have the capability to
deploy it in a real attack have already accessed it long time ago. This repository makes it more
accessible for community and academia who might work on improving defense solutions and saves
some time on looking for decompilers.
