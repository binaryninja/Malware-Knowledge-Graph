Emotet Returns to Prey on
Banking Information

On August 2017, AhnLab confirmed, via AhnLab Smart Defense (ASD), its cloud-based malware
analysis system, that the malware Emotet is once again being distributed through spam botnet.
First spotted in 2014, Emotet is a trojan that hijacks financial information.

The newly-resurfaced Emotet features modular functions for extracting the victim’s financial
transaction information, downloading the relevant module from the C&C server to perform
its activities.

This report examines the distribution vector and operational features of Emotet, including a
detailed analysis of the malware’s primary attack patterns.

Distribution and operation of Emotet
Analysis by AhnLab revealed that Emotet strain propagated last quarter was carried via spam
botnet as email attachments.

The overall attack pattern of Emotet is as shown in Figure 1-1.

ASEC REPORT Vol.88 | Security Trend

① User downloads and runs Emotet via spammed email attachment
② Emotet is added to the autorun registry
③ System OS information, list of running processes, the malware’s PE
CRC, computer user name and volume serial number are encrypted
and sent to the C&C
④ Additional modules are downloaded from the C&C server to perform
additional malicious activities
⑤ Downloaded modules are run

Figure 1-1 | Attack pattern of Emotet

The Word document files included in the spammed email spread via botnet contains a
malicious macro as shown in Figure 1-2.

Figure 1-2 | Malicious macro contained in the Word file attachment of the spammed email

The document contains instructions such as “Macros have been disabled – Enable Content” to
trick the user into running the macro. Once the user enables the macro function, an obfuscated
powershell command as shown in Figure 1-3 is executed, which downloads a malicious file,
Emotet loader, from an external URL and runs it.

Key activities
Once the Emotet loader is executed, the malware first registers itself as a service in Windows.
① Registered as service to enable repeat execution of the
Emotet loader
② Computer name, OS information, list of running processes acquired
③ Hijackes information using Crypto API
④ Encrypts data communicated with C&C server

User information is extracted next, and
the malware communicates with the C&C
server to download the modules required

⑤ Data received from C&C server decrypted, and modules executed

for additional activities. Table 1-1 lists the key

Table 1-1 | Malicious activities carried out by the Emotet loader

activities performed by the Emotet loader.

1. Service registry
The Emotet loader calls the OpenSCManagerW API to check administrative privileges for
installing and enumerating services. If the loader successfully obtains admin privilege, a routine
for registering the Emotet loader as a service is executed, and a copy is dropped into the path
%Windir%\System32.

Figure 1-4 | Calling OpenSCManagerW to check admin rights

The 0x40884A code as shown in Figure 1-4 reveals that the value assigned to DS:[40B2A4] is
determined by the result of the OpenSCManagerW API call. The value per byte in the DS:[40B2A4]
of the 0x4088EC code in Figure 1-5 defines the destination of the self-duplicate of Emotet loader.

Figure 1-6 | Configuring the service description

After service creation, the Emotet loader calls the ChangeServiceConfig2W API as shown in
Figure 1-6 to change the service description. The API copies a random description from an

ASEC REPORT Vol.88 | Security Trend

existing service to change the description of the new service.

2. User data collection
After completing the service creation process, the Emotet loader begins gathering user
information. The loader extracts system OS version, computer name, volume serial number, list
of processes, and running PE CRC information.
Then the hijacked information is transmitted
to the C&C server after the encryption. The
extraction of user information such as OS data
and PE CRC32 were observed as shown in
Figure 1-7 | Hijacked user and system information

Figure 1-7.

3. Data encryption via Crypt API
Emotet loader encrypts the collected user information, using either a custom encryption or
the Crypt API. In case of the latter, the file contains the RSA public key as shown in Figure 1-8,
which is used to encrypt the random AES-128 symmetric key called by the CryptGenKey API.

Figure 1-8 | Codes for extracting the RSA public key and generating the AES-128 random key

ASEC REPORT Vol.88 | Security Trend

As shown in Figure 1-9, Emotet loader file contains the RSA public key stored by the attacker;
the key decoded by the CryptDecodeObjectEx API is shown in Figure 1-10.

Figure 1-9 | RSA public key contained in the file

Figure 1-10 | The key decoded by RSA public key

Finally, the Emotet loader uses the CryptEncrypt API for AES-128 CBC mode encryption and
generates hash values for the data. The AES-128 key value used in the encryption is extracted
by the CryptExportKey API and copied to memory.

Figure 1-11 | Data encryption process

ASEC REPORT Vol.88 | Security Trend

4. Encrypted data sent to the C&C server
When the data encryption process is fully
complete, the Emotet loader uses POST to
transfer the encrypted data to the C&C server,
as shown in Figure 1-12.

Figure 1-12 | POST data transfer

A notable feature is that the C&C server re-

turns a 404 error value to the client in response as shown in Figure 1-13, which in fact contains
additional encrypted malicious modules.

Figure 1-13 | POST transfer and 404 error

While the C&C server was blocked during the time of this investigation preventing a verification
of the nature of this malicious module, the actual size of the response value sent to the client
under normal circumstances is known to exceed 0x1c000.

5. Encrypted data received from C&C server decoded and executed
While acquiring the malicious modules from the blocked C&C server proved to be unavailable,
static analysis of the loader revealed the nature of the malicious activities performed by the
additional modules. As shown in Figure 1-14, the Emotet loader performs data decoding after
receiving a response value from the C&C server and executes a file presumed to be the newlydownloaded module.

ASEC REPORT Vol.88 | Security Trend

Figure 1-14 | Code for creating and executing the additional module files

Finally, with the execution of the additional modules on the infected system, a module is
injected into the current Web browser and activated to hijack user information.

The list of additional malicious modules
downloaded from the C&C server are shown
in Table 1-4.

- Network distribution module
- Spammed email module
- Browser-injected financial data hijack module

•Q3 2017 Ransomware Trends

Threat Review

Q3 2017
Ransomware Trends

The relentless assault by ransomware continued during the third quarter of this year. A large
number of Locky variants appeared, in addition to an increasing variety of ransomware
including RaaS (Ransomware as a Service). This report presents the ransomware trends of the
third quarter 2017.

1. Locky Variants
Another hail of Locky variants dropped during the third quarter 2017. Although these variants
used different types of email attachment or encrypted file extensions, the ransom note
generated after the encryption process revealed their family ties to Locky.

Lukitus
Sporting the extension .lukitus for its encrypted files, Lukitus is a strain of Locky that uses
a Windows Script Host error message to lure users. Propagated via spammed emails, this
ransomware uses enticing titles such as “Voice message attached” or “Pictures” to invite clicking.
The actual payload, however, is a compressed file written in JavaScript (JS) which downloads
and runs the ransomware.

ASEC REPORT Vol.88 | Security Trend

13

Figure 2-1 | Emails serving as the vector for Lukitus

By clicking the attachment, the JS file executes Windows Script Host. However, an error
message is displayed on the screen as shown
in Figure 2-2 to confuse the user into thinking
Figure 2-2 | Fake error message

that an error has occurred.

While the user may think an error has occurred due to the popup message in Figure 2-2,
wscript.exe is executed in background as seen in Figure 2-3.

Figure 2-3 | wscript.exe executed

When executed, Lukitus shows a ransom
note as shown in Figure 2-4, identical to that
of existing Locky ransomware.

Ykcol
Yet another Locky variant named Ykcol sur-

faced in mid-September. This ransomware assigns the extension .ykcol to encrypted files,
which is Locky spelled backwards. The ransomware is distributed by spammed emails bearing
the subject “Status of Invoice”.

Similar to Locky attaching a .7zip compressed file in emails, this variant also uses an
attachment compressed as .7zip or .7z to
evade mailing filters.

Uncompressing the file contained in the email
will generate a VBS (Visual Basic Script) file.
Figure 2-5 | Spammed email containing a .7z file

Running the VBS file will initiate downloading

of the actual ransomware file from a URL hardcoded in the file. The downloaded ransomware
encrypts the files in the user’s PC and changes their extensions to .ykcol as shown in Figure 2-6.

Figure 2-6 | Files given .ykcol extensions after encryption

Like Lukitus, Ykcol also displays the identical ransom note as Locky.

ASEC REPORT Vol.88 | Security Trend

Figure 2-7 | Ykcol’s ransom note, also identical to Locky’s

2. CryptoMix variants
CryptoMix is another ransomware with a stable of variants as extensive as Locky. CryptoMix
was discovered in May of 2016 and became famous for its extensive list of variants.
CryptoShield 1.0 and 2.0, Revenge, Mole and Wallet are all classified as CryptoMix variants, and
additional strains were discovered in July.

Azer
Spotted on July 5, Azer was written in Visual C++. Once the user’s system is infected, the
ransomware duplicates itself to the Application Data folder and runs.

Azer modifies the registry to include itself in the system’s startup programs, to ensure that
the encryption process is not interrupted if the PC is shut off or rebooted.

Azer adds the extension .azer to encrypted files as shown in Figure 2-8.

ASEC REPORT Vol.88 | Security Trend

16

Figure 2-8 | Files added with the .Azer extension

The .txt ransom note created in the folder containing the encrypted files includes the
infected PC’s unique ID and two email addresses for sending the request to release the files
as shown in Figure 2-9. One is the address used in the file name, while the other presumably
is intended as a refer to the current U.S. president.

Figure 2-9 | Azer’s ransom note and instructions for recovery

Exte
Discovered on July 14, Exte is another CryptoMix variant written in Visual C++, and is thus
almost identical with the aforementioned Azer in duplicating itself and modifying the registry.

Exte adds the extension .EXTE to encrypted files.

ASEC REPORT Vol.88 | Security Trend

17

Figure 2-10 | Files with the new .Exte extensions

Unlike Azer, the ransom note created by Exte in the encrypted file folder provides three email
addresses from different domains including “exte” in the name. Furthermore, unlike Azer that
beings the infected PC’s unique ID with “You ID”, Exte uses the heading “Decrypt-ID”.

Figure 2-11 | Exte’s ransom note with instructions for file recovery

3. Ransomware-as-a-Service (Raas)
Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) or ransomware developed and managed by third
parties for a price, began to appear in 2016.
The ransomware Shifr, discovered in the
third quarter of this year, is one of these
RaaS. The attackers require only a simple
set of information such as bitcoin address,

ASEC REPORT Vol.88 | Security Trend

Figure 2-12 | Potential attackers need only to fill out three fields to
request a ransomware

18

the ransom amount and a captcha check; while other fabricators ask for a bitcoin address,
email, and desired amount of ransom to be demanded and the file extension to be used. This
enables anyone to handily order up Shifr ransomware.

The provider for the Shifr service demands a 10% cut of the profits, a relative bargain for the
attacker compared to the average rate of half the profits by other providers. These features
may lead more attackers to turn to Shifr.

Figure 2-13 | Shifr’s RaaS

Files encrypted by Shifr are given the extension .shifr, as shown in Figure 2-14.

Figure 2-14 | Files encrypted by .shifr

Shifr encrypts document files and pictures, commonly found in all systems, but leaves
compressed files untouched.

ASEC REPORT Vol.88 | Security Trend

19

Once the encryption of the files in a system
infected by Shifr is completed, a ransom note
file is created on the desktop, as shown in
Figure 2-15. This is a unique feature of Shifr,
as most ransomware create a ransom note in
Figure 2-15 | Ransom note dropped on the desktop

each folder containing encrypted files.

The ransom note created by Shifr and placed on the desktop only contains a simple message
“Your files have been encrypted” as shown in Figure 2-16, and a link for instructions on how
to decrypt the files. The note is very simple, compared with those of other ransomware that
include detailed instructions on ransom payment and file recovery.

4. Ransomware flavored with social engineering
Shade, a ransomware that disguises itself as
a scanned document sent by an all-in-one
printer, surfaced in late July. This ransomware
appears to be designed to target users in
corporate environments that often encounter

ASEC REPORT Vol.88 | Security Trend

Figure 2-17 | Shade ransomware disguised as an emailed scanned
document

20

scanned documents as part of their daily routines. The ransomware uses a password-protected
document file in an advanced attack pattern that sets itself apart from the competition.

As shown in Figure 2-17, Shade disguises itself as an email sent by a printer after scanning
a file. The ransomware uses an official-looking “noreply” email address to try to assuage the
recipient’s suspicions.

Opening the Word document file contained in the email produces a popup message asking for
the file’s password.

Most Word files distributed via spammed email messages do not include passwords. The
example above, however, uses a password to lock the document and includes the password in
the email message to try to avoid detection.

Entering the password contained in the email
body runs the macro embedded in the Word
file. The macro connects to a particular URL to
Figure 2-18 | Downloaded malware

download and run the malware.

Shade creates a batch file when run, which is used to delete the volume shadow copy containing
the Windows system restore point, the remote desktop access history and Windows event records.
The ransomware then proceeds with the encryption and alters the file extensions. Most files are
targeted for attack, from DOC, PPT, XLS, TXT and other documents to EXE and ZIP files. Once the
encryption is complete, the ransomware deletes itself to erase its footprints.

ASEC REPORT Vol.88 | Security Trend

21

It has become widely known that ransomware
is distributed as attachments in spammed
emails. However, using a password-locked
file may buy time for the malicious code
to exploit weaknesses. Shade appears to
be the latest in such attempts to employ
increasingly-advanced attack patterns.
