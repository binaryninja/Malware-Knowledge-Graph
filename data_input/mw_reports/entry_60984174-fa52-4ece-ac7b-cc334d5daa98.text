LockBit ransomware is the latest threat posing an increased risk for organizations. The
ransomware gang has been making headlines recently. LockBit has also reportedly
compromised Accenture.
The group reportedly revealed the attack on their site on the DarkWeb, noting: “These
people are beyond privacy and security. I really hope that their services are better than what
I saw as an insider. If you are interested in buying some databases, reach us.”

What Is LockBit?
LockBit is a cybercriminal gang that operates using a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS)
model—similar to DarkSide and REvil. LockBit offers its ransomware platform for other
entities or individuals to use based on an affiliate model. Any ransom payments received
from using LockBit are divided between the customer directing the attack and the LockBit
gang.
LockBit is believed to be related to the LockerGoga and MegaCortex malware families. It
shares common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) with these malicious attacks—
particularly the ability to propagate automatically to new targets, being used in targeted

attacks rather than just spamming or attacking organizations indiscriminately, and the
underlying tools it relies on, such as Windows PowerShell and Server Message Block (SMB).

Once a single host is compromised, LockBit can scan the network to locate and infect other
accessible devices. It uses tools and protocols that are native to Windows systems—making
it more difficult for endpoint security tools to detect or identify the activity as malicious.
The LockBit ransomware continues to adapt and evolve. More recent variants have adopted
the double extortion model—locating and exfiltrating valuable data before encrypting
systems. The stolen data provides additional incentive for victims to pay the ransom. Even if
they can restore data from backups, refusing to pay the ransom may result in sensitive data
being published publicly or sold to competitors.

Rising Threat
The LockBit gang has been making headlines recently. In the wake of DarkSide and REvil
both shutting down operations, it seems like LockBit may be working to fill the void.
Lawrence Abrams recently reported that the LockBit ransomware gang is actively recruiting
insiders to help them breach and encrypt networks. According to Abrams, this may be a shift
from the standard ransomware-as-a-service model to cut out the middleman and keep more
of the ransom profit for themselves.

compromise systems—promising payouts of millions of dollars.

Protecting against LockBit Ransomware
3/6

There is no good option for an organization once a ransomware attack has compromised
systems and encrypted data. That is especially true in the case of a double extortion attack.
Refusing to pay the ransom means going through a painful process of restoring data from
backups and trying to regain control and functionality of your systems while also accepting
that your data will likely be exposed.
Paying the ransom may allow the victim to be operational quicker and prevent having data
published or sold, but research shows that 80% of companies that pay a ransom end up
getting attacked again.
It is important to have effective protection in place to prevent the ransomware attack from
getting that far in the first place. Organizations need to have an operation-centric view of the
attack. The ability to view the entire malicious operation—or MalOp—and recognize
indicators of behavior enables Cybereason to detect and block ransomware attacks and
protect against threats like LockBit.

Defending Against Ransomware Attacks
The only way forward for organizations is to prevent an infection from occurring in the first
place. To do that, they need to invest in an anti-ransomware solution that doesn’t rely on
Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), as not every ransomware attack chain is known to the
security community. They need a multi-layered platform that uses Indicators of Behavior
(IOBs) so that security teams can detect and shut down a ransomware attack chain
regardless of whether anyone’s seen it before.
The Cybereason Operation-Centric approach means no data filtering and the ability to detect
attacks earlier based on rare or advantageous chains of (otherwise normal) behaviors.
Cybereason is undefeated in the battle against ransomware thanks to our multi-layered
prevention, detection and response, which includes:

Anti ransomware prevention and deception: Cybereason uses a combination
of behavioral detections and proprietary deception techniques surface the most
complex ransomware threats and end the attack before any critical data can be
encrypted.
Intelligence-Based Antivirus: Cybereason blocks known ransomware variants
leveraging an ever-growing pool of threat intelligence based on previously
detected attacks.
NGAV: Cybereason NGAV is powered by machine learning and recognizes
malicious components in code to block unknown ransomware variants prior to
execution.
Fileless Ransomware Protection: Cybereason disrupts attacks utilizing fileless
and MBR-based ransomware that traditional antivirus tools miss.
Endpoint Controls: Cybereason hardens endpoints against attacks by
managing security policies, maintaining device controls, implementing personal
firewalls and enforcing whole-disk encryption across a range of device types,
both fixed and mobile.
Behavioral Document Protection: Cybereason detects and blocks ransomware
hidden in the most common business document formats, including those that
leverage malicious macros and other stealthy attack vectors.

Cybereason is dedicated to teaming with defenders to end cyber attacks from endpoints to
the enterprise to everywhere - including modern ransomware. Learn more about
