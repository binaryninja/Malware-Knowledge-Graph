Target Attacks against Tibetan and Hong Kong
Groups Exploiting CVE-2014-4114

Authors: Katie Kleemola, Masashi Crete-Nishihata, and John Scott-Railton

INTRODUCTION
This post analyzes targeted malware attacks against groups in the Tibetan diaspora and pro-democracy groups
in Hong Kong. All of these attacks leveraged CVE-2014-4114 and were delivered via malicious Microsoft
PowerPoint Slideshow files (*.pps). These attacks are highly targeted, appear to re-purpose legitimate content
in decoy documents, and had very low antivirus (AV) detection rates at the time they were deployed.
The attacks against Tibetan groups shows a change in tactics from previous campaigns. Over the past four
years the majority of attacks we have seen against Tibetan groups use CVE-2010-3333 or CVE-2012-0158.
The use of CVE-2014-4114 marks the first time we have observed a change from this pattern in the last two
years.
One attack sent to Tibetan groups used a link to a file on Google Drive to deliver the malware. Groups in the
Tibetan community have promoted awareness campaigns around e-mail attachments, which have been the
most common attack vector for the community. This campaign, “Detach from Attachments,” urges users to
avoid sending or opening email attachments, and to use cloud-based storage to send files like Google Drive as
an alternative. The use of Google Drive to send malware may be evidence of attackers adapting to the
behavioral countermeasures promoted by the campaign.
In addition to the use of the same CVE, some of the attacks targeting Tibetan rights groups and Hong Kong
groups have overlap in malware family (PlugX) and Command and Control (C2) domains. The similarities
between these attacks suggests that either they are being conducted by the same threat actor or threat actors
targeting these groups are sharing tactics, tools, and procedures (TTPs).

Targeting and Social Engineering
We observed a total of five malware campaigns that used CVE-2014-4114 and a range of social engineering
tactics to persuade recipients to either open an attachment, or visit a URL and download a malicious file.
In all of these attacks, if a recipient double clicks on the .pps file, they are shown decoy content. Examination
1

June 2015

of the exif metadata of the files indicates that the attackers are likely repurposing material from legitimate
presentations.
PPT files (the more commonly used PowerPoint file extension) are automatically opened in edit mode,
whereas .pps files are automatically opened in slideshow mode. For the CVE-2014-4114 exploit to work, the
Powerpoint Slideshow needs to be played. Sending .pps files that automatically run a PowerPoint Slideshow is
likely an attempt by the attackers to increase the infection rate.

TIBETAN ATTACKS
Over April and May 2015 we observed 3 attack campaigns targeting a number of Tibetan organizations. The
sophistication of the social engineering varied between attacks, but all attacks appeared to use re-purposed
legitimate content.

Tibet Attack 1: April 2015
The first attack we observed was sent to multiple Tibetan groups over the course of April 2015. The email text
is taken from a website related to an advocacy campaign and report by the International Tibet Network (ITN),
a prominent Tibetan rights group. The email signature includes the real office address of ITN. However, the
sender’s email address (tibet_net@yahoo.com.hk) is not a legitimate address related to the group. Attached to
the email was a .pps file that repurposes slides from a presentation related to the same report and advocacy
campaign referenced in the email message.

Tibet Attack 2: April 28, 2015
The second attack was sent out on April 28 2015 to multiple Tibetan organizations. The email message
references a recent visit between Archbishop Desmond Tutu and His Holiness the Dalai Lama (HHDL). The
.pps attachment also referenced the event and appears to be repurposed from legitimate material.

Tibet Attack 3: May 6 2015
The third attack was sent to Tibetan groups on May 6 2015 and contained a simpler message than previous
attacks that urges the recipient to download a file from Google Drive, appears to repurpose legitimate content.
Dear Sir/Madam,
I have shared the Biography of H.H. THE 14TH DALAI LAMA via Google Drive.
Kindly download it.
PowerPoint Slideshow files do not display properly on Google Drive, and therefore a recipient may be
tempted to download and open the file on their computer. The use of Google Docs is potentially evidence of
attackers changing tactics in reaction to the Detach from Attachments campaign.

HONG KONG ATTACK CAMPAIGNS
We analyzed two attacks sent over the course of March 2015 that targeted individuals associated with human
rights groups and pro-democratic political parties in Hong Kong.

Hong Kong Attack 1: March 6, 2015
The first attack was sent on March 6 2015. The email signature was made to appear to come from an assistant
of Dr. Margaret Ng who is a Barrister and a former member of the Legislative Council in Hong Kong. The
.pps attachment used a decoy document that appears to repurpose slides from an actual presentation Dr. Ng
gave to Columbia Law School in February 2015.

Hong Kong Attack 2: March 31, 2015

The second attack was sent on March 31 2015, and contained a message related to
the Occupy Central protests. The .pps file attachment was also related to Occupy
Central and appears to repurpose legitimate content.
INFECTION
Despite the variety of targets and delivery approaches, the malware shares a common infection process. When
the PowerPoint Slideshow is played, the malware leverages CVE-2014-4114, a vulnerability in the OLE
Package Manager to infect the target machine. Computers using Windows Vista and above are susceptible to
this attack. In addition to the decoy document, the malicious slideshow contains two embedded OLE objects:
a .inf file and a malicious executable with a .gif extension that are dropped to the temp folder.

5

June 2015

The .inf file is used to copy the executable and then run it.

6

June 2015

The CVE-2014-4114 vulnerability has been described by Rapid7 and was previously linked to the
“Sandworm” Russian threat actor. In these previously reported attacks, the .inf and .gif files are copied from a
remote smb share to the victim’s computer. In the attacks we describe here the payload is embedded in the
OLE objects, similar to cases described by TrendMicro.
Since CVE-2014-4114 is a vulnerability in the OLE package manager it makes it possible for attackers to
create a PowerPoint presentation in which the OLE package manager loads a fake .gif file (that is actually a
malicious executable), and then a malicious .inf file that runs the executable.
If a user double clicks on the malicious attachment, the decoy file opens without crashing the program or
producing any other obvious signs that something is wrong with the file. This behaviour contrasts with how
other common CVEs used to target groups in the Tibetan community (e.g, CVE-2012-0158, CVE-2010-3333)
behave, which typically cause the vulnerable program to crash before opening a decoy document.
The exploit used in these attacks does not contain shell code, which makes it harder for AV heuristics to detect

it. Of the samples we analyzed that have been uploaded to VirusTotal, two currently have 0 detections out of
57 AV engines (see Table 1).

PLUGX ATTACKS

Three of the sampled we analyzed used the PlugX malware family. PlugX is a
well-known malware family that researchers have observed being used in targeted
attacks against NGOs, government institutions, and private companies. A Trend
Micro report on PlugX, describes a long-standing campaign that previously used
Poison Ivy, another malware family. Jaime Blasco at AlienVault claims to have
tracked down the author of PlugX, who is allegedly based at a Chinese security
company.
In these three samples, the embedded executable in OLE is a self extracting RAR
containing the three components of PlugX: a signed legitimate executable, a
malicious DLL, and a binary file containing the main payload.
Using a technique known as DLL sideloading, the legitimate executable runs the
malicious DLL. This malicious code then decrypts and decompresses the binary
8

file in memory which contains the main functionality. Since the malicious code is
being run by a signed, legitimate executable, and the payload never exists
unencrypted on disk, it is more difficult for AV to detect PlugX.
For two of the three Plug X samples the the malware leverages expired certificates
from legitimate vendors: one executable signed by Microsoft and one by F-Secure.

Connections To Other Malware Families And Campaigns

While three attacks used PlugX malware, two other attacks did not. One of these
attacks targeted Tibetan groups, the second targeted Hong Kong-based groups.
The non-PlugX attack against Tibetan groups communicates with
free1999.jkub.com, a C2 that we have previously observed in multiple campaigns
using the Surtr malware family and targeting Tibetan groups. The Valkyrie-X
Security Research Group has also observed this C2 used in attacks against Hong
Kong-based groups.
The non-PlugX attack against Hong Kong-based groups used a malware family
that Symantec calls Wofeksad and connects to the C2 eset-windows.findhere.org.
We have observed the Wofeskad malware family in another attack against a large
International NGO that works on multiple countries and issues. However, that
attack used CVE-2012-0158 and communicated with a different C2.
Details of the samples analyzed in this report are outlined in Table 2.

Conclusion
The re-purposed content, low AV detection rate, and the lack of any obvious signs to a user that the files are
malicious (such as a program crash) make these attacks concerning. In the case of the Tibetan attacks, the use
of CVE-2014-4114 shows a shift in tactics and a possible move away from CVE-2012-0158, which is the
most commonly used CVE we have seen in attacks against the community. In addition, the use of Google
Drive further suggests a potential change in tactics, possibly in response to behavioral countermeasures
developed by Tibetan civil society.

The overlap in attacks against Tibet and Hong Kong groups also raises questions for future work. Are the
attacks being conducted by the same threat actor, or is there sharing of TTPs between actors targeting these
groups? Further analysis of attacks against these communities is needed to probe these questions.
