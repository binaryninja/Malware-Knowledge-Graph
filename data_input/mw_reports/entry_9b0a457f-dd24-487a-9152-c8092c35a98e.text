Executive summary
AT&T Alien Labs™ has discovered a new campaign by threat group TeamTNT that is targeting multiple
operating systems and applications. The campaign uses multiple shell/batch scripts, new open source tools,
a cryptocurrency miner, the TeamTNT IRC bot, and more.
Alien Labs research indicates the command and control (C&C) server used in this newly discovered
campaign contains infection statistics that suggest TeamTNT has been running this campaign since July 25,
2021, and that it is responsible for thousands of infections globally.

Key takeaways:
TeamTNT is using new, open source tools to steal usernames and passwords from infected machines.
The group is targeting various operating systems including: Windows, different Linux distributions
including Alpine (used for containers), AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes.
The campaign has been active for approximately one month and is responsible for thousands of
infections globally.
As of August 30, 2021, many malware samples still have zero antivirus (AV) detections and others
have low detection rates.

Background
1/14

TeamTNT has been one of the most active threat groups since mid 2020. Their activity typically uses open
source tools for malicious activity. A partial list of imported tools contains:
Masscan and port scanner to search for new infection candidates
libprocesshider for executing their bot directly from memory
7z to decompress downloaded files
b374k shell which is a php web administrator that can be used to control infected systems
Lazagne, an open-source tool for multiple web operating systems, which is used to collect stored
credentials from numerous applications
Several recent publications, such the one by TrendMicro, have described in detail TeamTNT campaigns,
including the tools and techniques they use. One of the most recent findings (June 4, 2021) came from Palo
Alto researchers who discovered the TeamTNT Chimaera repository. In July 2021, TeamTNT began running
the Chimaera campaign using new tools, and they began publishing infection statistics publicly on their
website for the first time (Figures 1, 2).
As of the publishing of this report, many of the samples analyzed by Alien Labs have zero or low detection
on VirusTotal. However, defenders can be proactive in hardening their systems. For example, due to the
recent, high profile attacks on Kubernetes — including those executed by TeamTNT — the National
Security Agency (NSA) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
published “Kubernetes Hardening Guidance” in August of this year. Defenders should reference this guide to
understand how to better defend against attacks like those used by TeamTNT.

Analysis of components used in the “Chimaera” campaign
New credentials stealer (“Lazagne” component)
The malicious script starts its activity by modifying the bash history file. This hides any future commands
executed from users using the “history” command on Linux.
The script then installs its dependencies (‘curl’, ‘bash’, ‘wget’, ‘pip’, ‘py3-pip’, ‘python3-pip’). As seen in figure
3, supported operating systems include different Linux distributions, such as Alpine Linux which is typically
used in containers.

Figure 3. The first stage of the Lazagne component.
Once the malware is finished with its “pre-setup,” it downloads the second phase of the attack from its C&C,
which includes another bash script (‘run.sh’) along with the Lazagne project, as seen in figure 4.

5/14

Figure 4. Second stage of the Lazagne component (‘run.sh’).
Lazagne is an open-source project available for different operating systems (Windows, Linux, and MacOS).
Its developer describes the Lazagne tool as an application that can be used to retrieve multiple passwords
stored on a local machine. Due to its capabilities, the tool has been added as a post exploitation module to
the pupy project.
It supports a wide range of programs, such as browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, etc.), Sysadmin programs
(such as CoreFTP, Putty, OpenSSH, etc. ), Wifi password, mail programs, databases, etc. The full list of
supported programs can be found on the Lazagne page on Github.
In this phase two of the attack, the second malicious script executes the Lazagne tool, saves its output into
“laZagne.out.txt,” and uploads it to the C&C using the curl command. At the end of the execution, the
malware deletes any file that has been downloaded.

Windows component – Set up a cryptocurrency miner
For Windows operating systems, the attackers use a malicious script that downloads all the tools required
for unpacking and executing the Xmrig miner. This includes the 7z tool for decompressing downloaded files
and Nssm to add the miner as a service. (See figure 5.)

6/14

Figure 5. Windows module
The malware will setup the miner and then the miner will persist it in the system in two ways: 1) by adding
itself as a service if the malware gains admin privileges or 2) by adding the batch file to the startup folder.
(See figure 6.)

Kubernetes root payload component
This component is mainly responsible for installing a cryptocurrency miner on infected devices, allowing the
attacker to connect remotely to the system using SSH. (See figure 7)

7/14

Figure 7. Kubernetes root payload
The malicious script uses the following steps to achieve its goal:
Disabling or uninstalling security products on infected machines, such as Aegis Authenticator, quartz,
and Alibaba services (AliSecGuard, AliYunDun, AliNet etc.). (Figures 8, 9)
Adding the attacker’s RSA-key to the list of known SSH host (allowing the attacker to connect the
machine through SSH without the need of user/password in the system).
Installing missing required tools for crypto mining.
Modifying the host file.
Setting up the XMRig crypto miner.
Adding persistence for the XMR miner.
Removing itself.

TeamTNT IRC bot
As described previously this year by Lacework, TeamTNT includes ZiggyStartux in their IRC bot. Now, the
bot has extended its availability to “Unix Shell & Command Function” (See figure 10).

TeamTNT AWS stealer
Similar to the other TeamTNT components, the AWS stealer (see figure 11) first installs missing
dependencies. It then collects information from infected devices and stores the informaiton in a temporary
file “/var/tmp/TeamTNT_AWS_STEALER.txt”.

Figure 11. AWS stealer
This information includes:
AWS default region
AWS access key Id
AWS secret access key
AWS session token
AWS user credentials
AWS root credentials
Shared credentials file
Container credential relative URI
When finished, the malware uploads all of the stored information to its C&C using curl command, and then it
cleans up its traces.

Conclusion
AT&T Alien Labs has discovered new malicious files distributed by the threat actor TeamTNT. As researches
have observed of TeamTNT in older campaigns, they are focusing on stealing cloud systems credentials,
using infected systems for cryptocurrency mining, and abusing victim’s machines to search and spread to
other vulnerable systems. The use of open-source tools like Lazagne allows TeamTNT to stay below the
radar for a while, making it more difficult for anti-virus companies to detect.

Recommended actions
1. Keep your software with the latest security updates.
2. Keep minimal exposure to the Internet on Linux servers and IoT devices and use a properly configured
firewall.
3. Monitor network traffic, outbound port scans, and unreasonable bandwidth usage.
