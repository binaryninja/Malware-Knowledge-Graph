Abstract—Ransomware operations have evolved from relatively unsophisticated threat actors into highly coordinated cybercrime syndicates that regularly extort millions of dollars
in a single attack. Despite dominating headlines and crippling
businesses across the globe, there is relatively little in-depth
research into the modern structure and economics of ransomware
operations.
In this paper, we leverage leaked chat messages to provide
an in-depth empirical analysis of Conti, one of the largest
ransomware groups. By analyzing these chat messages, we
construct a picture of Conti’s operations as a highly-profitable
business, from profit structures to employee recruitment and
roles. We present novel methodologies to trace ransom payments,
identifying over $80 million in likely ransom payments to Conti
and its predecessor – over five times as much as in previous public
datasets. As part of our work, we will publish a dataset of 666
labeled Bitcoin addresses related to Conti and an additional 75
Bitcoin addresses of likely ransom payments. Future work can
leverage this case study to more effectively trace – and ultimately
counteract – ransomware activity.
Index Terms—Ransomware, Conti, cybercrime

I. I NTRODUCTION
Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts the files
on a victim’s computer, and charges an extortion fee for
the decryption key. Ransomware attacks have significantly
increased over the past years with the addition of more
adversarial groups, new extortion tactics, and more targeted
attacks. In 2021, ransomware payments exceeded $600 million
USD, according to cryptocurrency analysis firm Chainalysis
[1].
This has resulted in the emergence of large-scale Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) operations that have streamlined
segments of their campaigns by dividing the work across
different roles and responsibilities. This often encompasses
affiliate models, where a core team responsible for developing
malware leases it to others to deploy and infect potential
victims. However, there has been little academically peerreviewed analysis of modern ransomware operations. This lack
of insight into backend information on RaaS campaigns has
left the security industry inferring for years, on an anecdotal
basis, how these threats operate.
In this paper, we perform an analysis of leaked chat messages and cryptocurrency addresses associated with Conti.
Based on a report from Chainalysis, Conti is one of the
most prolific ransomware groups and has attacked thousands
of organizations [1]. Conti’s victims include critical infrastructure entities such as hospitals and food providers [1].

Despite setbacks to the Conti ransomware collective, including
self-proclaimed shutdowns and re-branding, they continually
ranked in the top three ransomware groups for number of
victims and volume of ransoms in 2020 and 2021 [2].
The chat data was leaked by a Ukrainian security researcher
in February 2022 in response to the Russian invasion of
Ukraine [3]. The leak included over 168,000 messages from
Conti’s internal chat logs. The chat logs contain information
pertaining to the inner workings of the group, such as discussions of malware development and victim negotiations. These
chats contain a wealth of data to aid in the understanding of
Conti’s inner operations, including associates’ Bitcoin wallet
addresses, employee recruitment processes, and delineation of
roles and responsibilities.
Our analysis drives insights that can be leveraged by law
enforcement and policymakers to aid in counteracting ransomware. For instance, just two exchanges – one unidentified
exchange and Gemini – are responsible for over 90% of
identified payments to Conti. Likewise, Conti exhibits poor
operational security, with its associates sending a large amount
of salary payments to exchanges like Gemini and Binance
that enforce Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations. These
centralized points provide opportunities to trace ransomware
actors and seize funds.
In this paper, we make the following contributions:
Economic on-chain measurement. We manually annotate
all 666 Bitcoin addresses present in the leak according to their
function (e.g. salary or reimbursement) which we will publicly
publish. After annotating, we then use on-chain transaction
data to provide an analysis of Conti’s bottom line, including
estimated gross revenue, operating cost, salary per role, cashout techniques, and relation to other cybercrime activity (like
dark web marketplaces). As part of this analysis, we develop a
methodology to identify ransom payments based on common
proceed splitting behavior, which we use to identify $83.9
million in new likely payments.
Qualitative business structure analysis. The chat logs
also contain qualitative information on different roles and
responsibilities of Conti. Along with the Bitcoin address
annotations, we identified the roles and responsibilities within
the collective. We assessed team composition from the chats,
as well as the primary users based upon interactions within
the chat logs. We also provide an analysis of their employee
recruitment process and challenges managers faced with employees that did not know the illicit nature of their employer.

II. BACKGROUND
In this section, we describe the functional roles of the
archetypal Ransomware as a Service operation. These roles
are segmented into specialized tasks that fulfill different parts
of the ransomware attack chain [4]. We explore how these roles
execute the respective parts of the ransomware campaign, from
malware delivery to cashing out [5], [6].
Ransomware operations require individuals to build, test,
maintain, and deliver the malware, as well as maintain victim
communications during the ransom. Once a victim pays a
ransom in cryptocurrency, the attacker launders the funds
through a variety of exchanges and third party services.
Since the introduction of the first public ransomware leak
site in 2019, approximately 80 ransomware groups have created public leak sites, where they threaten to post victim data
if victims fail to meets the terms of the extortion [7]. There
are ransomware groups that do not maintain leak sites, and
thus this number is not exhaustive. There is also overlap in
these operations, including code re-use, and re-branding that
typically occurs after a significant ransomware incident [8],
[9].
At a macro-level, RaaS operations are generally divided
between Ransomware Operators and Ransomware Affiliates. The operators are typically salaried workers that recruit
new members, develop the malware, advertise and sell access to their ransomware, and maintain the victim payment
portal and leak site post-compromise. Affiliates are typically
commissioned workers that license the malware for a fee
or a percentage of the ransom payment. Their role is to
target and compromise new victims, deliver and execute the
ransomware, and handle victim negotiations. Affiliates have
also been associated with lateral movement, persistence, and
data exfiltration in a victim’s network [9], [10].
Management: RaaS operations can encompass hundreds of
specialized workers. They have been likened to a gig economy for their on-demand services provided by their affiliate
structure. Additionally, many phases of the attack chain are
facilitated by human decision-making [9], [10]. The managers
are responsible for the human effort, which includes human
resources, hiring, finances, and payroll. Managers may also
have cross-departmental responsibilities, and support the other
lines of effort listed below.
Development and Infrastructure: Illicit economies are
dependent upon administrative work and maintenance to ensure uninterrupted operations through development and infrastructure [11]. System administrators and software developers
are salaried workers, essential to ensure uninterrupted RaaS
operations. This may include acquiring or developing software,
virtual machines, servers, proxies, antivirus (to test malware
against), and a variety of other tools. These roles also offer IT
support functions.
Access Operations: Access brokers may sell access to
affiliates, who use the access to escalate privileges and move
laterally within a victims network. Initial access brokers
monetize access to victim’s networks. RaaS collectives may

have their own access brokers, or they may outsource to third
parties for access-as-a-service. Initial access brokers employ a
variety of tactics, techniques, and procedures to gain access to
victims networks, including spear-phishing key members of an
organization, compromised credentials or remote desktop protocols (RDP), and exploiting vulnerabilities [12]–[14]. Access
operations may employ a variety of tools to deploy malware,
including Emotet, IcedID, Trickbot, and BazarLoader.
Negotiations: Affiliates are typically responsible for managing negotiations post-compromise through an admin panel included with the ransomware. Large corporations may employ
the use of ransomware negotiators, which deal directly with
the ransomware affiliates to transfer cryptocurrencies through
exchanges. RaaS operators manage the public leak site, where
details of the victim are included if they fail to pay within a
given time period. The operators also control the processing
of ransomware payments.
III. DATA
Our analysis in this study uses both leaked data, public
blockchain data, and an annotated set of Bitcoin addresses
from Crystal Blockchain, a commercial blockchain analysis
platform [15]. Table I provides a brief description of these
data sources. When using leaked data, there can arise both
ethical and validity concerns. In this section, we provide an
overview of the datasets, discuss how we validated the data,
and talk about the ethical framework of our study.
A. Description
On February 27, 2022, the Twitter account @ContiLeaks
began tweeting links to an anonymous file sharing service
that contained information related to the Conti Ransomware
collective. In addition to malware source code and other
internal files, the account shared three files of chat logs: two
files containing messages from Conti’s Jabber server and one
file containing messages from Conti’s Rocket.Chat server.
The dataset that we used for our analysis only contained text
(i.e., no images). The leaked chats cover the period from July
2020 to February 2022. The portion of the dataset we analyzed
did not contain any Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
We created a set of regular expressions to extract Bitcoin addresses and confirmed that they were valid addresses. Table II
provides a summary of the the datasets that we analyzed.
B. Validation
The leaked datasets have been extensively validated by the
security community, including the fact that gaps in the chat
logs correlate with times when Conti was disrupted by law
enforcement [16]. In our analysis, Bitcoin addresses included
in the leak are consistent with previously-known Conti Bitcoin
addresses, such as those in the Ransomwhere dataset [17],
with addresses in the leak having received funds from both
Conti payment addresses and Ryuk (another ransomware strain
operated by the same threat group [18]). Furthermore, we do
not observe any internal inconsistencies in the dataset.

C. Ethics
We reason about potentially harms of our study through
the lens of the Menlo report [19]. We have two primary
ethical questions. The first is a high-level question concerning
whether the data being leaked should prima facie prohibit all
subsequent uses of it. For example, should a researcher be
prohibited from analyzing the Facebook leaks in understanding
their policies? We believe that the potential benefits of our
study to society outweigh the minimal increased risks of harm.
We observe that this data is already broadly available and
the knowledge of its existence, its association with the Conti
organization, and information, such as online handles and
amount of Bitcoin transactions, have been publicly documented. Also, there is likely little if any Personally Identifiable
Information (PII) in this leak and we did not find any during
our analysis. This was a criminal service and the usernames
are pseudonyms that are intentionally difficult to link to the
actual persons. Thus, there is a minimal risk of us creating
any new harm from our analysis.
To further manage any remaining harms we institute several
safeguards. We did not attempt to deanonymize anyone in
these leaks as part of our study. Also, we do not use the
publicly-known real names of any Conti employees or affiliates.
IV. M ETHODOLOGY
A. Database Annotation
Jabber, the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol
(XMPP), is a popular messaging application in the cybercrime
underground. The open source instant messenger supports
strong encryption, and independent federated servers that
are located around the world [20]. Well-established cybercrime forums, like Exploit, run their own Jabber servers.
The Conti collective also operated their own Jabber server:
q3mcco35auwcstmt[.]onion.
Similar to other online messengers, the Conti Leaks often
included short text that by itself was absent of any substantive
content. The large number of users (n = 463) within the chats
are often overlapping, and span different parts of the operation.
Additionally, Russian cybercriminals often use specialized
slang, dubbed Феня (Fenya), that is purposefully difficult for a
layperson to understand as it provides shorthand, obfuscation,

and signals group membership [21]. To better prepare the
leaked messages for scientific analysis, we included a mixed
method analysis that included quantitative and qualitative data
analysis.
Our primary objective in analyzing the data is to conduct an
economic on-chain analysis of the cryptocurrency addresses
observed in the dataset. We conducted a regular expression
search within the chat messages to identify all mentions of
Bitcoin addresses. In total, we identified 665 Bitcoin addresses
in the Jabber dataset and 1 Bitcoin address in the Rocket.Chat
dataset. As a result, we primarily focused on the Jabber dataset
for this analysis.
In order to provide context when annotating addresses,
we included 10 messages in a conversation before and 10
messages after each mention of a Bitcoin address. Using this
approach, we were able to augment machine-translated text
with manual translations for Russian slang, label the context
of the Bitcoin address to inform the follow-on economic and
business analysis, and ascribe roles to the Conti ransomware
operators through the context of the chat messages.
To better understand the context of the messages, including
the Russian cybercrime slang, one of our annotators is a native
Russian speaker and expert in the criminal underground. Three
of the authors annotated the addresses, with one author annotating each address. We maintained a Russian slang dictionary
that annotators could reference throughout our analysis.
When reviewing the Bitcoin addresses, we annotated the
addresses according to the following labels:
Salary: The address is associated with a request for salary
or payment. Associates in the chat will often request from a
manager that a salary be transferred to a wallet.
Reimbursement: The address is associated with a request
for reimbursement for a variety of services. Associates may
directly or indirectly request through a manager that funds be
transferred to a wallet for reimbursement of various tools.
Ransom Payment Address: The address is used to receive
payment from a Conti ransomware victim.
Claimed Ownership: A member of the Conti collective
claimed to own the address.
Services: Any services that we can identify being directly
mentioned by the Conti collective.
Victim Name: The name of the victim who made the payment.
Inter-Annotator agreement: To ensure that our annotations
were consistent across researchers, we randomly sampled
100 posts containing cryptocurrency addresses and conducted
a blind annotation with 3 raters. We then measured InterAnnotator Agreement (IAA) by computing Fleiss’ Kappa

for all 3 raters, which yielded a score of 0.73, indicating
substantial agreement [22].
B. Economic On-Chain Measurement
We obtained Bitcoin addresses from the Conti leaks as
well as the Ransomwhere dataset [17]. Ransomwhere is a
public, crowdsourced dataset of ransomware payment addresses, which we use to understand the blockchain techniques
of Conti. We then performed on-chain blockchain analysis,
detailed here, on these addresses.
To enrich our data, we fetched incoming and outgoing
transaction data for all addresses from the blockchain.com
API [23]. We then calculated dollar values for transactions by
multiplying the amount of Bitcoin transacted by the closing
Bitcoin to USD exchange rate the date the transaction was
made from the CoinDesk API [24]. While we cannot know
the exact amount the ransomware actors sold the Bitcoin for,
this serves as an approximation and is consistent with previous
work [6], [25].
Additionally, to understand the types of wallets the
addresses have interacted with, we utilized Crystal
Blockchain [15]. Crystal Blockchain is a blockchain
analytics tool that offers insight into the ownership of Bitcoin
addresses based on a variety of public sources [26]. We
fetched the source and destination entities for all addresses in
the dataset.
In order to gain insight into the proceeds of Conti, we
performed analysis to identify potential ransom payment addresses. Based on confirmed Conti ransom payment addresses
from Ransomwhere and those labeled in our dataset, we found
17 of 32 addresses to exhibit payment splitting, where the
proceeds are immediately split to two wallets according to an
exact percentage. This is likely due to the affiliate structure
of Conti, where affiliates and the Conti core developers split
proceeds. We found that for the 17 split addresses, split
percentages ranged from 5% to 40%, with the most common (9
addresses) being 20%. An example of a split payment is shown
in Figure 1. Note that when we refer to split percentages,
the percentage is the portion of the payment that the Conti
collective keeps, with the remaining portion going to the
affiliate.

Figure 1: An example of splitting. This address received 22
Bitcoin from the US-based Gemini exchange, and split into
25% and 75%. 1 Bitcoin from this address would eventually be
sent to an address in the leak. Other funds were transferred to
other illicit entities, such as the sanctioned exchange Garantex.

In addition to low-risk exchanges such as Gemini, a large
portion of these ransom payments to Conti originate from
an unlabeled cluster of Bitcoin addresses. It is possible that
this cluster belongs to an Over The Counter (OTC) desk,
which many exchanges operate as a way for customers to
exchange cryptocurrency outside of private markets. Given
the significant portion of known Conti ransom payments
originating from this cluster, it is possible that it is used by
a common ransomware negotiator or incident response firm
working with multiple victims. We consider this cluster in
further analysis as a potential origin of Conti payments. Future
work may attempt to identify the owner of this cluster.
We also analyzed 41 ransom payment addresses belonging
to Ryuk from the Ransomwhere dataset. Ryuk is widely
believed to be the predecessor to Conti, and both Conti and
Ryuk have been attributed by Crowdstrike to be operated
by the Wizard Spider group [27]. Of these 41 addresses, 17
exhibited splitting. Split percents ranged from 10% to 50%,
with the most common (6 addresses) being 35%.
To discover other likely ransom payment addresses, we
considered addresses that: (1) sent money (directly or indirectly) to an address in the leaked dataset, (2) exhibited
splitting according to an exact percent that was a multiple
of 5 (e.g. 20%, 25%) and (3) had received more than 99%
of its funds from a low risk exchange (e.g. Gemini) or the
identified unlabeled cluster. Results of this analysis are detailed
in Section V.
While we are able to designate these addresses as likely
ransom payment addresses, the distinction between whether
they are Conti or Ryuk is less clear. Through the course of the
analysis, we observed previously known Ryuk addresses being
used to fund addresses in the leaked Conti dataset, further
suggesting that Conti and Ryuk are operated by the same actor.
As Wizard Spider (an organized cybercrime group that has
been attributed to Conti, Ryuk, TrickBot, and BazarLoader)
paused operating Ryuk in March 2020, which coincided with
the emergence of Conti, we label a likely ransom payment
address as Ryuk if the address was first used before March
2020, and Conti otherwise [18].
C. Qualitative Business Analysis
We extracted the unique aliases (463) from the Conti Leaks,
and created a separate annotation document. We then read
through the full dataset of the Conti Leaks (168,624 messages)
and attempted to categorize the user roles based upon the
content of their conversations. We found that a small number
of individuals comprise a large number of the chats, so we
sorted the aliases by degree centrality to understand who sent
and received the most messages. We then decided to focus on
the top 50 aliases, as most were also observed in our prior
annotation of the cryptocurrency addresses. We maintained a
full list of users, however we chose to focus annotations on
the top 50.
We made the following categories to understand their roles
within the organizations: Role, Direct Report, Working Relationships, Alternative Aliases, and Tasks. While certain

information regarding their respective roles could be gleaned
from the chats, we had to otherwise infer based upon the
context of the discussions, or their working relationships.
V. E CONOMIC A NALYSIS
As with any business, Conti has income and expenses. The
bigger the profit margin, the more its operators can walk
away with. To begin our economic analysis, we utilize the
labeled addresses to understand which addresses represent a
business expense for Conti and which represent income. We
consider reimbursements and salary to be expenses, while
ransom payments are income.
Table III shows the total income and expenses for Conti. Of
the addresses in the leaked dataset, salaries represent the most
in number (419) and the highest dollar value at $21.9 million.
Addresses that are used for both salary and reimbursements
are relatively low in number but represent $5.4 million in
payments. Reimbursements, while lower in dollar value at $3.8
million, have 227 addresses, suggesting that less money goes
to reimbursement wallets on average than salary addresses.
Based on addresses in the leaks alone (the first row of
Table III), expenses exceed income. This is to be expected, as
Conti primarily used its administrator portal to communicate
with victims, while the leaked chat logs appear to be the primary forum for requesting salary payment and reimbursement.
As a result, ransom payment addresses surface in the chat
logs only incidentally, while salaries and reimbursements are
expected.
Nonetheless, we can identify likely ransom payment addresses. Given that Conti’s income comes from ransom payments, and due to the traceable nature of Bitcoin, we can trace
back payments visible in the leaked dataset to the ransom
payments where the funds originate. Using the criteria established in Section IV, we identify 75 likely ransom payment
addresses representing $83.9 million in payments. Of this,
based on the dates Ryuk and Conti were active, we label
$26.5 million as Ryuk payments and $57.4 million as Conti
payments. The largest discovered likely payment of $9.5M is
shown in Figure 2.
Given this perspective, income begins to dwarf expenses. In
addition to leftover money from Ryuk used to fund the Conti
operation, the total Conti income ($77.9 million) is more than
double total expenses ($31.2 million). A significant portion

of the proceeds go directly to the hands of affiliates. Our
numbers are likely incomplete – Chainalysis identified $180
million in proceeds from Conti in 2021 alone [1]. However,
unlike Chainalysis, we have provided our methodology for
identifying ransom payment and we will publicly publish the
addresses.
Table IV shows the most common origins of confirmed and
likely Conti ransom payments. The unlabeled cluster discussed
in Section IV represents a majority of payments – almost
70%. Following that, Gemini composes a significant share at
$23.1 million. The fact that just two exchanges represent the
vast majority of identified payments to Conti suggests strong
intervention points.
We have published the derived likely ransom payment
addresses on GitHub. 1 Notably, the release of these addresses
increases the amount of publicly known Conti payments more
than fivefold – from Ransomwhere’s $17.1 million to $104.4
million.
Next, we consider the sources and funds of funds from
wallets in the leaked dataset, shown in Figure 3. We use money
laundering risk levels provided by Crystal Blockchain to group
exchanges into three categories of low, medium, and high risk.
Consistent with the hypothesis that most money originates
from victim payments, most money originates either from low
risk exchanges or the unlabeled cluster. Moderate-high risk
exchanges, sanctioned exchanges, illegal services, and mixers
represent smaller amounts – suggesting that some Conti actors
might take steps to conceal their funds, though this practice
is not systematized across the group. The receiving profile
varies by type of address – ransom payment funds come almost
exclusively from low risk exchanges or the unlabeled cluster,
while salaries and reimbursements represent a more diverse
portfolio. We speculate that some salaries and reimbursements

are paid from a slush fund belonging to the core operators, and
thus have a variety of sources.
A large portion of wallet transactions, somewhat surprisingly, are to low risk exchanges – exchanges most likely to
abide by Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations. Gemini
and Binance account for a large portion of these funds –
$4.3 million and $2.9 million, respectively. Given Gemini’s
position particularly as a regulated, U.S.-based exchange,
Conti actors may have jeopardized their operational security
by trading there. Other funds wind up in a variety of illicit
destinations, such as $6.8M in Ren Exchange, a peer-to-peer
cross-blockchain exchange that can be used to launder funds,
$2.8M in the Seychelles-based exchange Huobi, and $1.4M in
the now-sanctioned Hydra marketplace.
Of the expanded set of ransom payments, the destination of
funds includes a variety of services used to launder money.
$14.4M is sent to Ren Exchange, $17.9M to Huobi, and
$12.6M to Binance. While both Huobi and Binance enforce
KYC, certain illicit exchanges such as the now-sanctioned
Suex have operated "nested exchanges" within both exchanges,
providing an opportunity to launder funds through otherwiseregulated exchanges [28].
The leaks also offer insight into the individual salaries of
Conti associates. Based on addresses where a Conti associate
appeared to have claimed ownership of the address – most
often a salary address – we compute the highest-grossing associates to be tramp ($1.2M), mango ($470K), baget ($400K),
bullet ($280K), and andy ($98K). We note that this is an
incomplete view into the proceeds of these associates.
We also observe evidence of co-spending among some
associates. Co-spending occurs when two Bitcoin addresses
are used as input to the same transaction, suggesting that the

same entity controls both addresses. We observe two clusters
of associates – viper, jumbo, ganesh and sonar, and sticks,
stakan, elvira, and bekeeper. It is likely that these two clusters
use a shared Bitcoin wallet to manage their funds, or otherwise
share ownership of funds.
VI. B USINESS A NALYSIS
A. Overlap and Re-branding
Conti is assessed to be the successor of the Ryuk RaaS collective, which largely down-scaled their operations in March
2020 [18]. This is evidenced from the leftover revenue that we
identified that was likely used to fund Conti. Ryuk and Conti
shared multiple features, most notably the use of Trickbot for
initial infection.
It is well documented that Trickbot and Conti are both
technically and operationally interconnected [29]. This overlap
is significant to understand some of the roles and structures
within Conti, because there are shared group members duties.
Trickbot provided the initial infection and facilitated the installation of the Conti ransomware on a victim’s machine, similar
to Ryuk [30]. An arrest warrant for a member of the Trickbot
collective, max, indicates that a large number of Trickbot’s
members had also collaborate on the Dyre Trojan, a precursor
to Trickbot. The remaining members of the Dyre collective
transitioned to Trickbot following Dyre’s takedown in 2015
[30]. max’s alias was identified within the Conti Leaks, also
indicating overlap with Trickbot and Conti. Further, the Conti
Leaks Twitter account leaked information from both Trickbot
and Conti, including Trickbot’s wider membership, indicating
that there is approximately 18% overlap with those Trickbot
aliases within Conti’s Jabber.
The indictment of Trickbot malware developers max and
follow-on indictment of ffx provided further details into the

Trickbot organization, which also helped inform our understanding of Conti. Some of the same roles and responsibilities
that were observed within the Trickbot organization were
also observed within Conti, indicating that it was likely a
rebranding as opposed to a reorganization. Trickbot and Conti
also shared similarities in their roles, responsibilities, and
recruiting methods [30], [31].

posting website like Avito, HeadHunter, and Profi[.]ru. Conti
utilized similar recruiting methods, as observed in their Jabber,
and select threads on underground forums.
On August 5, 2021, a disgruntled Conti affiliate m1Geelka
leaked internal training materials, and IP addresses of their
Cobalt Strike servers on XSS, a top tier underground forum.
m1Geelka also commented on an IT recruitment thread from
a user IT_Work, stating that it was an advertisement to
work with Conti. Between June 10, 2021 and September 6,
2021, IT_Work had posted multiple offerings on underground
Russian language forums, like XSS and Exploit, advertising
seemingly legitimate job roles to support large IT projects.
In our research, we assessed that these advertisements for
licit roles were in concert with job postings on Russian-based
freelance websites.

of specialized workers to facilitate different functions. For
example, the unnamed defendants in the Trickbot indictment
included the following roles:
• Malware Manager: Recruiting, hiring, testing malware,
and procuring infrastructure
• Malware Developer: Oversaw functionality within the
development of the malware
• Crypters: Encrypted the malware to prevent detection
from anti-virus
• Spammers: Deployed the malware through targeted and
broad-based phishing campaigns
According to the indictment, Trickbot advertised these roles
on legitimate job posting websites, like LinkedIn and Indeed,
as well as Russia-based freelance websites. After completion
of a programming test, users were added to a private Jabber
OTR communication server where they collaborated on "development, maintenance, and deployment of Trickbot." This
is consistent with our observations of the recruiting methods
used by Conti, which included recruiting for licit roles on job

IT_Work’s posts demonstrate that while RaaS collectives
are commonly associated with illicit tasks, like malware management and development, they also rely on technical talent to
maintain infrastructure. These seemingly licit advertisements,
albeit on underground forums, allowed Conti to recruit witting
and unwitting tech workers to support the infrastructure of
their operation.
Following the Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident on
May 6, 2021, President Biden threatened action against "ransomware networks [32]." As a result, XSS, Exploit, and Raid
Forums banned ransomware advertisements. The leader of
the former Babuk ransomware collective then started their
own dedicated ransomware forum in May 2021, originally
dubbed Payload.bin. The site changed its name to RAMP
(Ransom Anon Market Place). While originally a closed forum
composed of reputable threat actors, RAMP became public
in August 2021 following an extortion attempt. Ransomware
advertisements continued to be available on Telegram and
Jabber [33].
Conti suffered a minor disruption in November 2021 after
details of their infrastructure were reported on by a security
firm [34]. Shortly thereafter, a user JordanConti surfaced on
RAMP highlighting that they were undeterred by the disruption, which included "peripheral IPs and wallets." JordanConti
began openly recruiting for illicit roles required for their
ransomware operation on RAMP, listing the Russian language
as a requirement. The following roles were advertised on
RAMP:
•

Pentesters: "Top networkers who know how to bypass
problematic AVs like Sentinel, work with RMM (Remote
Monitoring Management) and EDR and backups"

Bot herders: "Ideally, people with their own botnet, with
a sufficient number of corp bots, especially in the US."
• Targeted Spammers: "who could beautifully send letters
for "individual recipients" - the priority is USA."
From the Conti Leaks, we were able to ascertain that their
HR specialists were also continuing to recruit on Russianlanguage freelance job posting websites and specialized universities. According to the Jabber chat logs, details of the roles
varied. In a conversation between viper, a hiring representative,
and bourbon, a developer, the reasoning varied from "we do
pentesting for big clients," to more vague responses like "the
work is remote, communication via messenger, the nature of
the work is specific. That’s all I know about conditions." viper
then specified, "We do pen testing, write hacker software exploits, grabbers, spam bots and more."
The legitimacy of the work was often questioned throughout
the Conti leaks, as workers wondered why they had to be paid
in cryptocurrencies, only communicated through encrypted
messenger, and were unaware of the name or actual function
of their employer. It does not appear that Conti used front
companies to obscure their operations, but relied upon their
managers to convey the appropriate messaging of the work.
This meant deceiving their employees, or providing indirect
answers to describe the true nature of their work.
•

C. Team Composition
From the chats, it appears that Conti is divided into several
sub-teams. These teams are generally divided into functional
areas, including management, development and infrastructure,
access operations, and negotiations. These roles are consistent
with the ransomware team structure outlined in the background.
In a chat from mango, a manager that oversees development
and infrastructure, to stern, the organizational leader, mango
shares details of the structure of his team, along with budgeted
salaries:
the main team - $97,447; 52 people
new team - $4,000; 3 people, one has not started
yet
reverse engineering - $23,347; 16 people
research team - $12,500; 6 people
osint intelligence team - $9,000; 4 people
mango’s team does not appear to encompass the whole
Conti operation, however one functional area. The total
monthly salary for their team is assessed to be $146,294.
Other references to a team structure appeared throughout
the chat. For example, in a conversation between target and
poll, target asks if poll needs individuals to attack logistics
and manufacturing. poll highlights that they have a team that
only "locks defense/military companies." In this regard, it
appears that the sector specific targeting is divided between
sub-divisions. However, some sector targeting like healthcare
appeared to be off-limits.

Among RaaS operations as a whole, operators have informally agreed not to target healthcare. Following the DarkSide
attack on Colonial Pipeline, REvil announced several new selfimposed restrictions for its operators and their affiliates. These
announced restrictions included not targeting social sectors
(such as healthcare and education) or any government entities,
as well as requiring ransomware affiliates to get REvil operators’ approval for any future targets. In an interview, LockBit
claimed that they have a, "negative attitude towards those who
encrypt medical and educational institutions." In an exchange
between reshaev, one of Conti’s main developers, and pin, who
is possibly an affiliate, pin defends their reasoning for targeting
a sports treatment center, claiming that it has no resuscitation
unit and they have over 3K in insurance. reshaev emphasizes
that they have a policy prohibiting ransoming healthcare, and
recommends that pin "goes around them now." Despite this
assertion, Conti had ransomed the healthcare sector through
their operation including Ireland’s Health Service Executive
(HSE) and Department of Health (DoH), presumably choosing
money over morals.
In the Conti leaks, there are abstract references to specific
teams. For example, mango introduces themselves as "support
C, manager for general issues of the team trick locker,
now I’m looking for access to work for the gang." buza, a
team lead of coders, in an exchange with hof, a technical
manager, makes abstract reference to "rocket" and "A," likely
meaning Rocket.Chat and team "A" (one of three teams). The
Rocket.Chat messages, though not included in our primary
research, did include details of the team composition of
the access operations. The user alter briefly described the
structure and responsibilities of teams A, B, and C. alter did
not mention the size of the groups, however there were 54
unique aliases in that server.
The current composition is divided into groups,
each group is assigned a team leader (one or two
depending on the size of the group).
D. Primary Actors
To further understand the main actors within the Conti leaks
Jabber, we sorted the aliases by degree centrality. The top five
individuals within the chats, defender, stern, buza, mango, and
bentley, are Conti managers controlling payments, operations,
developers, and malware builds. These managers also fulfilled
HR functions, often sending bulk messages to users with
comments, queries, and reminders to share cryptocurrency addresses for payments. Users that had a lower degree centrality
were likely affiliates or developers. The limited number of
chat messages made their roles much more difficult to identify.
Managers like buza identified their developers by role in bulk
messages that included requests to continue working on a bug
tracker.
Defender also sent bulk messages, not identifying recipients
by role, requesting for alternative forms of communication.
This likely indicates that the leaked Jabber was likely a

centralized communication channel, and other communication
channels may have been used for more specialized operations,
like the Rocket.chat and Trickbot Forum, which included
details on using the Trojan.
The managers have power of the purse. The top five users by
centrality are assessed to be some of the primary leadership,
since their role also included communications with the channel. Requests for funds typically occurred in the Conti leaks
Jabber, with team leads requesting salaries and reimbursement
from managers on the behalf of the individuals on their teams.
This information helped inform us on the hierarchy of the
roles, relationship between aliases, and an understanding of
the team structure.
However, unlike previous cybercrime research that described the importance of cybercrime cultural capital within
communities, the allure of experience and experimentation, it
appears that RaaS operations center around mundane tasks of
operating infrastructure [11], [35]–[37]. The most important
members of the Conti operation appear to be the managers
overseeing the collective work, administering salaries, and
approving expenses for reimbursement.
E. Rewards for Justice
On May 6, 2022, the Department of State offered a $10
million reward for information leading to the identification
or location of the members of Conti collective as part of
the Rewards for Justice program. On August 11, 2022, they
requested specific information on five individuals:
dandis: manager, crypters
professor (aka alter): ransomware negotiator
• reshaev: manager, ransomware builds
• target: manager, access operations
• tramp: manager, operations

•

•

From our research, we identified these individuals as being highly technical managers concerned with crypters, ransomware builds and development, access operations, and victim negotiations. Most of these aliases also appears within the
Trickbot leaks, indicating that this may have overlap with the
aforementioned Trickbot investigation. These individuals were
most likely selected based upon the value that they provide the
Conti collective in achieving a competitive advantage in the
RaaS landscape [38].
On February 9, 2023 (following the initial publication of
this paper), the United States and United Kingdom sanctioned
several members of the Trickbot collective for their role
in cybercrime and ransomware operations [39]. These
individuals also appeared in the Conti Leaks, through the
primary aliases shared in the sanction, or alternative aliases
that helped us identify their membership in the collective.
The following individuals were included in the sanction:
•
•

bentley (aka ben): senior manager
baget: developer

globus: developer
tropa (aka kerasid): money laundering
• iseldor: malicious injects
• mushroom: manager
• strix: administrator
•
•

These sanctions demonstrate a continued focus on cybercrime and ransomware operations. While the Rewards for
Justice identified many of the lead members of Conti by
alias, the sanctions listed the seven individuals by name.
These measures underscore the importance of human capital
in building and maintaining modern ransomware operations.
VII. R ELATED W ORK
In order to conduct our analysis of the Conti ransomware
operation, we use and extend methodologies from cyptocurrency tracking, leaked cybercrime data, and ransomware analysis.
A. Cryptocurrency Tracking
Prior work has shown that Bitcoin wallets and transactions
are often linkable to the same entity using several heuristics [40]–[43]. These Bitcoin tracing heuristics have been
implemented into a number of commercial cryptocurrency
forensic analysis tools which also use techniques to label the
owner of account clusters, such as Chainalysis, TRM Labs,
Elliptic, and Crystal Blockchain. We use Crystal Blockchain’s
cryptocurrency forensic tools to perform analysis of Bitcoin
accounts that we identify in the leaked Conti chat data.
Huang et al. conducted a two year end-to-end measurement
of ransomare operations, tracing bitcoin from acquisition to
ransomware payment. In this analysis, known-victim payments
were identified through seed addresses, and were clustered
with previously unknown-victims. The authors identified ransomware revenue exceeding $16 million USD, and infrastructure that was used to cashout illicit proceeds [6]. PaquetClouston et al. identify $13 million USD in ransomware
payments between 2013 and 2017 [44].
B. Ransomware as a Service
Oosthoek et al. analyze over $100 million in ransom
payments through a crowd-sourced dataset of ransomware
addresses [25]. The authors characterized the shift from commodity ransomware to RaaS. Along with increased profits
came a growing sophistication evidenced by faster time to
launder funds and increased operational security practices.
We build on this work by conducting an in-depth analysis
of a single ransomware groups, which allows us to map over
five times the amount of payments to Conti, in addition to
operating costs which were not previously analyzed.
Previous work has also documented the practice of Ransomware as a Service groups "splitting" payments between
the ransomware group and affiliates. Cong et al. document
DarkSide’s split percentage, which varies based on the size of
the ransom payment [45]. Regarding Conti, Elliptic noted a
22.5% split for several Conti ransom payment addresses [46].

C. Conti

[2]

To date, relatively little academic work has analyzed
the Conti leaks. Cong et al. investigate the cryptocurrency
activities of several notable ransomware groups, including
Conti [45]. The authors compile data from a variety of sources,
including public and proprietary data. As part of their work,
the authors discuss Conti’s activity at a high level, including
analyzing Conti’s posting of victim data on leak sites. Our
work builds on this paper by performing in-depth analysis of
Conti’s economic and business practices, including extracting
and analyzing 666 Bitcoin addresses, compared to the 239
addresses the authors extracted.
Other industry groups have analyzed primarily the business
aspects of the Conti leaks, including ForeScout, Secureworks,
and Check Point [47]–[49].

[4]

VIII. C ONCLUSION
Our study of Conti presents a vignette into the structure of
a modern Ransomware as a Service group. This is the first
comprehensive crypto-economic analysis of the Conti leaks,
based on our annotation of cryptocurrency addresses present in
the leaks, on-chain analysis of cryptocurrency payments, and
qualitative business assessment based upon user conversations.
Through our analysis, we developed a methodology to identify ransom payments based on common splitting behavior. We
use this methodology to identify $83.9 million in new likely
payments and can help to better inform ransomware-affiliated
payments through exchanges. Identifying these payments may
assist cryptocurrency exchanges in blocking these payments,
putting additional pressure on ransomware operators.
We find significant leverage points in both economic and
business areas. The fact that a significant portion of funds both
are received from and sent to low-risk exchanges presents an
opportunity to monitor and seize funds. Further, targeting the
organizational leadership responsible for the recruiting, hiring,
training, and administering the various business units and
infrastructure can also have an impact on their ability to function. The affiliate structure additionally provides opportunities
to disrupt the more technical operators of the ransomware,
thereby preventing affiliates’ ability to lease the malware or
receive operational support.
