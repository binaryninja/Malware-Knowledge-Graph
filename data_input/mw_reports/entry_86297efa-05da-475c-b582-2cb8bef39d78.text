Emotet Adds New Evasion Technique

UPDATE as of May 2, 2019 5AM PDT: A previous version of this blog post speculated
that connected devices were used as part of Emotet’s command-and-control
networks. This was based on speculation derived from Shodan results; that particular
section has been removed from the post. We apologize for any confusion our earlier
speculation may have caused.
Over the years, Emotet, the banking malware discovered by Trend Micro in 2014, has
continued to be a prevalent and costly threat. The United States government estimates that
an Emotet incident takes an organization US $1 million to remediate. Unfortunately, it is a
widespread and particularly resilient malware. Its authors have continuously updated it with
new capabilities, new distribution techniques, and more.
Recently, an analysis of Emotet traffic has revealed that new samples use a different POSTinfection traffic than previous versions. It seems Emotet actors are looking for new ways to
evade detection.

Arrival via spam

1/3

Emotet typically arrives on a victim’s system via spam mail. In the beginning of April,
samples of Emotet show that the malware still spreads via spam, but with the help of the
trojan downloader Powload. The spam messages trick users into downloading malicious files
by claiming that an invoice is attached in the email. The attachment is a ZIP file that can be
opened with the 4-digit password included in the body of the email. A look into the ZIP file
shows that it contains variants of Powload (detected as Trojan.W97M.POWLOAD). If the
user enters the password, the file uses Powershell to download an executable file, which is
Emotet's payload.

Changes in POST-infection traffic
The wave of Emotet samples using new POST-infection traffic has been monitored since
March 15, 2019. Researchers from Malware-Traffic-Analysis.net and Cofense also noted
changes in Emotet’s network traffic around this time. As mentioned previously, Emotet has
undergone many changes since it was first discovered; but this is the first time we have seen
this particular POST-infection traffic technique.
Figure. 2
Figure 2. New Emotet post-infection HTTP Post request traffic
Previous connections from Emotet did not use a URI path, but the newer samples show
randomized words used as a URI directory path (see Figure 2) and a random number of
directory paths. These random words in the URI path help the malware evade networkbased detection. An empty URI path is a red flag, so this technique helps the traffic appear
more legitimate to security solutions.
Below is a list of random words used in the URI path, found in the new sample. We can also
see these same words in the Emotet executable file.

Apart from the URI path, the data in the HTTP POST message body has also changed.
Previous Emotet samples typically used an HTTP GET request to send victim information to
the C&C server, and the data is stored in the Cookie header. The data was encrypted using
an RSA key, AES, and then encoded in Base64 before being added to the Cookie value (see
Figure 4 HTTP request traffic with Cookie header).

2/3

Newer traffic shows something different. Actors stayed away from using the Cookie header
and changed the HTTP request method to POST. The data is still encrypted with an RSA key
and AES, and encoded in Base 64. However, instead of being stored in the Cookie value, it
was put in the body of the HTTP POST message. This change adds another layer of
complexity to help the malware evade detection or delay further investigation if it is detected.

traffic

How can organizations defend themselves?
The change in POST-infection traffic shows that Emotet is still a constantly evolving and
resilient threat. The malware authors are fine-tuning evasion techniques and trying to adapt
to security solutions. If left unchecked and undetected, this threat may lead to a substantial
loss of money and data for businesses.
Combating threats like Emotet calls for a multilayered and proactive approach to security,
protecting all fronts — endpoints, networks, and servers. Trend Micro endpoint solutions
such as Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Suites and Worry-Free™ Business Security can
protect users and businesses from these threats by detecting malicious files and spammed
messages, as well as blocking all related malicious URLs. Enterprises can also monitor all
ports and network protocols for advanced threats and be protected from targeted attacks
with the Trend Micro™ Deep Discovery™ Inspector network appliance.
Deep Discovery Inspector protects customers from these threats via this DDI Rule:
DDI Rule 2897: EMOTET - HTTP (Request) - Variant 4
Trend Micro XGen™ security provides a cross-generational blend of threat defense
techniques against a full range of threats for data centers, cloud environments, networks,
and endpoints. Smart, optimized, and connected, XGen™ powers Trend Micro’s suite of
security solutions: Hybrid Cloud Security, User Protection, and Network Defense.
