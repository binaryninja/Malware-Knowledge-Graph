The Phantom Menace

Operation Oil Tanker:
The Phantom Menace.
Everything started on a cold January day in a
coastal town in the North East of England, an
area with a strong presence of petrochemical
companies.
The day began normally in one of these
companies, a firm specializing in, among other
things, maritime oil transportation. Let’s call this
company “Black Gold”.
John, the head of Black Gold’s IT Department
knows that we live in a dangerous world, and that
companies face thousands of cyber-attacks every
day. And although Black Gold is not included
in the Fortune 1000 company list, John knew
that taking all possible safety precautions is a
must and that, in addition to having a corporate
antivirus, they must maximize all other security
measures.

Thanks to John, Black Gold
joined a high IT security
pilot program.

That’s why when given the opportunity to take
part in a pilot program involving a new service that
monitors all applications running on endpoints,
reporting the security status of the network and
providing forensic information in the event of
infections, he didn’t think twice. After completing a
series of controlled tests, John decided to deploy
the small agent across the company’s network
October 2013.
The information he received during the first three
months helped to identify computers at risk where
vulnerable applications were found. Apart from
that, nothing worth mentioning really happened.

One day, however, while Susan, a secretary with
more than 20 years of experience at Black Gold,
was checking her email as she did every Monday
morning, she came across an email message with
an attached document.
The document appeared to be a PDF file of
approximately 4MB in size, with information about
the oil market. Nothing suspicious. Besides, the
message in question had gone through every
security filter in place. Neither the mail server
antivirus nor the antivirus on her workstation had
found anything anomalous in it.
Susan double-clicked the attachment. A blank
PDF opened. “This must be a mistake. I hope they
realize it and send us the correct file again,” Susan
thought, moving on to the next unread message.
Meanwhile, 1,700 km away from Susan’s computer,
an alarm was triggered. An unknown threat had
just been detected and blocked when it tried to
steal credentials from Susan’s computer and send
them out.
Today, most computer threats are designed to
steal information from target systems, so this
just looked like thousands of cases we examine
in the laboratory every day. However, it caught
our attention that no antivirus engine had been
able to detect it, although this shouldn’t be so
surprising if you take into consideration that every
day over 250,000 new malware files are put in
circulation. There was something really unique
about this threat: it didn’t use any kind of malware.
That’s why we decided to call it the ‘Phantom
Menace’.

Susan just clicked twice,
and the ‘Phantom Menace’
was triggered.

Attack analysis
The file that Susan received and opened looked like this.

It actually was an executable file that used the icon typically used by Adobe Acrobat Reader documents
to trick users.
The figure below illustrates the execution flow:

pic.pdf
stat.vbs
deca.bat
dcp.exe
unzip2.exe
bare.zip

deca.bat
dcp.exe

******
secret

unzip.exe
bar.zip

sai.vbs
ici.bat
cogi.reg
aagi.bat
iei.bat
iewi.bat
di.vbs
keeprun.ini
mdei.abc
image.abc
images.abc
picture viewer.abc

The file is just a self-extracting file. Once run, it creates a folder and extracts six files into it. It then runs
one of them –stat.vbs– and does not take any more actions.
There is no malicious activity, so the file goes unnoticed by behavior-based detectors. The stat.vbs file
simply runs another file –deca.bat– in the background.
This file in turn opens the pic.pdf file (the blank PDF document that opened on Susan’s computer) and runs
a file called dcp.exe, a free tool to encrypt files.
This utility is used to decrypt the following two files:

Next, it uses the unzip.exe program to extract the content of the bare.zip file (12 files) into a different
folder. Then, it runs one of the files: sai.vbs.

None of these actions are anomalous, and actually are very different from what we normally see in other
types of attacks. Here is where the second part of the attack begins:

iei.bat

iei.bat

di.vbs

iewi.bat

iewi.bat

PIC_%d_%t

FTP

The .vbs file runs a .bat file that modifies the Windows registry to ensure that a file called aagi.bat is run
every time the system starts. Then, it makes a copy of the four files with the extension .abc, and changes
their extension to .exe. These are all legitimate applications that anybody could use: the first three are
designed to collect the credentials (user names and passwords) stored in the local mail client and Internet
browser, and save them to a text file.
The fourth one is an application designed to run another application every ‘x’ seconds. This is very useful
for computers that need to run an application at all times, like a browser or any other specific software, so
that if the application closes unexpectedly for some reason it will open again. In this case the application
is configured to run another .bat file every 3,600 seconds (every hour).
Then, the ici.bat file uses the ATTRIB system command to hide the two folders it created, disables the
Windows firewall, and renames the text files containing the credentials to PIC_%d_%t, where %d is the
current date and %t the current time. This is done to indicate when the information they contain was
obtained.
Finally, it uses the FTP command to upload those files to an external FTP server controlled by the
attackers.

Additionally, it runs the file iei.bat every hour, which basically takes the following actions:
.abc

.exe
delete
cogi.reg

iewi.bat

0x01209900 (???)
0x00000004 (4)
0x00020000 (131072)

image.exe
images.exe
picture viewer.exe
rename

PIC_%d_%t

FTP

It renames the .abc files back to .exe, in case they were deleted. It then deletes all the text files with
credentials that were already uploaded to the FTP server, restores the Windows registry key in case it was
deleted, runs the applications designed to collect credentials, renames the resulting files and uploads
them to the FTP server.
As you can see, no malware is ever used in the attack, the hack makes use of legitimate tools and
different scripts to perform the aforementioned actions.
But, is this type of attack really effective? As mentioned before, no antivirus was capable of detecting
it. Furthermore, its peculiarities seem to indicate that the proactive protection layers included in most
antivirus solutions would not be able to detect its apparently harmless behavior.
This was confirmed when we accessed the FTP server that the stolen data was sent to, and found that
the oldest files dated back to August 2013. That is, the attack had been underway for almost six months
completely undetected.

A targeted attack?
Once we accessed the FTP server, the first thing
we did was look for credentials belonging to Black
Gold, since, despite being able to neutralize the
attack on Susan’s computer, another employee
could have fallen victim to it. The result was
negative, no credentials had been stolen from the
company.
However, we were surprised by the large number
of files stored on the FTP server: over 80,000
text files with stolen credentials from other firms.
This didn’t look like a targeted attack, where the
number of victims is usually low.
However, after opening three files at random,
we found that they belonged to three companies
all in the same industrial sector that Black Gold
belongs to.

What didn’t seem a
targeted attack at first,
ended being a whole
conspiratorial plot against
the sector.

As mentioned in the previous section, the attack
took place recurrently every hour. This means that
stolen credentials were sent to the FTP server
every hour. We discarded duplicate files and ended
up with 860 unique files.
That was still too many files for a targeted attack.
The only thing left to do was manually process all
these files and try to identify the victims.
The files belonged to some ten companies, all of
them in the oil and gas maritime transportation
sector.
It was clear that the hack was indeed a targeted
attack, but we still didn’t know what the attackers
were really after, what their final objective was.

Nigeria, scams and oil
The so-called Nigerian scams have been a
constant presence on the Internet since its
inception, and even before that, when fraudsters
used postal mail to defraud victims.
In the most popular one, the scammer passes
themselves off as an important figure in the
Nigerian government or some other institution,
and contacts the victim offering them a share in a
large sum of money that they want to transfer out
of the country.
However, the Nigerian scam industry is large
and varied. Some variants are almost unknown
and affect all kinds of sectors, including the oil
industry.

If the potential buyer is interested, they will ask
for documentary evidence that the product
exists (Proof of Product). There are different
types of documents that can be provided: a
quality certificate, a certificate of origin, a cargo
manifest, or the letter of ATS (Authority to Sell)
issued by the NNPC.
To close the deal, the buyer must pay a significant
amount of money -from $50,000 to $100,000- in
advance. However, once they pay the money they
are met with the nasty surprise that there is no oil.

The Nigerian town of Bonny is well-known in oil
production circles as the oil produced there, known
as Bonny Light Crude Oil (BLCO), has a very low
sulfur content, which makes it a highly desired
grade for its low corrosiveness.
The fact that this particular type of oil is in such
high demand has given rise to a particular type of
scam aimed at oil brokers, individuals who arrange
transactions involving crude oil between buyers
and sellers.

The weakest link in the scam is the documentation
that the scammer must provide to convince the
buyer. Even though all of these documents can
be forged, the fraudster runs the risk of being
discovered by the broker.

In Nigeria, every gas and oil transaction is
supervised by the NNPC (Nigerian National
Petroleum Corporation), a government-owned
company. Anybody who wants to trade with oil in
Nigeria must be registered with the NNPC.

To make it more plausible, scammers attempt to
use real documents so that if the broker wishes to
check their legitimacy, they will see that they are
real.

In short, the scam works like this: the scammer
contacts a broker/middleman and offers them a
large amount of BLCO, one to two million barrels,
at a very competitive price.

However, how difficult is it to obtain these
documents? It is very complicated. The only
way to do it is from companies in the sector. Oil
transportation companies, for example. This was
just a theory, at that time we didn’t have any
evidence to prove that that was the objective
of those responsible for the ‘Phantom Menace’
attack.

Is it possible to know who is
behind the attack?
In most cases, getting to know who is behind
a cyber-attack is very complex, sometimes
impossible.
In this case we were fairly pessimistic. To make it
worse, the fact that no malware had been used
in the attack ruled out the possibility of finding a
signature to examine. However, there was a weak
spot in the attack: the FTP connection used to
send out the stolen credentials.
The information was transmitted using the FTP
command, and as that command was called
by one of the scripts, it was possible to see the
connection used, from where it was established
and the credentials used. The FTP server belonged
to a free service that the attacker had signed
up to, so we were able to access it and see the
information entered when opening the account.
Yes, we were aware that the information would
probably be false, but it was still worth checking.

The password was unknown, they hadn’t used the
same one as for the FTP service. We took the 9
characters that made up the email address and
started combining them to see if we could form an
alias, a first name, a last name or similar. And we
got it.
We googled what looked like a first name and last
name and got a hit. It was the name of a person
with Nigerian nationality and Twitter, Facebook
and LinkedIn accounts, which allowed us to obtain
some more information about him. All those
accounts belonged to a person living in... Ikeja and
who is the owner of a goods transport company.

Ikeja
?????????5@gmail.com

The name used was false; googling it returned
zero results. The country selected was the United
States, which could be false as well. Then we had a
look at the city information. The name in this field
was unknown to us: “Ikeja”.
It turns out that Ikeja is the name of a suburb in
Lagos -the capital city of Nigeria-, also known
as the “Computer Village” as it hosts the nation’s
largest market cluster for technology products.
This information could also be false, but the fact
that whoever opened the account was familiar
with that name meant that they were from Nigeria
themselves or knew the country very well.
Then came the email address. This was the only
element that we knew for sure had to be real and
valid, as it is the address at which users receive
the service activation message, password reset
messages, etc. In this case it was a Gmail address:
*********5@gmail.com

Too many coincidences. So, even though all the
evidence seems to indicate that this is the person
responsible for the attack, there is no way for us
to prove it. It would require the police to launch
an investigation and obtain information about
the FTP connections, etc., in order to get the
IP address of the person who signed up to the
service and find the culprit.

Conclusion
With all the information we had in our hands, the
idea of what to do next was clear: inform the police
so that they could start an investigation and
apprehend whomever was responsible for the hack.
Since one the affected companies was from
Spain, we contacted the Spanish Civil Guard, a
police force that we have collaborated with in
the past and which has a very good reputation
in the fight against cyber-crime. Unfortunately,
they face a difficult-to-solve problem: to start
an investigation they need a victim who reports
the crime. It looks simple, but it isn’t: none of the
victims of this attack is willing to report it.
Why? If our theory is correct, the information stolen
from these companies has not been used against
them, but to defraud other people, oil buyers. It is
for that reason that the companies which have
had their credentials compromised prefer not to
report the attack for fear of having their name
in the spotlight. They prefer to keep a low profile,
change their credentials and continue to operate
just as if nothing had happened.
Some countries have laws that force companies to
report every hacking intrusion where information
is stolen. However, that obligation is usually limited
to incidents in which the stolen information
belongs to a third party (customers, partners, etc.).
In this case, the stolen credentials belonged to
the company under attack, which therefore is not
forced by law to report the theft.
We started this article by calling this case ‘The
Phantom Menace’, due to the nature of the attack
and the absence of malware to perpetrate it.
Continuing with the homage to Star Wars, it is
time to move on to ‘The Force Awakens’: all major
companies must awake to their vulnerability and
realize that absolute security doesn’t exist and
behavior-based protection is limited.

The companies like
Black Gold usually prefer
not to demand this kind of
attacks in order keep them
in anonymity.

They need to go one step further, performing
regular audits in order to assess and address
potential weaknesses in their network security.
Despite traditional security solutions are still
a necessity, they are no longer enough. It is
important to understand that our defense systems
must adapt to the level of attack received, and
so it is necessary to implement new protection
strategies that give organizations total control
and visibility over their networks.
