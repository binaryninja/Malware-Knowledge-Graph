Reports on Computer Systems Technology
The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance the
development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in
federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,
guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities
with industry, government, and academic organizations.

Abstract
This publication provides a catalog of security and privacy controls for federal information
systems and organizations and a process for selecting controls to protect organizational operations
(including mission, functions, image, and reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other
organizations, and the Nation from a diverse set of threats including hostile cyber attacks, natural
disasters, structural failures, and human errors. The controls are customizable and implemented as
part of an organization-wide process that manages information security and privacy risk. The
controls address a diverse set of security and privacy requirements across the federal government
and critical infrastructure, derived from legislation, Executive Orders, policies, directives,
regulations, standards, and/or mission/business needs. The publication also describes how to
develop specialized sets of controls, or overlays, tailored for specific types of missions/business
functions, technologies, or environments of operation. Finally, the catalog of security controls
addresses security from both a functionality perspective (the strength of security functions and
mechanisms provided) and an assurance perspective (the measures of confidence in the
implemented security capability). Addressing both security functionality and security assurance
ensures that information technology products and the information systems built from those
products using sound systems and security engineering principles are sufficiently trustworthy.

FIPS 200 AND SP 800-53
IMPLEMENTING INFORMATION SECURITY STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES

FIPS Publication 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information
Systems, is a mandatory federal standard developed by NIST in response to FISMA. To comply with
the federal standard, organizations first determine the security category of their information
system in accordance with FIPS Publication 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal
Information and Information Systems, derive the information system impact level from the
security category in accordance with FIPS 200, and then apply the appropriately tailored set of
baseline security controls in NIST Special Publication 800-53, Security and Privacy Controls for
Federal Information Systems and Organizations. Organizations have flexibility in applying the
baseline security controls in accordance with the guidance provided in Special Publication 800-53.
This allows organizations to tailor the relevant security control baseline so that it more closely
aligns with their mission and business requirements and environments of operation.
FIPS 200 and NIST Special Publication 800-53, in combination, ensure that appropriate security
requirements and security controls are applied to all federal information and information systems.
An organizational assessment of risk validates the initial security control selection and determines
if additional controls are needed to protect organizational operations (including mission,
functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the
Nation. The resulting set of security controls establishes a level of security due diligence for the
organization.

DEVELOPING COMMON INFORMATION SECURITY FOUNDATIONS
COLLABORATION AMONG PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR ENTITIES

In developing standards and guidelines required by FISMA, NIST consults with other federal
agencies and the private sector to improve information security, avoid unnecessary and costly
duplication of effort, and ensure that its publications are complementary with the standards and
guidelines employed for the protection of national security systems. In addition to a
comprehensive public review and vetting process, NIST is collaborating with the Office of the
Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), the Department of Defense (DoD), and the Committee on
National Security Systems (CNSS) to establish a unified information security framework for the
federal government. A common foundation for information security will provide the Civil,
Defense, and Intelligence sectors of the federal government and their contractors, more costeffective and consistent ways to manage information security-related risk to organizational
operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. The unified framework will
also provide a strong basis for reciprocal acceptance of authorization decisions and facilitate
information sharing. NIST is also working with many public and private sector entities to establish
mappings and relationships between the security standards and guidelines developed by NIST and
the International Organization for Standardization and International Electrotechnical Commission
(ISO/IEC).

SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST

The term security requirement is used by different communities and groups in different ways and
may require additional explanation to establish the particular context for the various use cases.
Security requirements can be stated at a very high level of abstraction, for example, in legislation,
Executive Orders, directives, policies, standards, and mission/business needs statements. FISMA
and FIPS Publication 200 articulate security requirements at such a level.
Acquisition personnel develop security requirements for contracting purposes that address the
protections necessary to achieve mission/business needs. Systems/security engineers, system
developers, and systems integrators develop the security design requirements for the information
system, develop the system security architecture and the architecture-specific derived security
requirements, and subsequently implement specific security functions at the hardware, software,
and firmware component level.
Security requirements are also reflected in various nontechnical security controls that address
such matters as policy and procedures at the management and operational elements within
organizations, again at differing levels of detail. It is important to define the context for each use of
the term security requirement so the respective communities (including individuals responsible for
policy, architecture, acquisition, engineering, and mission/business protection) can clearly
communicate their intent.
Organizations may define certain security capabilities needed to satisfy security requirements and
provide appropriate mission and business protection. Security capabilities are typically defined by
bringing together a specific set of safeguards/countermeasures (i.e., security controls) derived
from the appropriately tailored baselines that together produce the needed capability.

TECHNOLOGY AND POLICY NEUTRALITY
CHARACTERISTICS OF SECURITY CONTROLS

The security controls in the catalog with few exceptions, have been designed to be policy- and
technology-neutral. This means that security controls and control enhancements focus on the
fundamental safeguards and countermeasures necessary to protect information during
processing, while in storage, and during transmission. Therefore, it is beyond the scope of this
publication to provide guidance on the application of security controls to specific technologies,
environments of operation, communities of interest, or missions/business functions. Applicationspecific areas are addressed by the use of the tailoring process described in Chapter Three and the
use of overlays described in Appendix I. It should also be noted that while the security controls are
largely policy- and technology-neutral, that does not imply that the controls are policy- and
technology-unaware. Understanding policy and technology is necessary so that the controls are
meaningful and relevant when implemented.
In the few cases where specific technologies are called out in security controls (e.g., mobile, PKI,
wireless, VOIP), organizations are cautioned that the need to provide adequate security goes well
beyond the requirements in a single control associated with a particular technology. Many of the
needed safeguards and countermeasures are obtained from the other security controls in the
catalog allocated to the initial control baselines as starting points for the development of security
plans and overlays using the tailoring process. There may also be some overlap in the protections
articulated by the security controls within the different control families.
In addition to the customer-driven development of specialized security plans and overlays, NIST
Special Publications and Interagency Reports may provide guidance on recommended security
controls for specific technologies and sector-specific applications (e.g., Smart Grid, healthcare,
Industrial Control Systems, and mobile).
Employing a technology- and policy-neutral security control catalog has the following benefits:
• It encourages organizations to focus on the security capabilities required for mission/business
success and the protection of information, irrespective of the information technologies that are
employed in organizational information systems.
• It encourages organizations to analyze each security control for its applicability to specific
technologies, environments of operation, missions/business functions, and communities of
interest.
• It encourages organizations to specify security policies as part of the tailoring process for security
controls that have variable parameters.
The specialization of security plans using the tailoring guidance and overlays, together with a robust
set of technology- and policy-neutral security controls, promotes cost-effective, risk-based
information security for organizations—in any sector, for any technology, and in any operating
environment.

INFORMATION SECURITY DUE DILIGENCE
MANAGING THE RISK TO ORGANIZATIONAL MISSIONS/BUSINESS FUNCTIONS

The security controls in NIST Special Publication 800-53 are designed to facilitate compliance with
applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and
guidance. Compliance is not about adhering to static checklists or generating unnecessary FISMA
reporting paperwork. Rather, compliance necessitates organizations executing due diligence with
regard to information security and risk management. Information security due diligence includes
using all appropriate information as part of an organization-wide risk management program to
effectively use the tailoring guidance and inherent flexibility in NIST publications so that the
selected security controls documented in organizational security plans meet the mission and
business requirements of organizations. Using the risk management tools and techniques that are
available to organizations is essential in developing, implementing, and maintaining the
safeguards and countermeasures with the necessary and sufficient strength of mechanism to
address the current threats to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other
organizations, and the Nation. Employing effective risk-based processes, procedures, and
technologies will help ensure that all federal information systems and organizations have the
necessary resilience to support ongoing federal responsibilities, critical infrastructure applications,
and continuity of government.

PRIVACY CONTROLS
PROVIDING PRIVACY PROTECTION FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION

Appendix J, Privacy Control Catalog, is a new addition to NIST Special Publication 800-53. It is
intended to address the privacy needs of federal agencies. The Privacy Appendix:
•

Provides a structured set of privacy controls, based on best practices, that help organizations
comply with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, instructions, regulations,
policies, standards, guidance, and organization-specific issuances;

•

Establishes a linkage and relationship between privacy and security controls for purposes of
enforcing respective privacy and security requirements which may overlap in concept and in
implementation within federal information systems, programs, and organizations;

•

Demonstrates the applicability of the NIST Risk Management Framework in the selection,
implementation, assessment, and ongoing monitoring of privacy controls deployed in federal
information systems, programs, and organizations; and

•

Promotes closer cooperation between privacy and security officials within the federal
government to help achieve the objectives of senior leaders/executives in enforcing the
requirements in federal privacy legislation, policies, regulations, directives, standards, and
guidance.

There is a strong similarity in the structure of the privacy controls in Appendix J and the security
controls in Appendices F and G. For example, the control AR-1 (Governance and Privacy Program)
requires organizations to develop privacy plans that can be implemented at the organizational or
program level. These plans can also be used in conjunction with security plans to provide an
opportunity for organizations to select the appropriate set of security and privacy controls in
accordance with organizational mission/business requirements and the environments in which the
organizations operate. Incorporating the same concepts used in managing information security
risk, helps organizations implement privacy controls in a more cost-effective, risked-based manner
while simultaneously protecting individual privacy and meeting compliance requirements.
Standardized privacy controls provide a more disciplined and structured approach for satisfying
federal privacy requirements and demonstrating compliance to those requirements.

CAUTIONARY NOTE
IMPLEMENTING CHANGES BASED ON REVISIONS TO SPECIAL PUBLICATION 800-53

When NIST publishes revisions to Special Publication 800-53, there are four primary types of
changes made to the document: (i) security controls or control enhancements are added to or
withdrawn from Appendices F and G and/or to the low, moderate, and high baselines; (ii)
supplemental guidance is modified; (iii) material in the main chapters or appendices is modified;
and (iv) language is clarified and/or updated throughout the document.
When modifying existing tailored security control baselines at Tier 3 in the risk management
hierarchy (as described in Special Publication 800-39) and updating security controls at any tier as
a result of Special Publication 800-53 revisions, organizations should take a measured, risk-based
approach in accordance with organizational risk tolerance and current risk assessments. Unless
otherwise directed by OMB policy, the following activities are recommended to implement
changes to Special Publication 800-53:
• First, organizations determine if any added security controls/control enhancements are
applicable to organizational information systems or environments of operation following
tailoring guidelines in this publication.
• Next, organizations review changes to the supplemental guidance, guidance in the main
chapters and appendices, and updated/clarified language throughout the publication to
determine if changes apply to any organizational information systems and if any immediate
actions are required.
• Finally, once organizations have determined the entirety of changes necessitated by the
revisions to the publication, the changes are integrated into the established continuous
monitoring process to the greatest extent possible. The implementation of new or modified
security controls to address specific, active threats is always the highest priority for sequencing
and implementing changes. Modifications such as changes to templates or minor language
changes in policy or procedures are generally the lowest priority and are made in conjunction
with established review cycles.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Foreword
NIST Special Publication 800-53, Revision 4, represents the most comprehensive update to the
security controls catalog since its inception in 2005. The publication was developed by NIST, the
Department of Defense, the Intelligence Community, and the Committee on National Security
Systems as part of the Joint Task Force, an interagency partnership formed in 2009. This update
was motivated principally by the expanding threat space—characterized by the increasing
sophistication of cyber attacks and the operations tempo of adversaries (i.e., the frequency of such
attacks, the professionalism of the attackers, and the persistence of targeting by attackers). Stateof-the-practice security controls and control enhancements have been developed and integrated
into the catalog addressing such areas as: mobile and cloud computing; applications security;
trustworthiness, assurance, and resiliency of information systems; insider threat; supply chain
security; and the advanced persistent threat. In addition, Special Publication 800-53 has been
expanded to include eight new families of privacy controls based on the internationally accepted
Fair Information Practice Principles.
Special Publication 800-53, Revision 4, provides a more holistic approach to information security
and risk management by providing organizations with the breadth and depth of security controls
necessary to fundamentally strengthen their information systems and the environments in which
those systems operate—contributing to systems that are more resilient in the face of cyber attacks
and other threats. This “Build It Right” strategy is coupled with a variety of security controls for
“Continuous Monitoring” to give organizations near real-time information that is essential for
senior leaders making ongoing risk-based decisions affecting their critical missions and business
functions.
To take advantage of the expanded set of security and privacy controls, and to give organizations
greater flexibility and agility in defending their information systems, the concept of overlays was
introduced in this revision. Overlays provide a structured approach to help organizations tailor
security control baselines and develop specialized security plans that can be applied to specific
missions/business functions, environments of operation, and/or technologies. This specialization
approach is important as the number of threat-driven controls and control enhancements in the
catalog increases and organizations develop risk management strategies to address their specific
protection needs within defined risk tolerances.
Finally, there have been several new features added to this revision to facilitate ease of use by
organizations. These include:
•

Assumptions relating to security control baseline development;

•

Expanded, updated, and streamlined tailoring guidance;

•

Additional assignment and selection statement options for security and privacy controls;

•

Descriptive names for security and privacy control enhancements;

•

Consolidated tables for security controls and control enhancements by family with
baseline allocations;

•

Tables for security controls that support development, evaluation, and operational
assurance; and

•

Mapping tables for international security standard ISO/IEC 15408 (Common Criteria).

________________________________________________________________________________________________

The security and privacy controls in Special Publication 800-53, Revision 4, have been designed
to be largely policy/technology-neutral to facilitate flexibility in implementation. The controls are
well positioned to support the integration of information security and privacy into organizational
processes including enterprise architecture, systems engineering, system development life cycle,
and acquisition/procurement. Successful integration of security and privacy controls into ongoing
organizational processes will demonstrate a greater maturity of security and privacy programs and
provide a tighter coupling of security and privacy investments to core organizational missions and
business functions.

CHAPTER ONE

INTRODUCTION
THE NEED TO PROTECT INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS

he selection and implementation of security controls for information systems 1 and
organizations are important tasks that can have major implications on the operations 2 and
assets of organizations 3 as well as the welfare of individuals and the Nation. Security
controls are the safeguards/countermeasures prescribed for information systems or organizations
that are designed to: (i) protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information that is
processed, stored, and transmitted by those systems/organizations; and (ii) satisfy a set of defined
security requirements. 4 There are several key questions that should be answered by organizations
when addressing the information security considerations for information systems:

T

•

What security controls are needed to satisfy the security requirements and to adequately
mitigate risk incurred by using information and information systems in the execution of
organizational missions and business functions?

•

Have the security controls been implemented, or is there an implementation plan in place?

•

What is the desired or required level of assurance that the selected security controls, as
implemented, are effective in their application? 5

The answers to these questions are not given in isolation but rather in the context of an effective
risk management process for the organization that identifies, mitigates as deemed necessary, and
monitors on an ongoing basis, risks 6 arising from its information and information systems. NIST
Special Publication 800-39 provides guidance on managing information security risk at three
distinct tiers—the organization level, mission/business process level, and information system
level. The security controls defined in this publication and recommended for use by organizations
to satisfy their information security requirements should be employed as part of a well-defined
risk management process that supports organizational information security programs. 7

1

An information system is a discrete set of information resources organized expressly for the collection, processing,
maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information. Information systems also include specialized
systems such as industrial/process controls systems, telephone switching/private branch exchange (PBX) systems, and
environmental control systems.
2

Organizational operations include mission, functions, image, and reputation.

3

The term organization describes an entity of any size, complexity, or positioning within an organizational structure
(e.g., a federal agency or, as appropriate, any of its operational elements).
4

Security requirements are derived from mission/business needs, laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations,
policies, instructions, standards, guidance, and/or procedures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
the information being processed, stored, or transmitted by organizational information systems.
5

Security control effectiveness addresses the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as
intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the information
system in its operational environment or enforcing/mediating established security policies.
6
Information security-related risks are those risks that arise from the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of
information or information systems and consider the potential adverse impacts to organizational operations and assets,
individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.
7
The program management controls (Appendix G) complement the security controls for an information system
(Appendix F) by focusing on the organization-wide information security requirements that are independent of any
particular information system and are essential for managing information security programs.

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

It is of paramount importance that responsible officials understand the risks and other factors that
could adversely affect organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and
the Nation. 8 These officials must also understand the current status of their security programs and
the security controls planned or in place to protect their information and information systems in
order to make informed judgments and investments that mitigate risks to an acceptable level. The
ultimate objective is to conduct the day-to-day operations of the organization and accomplish the
organization’s stated missions and business functions with what the OMB Circular A-130 defines
as adequate security, or security commensurate with risk resulting from the unauthorized access,
use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information.

1.1 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY
The purpose of this publication is to provide guidelines for selecting and specifying security
controls for organizations and information systems supporting the executive agencies of the
federal government to meet the requirements of FIPS Publication 200, Minimum Security
Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems. The guidelines apply to all
components 9 of an information system that process, store, or transmit federal information. The
guidelines have been developed to achieve more secure information systems and effective risk
management within the federal government by:
•

Facilitating a more consistent, comparable, and repeatable approach for selecting and
specifying security controls for information systems and organizations;

•

Providing a stable, yet flexible catalog of security controls to meet current information
protection needs and the demands of future protection needs based on changing threats,
requirements, and technologies;

•

Providing a recommendation for security controls for information systems categorized in
accordance with FIPS Publication 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal
Information and Information Systems;

•

Creating a foundation for the development of assessment methods and procedures for
determining security control effectiveness; and

•

Improving communication among organizations by providing a common lexicon that
supports discussion of risk management concepts.

In addition to the security controls described above, this publication: (i) provides a set of
information security program management (PM) controls that are typically implemented at the
organization level and not directed at individual organizational information systems; (ii)
provides a set of privacy controls based on international standards and best practices that help
organizations enforce privacy requirements derived from federal legislation, directives, policies,
regulations, and standards; and (iii) establishes a linkage and relationship between privacy and
security controls for purposes of enforcing respective privacy and security requirements which
may overlap in concept and in implementation within federal information systems, programs,
and organizations. Standardized privacy controls provide a more disciplined and structured
approach for satisfying federal privacy requirements and demonstrating compliance to those
8

This includes risk to critical infrastructure/key resources described in Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7.

9

Information system components include, for example, mainframes, workstations, servers (e.g., database, electronic
mail, authentication, web, proxy, file, domain name), input/output devices (e.g., scanners, copiers, printers), network
components (e.g., firewalls, routers, gateways, voice and data switches, process controllers, wireless access points,
network appliances, sensors), operating systems, virtual machines, middleware, and applications.

requirements. Incorporating the same concepts used in managing information security risk,
helps organizations implement privacy controls in a more cost-effective, risked-based manner.
The guidelines in this special publication are applicable to all federal information systems 10
other than those systems designated as national security systems as defined in 44 U.S.C.,
Section 3542. 11 The guidelines have been broadly developed from a technical perspective to
complement similar guidelines for national security systems and may be used for such systems
with the approval of appropriate federal officials exercising policy authority over such
systems. 12 State, local, and tribal governments, as well as private sector organizations are
encouraged to consider using these guidelines, as appropriate.

1.2 TARGET AUDIENCE
This publication is intended to serve a diverse audience of information system and information
security professionals including:
•

Individuals with information system, security, and/or risk management and oversight
responsibilities (e.g., authorizing officials, chief information officers, senior information
security officers, 13 information system managers, information security managers);

•

Individuals with information system development responsibilities (e.g., program managers,
system designers and developers, information security engineers, systems integrators);

•

Individuals with information security implementation and operational responsibilities (e.g.,
mission/business owners, information system owners, common control providers, information
owners/stewards, system administrators, information system security officers);

•

Individuals with information security assessment and monitoring responsibilities (e.g.,
auditors, Inspectors General, system evaluators, assessors, independent verifiers/validators,
analysts, information system owners); and

•

Commercial companies producing information technology products and systems, creating
information security-related technologies, or providing information security services.

1.3 RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER SECURITY CONTROL PUBLICATIONS
To create a technically sound and broadly applicable set of security controls for information
systems and organizations, a variety of sources were considered during the development of this
special publication. The sources included security controls from the defense, audit, financial,
healthcare, industrial/process control, and intelligence communities as well as controls defined by
10
A federal information system is an information system used or operated by an executive agency, by a contractor of an
executive agency, or by another organization on behalf of an executive agency.
11
A national security system is any information system (including any telecommunications system) used or operated by
an agency or by a contractor of an agency, or other organization on behalf of an agency: (i) the function, operation, or
use of which involves intelligence activities; involves cryptologic activities related to national security; involves
command and control of military forces; involves equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or weapons system; or
is critical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence missions (excluding a system that is to be used for routine
administrative and business applications, e.g., payroll, finance, logistics, and personnel management applications); or
(ii) is protected at all times by procedures established for information that have been specifically authorized under
criteria established by an Executive Order or an Act of Congress to be kept classified in the interest of national defense
or foreign policy.
12

CNSS Instruction 1253 provides implementing guidance for national security systems.

13

At the agency level, this position is known as the Senior Agency Information Security Officer. Organizations may
also refer to this position as the Senior Information Security Officer or the Chief Information Security Officer.

national and international standards organizations. The objective of NIST Special Publication
800-53 is to provide a set of security controls that can satisfy the breadth and depth of security
requirements 14 levied on organizations, mission/business processes, and information systems and
that is consistent with and complementary to other established information security standards.
The catalog of security controls in Special Publication 800-53 can be effectively used to protect
information and information systems from traditional and advanced persistent threats in varied
operational, environmental, and technical scenarios. The controls can also be used to demonstrate
compliance with a variety of governmental, organizational, or institutional security requirements.
Organizations have the responsibility to select the appropriate security controls, to implement the
controls correctly, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the controls in satisfying established
security requirements. 15 The security controls facilitate the development of assessment methods
and procedures that can be used to demonstrate control effectiveness in a consistent/repeatable
manner—thus contributing to the organization’s confidence that security requirements continue to
be satisfied on an ongoing basis. In addition, security controls can be used in developing overlays
for specialized information systems, information technologies, environments of operation, or
communities of interest (see Appendix I).

1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES
Organizations use FIPS Publication 199 to categorize their information and information systems.
Security categorization is accomplished as an organization-wide activity 16 with the involvement
of senior-level organizational personnel including, for example, authorizing officials, chief
information officers, senior information security officers, information owners and/or stewards,
information system owners, and risk executive (function). 17 Information is categorized at Tier 1
(organization level) and at Tier 2 (mission/business process level). In accordance with FIPS
Publication 200, organizations use the security categorization results from Tiers 1 and 2 to
designate organizational information systems at Tier 3 (information system level) as low-impact,
moderate-impact, or high-impact systems. For each organizational information system at Tier 3,
the recommendation for security controls from the baseline controls defined in Appendix D is the
starting point for the security control tailoring process. While the security control selection
process is generally focused on information systems at Tier 3, the process is generally applicable
across all three tiers of risk management.
FIPS Publication 199 security categorization associates information and the operation and use of
information systems with the potential worst-case adverse impact on organizational operations
and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. 18 Organizational assessments of risk,
including the use of specific and credible threat information, vulnerability information, and the
likelihood of such threats exploiting vulnerabilities to cause adverse impacts, guide and inform
14

Security requirements are those requirements levied on an information system that are derived from laws, Executive
Orders, directives, policies, instructions, regulations, standards, guidelines, or organizational (mission) needs to ensure
the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information being processed, stored, or transmitted.
15

NIST Special Publication 800-53A provides guidance on assessing the effectiveness of security controls.

16

See FIPS Publication 200, Footnote 7.

17

Organizations typically exercise managerial, operational, and financial control over their information systems and the
security provided to those systems, including the authority and capability to implement or require the security controls
deemed necessary to protect organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.
18
Considerations for potential national-level impacts and impacts to other organizations in categorizing organizational
information systems derive from the USA PATRIOT Act and Homeland Security Presidential Directives (HSPDs).

the tailoring process and the final selection of security controls. 19 The final, agreed-upon set of
security controls addressing specific organizational mission/business needs and tolerance for risk
is documented with appropriate rationale in the security plan for the information system. 20 The
use of security controls from Special Publication 800-53 (including the baseline controls as a
starting point in the control selection process), facilitates a more consistent level of security for
federal information systems and organizations, while simultaneously preserving the flexibility
and agility organizations need to address an increasingly sophisticated and hostile threat space,
specific organizational missions/business functions, rapidly changing technologies, and in some
cases, unique environments of operation.
Achieving adequate information security for organizations, mission/business processes, and
information systems is a multifaceted undertaking that requires:
•

Clearly articulated security requirements and security specifications;

•

Well-designed and well-built information technology products based on state-of-the-practice
hardware, firmware, and software development processes;

•

Sound systems/security engineering principles and practices to effectively integrate
information technology products into organizational information systems;

•

Sound security practices that are well documented and seamlessly integrated into the training
requirements and daily routines of organizational personnel with security responsibilities;

•

Continuous monitoring of organizations and information systems to determine the ongoing
effectiveness of deployed security controls, changes in information systems and environments
of operation, and compliance with legislation, directives, policies, and standards; 21 and

•

Information security planning and system development life cycle management. 22

From an engineering viewpoint, information security is just one of many required operational
capabilities for information systems that support organizational mission/business processes—
capabilities that must be funded by organizations throughout the system development life cycle in
order to achieve mission/business success. It is important that organizations realistically assess
the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation
arising from mission/business processes and by placing information systems into operation or
continuing operations. Realistic assessment of risk requires an understanding of threats to and
vulnerabilities within organizations and the likelihood and potential adverse impacts of successful
exploitations of such vulnerabilities by those threats. 23 Finally, information security requirements
must be satisfied with the full knowledge and consideration of the risk management strategy of

19

Risk assessments can be accomplished in a variety of ways depending on the specific needs of organizations. NIST
Special Publication 800-30 provides guidance on the assessment of risk as part of an overall risk management process.
20
Authorizing officials or designated representatives, by accepting the completed security plans, agree to the set of
security controls proposed to meet the security requirements for organizations (including mission/business processes)
and/or designated information systems.
21

NIST Special Publication 800-137 provides guidance on continuous monitoring of organizational information
systems and environments of operation.

NIST Special Publication 800-64 provides guidance on the information security considerations in the system
development life cycle.

THE FUNDAMENTALS
SECURITY CONTROL STRUCTURE, ORGANIZATION, BASELINES, AND ASSURANCE

T

his chapter presents the fundamental concepts associated with security control selection
and specification including: (i) three-tiered risk management; (ii) the structure of security
controls and the organization of the controls in the control catalog; (iii) security control
baselines; (iv) the identification and use of common security controls; (v) security controls in
external environments; (vi) security control assurance; and (vii) future revisions to the security
controls, the control catalog, and baseline controls.

2.1 MULTITIERED RISK MANAGEMENT
The selection and specification of security controls for an information system is accomplished as
part of an organization-wide information security program for the management of risk—that is,
the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation
associated with the operation of information systems. Risk-based approaches to security control
selection and specification consider effectiveness, efficiency, and constraints due to applicable
federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. To
integrate the risk management process throughout the organization and more effectively address
mission/business concerns, a three-tiered approach is employed that addresses risk at the: (i)
organization level; (ii) mission/business process level; and (iii) information system level. The risk
management process is carried out across the three tiers with the overall objective of continuous
improvement in the organization’s risk-related activities and effective inter-tier and intra-tier
communication among all stakeholders having a shared interest in the mission/business success of
the organization. Figure 1 illustrates the three-tiered approach to risk management.

Tier 1 provides a prioritization of organizational missions/business functions which in turn drives
investment strategies and funding decisions—promoting cost-effective, efficient information
technology solutions consistent with the strategic goals and objectives of the organization and
measures of performance. Tier 2 includes: (i) defining the mission/business processes needed to
support the organizational missions/business functions; (ii) determining the security categories of
the information systems needed to execute the mission/business processes; (iii) incorporating
information security requirements into the mission/business processes; and (iv) establishing an
enterprise architecture (including an embedded information security architecture) to facilitate the
allocation of security controls to organizational information systems and the environments in
which those systems operate. The Risk Management Framework (RMF), depicted in Figure 2, is
the primary means for addressing risk at Tier 3. 27 This publication focuses on Step 2 of the RMF,
the security control selection process, in the context of the three tiers in the organizational risk
management hierarchy.

Step 1: Categorize the information system based on a FIPS Publication 199 impact assessment; 28
Step 2: Select the applicable security control baseline based on the results of the security
categorization and apply tailoring guidance (including the potential use of overlays);
Step 3: Implement the security controls and document the design, development, and
implementation details for the controls;
Step 4: Assess the security controls to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented
correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the
security requirements for the system; 29
Step 5: Authorize information system operation based on a determination of risk to organizational
operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation resulting from the
operation and use of the information system and the decision that this risk is acceptable; and
Step 6: Monitor the security controls in the information system and environment of operation on
an ongoing basis to determine control effectiveness, changes to the system/environment, and
compliance to legislation, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards.

2.2 SECURITY CONTROL STRUCTURE
Security controls described in this publication have a well-defined organization and structure. For
ease of use in the security control selection and specification process, controls are organized into
eighteen families. 30 Each family contains security controls related to the general security topic of
the family. A two-character identifier uniquely identifies security control families, for example,
PS (Personnel Security). Security controls may involve aspects of policy, oversight, supervision,
manual processes, actions by individuals, or automated mechanisms implemented by information
systems/devices. Table 1 lists the security control families and the associated family identifiers in
the security control catalog. 31

Of the eighteen security control families in NIST Special Publication 800-53, seventeen families are described in the
security control catalog in Appendix F, and are closely aligned with the seventeen minimum security requirements for
federal information and information systems in FIPS Publication 200. One additional family (Program Management
[PM] family) provides controls for information security programs required by FISMA. This family, while not
specifically referenced in FIPS Publication 200, provides security controls at the organization level rather than the
information system level. See Appendix G for a description of and implementation guidance for the PM controls.
31

Privacy controls listed in Appendix J, have an organization and structure similar to security controls, including the
use of two-character identifiers for the eight privacy families.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

The security control structure consists of the following components: (i) a control section; (ii) a
supplemental guidance section; (iii) a control enhancements section; (iv) a references section;
and (v) a priority and baseline allocation section. The following example from the Auditing and
Accountability family illustrates the structure of a typical security control.
AU-3

CONTENT OF AUDIT RECORDS
Control: The information system generates audit records containing information that establishes
what type of event occurred, when the event occurred, where the event occurred, the source of the
event, the outcome of the event, and the identity of any individuals or subjects associated with the
event.
Supplemental Guidance: Audit record content that may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of

this control includes, for example, time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process
identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, filenames involved, and access control or
flow control rules invoked. Event outcomes can include indicators of event success or failure and
event-specific results (e.g., the security state of the information system after the event occurred).
Related controls: AU-2, AU-8, AU-12, SI-11.
Control Enhancements:
(1)

CONTENT OF AUDIT RECORDS | ADDITIONAL AUDIT INFORMATION

The information system generates audit records containing the following additional information:
[Assignment: organization-defined additional, more detailed information].
Supplemental Guidance: Detailed information that organizations may consider in audit records

includes, for example, full-text recording of privileged commands or the individual identities
of group account users. Organizations consider limiting the additional audit information to
only that information explicitly needed for specific audit requirements. This facilitates the use
of audit trails and audit logs by not including information that could potentially be misleading
or could make it more difficult to locate information of interest.
(2)

CONTENT OF AUDIT RECORDS | CENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT OF PLANNED AUDIT RECORD CONTENT

The information system provides centralized management and configuration of the content to be
captured in audit records generated by [Assignment: organization-defined information system
components].
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement requires that the content to be captured in
audit records be configured from a central location (necessitating automation). Organizations
coordinate the selection of required audit content to support the centralized management and
configuration capability provided by the information system. Related controls: AU-6, AU-7.
References: None.
Priority and Baseline Allocation:
P1

LOW AU-3

MOD AU-3 (1)

HIGH AU-3 (1) (2)

The control section prescribes specific security-related activities or actions to be carried out by
organizations or by information systems. The term information system refers to those functions
that generally involve the implementation of information technology (e.g., hardware, software,
and firmware). Conversely, the term organization refers to activities that are generally processdriven or entity-driven—that is, the security control is generally implemented through human or
procedural-based actions. Security controls that use the term organization may still require some
degree of automation to be fulfilled. Similarly, security controls that use the term information
system may have some elements that are process-driven or entity-driven. Using the terms
organization and/or information system does not preclude the application of security controls at
any of the tiers in the risk management hierarchy (i.e., organization level, mission/business
process level, information system level), as appropriate.

CHAPTER 2

PAGE 10

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

For some security controls in the control catalog, a degree of flexibility is provided by allowing
organizations to define values for certain parameters associated with the controls. This flexibility
is achieved through the use of assignment and selection statements embedded within the security
controls and control enhancements. Assignment and selection statements provide organizations
with the capability to tailor security controls and control enhancements based on: (i) security
requirements to support organizational missions/business functions and operational needs; (ii)
risk assessments and organizational risk tolerance; and (iii) security requirements originating in
federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, or guidelines. 32
For example, organizations can specify additional information needed for audit records to support
audit event processing. See the AU-3(1) example above (i.e., [Assignment: organization-defined
additional, more detailed information]). These assignments may include particular actions to be
taken by information systems in the event of audit failures, the frequency of conducting system
backups, restrictions on password use, or the distribution list for organizational policies and
procedures. 33 Once specified, 34 the organization-defined values for assignment and selection
statements become part of the security control, and the control implementation is assessed against
the completed control statement. Assignment statements offer a high degree of flexibility by
allowing organizations to specify parameter values, without requiring those values to be one of
two or more specific predefined choices. In contrast, selection statements narrow the potential
input values by providing a specific list of items from which organizations must choose. 35
The supplemental guidance section provides non-prescriptive, additional information for a
specific security control. Organizations can apply the supplemental guidance as appropriate,
when defining, developing, and/or implementing security controls. The supplemental guidance
can provide important considerations for implementing security controls in the context of
operational environments, mission/business requirements, or assessments of risk and can also
explain the purpose or meaning of particular controls. Security control enhancements may also
contain supplemental guidance when the guidance is not applicable to the entire control but
instead focused on a particular control enhancement. The supplemental guidance sections for
security controls and control enhancements may contain a list of related controls. Related
controls: (i) directly impact or support the implementation of a particular security control or
control enhancement; (ii) address a closely related security capability; or (iii) are referenced in
the supplemental guidance. Security control enhancements are by definition related to the base
control. Related controls that are listed in the supplemental guidance for the base controls are not
repeated in the supplemental guidance for the control enhancements. However, there may be
related controls identified for control enhancements that are not listed in the base control.
The security control enhancements section provides statements of security capability to: (i) add
functionality/specificity to a control; and/or (ii) increase the strength of a control. In both cases,
control enhancements are used in information systems and environments of operation requiring
32

In general, organization-defined parameters used in assignment and selection statements in the basic security
controls apply also to all control enhancements associated with those controls.
33
Organizations determine whether specific assignment or selection statements are completed at Tier 1 (organization
level), Tier 2 (mission/business process level), Tier 3 (information system level), or a combination thereof.
34

Organizations may choose to define specific values for security control parameters in policies, procedures, or
guidance (which may be applicable to more than one information system) referencing the source documents in the
security plan in lieu of explicitly completing the assignment/selection statements within the control as part of the plan.

35

Security controls are generally designed to be technology- and implementation-independent, and therefore do not
contain specific requirements in these areas. Organizations provide such requirements as deemed necessary in the
security plan for the information system.

greater protection than provided by the base control due to the potential adverse organizational
impacts or when organizations seek additions to the base control functionality/specificity based
on organizational assessments of risk. Security control enhancements are numbered sequentially
within each control so that the enhancements can be easily identified when selected to supplement
the base control. Each security control enhancement has a short subtitle to indicate the intended
security capability provided by the control enhancement. In the AU-3 example, if the first control
enhancement is selected, the control designation becomes AU-3(1). The numerical designation of
a control enhancement is used only to identify the particular enhancement within the control. The
designation is not indicative of either the strength of the control enhancement or any hierarchical
relationship among the enhancements. Control enhancements are not intended to be selected
independently (i.e., if a control enhancement is selected, then the corresponding base security
control must also be selected). This intent is reflected in the baseline specifications in Appendix
D and in the baseline allocation section under each control in Appendix F.
The references section includes a list of applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives,
policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines (e.g., OMB Circulars/Memoranda, Homeland
Security Presidential Directives, FIPS Publications, and NIST Special Publications) that are
relevant to a particular security control. 36 The references provide federal legislative and policy
mandates as well as supporting information for the implementation of security controls and
control enhancements. The references section also contains pertinent websites for organizations to
use in obtaining additional information for security control implementation and assessment.
The priority and security control baseline allocation section provides: (i) the recommended
priority codes used for sequencing decisions during security control implementation; and (ii) the
initial allocation of security controls and control enhancements to the baselines. Organizations
can use the priority code designation associated with each security control to assist in making
sequencing decisions for control implementation (i.e., a Priority Code 1 [P1] control has a higher
priority for implementation than a Priority Code 2 [P2] control, a Priority Code 2 [P2] control has
a higher priority for implementation than a Priority Code 3 [P3] control, and a Priority Code 0
[P0] indicates the security control is not selected in any baseline). This recommended sequencing
prioritization helps to ensure that the foundational security controls upon which other controls
depend are implemented first, thus enabling organizations to deploy controls in a more structured
and timely manner in accordance with available resources. The implementation of security
controls by sequence priority code does not imply the achievement of any defined level of risk
mitigation until all of the security controls in the security plan have been implemented. The
priority codes are intended only for implementation sequencing, not for making security control
selection decisions.

2.3 SECURITY CONTROL BASELINES
Organizations are required to adequately mitigate the risk arising from use of information and
information systems in the execution of missions and business functions. A significant challenge
for organizations is to determine the most cost-effective, appropriate set of security controls,
which if implemented and determined to be effective, would mitigate risk while complying with
security requirements defined by applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, regulations, policies,
directives, or standards (e.g., FISMA, OMB Circular A-130, HSPD-12, FIPS Publication 200).
There is no one correct set of security controls that addresses all organizational security concerns
in all situations. Selecting the most appropriate set of security controls for a specific situation or
36

Publications listed in the references section refer to the most recent versions of the publications. References are
provided to assist organizations in applying the security controls and are not intended to be inclusive or complete.

CHAPTER 2

________________________________________________________________________________________________

information system to adequately mitigate risk is an important task that requires a fundamental
understanding of organizational mission/business priorities, the mission and business functions
the information systems will support, and the environments of operation where the systems will
reside. With that understanding, organizations can demonstrate how to most effectively assure the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of organizational information and information systems
in a manner that supports mission/business needs while demonstrating due diligence. Selecting,
implementing, and maintaining an appropriate set of security controls to adequately protect the
information systems employed by organizations requires strong collaboration with system owners
to understand ongoing changes to missions/business functions, environments of operation, and
how the systems are used.
To assist organizations in making the appropriate selection of security controls for information
systems, the concept of baseline controls is introduced. Baseline controls are the starting point for
the security control selection process described in this document and are chosen based on the
security category and associated impact level of information systems determined in accordance
with FIPS Publication 199 and FIPS Publication 200, respectively. 37 Appendix D provides a
listing of the security control baselines. Three security control baselines have been identified
corresponding to the low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact information systems using
the high water mark defined in FIPS Publication 200 and used in Section 3.1 of this document to
provide an initial set of security controls for each impact level. 38
Appendix F provides a comprehensive catalog of security controls for information systems and
organizations, arranged by control families. Chapter Three provides additional information on
how to use FIPS Publication 199 security categories and FIPS Publication 200 system impact
levels in applying the tailoring guidance to the baseline security controls to achieve adequate risk
mitigation. Tailoring guidance, described in Section 3.2, helps organizations to customize the
security control baselines selected using the results from organizational assessments of risk.
Baseline tailoring actions include: (i) identifying and designating common controls; (ii) applying
scoping considerations; (iii) selecting compensating controls; (iv) assigning specific values to
security control parameters; (v) supplementing initial baselines with additional security controls
or control enhancements; and (vi) providing additional information for control implementation.

Implementation Tip
There are security controls and control enhancements that appear in the security control catalog
(Appendix F) that are found in only higher-impact baselines or are not used in any of the baselines.
These additional security controls and control enhancements for information systems are available to
organizations and can be used in tailoring security control baselines to achieve the needed level of
protection in accordance with organizational assessments of risk. The set of security controls in the
security plan must be sufficient to adequately mitigate risks to organizational operations and assets,
individuals, other organizations, and the Nation based on the organizational risk tolerance.

37

CNSS Instruction 1253 provides guidance on security control baselines for national security systems.

38

The baseline security controls contained in Appendix D are not necessarily absolutes in that the guidance described
in Section 3.2 provides organizations with the ability to tailor controls in accordance with the terms and conditions
established by their authorizing officials and documented in their respective security plans.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

2.4 SECURITY CONTROL DESIGNATIONS
There are three distinct types of designations related to the security controls in Appendix F that
define: (i) the scope of applicability for the control; (ii) the shared nature of the control; and (iii)
the responsibility for control development, implementation, assessment, and authorization. These
designations include common controls, system-specific controls, and hybrid controls.
Common controls are security controls whose implementation results in a security capability that
is inheritable by one or more organizational information systems. Security controls are deemed
inheritable by information systems or information system components when the systems or
components receive protection from the implemented controls but the controls are developed,
implemented, assessed, authorized, and monitored by entities other than those responsible for the
systems or components—entities internal or external to the organizations where the systems or
components reside. Security capabilities provided by common controls can be inherited from
many sources including, for example, organizations, organizational mission/business lines, sites,
enclaves, environments of operation, or other information systems. Many of the controls needed
to protect organizational information systems (e.g., security awareness training, incident response
plans, physical access to facilities, rules of behavior) are excellent candidates for common control
status. In addition, there can also be a variety of technology-based common controls (e.g., Public
Key Infrastructure [PKI], authorized secure standard configurations for clients/servers, access
control systems, boundary protection, cross-domain solutions). By centrally managing and
documenting the development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and monitoring of
common controls, security costs can be amortized across multiple information systems.
The organization assigns responsibility for common controls to appropriate organizational
officials (i.e., common control providers) and coordinates the development, implementation,
assessment, authorization, and monitoring of the controls. 39 The identification of common
controls is most effectively accomplished as an organization-wide exercise with the active
involvement of chief information officers, senior information security officers, the risk executive
(function), authorizing officials, information owners/stewards, information system owners, and
information system security officers. The organization-wide exercise considers the security
categories of the information systems within the organization and the security controls necessary
to adequately mitigate the risks arising from the use of those systems (see baseline security
controls in Section 2.3). 40 Common control identification for the controls that impact multiple
information systems, but not all systems across the organization could benefit from taking a
similar approach. Key stakeholders collaborate to identify opportunities to effectively employ
common controls at the mission/business line, site, or enclave level.
When common controls protect multiple organizational information systems of differing impact
levels, the controls are implemented with regard to the highest impact level among the systems. If
the common controls are not implemented at the highest impact level of the information systems,
system owners will need to factor this situation into their assessments of risk and take appropriate
risk mitigation actions (e.g., adding security controls or control enhancements, changing assigned
values of security control parameters, implementing compensating controls, or changing certain
aspects of mission/business processes). Implementing common controls that are less than
39

The Chief Information Officer, Senior Information Security Officer, or other designated organizational officials at
the senior leadership level assign responsibility for the development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and
monitoring of common controls to appropriate entities (either internal or external to the organization).
40

Each common control identified by the organization is reviewed for applicability to each specific organizational
information system, typically by information system owners and authorizing officials.

CHAPTER 2

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

effective or that provide insufficient security capability for higher-impact information systems
can have a significant adverse impact on organizational missions or business functions.
Common controls are generally documented in the organization-wide information security
program plan unless implemented as part of a specific information system, in which case the
controls are documented in the security plan for that system. 41 Organizations have the flexibility
to describe common controls in a single document or in multiple documents with references or
pointers, as appropriate. In the case of multiple documents, the documents describing common
controls are included as attachments to the information security program plan. If the information
security program plan contains multiple documents, organizations specify in each document the
organizational officials responsible for development, implementation, assessment, authorization,
and monitoring of the respective common controls. For example, the organization may require
that the Facilities Management Office develop, implement, assess, authorize, and continuously
monitor physical and environmental protection controls from the PE family when such controls
are not associated with a particular information system but instead, support multiple systems.
When common controls are included in a separate security plan for an information system (e.g.,
security controls employed as part of an intrusion detection system providing boundary protection
inherited by one or more organizational information systems), the information security program
plan indicates which separate security plan contains a description of the common controls.

Implementation Tip
The selection of common controls is most effectively accomplished on an organization-wide basis
with the involvement of senior leadership (i.e., mission/business owners, authorizing officials, chief
information officers, senior information security officers, information system owners, information
owners/stewards, risk executives). These individuals have the collective knowledge to understand
organizational priorities, the importance of organizational operations and assets, and the importance
of the information systems that support those operations/assets. The senior leaders are also in the
best position to select the common controls for each security control baseline and assign specific
responsibilities for developing, implementing, assessing, authorizing, and monitoring those controls.

Common controls, whether employed in organizational information systems or environments of
operation, are authorized by senior officials with at least the same level of authority/responsibility
for managing risk as the authorization officials for information systems inheriting the controls.
Authorization results for common controls are shared with the appropriate information system
owners and authorizing officials. A plan of action and milestones is developed and maintained for
common controls that have been determined through independent assessments, to be less than
effective. Information system owners dependent on common controls that are less than effective
consider whether they are willing to accept the associated risk or if additional tailoring is required
to address the weaknesses or deficiencies in the controls. Such risk-based decisions are influenced
by available resources, the trust models employed by the organization, and the risk tolerance of
authorizing officials and the organization. 42

41
Information security program plans are described in Appendix G. Organizations ensure that any security capabilities
provided by common controls (i.e., security capabilities inheritable by other organizational entities) are described in
sufficient detail to facilitate adequate understanding of the control implementation by inheriting entities.
42
NIST Special Publication 800-39 provides guidance on trust models, including validated, direct historical, mediated,
and mandated trust models.

CHAPTER 2

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Common controls are subject to the same assessment and monitoring requirements as systemspecific controls employed in individual organizational information systems. Because common
controls impact more than one system, a higher degree of confidence regarding the effectiveness
of those controls may be required.
Security controls not designated as common controls are considered system-specific or hybrid
controls. System-specific controls are the primary responsibility of information system owners
and their respective authorizing officials. Organizations assign a hybrid status to security controls
when one part of the control is common and another part of the control is system-specific. For
example, an organization may choose to implement the Incident Response Policy and Procedures
security control (IR-1) as a hybrid control with the policy portion of the control designated as
common and the procedures portion of the control designated as system-specific. Hybrid controls
may also serve as predefined templates for further control refinement. Organizations may choose,
for example, to implement the Contingency Planning security control (CP-2) as a predefined
template for a generalized contingency plan for all organizational information systems with
information system owners tailoring the plan, where appropriate, for system-specific uses.
Partitioning security controls into common, hybrid, and system-specific controls can result in
significant savings to organizations in implementation and assessment costs as well as a more
consistent application of security controls organization-wide. While security control partitioning
into common, hybrid, and system-specific controls is straightforward and intuitive conceptually,
the actual application takes a significant amount of planning and coordination. At the information
system level, determination of common, hybrid, or system-specific security controls follows the
development of a tailored baseline. It is necessary to first determine what security capability is
needed before organizations assign responsibility for how security controls are implemented,
operated, and maintained.
Security plans for individual information systems identify which security controls required for
those systems have been designated by organizations as common controls and which controls
have been designated as system-specific or hybrid controls. Information system owners are
responsible for any system-specific implementation details associated with common controls.
These implementation details are identified and described in the security plans for the individual
information systems. Senior information security officers for organizations coordinate with
common control providers (e.g., facility/site managers, human resources managers, intrusion
detection system owners) to ensure that the required controls are developed, implemented, and
assessed for effectiveness. Collectively, the security plans for individual information systems and
the organization-wide information security program plans provide complete coverage for all
security controls employed within organizations.
The determination as to whether a security control is a common, hybrid, or system-specific is
context-based. Security controls cannot be determined to be common, hybrid, or system-specific
simply based on reviewing the language of the control. For example, a control may be systemspecific for a particular information system, but at the same time that control could be a common
control for another system, which would inherit the control from the first system. One indicator of
whether a system-specific control may also be a common control for other information systems is
to consider who or what depends on the functionality of that particular control. If a certain part of
an information system or solution external to the system boundary depends on the control, then
that control may be a candidate for common control identification.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Implementation Tip
•

Organizations consider the inherited risk from the use of common controls. Security plans,
security assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones for common controls (or a
summary of such information) are made available to information system owners (for systems
inheriting the controls) after the information is reviewed and approved by the senior official or
executive responsible and accountable for the controls.

•

Organizations ensure that common control providers keep control status information current
since the controls typically support multiple organizational information systems. Security plans,
security assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones for common controls are used
by authorizing officials to make risk-based decisions in the security authorization process for
their information systems and therefore, inherited risk from common controls is a significant
factor in such risk-based decisions.

•

Organizations ensure that common control providers have the capability to rapidly broadcast
changes in the status of common controls that adversely affect the protections being provided by
and expected of the common controls. Common control providers inform system owners when
problems arise in the inherited common controls (e.g., when an assessment or reassessment of
a common control indicates the control is flawed or deficient in some manner, or when a new
threat or attack method arises that renders the common control less than effective in protecting
against the new threat or attack method).

•

Organizations are encouraged to employ automated management systems to maintain records
of the specific common controls employed in each organizational information system to enhance
the ability of common control providers to rapidly communicate with system owners.

•

If common controls are provided to organizations by entities external to the organization (e.g.,
shared and/or external service providers), arrangements are made with the external/shared
service providers by the organization to obtain information on the effectiveness of the deployed
controls. Information obtained from external organizations regarding effectiveness of common
controls is factored into authorization decisions.

2.5 EXTERNAL SERVICE PROVIDERS
Organizations are becoming increasingly reliant on information system services provided by
external providers to conduct important missions and business functions. External information
system services are computing and information technology services implemented outside of the
traditional security authorization boundaries established by organizations for their information
systems. Those traditional authorization boundaries linked to physical space and control of assets,
are being extended (both physically and logically) with the growing use of external services. In
this context, external services can be provided by: (i) entities within the organization but outside
of the security authorization boundaries established for organizational information systems; (ii)
entities outside of the organization either in the public sector (e.g., federal agencies) or private
sector (e.g., commercial service providers); or (iii) some combination of the public and private
sector options. External information system services include, for example, the use of serviceoriented architectures (SOAs), cloud-based services (infrastructure, platform, software), or data
center operations. External information system services may be used by, but are typically not part
of, organizational information systems. In some situations, external information system services
may completely replace or heavily augment the routine functionality of internal organizational
information systems.
FISMA and OMB policies require that federal agencies using external service providers to
process, store, or transmit federal information or operate information systems on behalf of the

CHAPTER 2

PAGE 17

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

federal government, assure that such use meets the same security requirements that federal
agencies are required to meet. Security requirements for external service providers including the
security controls for external information systems are expressed in contracts or other formal
agreements. 43 Organizations are responsible and accountable for the information security risk
incurred by the use of information system services provided by external providers. Such risk is
addressed by incorporating the Risk Management Framework (RMF) as part of the terms and
conditions of the contracts with external providers. Organizations can require external providers
to implement all steps in the RMF except the security authorization step, which remains an
inherent federal responsibility directly linked to managing the information security risk related to
the use of external information system services. 44 Organizations can also require external
providers to provide appropriate evidence to demonstrate that they have complied with the RMF
in protecting federal information. However, federal agencies take direct responsibility for the
overall security of such services by authorizing the information systems providing the services.
Relationships with external service providers are established in a variety of ways, for example,
through joint ventures, business partnerships, outsourcing arrangements (i.e., through contracts,
interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, service-level agreements), licensing
agreements, and/or supply chain exchanges. The growing use of external service providers and
new relationships being forged with those providers present new and difficult challenges for
organizations, especially in the area of information system security. These challenges include:
•

Defining the types of external information system services provided to organizations;

•

Describing how those external services are protected in accordance with the information
security requirements of organizations; and

•

Obtaining the necessary assurances that the risk to organizational operations and assets,
individuals, other organizations, and the Nation arising from the use of the external services
is acceptable.

The degree of confidence that the risk from using external services is at an acceptable level
depends on the trust that organizations place in external service providers. In some cases, the
level of trust is based on the amount of direct control organizations are able to exert on external
service providers with regard to employment of security controls necessary for the protection of
the service/information and the evidence brought forth as to the effectiveness of those controls. 45
The level of control is usually established by the terms and conditions of the contracts or servicelevel agreements with the external service providers and can range from extensive control (e.g.,
negotiating contracts or agreements that specify detailed security requirements for the providers)
to very limited control (e.g., using contracts or service-level agreements to obtain commodity

43

Organizations consult the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) when acquiring cloud
services from external providers. FedRAMP addresses required security controls and independent assessments for a
variety of cloud services. Additional information is available at http://www.fedramp.gov.
44

To effectively manage information security risk, organizations authorize information systems of external providers
that are part of the information technologies or services (e.g., infrastructure, platform, or software) provided to the
federal government. Security authorization requirements are expressed in the terms and conditions of contracts with
external providers of those information technologies and services.
45

The level of trust that organizations place in external service providers can vary widely, ranging from those who are
highly trusted (e.g., business partners in a joint venture that share a common business model and common goals) to
those who are less trusted and represent greater sources of risk (e.g., business partners in one endeavor who are also
competitors in another market sector). NIST Special Publication 800-39 describes different trust models that can be
employed by organizations when establishing relationships with external service providers.

CHAPTER 2

PAGE 18

and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

services such as commercial telecommunications services). 46 In other cases, levels of trust are
based on factors that convince organizations that required security controls have been employed
and that determinations of control effectiveness exist. For example, separately authorized external
information system services provided to organizations through well-established lines of business
relationships may provide degrees of trust in such services within the tolerable risk range of the
authorizing officials and organizations using the services.
The provision of services by external providers may result in certain services without explicit
agreements between organizations and the providers. Whenever explicit agreements are feasible
and practical (e.g., through contracts, service-level agreements), organizations develop such
agreements and require the use of the security controls in Appendix F of this publication. When
organizations are not in a position to require explicit agreements with external service providers
(e.g., services are imposed on organizations, services are commodity services), organizations
establish and document explicit assumptions about service capabilities with regard to security. In
situations where organizations are procuring information system services through centralized
acquisition vehicles (e.g., governmentwide contracts by the General Services Administration or
other preferred and/or mandatory acquisition organizations), it may be more efficient and costeffective for contract originators to establish and maintain stated levels of trust with external
service providers (including the definition of required security controls and level of assurance
with regard to the provision of such controls). Organizations subsequently acquiring information
system services from centralized contracts can take advantage of the negotiated levels of trust
established by the procurement originators and thus avoid costly repetition of activities necessary
to establish such trust. 47 Centralized acquisition vehicles (e.g., contracts) may also require the
active participation of organizations. For example, organizations may be required by provisions in
contracts or agreements to install public key encryption-enabled client software recommended by
external service providers.
Ultimately, the responsibility for adequately mitigating unacceptable risks arising from the use of
external information system services remains with authorizing officials. Organizations require
that appropriate chains of trust be established with external service providers when dealing with
the many issues associated with information system security. Organizations establish and retain a
level of trust that participating service providers in the potentially complex consumer-provider
relationship provide adequate protection for the services rendered to organizations. The chain of
trust can be complicated due to the number of entities participating in the consumer-provider
relationship and the types of relationships between the parties. External service providers may
also outsource selected services to other external entities, making the chain of trust more difficult
and complicated to manage. Depending on the nature of the services, organizations may find it
impossible to place significant trust in external providers. This situation is due not to any inherent
untrustworthiness on the part of providers, but to the intrinsic level of risk in the services. 48
46

Commercial providers of commodity-type services typically organize their business models and services around the
concept of shared resources and devices for a broad and diverse customer base. Therefore, unless organizations obtain
fully dedicated services from commercial service providers, there may be a need for greater reliance on compensating
security controls to provide the necessary protections for the information system that relies on those external services.
Organizational assessments of risk and risk mitigation activities reflect this situation.
47

For example, procurement originators could authorize information systems providing external services to the federal
government under the specific terms and conditions of the contracts. Federal agencies requesting such services under
the terms of the contracts would not be required to reauthorize the information systems when acquiring such services
(unless the request included services outside the scope of the original contracts).
48

There may also be risk in disallowing certain functionality because of security concerns. Security is merely one of
multiple considerations in an overall risk determination.

CHAPTER 2

PAGE 19

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Where a sufficient level of trust cannot be established in the external services and/or providers,
organizations can: (i) mitigate the risk by employing compensating controls; (ii) accept the risk
within the level of organizational risk tolerance; (iii) transfer risk by obtaining insurance to cover
potential losses; or (iv) avoid risk by choosing not to obtain the services from certain providers
(resulting in performance of missions/business operations with reduced levels of functionality or
possibly no functionality at all). 49 For example, in the case of cloud-based information systems
and/or services, organizations might require as a compensating control, that all information stored
in the cloud be encrypted for added security of the information. Alternatively, organizations may
require encrypting some of the information stored in the cloud (depending on the criticality or
sensitivity of such information)—accepting additional risk but limiting the risk of not storing all
information in an unencrypted form.

2.6 ASSURANCE AND TRUSTWORTHINESS
Assurance and trustworthiness of information systems, system components, and information
system services are becoming an increasingly important part of the risk management strategies
developed by organizations. Whether information systems are deployed to support, for example,
the operations of the national air traffic control system, a major financial institution, a nuclear
power plant providing electricity for a large city, or the military services and warfighters, the
systems must be reliable, trustworthy, and resilient in the face of increasingly sophisticated and
pervasive threats. To understand how organizations achieve trustworthy systems and the role
assurance plays in the trustworthiness factor, it is important to first define the term trust. Trust, in
general, is the belief that an entity will behave in a predictable manner while performing specific
functions, in specific environments, and under specified conditions or circumstances. The entity
may be a person, process, information system, system component, system-of-systems, or any
combination thereof.
From an information security perspective, trust is the belief that a security-relevant entity will
behave in a predictable manner when satisfying a defined set of security requirements under
specified conditions/circumstances and while subjected to disruptions, human errors, component
faults and failures, and purposeful attacks that may occur in the environment of operation. Trust
is usually determined relative to a specific security capability 50 and can be decided relative to an
individual system component or the entire information system. However, trust at the information
system level is not achieved as a result of composing a security capability from a set of trusted
system components—rather, trust at the system level is an inherently subjective determination
that is derived from the complex interactions among entities (i.e., technical components, physical
components, and individuals), taking into account the life cycle activities that govern, develop,
operate, and sustain the system. In essence, to have trust in a security capability requires that
there is a sufficient basis for trust, or trustworthiness, in the set of security-relevant entities that
are to be composed to provide such capability.
Trustworthiness with respect to information systems, expresses the degree to which the systems
can be expected to preserve with some degree of confidence, the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of the information that is being processed, stored, or transmitted by the systems across
a range of threats. Trustworthy information systems are systems that are believed to be capable of
operating within a defined risk tolerance despite the environmental disruptions, human errors,
49

Alternative providers offering a higher basis for trust, usually at a higher cost, may be available.

50

A security capability is a combination of mutually reinforcing security controls (i.e., safeguards/countermeasures)
implemented by technical means (i.e., functionality in hardware, software, and firmware), physical means (i.e., physical
devices and protective measures), and/or procedural means (i.e., procedures performed by individuals).

CHAPTER 2

and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

structural failures, and purposeful attacks that are expected to occur in the environments in which
the systems operate—systems that have the trustworthiness to successfully carry out assigned
missions/business functions under conditions of stress and uncertainty. 51

Security Capability
Organizations can consider defining a set of security capabilities as a precursor to the security
control selection process. The concept of security capability is a construct that recognizes that the
protection of information being processed, stored, or transmitted by information systems, seldom
derives from a single safeguard or countermeasure (i.e., security control). In most cases, such
protection results from the selection and implementation of a set of mutually reinforcing security
controls. For example, organizations may wish to define a security capability for secure remote
authentication. This capability can be achieved by the selection and implementation of a set of
security controls from Appendix F (e.g., IA-2[1], IA-2[2], IA-2[8], IA-2[9], and SC-8[1]). Moreover,
security capabilities can address a variety of areas that can include, for example, technical means,
physical means, procedural means, or any combination thereof. Thus, in addition to the above
functional capability for secure remote access, organizations may also need security capabilities that
address physical means such as tamper detection on a cryptographic module or anomaly
detection/analysis on an orbiting spacecraft.
As the number of security controls in Appendix F grows over time in response to an increasingly
sophisticated threat space, it is important for organizations to have the ability to describe key security
capabilities needed to protect core organizational missions/business functions, and to subsequently
define a set of security controls that if properly designed, developed, and implemented, produce
such capabilities. This simplifies how the protection problem is viewed conceptually. In essence,
using the construct of security capability provides a shorthand method of grouping security controls
that are employed for a common purpose or to achieve a common objective. This becomes an
important consideration, for example, when assessing security controls for effectiveness.
Traditionally, assessments have been conducted on a control-by-control basis producing results that
are characterized as pass (i.e., control satisfied) or fail (i.e., control not satisfied). However, the
failure of a single control or in some cases, the failure of multiple controls, may not affect the overall
security capability needed by an organization. Moreover, employing the broader construct of security
capability allows an organization to assess the severity of vulnerabilities discovered in its information
systems and determine if the failure of a particular security control (associated with a vulnerability) or
the decision not to deploy a certain control, affects the overall capability needed for mission/business
protection. It also facilitates conducting root cause analyses to determine if the failure of one security
control can be traced to the failure of other controls based on the established relationships among
controls. Ultimately, authorization decisions (i.e., risk acceptance decisions) are made based on the
degree to which the desired security capabilities have been effectively achieved and are meeting the
security requirements defined by an organization. These risk-based decisions are directly related to
organizational risk tolerance that is defined as part of an organization’s risk management strategy.

Two fundamental components affecting the trustworthiness of information systems are security
functionality and security assurance. Security functionality is typically defined in terms of the
security features, functions, mechanisms, services, procedures, and architectures implemented
within organizational information systems or the environments in which those systems operate.
Security assurance is the measure of confidence that the security functionality is implemented
correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the
security requirements for the system—thus possessing the capability to accurately mediate and
enforce established security policies. Security controls address both security functionality and
51
While information is the primary area of concern, trustworthiness applies to the protections for all assets deemed
critical by organizations. Furthermore, protections are provided by technology (i.e., hardware, software, firmware),
physical elements (i.e., doors, locks, surveillance), and human elements (i.e., people, processes, procedures).

security assurance. Some controls focus primarily on security functionality (e.g., PE-3, Physical
Access Control; IA-2, Identification and Authentication; SC-13, Cryptographic Protection; AC-2,
Account Management). Other controls focus primarily on security assurance (e.g., CA-2, Security
Assessment; SA-17, Developer Security Architecture and Design; CM-3, Configuration Change
Control). Finally, certain security controls can support security functionality and assurance (e.g.,
RA-5, Vulnerability Scanning; SC-3, Security Function Isolation; AC-25, Reference Monitor).
Security controls related to functionality are combined to develop a security capability with the
assurance-related controls implemented to provide a degree of confidence in the capability within
the organizational risk tolerance.
Assurance Evidence—From Developmental and Operational Activities
Organizations obtain security assurance by the actions taken by information system developers,
implementers, operators, maintainers, and assessors. Actions by individuals and/or groups during
the development/operation of information systems produce security evidence that contributes to
the assurance, or measures of confidence, in the security functionality needed to deliver the
security capability. The depth and coverage of these actions (as described in Appendix E) also
contribute to the efficacy of the evidence and measures of confidence. The evidence produced by
developers, implementers, operators, assessors, and maintainers during the system development
life cycle (e.g., design/development artifacts, assessment results, warranties, and certificates of
evaluation/validation) contributes to the understanding of the security controls implemented by
organizations.
The strength of security functionality 52 plays an important part in being able to achieve the
needed security capability and subsequently satisfying the security requirements of organizations.
Information system developers can increase the strength of security functionality by employing as
part of the hardware/software/firmware development process: (i) well-defined security policies
and policy models; (ii) structured/rigorous design and development techniques; and (iii) sound
system/security engineering principles. The artifacts generated by these development activities
(e.g., functional specifications, high-level/low-level designs, implementation representations
[source code and hardware schematics], the results from static/dynamic testing and code analysis)
can provide important evidence that the information systems (including the components that
compose those systems) will be more reliable and trustworthy. Security evidence can also be
generated from security testing conducted by independent, accredited, third-party assessment
organizations (e.g., Common Criteria Testing Laboratories, Cryptographic/Security Testing
Laboratories, and other assessment activities by government and private sector organizations).53
In addition to the evidence produced in the development environment, organizations can produce
evidence from the operational environment that contributes to the assurance of functionality and
ultimately, security capability. Operational evidence includes, for example, flaw reports, records
of remediation actions, the results of security incident reporting, and the results of organizational
continuous monitoring activities. Such evidence helps to determine the effectiveness of deployed
security controls, changes to information systems and environments of operation, and compliance
with federal legislation, policies, directives, regulations, and standards. Security evidence,
52

The security strength of an information system component (i.e., hardware, software, or firmware) is determined by
the degree to which the security functionality implemented within that component is correct, complete, resistant to
direct attacks (strength of mechanism), and resistant to bypass or tampering.
53

For example, third-party assessment organizations assess cloud services and service providers in support of the
Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). Common Criteria Testing Laboratories test and
evaluate information technology products using ISO/IEC standard 15408. Cryptographic/Security Testing Laboratories
test cryptographic modules using the FIPS 140-2 standard.

whether obtained from development or operational activities, provides a better understanding of
security controls implemented and used by organizations. Together, the actions taken during the
system development life cycle by developers, implementers, operators, maintainers, and assessors
and the evidence produced as part of those actions, help organizations to determine the extent to
which the security functionality within their information systems is implemented correctly,
operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting stated security
requirements and enforcing or mediating established security policies—thus providing greater
confidence in the security capability.

The Compelling Argument for Assurance
Organizations specify assurance-related controls to define activities performed to generate relevant
and credible evidence about the functionality and behavior of organizational information systems and
to trace the evidence to the elements that provide such functionality/behavior. This evidence is used
to obtain a degree of confidence that the systems satisfy stated security requirements—and do so
while effectively supporting the organizational missions/business functions while being subjected to
threats in the intended environments of operation.

With regard to the security evidence produced, the depth and coverage of such evidence can
affect the level of assurance in the functionality implemented. Depth and coverage are attributes
associated with assessment methods and the generation of security evidence. Assessment methods
can be applied to developmental and operational assurance. For developmental assurance, depth
is associated with the rigor, level of detail, and formality of the artifacts produced during the
design and development of the hardware, software, and firmware components of information
systems (e.g., functional specifications, high-level design, low-level design, source code). The
level of detail available in development artifacts can affect the type of testing, evaluation, and
analysis conducted during the system development life cycle (e.g., black-box testing, gray-box
testing, white-box testing, static/dynamic analysis). For operational assurance, the depth attribute
addresses the number and types of assurance-related security controls selected and implemented.
In contrast, the coverage attribute is associated with the assessment methods employed during
development and operations, addressing the scope and breadth of assessment objects included in
the assessments (e.g., number/types of tests conducted on source code, number of software
modules reviewed, number of network nodes/mobile devices scanned for vulnerabilities, number
of individuals interviewed to check basic understanding of contingency responsibilities). 54
Addressing assurance-related controls during acquisition and system development can help
organizations to obtain sufficiently trustworthy information systems and components that are
more reliable and less likely to fail. These controls include ensuring that developers employ
sound systems security engineering principles and processes including, for example, providing a
comprehensive security architecture, and enforcing strict configuration management and control
of information system and software changes. Once information systems are deployed, assurancerelated controls can help organizations to continue to have confidence in the trustworthiness of
the systems. These controls include, for example, conducting integrity checks on software and
firmware components, conducting penetration testing to find vulnerabilities in organizational

54
NIST Special Publication 800-53A provides guidance on the generation of security evidence related to security
assessments conducted during the system development life cycle.

information systems, monitoring established secure configuration settings, and developing
policies/procedures that support the operation and use of the systems.
The concepts described above, including security requirements, security capability, security
controls, security functionality, and security assurance, are brought together in a model for
trustworthiness for information systems and system components. Figure 3 illustrates the key
components in the model and the relationship among the components.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Developmental and Operational Activities to Achieve High Assurance
Raising the bar on assurance can be difficult and costly for organizations—but sometimes
essential for critical applications, missions, or business functions. Determining what parts of the
organization’s information technology infrastructure demand higher assurance of implemented
security functionality is a Tier 1/Tier 2 risk management activity (see Figure 1 in Chapter Two).
This type of activity occurs when organizations determine the security requirements necessary to
protect organizational operations (i.e., mission, functions, image, and reputation), organizational
assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Determining security requirements and
the associated security capabilities needed to generate the appropriate protection is an integral
part of the organizational risk management process described in NIST Special Publication 80039—specifically, in the development of the risk response strategy following the risk framing and
risk assessment steps (where organizations establish priorities, assumptions, constraints, risk
tolerance and assess threats, vulnerabilities, mission/business impacts, and likelihood of threat
occurrence). After the security requirements and security capabilities are determined at Tiers 1
and 2 (including the necessary assurance requirements to provide measures of confidence in the
desired capabilities), those requirements/capabilities are reflected in the design of the enterprise
architecture, the associated mission/business processes, and the organizational information
systems that are needed to support those processes. Organizations can use the Risk Management
Framework (RMF), described in NIST Special Publication 800-37, to ensure that the appropriate
assurance levels are achieved for the information systems and system components deployed to
carry out core missions and business functions. This is primarily a Tier 3 activity but can have
some overlap with Tiers 1 and 2, for example, in the area of common control selection.
Trustworthy information systems are difficult to build from a software and systems development
perspective. However, there are a number of design, architectural, and implementation principles
that, if used, can result in more trustworthy systems. These core security principles include, for
example, simplicity, modularity, layering, domain isolation, least privilege, least functionality,
and resource isolation/encapsulation. Information technology products and systems exhibiting a
higher degree of trustworthiness (i.e., products/systems having the requisite security functionality
and security assurance) are expected to exhibit a lower rate of latent design/implementation flaws
and a higher degree of penetration resistance against a range of threats including, for example,
sophisticated cyber attacks, natural disasters, accidents, and intentional/unintentional errors. 55 The
vulnerability and susceptibility of organizational missions/business functions and supporting
information systems to known threats, the environments of operation where those systems are
deployed, and the maximum acceptable level of information security risk, guide the degree of
trustworthiness needed.
Appendix E describes the minimum assurance requirements for federal information systems and
organizations and highlights the assurance-related controls in the security control baselines in
Appendix D needed to ensure that the requirements are satisfied. 56

55
Organizations also rely to a great extent on security assurance from an operational perspective as illustrated by the
assurance-related controls in Tables E-1 through E-3. Operational assurance is obtained by other than developmental
actions including for example, defining and applying security configuration settings on information technology
products, establishing policies and procedures, assessing security controls, and conducting a rigorous continuous
monitoring program. In some situations, to achieve the necessary security capability with weak or deficient information
technology, organizations compensate by increasing their operational assurance.
56
CNSS Instruction 1253 designates security control baselines for national security systems. Therefore, the assurancerelated controls in the baselines established for the national security community, if so designated, may differ from those
controls designated for non-national security systems.

CHAPTER 2

PAGE 25

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Why Assurance Matters
The importance of security assurance can be described by using the example of a light switch on a
wall in the living room of your house. Individuals can observe that by simply turning the switch on and
off, the switch appears to be performing according to its functional specification. This is analogous to
conducting black-box testing of security functionality in an information system or system component.
However, the more important questions might be—
•

Does the light switch do anything else besides what it is supposed to do?

•

What does the light switch look like from behind the wall?

•

What types of components were used to construct the light switch and how was the switch
assembled?

•

Did the switch manufacturer follow industry best practices in the development process?

This example is analogous to the many developmental activities that address the quality of the
security functionality in an information system or system component including, for example, design
principles, coding techniques, code analysis, testing, and evaluation.
The security assurance requirements and associated assurance-related controls in Appendix E
address the light switch problem from the front of the wall perspective, and potentially from the
behind the wall perspective, depending on the measure of confidence needed about the component
in question. For organizational missions/business functions that are less critical (i.e., low impact),
lower levels of assurance might be appropriate. However, as missions/business functions become
more important (i.e., moderate or high impact) and information systems and organizations become
susceptible to advanced persistent threats by high-end adversaries, increased levels of assurance
may be required. In addition, as organizations become more dependent on external information
system services and providers, assurance becomes more important—providing greater insight and
measures of confidence to organizations in understanding and verifying the security capability of
external providers and the services provided to the federal government. Thus, when the potential
impact to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation is
great, an increasing level of effort must be directed at what is happening behind the wall.

2.7 REVISIONS AND EXTENSIONS
The security controls listed in this publication represent the state-of-the-practice safeguards and
countermeasures for federal information systems and organizations. The security controls 57 will
be carefully reviewed and revised periodically to reflect:
•

Experience gained from using the controls;

•

New federal legislation, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, or policies;

•

Changing security requirements;

•

Emerging threats, vulnerabilities, and attack methods; and

•

Availability of new technologies.

The security controls in the security control catalog are expected to change over time, as controls
are withdrawn, revised, and added. The security controls defined in the low, moderate, and high
baselines are also expected to change over time as the level of security and due diligence for
mitigating risks within organizations changes. In addition to the need for change, the need for
stability is addressed by requiring that proposed modifications to security controls go through a
57

The privacy controls listed in Appendix J will also be updated on a regular basis using similar criteria.

rigorous public review process to obtain both public and private sector feedback and to build
consensus for such change. This provides over time, a stable, flexible, and technically sound set
of security controls for the federal government, contractors, and any other organizations using the
security control catalog.

CHAPTER THREE

THE PROCESS
SELECTION AND SPECIFICATION OF SECURITY CONTROLS

T

his chapter describes the process of selecting and specifying security controls and control
enhancements for organizational information systems to include: (i) selecting appropriate
security control baselines; (ii) tailoring the baselines; (iii) documenting the security control
selection process; and (iv) applying the control selection process to new development and legacy
systems.

3.1 SELECTING SECURITY CONTROL BASELINES
In preparation for selecting and specifying the appropriate security controls for organizational
information systems and their respective environments of operation, organizations first determine
the criticality and sensitivity of the information to be processed, stored, or transmitted by those
systems. This process, known as security categorization, is described in FIPS Publication 199. 58
The security categorization standard is based on a simple and well-established concept—that is,
determining the potential adverse impact for organizational information systems. The results of
security categorization help guide and inform the selection of appropriate security controls (i.e.,
safeguards and countermeasures) to adequately protect those information systems. The security
controls selected for information systems are commensurate with the potential adverse impact on
organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation if there is a
loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. FIPS Publication 199 requires organizations to
categorize information systems as low-impact, moderate-impact, or high-impact for the stated
security objectives of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (RMF Step 1). The potential
impact values assigned to the security objectives are the highest values (i.e., high water mark)
from the security categories that have been determined for each type of information processed,
stored, or transmitted by those information systems. 59 The generalized format for expressing the
security category (SC) of an information system is:
SC information system = {(confidentiality, impact), (integrity, impact), (availability, impact)},
where the acceptable values for potential impact are low, moderate, or high.

Since the potential impact values for confidentiality, integrity, and availability may not always be
the same for a particular information system, the high water mark concept (introduced in FIPS
Publication 199) is used in FIPS Publication 200 to determine the impact level of the information
system for the express purpose of selecting the applicable security control baseline from one of
the three baselines identified in Appendix D. 60 Thus, a low-impact system is defined as an
information system in which all three of the security objectives are low. A moderate-impact
system is an information system in which at least one of the security objectives is moderate and

58

CNSS Instruction 1253 provides security categorization guidance for national security systems.

59

NIST Special Publication 800-60, Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security
Categories, provides guidance on the assignment of security categories to information systems.

60
The high water mark concept is employed because there are significant dependencies among the security objectives
of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. In most cases, a compromise in one security objective ultimately affects
the other security objectives as well. Accordingly, security controls are not categorized by security objective. Rather,
the security controls are grouped into baselines to provide a general protection capability for classes of information
systems based on impact level.

CHAPTER 3

PAGE 28

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

no security objective is greater than moderate. Finally, a high-impact system is an information
system in which at least one security objective is high.

Implementation Tip
To determine the impact level of an information system:

•
•
•
•

First, determine the different types of information that are processed, stored, or transmitted by the
information system. NIST Special Publication 800-60 provides common information types.
Second, using the impact values in FIPS Publication 199 and the recommendations of NIST
Special Publication 800-60, categorize the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of each
information type.
Third, determine the information system security categorization, that is, the highest impact value
for each security objective (confidentiality, integrity, availability) from among the categorizations
for the information types associated with the information system.
Fourth, determine the overall impact level of the information system from the highest impact value
among the three security objectives in the system security categorization.

Note: For national security systems, organizations use CNSSI 1253 for security categorization.

Once the impact level of the information system is determined, organizations begin the security
control selection process (RMF Step 2). The first step in selecting and specifying security controls
for the information system is to choose the appropriate security control baseline. 61 The selection
of the security control baseline is based on the FIPS 200 impact level of the information system
as determined by the security categorization process described above. The organization selects
one of three security control baselines from Appendix D corresponding to the low-impact,
moderate-impact, or high-impact rating of the information system. 62 Note that not all security
controls are assigned to baselines, as indicated in Table D-2 by the phrase not selected. Similarly,
as illustrated in Tables D-3 through D-19, not all control enhancements are assigned to baselines.
Those control enhancements that are assigned to baselines are so indicated by an “x” in the low,
moderate, or high columns. The use of the term baseline is intentional. The security controls and
control enhancements in the baselines are a starting point from which controls/enhancements may
be removed, added, or specialized based on the tailoring guidance in Section 3.2.
The security control baselines in Appendix D address the security needs of a broad and diverse
set of constituencies (including individual users and organizations). Some assumptions that
generally underlie the baselines in Appendix D include, for example: (i) the environments in
which organizational information systems operate; (ii) the nature of operations conducted by
organizations; (iii) the functionality employed within information systems; (iv) the types of
threats facing organizations, missions/business processes, and information systems; and (v) the
type of information processed, stored, or transmitted by information systems. Articulating the
underlying assumptions is a key element in the initial risk framing step of the risk management
process described in NIST Special Publication 800-39. Some of the assumptions that underlie the
baselines in Appendix D include:

61

The general security control selection process may be augmented or further detailed by additional sector-specific
guidance as described in Section 3.3, Creating Overlays, and Appendix I, template for developing overlays.
62

CNSS Instruction 1253 provides security control baselines for national security systems.

CHAPTER 3

PAGE 29

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

•

Information systems are located in physical facilities;

•

User data/information in organizational information systems is relatively persistent; 63

•

Information systems are multi-user (either serially or concurrently) in operation;

•

Some user data/information in organizational information systems is not shareable with other
users who have authorized access to the same systems;

•

Information systems exist in networked environments;

•

Information systems are general purpose in nature; and

•

Organizations have the necessary structure, resources, and infrastructure to implement the
controls. 64

If one or more of these assumptions is not valid, then some of the security controls assigned to the
initial baselines in Appendix D may not be applicable—a situation that can be readily addressed
by applying the tailoring guidance in Section 3.2 and the results of organizational assessments of
risk. Conversely, there are also some possible situations that are specifically not addressed in the
baselines. These include:
•

Insider threats exist within organizations;

•

Classified data/information is processed, stored, or transmitted by information systems;

•

Advanced persistent threats (APTs) exist within organizations;

•

Selected data/information requires specialized protection based on federal legislation,
directives, regulations, or policies; and

•

Information systems need to communicate with other systems across different security
domains.

If any of the above assumptions apply, then additional security controls from Appendix F would
likely be needed to ensure adequate protection—a situation that can also be effectively addressed
by applying the tailoring guidance in Section 3.2 (specifically, security control supplementation)
and the results of organizational assessments of risk.

3.2 TAILORING BASELINE SECURITY CONTROLS
After selecting the applicable security control baseline from Appendix D, organizations initiate
the tailoring process to modify appropriately and align the controls more closely with the specific
conditions within the organization (i.e., conditions related to organizational missions/business
functions, information systems, or environments of operation). The tailoring process includes:
•

Identifying and designating common controls in initial security control baselines;

•

Applying scoping considerations to the remaining baseline security controls;

•

Selecting compensating security controls, if needed;

63

Persistent data/information refers to data/information with utility for a relatively long duration (e.g., days, weeks).

64

In general, federal departments and agencies will satisfy this assumption. The assumption becomes more of an issue
for nonfederal entities such as municipalities, first responders, and small (business) contractors. Such entities may not
be large enough or sufficiently resourced to have elements dedicated to providing the range of security capabilities that
are assumed by the baselines. Organizations consider such factors in their risk-based decisions.

CHAPTER 3

________________________________________________________________________________________________

•

Assigning specific values to organization-defined security control parameters via explicit
assignment and selection statements;

•

Supplementing baselines with additional security controls and control enhancements, if
needed; and

•

Providing additional specification information for control implementation, if needed.

The tailoring process, as an integral part of security control selection and specification, is part of a
comprehensive organizational risk management process—framing, assessing, responding to, and
monitoring information security risk. Organizations use risk management guidance to facilitate
risk-based decision making regarding the applicability of security controls in the security control
baselines. Ultimately, organizations use the tailoring process to achieve cost-effective, risk-based
security that supports organizational mission/business needs. Tailoring activities are approved by
authorizing officials in coordination with selected organizational officials (e.g., risk executive
[function], chief information officers, senior information security officers, information system
owners, common control providers) prior to implementing the security controls. Organizations
have the flexibility to perform the tailoring process at the organization level for all information
systems (either as a required tailored baseline or as the starting point for system-specific tailoring
activities), in support of a particular line of business or mission/business process, at the individual
information system level, or by using a combination of the above. 65
Conversely, organizations do not remove security controls for operational convenience. Tailoring
decisions regarding security controls should be defensible based on mission/business needs and
accompanied by explicit risk-based determinations. 66 Tailoring decisions, including the specific
rationale for those decisions, are documented in the security plans for organizational information
systems. Every security control from the applicable security control baseline is accounted for
either by the organization (e.g., common control provider) or by the information system owner. If
certain security controls are tailored out, then the associated rationale is recorded in security plans
(or references/pointers to other relevant documentation are provided) for the information systems
and approved by the responsible organizational officials as part of the security plan approval
process. 67
Documenting significant risk management decisions in the security control selection process is
imperative in order for authorizing officials to have the necessary information to make credible,
risk-based decisions with regard to the authorization of information systems. Since information
systems, environments of operation, and personnel associated with the system development life
cycle are subject to change, providing the assumptions, constraints, and rationale supporting those
important risk decisions allows for a better understanding in the future of the security state of the
information systems or environments of operation at the time the original risk decisions were
made and facilitates identifying changes, when previous risk decisions are revisited.

65

See also Section 3.3, Creating Overlays, and Appendix I, template for developing overlays.

66

Tailoring decisions can also be based on timing and applicability of selected security controls under certain defined
conditions. That is, security controls may not apply in every situation or the parameter values for assignment statements
may change under certain circumstances. Overlays can define these special situations, conditions, or timing-related
considerations.
67

The level of detail required in documenting tailoring decisions in the security control selection process is at the
discretion of organizations and reflects the impact levels of the respective information systems implementing or
inheriting the controls.

CHAPTER 3

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Identifying and Designating Common Controls
Common controls are controls that may be inherited by one or more organizational information
systems. If an information system inherits a common control, then that system does not need to
explicitly implement that control—that is, the security capability is being provided by another
entity. Therefore, when the security controls in Appendix F call for an information system to
implement or perform a particular security function, it should not be interpreted to mean that all
systems that are part of larger, more complex systems or all components of a particular system
need to implement the control or function. Organizational decisions on which security controls
are designated as common controls may greatly affect the responsibilities of individual system
owners with regard to the implementation of controls in a particular baseline. Common control
selection can also affect the overall resource expenditures by organizations (i.e., the greater the
number of common controls implemented, the greater potential cost savings).
Applying Scoping Considerations
Scoping considerations, when applied in conjunction with risk management guidance, provide
organizations with a more granular foundation with which to make risk-based decisions. 68 The
application of scoping considerations can eliminate unnecessary security controls from the initial
security control baselines and help to ensure that organizations select only those controls that are
needed to provide the appropriate level of protection for organizational information systems—
protection based on the missions and business functions being supported by those systems and the
environments in which the systems operate. Organizations may apply the scoping considerations
described below to assist with making risk-based decisions regarding security control selection
and specification—decisions that can potentially affect how the baseline security controls are
applied and implemented by organizations:
•

CONTROL ALLOCATION AND PLACEMENT CONSIDERATIONS—

The term information system can refer to systems at multiple levels of abstraction ranging
from system-of-systems to individual single-user systems. The growing complexity of many
information systems requires careful analysis in the allocation/placement of security controls
within the three tiers in the risk management hierarchy (organization level, mission/business
process level, and information system level) without imposing any specific architectural
views or solutions. 69 Security controls in the initial baselines represent an information
system-wide set of controls that may not be applicable to every component in the system.
Security controls are applicable only to information system components that provide or
support the information security capability addressed by the controls.70 Organizations make
explicit risk-based decisions about where to apply or allocate specific security controls in
organizational information systems in order to achieve the needed security capability and to
satisfy security requirements. 71 An example of this type of allocation is applying the
68

The scoping considerations listed in this section are exemplary and not intended to limit organizations in rendering
risk-based decisions based on other organization-defined considerations with appropriate rationale.
69
This is especially true with the advent of service-oriented architectures where specific services are provided to
implement a single function.
70

For example, auditing controls are typically applied to components of an information system that provide auditing
capability (e.g., servers, etc.) and are not necessarily applied to every user-level workstation within the organization.
Organizations should carefully assess the inventory of components that compose their information systems to
determine which security controls are applicable to the various components.
71

As information technology advances, more powerful and diverse functionality can be found in smart phones, tablets,
and other types of mobile devices. While tailor guidance may support not allocating a particular security control to a
specific technology or device, any residual risk associated with the absence of that control must be addressed in risk
assessments to adequately protect organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.

requirement from AC-18(1) (i.e., protecting wireless access to information systems using
authentication/encryption) to all wireless access except for wireless access to visitor
subnetworks which are not connected to other system components.
•

OPERATIONAL/ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED CONSIDERATIONS—

Several of the security controls in the baselines are based on the assumption of the existence
of certain operational/environmental factors. Where these factors are absent or significantly
diverge from the baseline assumptions, it is justifiable to tailor the baseline. Some of the more
common operational/environmental factors include:
-

Mobility
The mobility of physical hosting environments can impact the security controls selected
for organizational information systems. As noted above, the set of security controls
assigned to each baseline in Appendix D assumes the operation of information systems in
fixed facilities and nonmobile locations. If those information systems operate primarily in
mobile environments, the security control baseline should be tailored appropriately to
account for the differences in mobility and accessibility of the specific locations where
the systems reside. For example, many of the security controls in the Physical and
Environmental Protection (PE) family that are selected in all three baselines reflect the
assumption that the information systems reside in physical facilities/complexes that
require appropriate physical protections. Such controls would likely not provide added
value for mobile environments such as ships, aircraft, automobiles, vans, or space-based
systems. 72

-

Single-User Systems and Operations
For information systems that are designed to operate as single-user systems (e.g., smart
phones), several of the security controls that address sharing among users may not be
needed. A single-user system or device refers to a system/device that is only intended to
be used by a single individual over time (i.e., exclusive use). Systems or devices that are
shared by multiple users over time are not considered single-user. Security controls such
as AC-10, Concurrent Session Control, SC-4, Information in Shared Resources, and AC3, Access Enforcement 73 may not be required in single-user systems/operations and could
reasonably be tailored out of the baseline at the discretion of organizations.

-

Data Connectivity and Bandwidth
While many information systems are interconnected, there are some systems which for
security or operational reasons, lack networking capabilities—that is, the systems are air
gapped from the network. For nonnetworked systems, security controls such as AC-17,
Remote Access, SC-8, Transmission Confidentiality and Integrity, and SC-7, Boundary
Protection, are not applicable and may be tailored out of the security control baselines at
the discretion of organizations. In addition to nonnetworked information systems, there
are systems that have very limited or sporadic bandwidth (e.g., tactical systems that
support warfighter or law enforcement missions). For such systems, the application of
security controls would need to be examined carefully as the limited and/or sporadic
bandwidth could impact the practicality of implementing those controls and the viability
of adversaries staging cyber attacks over the limited bandwidth.

72
The mobile nature of devices means that it is possible that, for some period of time, the devices may reside in fixed
facilities or complexes in fixed locations. During that time, the PE controls would likely apply.
73

Organizations consider whether individual users have administrator privileges before removing AC-3 from security
control baselines.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

-

Limited Functionality Systems or System Components
What constitutes an information system under the E-Government Act of 2002 is quite
broad. Fax machines, printers, scanners, pagers, smart phones, tablets, E-readers, and
digital cameras can all be categorized as information systems (or system components).
These types of systems and components may lack the general processing capabilities
assumed in the security control baselines. The nature of these constraints may limit the
types of threats that these systems face, and hence the appropriateness of some of the
security controls. Thus, a control such as SI-3, Malicious Code Protection (required in all
control baselines) may not be practical for information systems or components that are
not capable of executing code (e.g., text-only pagers). However, because there is often no
clear delineation between these types of information systems or components (e.g., smart
phones combine the digital capabilities of telephones, cameras, and computers), it is
important that the application of security controls to limited functionality systems or
components be done judiciously and always take into account the intended use of the
systems, system capabilities, and the risk of compromise.

-

Information and System Non-Persistence
There is often an assumption that user information within organizational information
systems is persistent for a considerable period of time. However, for some applications
and environments of operation (e.g., tactical systems, industrial control systems), the
persistence of user information is often very limited in duration. For information systems
processing, storing, or transmitting such non-persistent information, several security
controls in the Contingency Planning (CP) family such as CP-6, Alternate Storage Site,
CP-7, Alternate Processing Site, and CP-9, Information System Backup, may not be
practical and can be tailored out at the discretion of organizations. For similar reasons,
controls such as MP-6, Media Sanitization, and SC-28, Protection of Information at Rest,
are good candidates for removal through tailoring. 74 In addition to the non-persistence of
information, the information systems/services may be non-persistent as well. This can be
achieved by the use of virtualization techniques to establish non-persistent instantiations
of operating systems and applications. Depending on the duration of the instantiations,
some baseline controls might not be applicable.

-

Public Access
When public access to organizational information systems is allowed, security controls
should be applied with discretion since some security controls from the specified control
baselines (e.g., identification and authentication, personnel security controls) may not be
applicable for public access. Thus, in the case of the general public accessing federal
government websites (e.g., to download publically accessible information such as forms,
emergency preparedness information), security controls such as AC-7, Unsuccessful
Logon Attempts, AC-17, Remote Access, IA-2, Identification and Authentication, IA-4,
Identifier Management, and IA-5, Authenticator Management, typically would not be
relevant for validating access authorizations or privileges. However, many of these
controls would still be needed for identifying and authenticating organizational personnel
that maintain and support information systems providing such public access websites and
services. Similarly, many of the security controls may still be required for users accessing
nonpublic information systems through such public interfaces, for example, to access or
change personal information.

74
Organizations balance information persistence with the sensitivity of the information. Non-persistent information
may still require sanitization after deletion. In addition, organizations consider the duration of information sensitivity—
some information may be persistent, but only be sensitive for a limited time.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

•

SECURITY OBJECTIVE-RELATED CONSIDERATIONS—

Security controls that support only one or two of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability
security objectives may be downgraded to the corresponding control in a lower baseline (or
modified or eliminated if not defined in a lower baseline) only if the downgrading action: (i)
reflects the FIPS Publication 199 security category for the supported security objective(s)
before moving to the FIPS Publication 200 impact level (i.e., high water mark); 75 (ii) is
supported by an organizational assessment of risk; and (iii) does not adversely affect the level
of protection for the security-relevant information within the information system. 76 For
example, if an information system is categorized as moderate impact using the high water
mark concept because confidentiality and/or integrity are moderate but availability is low,
there are several controls that only support the availability security objective and that
potentially could be downgraded to low baseline requirements—that is, it may be appropriate
not to implement CP-2(1) because the control enhancement supports only availability and is
selected in the moderate baseline but not in the low baseline. The following security controls
and control enhancements are potential candidates for downgrading: 77

•

-

Confidentiality: AC-21, MA-3(3), MP-3, MP-4, MP-5, MP-5(4), MP-6(1), MP-6(2), PE4, PE-5, SC-4, SC-8, SC-8(1);

-

Integrity: CM-5, CM-5(1), CM-5(3), SC-8, SC-8(1), SI-7, SI-7(1), SI-7(5), SI-10; and

-

Availability: CP-2(1), CP-2(2), CP-2(3), CP-2(4), CP-2(5), CP-2(8), CP-3(1), CP-4(1),
CP-4(2), CP-6, CP-6(1), CP-6(2), CP-6(3), CP-7, CP-7(1), CP-7(2), CP-7(3), CP-7(4),
CP-8, CP-8(1), CP-8(2), CP-8(3), CP-8(4), CP-9(1), CP-9(2), CP-9(3), CP-9(5), CP10(2), CP-10(4), MA-6, PE-9, PE-10, PE-11, PE-11(1), PE-13(1), PE-13(2), PE-13(3),
PE-15(1).

TECHNOLOGY-RELATED CONSIDERATIONS—

Security controls that refer to specific technologies (e.g., wireless, cryptography, public key
infrastructure) are applicable only if those technologies are employed or are required to be
employed within organizational information systems. Security controls that can be explicitly
or implicitly supported by automated mechanisms do not require the development of such
mechanisms if the mechanisms do not already exist or are not readily available in commercial
or government off-the-shelf products. If automated mechanisms are not readily available,
75
When applying the high water mark in Section 3.1, some of the original FIPS Publication 199 confidentiality,
integrity, or availability security objectives may have been upgraded to a higher security control baseline. As part of
this process, security controls that uniquely support the confidentiality, integrity, or availability security objectives may
have been upgraded unnecessarily. Consequently, it is recommended that organizations consider appropriate and
allowable downgrading actions to ensure cost-effective, risk-based application of security controls.
76

Information that is security-relevant at the information system level (e.g., password files, network routing tables,
cryptographic key management information) is distinguished from user-level information within the same system.
Certain security controls are used to support the security objectives of confidentiality and integrity for both user-level
and system-level information. Caution should be exercised in downgrading confidentiality or integrity-related security
controls to ensure that downgrading actions do not result in insufficient protection for the security-relevant information
within the information system. Security-relevant information must be protected at the high water mark in order to
achieve a similar level of protection for any of the security objectives related to user-level information.
77

Downgrading actions apply only to the moderate and high baselines. Security controls that are uniquely attributable
to confidentiality, integrity, or availability that would ordinarily be considered as potential candidates for downgrading
(e.g., AC-16, AU-10, IA-7, PE-12, PE-14, SC-5, SC-13, SC-16) are eliminated from consideration because the controls
are either selected for use in all baselines and have no enhancements that could be downgraded, or the controls are
optional and not selected for use in any baseline. Organizations should exercise caution when downgrading security
controls that do not appear in the list in Section 3.2 to ensure that downgrading actions do not affect security objectives
other than the objectives targeted for downgrading.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

cost-effective, or technically feasible, compensating security controls, implemented through
nonautomated mechanisms or procedures, are used to satisfy specified security controls or
control enhancements (see terms and conditions for applying compensating controls below).
•

MISSION REQUIREMENTS-RELATED CONSIDERATIONS—

Some security controls may not be applicable (or appropriate) if implementing those controls
has the potential to degrade, debilitate, or otherwise hamper critical organizational missions
and/or business functions. For example, if the mission requires that an uninterrupted display
of mission-critical information be available at an operator console (e.g., air traffic controller
console), the implementation of AC-11, Session Lock, or SC-10, Network Disconnect, may
not be appropriate.
Selecting Compensating Security Controls
Organizations may find it necessary on occasion to employ compensating security controls.
Compensating controls are alternative security controls employed by organizations in lieu of
specific controls in the low, moderate, or high baselines described in Appendix D—controls that
provide equivalent or comparable protection for organizational information systems and the
information processed, stored, or transmitted by those systems. 78 This may occur, for example,
when organizations are unable to effectively implement specific security controls in the baselines
or when, due to the specific nature of the information systems or environments of operation, the
controls in the baselines are not a cost-effective means of obtaining the needed risk mitigation.
Compensating controls are typically selected after applying the scoping considerations in the
tailoring guidance to the applicable security control baseline. Compensating controls may be
employed by organizations under the following conditions:
•
•

•

Organizations select compensating controls from Appendix F; if appropriate compensating
controls are not available, organizations adopt suitable compensating controls from other
sources; 79
Organizations provide supporting rationale for how compensating controls provide equivalent
security capabilities for organizational information systems and why the baseline security
controls could not be employed; and
Organizations assess and accept the risk associated with implementing compensating controls
in organizational information systems.

Assigning Security Control Parameter Values
Security controls and control enhancements containing embedded parameters (i.e., assignment
and selection statements) give organizations the flexibility to define certain portions of controls
and enhancements to support specific organizational requirements. After the initial application of
scoping considerations and the selection of compensating controls, organizations review the
security controls and control enhancements for assignment/selection statements and determine
appropriate organization-defined values for the identified parameters. Parameter values may be
prescribed by applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, or
standards. Once organizations define the parameter values for security controls and control
78

More than one compensating control may be required to provide the equivalent protection for a particular security
control in Appendix F. For example, organizations with significant staff limitations may compensate for the separation
of duty security control by strengthening the audit, accountability, and personnel security controls.
79

Organizations should make every attempt to select compensating controls from the security control catalog in
Appendix F. Organization-defined compensating controls are employed only when organizations determine that the
security control catalog does not contain suitable compensating controls.

CHAPTER 3

PAGE 36

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

enhancements, the assignments and selections become a part of the control and enhancement. 80
Organizations may choose to specify the values for security control parameters before selecting
compensating controls since the specification of the parameters completes the control definitions
and may affect compensating control requirements. There can also be significant benefits in
collaborating on the development of parameter values. For organizations that work together on a
frequent basis, it may be useful for those organizations to develop a mutually agreeable set of
uniform values for security control parameters. Doing so may assist organizations in achieving a
greater degree of reciprocity when depending upon the information systems and/or services
offered by other organizations.
Supplementing Security Control Baselines
The final determination of the appropriate set of security controls necessary to provide adequate
security for organizational information systems and the environments in which those systems
operate is a function of the assessment of risk and what is required to sufficiently mitigate the
risks to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. 81
In many cases, additional security controls or control enhancements (beyond those controls and
enhancements contained in the baselines in Appendix D) will be required to address specific
threats to and vulnerabilities in organizations, mission/business processes, and/or information
systems and to satisfy the requirements of applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives,
policies, standards, or regulations. 82 The risk assessment in the security control selection process
provides essential information in determining the necessity and sufficiency of the security
controls and control enhancements in the initial baselines. Organizations are encouraged to make
maximum use of Appendix F to facilitate the process of supplementing the initial baselines with
additional security controls and/or control enhancements. 83
Situations Requiring Potential Baseline Supplementation
Organizations may be subject to conditions that, from an operational, environmental, or threat
perspective, warrant the selection and implementation of additional (supplemental) controls to
achieve adequate protection of organizational missions/business functions and the information
systems supporting those missions/functions. Examples of conditions and additional controls that
might be required are provided below.
•

ADVANCED PERSISTENT THREAT

Security control baselines do not assume that the current threat environment is one where
adversaries have achieved a significant foothold and presence within organizations and
organizational information systems—that is, organizations are dealing with an advanced
persistent threat (APT). Adversaries continue to attack organizational information systems
and the information technology infrastructure and are successful in some aspects of such
attacks. To more fully address the advanced persistent threat, concepts such as insider threat
80

CNSS Instruction 1253 provides assignment of minimum values for organization-defined variables applicable to
national security systems. Parameter values can also be defined as part of overlays described in Section 3.4.
81
Considerations for potential national-level impacts and impacts to other organizations in categorizing organizational
information systems derive from the USA PATRIOT Act and Homeland Security Presidential Directives.
82
In previous versions of Special Publication 800-53, tailoring referred only to the removal of security controls from
baselines and supplementation referred only to the addition of controls to baselines. In this document, the term tailoring
has been redefined to include both the addition of security controls to baselines (i.e., tailoring up) and the removal of
controls from baselines (i.e., tailoring down).
83

Security controls and control enhancements selected to supplement baselines are allocated to appropriate information
system components in the same manner as the control allocations carried out by organizations in the initial baselines.

CHAPTER 3

and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

protection (CM-5(4)), heterogeneity (SC-29), deception (SC-26 and SC-30), non-persistence
(SC-25 and SC-34), and segmentation (SC-7(13)) can be considered.
•

CROSS-DOMAIN SERVICES

Security control baselines do not assume that information systems have to operate across
multiple security domains. The baselines assume a flat view of information flows (i.e., the
same security policies in different domains when information moves across authorization
boundaries). To address cross-domain services and transactions, some subset of the AC-4
security control enhancements can be considered to ensure adequate protection of information
when transferred between information systems with different security policies.
•

MOBILITY

The use of mobile devices might result in the need for additional security controls and control
enhancements not selected in the initial baselines. For example, AC-7(2), which requires the
purging/wiping of information after an organization-defined number of unsuccessful logon
attempts, or MP-6 (8), which requires the capability for remote purging/wiping, could be
selected in order to address the threat of theft or loss of mobile devices.
•

CLASSIFIED INFORMATION

In some environments, classified and sensitive information 84 may be resident on national
security systems without all users having the necessary authorizations to access all of the
information. In those situations, additional security controls are required to ensure that
information requiring strict separation is not accessed by unauthorized users. More stringent
access controls include, for example, AC-3(3) and AC-16. When classified information is
being processed, stored, or transmitted on information systems that are jointly owned by
multiple entities (e.g., coalition partners in military alliances), more restrictive controls for
maintenance personnel may be required including, for example, MA-5(4).
Processes for Identifying Additional Needed Security Controls
Organizations can employ a requirements definition approach or a gap analysis approach in
selecting security controls and control enhancements to supplement initial baselines. In the
requirements definition approach, organizations obtain specific and credible threat 85 information
(or make reasonable assumptions) about the activities of adversaries with certain capabilities or
attack potential (e.g., skill levels, expertise, available resources). To effectively withstand cyber
attacks from adversaries with the stated capabilities or attack potential, organizations strive to
achieve a certain level of defensive capability or cyber preparedness. Organizations can select
additional security controls and control enhancements from Appendix F to obtain such defensive
capability or level of preparedness. In contrast to the requirements definition approach, the gap
analysis approach begins with an organizational assessment of its current defensive capability or
level of cyber preparedness. From that initial capability assessment, organizations determine the
types of threats they can reasonably expect to counter. If the current organizational defensive
capabilities or levels of cyber preparedness are insufficient, the gap analysis determines the
required capabilities and levels of preparedness. Organizations subsequently define the security
controls and control enhancements from Appendix F needed to achieve the desired capabilities or
cyber-preparedness levels. Both of the approaches described above require timely and accurate

84

The example is illustrative only. CNSS Instruction 1253 provides specific guidance regarding security controls
required for national security systems.
85
While this example focuses on threats to information systems from purposeful attacks, the threat space of concern to
organizations also includes environmental disruptions and human errors.

CHAPTER 3

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

threat information. It is essential that organizations work with the appropriate threat identification
component to obtain such information.
During the tailoring process, organizations consider reevaluating the priority codes from the
security control baselines to determine if any changes to those priorities are appropriate. This is
especially important when adding security controls that are not included in any of the baselines,
because those controls have priority codes of P0. The reevaluation of priority codes can be based
on organizational assessments of risk or design/developmental decisions related to the security
architecture or the systems and security engineering process that may require certain sequencing
in security control implementation.
Enhancing Information Security without Changing Control Selection
There may be situations in which organizations cannot apply sufficient security controls within
their information systems to adequately reduce or mitigate risk (e.g., when using certain types of
information technologies or employing certain computing paradigms). Therefore, alternative
strategies are needed to prevent organizational missions/business functions from being adversely
affected— strategies that consider the mission and business risks resulting from an aggressive use
of information technology. Restrictions on the types of technologies used and how organizational
information systems are employed provide an alternative method to reduce or mitigate risk that
may be used in conjunction with, or instead of, supplemental security controls. Restrictions on the
use of information systems and specific information technologies may be, in some situations, the
only practical or reasonable actions organizations can take in order to have the capability to carry
out assigned missions/business functions in the face of determined adversaries. Examples of use
restrictions include:
•

Limiting the information that information systems can process, store, or transmit or the
manner in which organizational missions/business functions are automated;

•

Prohibiting external access to organizational information by removing selected information
system components from networks (i.e., air gapping); and

•

Prohibiting moderate- or high-impact information on organizational information system
components to which the public has access, unless an explicit risk determination is made
authorizing such access.

Providing Additional Specification Information for Control Implementation
Since security controls are statements of security capability at higher levels of abstraction, the
controls may lack sufficient information for successful implementation. Therefore, additional
detail may be necessary to fully define the intent of a given security control for implementation
purposes and to ensure that the security requirements related to that control are satisfied. For
example, additional information may be provided as part of the process of moving from control to
specification requirement, and may involve refinement of implementation details, refinement of
scope, or iteration to apply the same control differently to different scopes. Organizations ensure
that if existing security control information (e.g., selection and assignment statements) is not
sufficient to fully define the intended application of the control, such information is provided.
Organizations have the flexibility to determine whether additional detail is included as a part of
the control statement, in supplemental guidance, or in a separate control addendum section. When
providing additional detail, organizations are cautioned not to change the intent of the security
control or modify the original language in the control. The additional implementation information
can be documented either in security plans or systems and security engineering plans. The type of

CHAPTER 3

PAGE 39

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

additional detail that might be necessary to fully specify a security control for implementation
purposes is provided in the SI-7(6) example below:
SI-7

SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY
(6)

SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION

The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to detect unauthorized changes to
software, firmware, and information.
Supplemental Guidance: Cryptographic mechanisms used for the protection of integrity include,
for example, digital signatures and the computation and application of signed hashes using
asymmetric cryptography, protecting the confidentiality of the key used to generate the hash,
and using the public key to verify the hash information. Related control: SC-13.

Additional implementation detail for SI-7(6):
Digital signatures are applied to all traffic for which non-repudiation is required employing
SHA-256 or another approved NIST algorithm demonstrably of at least the same strength of
mechanism.

3.3 CREATING OVERLAYS
The previous sections described the process of tailoring security control baselines to achieve a
more focused and relevant security capability for organizations. In certain situations, it may be
beneficial for organizations to apply tailoring guidance to the baselines to develop a set of
security controls for community-wide use or to address specialized requirements, technologies, or
unique missions/environments of operation. 86 For example, the federal government may decide to
establish a governmentwide set of security controls and implementation guidance for: (i) public
key infrastructure (PKI) systems that could be uniformly applied to all PKI systems implemented
within federal agencies; (ii) cloud-based information systems that are uniformly applied to all
federal agencies procuring or implementing cloud services; or (iii) industrial control systems
(ICSs) at federal facilities producing electric power or controlling environmental systems in
federal facilities. Alternatively, to address particular communities of interest with specialized
requirements, the Department of Defense, for example, may decide to establish a set of security
controls and implementation guidance for its tactical operations and environments by applying
the tailoring guidance to the standard security control baselines for national security systems to
achieve more specialized solutions. In each of the above examples, tailored baselines can be
developed for each information technology area or for the unique circumstances/environments
and promulgated to large communities of interest—thus achieving standardized security
capabilities, consistency of implementation, and cost-effective security solutions.
To address the need for developing community-wide and specialized sets of security controls for
information systems and organizations, the concept of overlay is introduced. An overlay is a fully
specified set of security controls, control enhancements, and supplemental guidance derived from
the application of tailoring guidance in Section 3.2 to security control baselines in Appendix D. 87
Overlays complement the initial security control baselines by: (i) providing the opportunity to add
or eliminate controls; (ii) providing security control applicability and interpretations for specific
information technologies, computing paradigms, environments of operation, types of information
systems, types of missions/operations, operating modes, industry sectors, and statutory/regulatory
requirements; (iii) establishing community-wide parameter values for assignment and/or selection
statements in security controls and control enhancements; and (iv) extending the supplemental
guidance for security controls, where necessary. Organizations typically use the overlay concept
86

This type of tailoring can be conducted at the federal level or by individual organizations.

87

CNSS Instruction 1253 provides tailoring guidance and security control baselines for national security systems.

CHAPTER 3

PAGE 40

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

when there is divergence from the basic assumptions used to create the initial security control
baselines (see Section 3.1). If organizations are not divergent from the basic assumptions for the
initial baselines, there is likely no need to create an overlay. Alternatively, the baselines may be
missing key assumptions which would justify creating an overlay with additional assumptions.
The full range of tailoring activities can be employed by organizations to provide a disciplined
and structured approach for developing tailored baselines supporting the areas described above.
Overlays provide an opportunity to build consensus across communities of interest and develop
security plans for organizational information systems that have broad-based support for very
specific circumstances, situations, and/or conditions. Categories of overlays that may be useful
include, for example:
•

Communities of interest, industry sectors, or coalitions/partnerships (e.g., healthcare, law
enforcement, intelligence, financial, transportation, energy, allied collaboration/sharing);

•

Information technologies/computing paradigms (e.g., cloud/mobile, PKI, Smart Grid, crossdomain solutions);

•

Environments of operation (e.g., space, tactical);

•

Types of information systems and operating modes (e.g., industrial/process control systems,
weapons systems, single-user systems, standalone systems);

•

Types of missions/operations (e.g., counterterrorism, first responders, research, development,
test, and evaluation); and

•

Statutory/regulatory requirements (e.g., Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, Privacy Act).

Organizations can effectively use the risk management concepts defined in NIST Special
Publication 800-39 when developing overlays. The successful development of overlays requires
the involvement of: (i) information security professionals who understand the specific subject
area that is the focus of the overlay development effort; and (ii) subject matter experts in the
overlay area who understand the security controls in Appendix F and the initial baselines in
Appendix D. The format and structure for developing overlays is provided in Appendix I.
Multiple overlays can be applied to a single security control baseline. The tailored baselines that
result from the overlay development process may be more or less stringent than the original
security control baselines. Risk assessments provide information necessary to determine if the
risk from implementing the tailored baselines falls within the risk tolerance of the organizations
or communities of interest developing the overlays. If multiple overlays are employed, it is
possible that there could be a conflict between the overlays. If the use of multiple overlays results
in conflicts between the application or removal of security controls, the authorizing official (or
designee), in coordination with the mission/business owner and/or information owner/steward,
can resolve the conflict. In general, overlays are intended to reduce the need for ad hoc tailoring
of baselines by organizations through the selection of a set of controls and control enhancements
that more closely correspond to common circumstances, situations, and/or conditions. However,
the use of overlays does not preclude organizations from performing further tailoring to reflect
organization-specific needs, assumptions, or constraints. Tailoring of overlays is accomplished
within the constraints defined within the overlay and may require the concurrence/approval of the
authorizing official or other organization-designated individuals. For example, an overlay created
for an industrial control system (ICS) may require tailoring for applicability to a specific type of
ICS and its environment of operation. But it is anticipated that the use of overlays would greatly
reduce the number and extent of organization-specific ad hoc tailoring.

3.4 DOCUMENTING THE CONTROL SELECTION PROCESS
Organizations document the relevant decisions taken during the security control selection process,
providing a sound rationale for those decisions. This documentation is essential when examining
the security considerations for organizational information systems with respect to the potential
mission/business impact. The resulting set of security controls and the supporting rationale for the
selection decisions (including any information system use restrictions required by organizations)
are documented in the security plans. Documenting significant risk management decisions in the
security control selection process is imperative so that authorizing officials can have access to the
necessary information to make informed authorization decisions for organizational information
systems. 88 Without such information, the understanding, assumptions, constraints, and rationale
supporting those risk management decisions will, in all likelihood, not be available when the state
of the information systems or environments of operation change, and the original risk decisions
are revisited. Figure 4 summarizes the security control selection process, including the selection
of initial baselines and the tailoring of the baselines by applying the guidance in Section 3.2.

FIGURE 4: SECURITY CONTROL SELECTION PROCESS

Iterative and Dynamic Nature of Security Control Tailoring
The security control tailoring process described above, while appearing to be sequential in nature,
can also have an iterative aspect. Organizations may choose to execute the tailoring steps in any
order based on organizational needs and the information generated from risk assessments. For
example, some organizations may establish the parameter values for security controls in the initial
baselines prior to selecting compensating controls. Other organizations may delay completing
assignment and selection statements in the controls until after the supplementation activities have
been completed. Organizations may also discover that when fully specifying security controls for
the intended environments of operation, there may be difficulties that arise which may trigger the
need for additional (supplemental) controls. Finally, the security control tailoring process is not
static—that is, organizations revisit the tailoring step as often as needed based on ongoing
organizational assessments of risk.
88
The security control selection process also applies to common control providers and the authorizing officials
rendering authorization decisions for common controls deployed within organizations.

CHAPTER 3

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

In addition to the iterative and dynamic nature of the security control tailoring process, there may
also be side effects as controls are added and removed from the baselines. Security controls in
Appendix F can have some degree of dependency and functional overlap with other controls. In
many cases, security controls work together to achieve a security capability. Thus, removing a
particular security control from a baseline during the tailoring process may have unintended side
effects (and potentially adverse impacts) on the remaining controls. Alternatively, adding a new
security control to a baseline during the tailoring process may eliminate or reduce the need for
certain specific controls because the new control provides a better security capability than the
capability provided by other controls. For example, if organizations implement SC-30(2) using
virtualization techniques to randomly/frequently deploy diverse and changing operating systems
and applications, this approach could potentially limit the requirement to update the security
configurations in CM-2(2). Therefore, the addition or removal of security controls is viewed with
regard to the totality of the information security needs of the organization and its information
systems, and not simply with regard to the controls being added or removed.

Implementation Tip
In diverging from the security control baselines during the tailoring process, organizations consider
some very important linkages between various controls and control enhancements. These linkages
are captured in the selection of controls and enhancements in the baselines and are especially
significant when developing overlays (described in Section 3.3 and Appendix I). In some instances,
the linkages are such that it is not meaningful to include a security control or control enhancement
without some other control or enhancement. The totality of the controls and enhancements provide a
required security capability. Some linkages are obvious such as the linkage between Mandatory
Access Control enhancement (AC-3(3)) and Security Attributes (AC-16). But other linkages may be
more subtle. This is especially true in the case where the linkage is between security functionalityrelated controls and security assurance-related controls as described in Appendix E. For example, it
is not particularly meaningful to implement AC-3(3) without also implementing a Reference Monitor
(AC-25). Organizations are encouraged to pay careful attention to the related controls section of the
Supplemental Guidance for the security controls to help in identifying such linkages.

Other Considerations
Organizational tailoring decisions are not carried out in a vacuum. While such decisions are
rightly focused on information security considerations, it is important that the decisions be
aligned with other risk factors that organizations address routinely. Risk factors such as cost,
schedule, and performance are considered in the overall determination of which security controls
to employ in organizational information systems and environments of operation. For example, in
military command and control systems in which lives may be at stake, the adoption of security
controls is balanced with operational necessity. With respect to the air traffic control system and
consoles used by air traffic controllers, the need to access the consoles in real time to control the
air space outweighs the security need for an AC-11, Session Lock. In short, the security control
selection process (to include tailoring activities described in Section 3.2) should be integrated into
the overall risk management process as described in NIST Special Publication 800-39.
Finally, organizations factor scalability into the security control selection process—that is,
controls are scalable with regard to the extent/rigor of the implementation. Scalability is guided
by the FIPS Publication 199 security categorizations and the associated FIPS Publication 200
impact levels of the information systems where the controls are to be applied. For example,
contingency plans for high-impact information systems may contain significant amounts of

CHAPTER 3

PAGE 43

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

implementation detail and be quite lengthy. In contrast, contingency plans for low-impact systems
may contain considerably less detail and be quite succinct. Organizations use discretion in
applying the security controls to organizational information systems, giving consideration to the
scalability factors in particular operational environments. Scaling controls to the appropriate
system impact level facilitates a more cost-effective, risk-based approach to security control
implementation—expending only the level of resources necessary to achieve sufficient risk
mitigation and adequate security.

Implementation Tip
Maintaining a record of security control selection and control status can be addressed in one or
multiple documents or security plans. If using multiple documents, consider providing references to
the necessary information in the relevant documents rather than requiring duplication of information.
Using references to relevant documentation reduces the amount of time and resources needed by
organizations to generate such information. Other benefits include greater security awareness and
understanding of the information system capabilities. Increased security awareness/understanding
supports more effective integration of information security into organizational information systems.

3.5 NEW DEVELOPMENT AND LEGACY SYSTEMS
The security control selection process described in this section can be applied to organizational
information systems from two different perspectives: (i) new development; and (ii) legacy. For
new development systems, the security control selection process is applied from a requirements
definition perspective since the systems do not yet exist and organizations are conducting initial
security categorizations. The security controls included in the security plans for the information
systems serve as a security specification and are expected to be incorporated into the systems
during the development and implementation phases of the system development life cycle. In
contrast, for legacy information systems, the security control selection process is applied from a
gap analysis perspective when organizations are anticipating significant changes to the systems
(e.g., during major upgrades, modifications, or outsourcing). Since the information systems
already exist, organizations in all likelihood have completed the security categorization and
security control selection processes resulting in the establishment of previously agreed-upon
security controls in the respective security plans and the implementation of those controls within
the information systems. Therefore, the gap analysis can be applied in the following manner:
•

First, reconfirm or update as necessary, the security category and impact level for the
information system based on the types of information that are currently being processed,
stored, or transmitted by the system.

•

Second, review the existing security plan that describes the security controls that are currently
employed considering any updates to the security category and information system impact
level as well as any changes to the organization, mission/business processes, the system, or
the operational environment. Reassess the risk and revise the security plan as necessary,
including documenting any additional security controls that would be needed by the system to
ensure that the risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other
organizations, and the Nation, remains at an acceptable level.

•

Third, implement the security controls described in the updated security plan, document in the
plan of action and milestones any controls not implemented, and continue with the remaining
steps in the Risk Management Framework in the same manner as a new development system.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Applying Gap Analyses to External Service Providers
The gap analysis perspective is also applied when interacting with external service providers. As
described in Section 2.5, organizations are becoming increasingly reliant on external providers for
information system services. Using the steps in the gap analysis described above, organizations
can effectively use the acquisition process and appropriate contractual vehicles to require external
providers to carry out the security categorization and security control selection steps in the RMF.
The resulting information can help determine what security controls the external provider either
has in place or intends to implement for the information system services that are to be provided.
If a security control deficit exists, the responsibility for adequately mitigating unacceptable risks
arising from the use of external information system services remains with authorizing officials. In
such situations, organizations can reduce the organizational risk to an acceptable level by:
•

Using the existing contractual vehicle to require the external provider to meet the additional
security control requirements established by the organization;

•

Negotiating with the provider for additional security controls if the existing contractual
vehicle does not provide for such added requirements;

•

Approving the use of compensating controls by the provider; or

•

Employing alternative risk mitigation actions 89 within the organizational information system
when a contract either does not exist or the contract does not provide the necessary leverage
for organizations to obtain the needed security controls.

Implementation Tip
Many organizations operate and maintain complex information systems, often referred to as a
system-of-systems. Enterprise architecture plays a key part in the security control selection process
for these types of information systems. Organizations can address the complex system problem by
dividing the system into two or more subsystems and applying the FIPS 199 security categorization
and FIPS 200 impact level determination to each subsystem. Applying separate impact levels to
each subsystem does not change the overall impact level of the information system; rather, it allows
constituent subsystems to receive a separate allocation of security controls instead of deploying
higher-impact controls across every subsystem. It is not valid to treat the subsystems as entirely
independent entities, however, since the subsystems are interdependent and interconnected.
Organizations develop security architectures to allocate security controls among subsystems
including monitoring and controlling communications at key internal boundaries within the system
and provide system-wide controls that meet or exceed the highest information system impact level of
the constituent subsystems inheriting security capabilities from those controls. Organizations also
consider that replicated subsystems within complex systems may exhibit common vulnerabilities that
can be exploited by common threat sources—thereby negating the redundancy that might be relied
upon as a risk mitigation measure. The impact due to a security incident against one constituent
subsystem might cascade and impact many subsystems at the same time.

89
For example, local policies, procedures, and/or compensating controls could be established by organizations to serve
as alternative mitigation actions for risks identified in a gap analysis.

Sanitization

Actions taken to render data written on media unrecoverable by
both ordinary and, for some forms of sanitization, extraordinary
means.
Process to remove information from media such that data
recovery is not possible. It includes removing all classified labels,
markings, and activity logs.

Scoping Considerations

A part of tailoring guidance providing organizations with specific
considerations on the applicability and implementation of security
controls in the security control baseline. Areas of consideration
include policy/regulatory, technology, physical infrastructure,
system component allocation, operational/environmental, public
access, scalability, common control, and security objective.

Security

A condition that results from the establishment and maintenance
of protective measures that enable an enterprise to perform its
mission or critical functions despite risks posed by threats to its
use of information systems. Protective measures may involve a
combination of deterrence, avoidance, prevention, detection,
recovery, and correction that should form part of the enterprise’s
risk management approach.

APPENDIX D

SECURITY CONTROL BASELINES – SUMMARY
LOW-IMPACT, MODERATE-IMPACT, AND HIGH-IMPACT INFORMATION SYSTEMS

T

his appendix contains the security control baselines that represent the starting point in
determining the security controls for low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact
information systems. 90 The three security control baselines are hierarchical in nature with
regard to the security controls employed in those baselines. 91 If a security control is selected for
one of the baselines, the family identifier and control number are listed in the appropriate column.
If a security control is not used in a particular baseline, the entry is marked not selected. Security
control enhancements, when used to supplement security controls, are indicated by the number of
the enhancement. For example, the IR-2 (1) (2) entry in the high baseline for IR-2 indicates that
the second control from the Incident Response family has been selected along with control
enhancements (1) and (2). Some security controls and enhancements are not used in any of the
baselines in this appendix but are available for use by organizations if needed. This situation
occurs, for example, when the results of a risk assessment indicate the need for additional security
controls or control enhancements in order to adequately mitigate risk to organizational operations
and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.
Organizations can use the recommended priority code designation associated with each security
control in the baselines to assist in making sequencing decisions for control implementation (i.e.,
a Priority Code 1 [P1] control has a higher priority for implementation than a Priority Code 2 [P2]
control; a Priority Code 2 [P2] control has a higher priority for implementation than a Priority
Code 3 [P3] control, and a Priority Code 0 [P0] indicates the security control is not selected in
any baseline). This recommended sequencing prioritization helps ensure that security controls
upon which other controls depend are implemented first, thus enabling organizations to deploy
controls in a more structured and timely manner in accordance with available resources. The
implementation of security controls by sequence priority code does not imply any defined level of
risk mitigation until all controls in the security plan have been implemented. The priority codes
are used only for implementation sequencing, not for making security control selection decisions.
Table D-1 summarizes sequence priority codes for the baseline security controls in Table D-2.
TABLE D-1: SECURITY CONTROL PRIORITIZATION CODES
Priority Code

Sequencing

Action

Priority Code 1 (P1)

FIRST

Implement P1 security controls first.

Priority Code 2 (P2)

NEXT

Implement P2 security controls after implementation of P1 controls.

Priority Code 3 (P3)

LAST

Implement P3 security controls after implementation of P1 and P2 controls.

Unspecified Priority Code (P0)

NONE

Security control not selected in any baseline.

90

A complete description of all security controls is provided in Appendices F and G. In addition, separate documents
for individual security control baselines (listed as Annexes 1, 2, and 3) are available at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications.
An online version of the catalog of security controls is also available at http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/800-53/home.
91
The hierarchical nature applies to the security requirements of each control (i.e., the base control plus all of its
enhancements) at the low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact level in that the control requirements at a
particular impact level (e.g., CP-4 Contingency Plan Testing—Moderate: CP-4(1)) meets a stronger set of security
requirements for that control than the next lower impact level of the same control (e.g., CP-4 Contingency Plan
Testing—Low: CP-4).

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Tables D-3 through D-19 provide a more detailed summary of the security controls and control
enhancements in Appendix F. Each table focuses on a different security control family. Whereas
Table D-2 includes only those security controls and control enhancements allocated to the three
security control baselines, Tables D-3 through D-19 include all controls and enhancements for the
respective security control families. The tables include the following information: (i) the security
controls and control enhancements that have been selected for the security control baselines as
indicated by an “x” in the column for the selected baseline; 93 (ii) the security controls and control
enhancements that have not been selected for any security control baseline (i.e., the controls and
control enhancements available for selection to achieve greater protection) as indicated by blank
cells in the baseline columns; (iii) the security controls and control enhancements that have been
withdrawn from Appendix F as indicated by an “x” in the respective withdrawn column; and (iv)
the security controls and control enhancements that have assurance-related characteristics or
properties (i.e., assurance-related controls) as indicated by an “x” in the respective assurance
column. Assurance-related controls are discussed in greater detail in Appendix E to include the
allocation of such controls to security control baselines (see Tables E-1 through E-3).

93

The security control baselines in Tables D-3 through D-19 are only applicable to non-national security systems.
Security control baselines for national security systems are included in CNSS Instruction 1253.

ADJUSTMENTS TO SECURITY CONTROL BASELINES
ALLOCATION OF SECURITY CONTROLS AND ASSIGNMENT OF PRIORITY SEQUENCING CODES

With each revision to SP 800-53, minor adjustments may occur with the security control baselines
including, for example, allocating additional controls and/or control enhancements, eliminating
selected controls/enhancements, and changing sequencing priority codes (P-codes). These changes
reflect: (i) the ongoing receipt and analysis of threat information; (ii) the periodic reexamination of
the initial assumptions that generated the security control baselines; (iii) the desire for common
security control baseline starting points for national security and non-national security systems to
achieve community-wide convergence (relying subsequently on specific overlays to describe any
adjustments from the common starting points); and (iv) the periodic reassessment of priority codes
to appropriately balance the workload of security control implementation. Over time, as the security
control catalog expands to address the continuing challenges from a dynamic and growing threat
space that is increasingly sophisticated, organizations will come to rely to a much greater degree on
overlays to provide the needed specialization for their security plans.

APPENDIX E

ASSURANCE AND TRUSTWORTHINESS
MEASURES OF CONFIDENCE FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS

S

ecurity assurance is a critical aspect in determining the trustworthiness of information
systems. Assurance is the measure of confidence that the security functions, features,
practices, policies, procedures, mechanisms, and architecture of organizational information
systems accurately mediate and enforce established security policies. 94 The objective of this
appendix is:
•

To encourage organizations to include assurance requirements in procurements of
information systems, system components, and services;

•

To encourage hardware, software, and firmware developers to employ development practices
that result in more trustworthy information technology products and systems;

•

To encourage organizations to identify, select, and use information technology products that
have been built with appropriate levels of assurance and to employ sound systems and
security engineering techniques and methods during the system development life cycle
process;

•

To reduce information security risk by deploying more trustworthy information technology
products within critical information systems or system components; and

•

To encourage developers and organizations to obtain on an ongoing basis, assurance evidence
for maintaining trustworthiness of information systems.

Minimum security requirements for federal information and information systems are defined in
FIPS Publication 200. These requirements can be satisfied by selecting, tailoring, implementing,
and obtaining assurance evidence for the security controls in the low, moderate, or high baselines
in Appendix D. 95 The baselines also include the assurance-related controls for the minimum
assurance requirements that are generally applicable to federal information and information
systems. 96 However, considering the current threat space and the increasing risk to organizational
operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation, posed by the advanced
persistent threat (APT), organizations may choose to implement additional assurance-related
controls from Appendix F. These additional controls can be selected based on the tailoring
guidance provided in Section 3.2. Organizations can also consider developing high-assurance
overlays for critical missions/business functions, specialized environments of operation, and/or
information technologies (see Section 3.3 and Appendix I). When assurance-related controls
cannot be satisfied, organizations can propose compensating controls (e.g., procedural/operational
94

Section 2.6 provides an introduction to the concepts of assurance and trustworthiness and how the two concepts are
related. A trustworthiness model is illustrated in Figure 3.
95
CNSS Instruction 1253 provides security control baselines for national security systems. Therefore, the assurancerelated controls in the baselines established for the national security community, if so designated, may differ from those
controls designated in Tables E-1 through E-3.
96

It is difficult to determine if a given security control baseline from Appendix D provides the assurance needed across
all information technologies, users, platforms, and organizations. For example, while the use of formal methods might
be appropriate in a cross-domain product, different assurance techniques might be appropriate for a complex air traffic
control system or for a web server providing emergency preparedness information from the Department of Homeland
Security. Still, the existing baselines do have assurance aspects that reflect the minimum assurance that is anticipated to
be common across all technologies, users, platforms, and organizations.

solutions to compensate for insufficient technology-based solutions) or assume a greater degree
of risk with regard to the actual security capability achieved.

The New Look for Assurance
While previous versions of Special Publication 800-53 addressed minimum assurance requirements,
the focus was on higher-level, more abstract requirements applied to the low, moderate, and high
baselines. This revision takes a fundamentally different approach to assurance by defining specific
assurance-related security controls in Appendix F that can be implemented by organizations based
on the security categorizations of their information systems—making the assurance requirements
more actionable and providing opportunities for increasing the levels of assurance based on mission
and business needs, current/projected threats, unique operating environments, or the use of new
technologies. The identification of specific assurance-related controls in the low, moderate, and high
baselines in easy-to read tables (Tables E-1, E-2, E-3) helps organizations to quickly define controls
necessary to satisfy minimum assurance requirements. The optional assurance-related controls in
Table E-4 provide organizations with specification language to use in acquisitions targeted at the
developers of information systems, system components, and information system services. The
controls address specific methodologies, techniques, design, and architectural considerations as
well as sound system and security engineering principles to fundamentally improve the quality of
hardware, software, and firmware components that will be integrated into organizational information
systems or the critical infrastructure. The designation of assurance-related controls is not intended to
imply a greater level of importance for such controls. Achieving adequate security for organizational
information systems requires the correct combination of both functionality- and assurance-related
security controls. Only by understanding the importance of the concept of assurance and recognizing
which security controls are more assurance-oriented versus functionality-oriented can organizations
select the most appropriate combination of controls to protect their organizational operations and
assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.

The following sections provide a description of the assurance-related controls that are included in
each of the security control baselines in Appendix D. The criteria for whether a security control is
assurance-related or functionality-related is based on the overall characteristics of the control. In
general, assurance-related controls are controls that: (i) define processes, procedures, techniques,
or methodologies for designing and developing information systems and system components (i.e.,
hardware, software, firmware); (ii) provide supporting operational processes including improving
the quality of systems/components/processes; (iii) produce security evidence from developmental
or operational activities; (iv) determine security control effectiveness or risk (e.g., audit, testing,
evaluation, analysis, assessment, verification, validation, monitoring); or (v) improve personnel
skills, expertise, and understanding (e.g., security awareness/training, incident response training,
contingency training).
Security controls may be designated as assurance-related controls even when the controls exhibit
some functional characteristics or properties (e.g., SI-4, Information System Monitoring). The
distinction between functionality and assurance is less important when describing the assurancerelated controls in the baselines—primarily because the security controls in the three baselines
after the tailoring process is applied, become part of the security plans for information systems
and for organizations. 97 However, the distinction becomes more important when organizations
exercise the option of selecting additional security controls to increase the level of assurance (or
the degree of confidence) in the security functionality and security capability.
97
Organizations are cautioned to carefully examine the assurance-related controls in the baselines during the tailoring
process, including the development of overlays, to help ensure that controls are not being inadvertently eliminated that
provide the measures of confidence in the security functionality needed for mission/business protection.

Minimum Assurance Requirements – Low-Impact Systems
Assurance Requirement: The organization, based on its security requirements, security policies, and needed

security capabilities, has an expectation of: (i) a limited strength of security functionality; and (ii) a limited
degree of confidence supported by the depth and coverage of associated security evidence, that the security
functionality is complete, consistent, and correct.
Supplemental Guidance: Security functionality and assurance for low-impact systems are achieved by the

implementation of security controls from the tailored low baseline in Appendix D. Assurance requirements
for low-impact systems (including the information technology components that are part of those systems),
align with that which is readily achievable with unmodified, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products and
services. Due to the limited strength of functionality expected for low-impact systems, the depth/coverage
of security evidence 98 produced is minimal and is not expected to be more than what is routinely provided
by COTS manufacturers, vendors, and resellers. The depth/coverage evidence is further supplemented by
the results of security control assessments and the ongoing monitoring of organizational information
systems and environments in which the systems operate. For other than technology-based functionality, the
emphasis is on a limited degree of confidence in the completeness, correctness, and consistency of
procedural and/or operational security functionality (e.g., policies, procedures, physical security, and
personnel security). Assurance requirements specified in the form of developmental and operational
assurance controls for low-impact systems are listed in Table E-1. Organizations, through the tailoring
process (including an organizational assessment of risk), may choose to add other assurance-related
controls and/or control enhancements to the set included in Table E-1.

Minimum Assurance Requirements – Moderate-Impact Systems
Assurance Requirement: The organization, based on its security requirements, security policies, and needed

security capabilities, has an expectation of: (i) a moderate strength of security functionality; and (ii) a
moderate degree of confidence supported by the depth and coverage of associated security evidence, that
the security functionality is complete, consistent, and correct.
Supplemental Guidance: Security functionality and assurance for moderate-impact systems are achieved by

the implementation of security controls from the tailored moderate baseline in Appendix D. Assurance
requirements for moderate-impact systems (including the information technology components that are part
of those systems) add to the expectations at the low-assurance level by: (i) incorporating COTS security
functionality with greater strength of mechanism and capability than the strength of mechanism and
capability achieved in low-impact systems; (ii) requiring perhaps, some special development; (iii)
establishing more secure configuration settings; and (iv) requiring some additional assessment of the
implemented capability. Due to the moderate strength of functionality expected for moderate-impact
systems, the depth/coverage of security evidence 100 produced is more substantial than the minimal evidence
produced for low-impact systems but still in the range of what can be provided by COTS manufacturers,
vendors, and resellers. The depth/coverage evidence is further supplemented by the results of additional
security control assessments and the ongoing monitoring of organizational information systems and
environments of operation. For other than technology-based functionality, the emphasis is on a moderate
degree of confidence in the completeness, correctness, and consistency of procedural and/or operational
security functionality (e.g., policies, procedures, physical security, and personnel security). Assurance
requirements in the form of developmental and operational assurance controls for moderate-impact systems
are listed in Table E-2. Organizations, through the tailoring process (including an organizational assessment
of risk), may choose to add other assurance-related controls and/or control enhancements to the set
included in Table E-2.

Minimum Assurance Requirements – High-Impact Systems
Assurance Requirement: The organization, based on its security requirements, security policies, and needed

security capabilities, has an expectation of: (i) a high strength of security functionality; and (ii) a high
degree of confidence supported by the depth and coverage of associated security evidence, that the security
functionality is complete, consistent, and correct.
Supplemental Guidance: Security functionality and assurance for high-impact systems are achieved by the

implementation of security controls from the tailored high baseline in Appendix D. Assurance requirements
for high-impact systems (including the information technology components that are part of those systems),
add to the expectations at the moderate assurance level by: (i) incorporating higher-end COTS security
capabilities that result from the application of commonly accepted best commercial development practices
for reducing latent flaw rates, some special development, and additional assessment of the implemented
capability. Due to the high strength of functionality expected for high-impact systems, the depth/coverage
of security evidence 102 produced is more comprehensive than the evidence produced for moderate-impact
systems. Although the evidence may still be in the range of what can be provided by COTS manufacturers,
vendors, and resellers, greater assurance from independent assessment providers may be required. The
depth/coverage evidence is supplemented by the results of additional security control assessments and the
ongoing monitoring of organizational information systems/environments of operation. For other than
technology-based functionality, there is a high degree of confidence in the completeness, correctness, and
consistency of procedural and/or operational security functionality (e.g., policies, procedures, physical
security, and personnel security). Assurance requirements in the form of developmental and operational
assurance controls for high-impact information systems are listed in Table E-3. Organizations, through the
tailoring process (including an organizational assessment of risk), may choose to add other assurancerelated controls and/or control enhancements to the set included in Table E-3.

Security Controls to Achieve Enhanced Assurance

While the assurance-related controls allocated to the low, moderate, and high baselines in the
previous sections, represent minimum assurance requirements, organizations can, over time,
choose to raise the level of assurance in their information systems—increasing the level of
trustworthiness accordingly. This is accomplished by adding assurance-related controls to the
controls in the baselines to increase both the strength of security functionality and degree of
confidence that the functionality is correct, complete, and consistent—making the functionality
highly resistant to penetration, tamper, or bypass. Security functionality that is highly resistant to
penetration, tamper, and bypass requires a significant work factor on the part of adversaries to
compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the information system or system
components where that functionality is employed.
Since high-assurance information technology products may be more costly and difficult to obtain,
organizations may choose to partition their information systems into distinct subsystems to isolate
the critical components and focus the high-assurance efforts on a more narrowly defined subset of
information resources. Organizations that find it difficult to achieve high-assurance information
technology solutions may have to rely to a greater extent on procedural or operational protections
to ensure mission and business success. This includes, for example, reengineering critical mission
and business processes to be less susceptible to high-end threats. Table E-4 provides additional
developmental and operational activities (e.g., in the SA, SI, and CM security control families),
that organizations can select to achieve an enhanced level of assurance (up to and including high
assurance). The list of assurance-related controls is not intended to be exhaustive. Organizations,
during the tailoring process, may choose to designate other security controls as assurance-related
and add to the exemplar set in Table E-4.

APPENDIX F

SECURITY CONTROL CATALOG
SECURITY CONTROLS, ENHANCEMENTS, AND SUPPLEMENTAL GUIDANCE

T

he catalog of security controls in this appendix provides a range of safeguards and
countermeasures for organizations and information systems. 105 The security controls have
been designed to facilitate compliance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders,
directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. 106 The organization of the security
control catalog, the structure of the security controls, and the concept of allocating security
controls and control enhancements to the initial baselines in Appendix D are described in Chapter
Two. The security controls in the catalog with few exceptions, have been designed to be policyand technology-neutral. This means that security controls and control enhancements focus on the
fundamental safeguards and countermeasures necessary to protect information during processing,
while in storage, and during transmission. Therefore, it is beyond the scope of this publication to
provide guidance on the application of security controls to specific technologies, communities of
interest, environments of operation, or missions/business functions. These areas are addressed by
the use of the tailoring process described in Chapter Three and the development of overlays
described in Appendix I.
In the few cases where specific technologies are called out in security controls (e.g., mobile, PKI,
wireless, VOIP), organizations are cautioned that the need to provide adequate security goes well
beyond the requirements in a single control associated with a particular technology. Many of the
needed safeguards/countermeasures are obtained from the other security controls in the catalog
allocated to the initial control baselines as the starting point for the development of security plans
and overlays using the tailoring process. In addition to the organization-driven development of
specialized security plans and overlays, NIST Special Publications and Interagency Reports may
provide guidance on recommended security controls for specific technologies and sector-specific
applications (e.g., Smart Grid, healthcare, Industrial Control Systems, and mobile).
Employing a policy- and technology-neutral security control catalog has the following benefits:
•

It encourages organizations to focus on the security capabilities required for mission/business
success and the protection of information, irrespective of the information technologies that
are employed in organizational information systems;

•

It encourages organizations to analyze each security control for its applicability to specific
technologies, environments of operation, missions/business functions, and communities of
interest; and

105

An online version of the catalog of security controls is also available at http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/800-53/home.

106
Compliance necessitates organizations executing due diligence with regard to information security and risk
management. Information security due diligence includes using all appropriate information as part of an organizationwide risk management program to effectively use the tailoring guidance and inherent flexibility in NIST publications so
that the selected security controls documented in organizational security plans meet the specific mission and business
requirements of organizations. Using the risk management tools and techniques that are available to organizations is
essential in developing, implementing, and maintaining the safeguards and countermeasures with the necessary and
sufficient strength of mechanism to address the current threats to organizational operations and assets, individuals,
other organizations, and the Nation. Employing effective risk-based processes, procedures, and technologies will help
ensure that all federal information systems and organizations have the necessary resilience to support ongoing federal
responsibilities, critical infrastructure applications, and continuity of government.

•

It encourages organizations to specify security policies as part of the tailoring process for
security controls that have variable parameters.

For example, organizations using smart phones, tablets, or other types of mobile devices would
start the tailoring process by assuming that all security controls and control enhancements in the
appropriate baseline (low, moderate, or high) are needed. The tailoring process may result in
certain security controls being eliminated for a variety of reasons, including, for example, the
inability of the technology to support the implementation of the control. However, the elimination
of such controls without understanding the potential adverse impacts to organizational missions
and business functions can significantly increase information security risk and should be carefully
analyzed. This type of analysis is essential in order for organizations to make effective risk-based
decisions including the selection of appropriate compensating security controls, when considering
the use of these emerging mobile devices and technologies. The specialization of security plans
using the tailoring guidance and overlays, together with a comprehensive set of technology- and
policy-neutral security controls, promotes cost-effective, risk-based information security for
organizations—in any sector, for any technology, and in any operating environment.
The security controls in the catalog are expected to change over time, as controls are withdrawn,
revised, and added. In order to maintain stability in security plans and automated tools supporting
the implementation of Special Publication 800-53, security controls will not be renumbered each
time a control is withdrawn. Rather, notations of security controls that have been withdrawn are
maintained in the catalog for historical purposes. Security controls are withdrawn for a variety of
reasons including, for example: the security capability provided by the withdrawn control has
been incorporated into another control; the security capability provided by the withdrawn control
is redundant to an existing control; or the security control is deemed to be no longer necessary.
There may, on occasion, be repetition in requirements that appear in the security controls and
control enhancements that are part of the security control catalog. This repetition in requirements
is intended to reinforce the security requirements from the perspective of multiple controls and/or
enhancements. For example, the requirement for strong identification and authentication when
conducting remote maintenance activities appears in the MA family in the specific context of
systems maintenance activities conducted by organizations. The identification and authentication
requirement also appears in a more general context in the IA family. While these requirements
appear to be redundant (i.e., overlapping), they are, in fact, mutually reinforcing and not intended
to require additional effort on the part of organizations in the development and implementation of
security programs.

Implementation Tip
New security controls and control enhancements will be developed on a regular basis using state-ofthe-practice information from national-level threat and vulnerability databases as well as information
on the tactics, techniques, and procedures employed by adversaries in launching cyber attacks. The
proposed modifications to security controls and security control baselines will be carefully weighed
during each revision cycle, considering the desire for stability of the security control catalog and the
need to respond to changing threats, vulnerabilities, attack methods, and information technologies.
The overall objective is to raise the basic level of information security over time. Organizations may
choose to develop new security controls when there is a specific security capability required and the
appropriate controls are not available in Appendices F or G.

SECURITY CONTROL CLASS DESIGNATIONS
MANAGEMENT, OPERATIONAL, AND TECHNICAL REFERENCES

Because many security controls within the security control families in Appendix F have various
combinations of management, operational, and technical properties, the specific class designations
have been removed from the security control families. Organizations may still find it useful to
apply such designations to individual security controls and control enhancements or to individual
sections within a particular control/enhancement. Organizations may find it beneficial to employ
class designations as a way to group or refer to security controls. The class designations may also
help organizations with the process of allocating security controls and control enhancements to: (i)
responsible parties or information systems (e.g., as common or hybrid controls); (ii) specific roles;
and/or (iii) specific components of a system. For example, organizations may determine that the
responsibility for system-specific controls they have placed in the management class belong to the
information system owner, controls placed in the operational class belong to the Information
System Security Officer (ISSO), and controls placed in the technical class belong to one or more
system administrators. This example is provided to illustrate the potential usefulness of designating
classes for controls and/or control enhancements; it is not meant to suggest or require additional
tasks for organizations.

CAUTIONARY NOTE
DEVELOPMENT OF SYSTEMS, COMPONENTS, AND SERVICES

With the renewed emphasis on trustworthy information systems and supply chain security, it is
essential that organizations have the capability to express their information security requirements
with clarity and specificity in order to engage the information technology industry and obtain the
systems, components, and services necessary for mission and business success. To ensure that
organizations have such capability, Special Publication 800-53 provides a set of security controls in
the System and Services Acquisition family (i.e., SA family) addressing requirements for the
development of information systems, information technology products, and information system
services. Therefore, many of the controls in the SA family are directed at developers of those
systems, components, and services. It is important for organizations to recognize that the scope of
the security controls in the SA family includes all system/component/service development and the
developers associated with such development whether the development is conducted by internal
organizational personnel or by external developers through the contracting/acquisition process.
Affected controls include SA-8, SA-10, SA-11, SA-15, SA-16, SA-17, SA-20, and SA-21.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Fundamentals of the Catalog
Security controls and control enhancements in Appendices F and G are generally designed to be
policy-neutral and technology/implementation-independent. Organizations provide information
about security controls and control enhancements in two ways:
• By specifying security control implementation details (e.g., platform dependencies) in the
associated security plan for the information system or security program plan for the
organization; and
• By establishing specific values in the variable sections of selected security controls through the
use of assignment and selection statements.
Assignment and selection statements provide organizations with the capability to specialize
security controls and control enhancements based on organizational security requirements or
requirements originating in federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations,
standards, or guidelines. Organization-defined parameters used in assignment and selection
statements in the basic security controls apply also to all control enhancements associated with
those controls. Control enhancements strengthen the fundamental security capability in the base
control but are not a substitute for using assignment or selection statements to provide greater
specificity to the control. Assignment statements for security controls and control enhancements
do not contain minimum or maximum values (e.g., testing contingency plans at least annually).
Organizations should consult specific federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations,
policies, standards, or guidelines as the definitive sources for such information. The absence of
minimum and maximum values from the security controls and control enhancements does not
obviate the need for organizations to comply with requirements in the controlling source
publications.
The first security control in each family (i.e., the dash-1 control) generates requirements for
specific policies and procedures that are needed for the effective implementation of the other
security controls in the family. Therefore, individual controls and control enhancements in a
particular family do not call for the development of such policies and procedures. Supplemental
guidance sections of security controls and control enhancements do not contain any requirements
or references to FIPS or NIST Special Publications. NIST publications are, however, included in
a references section for each security control.
In support of the Joint Task Force initiative to develop a unified information security framework
for the federal government, security controls and control enhancements for national security
systems are included in this appendix. The inclusion of such controls and enhancements is not
intended to impose security requirements on organizations that operate national security systems.
Rather, organizations can use the security controls and control enhancements on a voluntary basis
with the approval of federal officials exercising policy authority over national security systems. In
addition, the security control priorities and security control baselines listed in Appendix D and in
the priority and baseline allocation summary boxes below each security control in Appendix F,
apply to non-national security systems only unless otherwise directed by the federal officials with
national security policy authority.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Using the Catalog
Organizations employ security controls 107 in federal information systems and the environments in
which those systems operate in accordance with FIPS Publication 199, FIPS Publication 200, and
NIST Special Publications 800-37 and 800-39. Security categorization of federal information and
information systems, as required by FIPS Publication 199, is the first step in the RMF. 108 Next,
organizations select the appropriate security control baselines for their information systems by
satisfying the minimum security requirements set forth in FIPS Publication 200. Appendix D
includes three security control baselines that are associated with the designated impact levels of
information systems as determined during the security categorization process. 109 After baseline
selection, organizations tailor the baselines by: (i) identifying/designating common controls; (ii)
applying scoping considerations; (iii) selecting compensating controls, if needed; (iv) assigning
control parameter values in selection and assignment statements; (v) supplementing the baseline
controls with additional controls and control enhancements from the security control catalog; and
(vi) providing additional information for control implementation. Organizations can also use the
baseline tailoring process with the overlay concept that is described in Section 3.2 and Appendix
I. Risk assessments, as described in NIST Special Publication 800-30, guide and inform the
security control selection process. 110

CAUTIONARY NOTE
USE OF CRYPTOGRAPHY

If cryptography is required for the protection of information based on the selection of security
controls in Appendix F and subsequently implemented by organizational information systems, the
cryptographic mechanisms comply with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives,
policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. This includes, for NSA-approved cryptography to
protect classified information, FIPS-validated cryptography to protect unclassified information, and
NSA-approved and FIPS-compliant key management technologies and processes. Security controls
SC-12 and SC-13 provide specific information on the selection of appropriate cryptographic
mechanisms, including the strength of such mechanisms.

107

The security controls in Special Publication 800-53 are available online and can be downloaded in various formats
from the NIST web site at: http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/800-53/home.

CNSS Instruction 1253 provides guidance for security categorization of national security systems.

109

CNSS Instruction 1253 provides guidance on security control baselines for national security systems and specific
tailoring requirements associated with such systems.
110

There are additional security controls and control enhancements that appear in the catalog that are not used in any of
the initial baselines. These additional controls and control enhancements are available to organizations and can be used
in the tailoring process to achieve the needed level of protection in accordance with organizational risk assessments.

individuals are removed from the group.

Supplemental Guidance: Information system account types include, for example, individual, shared,

group, system, guest/anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor, temporary, and
service. Some of the account management requirements listed above can be implemented by
organizational information systems. The identification of authorized users of the information
system and the specification of access privileges reflects the requirements in other security
controls in the security plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on information system
accounts receive additional scrutiny by appropriate organizational personnel (e.g., system owner,
mission/business owner, or chief information security officer) responsible for approving such
accounts and privileged access. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other
attributes by account, by type of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes required for
authorizing access include, for example, restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week, and point-oforigin. In defining other account attributes, organizations consider system-related requirements
(e.g., scheduled maintenance, system upgrades) and mission/business requirements, (e.g., time
zone differences, customer requirements, remote access to support travel requirements). Failure to
consider these factors could affect information system availability. Temporary and emergency
accounts are accounts intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary accounts as a
part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without
the demand for immediacy in account activation. Organizations establish emergency accounts in
response to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account activation. Therefore, emergency
account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. Emergency and temporary
accounts are not to be confused with infrequently used accounts (e.g., local logon accounts used
for special tasks defined by organizations or when network resources are unavailable). Such
accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic disabling or removal dates. Conditions
for disabling or deactivating accounts include, for example: (i) when shared/group, emergency, or
temporary accounts are no longer required; or (ii) when individuals are transferred or terminated.
Some types of information system accounts may require specialized training. Related controls:

Control Enhancements:
(1)

ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | AUTOMATED SYSTEM ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT

The organization employs automated mechanisms to support the management of information
system accounts.
Supplemental Guidance: The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using
email or text messaging to automatically notify account managers when users are terminated
or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and using telephonic
notification to report atypical system account usage.

ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | REMOVAL OF TEMPORARY / EMERGENCY ACCOUNTS

The information system automatically [Selection: removes; disables] temporary and emergency
accounts after [Assignment: organization-defined time period for each type of account].
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement requires the removal of both temporary and
emergency accounts automatically after a predefined period of time has elapsed, rather than at
the convenience of the systems administrator.
(3)

ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | DISABLE INACTIVE ACCOUNTS

The information system automatically disables inactive accounts after [Assignment: organizationdefined time period].
(4)

ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | AUTOMATED AUDIT ACTIONS

The information system automatically audits account creation, modification, enabling, disabling,
and removal actions, and notifies [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].
Supplemental Guidance: Related controls: AU-2, AU-12.
(5)

ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | INACTIVITY LOGOUT

The organization requires that users log out when [Assignment: organization-defined time-period
of expected inactivity or description of when to log out].
Supplemental Guidance: Related control: SC-23.
(6)

ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | DYNAMIC PRIVILEGE MANAGEMENT

The information system implements the following dynamic privilege management capabilities:
[Assignment: organization-defined list of dynamic privilege management capabilities].
Supplemental Guidance: In contrast to conventional access control approaches which employ
static information system accounts and predefined sets of user privileges, dynamic access
control approaches (e.g., service-oriented architectures) rely on run time access control
decisions facilitated by dynamic privilege management. While user identities may remain
relatively constant over time, user privileges may change more frequently based on ongoing
mission/business requirements and operational needs of organizations. Dynamic privilege
management can include, for example, the immediate revocation of privileges from users, as
opposed to requiring that users terminate and restart their sessions to reflect any changes in
privileges. Dynamic privilege management can also refer to mechanisms that change the
privileges of users based on dynamic rules as opposed to editing specific user profiles. This
type of privilege management includes, for example, automatic adjustments of privileges if
users are operating out of their normal work times, or if information systems are under duress
or in emergency maintenance situations. This control enhancement also includes the ancillary
effects of privilege changes, for example, the potential changes to encryption keys used for
communications. Dynamic privilege management can support requirements for information
system resiliency. Related control: AC-16.
(7)

ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | ROLE-BASED SCHEMES

The organization:
(a)

Establishes and administers privileged user accounts in accordance with a role-based access
scheme that organizes allowed information system access and privileges into roles;

(b) Monitors privileged role assignments; and
(c)

Takes [Assignment: organization-defined actions] when privileged role assignments are no
longer appropriate.

Supplemental Guidance: Privileged roles are organization-defined roles assigned to individuals
that allow those individuals to perform certain security-relevant functions that ordinary users
are not authorized to perform. These privileged roles include, for example, key management,
account management, network and system administration, database administration, and web
administration.
(8)

ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | DYNAMIC ACCOUNT CREATION

The information system creates [Assignment: organization-defined information system accounts]
dynamically.
Supplemental Guidance: Dynamic approaches for creating information system accounts (e.g., as
implemented within service-oriented architectures) rely on establishing accounts (identities) at

APPENDIX F-AC

run time for entities that were previously unknown. Organizations plan for dynamic creation
of information system accounts by establishing trust relationships and mechanisms with the
appropriate authorities to validate related authorizations and privileges. Related control: AC16.
(9)

ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | RESTRICTIONS ON USE OF SHARED / GROUP ACCOUNTS

The organization only permits the use of shared/group accounts that meet [Assignment:
organization-defined conditions for establishing shared/group accounts].
(10) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | SHARED / GROUP ACCOUNT CREDENTIAL TERMINATION
The information system terminates shared/group account credentials when members leave the
group.
(11) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | USAGE CONDITIONS
The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined circumstances and/or usage
conditions] for [Assignment: organization-defined information system accounts].
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations can describe the specific conditions or circumstances
under which information system accounts can be used, for example, by restricting usage to
certain days of the week, time of day, or specific durations of time.
(12) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | ACCOUNT MONITORING / ATYPICAL USAGE
The organization:
(a)

Monitors information system accounts for [Assignment: organization-defined atypical usage];
and

(b) Reports atypical usage of information system accounts to [Assignment: organization-defined
personnel or roles].
Supplemental Guidance: Atypical usage includes, for example, accessing information systems

at certain times of the day and from locations that are not consistent with the normal usage
patterns of individuals working in organizations. Related control: CA-7.
(13) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT | DISABLE ACCOUNTS FOR HIGH-RISK INDIVIDUALS
The organization disables accounts of users posing a significant risk within [Assignment:
organization-defined time period] of discovery of the risk.
Supplemental Guidance: Users posing a significant risk to organizations include individuals for
whom reliable evidence or intelligence indicates either the intention to use authorized access
to information systems to cause harm or through whom adversaries will cause harm. Harm
includes potential adverse impacts to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other
organizations, or the Nation. Close coordination between authorizing officials, information
system administrators, and human resource managers is essential in order for timely execution
of this control enhancement. Related control: PS-4.

ACCESS ENFORCEMENT
Control: The information system enforces approved authorizations for logical access to information
and system resources in accordance with applicable access control policies.
Supplemental Guidance: Access control policies (e.g., identity-based policies, role-based policies,

control matrices, cryptography) control access between active entities or subjects (i.e., users or
processes acting on behalf of users) and passive entities or objects (e.g., devices, files, records,
domains) in information systems. In addition to enforcing authorized access at the information
system level and recognizing that information systems can host many applications and services in
support of organizational missions and business operations, access enforcement mechanisms can
also be employed at the application and service level to provide increased information security.

Control Enhancements:

ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | RESTRICTED ACCESS TO PRIVILEGED FUNCTIONS

[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AC-6].
(2)

ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | DUAL AUTHORIZATION
The information system enforces dual authorization for [Assignment: organization-defined
privileged commands and/or other organization-defined actions].

Supplemental Guidance: Dual authorization mechanisms require the approval of two authorized
individuals in order to execute. Organizations do not require dual authorization mechanisms
when immediate responses are necessary to ensure public and environmental safety. Dual
authorization may also be known as two-person control. Related controls: CP-9, MP-6.
(3)

ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | MANDATORY ACCESS CONTROL

The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined mandatory access control
policy] over all subjects and objects where the policy:
(a)

Is uniformly enforced across all subjects and objects within the boundary of the information
system;

(b) Specifies that a subject that has been granted access to information is constrained from doing
any of the following;

(c)

(1)

Passing the information to unauthorized subjects or objects;

(2)

Granting its privileges to other subjects;

(3)

Changing one or more security attributes on subjects, objects, the information system, or
information system components;

(4)

Choosing the security attributes and attribute values to be associated with newly created
or modified objects; or

(5)

Changing the rules governing access control; and

Specifies that [Assignment: organization-defined subjects] may explicitly be granted
[Assignment: organization-defined privileges (i.e., they are trusted subjects)] such that they
are not limited by some or all of the above constraints.

Supplemental Guidance: Mandatory access control as defined in this control enhancement is
synonymous with nondiscretionary access control, and is not constrained only to certain
historical uses (e.g., implementations using the Bell-LaPadula Model). The above class of
mandatory access control policies constrains what actions subjects can take with information
obtained from data objects for which they have already been granted access, thus preventing
the subjects from passing the information to unauthorized subjects and objects. This class of
mandatory access control policies also constrains what actions subjects can take with respect
to the propagation of access control privileges; that is, a subject with a privilege cannot pass
that privilege to other subjects. The policy is uniformly enforced over all subjects and objects
to which the information system has control. Otherwise, the access control policy can be
circumvented. This enforcement typically is provided via an implementation that meets the
reference monitor concept (see AC-25). The policy is bounded by the information system
boundary (i.e., once the information is passed outside of the control of the system, additional
means may be required to ensure that the constraints on the information remain in effect). The
trusted subjects described above are granted privileges consistent with the concept of least
privilege (see AC-6). Trusted subjects are only given the minimum privileges relative to the
above policy necessary for satisfying organizational mission/business needs. The control is
most applicable when there is some policy mandate (e.g., law, Executive Order, directive, or
regulation) that establishes a policy regarding access to sensitive/classified information and
some users of the information system are not authorized access to all sensitive/classified
information resident in the information system. This control can operate in conjunction with
AC-3 (4). A subject that is constrained in its operation by policies governed by this control is
still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of AC-3 (4), but policies governed by
this control take precedence over the less rigorous constraints of AC-3 (4). For example,

APPENDIX F-AC

PAGE F-11

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

while a mandatory access control policy imposes a constraint preventing a subject from
passing information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity label, AC-3 (4)
permits the subject to pass the information to any subject with the same sensitivity label as the
subject. Related controls: AC-25, SC-11.
(4)

ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | DISCRETIONARY ACCESS CONTROL

The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined discretionary access control
policy] over defined subjects and objects where the policy specifies that a subject that has been
granted access to information can do one or more of the following:
(a)

Pass the information to any other subjects or objects;

(b) Grant its privileges to other subjects;
(c)

Change security attributes on subjects, objects, the information system, or the information
system’s components;

(d) Choose the security attributes to be associated with newly created or revised objects; or
(e)

Change the rules governing access control.

Supplemental Guidance: When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects
are not constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information for which they
have already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been granted access to information
are not prevented from passing (i.e., the subjects have the discretion to pass) the information
to other subjects or objects. This control enhancement can operate in conjunction with AC-3
(3). A subject that is constrained in its operation by policies governed by AC-3 (3) is still able
to operate under the less rigorous constraints of this control enhancement. Thus, while AC-3
(3) imposes constraints preventing a subject from passing information to another subject
operating at a different sensitivity level, AC-3 (4) permits the subject to pass the information
to any subject at the same sensitivity level. The policy is bounded by the information system
boundary. Once the information is passed outside of the control of the information system,
additional means may be required to ensure that the constraints remain in effect. While the
older, more traditional definitions of discretionary access control require identity-based access
control, that limitation is not required for this use of discretionary access control.
(5)

ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | SECURITY-RELEVANT INFORMATION

The information system prevents access to [Assignment: organization-defined security-relevant
information] except during secure, non-operable system states.
Supplemental Guidance: Security-relevant information is any information within information
systems that can potentially impact the operation of security functions or the provision of
security services in a manner that could result in failure to enforce system security policies or
maintain the isolation of code and data. Security-relevant information includes, for example,
filtering rules for routers/firewalls, cryptographic key management information, configuration
parameters for security services, and access control lists. Secure, non-operable system states
include the times in which information systems are not performing mission/business-related
processing (e.g., the system is off-line for maintenance, troubleshooting, boot-up, shut down).
Related control: CM-3.
(6)

ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | PROTECTION OF USER AND SYSTEM INFORMATION

(7)

ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL

[Withdrawn: Incorporated into MP-4 and SC-28].
The information system enforces a role-based access control policy over defined subjects and
objects and controls access based upon [Assignment: organization-defined roles and users
authorized to assume such roles].
Supplemental Guidance: Role-based access control (RBAC) is an access control policy that
restricts information system access to authorized users. Organizations can create specific roles
based on job functions and the authorizations (i.e., privileges) to perform needed operations
on organizational information systems associated with the organization-defined roles. When
users are assigned to the organizational roles, they inherit the authorizations or privileges
defined for those roles. RBAC simplifies privilege administration for organizations because
privileges are not assigned directly to every user (which can be a significant number of

APPENDIX F-AC

PAGE F-12

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

individuals for mid- to large-size organizations) but are instead acquired through role
assignments. RBAC can be implemented either as a mandatory or discretionary form of
access control. For organizations implementing RBAC with mandatory access controls, the
requirements in AC-3 (3) define the scope of the subjects and objects covered by the policy.
(8)

ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | REVOCATION OF ACCESS AUTHORIZATIONS

The information system enforces the revocation of access authorizations resulting from changes
to the security attributes of subjects and objects based on [Assignment: organization-defined rules
governing the timing of revocations of access authorizations].
Supplemental Guidance: Revocation of access rules may differ based on the types of access
revoked. For example, if a subject (i.e., user or process) is removed from a group, access may
not be revoked until the next time the object (e.g., file) is opened or until the next time the
subject attempts a new access to the object. Revocation based on changes to security labels
may take effect immediately. Organizations can provide alternative approaches on how to
make revocations immediate if information systems cannot provide such capability and
immediate revocation is necessary.
(9)

ACCESS ENFORCEMENT | CONTROLLED RELEASE

The information system does not release information outside of the established system boundary
unless:
(a)

The receiving [Assignment: organization-defined information system or system component]
provides [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards]; and

(b) [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] are used to validate the
appropriateness of the information designated for release.
Supplemental Guidance: Information systems can only protect organizational information

within the confines of established system boundaries. Additional security safeguards may be
needed to ensure that such information is adequately protected once it is passed beyond the
established information system boundaries. Examples of information leaving the system
boundary include transmitting information to an external information system or printing the
information on one of its printers. In cases where the information system is unable to make a
determination of the adequacy of the protections provided by entities outside its boundary, as
a mitigating control, organizations determine procedurally whether the external information
systems are providing adequate security. The means used to determine the adequacy of the
security provided by external information systems include, for example, conducting
inspections or periodic testing, establishing agreements between the organization and its
counterpart organizations, or some other process. The means used by external entities to
protect the information received need not be the same as those used by the organization, but
the means employed are sufficient to provide consistent adjudication of the security policy to
protect the information. This control enhancement requires information systems to employ
technical or procedural means to validate the information prior to releasing it to external
systems. For example, if the information system passes information to another system
controlled by another organization, technical means are employed to validate that the security
attributes associated with the exported information are appropriate for the receiving system.
Alternatively, if the information system passes information to a printer in organizationcontrolled space, procedural means can be employed to ensure that only appropriately
authorized individuals gain access to the printer. This control enhancement is most applicable
when there is some policy mandate (e.g., law, Executive Order, directive, or regulation) that
establishes policy regarding access to the information, and that policy applies beyond the
realm of a particular information system or organization.

INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT
Control: The information system enforces approved authorizations for controlling the flow of

information within the system and between interconnected systems based on [Assignment:
organization-defined information flow control policies].
Supplemental Guidance: Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel

within an information system and between information systems (as opposed to who is allowed to
access the information) and without explicit regard to subsequent accesses to that information.
Flow control restrictions include, for example, keeping export-controlled information from being
transmitted in the clear to the Internet, blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within the
organization, restricting web requests to the Internet that are not from the internal web proxy
server, and limiting information transfers between organizations based on data structures and
content. Transferring information between information systems representing different security
domains with different security policies introduces risk that such transfers violate one or more
domain security policies. In such situations, information owners/stewards provide guidance at
designated policy enforcement points between interconnected systems. Organizations consider
mandating specific architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security policies.
Enforcement includes, for example: (i) prohibiting information transfers between interconnected
systems (i.e., allowing access only); (ii) employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way
information flows; and (iii) implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security
attributes and security labels.
Organizations commonly employ information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms
to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks,
individuals, and devices) within information systems and between interconnected systems. Flow
control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path. Enforcement
occurs, for example, in boundary protection devices (e.g., gateways, routers, guards, encrypted
tunnels, firewalls) that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict information
system services, provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or messagefiltering capability based on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using
document characteristics). Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering/inspection
mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical to information
flow enforcement. Control enhancements 3 through 22 primarily address cross-domain solution
needs which focus on more advanced filtering techniques, in-depth analysis, and stronger flow
enforcement mechanisms implemented in cross-domain products, for example, high-assurance
guards. Such capabilities are generally not available in commercial off-the-shelf information
technology products. Related controls: AC-3, AC-17, AC-19, AC-21, CM-6, CM-7, SA-8, SC-2,
SC-5, SC-7, SC-18.
Control Enhancements:
(1)

INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | OBJECT SECURITY ATTRIBUTES

The information system uses [Assignment: organization-defined security attributes] associated
with [Assignment: organization-defined information, source, and destination objects] to enforce
[Assignment: organization-defined information flow control policies] as a basis for flow control
decisions.
Supplemental Guidance: Information flow enforcement mechanisms compare security attributes

associated with information (data content and data structure) and source/destination objects,
and respond appropriately (e.g., block, quarantine, alert administrator) when the mechanisms
encounter information flows not explicitly allowed by information flow policies. For example,
an information object labeled Secret would be allowed to flow to a destination object labeled
Secret, but an information object labeled Top Secret would not be allowed to flow to a

APPENDIX F-AC

destination object labeled Secret. Security attributes can also include, for example, source and
destination addresses employed in traffic filter firewalls. Flow enforcement using explicit
security attributes can be used, for example, to control the release of certain types of
information. Related control: AC-16.
(2)

INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | PROCESSING DOMAINS

The information system uses protected processing domains to enforce [Assignment: organizationdefined information flow control policies] as a basis for flow control decisions.
Supplemental Guidance: Within information systems, protected processing domains are
processing spaces that have controlled interactions with other processing spaces, thus
enabling control of information flows between these spaces and to/from data/information
objects. A protected processing domain can be provided, for example, by implementing
domain and type enforcement. In domain and type enforcement, information system processes
are assigned to domains; information is identified by types; and information flows are
controlled based on allowed information accesses (determined by domain and type), allowed
signaling among domains, and allowed process transitions to other domains.
(3)

INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | DYNAMIC INFORMATION FLOW CONTROL

The information system enforces dynamic information flow control based on [Assignment:
organization-defined policies].
Supplemental Guidance: Organizational policies regarding dynamic information flow control
include, for example, allowing or disallowing information flows based on changing conditions
or mission/operational considerations. Changing conditions include, for example, changes in
organizational risk tolerance due to changes in the immediacy of mission/business needs,
changes in the threat environment, and detection of potentially harmful or adverse events.
Related control: SI-4.
(4)

INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | CONTENT CHECK ENCRYPTED INFORMATION

The information system prevents encrypted information from bypassing content-checking
mechanisms by [Selection (one or more): decrypting the information; blocking the flow of the
encrypted information; terminating communications sessions attempting to pass encrypted
information; [Assignment: organization-defined procedure or method]].
Supplemental Guidance: Related control: SI-4.
(5)

INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | EMBEDDED DATA TYPES

The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined limitations] on embedding
data types within other data types.
Supplemental Guidance: Embedding data types within other data types may result in reduced
flow control effectiveness. Data type embedding includes, for example, inserting executable
files as objects within word processing files, inserting references or descriptive information
into a media file, and compressed or archived data types that may include multiple embedded
data types. Limitations on data type embedding consider the levels of embedding and prohibit
levels of data type embedding that are beyond the capability of the inspection tools.
(6)

INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | METADATA

The information system enforces information flow control based on [Assignment: organizationdefined metadata].
Supplemental Guidance: Metadata is information used to describe the characteristics of data.
Metadata can include structural metadata describing data structures (e.g., data format, syntax,
and semantics) or descriptive metadata describing data contents (e.g., age, location, telephone
number). Enforcing allowed information flows based on metadata enables simpler and more
effective flow control. Organizations consider the trustworthiness of metadata with regard to
data accuracy (i.e., knowledge that the metadata values are correct with respect to the data),
data integrity (i.e., protecting against unauthorized changes to metadata tags), and the binding
of metadata to the data payload (i.e., ensuring sufficiently strong binding techniques with
appropriate levels of assurance). Related controls: AC-16, SI-7.
(7)

INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | ONE-WAY FLOW MECHANISMS

The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined one-way information flows]
using hardware mechanisms.

(8)

INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | SECURITY POLICY FILTERS

The information system enforces information flow control using [Assignment: organization-defined
security policy filters] as a basis for flow control decisions for [Assignment: organization-defined
information flows].
Supplemental Guidance: Organization-defined security policy filters can address data structures

and content. For example, security policy filters for data structures can check for maximum
file lengths, maximum field sizes, and data/file types (for structured and unstructured data).
Security policy filters for data content can check for specific words (e.g., dirty/clean word
filters), enumerated values or data value ranges, and hidden content. Structured data permits
the interpretation of data content by applications. Unstructured data typically refers to digital
information without a particular data structure or with a data structure that does not facilitate
the development of rule sets to address the particular sensitivity of the information conveyed
by the data or the associated flow enforcement decisions. Unstructured data consists of: (i)
bitmap objects that are inherently non language-based (i.e., image, video, or audio files); and
(ii) textual objects that are based on written or printed languages (e.g., commercial off-theshelf word processing documents, spreadsheets, or emails). Organizations can implement
more than one security policy filter to meet information flow control objectives (e.g.,
employing clean word lists in conjunction with dirty word lists may help to reduce false
positives).
(9)

INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | HUMAN REVIEWS

The information system enforces the use of human reviews for [Assignment: organization-defined
information flows] under the following conditions: [Assignment: organization-defined conditions].
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations define security policy filters for all situations where
automated flow control decisions are possible. When a fully automated flow control decision
is not possible, then a human review may be employed in lieu of, or as a complement to,
automated security policy filtering. Human reviews may also be employed as deemed
necessary by organizations.
(10) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | ENABLE / DISABLE SECURITY POLICY FILTERS
The information system provides the capability for privileged administrators to enable/disable
[Assignment: organization-defined security policy filters] under the following conditions:
[Assignment: organization-defined conditions].
Supplemental Guidance: For example, as allowed by the information system authorization,
administrators can enable security policy filters to accommodate approved data types.
(11) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | CONFIGURATION OF SECURITY POLICY FILTERS
The information system provides the capability for privileged administrators to configure
[Assignment: organization-defined security policy filters] to support different security policies.
Supplemental Guidance: For example, to reflect changes in security policies, administrators can
change the list of “dirty words” that security policy mechanisms check in accordance with the
definitions provided by organizations.
(12) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | DATA TYPE IDENTIFIERS
The information system, when transferring information between different security domains, uses
[Assignment: organization-defined data type identifiers] to validate data essential for information
flow decisions.
Supplemental Guidance: Data type identifiers include, for example, filenames, file types, file
signatures/tokens, and multiple internal file signatures/tokens. Information systems may allow
transfer of data only if compliant with data type format specifications.
(13) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | DECOMPOSITION INTO POLICY-RELEVANT SUBCOMPONENTS
The information system, when transferring information between different security domains,
decomposes information into [Assignment: organization-defined policy-relevant subcomponents]
for submission to policy enforcement mechanisms.
Supplemental Guidance: Policy enforcement mechanisms apply filtering, inspection, and/or
sanitization rules to the policy-relevant subcomponents of information to facilitate flow
enforcement prior to transferring such information to different security domains. Parsing
transfer files facilitates policy decisions on source, destination, certificates, classification,
attachments, and other security-related component differentiators.

________________________________________________________________________________________________
(14) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | SECURITY POLICY FILTER CONSTRAINTS
The information system, when transferring information between different security domains,
implements [Assignment: organization-defined security policy filters] requiring fully enumerated
formats that restrict data structure and content.
Supplemental Guidance: Data structure and content restrictions reduce the range of potential
malicious and/or unsanctioned content in cross-domain transactions. Security policy filters
that restrict data structures include, for example, restricting file sizes and field lengths. Data
content policy filters include, for example: (i) encoding formats for character sets (e.g.,
Universal Character Set Transformation Formats, American Standard Code for Information
Interchange); (ii) restricting character data fields to only contain alpha-numeric characters;
(iii) prohibiting special characters; and (iv) validating schema structures.
(15) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | DETECTION OF UNSANCTIONED INFORMATION
The information system, when transferring information between different security domains,
examines the information for the presence of [Assignment: organized-defined unsanctioned
information] and prohibits the transfer of such information in accordance with the [Assignment:
organization-defined security policy].
Supplemental Guidance: Detection of unsanctioned information includes, for example, checking
all information to be transferred for malicious code and dirty words. Related control: SI-3.
(16) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | INFORMATION TRANSFERS ON INTERCONNECTED SYSTEMS
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AC-4].
(17) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | DOMAIN AUTHENTICATION
The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates source and destination points by
[Selection (one or more): organization, system, application, individual] for information transfer.
Supplemental Guidance: Attribution is a critical component of a security concept of operations.
The ability to identify source and destination points for information flowing in information
systems, allows the forensic reconstruction of events when required, and encourages policy
compliance by attributing policy violations to specific organizations/individuals. Successful
domain authentication requires that information system labels distinguish among systems,
organizations, and individuals involved in preparing, sending, receiving, or disseminating
information. Related controls: IA-2, IA-3, IA-4, IA-5.
(18) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | SECURITY ATTRIBUTE BINDING
The information system binds security attributes to information using [Assignment: organizationdefined binding techniques] to facilitate information flow policy enforcement.
Supplemental Guidance: Binding techniques implemented by information systems affect the
strength of security attribute binding to information. Binding strength and the assurance
associated with binding techniques play an important part in the trust organizations have in
the information flow enforcement process. The binding techniques affect the number and
degree of additional reviews required by organizations. Related controls: AC-16, SC-16.
(19) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | VALIDATION OF METADATA
The information system, when transferring information between different security domains, applies
the same security policy filtering to metadata as it applies to data payloads.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement requires the validation of metadata and the
data to which the metadata applies. Some organizations distinguish between metadata and
data payloads (i.e., only the data to which the metadata is bound). Other organizations do not
make such distinctions, considering metadata and the data to which the metadata applies as
part of the payload. All information (including metadata and the data to which the metadata
applies) is subject to filtering and inspection.
(20) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | APPROVED SOLUTIONS
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined solutions in approved
configurations] to control the flow of [Assignment: organization-defined information] across
security domains.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations define approved solutions and configurations in crossdomain policies and guidance in accordance with the types of information flows across

APPENDIX F-AC

classification boundaries. The Unified Cross Domain Management Office (UCDMO)
provides a baseline listing of approved cross-domain solutions.
(21) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | PHYSICAL / LOGICAL SEPARATION OF INFORMATION FLOWS
The information system separates information flows logically or physically using [Assignment:
organization-defined mechanisms and/or techniques] to accomplish [Assignment: organizationdefined required separations by types of information].
Supplemental Guidance: Enforcing the separation of information flows by type can enhance

protection by ensuring that information is not commingled while in transit and by enabling
flow control by transmission paths perhaps not otherwise achievable. Types of separable
information include, for example, inbound and outbound communications traffic, service
requests and responses, and information of differing security categories.
(22) INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT | ACCESS ONLY
The information system provides access from a single device to computing platforms,
applications, or data residing on multiple different security domains, while preventing any
information flow between the different security domains.
Supplemental Guidance: The information system, for example, provides a desktop for users to
access each connected security domain without providing any mechanisms to allow transfer
of information between the different security domains.

Defines information system access authorizations to support separation of duties.

Supplemental Guidance: Separation of duties addresses the potential for abuse of authorized

privileges and helps to reduce the risk of malevolent activity without collusion. Separation of
duties includes, for example: (i) dividing mission functions and information system support
functions among different individuals and/or roles; (ii) conducting information system support
functions with different individuals (e.g., system management, programming, configuration
management, quality assurance and testing, and network security); and (iii) ensuring security
personnel administering access control functions do not also administer audit functions. Related

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations employ least privilege for specific duties and information

systems. The principle of least privilege is also applied to information system processes, ensuring
that the processes operate at privilege levels no higher than necessary to accomplish required
organizational missions/business functions. Organizations consider the creation of additional
processes, roles, and information system accounts as necessary, to achieve least privilege.
Organizations also apply least privilege to the development, implementation, and operation of
organizational information systems. Related controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-5, CM-6, CM-7, PL-2.
Control Enhancements:
(1)

LEAST PRIVILEGE | AUTHORIZE ACCESS TO SECURITY FUNCTIONS

The organization explicitly authorizes access to [Assignment: organization-defined security
functions (deployed in hardware, software, and firmware) and security-relevant information].
Supplemental Guidance: Security functions include, for example, establishing system accounts,

configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting events to be audited,
and setting intrusion detection parameters. Security-relevant information includes, for
example, filtering rules for routers/firewalls, cryptographic key management information,
configuration parameters for security services, and access control lists. Explicitly authorized
personnel include, for example, security administrators, system and network administrators,
system security officers, system maintenance personnel, system programmers, and other
privileged users. Related controls: AC-17, AC-18, AC-19.
(2)

LEAST PRIVILEGE | NON-PRIVILEGED ACCESS FOR NONSECURITY FUNCTIONS

The organization requires that users of information system accounts, or roles, with access to
[Assignment: organization-defined security functions or security-relevant information], use nonprivileged accounts or roles, when accessing nonsecurity functions.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement limits exposure when operating from within
privileged accounts or roles. The inclusion of roles addresses situations where organizations
implement access control policies such as role-based access control and where a change of
role provides the same degree of assurance in the change of access authorizations for both the
user and all processes acting on behalf of the user as would be provided by a change between
a privileged and non-privileged account. Related control: PL-4.
(3)

LEAST PRIVILEGE | NETWORK ACCESS TO PRIVILEGED COMMANDS

The organization authorizes network access to [Assignment: organization-defined privileged
commands] only for [Assignment: organization-defined compelling operational needs] and
documents the rationale for such access in the security plan for the information system.
Supplemental Guidance: Network access is any access across a network connection in lieu of

local access (i.e., user being physically present at the device). Related control: AC-17.
(4)

LEAST PRIVILEGE | SEPARATE PROCESSING DOMAINS

The information system provides separate processing domains to enable finer-grained allocation
of user privileges.
Supplemental Guidance: Providing separate processing domains for finer-grained allocation of
user privileges includes, for example: (i) using virtualization techniques to allow additional
privileges within a virtual machine while restricting privileges to other virtual machines or to
the underlying actual machine; (ii) employing hardware and/or software domain separation
mechanisms; and (iii) implementing separate physical domains. Related controls: AC-4, SC-3,
SC-30, SC-32.
(5)

LEAST PRIVILEGE | PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS

The organization restricts privileged accounts on the information system to [Assignment:
organization-defined personnel or roles].
Supplemental Guidance: Privileged accounts, including super user accounts, are typically
described as system administrator for various types of commercial off-the-shelf operating
systems. Restricting privileged accounts to specific personnel or roles prevents day-to-day
users from having access to privileged information/functions. Organizations may differentiate
in the application of this control enhancement between allowed privileges for local accounts
and for domain accounts provided organizations retain the ability to control information

LEAST PRIVILEGE | PRIVILEGED ACCESS BY NON-ORGANIZATIONAL USERS

The organization prohibits privileged access to the information system by non-organizational
users.
Supplemental Guidance: Related control: IA-8.
(7)

LEAST PRIVILEGE | REVIEW OF USER PRIVILEGES

The organization:
(a)

Reviews [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] the privileges assigned to
[Assignment: organization-defined roles or classes of users] to validate the need for such
privileges; and

(b) Reassigns or removes privileges, if necessary, to correctly reflect organizational
mission/business needs.
Supplemental Guidance: The need for certain assigned user privileges may change over time
reflecting changes in organizational missions/business function, environments of operation,
technologies, or threat. Periodic review of assigned user privileges is necessary to determine if
the rationale for assigning such privileges remains valid. If the need cannot be revalidated,
organizations take appropriate corrective actions. Related control: CA-7.
(8)

LEAST PRIVILEGE | PRIVILEGE LEVELS FOR CODE EXECUTION

The information system prevents [Assignment: organization-defined software] from executing at
higher privilege levels than users executing the software.
Supplemental Guidance: In certain situations, software applications/programs need to execute
with elevated privileges to perform required functions. However, if the privileges required for
execution are at a higher level than the privileges assigned to organizational users invoking
such applications/programs, those users are indirectly provided with greater privileges than
assigned by organizations.
(9)

LEAST PRIVILEGE | AUDITING USE OF PRIVILEGED FUNCTIONS

The information system audits the execution of privileged functions.
Supplemental Guidance: Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally
by authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised information
system accounts, is a serious and ongoing concern and can have significant adverse impacts
on organizations. Auditing the use of privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse,
and in doing so, help mitigate the risk from insider threats and the advanced persistent threat
(APT). Related control: AU-2.
(10) LEAST PRIVILEGE | PROHIBIT NON-PRIVILEGED USERS FROM EXECUTING PRIVILEGED FUNCTIONS
The information system prevents non-privileged users from executing privileged functions to
include disabling, circumventing, or altering implemented security safeguards/countermeasures.
Supplemental Guidance: Privileged functions include, for example, establishing information
system accounts, performing system integrity checks, or administering cryptographic key
management activities. Non-privileged users are individuals that do not possess appropriate
authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious
code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection from
non-privileged users.

UNSUCCESSFUL LOGON ATTEMPTS
Control: The information system:

a.

Enforces a limit of [Assignment: organization-defined number] consecutive invalid logon
attempts by a user during a [Assignment: organization-defined time period]; and

b.

Automatically [Selection: locks the account/node for an [Assignment: organization-defined

prompt according to [Assignment: organization-defined delay algorithm]] when the
maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded.

Supplemental Guidance: This control applies regardless of whether the logon occurs via a local or

network connection. Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts initiated by
information systems are usually temporary and automatically release after a predetermined time
period established by organizations. If a delay algorithm is selected, organizations may choose to
employ different algorithms for different information system components based on the capabilities
of those components. Responses to unsuccessful logon attempts may be implemented at both the
operating system and the application levels. Related controls: AC-2, AC-9, AC-14, IA-5.

The information system purges/wipes information from [Assignment: organization-defined mobile
devices] based on [Assignment: organization-defined purging/wiping requirements/techniques]

attempts.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement applies only to mobile devices for which a
logon occurs (e.g., personal digital assistants, smart phones, tablets). The logon is to the
mobile device, not to any one account on the device. Therefore, successful logons to any
accounts on mobile devices reset the unsuccessful logon count to zero. Organizations define
information to be purged/wiped carefully in order to avoid over purging/wiping which may
result in devices becoming unusable. Purging/wiping may be unnecessary if the information
on the device is protected with sufficiently strong encryption mechanisms. Related controls:

banners displayed before individuals log in to information systems. System use notifications are
used only for access via logon interfaces with human users and are not required when such human
interfaces do not exist. Organizations consider system use notification messages/banners displayed
in multiple languages based on specific organizational needs and the demographics of information
system users. Organizations also consult with the Office of the General Counsel for legal review

Supplemental Guidance: Session locks are temporary actions taken when users stop work and move

away from the immediate vicinity of information systems but do not want to log out because of the
temporary nature of their absences. Session locks are implemented where session activities can be
determined. This is typically at the operating system level, but can also be at the application level.

communications sessions (i.e., network disconnect). A logical session (for local, network, and
remote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an
organizational information system. Such user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate user
access) without terminating network sessions. Session termination terminates all processes
associated with a user’s logical session except those processes that are specifically created by the
user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated. Conditions or trigger events
requiring automatic session termination can include, for example, organization-defined periods of

The information system:
(a)

Provides a logout capability for user-initiated communications sessions whenever
authentication is used to gain access to [Assignment: organization-defined information
resources]; and

(b) Displays an explicit logout message to users indicating the reliable termination of
authenticated communications sessions.
Supplemental Guidance: Information resources to which users gain access via authentication
include, for example, local workstations, databases, and password-protected websites/webbased services. Logout messages for web page access, for example, can be displayed after
authenticated sessions have been terminated. However, for some types of interactive sessions
including, for example, file transfer protocol (FTP) sessions, information systems typically
send logout messages as final messages prior to terminating sessions.

b.

Documents and provides supporting rationale in the security plan for the information system,
user actions not requiring identification or authentication.

Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses situations in which organizations determine that no

identification or authentication is required in organizational information systems. Organizations
may allow a limited number of user actions without identification or authentication including, for
example, when individuals access public websites or other publicly accessible federal information
systems, when individuals use mobile phones to receive calls, or when facsimiles are received.
Organizations also identify actions that normally require identification or authentication but may
under certain circumstances (e.g., emergencies), allow identification or authentication mechanisms
to be bypassed. Such bypasses may occur, for example, via a software-readable physical switch
that commands bypass of the logon functionality and is protected from accidental or unmonitored
use. This control does not apply to situations where identification and authentication have already
occurred and are not repeated, but rather to situations where identification and authentication have
not yet occurred. Organizations may decide that there are no user actions that can be performed on
organizational information systems without identification and authentication and thus, the values
for assignment statements can be none. Related controls: CP-2, IA-2.

SECURITY ATTRIBUTES
Control: The organization:

a.

Provides the means to associate [Assignment: organization-defined types of security
attributes] having [Assignment: organization-defined security attribute values] with
information in storage, in process, and/or in transmission;

b.

Ensures that the security attribute associations are made and retained with the information;

c.

Establishes the permitted [Assignment: organization-defined security attributes] for
[Assignment: organization-defined information systems]; and

d.

Determines the permitted [Assignment: organization-defined values or ranges] for each of the
established security attributes.

Supplemental Guidance: Information is represented internally within information systems using

abstractions known as data structures. Internal data structures can represent different types of
entities, both active and passive. Active entities, also known as subjects, are typically associated
with individuals, devices, or processes acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known
as objects, are typically associated with data structures such as records, buffers, tables, files, interprocess pipes, and communications ports. Security attributes, a form of metadata, are abstractions
representing the basic properties or characteristics of active and passive entities with respect to
safeguarding information. These attributes may be associated with active entities (i.e., subjects)
that have the potential to send or receive information, to cause information to flow among objects,

APPENDIX F-AC

PAGE F-25

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

or to change the information system state. These attributes may also be associated with passive
entities (i.e., objects) that contain or receive information. The association of security attributes to
subjects and objects is referred to as binding and is typically inclusive of setting the attribute value
and the attribute type. Security attributes when bound to data/information, enables the enforcement
of information security policies for access control and information flow control, either through
organizational processes or information system functions or mechanisms. The content or assigned
values of security attributes can directly affect the ability of individuals to access organizational
information.
Organizations can define the types of attributes needed for selected information systems to support
missions/business functions. There is potentially a wide range of values that can be assigned to
any given security attribute. Release markings could include, for example, US only, NATO, or
NOFORN (not releasable to foreign nationals). By specifying permitted attribute ranges and
values, organizations can ensure that the security attribute values are meaningful and relevant. The
term security labeling refers to the association of security attributes with subjects and objects
represented by internal data structures within organizational information systems, to enable
information system-based enforcement of information security policies. Security labels include,
for example, access authorizations, data life cycle protection (i.e., encryption and data expiration),
nationality, affiliation as contractor, and classification of information in accordance with legal and
compliance requirements. The term security marking refers to the association of security attributes
with objects in a human-readable form, to enable organizational process-based enforcement of
information security policies. The AC-16 base control represents the requirement for user-based
attribute association (marking). The enhancements to AC-16 represent additional requirements
including information system-based attribute association (labeling). Types of attributes include,
for example, classification level for objects and clearance (access authorization) level for subjects.
An example of a value for both of these attribute types is Top Secret. Related controls: AC-3, AC4, AC-6, AC-21, AU-2, AU-10, SC-16, MP-3.
Control Enhancements:
(1)

SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | DYNAMIC ATTRIBUTE ASSOCIATION

The information system dynamically associates security attributes with [Assignment: organizationdefined subjects and objects] in accordance with [Assignment: organization-defined security
policies] as information is created and combined.
Supplemental Guidance: Dynamic association of security attributes is appropriate whenever the

security characteristics of information changes over time. Security attributes may change, for
example, due to information aggregation issues (i.e., the security characteristics of individual
information elements are different from the combined elements), changes in individual access
authorizations (i.e., privileges), and changes in the security category of information. Related
control: AC-4.
(2)

SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | ATTRIBUTE VALUE CHANGES BY AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS

The information system provides authorized individuals (or processes acting on behalf of
individuals) the capability to define or change the value of associated security attributes.
Supplemental Guidance: The content or assigned values of security attributes can directly affect
the ability of individuals to access organizational information. Therefore, it is important for
information systems to be able to limit the ability to create or modify security attributes to
authorized individuals. Related controls: AC-6, AU-2.
(3)

SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | MAINTENANCE OF ATTRIBUTE ASSOCIATIONS BY INFORMATION SYSTEM

The information system maintains the association and integrity of [Assignment: organizationdefined security attributes] to [Assignment: organization-defined subjects and objects].
Supplemental Guidance: Maintaining the association and integrity of security attributes to
subjects and objects with sufficient assurance helps to ensure that the attribute associations
can be used as the basis of automated policy actions. Automated policy actions include, for
example, access control decisions or information flow control decisions.

SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | ASSOCIATION OF ATTRIBUTES BY AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS

The information system supports the association of [Assignment: organization-defined security
attributes] with [Assignment: organization-defined subjects and objects] by authorized individuals
(or processes acting on behalf of individuals).
Supplemental Guidance: The support provided by information systems can vary to include: (i)
prompting users to select specific security attributes to be associated with specific information
objects; (ii) employing automated mechanisms for categorizing information with appropriate
attributes based on defined policies; or (iii) ensuring that the combination of selected security
attributes selected is valid. Organizations consider the creation, deletion, or modification of
security attributes when defining auditable events.
(5)

SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | ATTRIBUTE DISPLAYS FOR OUTPUT DEVICES

The information system displays security attributes in human-readable form on each object that
the system transmits to output devices to identify [Assignment: organization-identified special
dissemination, handling, or distribution instructions] using [Assignment: organization-identified
human-readable, standard naming conventions].
Supplemental Guidance: Information system outputs include, for example, pages, screens, or

equivalent. Information system output devices include, for example, printers and video
displays on computer workstations, notebook computers, and personal digital assistants.
(6)

SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | MAINTENANCE OF ATTRIBUTE ASSOCIATION BY ORGANIZATION

The organization allows personnel to associate, and maintain the association of [Assignment:
organization-defined security attributes] with [Assignment: organization-defined subjects and
objects] in accordance with [Assignment: organization-defined security policies].
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement requires individual users (as opposed to the

information system) to maintain associations of security attributes with subjects and objects.
(7)

SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | CONSISTENT ATTRIBUTE INTERPRETATION
The organization provides a consistent interpretation of security attributes transmitted between
distributed information system components.

Supplemental Guidance: In order to enforce security policies across multiple components in

distributed information systems (e.g., distributed database management systems, cloud-based
systems, and service-oriented architectures), organizations provide a consistent interpretation
of security attributes that are used in access enforcement and flow enforcement decisions.
Organizations establish agreements and processes to ensure that all distributed information
system components implement security attributes with consistent interpretations in automated
access/flow enforcement actions.
(8)

SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | ASSOCIATION TECHNIQUES / TECHNOLOGIES

The information system implements [Assignment: organization-defined techniques or
technologies] with [Assignment: organization-defined level of assurance] in associating security
attributes to information.
Supplemental Guidance: The association (i.e., binding) of security attributes to information
within information systems is of significant importance with regard to conducting automated
access enforcement and flow enforcement actions. The association of such security attributes
can be accomplished with technologies/techniques providing different levels of assurance. For
example, information systems can cryptographically bind security attributes to information
using digital signatures with the supporting cryptographic keys protected by hardware devices
(sometimes known as hardware roots of trust).
(9)

SECURITY ATTRIBUTES | ATTRIBUTE REASSIGNMENT

The organization ensures that security attributes associated with information are reassigned only
via re-grading mechanisms validated using [Assignment: organization-defined techniques or
procedures].
Supplemental Guidance: Validated re-grading mechanisms are employed by organizations to
provide the requisite levels of assurance for security attribute reassignment activities. The
validation is facilitated by ensuring that re-grading mechanisms are single purpose and of
limited function. Since security attribute reassignments can affect security policy enforcement
actions (e.g., access/flow enforcement decisions), using trustworthy re-grading mechanisms is
necessary to ensure that such mechanisms perform in a consistent/correct mode of operation.

REMOTE ACCESS
Control: The organization:

a.

Establishes and documents usage restrictions, configuration/connection requirements, and
implementation guidance for each type of remote access allowed; and

b.

Authorizes remote access to the information system prior to allowing such connections.

Supplemental Guidance: Remote access is access to organizational information systems by users (or

processes acting on behalf of users) communicating through external networks (e.g., the Internet).
Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations
often employ encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity
over remote connections. The use of encrypted VPNs does not make the access non-remote;
however, the use of VPNs, when adequately provisioned with appropriate security controls (e.g.,
employing appropriate encryption techniques for confidentiality and integrity protection) may
provide sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat such connections as
internal networks. Still, VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN
does not enhance the availability of remote connections. Also, VPNs with encrypted tunnels can
affect the organizational capability to adequately monitor network communications traffic for
malicious code. Remote access controls apply to information systems other than public web
servers or systems designed for public access. This control addresses authorization prior to
allowing remote access without specifying the formats for such authorization. While organizations
may use interconnection security agreements to authorize remote access connections, such
agreements are not required by this control. Enforcing access restrictions for remote connections is
addressed in AC-3. Related controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-18, AC-19, AC-20, CA-3, CA-7, CM-8,

further remote access. The speed of disconnect or disablement varies based on the criticality
of missions/business functions and the need to eliminate immediate or future remote access to
organizational information systems.

WIRELESS ACCESS | ANTENNAS / TRANSMISSION POWER LEVELS

The organization selects radio antennas and calibrates transmission power levels to reduce the
probability that usable signals can be received outside of organization-controlled boundaries.
Supplemental Guidance: Actions that may be taken by organizations to limit unauthorized use
of wireless communications outside of organization-controlled boundaries include, for
example: (i) reducing the power of wireless transmissions so that the transmissions are less
likely to emit a signal that can be used by adversaries outside of the physical perimeters of
organizations; (ii) employing measures such as TEMPEST to control wireless emanations;
and (iii) using directional/beam forming antennas that reduce the likelihood that unintended
receivers will be able to intercept signals. Prior to taking such actions, organizations can
conduct periodic wireless surveys to understand the radio frequency profile of organizational
information systems as well as other systems that may be operating in the area. Related

ACCESS CONTROL FOR MOBILE DEVICES
Control: The organization:

a.

Establishes usage restrictions, configuration requirements, connection requirements, and
implementation guidance for organization-controlled mobile devices; and

b.

Authorizes the connection of mobile devices to organizational information systems.

Supplemental Guidance: A mobile device is a computing device that: (i) has a small form factor

such that it can easily be carried by a single individual; (ii) is designed to operate without a
physical connection (e.g., wirelessly transmit or receive information); (iii) possesses local, nonremovable or removable data storage; and (iv) includes a self-contained power source. Mobile
devices may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the device
to capture information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations.
Examples include smart phones, E-readers, and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated
with a single individual and the device is usually in close proximity to the individual; however, the
degree of proximity can vary depending upon on the form factor and size of the device. The

processing, storage, and transmission capability of the mobile device may be comparable to or
merely a subset of desktop systems, depending upon the nature and intended purpose of the
device. Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different technical characteristics and
capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes/types of such devices.
Usage restrictions and specific implementation guidance for mobile devices include, for example,
configuration management, device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory
protective software (e.g., malicious code detection, firewall), scanning devices for malicious code,
updating virus protection software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting
primary operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling
unnecessary hardware (e.g., wireless, infrared). Organizations are cautioned that the need to
provide adequate security for mobile devices goes beyond the requirements in this control. Many
safeguards and countermeasures for mobile devices are reflected in other security controls in the
catalog allocated in the initial control baselines as starting points for the development of security
plans and overlays using the tailoring process. There may also be some degree of overlap in the
requirements articulated by the security controls within the different families of controls. AC-20

USE OF EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS
Control: The organization establishes terms and conditions, consistent with any trust relationships

established with other organizations owning, operating, and/or maintaining external information
systems, allowing authorized individuals to:
a.

Access the information system from external information systems; and

b.

Process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information using external information
systems.

Supplemental Guidance: External information systems are information systems or components of

information systems that are outside of the authorization boundary established by organizations
and for which organizations typically have no direct supervision and authority over the application
of required security controls or the assessment of control effectiveness. External information
systems include, for example: (i) personally owned information systems/devices (e.g., notebook
computers, smart phones, tablets, personal digital assistants); (ii) privately owned computing and
communications devices resident in commercial or public facilities (e.g., hotels, train stations,
convention centers, shopping malls, or airports); (iii) information systems owned or controlled by
nonfederal governmental organizations; and (iv) federal information systems that are not owned
by, operated by, or under the direct supervision and authority of organizations. This control also
addresses the use of external information systems for the processing, storage, or transmission of
organizational information, including, for example, accessing cloud services (e.g., infrastructure as
a service, platform as a service, or software as a service) from organizational information systems.
For some external information systems (i.e., information systems operated by other federal
agencies, including organizations subordinate to those agencies), the trust relationships that have
been established between those organizations and the originating organization may be such, that
no explicit terms and conditions are required. Information systems within these organizations
would not be considered external. These situations occur when, for example, there are pre-existing
sharing/trust agreements (either implicit or explicit) established between federal agencies or
organizations subordinate to those agencies, or when such trust agreements are specified by
applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, or policies. Authorized individuals include, for
example, organizational personnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to
organizational information systems and over which organizations have the authority to impose
rules of behavior with regard to system access. Restrictions that organizations impose on
authorized individuals need not be uniform, as those restrictions may vary depending upon the
trust relationships between organizations. Therefore, organizations may choose to impose different
security restrictions on contractors than on state, local, or tribal governments.
This control does not apply to the use of external information systems to access public interfaces
to organizational information systems (e.g., individuals accessing federal information through
www.usa.gov). Organizations establish terms and conditions for the use of external information
systems in accordance with organizational security policies and procedures. Terms and conditions
address as a minimum: types of applications that can be accessed on organizational information
systems from external information systems; and the highest security category of information that
can be processed, stored, or transmitted on external information systems. If terms and conditions
with the owners of external information systems cannot be established, organizations may impose
restrictions on organizational personnel using those external systems. Related controls: AC-3, AC17, AC-19, CA-3, PL-4, SA-9.

Control Enhancements:
(1)

USE OF EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | LIMITS ON AUTHORIZED USE
The organization permits authorized individuals to use an external information system to access
the information system or to process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information only
when the organization:

(a)

Verifies the implementation of required security controls on the external system as specified
in the organization’s information security policy and security plan; or

(b) Retains approved information system connection or processing agreements with the
organizational entity hosting the external information system.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement recognizes that there are circumstances
where individuals using external information systems (e.g., contractors, coalition partners)
need to access organizational information systems. In those situations, organizations need
confidence that the external information systems contain the necessary security safeguards
(i.e., security controls), so as not to compromise, damage, or otherwise harm organizational
information systems. Verification that the required security controls have been implemented
can be achieved, for example, by third-party, independent assessments, attestations, or other
means, depending on the confidence level required by organizations. Related control: CA-2.
(2)

USE OF EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | PORTABLE STORAGE DEVICES
The organization [Selection: restricts; prohibits] the use of organization-controlled portable
storage devices by authorized individuals on external information systems.

Supplemental Guidance: Limits on the use of organization-controlled portable storage devices
in external information systems include, for example, complete prohibition of the use of such
devices or restrictions on how the devices may be used and under what conditions the devices
may be used.
(3)

USE OF EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | NON-ORGANIZATIONALLY OWNED SYSTEMS / COMPONENTS / DEVICES
The organization [Selection: restricts; prohibits] the use of non-organizationally owned information
systems, system components, or devices to process, store, or transmit organizational information.

Supplemental Guidance: Non-organizationally owned devices include devices owned by other
organizations (e.g., federal/state agencies, contractors) and personally owned devices. There
are risks to using non-organizationally owned devices. In some cases, the risk is sufficiently
high as to prohibit such use. In other cases, it may be such that the use of non-organizationally
owned devices is allowed but restricted in some way. Restrictions include, for example: (i)
requiring the implementation of organization-approved security controls prior to authorizing
such connections; (ii) limiting access to certain types of information, services, or applications;
(iii) using virtualization techniques to limit processing and storage activities to servers or
other system components provisioned by the organization; and (iv) agreeing to terms and
conditions for usage. For personally owned devices, organizations consult with the Office of
the General Counsel regarding legal issues associated with using such devices in operational
environments, including, for example, requirements for conducting forensic analyses during
investigations after an incident.
(4)

USE OF EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | NETWORK ACCESSIBLE STORAGE DEVICES

The organization prohibits the use of [Assignment: organization-defined network accessible
storage devices] in external information systems.

Facilitates information sharing by enabling authorized users to determine whether access
authorizations assigned to the sharing partner match the access restrictions on the information
for [Assignment: organization-defined information sharing circumstances where user
discretion is required]; and

b.

Employs [Assignment: organization-defined automated mechanisms or manual processes] to

(e.g., privileged medical information, contract-sensitive information, proprietary information,
personally identifiable information, classified information related to special access programs or
compartments) based on some formal or administrative determination. Depending on the particular

a.

Designates individuals authorized to post information onto a publicly accessible information
system;

b.

Trains authorized individuals to ensure that publicly accessible information does not contain
nonpublic information;

c.

Reviews the proposed content of information prior to posting onto the publicly accessible

Supplemental Guidance: In accordance with federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies,

regulations, standards, and/or guidance, the general public is not authorized access to nonpublic
information (e.g., information protected under the Privacy Act and proprietary information). This
control addresses information systems that are controlled by the organization and accessible to the
general public, typically without identification or authentication. The posting of information on

DATA MINING PROTECTION
Control: The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined data mining prevention and

detect and protect against data mining.
Supplemental Guidance: Data storage objects include, for example, databases, database records, and

database fields. Data mining prevention and detection techniques include, for example: (i) limiting
the types of responses provided to database queries; (ii) limiting the number/frequency of database
queries to increase the work factor needed to determine the contents of such databases; and (iii)
notifying organizational personnel when atypical database queries or accesses occur. This control
focuses on the protection of organizational information from data mining while such information
resides in organizational data stores. In contrast, AU-13 focuses on monitoring for organizational
information that may have been mined or otherwise obtained from data stores and is now available
as open source information residing on external sites, for example, through social networking or

ACCESS CONTROL DECISIONS
Control: The organization establishes procedures to ensure [Assignment: organization-defined

access control decisions] are applied to each access request prior to access enforcement.
Supplemental Guidance: Access control decisions (also known as authorization decisions) occur

when authorization information is applied to specific accesses. In contrast, access enforcement
occurs when information systems enforce access control decisions. While it is very common to
have access control decisions and access enforcement implemented by the same entity, it is not
required and it is not always an optimal implementation choice. For some architectures and
distributed information systems, different entities may perform access control decisions and access
enforcement.
Control Enhancements:
(1)

ACCESS CONTROL DECISIONS | TRANSMIT ACCESS AUTHORIZATION INFORMATION

The information system transmits [Assignment: organization-defined access authorization
information] using [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to [Assignment:
organization-defined information systems] that enforce access control decisions.
Supplemental Guidance: In distributed information systems, authorization processes and access
control decisions may occur in separate parts of the systems. In such instances, authorization
information is transmitted securely so timely access control decisions can be enforced at the
appropriate locations. To support the access control decisions, it may be necessary to transmit
as part of the access authorization information, supporting security attributes. This is due to
the fact that in distributed information systems, there are various access control decisions that
need to be made and different entities (e.g., services) make these decisions in a serial fashion,
each requiring some security attributes to make the decisions. Protecting access authorization

information (i.e., access control decisions) ensures that such information cannot be altered,
spoofed, or otherwise compromised during transmission.
(2)

ACCESS CONTROL DECISIONS | NO USER OR PROCESS IDENTITY
The information system enforces access control decisions based on [Assignment: organizationdefined security attributes] that do not include the identity of the user or process acting on behalf
of the user.

Supplemental Guidance: In certain situations, it is important that access control decisions can be

made without information regarding the identity of the users issuing the requests. These are
generally instances where preserving individual privacy is of paramount importance. In other
situations, user identification information is simply not needed for access control decisions
and, especially in the case of distributed information systems, transmitting such information
with the needed degree of assurance may be very expensive or difficult to accomplish.

REFERENCE MONITOR
Control: The information system implements a reference monitor for [Assignment: organizationdefined access control policies] that is tamperproof, always invoked, and small enough to be
subject to analysis and testing, the completeness of which can be assured.

Information is represented internally within information systems using
abstractions known as data structures. Internal data structures can represent different types of
entities, both active and passive. Active entities, also known as subjects, are typically associated
with individuals, devices, or processes acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known
as objects, are typically associated with data structures such as records, buffers, tables, files, interprocess pipes, and communications ports. Reference monitors typically enforce mandatory access
control policies—a type of access control that restricts access to objects based on the identity of
subjects or groups to which the subjects belong. The access controls are mandatory because
subjects with certain privileges (i.e., access permissions) are restricted from passing those
privileges on to any other subjects, either directly or indirectly—that is, the information system
strictly enforces the access control policy based on the rule set established by the policy. The
tamperproof property of the reference monitor prevents adversaries from compromising the
functioning of the mechanism. The always invoked property prevents adversaries from bypassing
the mechanism and hence violating the security policy. The smallness property helps to ensure the
completeness in the analysis and testing of the mechanism to detect weaknesses or deficiencies
(i.e., latent flaws) that would prevent the enforcement of the security policy. Related controls: AC3, AC-16, SC-3, SC-39.

Supplemental Guidance: Practical exercises may include, for example, security training for

software developers that includes simulated cyber attacks exploiting common software
vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows), or spear/whale phishing attacks targeted at senior
leaders/executives. These types of practical exercises help developers better understand the
effects of such vulnerabilities and appreciate the need for security coding standards and
processes.
(4)

ROLE-BASED SECURITY TRAINING | SUSPICIOUS COMMUNICATIONS AND ANOMALOUS SYSTEM BEHAVIOR

The organization provides training to its personnel on [Assignment: organization-defined
indicators of malicious code] to recognize suspicious communications and anomalous behavior in
organizational information systems.
Supplemental Guidance: A well-trained workforce provides another organizational safeguard

that can be employed as part of a defense-in-depth strategy to protect organizations against
malicious code coming in to organizations via email or the web applications. Personnel are
trained to look for indications of potentially suspicious email (e.g., receiving an unexpected
email, receiving an email containing strange or poor grammar, or receiving an email from an
unfamiliar sender but who appears to be from a known sponsor or contractor). Personnel are
also trained on how to respond to such suspicious email or web communications (e.g., not
opening attachments, not clicking on embedded web links, and checking the source of email
addresses). For this process to work effectively, all organizational personnel are trained and
made aware of what constitutes suspicious communications. Training personnel on how to
recognize anomalous behaviors in organizational information systems can potentially provide
early warning for the presence of malicious code. Recognition of such anomalous behavior by
organizational personnel can supplement automated malicious code detection and protection
tools and systems employed by organizations.

Determines that the following events are to be audited within the information system:
[Assignment: organization-defined audited events (the subset of the auditable events defined
in AU-2 a.) along with the frequency of (or situation requiring) auditing for each identified

Supplemental Guidance: An event is any observable occurrence in an organizational information

system. Organizations identify audit events as those events which are significant and relevant to

APPENDIX F-AU

PAGE F-41

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

the security of information systems and the environments in which those systems operate in order
to meet specific and ongoing audit needs. Audit events can include, for example, password
changes, failed logons, or failed accesses related to information systems, administrative privilege
usage, PIV credential usage, or third-party credential usage. In determining the set of auditable
events, organizations consider the auditing appropriate for each of the security controls to be
implemented. To balance auditing requirements with other information system needs, this control
also requires identifying that subset of auditable events that are audited at a given point in time.
For example, organizations may determine that information systems must have the capability to
log every file access both successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for
specific circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance. Auditing requirements,
including the need for auditable events, may be referenced in other security controls and control
enhancements. Organizations also include auditable events that are required by applicable federal
laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards. Audit records can be
generated at various levels of abstraction, including at the packet level as information traverses the
network. Selecting the appropriate level of abstraction is a critical aspect of an audit capability and
can facilitate the identification of root causes to problems. Organizations consider in the definition
of auditable events, the auditing necessary to cover related events such as the steps in distributed,
transaction-based processes (e.g., processes that are distributed across multiple organizations) and
actions that occur in service-oriented architectures. Related controls: AC-6, AC-17, AU-3, AU-12,

Supplemental Guidance: Off-loading is a process designed to preserve the confidentiality and

integrity of audit records by moving the records from the primary information system to a
secondary or alternate system. It is a common process in information systems with limited
audit storage capacity; the audit storage is used only in a transitory fashion until the system
can communicate with the secondary or alternate system designated for storing the audit
records, at which point the information is transferred.

failures in the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded.
Organizations may choose to define additional actions for different audit processing failures (e.g.,
by type, by location, by severity, or a combination of such factors). This control applies to each
audit data storage repository (i.e., distinct information system component where audit records are
stored), the total audit storage capacity of organizations (i.e., all audit data storage repositories
combined), or both. Related controls: AU-4, SI-12.

record storage volume reaches [Assignment: organization-defined percentage] of repository
maximum audit record storage capacity.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations may have multiple audit data storage repositories

distributed across multiple information system components, with each repository having
different storage volume capacities.
(2)

failure events occur: [Assignment: organization-defined audit failure events requiring real-time
alerts].
Supplemental Guidance: Alerts provide organizations with urgent messages. Real-time alerts

provide these messages at information technology speed (i.e., the time from event detection to
alert occurs in seconds or less).
(3)

RESPONSE TO AUDIT PROCESSING FAILURES | CONFIGURABLE TRAFFIC VOLUME THRESHOLDS

The information system enforces configurable network communications traffic volume thresholds
reflecting limits on auditing capacity and [Selection: rejects; delays] network traffic above those
thresholds.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations have the capability to reject or delay the processing of

network communications traffic if auditing such traffic is determined to exceed the storage
capacity of the information system audit function. The rejection or delay response is triggered
by the established organizational traffic volume thresholds which can be adjusted based on
changes to audit storage capacity.

RESPONSE TO AUDIT PROCESSING FAILURES | SHUTDOWN ON FAILURE

The information system invokes a [Selection: full system shutdown; partial system shutdown;
degraded operational mode with limited mission/business functionality available] in the event of
[Assignment: organization-defined audit failures], unless an alternate audit capability exists.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations determine the types of audit failures that can trigger

automatic information system shutdowns or degraded operations. Because of the importance
of ensuring mission/business continuity, organizations may determine that the nature of the
audit failure is not so severe that it warrants a complete shutdown of the information system
supporting the core organizational missions/business operations. In those instances, partial
information system shutdowns or operating in a degraded mode with reduced capability may
be viable alternatives. Related control: AU-15.

The information system provides the capability to centrally review and analyze audit records from
multiple components within the system.
Supplemental Guidance: Automated mechanisms for centralized reviews and analyses include,

for example, Security Information Management products. Related controls: AU-2, AU-12.
(5)

AUDIT REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING | INTEGRATION / SCANNING AND MONITORING CAPABILITIES

The organization integrates analysis of audit records with analysis of [Selection (one or more):
vulnerability scanning information; performance data; information system monitoring information;
[Assignment: organization-defined data/information collected from other sources]] to further
enhance the ability to identify inappropriate or unusual activity.

APPENDIX F-AU

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement does not require vulnerability scanning, the

generation of performance data, or information system monitoring. Rather, the enhancement
requires that the analysis of information being otherwise produced in these areas is integrated
with the analysis of audit information. Security Event and Information Management System
tools can facilitate audit record aggregation/consolidation from multiple information system
components as well as audit record correlation and analysis. The use of standardized audit
record analysis scripts developed by organizations (with localized script adjustments, as
necessary) provides more cost-effective approaches for analyzing audit record information
collected. The correlation of audit record information with vulnerability scanning information
is important in determining the veracity of vulnerability scans and correlating attack detection
events with scanning results. Correlation with performance data can help uncover denial of
service attacks or cyber attacks resulting in unauthorized use of resources. Correlation with
system monitoring information can assist in uncovering attacks and in better relating audit
information to operational situations. Related controls: AU-12, IR-4, RA-5.
(6)

AUDIT REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING | CORRELATION WITH PHYSICAL MONITORING

The organization correlates information from audit records with information obtained from
monitoring physical access to further enhance the ability to identify suspicious, inappropriate,
unusual, or malevolent activity.
Supplemental Guidance: The correlation of physical audit information and audit logs from

information systems may assist organizations in identifying examples of suspicious behavior
or supporting evidence of such behavior. For example, the correlation of an individual’s
identity for logical access to certain information systems with the additional physical security
information that the individual was actually present at the facility when the logical access
occurred, may prove to be useful in investigations.
(7)

AUDIT REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING | PERMITTED ACTIONS

The organization specifies the permitted actions for each [Selection (one or more): information
system process; role; user] associated with the review, analysis, and reporting of audit
information.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations specify permitted actions for information system

processes, roles, and/or users associated with the review, analysis, and reporting of audit
records through account management techniques. Specifying permitted actions on audit
information is a way to enforce the principle of least privilege. Permitted actions are enforced
by the information system and include, for example, read, write, execute, append, and delete.
(8)

AUDIT REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING | FULL TEXT ANALYSIS OF PRIVILEGED COMMANDS

The organization performs a full text analysis of audited privileged commands in a physically
distinct component or subsystem of the information system, or other information system that is
dedicated to that analysis.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement requires a distinct environment for the

dedicated analysis of audit information related to privileged users without compromising such
information on the information system where the users have elevated privileges including the
capability to execute privileged commands. Full text analysis refers to analysis that considers
the full text of privileged commands (i.e., commands and all parameters) as opposed to
analysis that considers only the name of the command. Full text analysis includes, for
example, the use of pattern matching and heuristics. Related controls: AU-3, AU-9, AU-11,
AU-12.
(9)

AUDIT REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING | CORRELATION WITH INFORMATION FROM NONTECHNICAL SOURCES

The organization correlates information from nontechnical sources with audit information to
enhance organization-wide situational awareness.
Supplemental Guidance: Nontechnical sources include, for example, human resources records

documenting organizational policy violations (e.g., sexual harassment incidents, improper use
of organizational information assets). Such information can lead organizations to a more
directed analytical effort to detect potential malicious insider activity. Due to the sensitive
nature of the information available from nontechnical sources, organizations limit access to
such information to minimize the potential for the inadvertent release of privacy-related
information to individuals that do not have a need to know. Thus, correlation of information

APPENDIX F-AU

________________________________________________________________________________________________

from nontechnical sources with audit information generally occurs only when individuals are
suspected of being involved in a security incident. Organizations obtain legal advice prior to
initiating such actions. Related control: AT-2.
(10) AUDIT REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING | AUDIT LEVEL ADJUSTMENT
The organization adjusts the level of audit review, analysis, and reporting within the information
system when there is a change in risk based on law enforcement information, intelligence
information, or other credible sources of information.
Supplemental Guidance: The frequency, scope, and/or depth of the audit review, analysis, and

reporting may be adjusted to meet organizational needs based on new information received.

AUDIT REDUCTION AND REPORT GENERATION
Control: The information system provides an audit reduction and report generation capability that:

a.

Supports on-demand audit review, analysis, and reporting requirements and after-the-fact
investigations of security incidents; and

b.

Does not alter the original content or time ordering of audit records.

Supplemental Guidance: Audit reduction is a process that manipulates collected audit information

and organizes such information in a summary format that is more meaningful to analysts. Audit
reduction and report generation capabilities do not always emanate from the same information
system or from the same organizational entities conducting auditing activities. Audit reduction
capability can include, for example, modern data mining techniques with advanced data filters to
identify anomalous behavior in audit records. The report generation capability provided by the
information system can generate customizable reports. Time ordering of audit records can be a
significant issue if the granularity of the timestamp in the record is insufficient. Related control:
AU-6.
Control Enhancements:
(1)

AUDIT REDUCTION AND REPORT GENERATION | AUTOMATIC PROCESSING

The information system provides the capability to process audit records for events of interest
based on [Assignment: organization-defined audit fields within audit records].
Supplemental Guidance: Events of interest can be identified by the content of specific audit

record fields including, for example, identities of individuals, event types, event locations,
event times, event dates, system resources involved, IP addresses involved, or information
objects accessed. Organizations may define audit event criteria to any degree of granularity
required, for example, locations selectable by general networking location (e.g., by network or
subnetwork) or selectable by specific information system component. Related controls: AU-2,
AU-12.
(2)

AUDIT REDUCTION AND REPORT GENERATION | AUTOMATIC SORT AND SEARCH
The information system provides the capability to sort and search audit records for events of
interest based on the content of [Assignment: organization-defined audit fields within audit
records].

Supplemental Guidance: Sorting and searching of audit records may be based upon the contents

of audit record fields, for example: (i) date/time of events; (ii) user identifiers; (iii) Internet
Protocol (IP) addresses involved in the event; (iv) type of event; or (v) event success/failure.

TIME STAMPS
Control: The information system:

a.

Uses internal system clocks to generate time stamps for audit records; and

b.

Records time stamps for audit records that can be mapped to Coordinated Universal Time
(UTC) or Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and meets [Assignment: organization-defined
granularity of time measurement].

Supplemental Guidance: Time stamps generated by the information system include date and time.

Time is commonly expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation of
Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC. Granularity of time
measurements refers to the degree of synchronization between information system clocks and
reference clocks, for example, clocks synchronizing within hundreds of milliseconds or within
tens of milliseconds. Organizations may define different time granularities for different system
components. Time service can also be critical to other security capabilities such as access control
and identification and authentication, depending on the nature of the mechanisms used to support
those capabilities. Related controls: AU-3, AU-12.
Control Enhancements:

TIME STAMPS | SYNCHRONIZATION WITH AUTHORITATIVE TIME SOURCE

The information system:
(a)

Compares the internal information system clocks [Assignment: organization-defined
frequency] with [Assignment: organization-defined authoritative time source]; and

(b) Synchronizes the internal system clocks to the authoritative time source when the time
difference is greater than [Assignment: organization-defined time period].
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement provides uniformity of time stamps for

information systems with multiple system clocks and systems connected over a network.

access, modification, and deletion.
Supplemental Guidance: Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit

settings, and audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system activity. This control
focuses on technical protection of audit information. Physical protection of audit information is
addressed by media protection controls and physical and environmental protection controls.

PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION | HARDWARE WRITE-ONCE MEDIA
The information system writes audit trails to hardware-enforced, write-once media.

Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement applies to the initial generation of audit

trails (i.e., the collection of audit records that represents the audit information to be used for
detection, analysis, and reporting purposes) and to the backup of those audit trails. The
enhancement does not apply to the initial generation of audit records prior to being written to
an audit trail. Write-once, read-many (WORM) media includes, for example, Compact DiskRecordable (CD-R) and Digital Video Disk-Recordable (DVD-R). In contrast, the use of
switchable write-protection media such as on tape cartridges or Universal Serial Bus (USB)
drives results in write-protected, but not write-once, media. Related controls: AU-4, AU-5.
(2)

PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION | AUDIT BACKUP ON SEPARATE PHYSICAL SYSTEMS / COMPONENTS
The information system backs up audit records [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] onto
a physically different system or system component than the system or component being audited.

Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement helps to ensure that a compromise of the

information system being audited does not also result in a compromise of the audit records.
Related controls: AU-4, AU-5, AU-11.
(3)

PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION | CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION

The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to protect the integrity of audit
information and audit tools.
Supplemental Guidance: Cryptographic mechanisms used for protecting the integrity of audit

information include, for example, signed hash functions using asymmetric cryptography
enabling distribution of the public key to verify the hash information while maintaining the
confidentiality of the secret key used to generate the hash. Related controls: AU-10, SC-12,
SC-13.
(4)

PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION | ACCESS BY SUBSET OF PRIVILEGED USERS

The organization authorizes access to management of audit functionality to only [Assignment:
organization-defined subset of privileged users].
Supplemental Guidance: Individuals with privileged access to an information system and who

are also the subject of an audit by that system, may affect the reliability of audit information
by inhibiting audit activities or modifying audit records. This control enhancement requires
that privileged access be further defined between audit-related privileges and other privileges,
thus limiting the users with audit-related privileges. Related control: AC-5.
(5)

PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION | DUAL AUTHORIZATION

The organization enforces dual authorization for [Selection (one or more): movement; deletion] of
[Assignment: organization-defined audit information].
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations may choose different selection options for different

types of audit information. Dual authorization mechanisms require the approval of two
authorized individuals in order to execute. Dual authorization may also be known as twoperson control. Related controls: AC-3, MP-2.
(6)

PROTECTION OF AUDIT INFORMATION | READ ONLY ACCESS

The organization authorizes read-only access to audit information to [Assignment: organizationdefined subset of privileged users].
Supplemental Guidance: Restricting privileged user authorizations to read-only helps to limit

the potential damage to organizations that could be initiated by such users (e.g., deleting audit
records to cover up malicious activity).

NON-REPUDIATION
Control: The information system protects against an individual (or process acting on behalf of an

individual) falsely denying having performed [Assignment: organization-defined actions to be
covered by non-repudiation].
Supplemental Guidance: Types of individual actions covered by non-repudiation include, for

example, creating information, sending and receiving messages, approving information (e.g.,
indicating concurrence or signing a contract). Non-repudiation protects individuals against later
claims by: (i) authors of not having authored particular documents; (ii) senders of not having
transmitted messages; (iii) receivers of not having received messages; or (iv) signatories of not
having signed documents. Non-repudiation services can be used to determine if information
originated from a particular individual, or if an individual took specific actions (e.g., sending an
email, signing a contract, approving a procurement request) or received specific information.
Organizations obtain non-repudiation services by employing various techniques or mechanisms
(e.g., digital signatures, digital message receipts). Related controls: SC-12, SC-8, SC-13, SC-16,
SC-17, SC-23.
Control Enhancements:
(1)

NON-REPUDIATION | ASSOCIATION OF IDENTITIES

The information system:
(a)

Binds the identity of the information producer with the information to [Assignment:
organization-defined strength of binding]; and

(b) Provides the means for authorized individuals to determine the identity of the producer of the
information.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement supports audit requirements that provide

organizational personnel with the means to identify who produced specific information in the
event of an information transfer. Organizations determine and approve the strength of the
binding between the information producer and the information based on the security category
of the information and relevant risk factors. Related controls: AC-4, AC-16.
(2)

NON-REPUDIATION | VALIDATE BINDING OF INFORMATION PRODUCER IDENTITY

The information system:
(a)

Validates the binding of the information producer identity to the information at [Assignment:
organization-defined frequency]; and

(b) Performs [Assignment: organization-defined actions] in the event of a validation error.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement prevents the modification of information

between production and review. The validation of bindings can be achieved, for example, by
the use of cryptographic checksums. Organizations determine if validations are in response to
user requests or generated automatically. Related controls: AC-3, AC-4, AC-16.
(3)

NON-REPUDIATION | CHAIN OF CUSTODY
The information system maintains reviewer/releaser identity and credentials within the established
chain of custody for all information reviewed or released.

Supplemental Guidance: Chain of custody is a process that tracks the movement of evidence

through its collection, safeguarding, and analysis life cycle by documenting each person who
handled the evidence, the date and time it was collected or transferred, and the purpose for the
transfer. If the reviewer is a human or if the review function is automated but separate from
the release/transfer function, the information system associates the identity of the reviewer of
the information to be released with the information and the information label. In the case of
human reviews, this control enhancement provides organizational officials the means to
identify who reviewed and released the information. In the case of automated reviews, this
control enhancement ensures that only approved review functions are employed. Related

security incidents and to meet regulatory and organizational information retention requirements.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations retain audit records until it is determined that they are no

longer needed for administrative, legal, audit, or other operational purposes. This includes, for
example, retention and availability of audit records relative to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
requests, subpoenas, and law enforcement actions. Organizations develop standard categories of
audit records relative to such types of actions and standard response processes for each type of
action. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) General Records Schedules

components. The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated.
These events are typically a subset of all events for which the information system is capable of
generating audit records. Related controls: AC-3, AU-2, AU-3, AU-6, AU-7.
Control Enhancements:

AUDIT GENERATION | SYSTEM-WIDE / TIME-CORRELATED AUDIT TRAIL

The information system compiles audit records from [Assignment: organization-defined
information system components] into a system-wide (logical or physical) audit trail that is timecorrelated to within [Assignment: organization-defined level of tolerance for the relationship
between time stamps of individual records in the audit trail].
Supplemental Guidance: Audit trails are time-correlated if the time stamps in the individual

audit records can be reliably related to the time stamps in other audit records to achieve a time
ordering of the records within organizational tolerances. Related controls: AU-8, AU-12.
(2)

AUDIT GENERATION | STANDARDIZED FORMATS

The information system produces a system-wide (logical or physical) audit trail composed of audit
records in a standardized format.
Supplemental Guidance: Audit information that is normalized to common standards promotes

interoperability and exchange of such information between dissimilar devices and information
systems. This facilitates production of event information that can be more readily analyzed
and correlated. Standard formats for audit records include, for example, system log records
and audit records compliant with Common Event Expressions (CEE). If logging mechanisms
within information systems do not conform to standardized formats, systems may convert
individual audit records into standardized formats when compiling system-wide audit trails.

system components] based on [Assignment: organization-defined selectable event criteria] within
[Assignment: organization-defined time thresholds].
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement enables organizations to extend or limit

auditing as necessary to meet organizational requirements. Auditing that is limited to conserve
information system resources may be extended to address certain threat situations. In addition,
auditing may be limited to a specific set of events to facilitate audit reduction, analysis, and
reporting. Organizations can establish time thresholds in which audit actions are changed, for
example, near real-time, within minutes, or within hours. Related control: AU-7.

CROSS-ORGANIZATIONAL AUDITING
Control: The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined methods] for coordinating
[Assignment: organization-defined audit information] among external organizations when audit
information is transmitted across organizational boundaries.
Supplemental Guidance: When organizations use information systems and/or services of external

organizations, the auditing capability necessitates a coordinated approach across organizations.
For example, maintaining the identity of individuals that requested particular services across
organizational boundaries may often be very difficult, and doing so may prove to have significant
performance ramifications. Therefore, it is often the case that cross-organizational auditing (e.g.,
the type of auditing capability provided by service-oriented architectures) simply captures the
identity of individuals issuing requests at the initial information system, and subsequent systems
record that the requests emanated from authorized individuals. Related control: AU-6.
Control Enhancements:

(2)

CROSS-ORGANIZATIONAL AUDITING | SHARING OF AUDIT INFORMATION

The organization provides cross-organizational audit information to [Assignment: organizationdefined organizations] based on [Assignment: organization-defined cross-organizational sharing
agreements].
Supplemental Guidance: Because of the distributed nature of the audit information, cross-

organization sharing of audit information may be essential for effective analysis of the
auditing being performed. For example, the audit records of one organization may not provide
sufficient information to determine the appropriate or inappropriate use of organizational
information resources by individuals in other organizations. In some instances, only the home
organizations of individuals have the appropriate knowledge to make such determinations,
thus requiring the sharing of audit information among organizations.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

d.

Provides the results of the security control assessment to [Assignment: organization-defined
individuals or roles].

Supplemental Guidance: Organizations assess security controls in organizational information

systems and the environments in which those systems operate as part of: (i) initial and ongoing
security authorizations; (ii) FISMA annual assessments; (iii) continuous monitoring; and (iv)
system development life cycle activities. Security assessments: (i) ensure that information security
is built into organizational information systems; (ii) identify weaknesses and deficiencies early in
the development process; (iii) provide essential information needed to make risk-based decisions
as part of security authorization processes; and (iv) ensure compliance to vulnerability mitigation
procedures. Assessments are conducted on the implemented security controls from Appendix F
(main catalog) and Appendix G (Program Management controls) as documented in System
Security Plans and Information Security Program Plans. Organizations can use other types of
assessment activities such as vulnerability scanning and system monitoring to maintain the
security posture of information systems during the entire life cycle. Security assessment reports
document assessment results in sufficient detail as deemed necessary by organizations, to
determine the accuracy and completeness of the reports and whether the security controls are
implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to
meeting security requirements. The FISMA requirement for assessing security controls at least
annually does not require additional assessment activities to those activities already in place in
organizational security authorization processes. Security assessment results are provided to the
individuals or roles appropriate for the types of assessments being conducted. For example,
assessments conducted in support of security authorization decisions are provided to authorizing
officials or authorizing official designated representatives.
To satisfy annual assessment requirements, organizations can use assessment results from the
following sources: (i) initial or ongoing information system authorizations; (ii) continuous
monitoring; or (iii) system development life cycle activities. Organizations ensure that security
assessment results are current, relevant to the determination of security control effectiveness, and
obtained with the appropriate level of assessor independence. Existing security control assessment
results can be reused to the extent that the results are still valid and can also be supplemented with
additional assessments as needed. Subsequent to initial authorizations and in accordance with
OMB policy, organizations assess security controls during continuous monitoring. Organizations
establish the frequency for ongoing security control assessments in accordance with organizational
continuous monitoring strategies. Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts provide useful
examples of vulnerability mitigation procedures. External audits (e.g., audits by external entities
such as regulatory agencies) are outside the scope of this control. Related controls: CA-5, CA-6,

SECURITY ASSESSMENTS | INDEPENDENT ASSESSORS

The organization employs assessors or assessment teams with [Assignment: organization-defined
level of independence] to conduct security control assessments.
Supplemental Guidance: Independent assessors or assessment teams are individuals or groups

who conduct impartial assessments of organizational information systems. Impartiality
implies that assessors are free from any perceived or actual conflicts of interest with regard to
the development, operation, or management of the organizational information systems under
assessment or to the determination of security control effectiveness. To achieve impartiality,
assessors should not: (i) create a mutual or conflicting interest with the organizations where
the assessments are being conducted; (ii) assess their own work; (iii) act as management or
employees of the organizations they are serving; or (iv) place themselves in positions of
advocacy for the organizations acquiring their services. Independent assessments can be
obtained from elements within organizations or can be contracted to public or private sector
entities outside of organizations. Authorizing officials determine the required level of
independence based on the security categories of information systems and/or the ultimate risk
to organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals. Authorizing officials also
determine if the level of assessor independence provides sufficient assurance that the results

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

are sound and can be used to make credible, risk-based decisions. This includes determining
whether contracted security assessment services have sufficient independence, for example,
when information system owners are not directly involved in contracting processes or cannot
unduly influence the impartiality of assessors conducting assessments. In special situations,
for example, when organizations that own the information systems are small or organizational
structures require that assessments are conducted by individuals that are in the developmental,
operational, or management chain of system owners, independence in assessment processes
can be achieved by ensuring that assessment results are carefully reviewed and analyzed by
independent teams of experts to validate the completeness, accuracy, integrity, and reliability
of the results. Organizations recognize that assessments performed for purposes other than
direct support to authorization decisions are, when performed by assessors with sufficient
independence, more likely to be useable for such decisions, thereby reducing the need to
repeat assessments.

SECURITY ASSESSMENTS | SPECIALIZED ASSESSMENTS
The organization includes as part of security control assessments, [Assignment: organizationdefined frequency], [Selection: announced; unannounced], [Selection (one or more): in-depth
monitoring; vulnerability scanning; malicious user testing; insider threat assessment;
performance/load testing; [Assignment: organization-defined other forms of security assessment]].

Supplemental Guidance: Organizations can employ information system monitoring, insider

threat assessments, malicious user testing, and other forms of testing (e.g., verification and
validation) to improve readiness by exercising organizational capabilities and indicating
current performance levels as a means of focusing actions to improve security. Organizations
conduct assessment activities in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders,
directives, policies, regulations, and standards. Authorizing officials approve the assessment
methods in coordination with the organizational risk executive function. Organizations can
incorporate vulnerabilities uncovered during assessments into vulnerability remediation
processes. Related controls: PE-3, SI-2.

SECURITY ASSESSMENTS | EXTERNAL ORGANIZATIONS

The organization accepts the results of an assessment of [Assignment: organization-defined
information system] performed by [Assignment: organization-defined external organization] when
the assessment meets [Assignment: organization-defined requirements].
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations may often rely on assessments of specific information

systems by other (external) organizations. Utilizing such existing assessments (i.e., reusing
existing assessment evidence) can significantly decrease the time and resources required for
organizational assessments by limiting the amount of independent assessment activities that
organizations need to perform. The factors that organizations may consider in determining
whether to accept assessment results from external organizations can vary. Determinations for
accepting assessment results can be based on, for example, past assessment experiences one
organization has had with another organization, the reputation that organizations have with
regard to assessments, the level of detail of supporting assessment documentation provided, or
mandates imposed upon organizations by federal legislation, policies, or directives.

Supplemental Guidance: This control applies to dedicated connections between information systems

(i.e., system interconnections) and does not apply to transitory, user-controlled connections such
as email and website browsing. Organizations carefully consider the risks that may be introduced
when information systems are connected to other systems with different security requirements and
security controls, both within organizations and external to organizations. Authorizing officials
determine the risk associated with information system connections and the appropriate controls
employed. If interconnecting systems have the same authorizing official, organizations do not
need to develop Interconnection Security Agreements. Instead, organizations can describe the
interface characteristics between those interconnecting systems in their respective security plans.
If interconnecting systems have different authorizing officials within the same organization,
organizations can either develop Interconnection Security Agreements or describe the interface
characteristics between systems in the security plans for the respective systems. Organizations
may also incorporate Interconnection Security Agreement information into formal contracts,
especially for interconnections established between federal agencies and nonfederal (i.e., private
sector) organizations. Risk considerations also include information systems sharing the same
networks. For certain technologies (e.g., space, unmanned aerial vehicles, and medical devices),
there may be specialized connections in place during preoperational testing. Such connections may
require Interconnection Security Agreements and be subject to additional security controls.

SECURITY AUTHORIZATION
Control: The organization:

a.

Assigns a senior-level executive or manager as the authorizing official for the information
system;

b.

Ensures that the authorizing official authorizes the information system for processing before
commencing operations; and

c.

Updates the security authorization [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].

Supplemental Guidance: Security authorizations are official management decisions, conveyed

through authorization decision documents, by senior organizational officials or executives (i.e.,
authorizing officials) to authorize operation of information systems and to explicitly accept the
risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation based
on the implementation of agreed-upon security controls. Authorizing officials provide budgetary
oversight for organizational information systems or assume responsibility for the mission/business
operations supported by those systems. The security authorization process is an inherently federal
responsibility and therefore, authorizing officials must be federal employees. Through the security
authorization process, authorizing officials assume responsibility and are accountable for security
risks associated with the operation and use of organizational information systems. Accordingly,
authorizing officials are in positions with levels of authority commensurate with understanding
and accepting such information security-related risks. OMB policy requires that organizations
conduct ongoing authorizations of information systems by implementing continuous monitoring
programs. Continuous monitoring programs can satisfy three-year reauthorization requirements, so
separate reauthorization processes are not necessary. Through the employment of comprehensive
continuous monitoring processes, critical information contained in authorization packages (i.e.,
security plans, security assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones) is updated on an
ongoing basis, providing authorizing officials and information system owners with an up-to-date
status of the security state of organizational information systems and environments of operation.
To reduce the administrative cost of security reauthorization, authorizing officials use the results
of continuous monitoring processes to the maximum extent possible as the basis for rendering
reauthorization decisions. Related controls: CA-2, CA-7, PM-9, PM-10.

g.

Reporting the security status of organization and the information system to [Assignment:
organization-defined personnel or roles] [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].

Supplemental Guidance: Continuous monitoring programs facilitate ongoing awareness of threats,

vulnerabilities, and information security to support organizational risk management decisions. The
terms continuous and ongoing imply that organizations assess/analyze security controls and
information security-related risks at a frequency sufficient to support organizational risk-based
decisions. The results of continuous monitoring programs generate appropriate risk response
actions by organizations. Continuous monitoring programs also allow organizations to maintain
the security authorizations of information systems and common controls over time in highly
dynamic environments of operation with changing mission/business needs, threats, vulnerabilities,
and technologies. Having access to security-related information on a continuing basis through
reports/dashboards gives organizational officials the capability to make more effective and timely
risk management decisions, including ongoing security authorization decisions. Automation
supports more frequent updates to security authorization packages, hardware/software/firmware
inventories, and other system information. Effectiveness is further enhanced when continuous
monitoring outputs are formatted to provide information that is specific, measurable, actionable,
relevant, and timely. Continuous monitoring activities are scaled in accordance with the security
categories of information systems. Related controls: CA-2, CA-5, CA-6, CM-3, CM-4, PM-6, PM9, RA-5, SA-11, SA-12, SI-2, SI-4.

CONTINUOUS MONITORING | INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT
The organization employs assessors or assessment teams with [Assignment: organization-defined

Supplemental Guidance: Organizations can maximize the value of assessments of security

controls during the continuous monitoring process by requiring that such assessments be
conducted by assessors or assessment teams with appropriate levels of independence based on
continuous monitoring strategies. Assessor independence provides a degree of impartiality to
the monitoring process. To achieve such impartiality, assessors should not: (i) create a mutual
or conflicting interest with the organizations where the assessments are being conducted; (ii)
assess their own work; (iii) act as management or employees of the organizations they are
serving; or (iv) place themselves in advocacy positions for the organizations acquiring their

Supplemental Guidance: Trend analyses can include, for example, examining recent threat

information regarding the types of threat events that have occurred within the organization or
across the federal government, success rates of certain types of cyber attacks, emerging
vulnerabilities in information technologies, evolving social engineering techniques, results
from multiple security control assessments, the effectiveness of configuration settings, and
findings from Inspectors General or auditors.

PENETRATION TESTING
Control: The organization conducts penetration testing [Assignment: organization-defined
frequency] on [Assignment: organization-defined information systems or system components].
Supplemental Guidance: Penetration testing is a specialized type of assessment conducted on

information systems or individual system components to identify vulnerabilities that could be
exploited by adversaries. Such testing can be used to either validate vulnerabilities or determine
the degree of resistance organizational information systems have to adversaries within a set of
specified constraints (e.g., time, resources, and/or skills). Penetration testing attempts to duplicate
the actions of adversaries in carrying out hostile cyber attacks against organizations and provides a
more in-depth analysis of security-related weaknesses/deficiencies. Organizations can also use the
results of vulnerability analyses to support penetration testing activities. Penetration testing can be
conducted on the hardware, software, or firmware components of an information system and can
exercise both physical and technical security controls. A standard method for penetration testing
includes, for example: (i) pretest analysis based on full knowledge of the target system; (ii) pretest
identification of potential vulnerabilities based on pretest analysis; and (iii) testing designed to
determine exploitability of identified vulnerabilities. All parties agree to the rules of engagement
before the commencement of penetration testing scenarios. Organizations correlate the penetration
testing rules of engagement with the tools, techniques, and procedures that are anticipated to be
employed by adversaries carrying out attacks. Organizational risk assessments guide decisions on
the level of independence required for personnel conducting penetration testing. Related control:

PENETRATION TESTING | INDEPENDENT PENETRATION AGENT OR TEAM

The organization employs an independent penetration agent or penetration team to perform
penetration testing on the information system or system components.
Supplemental Guidance: Independent penetration agents or teams are individuals or groups who

conduct impartial penetration testing of organizational information systems. Impartiality
implies that penetration agents or teams are free from any perceived or actual conflicts of
interest with regard to the development, operation, or management of the information systems
that are the targets of the penetration testing. Supplemental guidance for CA-2 (1) provides
additional information regarding independent assessments that can be applied to penetration

PENETRATION TESTING | RED TEAM EXERCISES

The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined red team exercises] to simulate
attempts by adversaries to compromise organizational information systems in accordance with
[Assignment: organization-defined rules of engagement].
Supplemental Guidance: Red team exercises extend the objectives of penetration testing by

examining the security posture of organizations and their ability to implement effective cyber
defenses. As such, red team exercises reflect simulated adversarial attempts to compromise
organizational mission/business functions and provide a comprehensive assessment of the
security state of information systems and organizations. Simulated adversarial attempts to
compromise organizational missions/business functions and the information systems that
support those missions/functions may include technology-focused attacks (e.g., interactions
with hardware, software, or firmware components and/or mission/business processes) and
social engineering-based attacks (e.g., interactions via email, telephone, shoulder surfing, or
personal conversations). While penetration testing may be largely laboratory-based testing,
organizations use red team exercises to provide more comprehensive assessments that reflect

Baseline configurations are documented, formally reviewed and agreed-upon sets of specifications
for information systems or configuration items within those systems. Baseline configurations
serve as a basis for future builds, releases, and/or changes to information systems. Baseline
configurations include information about information system components (e.g., standard software
packages installed on workstations, notebook computers, servers, network components, or mobile
devices; current version numbers and patch information on operating systems and applications;
and configuration settings/parameters), network topology, and the logical placement of those

inventory tools, configuration management tools, and network management tools. Such tools
can be deployed and/or allocated as common controls, at the information system level, or at
the operating system or component level (e.g., on workstations, servers, notebook computers,

Supplemental Guidance: Establishing separate baseline configurations for development, testing,

and operational environments helps protect information systems from unplanned/unexpected
events related to development and testing activities. Separate baseline configurations allow
organizations to apply the configuration management that is most appropriate for each type of
configuration. For example, management of operational configurations typically emphasizes
the need for stability, while management of development/test configurations requires greater
flexibility. Configurations in the test environment mirror the configurations in the operational
environment to the extent practicable so that the results of the testing are representative of the
proposed changes to the operational systems. This control enhancement requires separate
configurations but not necessarily separate physical environments. Related controls: CM-4,

Supplemental Guidance: When it is known that information systems, system components, or

devices (e.g., notebook computers, mobile devices) will be located in high-risk areas,
additional security controls may be implemented to counter the greater threat in such areas
coupled with the lack of physical security relative to organizational-controlled areas. For
example, organizational policies and procedures for notebook computers used by individuals
departing on and returning from travel include, for example, determining which locations are
of concern, defining required configurations for the devices, ensuring that the devices are
configured as intended before travel is initiated, and applying specific safeguards to the
device after travel is completed. Specially configured notebook computers include, for
example, computers with sanitized hard drives, limited applications, and additional hardening
(e.g., more stringent configuration settings). Specified safeguards applied to mobile devices
upon return from travel include, for example, examining the device for signs of physical
tampering and purging/reimaging the hard disk drive. Protecting information residing on
mobile devices is covered in the media protection family.

(b) Notify [Assignment: organized-defined approval authorities] of proposed changes to the
information system and request change approval;
(c)

Highlight proposed changes to the information system that have not been approved or
disapproved by [Assignment: organization-defined time period];

(d) Prohibit changes to the information system until designated approvals are received;

(2)

(e)

Document all changes to the information system; and

(f)

Notify [Assignment: organization-defined personnel] when approved changes to the
information system are completed.

CONFIGURATION CHANGE CONTROL | TEST / VALIDATE / DOCUMENT CHANGES

The organization tests, validates, and documents changes to the information system before
implementing the changes on the operational system.
Supplemental Guidance: Changes to information systems include modifications to hardware,

software, or firmware components and configuration settings defined in CM-6. Organizations
ensure that testing does not interfere with information system operations. Individuals/groups
conducting tests understand organizational security policies and procedures, information
system security policies and procedures, and the specific health, safety, and environmental
risks associated with particular facilities/processes. Operational systems may need to be taken
off-line, or replicated to the extent feasible, before testing can be conducted. If information
systems must be taken off-line for testing, the tests are scheduled to occur during planned
system outages whenever possible. If testing cannot be conducted on operational systems,
organizations employ compensating controls (e.g., testing on replicated systems).
(3)

CONFIGURATION CHANGE CONTROL | AUTOMATED CHANGE IMPLEMENTATION

The organization employs automated mechanisms to implement changes to the current
information system baseline and deploys the updated baseline across the installed base.
(4)

CONFIGURATION CHANGE CONTROL | SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE

The organization requires an information security representative to be a member of the
[Assignment: organization-defined configuration change control element].
Supplemental Guidance: Information security representatives can include, for example, senior

agency information security officers, information system security officers, or information
system security managers. Representation by personnel with information security expertise is
important because changes to information system configurations can have unintended side
effects, some of which may be security-relevant. Detecting such changes early in the process
can help avoid unintended, negative consequences that could ultimately affect the security
state of organizational information systems. The configuration change control element in this
control enhancement reflects the change control elements defined by organizations in CM-3.
(5)

CONFIGURATION CHANGE CONTROL | AUTOMATED SECURITY RESPONSE
The information system implements [Assignment: organization-defined security responses]
automatically if baseline configurations are changed in an unauthorized manner.

Supplemental Guidance: Security responses include, for example, halting information system

processing, halting selected system functions, or issuing alerts/notifications to organizational
personnel when there is an unauthorized modification of a configuration item.
(6)

CONFIGURATION CHANGE CONTROL | CRYPTOGRAPHY MANAGEMENT

The organization ensures that cryptographic mechanisms used to provide [Assignment:
organization-defined security safeguards] are under configuration management.
Supplemental Guidance: Regardless of the cryptographic means employed (e.g., public key,

private key, shared secrets), organizations ensure that there are processes and procedures in
place to effectively manage those means. For example, if devices use certificates as a basis for

SECURITY IMPACT ANALYSIS
Control: The organization analyzes changes to the information system to determine potential

security impacts prior to change implementation.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizational personnel with information security responsibilities (e.g.,

Information System Administrators, Information System Security Officers, Information System
Security Managers, and Information System Security Engineers) conduct security impact analyses.
Individuals conducting security impact analyses possess the necessary skills/technical expertise to
analyze the changes to information systems and the associated security ramifications. Security
impact analysis may include, for example, reviewing security plans to understand security control
requirements and reviewing system design documentation to understand control implementation
and how specific changes might affect the controls. Security impact analyses may also include
assessments of risk to better understand the impact of the changes and to determine if additional
security controls are required. Security impact analyses are scaled in accordance with the security
categories of the information systems. Related controls: CA-2, CA-7, CM-3, CM-9, SA-4, SA-5,
SA-10, SI-2.
Control Enhancements:
(1)

SECURITY IMPACT ANALYSIS | SEPARATE TEST ENVIRONMENTS
The organization analyzes changes to the information system in a separate test environment
before implementation in an operational environment, looking for security impacts due to flaws,
weaknesses, incompatibility, or intentional malice.

Supplemental Guidance: Separate test environment in this context means an environment that is

physically or logically isolated and distinct from the operational environment. The separation
is sufficient to ensure that activities in the test environment do not impact activities in the
operational environment, and information in the operational environment is not inadvertently
transmitted to the test environment. Separate environments can be achieved by physical or
logical means. If physically separate test environments are not used, organizations determine
the strength of mechanism required when implementing logical separation (e.g., separation
achieved through virtual machines). Related controls: SA-11, SC-3, SC-7.
(2)

SECURITY IMPACT ANALYSIS | VERIFICATION OF SECURITY FUNCTIONS

The organization, after the information system is changed, checks the security functions to verify
that the functions are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired
outcome with regard to meeting the security requirements for the system.
Supplemental Guidance: Implementation is this context refers to installing changed code in the

operational information system. Related control: SA-11.

ACCESS RESTRICTIONS FOR CHANGE
Control: The organization defines, documents, approves, and enforces physical and logical access

restrictions associated with changes to the information system.
Supplemental Guidance: Any changes to the hardware, software, and/or firmware components of

information systems can potentially have significant effects on the overall security of the systems.
Therefore, organizations permit only qualified and authorized individuals to access information
systems for purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications. Organizations
maintain records of access to ensure that configuration change control is implemented and to
support after-the-fact actions should organizations discover any unauthorized changes. Access
restrictions for change also include software libraries. Access restrictions include, for example,
physical and logical access controls (see AC-3 and PE-3), workflow automation, media libraries,
abstract layers (e.g., changes implemented into third-party interfaces rather than directly into
information systems), and change windows (e.g., changes occur only during specified times,
making unauthorized changes easy to discover). Related controls: AC-3, AC-6, PE-3.
Control Enhancements:

ACCESS RESTRICTIONS FOR CHANGE | AUTOMATED ACCESS ENFORCEMENT / AUDITING

The information system enforces access restrictions and supports auditing of the enforcement
actions.
Supplemental Guidance: Related controls: AU-2, AU-12, AU-6, CM-3, CM-6.
(2)

ACCESS RESTRICTIONS FOR CHANGE | REVIEW SYSTEM CHANGES

The organization reviews information system changes [Assignment: organization-defined
frequency] and [Assignment: organization-defined circumstances] to determine whether
unauthorized changes have occurred.
Supplemental Guidance: Indications that warrant review of information system changes and the

specific circumstances justifying such reviews may be obtained from activities carried out by
organizations during the configuration change process. Related controls: AU-6, AU-7, CM-3,
CM-5, PE-6, PE-8.
(3)

ACCESS RESTRICTIONS FOR CHANGE | SIGNED COMPONENTS
The information system prevents the installation of [Assignment: organization-defined software
and firmware components] without verification that the component has been digitally signed using
a certificate that is recognized and approved by the organization.

Supplemental Guidance: Software and firmware components prevented from installation unless

signed with recognized and approved certificates include, for example, software and firmware
version updates, patches, service packs, device drivers, and basic input output system (BIOS)
updates. Organizations can identify applicable software and firmware components by type, by
specific items, or a combination of both. Digital signatures and organizational verification of
such signatures, is a method of code authentication. Related controls: CM-7, SC-13, SI-7.
(4)

ACCESS RESTRICTIONS FOR CHANGE | DUAL AUTHORIZATION

The organization enforces dual authorization for implementing changes to [Assignment:
organization-defined information system components and system-level information].
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations employ dual authorization to ensure that any changes to

selected information system components and information cannot occur unless two qualified
individuals implement such changes. The two individuals possess sufficient skills/expertise to
determine if the proposed changes are correct implementations of approved changes. Dual
authorization may also be known as two-person control. Related controls: AC-5, CM-3.
(5)

ACCESS RESTRICTIONS FOR CHANGE | LIMIT PRODUCTION / OPERATIONAL PRIVILEGES

The organization:
(a)

Limits privileges to change information system components and system-related information
within a production or operational environment; and

(b) Reviews and reevaluates privileges [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].
Supplemental Guidance: In many organizations, information systems support multiple core

missions/business functions. Limiting privileges to change information system components
with respect to operational systems is necessary because changes to a particular information

CONFIGURATION SETTINGS
Control: The organization:

a.

Establishes and documents configuration settings for information technology products
employed within the information system using [Assignment: organization-defined security
configuration checklists] that reflect the most restrictive mode consistent with operational
requirements;

b.

Implements the configuration settings;

c.

Identifies, documents, and approves any deviations from established configuration settings for
[Assignment: organization-defined information system components] based on [Assignment:
organization-defined operational requirements]; and

d.

Monitors and controls changes to the configuration settings in accordance with organizational
policies and procedures.

Supplemental Guidance: Configuration settings are the set of parameters that can be changed in

hardware, software, or firmware components of the information system that affect the security
posture and/or functionality of the system. Information technology products for which securityrelated configuration settings can be defined include, for example, mainframe computers, servers
(e.g., database, electronic mail, authentication, web, proxy, file, domain name), workstations,
input/output devices (e.g., scanners, copiers, and printers), network components (e.g., firewalls,
routers, gateways, voice and data switches, wireless access points, network appliances, sensors),
operating systems, middleware, and applications. Security-related parameters are those parameters
impacting the security state of information systems including the parameters required to satisfy
other security control requirements. Security-related parameters include, for example: (i) registry
settings; (ii) account, file, directory permission settings; and (iii) settings for functions, ports,
protocols, services, and remote connections. Organizations establish organization-wide
configuration settings and subsequently derive specific settings for information systems. The
established settings become part of the systems configuration baseline.
Common secure configurations (also referred to as security configuration checklists, lockdown
and hardening guides, security reference guides, security technical implementation guides) provide
recognized, standardized, and established benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration settings
for specific information technology platforms/products and instructions for configuring those
information system components to meet operational requirements. Common secure configurations
can be developed by a variety of organizations including, for example, information technology
product developers, manufacturers, vendors, consortia, academia, industry, federal agencies, and
other organizations in the public and private sectors. Common secure configurations include the

LEAST FUNCTIONALITY
Control: The organization:

a.

Configures the information system to provide only essential capabilities; and

b.

Prohibits or restricts the use of the following functions, ports, protocols, and/or services:
[Assignment: organization-defined prohibited or restricted functions, ports, protocols, and/or
services].

Supplemental Guidance: Information systems can provide a wide variety of functions and services.

Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential
organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions). Additionally, it is sometimes convenient
to provide multiple services from single information system components, but doing so increases
risk over limiting the services provided by any one component. Where feasible, organizations limit
component functionality to a single function per device (e.g., email servers or web servers, but not
both). Organizations review functions and services provided by information systems or individual
components of information systems, to determine which functions and services are candidates for
elimination (e.g., Voice Over Internet Protocol, Instant Messaging, auto-execute, and file sharing).
Organizations consider disabling unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports/protocols (e.g.,
Universal Serial Bus, File Transfer Protocol, and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) on information
systems to prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of information, or
unauthorized tunneling. Organizations can utilize network scanning tools, intrusion detection and
prevention systems, and end-point protections such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection

LEAST FUNCTIONALITY | PERIODIC REVIEW

The organization:
(a)

Reviews the information system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to identify
unnecessary and/or nonsecure functions, ports, protocols, and services; and

(b) Disables [Assignment: organization-defined functions, ports, protocols, and services within
the information system deemed to be unnecessary and/or nonsecure].
Supplemental Guidance: The organization can either make a determination of the relative

security of the function, port, protocol, and/or service or base the security decision on the
assessment of other entities. Bluetooth, FTP, and peer-to-peer networking are examples of
less than secure protocols. Related controls: AC-18, CM-7, IA-2.

(3)

LEAST FUNCTIONALITY | REGISTRATION COMPLIANCE

The organization ensures compliance with [Assignment: organization-defined registration
requirements for functions, ports, protocols, and services].
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations use the registration process to manage, track, and

provide oversight for information systems and implemented functions, ports, protocols, and
services.
(4)

LEAST FUNCTIONALITY | UNAUTHORIZED SOFTWARE / BLACKLISTING

The organization:
(a)

Identifies [Assignment: organization-defined software programs not authorized to execute on
the information system];

(b) Employs an allow-all, deny-by-exception policy to prohibit the execution of unauthorized
software programs on the information system; and
(c)

Reviews and updates the list of unauthorized software programs [Assignment: organizationdefined frequency].

Supplemental Guidance: The process used to identify software programs that are not authorized

to execute on organizational information systems is commonly referred to as blacklisting.
Organizations can implement CM-7 (5) instead of this control enhancement if whitelisting
(the stronger of the two policies) is the preferred approach for restricting software program
execution. Related controls: CM-6, CM-8, PM-5.

(b) Employs a deny-all, permit-by-exception policy to allow the execution of authorized software
programs on the information system; and
(c)

Reviews and updates the list of authorized software programs [Assignment: organizationdefined frequency].

Supplemental Guidance: The process used to identify software programs that are authorized to

execute on organizational information systems is commonly referred to as whitelisting. In
addition to whitelisting, organizations consider verifying the integrity of white-listed software
programs using, for example, cryptographic checksums, digital signatures, or hash functions.
Verification of white-listed software can occur either prior to execution or at system startup.

INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY
Control: The organization:

a.

b.

Develops and documents an inventory of information system components that:
1.

Accurately reflects the current information system;

2.

Includes all components within the authorization boundary of the information system;

Supplemental Guidance: Organizations may choose to implement centralized information system

component inventories that include components from all organizational information systems. In
such situations, organizations ensure that the resulting inventories include system-specific
information required for proper component accountability (e.g., information system association,
information system owner). Information deemed necessary for effective accountability of
information system components includes, for example, hardware inventory specifications,
software license information, software version numbers, component owners, and for networked
components or devices, machine names and network addresses. Inventory specifications include,
for example, manufacturer, device type, model, serial number, and physical location. Related

INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | AUTOMATED MAINTENANCE

The organization employs automated mechanisms to help maintain an up-to-date, complete,
accurate, and readily available inventory of information system components.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations maintain information system inventories to the extent

feasible. Virtual machines, for example, can be difficult to monitor because such machines are
not visible to the network when not in use. In such cases, organizations maintain as up-todate, complete, and accurate an inventory as is deemed reasonable. This control enhancement

Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement is applied in addition to the monitoring for

unauthorized remote connections and mobile devices. Monitoring for unauthorized system
components may be accomplished on an ongoing basis or by the periodic scanning of systems
for that purpose. Automated mechanisms can be implemented within information systems or
in other separate devices. Isolation can be achieved, for example, by placing unauthorized
information system components in separate domains or subnets or otherwise quarantining
such components. This type of component isolation is commonly referred to as sandboxing.
Related controls: AC-17, AC-18, AC-19, CA-7, SI-3, SI-4, SI-7, RA-5.
(4)

INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | ACCOUNTABILITY INFORMATION
The organization includes in the information system component inventory information, a means for
identifying by [Selection (one or more): name; position; role], individuals responsible/accountable
for administering those components.

Supplemental Guidance: Identifying individuals who are both responsible and accountable for

administering information system components helps to ensure that the assigned components
are properly administered and organizations can contact those individuals if some action is
required (e.g., component is determined to be the source of a breach/compromise, component
needs to be recalled/replaced, or component needs to be relocated).
(5)

INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | NO DUPLICATE ACCOUNTING OF COMPONENTS

The organization verifies that all components within the authorization boundary of the information
system are not duplicated in other information system component inventories.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement addresses the potential problem of duplicate

accounting of information system components in large or complex interconnected systems.
(6)

INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | ASSESSED CONFIGURATIONS / APPROVED DEVIATIONS

The organization includes assessed component configurations and any approved deviations to
current deployed configurations in the information system component inventory.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement focuses on configuration settings established

by organizations for information system components, the specific components that have been
assessed to determine compliance with the required configuration settings, and any approved
deviations from established configuration settings. Related controls: CM-2, CM-6.
(7)

INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | CENTRALIZED REPOSITORY

The organization provides a centralized repository for the inventory of information system
components.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations may choose to implement centralized information

system component inventories that include components from all organizational information
systems. Centralized repositories of information system component inventories provide
opportunities for efficiencies in accounting for organizational hardware, software, and
firmware assets. Such repositories may also help organizations rapidly identify the location
and responsible individuals of system components that have been compromised, breached, or
are otherwise in need of mitigation actions. Organizations ensure that the resulting centralized
inventories include system-specific information required for proper component accountability
(e.g., information system association, information system owner).
(8)

INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY | AUTOMATED LOCATION TRACKING

The organization employs automated mechanisms to support tracking of information system
components by geographic location.
Supplemental Guidance: The use of automated mechanisms to track the location of information

system components can increase the accuracy of component inventories. Such capability may
also help organizations rapidly identify the location and responsible individuals of system
components that have been compromised, breached, or are otherwise in need of mitigation
actions.

CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT PLAN
Control: The organization develops, documents, and implements a configuration management plan
for the information system that:

a.

Addresses roles, responsibilities, and configuration management processes and procedures;

b.

Establishes a process for identifying configuration items throughout the system development
life cycle and for managing the configuration of the configuration items;

c.

Defines the configuration items for the information system and places the configuration items
under configuration management; and

d.

Protects the configuration management plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.

Supplemental Guidance: Configuration management plans satisfy the requirements in configuration

management policies while being tailored to individual information systems. Such plans define
detailed processes and procedures for how configuration management is used to support system
development life cycle activities at the information system level. Configuration management plans
are typically developed during the development/acquisition phase of the system development life
cycle. The plans describe how to move changes through change management processes, how to
update configuration settings and baselines, how to maintain information system component
inventories, how to control development, test, and operational environments, and how to develop,
release, and update key documents. Organizations can employ templates to help ensure consistent
and timely development and implementation of configuration management plans. Such templates
can represent a master configuration management plan for the organization at large with subsets of
the plan implemented on a system by system basis. Configuration management approval processes
include designation of key management stakeholders responsible for reviewing and approving
proposed changes to information systems, and personnel that conduct security impact analyses
prior to the implementation of changes to the systems. Configuration items are the information
system items (hardware, software, firmware, and documentation) to be configuration-managed. As
information systems continue through the system development life cycle, new configuration items
may be identified and some existing configuration items may no longer need to be under
configuration control. Related controls: CM-2, CM-3, CM-4, CM-5, CM-8, SA-10.
Control Enhancements:

CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT PLAN | ASSIGNMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY

The organization assigns responsibility for developing the configuration management process to
organizational personnel that are not directly involved in information system development.
Supplemental Guidance: In the absence of dedicated configuration management teams assigned

within organizations, system developers may be tasked to develop configuration management
processes using personnel who are not directly involved in system development or integration.
This separation of duties ensures that organizations establish and maintain a sufficient degree
of independence between the information system development and integration processes and
configuration management processes to facilitate quality control and more effective oversight.

Supplemental Guidance: Open source software refers to software that is available in source code

form. Certain software rights normally reserved for copyright holders are routinely provided
under software license agreements that permit individuals to study, change, and improve the
software. From a security perspective, the major advantage of open source software is that it
provides organizations with the ability to examine the source code. However, there are also
various licensing issues associated with open source software including, for example, the

Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the

effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the CP family.
Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations,
policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization
level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can
be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can
be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The
procedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information
systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing
policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.

g.

Protects the contingency plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.

Supplemental Guidance: Contingency planning for information systems is part of an overall

organizational program for achieving continuity of operations for mission/business functions.
Contingency planning addresses both information system restoration and implementation of
alternative mission/business processes when systems are compromised. The effectiveness of
contingency planning is maximized by considering such planning throughout the phases of the
system development life cycle. Performing contingency planning on hardware, software, and
firmware development can be an effective means of achieving information system resiliency.
Contingency plans reflect the degree of restoration required for organizational information
systems since not all systems may need to fully recover to achieve the level of continuity of
operations desired. Information system recovery objectives reflect applicable laws, Executive
Orders, directives, policies, standards, regulations, and guidelines. In addition to information
system availability, contingency plans also address other security-related events resulting in a
reduction in mission and/or business effectiveness, such as malicious attacks compromising the
confidentiality or integrity of information systems. Actions addressed in contingency plans
include, for example, orderly/graceful degradation, information system shutdown, fallback to a
manual mode, alternate information flows, and operating in modes reserved for when systems are
under attack. By closely coordinating contingency planning with incident handling activities,
organizations can ensure that the necessary contingency planning activities are in place and
activated in the event of a security incident. Related controls: AC-14, CP-6, CP-7, CP-8, CP-9,
CP-10, IR-4, IR-8, MP-2, MP-4, MP-5, PM-8, PM-11.
Control Enhancements:

systems include, for example, Business Continuity Plans, Disaster Recovery Plans, Continuity
of Operations Plans, Crisis Communications Plans, Critical Infrastructure Plans, Cyber
Incident Response Plans, Insider Threat Implementation Plan, and Occupant Emergency
Plans.
(2)

CONTINGENCY PLAN | CAPACITY PLANNING

The organization conducts capacity planning so that necessary capacity for information
processing, telecommunications, and environmental support exists during contingency
operations.
Supplemental Guidance: Capacity planning is needed because different types of threats (e.g.,

natural disasters, targeted cyber attacks) can result in a reduction of the available processing,
telecommunications, and support services originally intended to support the organizational
missions/business functions. Organizations may need to anticipate degraded operations during
contingency operations and factor such degradation into capacity planning.

CONTINGENCY PLAN | COORDINATE WITH EXTERNAL SERVICE PROVIDERS

The organization coordinates its contingency plan with the contingency plans of external service
providers to ensure that contingency requirements can be satisfied.
Supplemental Guidance: When the capability of an organization to successfully carry out its

core missions/business functions is dependent on external service providers, developing a
timely and comprehensive contingency plan may become more challenging. In this situation,
organizations coordinate contingency planning activities with the external entities to ensure
that the individual plans reflect the overall contingency needs of the organization. Related
control: SA-9.
(8)

CONTINGENCY PLAN | IDENTIFY CRITICAL ASSETS

The organization identifies critical information system assets supporting essential missions and
business functions.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations may choose to carry out the contingency planning

activities in this control enhancement as part of organizational business continuity planning
including, for example, as part of business impact analyses. Organizations identify critical
information system assets so that additional safeguards and countermeasures can be employed
(above and beyond those safeguards and countermeasures routinely implemented) to help
ensure that organizational missions/business functions can continue to be conducted during
contingency operations. In addition, the identification of critical information assets facilitates
the prioritization of organizational resources. Critical information system assets include
technical and operational aspects. Technical aspects include, for example, information

ALTERNATE COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOLS
Control: The information system provides the capability to employ [Assignment: organizationdefined alternative communications protocols] in support of maintaining continuity of operations.
Supplemental Guidance: Contingency plans and the associated training and testing for those plans,

incorporate an alternate communications protocol capability as part of increasing the resilience of
organizational information systems. Alternate communications protocols include, for example,
switching from Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Version 4 to TCP/IP
Version 6. Switching communications protocols may affect software applications and therefore,
the potential side effects of introducing alternate communications protocols are analyzed prior to
implementation.

SAFE MODE
Control: The information system, when [Assignment: organization-defined conditions] are

safe mode of operation].
Supplemental Guidance: For information systems supporting critical missions/business functions

including, for example, military operations and weapons systems, civilian space operations,
nuclear power plant operations, and air traffic control operations (especially real-time operational
environments), organizations may choose to identify certain conditions under which those systems
revert to a predefined safe mode of operation. The safe mode of operation, which can be activated
automatically or manually, restricts the types of activities or operations information systems could
execute when those conditions are encountered. Restriction includes, for example, allowing only
certain functions that could be carried out under limited power or with reduced communications
bandwidth.

ALTERNATIVE SECURITY MECHANISMS
Control: The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined alternative or supplemental
security mechanisms] for satisfying [Assignment: organization-defined security functions] when
the primary means of implementing the security function is unavailable or compromised.
Supplemental Guidance: This control supports information system resiliency and contingency

planning/continuity of operations. To ensure mission/business continuity, organizations can
implement alternative or supplemental security mechanisms. These mechanisms may be less
effective than the primary mechanisms (e.g., not as easy to use, not as scalable, or not as secure).
However, having the capability to readily employ these alternative/supplemental mechanisms
enhances overall mission/business continuity that might otherwise be adversely impacted if
organizational operations had to be curtailed until the primary means of implementing the
functions was restored. Given the cost and level of effort required to provide such alternative
capabilities, this control would typically be applied only to critical security capabilities provided
by information systems, system components, or information system services. For example, an
organization may issue to senior executives and system administrators one-time pads in case
multifactor tokens, the organization’s standard means for secure remote authentication, is
compromised. Related control: CP-2.

Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations,
policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization
level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can
be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can
be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The

IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION (ORGANIZATIONAL USERS)
Control: The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates organizational users (or
processes acting on behalf of organizational users).
Supplemental Guidance: Organizational users include employees or individuals that organizations

deem to have equivalent status of employees (e.g., contractors, guest researchers). This control
applies to all accesses other than: (i) accesses that are explicitly identified and documented in AC14; and (ii) accesses that occur through authorized use of group authenticators without individual
authentication. Organizations may require unique identification of individuals in group accounts
(e.g., shared privilege accounts) or for detailed accountability of individual activity. Organizations
employ passwords, tokens, or biometrics to authenticate user identities, or in the case multifactor
authentication, or some combination thereof. Access to organizational information systems is
defined as either local access or network access. Local access is any access to organizational
information systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where such access is
obtained by direct connections without the use of networks. Network access is access to

APPENDIX F-IA

PAGE F-90

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

organizational information systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where such
access is obtained through network connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type
of network access that involves communication through external networks (e.g., the Internet).
Internal networks include local area networks and wide area networks. In addition, the use of
encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) for network connections between organizationcontrolled endpoints and non-organization controlled endpoints may be treated as internal
networks from the perspective of protecting the confidentiality and integrity of information
traversing the network.
Organizations can satisfy the identification and authentication requirements in this control by
complying with the requirements in Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 consistent with
the specific organizational implementation plans. Multifactor authentication requires the use of
two or more different factors to achieve authentication. The factors are defined as: (i) something
you know (e.g., password, personal identification number [PIN]); (ii) something you have (e.g.,
cryptographic identification device, token); or (iii) something you are (e.g., biometric). Multifactor
solutions that require devices separate from information systems gaining access include, for
example, hardware tokens providing time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart
cards such as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification card and the DoD common
access card. In addition to identifying and authenticating users at the information system level
(i.e., at logon), organizations also employ identification and authentication mechanisms at the
application level, when necessary, to provide increased information security. Identification and
authentication requirements for other than organizational users are described in IA-8. Related
controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-14, AC-17, AC-18, IA-4, IA-5, IA-8.
Control Enhancements:

IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | NETWORK ACCESS TO PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS

The information system implements multifactor authentication for network access to privileged
accounts.
Supplemental Guidance: Related control: AC-6.
(2)

IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | NETWORK ACCESS TO NON-PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS

The information system implements multifactor authentication for network access to nonprivileged accounts.
(3)

IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | LOCAL ACCESS TO PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS

The information system implements multifactor authentication for local access to privileged
accounts.
Supplemental Guidance: Related control: AC-6.
(4)

IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | LOCAL ACCESS TO NON-PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS

The information system implements multifactor authentication for local access to non-privileged
accounts.
(5)

IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | GROUP AUTHENTICATION

The organization requires individuals to be authenticated with an individual authenticator when a
group authenticator is employed.
Supplemental Guidance: Requiring individuals to use individual authenticators as a second level

of authentication helps organizations to mitigate the risk of using group authenticators.
(6)

IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | NETWORK ACCESS TO PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS - SEPARATE DEVICE

The information system implements multifactor authentication for network access to privileged
accounts such that one of the factors is provided by a device separate from the system gaining
access and the device meets [Assignment: organization-defined strength of mechanism
requirements].
Supplemental Guidance: Related control: AC-6.

IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | NETWORK ACCESS TO PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS - REPLAY RESISTANT

The information system implements replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for network
access to privileged accounts.
Supplemental Guidance: Authentication processes resist replay attacks if it is impractical to

achieve successful authentications by replaying previous authentication messages. Replayresistant techniques include, for example, protocols that use nonces or challenges such as
Transport Layer Security (TLS) and time synchronous or challenge-response one-time
authenticators.
(9)

IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | NETWORK ACCESS TO NON-PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS - REPLAY RESISTANT

The information system implements replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for network
access to non-privileged accounts.
Supplemental Guidance: Authentication processes resist replay attacks if it is impractical to

achieve successful authentications by recording/replaying previous authentication messages.
Replay-resistant techniques include, for example, protocols that use nonces or challenges such
as Transport Layer Security (TLS) and time synchronous or challenge-response one-time
authenticators.
(10) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | SINGLE SIGN-ON
The information system provides a single sign-on capability for [Assignment: organization-defined
information system accounts and services].
Supplemental Guidance: Single sign-on enables users to log in once and gain access to multiple

information system resources. Organizations consider the operational efficiencies provided by
single sign-on capabilities with the increased risk from disclosures of single authenticators
providing access to multiple system resources.
(11) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | REMOTE ACCESS - SEPARATE DEVICE
The information system implements multifactor authentication for remote access to privileged and
non-privileged accounts such that one of the factors is provided by a device separate from the
system gaining access and the device meets [Assignment: organization-defined strength of
mechanism requirements].
Supplemental Guidance: For remote access to privileged/non-privileged accounts, the purpose

of requiring a device that is separate from the information system gaining access for one of
the factors during multifactor authentication is to reduce the likelihood of compromising
authentication credentials stored on the system. For example, adversaries deploying malicious
code on organizational information systems can potentially compromise such credentials
resident on the system and subsequently impersonate authorized users. Related control: AC-6.
(12) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | ACCEPTANCE OF PIV CREDENTIALS
The information system accepts and electronically verifies Personal Identity Verification (PIV)
credentials.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement applies to organizations implementing

logical access control systems (LACS) and physical access control systems (PACS). Personal
Identity Verification (PIV) credentials are those credentials issued by federal agencies that
conform to FIPS Publication 201 and supporting guidance documents. OMB Memorandum
11-11 requires federal agencies to continue implementing the requirements specified in
HSPD-12 to enable agency-wide use of PIV credentials. Related controls: AU-2, PE-3, SA-4.
(13) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | OUT-OF-BAND AUTHENTICATION
The information system implements [Assignment: organization-defined out-of-band authentication]
under [Assignment: organization-defined conditions].
Supplemental Guidance: Out-of-band authentication (OOBA) refers to the use of two separate

communication paths to identify and authenticate users or devices to an information system.
The first path (i.e., the in-band path), is used to identify and authenticate users or devices, and
generally is the path through which information flows. The second path (i.e., the out-of-band
path) is used to independently verify the authentication and/or requested action. For example,
a user authenticates via a notebook computer to a remote server to which the user desires
access, and requests some action of the server via that communication path. Subsequently, the
server contacts the user via the user’s cell phone to verify that the requested action originated

from the user. The user may either confirm the intended action to an individual on the
telephone or provide an authentication code via the telephone. This type of authentication can
be employed by organizations to mitigate actual or suspected man-in the-middle attacks. The
conditions for activation can include, for example, suspicious activities, new threat indicators
or elevated threat levels, or the impact level or classification level of information in requested
transactions. Related controls: IA-10, IA-11, SC-37.

DEVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION
Control: The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates [Assignment: organization-

defined specific and/or types of devices] before establishing a [Selection (one or more): local;
remote; network] connection.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizational devices requiring unique device-to-device identification and

authentication may be defined by type, by device, or by a combination of type/device. Information
systems typically use either shared known information (e.g., Media Access Control [MAC] or
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol [TCP/IP] addresses) for device identification or
organizational authentication solutions (e.g., IEEE 802.1x and Extensible Authentication Protocol
[EAP], Radius server with EAP-Transport Layer Security [TLS] authentication, Kerberos) to
identify/authenticate devices on local and/or wide area networks. Organizations determine the
required strength of authentication mechanisms by the security categories of information systems.
Because of the challenges of applying this control on large scale, organizations are encouraged to
only apply the control to those limited number (and type) of devices that truly need to support this
capability. Related controls: AC-17, AC-18, AC-19, CA-3, IA-4, IA-5.

DEVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | CRYPTOGRAPHIC BIDIRECTIONAL AUTHENTICATION

The information system authenticates [Assignment: organization-defined specific devices and/or
types of devices] before establishing [Selection (one or more): local; remote; network] connection
using bidirectional authentication that is cryptographically based.
Supplemental Guidance: A local connection is any connection with a device communicating

without the use of a network. A network connection is any connection with a device that
communicates through a network (e.g., local area or wide area network, Internet). A remote
connection is any connection with a device communicating through an external network (e.g.,
the Internet). Bidirectional authentication provides stronger safeguards to validate the identity
of other devices for connections that are of greater risk (e.g., remote connections). Related

DEVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | DEVICE ATTESTATION

The organization ensures that device identification and authentication based on attestation is
handled by [Assignment: organization-defined configuration management process].
Supplemental Guidance: Device attestation refers to the identification and authentication of a

device based on its configuration and known operating state. This might be determined via
some cryptographic hash of the device. If device attestation is the means of identification and
authentication, then it is important that patches and updates to the device are handled via a
configuration management process such that the those patches/updates are done securely and
at the same time do not disrupt the identification and authentication to other devices.

IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT
Control: The organization manages information system identifiers by:

a.

Receiving authorization from [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] to assign
an individual, group, role, or device identifier;

b.

Selecting an identifier that identifies an individual, group, role, or device;

c.

Assigning the identifier to the intended individual, group, role, or device;

d.

Preventing reuse of identifiers for [Assignment: organization-defined time period]; and

e.

Disabling the identifier after [Assignment: organization-defined time period of inactivity].

Supplemental Guidance: Common device identifiers include, for example, media access control

(MAC), Internet protocol (IP) addresses, or device-unique token identifiers. Management of
individual identifiers is not applicable to shared information system accounts (e.g., guest and
anonymous accounts). Typically, individual identifiers are the user names of the information
system accounts assigned to those individuals. In such instances, the account management
activities of AC-2 use account names provided by IA-4. This control also addresses individual
identifiers not necessarily associated with information system accounts (e.g., identifiers used in
physical security control databases accessed by badge reader systems for access to information
systems). Preventing reuse of identifiers implies preventing the assignment of previously used
individual, group, role, or device identifiers to different individuals, groups, roles, or devices.
Related controls: AC-2, IA-2, IA-3, IA-5, IA-8, SC-37.
Control Enhancements:
(1)

IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT | PROHIBIT ACCOUNT IDENTIFIERS AS PUBLIC IDENTIFIERS
The organization prohibits the use of information system account identifiers that are the same as
public identifiers for individual electronic mail accounts.

Supplemental Guidance: Prohibiting the use of information systems account identifiers that are

the same as some public identifier such as the individual identifier section of an electronic
mail address, makes it more difficult for adversaries to guess user identifiers on organizational
information systems. Related control: AT-2.
(2)

IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT | SUPERVISOR AUTHORIZATION

The organization requires that the registration process to receive an individual identifier includes
supervisor authorization.

________________________________________________________________________________________________
(3)

IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT | MULTIPLE FORMS OF CERTIFICATION

The organization requires multiple forms of certification of individual identification be presented to
the registration authority.
Supplemental Guidance: Requiring multiple forms of identification, such as documentary

evidence or a combination of documents and biometrics, reduces the likelihood of individuals
using fraudulent identification to establish an identity, or at least increases the work factor of
potential adversaries.
(4)

IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT | IDENTIFY USER STATUS

The organization manages individual identifiers by uniquely identifying each individual as
[Assignment: organization-defined characteristic identifying individual status].
Supplemental Guidance: Characteristics identifying the status of individuals include, for

example, contractors and foreign nationals. Identifying the status of individuals by specific
characteristics provides additional information about the people with whom organizational
personnel are communicating. For example, it might be useful for a government employee to
know that one of the individuals on an email message is a contractor. Related control: AT-2.
(5)

IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT | DYNAMIC MANAGEMENT

The information system dynamically manages identifiers.
Supplemental Guidance: In contrast to conventional approaches to identification which presume

static accounts for preregistered users, many distributed information systems including, for
example, service-oriented architectures, rely on establishing identifiers at run time for entities
that were previously unknown. In these situations, organizations anticipate and provision for
the dynamic establishment of identifiers. Preestablished trust relationships and mechanisms
with appropriate authorities to validate identities and related credentials are essential. Related
control: AC-16.
(6)

IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT | CROSS-ORGANIZATION MANAGEMENT

The organization coordinates with [Assignment: organization-defined external organizations] for
cross-organization management of identifiers.
Supplemental Guidance: Cross-organization identifier management provides the capability for

organizations to appropriately identify individuals, groups, roles, or devices when conducting
cross-organization activities involving the processing, storage, or transmission of information.
(7)

IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT | IN-PERSON REGISTRATION

The organization requires that the registration process to receive an individual identifier be
conducted in person before a designated registration authority.
Supplemental Guidance: In-person registration reduces the likelihood of fraudulent identifiers

being issued because it requires the physical presence of individuals and actual face-to-face
interactions with designated registration authorities.

b.

Establishing initial authenticator content for authenticators defined by the organization;

c.

Ensuring that authenticators have sufficient strength of mechanism for their intended use;

f.

Establishing minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions and reuse conditions for
authenticators;

g.

Changing/refreshing authenticators [Assignment: organization-defined time period by
authenticator type];

h.

Protecting authenticator content from unauthorized disclosure and modification;

i.

Requiring individuals to take, and having devices implement, specific security safeguards to
protect authenticators; and

j.

Changing authenticators for group/role accounts when membership to those accounts changes.

Supplemental Guidance: Individual authenticators include, for example, passwords, tokens,

biometrics, PKI certificates, and key cards. Initial authenticator content is the actual content (e.g.,
the initial password) as opposed to requirements about authenticator content (e.g., minimum
password length). In many cases, developers ship information system components with factory
default authentication credentials to allow for initial installation and configuration. Default
authentication credentials are often well known, easily discoverable, and present a significant
security risk. The requirement to protect individual authenticators may be implemented via control
PL-4 or PS-6 for authenticators in the possession of individuals and by controls AC-3, AC-6, and
SC-28 for authenticators stored within organizational information systems (e.g., passwords stored
in hashed or encrypted formats, files containing encrypted or hashed passwords accessible with
administrator privileges). Information systems support individual authenticator management by
organization-defined settings and restrictions for various authenticator characteristics including,
for example, minimum password length, password composition, validation time window for time
synchronous one-time tokens, and number of allowed rejections during the verification stage of
biometric authentication. Specific actions that can be taken to safeguard authenticators include, for
example, maintaining possession of individual authenticators, not loaning or sharing individual
authenticators with others, and reporting lost, stolen, or compromised authenticators immediately.
Authenticator management includes issuing and revoking, when no longer needed, authenticators
for temporary access such as that required for remote maintenance. Device authenticators include,
for example, certificates and passwords. Related controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-6, CM-6, IA-2, IA-4,
IA-8, PL-4, PS-5, PS-6, SC-12, SC-13, SC-17, SC-28.
Control Enhancements:
(1)

AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | PASSWORD-BASED AUTHENTICATION

The information system, for password-based authentication:
(a)

Enforces minimum password complexity of [Assignment: organization-defined requirements
for case sensitivity, number of characters, mix of upper-case letters, lower-case letters,
numbers, and special characters, including minimum requirements for each type];

(b) Enforces at least the following number of changed characters when new passwords are
created: [Assignment: organization-defined number];
(c)

Stores and transmits only cryptographically-protected passwords;

(d) Enforces password minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions of [Assignment: organizationdefined numbers for lifetime minimum, lifetime maximum];
(e)

Prohibits password reuse for [Assignment: organization-defined number] generations; and

(f)

Allows the use of a temporary password for system logons with an immediate change to a
permanent password.

Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement applies to single-factor authentication of

individuals using passwords as individual or group authenticators, and in a similar manner,
when passwords are part of multifactor authenticators. This control enhancement does not
apply when passwords are used to unlock hardware authenticators (e.g., Personal Identity

APPENDIX F-IA

PAGE F-96

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Verification cards). The implementation of such password mechanisms may not meet all of
the requirements in the enhancement. Cryptographically-protected passwords include, for
example, encrypted versions of passwords and one-way cryptographic hashes of passwords.
The number of changed characters refers to the number of changes required with respect to
the total number of positions in the current password. Password lifetime restrictions do not
apply to temporary passwords. To mitigate certain brute force attacks against passwords,
organizations may also consider salting passwords. Related control: IA-6.
(2)

AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | PKI-BASED AUTHENTICATION

The information system, for PKI-based authentication:
(a)

Validates certifications by constructing and verifying a certification path to an accepted trust
anchor including checking certificate status information;

(b) Enforces authorized access to the corresponding private key;
(c)

Maps the authenticated identity to the account of the individual or group; and

(d) Implements a local cache of revocation data to support path discovery and validation in case
of inability to access revocation information via the network.
Supplemental Guidance: Status information for certification paths includes, for example,

certificate revocation lists or certificate status protocol responses. For PIV cards, validation of
certifications involves the construction and verification of a certification path to the Common
Policy Root trust anchor including certificate policy processing. Related control: IA-6.
(3)

AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | IN-PERSON OR TRUSTED THIRD-PARTY REGISTRATION

The organization requires that the registration process to receive [Assignment: organizationdefined types of and/or specific authenticators] be conducted [Selection: in person; by a trusted
third party] before [Assignment: organization-defined registration authority] with authorization by
[Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].
(4)

AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | AUTOMATED SUPPORT FOR PASSWORD STRENGTH DETERMINATION
The organization employs automated tools to determine if password authenticators are sufficiently
strong to satisfy [Assignment: organization-defined requirements].

Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement focuses on the creation of strong passwords

and the characteristics of such passwords (e.g., complexity) prior to use, the enforcement of
which is carried out by organizational information systems in IA-5 (1). Related controls: CA2, CA-7, RA-5.
(5)

AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | CHANGE AUTHENTICATORS PRIOR TO DELIVERY

The organization requires developers/installers of information system components to provide
unique authenticators or change default authenticators prior to delivery/installation.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement extends the requirement for organizations to

change default authenticators upon information system installation, by requiring developers
and/or installers to provide unique authenticators or change default authenticators for system
components prior to delivery and/or installation. However, it typically does not apply to the
developers of commercial off-the-shelve information technology products. Requirements for
unique authenticators can be included in acquisition documents prepared by organizations
when procuring information systems or system components.
(6)

AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | PROTECTION OF AUTHENTICATORS

The organization protects authenticators commensurate with the security category of the
information to which use of the authenticator permits access.
Supplemental Guidance: For information systems containing multiple security categories of

information without reliable physical or logical separation between categories, authenticators
used to grant access to the systems are protected commensurate with the highest security
category of information on the systems.
(7)

AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | NO EMBEDDED UNENCRYPTED STATIC AUTHENTICATORS

The organization ensures that unencrypted static authenticators are not embedded in applications
or access scripts or stored on function keys.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations exercise caution in determining whether embedded or

stored authenticators are in encrypted or unencrypted form. If authenticators are used in the

APPENDIX F-IA

manner stored, then those representations are considered unencrypted authenticators. This is
irrespective of whether that representation is perhaps an encrypted version of something else
(e.g., a password).
(8)

AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | MULTIPLE INFORMATION SYSTEM ACCOUNTS

The organization implements [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to manage
the risk of compromise due to individuals having accounts on multiple information systems.
Supplemental Guidance: When individuals have accounts on multiple information systems,

there is the risk that the compromise of one account may lead to the compromise of other
accounts if individuals use the same authenticators. Possible alternatives include, for example:
(i) having different authenticators on all systems; (ii) employing some form of single sign-on
mechanism; or (iii) including some form of one-time passwords on all systems.
(9)

AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | CROSS-ORGANIZATION CREDENTIAL MANAGEMENT

The organization coordinates with [Assignment: organization-defined external organizations] for
cross-organization management of credentials.
Supplemental Guidance: Cross-organization management of credentials provides the capability

for organizations to appropriately authenticate individuals, groups, roles, or devices when
conducting cross-organization activities involving the processing, storage, or transmission of
information.
(10) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | DYNAMIC CREDENTIAL ASSOCIATION
The information system dynamically provisions identities.
Supplemental Guidance: Authentication requires some form of binding between an identity and

the authenticator used to confirm the identity. In conventional approaches, this binding is
established by pre-provisioning both the identity and the authenticator to the information
system. For example, the binding between a username (i.e., identity) and a password (i.e.,
authenticator) is accomplished by provisioning the identity and authenticator as a pair in the
information system. New authentication techniques allow the binding between the identity
and the authenticator to be implemented outside an information system. For example, with
smartcard credentials, the identity and the authenticator are bound together on the card. Using
these credentials, information systems can authenticate identities that have not been preprovisioned, dynamically provisioning the identity after authentication. In these situations,
organizations can anticipate the dynamic provisioning of identities. Preestablished trust
relationships and mechanisms with appropriate authorities to validate identities and related
credentials are essential.
(11) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | HARDWARE TOKEN-BASED AUTHENTICATION
The information system, for hardware token-based authentication, employs mechanisms that
satisfy [Assignment: organization-defined token quality requirements].
Supplemental Guidance: Hardware token-based authentication typically refers to the use of

PKI-based tokens, such as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card.
Organizations define specific requirements for tokens, such as working with a particular PKI.
(12) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | BIOMETRIC-BASED AUTHENTICATION
The information system, for biometric-based authentication, employs mechanisms that satisfy
[Assignment: organization-defined biometric quality requirements].
Supplemental Guidance: Unlike password-based authentication which provides exact matches

of user-input passwords to stored passwords, biometric authentication does not provide such
exact matches. Depending upon the type of biometric and the type of collection mechanism,
there is likely to be some divergence from the presented biometric and stored biometric which
serves as the basis of comparison. There will likely be both false positives and false negatives
when making such comparisons. The rate at which the false accept and false reject rates are
equal is known as the crossover rate. Biometric quality requirements include, for example,
acceptable crossover rates, as that essentially reflects the accuracy of the biometric.
(13) AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT | EXPIRATION OF CACHED AUTHENTICATORS
The information system prohibits the use of cached authenticators after [Assignment:
organization-defined time period].

AUTHENTICATOR FEEDBACK
Control: The information system obscures feedback of authentication information during the

authentication process to protect the information from possible exploitation/use by unauthorized
individuals.
Supplemental Guidance: The feedback from information systems does not provide information that

would allow unauthorized individuals to compromise authentication mechanisms. For some types
of information systems or system components, for example, desktops/notebooks with relatively
large monitors, the threat (often referred to as shoulder surfing) may be significant. For other types
of systems or components, for example, mobile devices with 2-4 inch screens, this threat may be
less significant, and may need to be balanced against the increased likelihood of typographic input
errors due to the small keyboards. Therefore, the means for obscuring the authenticator feedback is
selected accordingly. Obscuring the feedback of authentication information includes, for example,
displaying asterisks when users type passwords into input devices, or displaying feedback for a
very limited time before fully obscuring it. Related control: PE-18.

IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION (NON-ORGANIZATIONAL USERS)
Control: The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates non-organizational users (or
processes acting on behalf of non-organizational users).
Supplemental Guidance: Non-organizational users include information system users other than

organizational users explicitly covered by IA-2. These individuals are uniquely identified and
authenticated for accesses other than those accesses explicitly identified and documented in AC14. In accordance with the E-Authentication E-Government initiative, authentication of nonorganizational users accessing federal information systems may be required to protect federal,
proprietary, or privacy-related information (with exceptions noted for national security systems).
Organizations use risk assessments to determine authentication needs and consider scalability,
practicality, and security in balancing the need to ensure ease of use for access to federal
information and information systems with the need to protect and adequately mitigate risk. IA-2
addresses identification and authentication requirements for access to information systems by
organizational users. Related controls: AC-2, AC-14, AC-17, AC-18, IA-2, IA-4, IA-5, MA-4,

Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement addresses open identity management

standards. To ensure that these standards are viable, robust, reliable, sustainable (e.g.,
available in commercial information technology products), and interoperable as documented,
the United States Government assesses and scopes identity management standards and
technology implementations against applicable federal legislation, directives, policies, and
requirements. The result is FICAM-issued implementation profiles of approved protocols
(e.g., FICAM authentication protocols such as SAML 2.0 and OpenID 2.0, as well as other

IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION | ACCEPTANCE OF PIV-I CREDENTIALS
The information system accepts and electronically verifies Personal Identity Verification-I (PIV-I)
credentials.

Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement: (i) applies to logical and physical access

control systems; and (ii) addresses Non-Federal Issuers (NFIs) of identity cards that desire to
interoperate with United States Government Personal Identity Verification (PIV) information
systems and that can be trusted by federal government-relying parties. The X.509 certificate
policy for the Federal Bridge Certification Authority (FBCA) addresses PIV-I requirements.
The PIV-I card is suitable for Assurance Level 4 as defined in OMB Memorandum 04-04 and
NIST Special Publication 800-63, and multifactor authentication as defined in NIST Special
Publication 800-116. PIV-I credentials are those credentials issued by a PIV-I provider whose
PIV-I certificate policy maps to the Federal Bridge PIV-I Certificate Policy. A PIV-I provider
is cross-certified (directly or through another PKI bridge) with the FBCA with policies that
have been mapped and approved as meeting the requirements of the PIV-I policies defined in
the FBCA certificate policy. Related control: AU-2.

Supplemental Guidance: This control supports service-oriented architectures and other distributed

architectural approaches requiring the identification and authentication of information system
services. In such architectures, external services often appear dynamically. Therefore, information
systems should be able to determine in a dynamic manner, if external providers and associated
services are authentic. Safeguards implemented by organizational information systems to validate

Supplemental Guidance: Adversaries may compromise individual authentication mechanisms and

subsequently attempt to impersonate legitimate users. This situation can potentially occur with any
authentication mechanisms employed by organizations. To address this threat, organizations may
employ specific techniques/mechanisms and establish protocols to assess suspicious behavior
(e.g., individuals accessing information that they do not typically access as part of their normal
duties, roles, or responsibilities, accessing greater quantities of information than the individuals
would routinely access, or attempting to access information from suspicious network addresses).
In these situations when certain preestablished conditions or triggers occur, organizations can
require selected individuals to provide additional authentication information. Another potential use
for adaptive identification and authentication is to increase the strength of mechanism based on the

INCIDENT HANDLING
Control: The organization:

a.

Implements an incident handling capability for security incidents that includes preparation,
detection and analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery;

b.

Coordinates incident handling activities with contingency planning activities; and

c.

Incorporates lessons learned from ongoing incident handling activities into incident response
procedures, training, and testing, and implements the resulting changes accordingly.

Supplemental Guidance: Organizations recognize that incident response capability is dependent on

the capabilities of organizational information systems and the mission/business processes being
supported by those systems. Therefore, organizations consider incident response as part of the
definition, design, and development of mission/business processes and information systems.
Incident-related information can be obtained from a variety of sources including, for example,
audit monitoring, network monitoring, physical access monitoring, user/administrator reports, and
reported supply chain events. Effective incident handling capability includes coordination among
many organizational entities including, for example, mission/business owners, information system
owners, authorizing officials, human resources offices, physical and personnel security offices,
legal departments, operations personnel, procurement offices, and the risk executive (function).

continuation of organizational missions and business functions.
Supplemental Guidance: Classes of incidents include, for example, malfunctions due to

design/implementation errors and omissions, targeted malicious attacks, and untargeted
malicious attacks. Appropriate incident response actions include, for example, graceful
degradation, information system shutdown, fall back to manual mode/alternative technology
whereby the system operates differently, employing deceptive measures, alternate information
flows, or operating in a mode that is reserved solely for when systems are under attack.
(4)

INCIDENT HANDLING | INFORMATION CORRELATION

The organization correlates incident information and individual incident responses to achieve an
organization-wide perspective on incident awareness and response.
Supplemental Guidance: Sometimes the nature of a threat event, for example, a hostile cyber

attack, is such that it can only be observed by bringing together information from different
sources including various reports and reporting procedures established by organizations.

INCIDENT HANDLING | INSIDER THREATS - INTRA-ORGANIZATION COORDINATION
The organization coordinates incident handling capability for insider threats across [Assignment:
organization-defined components or elements of the organization].

Supplemental Guidance: Incident handling for insider threat incidents (including preparation,

detection and analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery) requires close coordination
among a variety of organizational components or elements to be effective. These components
or elements include, for example, mission/business owners, information system owners,
human resources offices, procurement offices, personnel/physical security offices, operations
personnel, and risk executive (function). In addition, organizations may require external
support from federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies.
(8)

INCIDENT HANDLING | CORRELATION WITH EXTERNAL ORGANIZATIONS

The organization coordinates with [Assignment: organization-defined external organizations] to
correlate and share [Assignment: organization-defined incident information] to achieve a crossorganization perspective on incident awareness and more effective incident responses.
Supplemental Guidance: The coordination of incident information with external organizations

including, for example, mission/business partners, military/coalition partners, customers, and
multitiered developers, can provide significant benefits. Cross-organizational coordination
with respect to incident handling can serve as an important risk management capability. This
capability allows organizations to leverage critical information from a variety of sources to
effectively respond to information security-related incidents potentially affecting the
organization’s operations, assets, and individuals.

INFORMATION SPILLAGE RESPONSE
Control: The organization responds to information spills by:

a.

Identifying the specific information involved in the information system contamination;

b.

Alerting [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] of the information spill using
a method of communication not associated with the spill;

c.

f.

Performing other [Assignment: organization-defined actions].

Supplemental Guidance: Information spillage refers to instances where either classified or sensitive

information is inadvertently placed on information systems that are not authorized to process such
information. Such information spills often occur when information that is initially thought to be of
lower sensitivity is transmitted to an information system and then is subsequently determined to be
of higher sensitivity. At that point, corrective action is required. The nature of the organizational
response is generally based upon the degree of sensitivity of the spilled information (e.g., security
category or classification level), the security capabilities of the information system, the specific
nature of contaminated storage media, and the access authorizations (e.g., security clearances) of
individuals with authorized access to the contaminated system. The methods used to communicate
information about the spill after the fact do not involve methods directly associated with the actual
spill to minimize the risk of further spreading the contamination before such contamination is
isolated and eradicated.

(3)

INFORMATION SPILLAGE RESPONSE | POST-SPILL OPERATIONS

The organization implements [Assignment: organization-defined procedures] to ensure that
organizational personnel impacted by information spills can continue to carry out assigned tasks
while contaminated systems are undergoing corrective actions.
Supplemental Guidance: Correction actions for information systems contaminated due to

information spillages may be very time-consuming. During those periods, personnel may not
have access to the contaminated systems, which may potentially affect their ability to conduct
organizational business.
(4)

INFORMATION SPILLAGE RESPONSE | EXPOSURE TO UNAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL

The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] for personnel
exposed to information not within assigned access authorizations.
Supplemental Guidance: Security safeguards include, for example, making personnel exposed

to spilled information aware of the federal laws, directives, policies, and/or regulations
regarding the information and the restrictions imposed based on exposure to such information.

INTEGRATED INFORMATION SECURITY ANALYSIS TEAM
Control: The organization establishes an integrated team of forensic/malicious code analysts, tool

developers, and real-time operations personnel.
Supplemental Guidance: Having an integrated team for incident response facilitates information

sharing. Such capability allows organizational personnel, including developers, implementers, and
operators, to leverage the team knowledge of the threat in order to implement defensive measures
that will enable organizations to deter intrusions more effectively. Moreover, it promotes the rapid
detection of intrusions, development of appropriate mitigations, and the deployment of effective
defensive measures. For example, when an intrusion is detected, the integrated security analysis
team can rapidly develop an appropriate response for operators to implement, correlate the new
incident with information on past intrusions, and augment ongoing intelligence development. This

conducted by individuals communicating through a network, either an external network (e.g., the
Internet) or an internal network. Local maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities
carried out by individuals physically present at the information system or information system
component and not communicating across a network connection. Authentication techniques used
in the establishment of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions reflect the network access
requirements in IA-2. Typically, strong authentication requires authenticators that are resistant to
replay attacks and employ multifactor authentication. Strong authenticators include, for example,
PKI where certificates are stored on a token protected by a password, passphrase, or biometric.

Supplemental Guidance: This control applies to individuals performing hardware or software

maintenance on organizational information systems, while PE-2 addresses physical access for
individuals whose maintenance duties place them within the physical protection perimeter of the
systems (e.g., custodial staff, physical plant maintenance personnel). Technical competence of
supervising individuals relates to the maintenance performed on the information systems while
having required access authorizations refers to maintenance on and near the systems. Individuals
not previously identified as authorized maintenance personnel, such as information technology
manufacturers, vendors, systems integrators, and consultants, may require privileged access to
organizational information systems, for example, when required to conduct maintenance activities
with little or no notice. Based on organizational assessments of risk, organizations may issue
temporary credentials to these individuals. Temporary credentials may be for one-time use or for

TIMELY MAINTENANCE | PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE

The organization performs preventive maintenance on [Assignment: organization-defined
information system components] at [Assignment: organization-defined time intervals].
Supplemental Guidance: Preventive maintenance includes proactive care and servicing of

organizational information systems components for the purpose of maintaining equipment and
facilities in satisfactory operating condition. Such maintenance provides for the systematic
inspection, tests, measurements, adjustments, parts replacement, detection, and correction of
incipient failures either before they occur or before they develop into major defects. The
primary goal of preventive maintenance is to avoid/mitigate the consequences of equipment
failures. Preventive maintenance is designed to preserve and restore equipment reliability by
replacing worn components before they actually fail. Methods of determining what preventive
(or other) failure management policies to apply include, for example, original equipment
manufacturer (OEM) recommendations, statistical failure records, requirements of codes,
legislation, or regulations within a jurisdiction, expert opinion, maintenance that has already
been conducted on similar equipment, or measured values and performance indications.
(2)

TIMELY MAINTENANCE | PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE

The organization performs predictive maintenance on [Assignment: organization-defined
information system components] at [Assignment: organization-defined time intervals].
Supplemental Guidance: Predictive maintenance, or condition-based maintenance, attempts to

evaluate the condition of equipment by performing periodic or continuous (online) equipment
condition monitoring. The goal of predictive maintenance is to perform maintenance at a
scheduled point in time when the maintenance activity is most cost-effective and before the
equipment loses performance within a threshold. The predictive component of predictive
maintenance stems from the goal of predicting the future trend of the equipment's condition.
This approach uses principles of statistical process control to determine at what point in the
future maintenance activities will be appropriate. Most predictive maintenance inspections are
performed while equipment is in service, thereby minimizing disruption of normal system
operations. Predictive maintenance can result in substantial cost savings and higher system
reliability. Predictive maintenance tends to include measurement of the item. To evaluate
equipment condition, predictive maintenance utilizes nondestructive testing technologies such
as infrared, acoustic (partial discharge and airborne ultrasonic), corona detection, vibration
analysis, sound level measurements, oil analysis, and other specific online tests.
(3)

TIMELY MAINTENANCE | AUTOMATED SUPPORT FOR PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE

The organization employs automated mechanisms to transfer predictive maintenance data to a
computerized maintenance management system.
Supplemental Guidance: A computerized maintenance management system maintains a

computer database of information about the maintenance operations of organizations and
automates processing equipment condition data in order to trigger maintenance planning,
execution, and reporting.

Control: The organization:

a.

Protects and controls [Assignment: organization-defined types of information system media]
during transport outside of controlled areas using [Assignment: organization-defined security
safeguards];

b.

Maintains accountability for information system media during transport outside of controlled
areas;

c.

Documents activities associated with the transport of information system media; and

d.

Restricts the activities associated with the transport of information system media to authorized
personnel.

Supplemental Guidance: Information system media includes both digital and non-digital media.

Digital media includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard disk
drives, flash drives, compact disks, and digital video disks. Non-digital media includes, for
example, paper and microfilm. This control also applies to mobile devices with information
storage capability (e.g., smart phones, tablets, E-readers), that are transported outside of controlled
areas. Controlled areas are areas or spaces for which organizations provide sufficient physical
and/or procedural safeguards to meet the requirements established for protecting information
and/or information systems.
Physical and technical safeguards for media are commensurate with the security category or
classification of the information residing on the media. Safeguards to protect media during
transport include, for example, locked containers and cryptography. Cryptographic mechanisms
can provide confidentiality and integrity protections depending upon the mechanisms used.
Activities associated with transport include the actual transport as well as those activities such as
releasing media for transport and ensuring that media enters the appropriate transport processes.
For the actual transport, authorized transport and courier personnel may include individuals from
outside the organization (e.g., U.S. Postal Service or a commercial transport or delivery service).
Maintaining accountability of media during transport includes, for example, restricting transport
activities to authorized personnel, and tracking and/or obtaining explicit records of transport
activities as the media moves through the transportation system to prevent and detect loss,

MEDIA SANITIZATION
Control: The organization:

a.

Sanitizes [Assignment: organization-defined information system media] prior to disposal,
release out of organizational control, or release for reuse using [Assignment: organizationdefined sanitization techniques and procedures] in accordance with applicable federal and
organizational standards and policies; and

b.

Employs sanitization mechanisms with the strength and integrity commensurate with the
security category or classification of the information.

This control applies to all information system media, both digital and nondigital, subject to disposal or reuse, whether or not the media is considered removable. Examples
include media found in scanners, copiers, printers, notebook computers, workstations, network
components, and mobile devices. The sanitization process removes information from the media
such that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization techniques, including
clearing, purging, cryptographic erase, and destruction, prevent the disclosure of information to
unauthorized individuals when such media is reused or released for disposal. Organizations
determine the appropriate sanitization methods recognizing that destruction is sometimes
necessary when other methods cannot be applied to media requiring sanitization. Organizations
use discretion on the employment of approved sanitization techniques and procedures for media
containing information deemed to be in the public domain or publicly releasable, or deemed to
have no adverse impact on organizations or individuals if released for reuse or disposal.
Supplemental Guidance:

APPENDIX F-MP

PAGE F-122

Sanitization of non-digital media includes, for example, removing a classified appendix from an
otherwise unclassified document, or redacting selected sections or words from a document by
obscuring the redacted sections/words in a manner equivalent in effectiveness to removing them
from the document. NSA standards and policies control the sanitization process for media
containing classified information. Related controls: MA-2, MA-4, RA-3, SC-4.
Control Enhancements:
(1)

MEDIA SANITIZATION | REVIEW / APPROVE / TRACK / DOCUMENT / VERIFY
The organization reviews, approves, tracks, documents, and verifies media sanitization and
disposal actions.

Supplemental Guidance: Organizations review and approve media to be sanitized to ensure

compliance with records-retention policies. Tracking/documenting actions include, for
example, listing personnel who reviewed and approved sanitization and disposal actions,
types of media sanitized, specific files stored on the media, sanitization methods used, date
and time of the sanitization actions, personnel who performed the sanitization, verification
actions taken, personnel who performed the verification, and disposal action taken.
Organizations verify that the sanitization of the media was effective prior to disposal. Related

MEDIA SANITIZATION | NONDESTRUCTIVE TECHNIQUES

The organization applies nondestructive sanitization techniques to portable storage devices prior
to connecting such devices to the information system under the following circumstances:
[Assignment: organization-defined circumstances requiring sanitization of portable storage
devices].
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement applies to digital media containing classified

information and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). Portable storage devices can be
the source of malicious code insertions into organizational information systems. Many of
these devices are obtained from unknown and potentially untrustworthy sources and may
contain malicious code that can be readily transferred to information systems through USB
ports or other entry portals. While scanning such storage devices is always recommended,
sanitization provides additional assurance that the devices are free of malicious code to
include code capable of initiating zero-day attacks. Organizations consider nondestructive
sanitization of portable storage devices when such devices are first purchased from the
manufacturer or vendor prior to initial use or when organizations lose a positive chain of
custody for the devices. Related control: SI-3.

Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement protects data/information on organizational

information systems, system components, or devices (e.g., mobile devices) if such systems,
components, or devices are obtained by unauthorized individuals. Remote purge/wipe
commands require strong authentication to mitigate the risk of unauthorized individuals
purging/wiping the system/component/device. The purge/wipe function can be implemented
in a variety of ways including, for example, by overwriting data/information multiple times or
by destroying the key necessary to decrypt encrypted data.

MEDIA USE
Control: The organization [Selection: restricts; prohibits] the use of [Assignment: organization-

defined types of information system media] on [Assignment: organization-defined information
systems or system components] using [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards].
Information system media includes both digital and non-digital media.
Digital media includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard disk
drives, flash drives, compact disks, and digital video disks. Non-digital media includes, for
example, paper and microfilm. This control also applies to mobile devices with information
storage capability (e.g., smart phones, tablets, E-readers). In contrast to MP-2, which restricts user
access to media, this control restricts the use of certain types of media on information systems, for
example, restricting/prohibiting the use of flash drives or external hard disk drives. Organizations
can employ technical and nontechnical safeguards (e.g., policies, procedures, rules of behavior) to
restrict the use of information system media. Organizations may restrict the use of portable storage
devices, for example, by using physical cages on workstations to prohibit access to certain external
ports, or disabling/removing the ability to insert, read or write to such devices. Organizations may
also limit the use of portable storage devices to only approved devices including, for example,
devices provided by the organization, devices provided by other approved organizations, and
devices that are not personally owned. Finally, organizations may restrict the use of portable
storage devices based on the type of device, for example, prohibiting the use of writeable, portable
storage devices, and implementing this restriction by disabling or removing the capability to write
to such devices. Related controls: AC-19, PL-4.

problems identified during plan implementation or security control assessments; and

e.

Protects the security plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.

Supplemental Guidance: Security plans relate security requirements to a set of security controls and

control enhancements. Security plans also describe, at a high level, how the security controls and
control enhancements meet those security requirements, but do not provide detailed, technical
descriptions of the specific design or implementation of the controls/enhancements. Security plans
contain sufficient information (including the specification of parameter values for assignment and
selection statements either explicitly or by reference) to enable a design and implementation that is
unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and subsequent determinations of risk to
organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation if the plan is
implemented as intended. Organizations can also apply tailoring guidance to the security control
baselines in Appendix D and CNSS Instruction 1253 to develop overlays for community-wide use
or to address specialized requirements, technologies, or missions/environments of operation (e.g.,
DoD-tactical, Federal Public Key Infrastructure, or Federal Identity, Credential, and Access
Management, space operations). Appendix I provides guidance on developing overlays.
Security plans need not be single documents; the plans can be a collection of various documents
including documents that already exist. Effective security plans make extensive use of references
to policies, procedures, and additional documents (e.g., design and implementation specifications)
where more detailed information can be obtained. This reduces the documentation requirements
associated with security programs and maintains security-related information in other established
management/operational areas related to enterprise architecture, system development life cycle,
systems engineering, and acquisition. For example, security plans do not contain detailed
contingency plan or incident response plan information but instead provide explicitly or by
reference, sufficient information to define what needs to be accomplished by those plans. Related

a.

Establishes and makes readily available to individuals requiring access to the information
system, the rules that describe their responsibilities and expected behavior with regard to
information and information system usage;

b.

Receives a signed acknowledgment from such individuals, indicating that they have read,
understand, and agree to abide by the rules of behavior, before authorizing access to
information and the information system;

c.

Reviews and updates the rules of behavior [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and

d.

Requires individuals who have signed a previous version of the rules of behavior to read and
re-sign when the rules of behavior are revised/updated.

Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement applies to organizational users. Organizations

consider rules of behavior based on individual user roles and responsibilities, differentiating, for
example, between rules that apply to privileged users and rules that apply to general users.
Establishing rules of behavior for some types of non-organizational users including, for example,
individuals who simply receive data/information from federal information systems, is often not
feasible given the large number of such users and the limited nature of their interactions with the
systems. Rules of behavior for both organizational and non-organizational users can also be
established in AC-8, System Use Notification. PL-4 b. (the signed acknowledgment portion of this
control) may be satisfied by the security awareness training and role-based security training
programs conducted by organizations if such training includes rules of behavior. Organizations

c.

Ensures that planned information security architecture changes are reflected in the security
plan, the security Concept of Operations (CONOPS), and organizational
procurements/acquisitions.

Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses actions taken by organizations in the design and

development of information systems. The information security architecture at the individual
information system level is consistent with and complements the more global, organization-wide
information security architecture described in PM-7 that is integral to and developed as part of the
enterprise architecture. The information security architecture includes an architectural description,
the placement/allocation of security functionality (including security controls), security-related
information for external interfaces, information being exchanged across the interfaces, and the
protection mechanisms associated with each interface. In addition, the security architecture can
include other important security-related information, for example, user roles and access privileges
assigned to each role, unique security requirements, the types of information processed, stored,
and transmitted by the information system, restoration priorities of information and information
system services, and any other specific protection needs.
In today’s modern architecture, it is becoming less common for organizations to control all
information resources. There are going to be key dependencies on external information services
and service providers. Describing such dependencies in the information security architecture is
important to developing a comprehensive mission/business protection strategy. Establishing,
developing, documenting, and maintaining under configuration control, a baseline configuration
for organizational information systems is critical to implementing and maintaining an effective
information security architecture. The development of the information security architecture is
coordinated with the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) to
ensure that security controls needed to support privacy requirements are identified and effectively
implemented. PL-8 is primarily directed at organizations (i.e., internally focused) to help ensure
that organizations develop an information security architecture for the information system, and
that the security architecture is integrated with or tightly coupled to the enterprise architecture
through the organization-wide information security architecture. In contrast, SA-17 is primarily
directed at external information technology product/system developers and integrators (although
SA-17 could be used internally within organizations for in-house system development). SA-17,
which is complementary to PL-8, is selected when organizations outsource the development of
information systems or information system components to external entities, and there is a need to
demonstrate/show consistency with the organization’s enterprise architecture and information
security architecture. Related controls: CM-2, CM-6, PL-2, PM-7, SA-5, SA-17, Appendix J.
Control Enhancements:

INFORMATION SECURITY ARCHITECTURE | DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH
The organization designs its security architecture using a defense-in-depth approach that:

(a)

Allocates [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to [Assignment:
organization-defined locations and architectural layers]; and

(b) Ensures that the allocated security safeguards operate in a coordinated and mutually
reinforcing manner.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations strategically allocate security safeguards (procedural,

technical, or both) in the security architecture so that adversaries have to overcome multiple
safeguards to achieve their objective. Requiring adversaries to defeat multiple mechanisms
makes it more difficult to successfully attack critical information resources (i.e., increases
adversary work factor) and also increases the likelihood of detection. The coordination of
allocated safeguards is essential to ensure that an attack that involves one safeguard does not
create adverse unintended consequences (e.g., lockout, cascading alarms) by interfering with
another safeguard. Placement of security safeguards is a key activity. Greater asset criticality
or information value merits additional layering. Thus, an organization may choose to place
anti-virus software at organizational boundary layers, email/web servers, notebook computers,
and workstations to maximize the number of related safeguards adversaries must penetrate
before compromising the information and information systems. Related controls: SC-29, SC36.

INFORMATION SECURITY ARCHITECTURE | SUPPLIER DIVERSITY

The organization requires that [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] allocated to
[Assignment: organization-defined locations and architectural layers] are obtained from different
suppliers.
Supplemental Guidance: Different information technology products have different strengths and

weaknesses. Providing a broad spectrum of products complements the individual offerings.
For example, vendors offering malicious code protection typically update their products at
different times, often developing solutions for known viruses, Trojans, or worms according to
their priorities and development schedules. By having different products at different locations
(e.g., server, boundary, desktop) there is an increased likelihood that at least one will detect
the malicious code. Related control: SA-12.

and related processes].
Supplemental Guidance: Central management refers to the organization-wide management and

implementation of selected security controls and related processes. Central management includes
planning, implementing, assessing, authorizing, and monitoring the organization-defined, centrally
managed security controls and processes. As central management of security controls is generally
associated with common controls, such management promotes and facilitates standardization of
security control implementations and management and judicious use of organizational resources.
Centrally-managed security controls and processes may also meet independence requirements for
assessments in support of initial and ongoing authorizations to operate as part of organizational
continuous monitoring. As part of the security control selection process, organizations determine
which controls may be suitable for central management based on organizational resources and
capabilities. Organizations consider that it may not always be possible to centrally manage every
aspect of a security control. In such cases, the security control is treated as a hybrid control with
the control managed and implemented either centrally or at the information system level. Controls
and control enhancements that are candidates for full or partial central management include, but
are not limited to: AC-2 (1) (2) (3) (4); AC-17 (1) (2) (3) (9); AC-18 (1) (3) (4) (5); AC-19 (4);

Supplemental Guidance: Information system-related property includes, for example, hardware

authentication tokens, system administration technical manuals, keys, identification cards, and
building passes. Exit interviews ensure that terminated individuals understand the security
constraints imposed by being former employees and that proper accountability is achieved for
information system-related property. Security topics of interest at exit interviews can include, for
example, reminding terminated individuals of nondisclosure agreements and potential limitations
on future employment. Exit interviews may not be possible for some terminated individuals, for
example, in cases related to job abandonment, illnesses, and nonavailability of supervisors. Exit
interviews are important for individuals with security clearances. Timely execution of termination
actions is essential for individuals terminated for cause. In certain situations, organizations
consider disabling the information system accounts of individuals that are being terminated prior
to the individuals being notified. Related controls: AC-2, IA-4, PE-2, PS-5, PS-6.
Control Enhancements:

information system and the information it processes, stores, or transmits;

b.

Documents risk assessment results in [Selection: security plan; risk assessment report;

e.

Updates the risk assessment [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] or whenever there
are significant changes to the information system or environment of operation (including the
identification of new threats and vulnerabilities), or other conditions that may impact the
security state of the system.

Supplemental Guidance: Clearly defined authorization boundaries are a prerequisite for effective

risk assessments. Risk assessments take into account threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, and
impact to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation
based on the operation and use of information systems. Risk assessments also take into account
risk from external parties (e.g., service providers, contractors operating information systems on
behalf of the organization, individuals accessing organizational information systems, outsourcing
entities). In accordance with OMB policy and related E-authentication initiatives, authentication of
public users accessing federal information systems may also be required to protect nonpublic or
privacy-related information. As such, organizational assessments of risk also address public access
to federal information systems.
Risk assessments (either formal or informal) can be conducted at all three tiers in the risk
management hierarchy (i.e., organization level, mission/business process level, or information
system level) and at any phase in the system development life cycle. Risk assessments can also be
conducted at various steps in the Risk Management Framework, including categorization, security
control selection, security control implementation, security control assessment, information
system authorization, and security control monitoring. RA-3 is noteworthy in that the control must
be partially implemented prior to the implementation of other controls in order to complete the
first two steps in the Risk Management Framework. Risk assessments can play an important role
in security control selection processes, particularly during the application of tailoring guidance,
which includes security control supplementation. Related controls: RA-2, PM-9.

VULNERABILITY SCANNING
Control: The organization:

a.

Scans for vulnerabilities in the information system and hosted applications [Assignment:
organization-defined frequency and/or randomly in accordance with organization-defined
process] and when new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system/applications are
identified and reported;

b.

Employs vulnerability scanning tools and techniques that facilitate interoperability among
tools and automate parts of the vulnerability management process by using standards for:
1.

Enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations;

2.

Formatting checklists and test procedures; and

3.

Measuring vulnerability impact;

c.

Analyzes vulnerability scan reports and results from security control assessments;

d.

Remediates legitimate vulnerabilities [Assignment: organization-defined response times] in
accordance with an organizational assessment of risk; and

e.

Shares information obtained from the vulnerability scanning process and security control
assessments with [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] to help eliminate
similar vulnerabilities in other information systems (i.e., systemic weaknesses or
deficiencies).

Supplemental Guidance: Security categorization of information systems guides the frequency and

comprehensiveness of vulnerability scans. Organizations determine the required vulnerability
scanning for all information system components, ensuring that potential sources of vulnerabilities
such as networked printers, scanners, and copiers are not overlooked. Vulnerability analyses for
custom software applications may require additional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic
analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can employ these
analysis approaches in a variety of tools (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis
tools, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Vulnerability scanning includes, for example:
(i) scanning for patch levels; (ii) scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should
not be accessible to users or devices; and (iii) scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly
operating information flow control mechanisms. Organizations consider using tools that express
vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that
use the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine/test for the presence of
vulnerabilities. Suggested sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness
Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). In addition, security
control assessments such as red team exercises provide other sources of potential vulnerabilities
for which to scan. Organizations also consider using tools that express vulnerability impact by the
Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). Related controls: CA-2, CA-7, CM-4, CM-6,
RA-2, RA-3, SA-11, SI-2.

VULNERABILITY SCANNING | UPDATE TOOL CAPABILITY

The organization employs vulnerability scanning tools that include the capability to readily update
the information system vulnerabilities to be scanned.
Supplemental Guidance: The vulnerabilities to be scanned need to be readily updated as new

vulnerabilities are discovered, announced, and scanning methods developed. This updating
process helps to ensure that potential vulnerabilities in the information system are identified
and addressed as quickly as possible. Related controls: SI-3, SI-7.
(2)

VULNERABILITY SCANNING | UPDATE BY FREQUENCY / PRIOR TO NEW SCAN / WHEN IDENTIFIED

The organization updates the information system vulnerabilities scanned [Selection (one or more):

VULNERABILITY SCANNING | BREADTH / DEPTH OF COVERAGE

The organization employs vulnerability scanning procedures that can identify the breadth and
depth of coverage (i.e., information system components scanned and vulnerabilities checked).
(4)

VULNERABILITY SCANNING | DISCOVERABLE INFORMATION

The organization determines what information about the information system is discoverable by
adversaries and subsequently takes [Assignment: organization-defined corrective actions].
Supplemental Guidance: Discoverable information includes information that adversaries could

obtain without directly compromising or breaching the information system, for example, by
collecting information the system is exposing or by conducting extensive searches of the web.
Corrective actions can include, for example, notifying appropriate organizational personnel,
removing designated information, or changing the information system to make designated
information less relevant or attractive to adversaries. Related control: AU-13.

VULNERABILITY SCANNING | PRIVILEGED ACCESS

The information system implements privileged access authorization to [Assignment: organizationidentified information system components] for selected [Assignment: organization-defined
vulnerability scanning activities].
Supplemental Guidance: In certain situations, the nature of the vulnerability scanning may be

more intrusive or the information system component that is the subject of the scanning may
contain highly sensitive information. Privileged access authorization to selected system
components facilitates more thorough vulnerability scanning and also protects the sensitive
nature of such scanning.

SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE
Control: The organization:

a.

Manages the information system using [Assignment: organization-defined system
development life cycle] that incorporates information security considerations;

b.

Defines and documents information security roles and responsibilities throughout the system
development life cycle;

c.

Identifies individuals having information security roles and responsibilities; and

d.

Integrates the organizational information security risk management process into system
development life cycle activities.

Supplemental Guidance: A well-defined system development life cycle provides the foundation for

the successful development, implementation, and operation of organizational information systems.
To apply the required security controls within the system development life cycle requires a basic
understanding of information security, threats, vulnerabilities, adverse impacts, and risk to critical
missions/business functions. The security engineering principles in SA-8 cannot be properly
applied if individuals that design, code, and test information systems and system components
(including information technology products) do not understand security. Therefore, organizations
include qualified personnel, for example, chief information security officers, security architects,
security engineers, and information system security officers in system development life cycle
activities to ensure that security requirements are incorporated into organizational information
systems. It is equally important that developers include individuals on the development team that
possess the requisite security expertise and skills to ensure that needed security capabilities are
effectively integrated into the information system. Security awareness and training programs can
help ensure that individuals having key security roles and responsibilities have the appropriate
experience, skills, and expertise to conduct assigned system development life cycle activities. The
effective integration of security requirements into enterprise architecture also helps to ensure that
important security considerations are addressed early in the system development life cycle and that
those considerations are directly related to the organizational mission/business processes. This
process also facilitates the integration of the information security architecture into the enterprise
architecture, consistent with organizational risk management and information security strategies.

d.

Security-related documentation requirements;

e.

Requirements for protecting security-related documentation;

f.

Description of the information system development environment and environment in which
the system is intended to operate; and

g.

Acceptance criteria.

Supplemental Guidance: Information system components are discrete, identifiable information

technology assets (e.g., hardware, software, or firmware) that represent the building blocks of an
information system. Information system components include commercial information technology
products. Security functional requirements include security capabilities, security functions, and
security mechanisms. Security strength requirements associated with such capabilities, functions,
and mechanisms include degree of correctness, completeness, resistance to direct attack, and
resistance to tampering or bypass. Security assurance requirements include: (i) development
processes, procedures, practices, and methodologies; and (ii) evidence from development and
assessment activities providing grounds for confidence that the required security functionality has
been implemented and the required security strength has been achieved. Security documentation
requirements address all phases of the system development life cycle.
Security functionality, assurance, and documentation requirements are expressed in terms of
security controls and control enhancements that have been selected through the tailoring process.
The security control tailoring process includes, for example, the specification of parameter values
through the use of assignment and selection statements and the specification of platform
dependencies and implementation information. Security documentation provides user and
administrator guidance regarding the implementation and operation of security controls. The level
of detail required in security documentation is based on the security category or classification level
of the information system and the degree to which organizations depend on the stated security
capability, functions, or mechanisms to meet overall risk response expectations (as defined in the
organizational risk management strategy). Security requirements can also include organizationally
mandated configuration settings specifying allowed functions, ports, protocols, and services.
Acceptance criteria for information systems, information system components, and information
system services are defined in the same manner as such criteria for any organizational acquisition
or procurement. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Section 7.103 contains information
security requirements from FISMA. Related controls: CM-6, PL-2, PS-7, SA-3, SA-5, SA-8, SA11, SA-12.
Control Enhancements:

ACQUISITION PROCESS | FUNCTIONAL PROPERTIES OF SECURITY CONTROLS

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to provide a description of the functional properties of the security
controls to be employed.
Supplemental Guidance: Functional properties of security controls describe the functionality

(i.e., security capability, functions, or mechanisms) visible at the interfaces of the controls and
specifically exclude functionality and data structures internal to the operation of the controls.
Related control: SA-5.
(2)

ACQUISITION PROCESS | DESIGN / IMPLEMENTATION INFORMATION FOR SECURITY CONTROLS

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to provide design and implementation information for the security
controls to be employed that includes: [Selection (one or more): security-relevant external system
interfaces; high-level design; low-level design; source code or hardware schematics; [Assignment:
organization-defined design/implementation information]] at [Assignment: organization-defined
level of detail].

APPENDIX F-SA

PAGE F-158

________________________________________________________________________________________________
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations may require different levels of detail in design and

implementation documentation for security controls employed in organizational information
systems, system components, or information system services based on mission/business
requirements, requirements for trustworthiness/resiliency, and requirements for analysis and
testing. Information systems can be partitioned into multiple subsystems. Each subsystem
within the system can contain one or more modules. The high-level design for the system is
expressed in terms of multiple subsystems and the interfaces between subsystems providing
security-relevant functionality. The low-level design for the system is expressed in terms of
modules with particular emphasis on software and firmware (but not excluding hardware) and
the interfaces between modules providing security-relevant functionality. Source code and
hardware schematics are typically referred to as the implementation representation of the
information system. Related control: SA-5.
(3)

ACQUISITION PROCESS | DEVELOPMENT METHODS / TECHNIQUES / PRACTICES

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to demonstrate the use of a system development life cycle that
includes [Assignment: organization-defined state-of-the-practice system/security engineering
methods, software development methods, testing/evaluation/validation techniques, and quality
control processes].
Supplemental Guidance: Following a well-defined system development life cycle that includes

state-of-the-practice software development methods, systems/security engineering methods,
quality control processes, and testing, evaluation, and validation techniques helps to reduce
the number and severity of latent errors within information systems, system components, and
information system services. Reducing the number/severity of such errors reduces the number
of vulnerabilities in those systems, components, and services. Related control: SA-12.

(a)

Deliver the system, component, or service with [Assignment: organization-defined security
configurations] implemented; and

(b) Use the configurations as the default for any subsequent system, component, or service
reinstallation or upgrade.
Supplemental Guidance: Security configurations include, for example, the U.S. Government

Configuration Baseline (USGCB) and any limitations on functions, ports, protocols, and
services. Security characteristics include, for example, requiring that all default passwords
have been changed. Related control: CM-8.
(6)

ACQUISITION PROCESS | USE OF INFORMATION ASSURANCE PRODUCTS

The organization:
(a)

Employs only government off-the-shelf (GOTS) or commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)
information assurance (IA) and IA-enabled information technology products that compose an
NSA-approved solution to protect classified information when the networks used to transmit
the information are at a lower classification level than the information being transmitted; and

(b) Ensures that these products have been evaluated and/or validated by NSA or in accordance
with NSA-approved procedures.
Supplemental Guidance: COTS IA or IA-enabled information technology products used to

protect classified information by cryptographic means may be required to use NSA-approved
key management. Related controls: SC-8, SC-12, SC-13.

(b) Requires, if no NIAP-approved Protection Profile exists for a specific technology type but a
commercially provided information technology product relies on cryptographic functionality
to enforce its security policy, that the cryptographic module is FIPS-validated.
Supplemental Guidance: Related controls: SC-12, SC-13.
(8)

ACQUISITION PROCESS | CONTINUOUS MONITORING PLAN
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to produce a plan for the continuous monitoring of security control
effectiveness that contains [Assignment: organization-defined level of detail].

Supplemental Guidance: The objective of continuous monitoring plans is to determine if the

complete set of planned, required, and deployed security controls within the information
system, system component, or information system service continue to be effective over time
based on the inevitable changes that occur. Developer continuous monitoring plans include a
sufficient level of detail such that the information can be incorporated into the continuous
monitoring strategies and programs implemented by organizations. Related control: CA-7.
(9)

ACQUISITION PROCESS | FUNCTIONS / PORTS / PROTOCOLS / SERVICES IN USE

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to identify early in the system development life cycle, the functions,
ports, protocols, and services intended for organizational use.
Supplemental Guidance: The identification of functions, ports, protocols, and services early in

the system development life cycle (e.g., during the initial requirements definition and design
phases) allows organizations to influence the design of the information system, information
system component, or information system service. This early involvement in the life cycle
helps organizations to avoid or minimize the use of functions, ports, protocols, or services that
pose unnecessarily high risks and understand the trade-offs involved in blocking specific
ports, protocols, or services (or when requiring information system service providers to do
so). Early identification of functions, ports, protocols, and services avoids costly retrofitting
of security controls after the information system, system component, or information system
service has been implemented. SA-9 describes requirements for external information system
services with organizations identifying which functions, ports, protocols, and services are
provided from external sources. Related controls: CM-7, SA-9.

1.

User-accessible security functions/mechanisms and how to effectively use those security
functions/mechanisms;

2.

Methods for user interaction, which enables individuals to use the system, component, or
service in a more secure manner; and

3.

User responsibilities in maintaining the security of the system, component, or service;

c.

takes [Assignment: organization-defined actions] in response;

d.

Protects documentation as required, in accordance with the risk management strategy; and

e.

Distributes documentation to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].

Supplemental Guidance: This control helps organizational personnel understand the implementation

and operation of security controls associated with information systems, system components, and
information system services. Organizations consider establishing specific measures to determine
the quality/completeness of the content provided. The inability to obtain needed documentation
may occur, for example, due to the age of the information system/component or lack of support
from developers and contractors. In those situations, organizations may need to recreate selected
documentation if such documentation is essential to the effective implementation or operation of
security controls. The level of protection provided for selected information system, component, or
service documentation is commensurate with the security category or classification of the system.
For example, documentation associated with a key DoD weapons system or command and control
system would typically require a higher level of protection than a routine administrative system.
Documentation that addresses information system vulnerabilities may also require an increased
level of protection. Secure operation of the information system, includes, for example, initially
starting the system and resuming secure system operation after any lapse in system operation.

SECURITY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES
Control: The organization applies information system security engineering principles in the
specification, design, development, implementation, and modification of the information system.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations apply security engineering principles primarily to new

development information systems or systems undergoing major upgrades. For legacy systems,
organizations apply security engineering principles to system upgrades and modifications to the
extent feasible, given the current state of hardware, software, and firmware within those systems.
Security engineering principles include, for example: (i) developing layered protections; (ii)
establishing sound security policy, architecture, and controls as the foundation for design; (iii)
incorporating security requirements into the system development life cycle; (iv) delineating
physical and logical security boundaries; (v) ensuring that system developers are trained on how to
build secure software; (vi) tailoring security controls to meet organizational and operational needs;
(vii) performing threat modeling to identify use cases, threat agents, attack vectors, and attack
patterns as well as compensating controls and design patterns needed to mitigate risk; and (viii)
reducing risk to acceptable levels, thus enabling informed risk management decisions. Related

EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEM SERVICES
Control: The organization:

a.

Requires that providers of external information system services comply with organizational
information security requirements and employ [Assignment: organization-defined security
controls] in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies,
regulations, standards, and guidance;

b.

Defines and documents government oversight and user roles and responsibilities with regard
to external information system services; and

c.

Employs [Assignment: organization-defined processes, methods, and techniques] to monitor
security control compliance by external service providers on an ongoing basis.

Supplemental Guidance: External information system services are services that are implemented

outside of the authorization boundaries of organizational information systems. This includes
services that are used by, but not a part of, organizational information systems. FISMA and OMB
policy require that organizations using external service providers that are processing, storing, or
transmitting federal information or operating information systems on behalf of the federal
government ensure that such providers meet the same security requirements that federal agencies
are required to meet. Organizations establish relationships with external service providers in a
variety of ways including, for example, through joint ventures, business partnerships, contracts,
interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, and supply chain
exchanges. The responsibility for managing risks from the use of external information system
services remains with authorizing officials. For services external to organizations, a chain of trust
requires that organizations establish and retain a level of confidence that each participating

provider in the potentially complex consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection
for the services rendered. The extent and nature of this chain of trust varies based on the
relationships between organizations and the external providers. Organizations document the basis
for trust relationships so the relationships can be monitored over time. External information
system services documentation includes government, service providers, end user security roles and
responsibilities, and service-level agreements. Service-level agreements define expectations of
performance for security controls, describe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies and
response requirements for identified instances of noncompliance. Related controls: CA-3, IR-7,
PS-7.
Control Enhancements:
(1)

EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | RISK ASSESSMENTS / ORGANIZATIONAL APPROVALS

The organization:
(a)

Conducts an organizational assessment of risk prior to the acquisition or outsourcing of
dedicated information security services; and

(b) Ensures that the acquisition or outsourcing of dedicated information security services is
approved by [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].
Supplemental Guidance: Dedicated information security services include, for example, incident

monitoring, analysis and response, operation of information security-related devices such as
firewalls, or key management services. Related controls: CA-6, RA-3.
(2)

EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | IDENTIFICATION OF FUNCTIONS / PORTS / PROTOCOLS / SERVICES
The organization requires providers of [Assignment: organization-defined external information
system services] to identify the functions, ports, protocols, and other services required for the use
of such services.

Supplemental Guidance: Information from external service providers regarding the specific

functions, ports, protocols, and services used in the provision of such services can be
particularly useful when the need arises to understand the trade-offs involved in restricting
certain functions/services or blocking certain ports/protocols. Related control: CM-7.
(3)

EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | ESTABLISH / MAINTAIN TRUST RELATIONSHIP WITH PROVIDERS

The organization establishes, documents, and maintains trust relationships with external service
providers based on [Assignment: organization-defined security requirements, properties, factors,
or conditions defining acceptable trust relationships].
Supplemental Guidance: The degree of confidence that the risk from using external services is

at an acceptable level depends on the trust that organizations place in the external providers,
individually or in combination. Trust relationships can help organization to gain increased
levels of confidence that participating service providers are providing adequate protection for
the services rendered. Such relationships can be complicated due to the number of potential
entities participating in the consumer-provider interactions, subordinate relationships and
levels of trust, and the types of interactions between the parties. In some cases, the degree of
trust is based on the amount of direct control organizations are able to exert on external
service providers with regard to employment of security controls necessary for the protection
of the service/information and the evidence brought forth as to the effectiveness of those
controls. The level of control is typically established by the terms and conditions of the
contracts or service-level agreements and can range from extensive control (e.g., negotiating
contracts or agreements that specify security requirements for the providers) to very limited
control (e.g., using contracts or service-level agreements to obtain commodity services such as
commercial telecommunications services). In other cases, levels of trust are based on factors
that convince organizations that required security controls have been employed and that
determinations of control effectiveness exist. For example, separately authorized external
information system services provided to organizations through well-established business
relationships may provide degrees of trust in such services within the tolerable risk range of
the organizations using the services. External service providers may also outsource selected
services to other external entities, making the trust relationship more difficult and complicated
to manage. Depending on the nature of the services, organizations may find it very difficult to

APPENDIX F-SA

PAGE F-163

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

place significant trust in external providers. This is not due to any inherent untrustworthiness
on the part of providers, but to the intrinsic level of risk in the services.
(4)

EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | CONSISTENT INTERESTS OF CONSUMERS AND PROVIDERS
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to ensure that
the interests of [Assignment: organization-defined external service providers] are consistent with
and reflect organizational interests.

Supplemental Guidance: As organizations increasingly use external service providers, the

possibility exists that the interests of the service providers may diverge from organizational
interests. In such situations, simply having the correct technical, procedural, or operational
safeguards in place may not be sufficient if the service providers that implement and control
those safeguards are not operating in a manner consistent with the interests of the consuming
organizations. Possible actions that organizations might take to address such concerns include,
for example, requiring background checks for selected service provider personnel, examining
ownership records, employing only trustworthy service providers (i.e., providers with which
organizations have had positive experiences), and conducting periodic/unscheduled visits to
service provider facilities.
(5)

EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS | PROCESSING, STORAGE, AND SERVICE LOCATION

The organization restricts the location of [Selection (one or more): information processing;
information/data; information system services] to [Assignment: organization-defined locations]
based on [Assignment: organization-defined requirements or conditions].
Supplemental Guidance: The location of information processing, information/data storage, or

information system services that are critical to organizations can have a direct impact on the
ability of those organizations to successfully execute their missions/business functions. This
situation exists when external providers control the location of processing, storage or services.
The criteria external providers use for the selection of processing, storage, or service locations
may be different from organizational criteria. For example, organizations may want to ensure
that data/information storage locations are restricted to certain locations to facilitate incident
response activities (e.g., forensic analyses, after-the-fact investigations) in case of information
security breaches/compromises. Such incident response activities may be adversely affected
by the governing laws or protocols in the locations where processing and storage occur and/or
the locations from which information system services emanate.

________________________________________________________________________________________________
Supplemental Guidance: This control also applies to organizations conducting internal information

systems development and integration. Organizations consider the quality and completeness of the
configuration management activities conducted by developers as evidence of applying effective
security safeguards. Safeguards include, for example, protecting from unauthorized modification
or destruction, the master copies of all material used to generate security-relevant portions of the
system hardware, software, and firmware. Maintaining the integrity of changes to the information
system, information system component, or information system service requires configuration
control throughout the system development life cycle to track authorized changes and prevent
unauthorized changes. Configuration items that are placed under configuration management (if
existence/use is required by other security controls) include: the formal model; the functional,
high-level, and low-level design specifications; other design data; implementation documentation;
source code and hardware schematics; the running version of the object code; tools for comparing
new versions of security-relevant hardware descriptions and software/firmware source code with
previous versions; and test fixtures and documentation. Depending on the mission/business needs
of organizations and the nature of the contractual relationships in place, developers may provide
configuration management support during the operations and maintenance phases of the life cycle.
Related controls: CM-3, CM-4, CM-9, SA-12, SI-2.
Control Enhancements:

DEVELOPER CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT | SOFTWARE / FIRMWARE INTEGRITY VERIFICATION
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to enable integrity verification of software and firmware components.

Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement allows organizations to detect unauthorized

changes to software and firmware components through the use of tools, techniques, and/or
mechanisms provided by developers. Integrity checking mechanisms can also address
counterfeiting of software and firmware components. Organizations verify the integrity of
software and firmware components, for example, through secure one-way hashes provided by
developers. Delivered software and firmware components also include any updates to such
components. Related control: SI-7.
(2)

DEVELOPER CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT | ALTERNATIVE CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT PROCESSES

The organization provides an alternate configuration management process using organizational
personnel in the absence of a dedicated developer configuration management team.
Supplemental Guidance: Alternate configuration management processes may be required, for

example, when organizations use commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) information technology
products. Alternate configuration management processes include organizational personnel
that: (i) are responsible for reviewing/approving proposed changes to information systems,
system components, and information system services; and (ii) conduct security impact
analyses prior to the implementation of any changes to systems, components, or services (e.g.,
a configuration control board that considers security impacts of changes during development
and includes representatives of both the organization and the developer, when applicable).
(3)

DEVELOPER CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT | HARDWARE INTEGRITY VERIFICATION

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to enable integrity verification of hardware components.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement allows organizations to detect unauthorized

changes to hardware components through the use of tools, techniques, and/or mechanisms
provided by developers. Organizations verify the integrity of hardware components, for
example, with hard-to-copy labels and verifiable serial numbers provided by developers, and
by requiring the implementation of anti-tamper technologies. Delivered hardware components
also include updates to such components. Related control: SI-7.
(4)

DEVELOPER CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT | TRUSTED GENERATION

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or

DEVELOPER CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT | MAPPING INTEGRITY FOR VERSION CONTROL

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to maintain the integrity of the mapping between the master build data
(hardware drawings and software/firmware code) describing the current version of securityrelevant hardware, software, and firmware and the on-site master copy of the data for the current
version.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement addresses changes to hardware, software,

and firmware components during initial development and during system life cycle updates.
Maintaining the integrity between the master copies of security-relevant hardware, software,
and firmware (including designs and source code) and the equivalent data in master copies
on-site in operational environments is essential to ensure the availability of organizational
information systems supporting critical missions and/or business functions.
(6)

DEVELOPER CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT | TRUSTED DISTRIBUTION

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to execute procedures for ensuring that security-relevant hardware,
software, and firmware updates distributed to the organization are exactly as specified by the
master copies.
Supplemental Guidance: The trusted distribution of security-relevant hardware, software, and

firmware updates helps to ensure that such updates are faithful representations of the master
copies maintained by the developer and have not been tampered with during distribution.

DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION
Control: The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or

information system service to:
a.

Create and implement a security assessment plan;

b.

Perform [Selection (one or more): unit; integration; system; regression] testing/evaluation at
[Assignment: organization-defined depth and coverage];

c.

Produce evidence of the execution of the security assessment plan and the results of the
security testing/evaluation;

d.

Implement a verifiable flaw remediation process; and

e.

Correct flaws identified during security testing/evaluation.

Supplemental Guidance: Developmental security testing/evaluation occurs at all post-design phases

of the system development life cycle. Such testing/evaluation confirms that the required security
controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, enforcing the desired security policy,
and meeting established security requirements. Security properties of information systems may be
affected by the interconnection of system components or changes to those components. These
interconnections or changes (e.g., upgrading or replacing applications and operating systems) may
adversely affect previously implemented security controls. This control provides additional types
of security testing/evaluation that developers can conduct to reduce or eliminate potential flaws.
Testing custom software applications may require approaches such as static analysis, dynamic

analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Developers can employ these
analysis approaches in a variety of tools (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis
tools, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Security assessment plans provide the specific
activities that developers plan to carry out including the types of analyses, testing, evaluation, and
reviews of software and firmware components, the degree of rigor to be applied, and the types of
artifacts produced during those processes. The depth of security testing/evaluation refers to the
rigor and level of detail associated with the assessment process (e.g., black box, gray box, or white
box testing). The coverage of security testing/evaluation refers to the scope (i.e., number and type)
of the artifacts included in the assessment process. Contracts specify the acceptance criteria for
security assessment plans, flaw remediation processes, and the evidence that the plans/processes
have been diligently applied. Methods for reviewing and protecting assessment plans, evidence,
and documentation are commensurate with the security category or classification level of the
information system. Contracts may specify documentation protection requirements. Related
controls: CA-2, CM-4, SA-3, SA-4, SA-5, SI-2.
Control Enhancements:

DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | STATIC CODE ANALYSIS

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to employ static code analysis tools to identify common flaws and
document the results of the analysis.
Supplemental Guidance: Static code analysis provides a technology and methodology for

security reviews. Such analysis can be used to identify security vulnerabilities and enforce
security coding practices. Static code analysis is most effective when used early in the
development process, when each code change can be automatically scanned for potential
weaknesses. Static analysis can provide clear remediation guidance along with defects to
enable developers to fix such defects. Evidence of correct implementation of static analysis
can include, for example, aggregate defect density for critical defect types, evidence that
defects were inspected by developers or security professionals, and evidence that defects were
fixed. An excessively high density of ignored findings (commonly referred to as ignored or
false positives) indicates a potential problem with the analysis process or tool. In such cases,
organizations weigh the validity of the evidence against evidence from other sources.
(2)

DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | THREAT AND VULNERABILITY ANALYSES

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to perform threat and vulnerability analyses and subsequent
testing/evaluation of the as-built system, component, or service.
Supplemental Guidance: Applications may deviate significantly from the functional and design

specifications created during the requirements and design phases of the system development
life cycle. Therefore, threat and vulnerability analyses of information systems, system
components, and information system services prior to delivery are critical to the effective
operation of those systems, components, and services. Threat and vulnerability analyses at
this phase of the life cycle help to ensure that design or implementation changes have been
accounted for, and that any new vulnerabilities created as a result of those changes have been
reviewed and mitigated. Related controls: PM-15, RA-5.
(3)

DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION OF ASSESSMENT PLANS /
EVIDENCE

The organization:
(a)

Requires an independent agent satisfying [Assignment: organization-defined independence
criteria] to verify the correct implementation of the developer security assessment plan and
the evidence produced during security testing/evaluation; and

(b) Ensures that the independent agent is either provided with sufficient information to complete
the verification process or granted the authority to obtain such information.
Supplemental Guidance: Independent agents have the necessary qualifications (i.e., expertise,

skills, training, and experience) to verify the correct implementation of developer security
assessment plans. Related controls: AT-3, CA-7, RA-5, SA-12.

DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | MANUAL CODE REVIEWS

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to perform a manual code review of [Assignment: organization-defined
specific code] using [Assignment: organization-defined processes, procedures, and/or
techniques].
Supplemental Guidance: Manual code reviews are usually reserved for the critical software and

firmware components of information systems. Such code reviews are uniquely effective at
identifying weaknesses that require knowledge of the application’s requirements or context
which are generally unavailable to more automated analytic tools and techniques such as
static or dynamic analysis. Components benefiting from manual review include for example,
verifying access control matrices against application controls and reviewing more detailed
aspects of cryptographic implementations and controls.
(5)

DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | PENETRATION TESTING

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to perform penetration testing at [Assignment: organization-defined
breadth/depth] and with [Assignment: organization-defined constraints].
Supplemental Guidance: Penetration testing is an assessment methodology in which assessors,

using all available information technology product and/or information system documentation
(e.g., product/system design specifications, source code, and administrator/operator manuals)
and working under specific constraints, attempt to circumvent implemented security features
of information technology products and information systems. Penetration testing can include,
for example, white, gray, or black box testing with analyses performed by skilled security
professionals simulating adversary actions. The objective of penetration testing is to uncover
potential vulnerabilities in information technology products and information systems resulting
from implementation errors, configuration faults, or other operational deployment weaknesses
or deficiencies. Penetration tests can be performed in conjunction with automated and manual
code reviews to provide greater levels of analysis than would ordinarily be possible.
(6)

DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | ATTACK SURFACE REVIEWS
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to perform attack surface reviews.

Supplemental Guidance: Attack surfaces of information systems are exposed areas that make

those systems more vulnerable to cyber attacks. This includes any accessible areas where
weaknesses or deficiencies in information systems (including the hardware, software, and
firmware components) provide opportunities for adversaries to exploit vulnerabilities. Attack
surface reviews ensure that developers: (i) analyze both design and implementation changes
to information systems; and (ii) mitigate attack vectors generated as a result of the changes.
Correction of identified flaws includes, for example, deprecation of unsafe functions.
(7)

DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | VERIFY SCOPE OF TESTING / EVALUATION
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to verify that the scope of security testing/evaluation provides
complete coverage of required security controls at [Assignment: organization-defined depth of
testing/evaluation].

Supplemental Guidance: Verifying that security testing/evaluation provides complete coverage

of required security controls can be accomplished by a variety of analytic techniques ranging
from informal to formal. Each of these techniques provides an increasing level of assurance
corresponding to the degree of formality of the analysis. Rigorously demonstrating security
control coverage at the highest levels of assurance can be provided by the use of formal
modeling and analysis techniques including correlation between control implementation and
corresponding test cases.
(8)

DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING AND EVALUATION | DYNAMIC CODE ANALYSIS
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to employ dynamic code analysis tools to identify common flaws and
document the results of the analysis.

Supplemental Guidance: Dynamic code analysis provides run-time verification of software

programs, using tools capable of monitoring programs for memory corruption, user privilege

APPENDIX F-SA

issues, and other potential security problems. Dynamic code analysis employs run-time tools
to help to ensure that security functionality performs in the manner in which it was designed.
A specialized type of dynamic analysis, known as fuzz testing, induces program failures by
deliberately introducing malformed or random data into software programs. Fuzz testing
strategies derive from the intended use of applications and the functional and design
specifications for the applications. To understand the scope of dynamic code analysis and
hence the assurance provided, organizations may also consider conducting code coverage
analysis (checking the degree to which the code has been tested using metrics such as percent
of subroutines tested or percent of program statements called during execution of the test
suite) and/or concordance analysis (checking for words that are out of place in software code
such as non-English language words or derogatory terms).

SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION
Control: The organization protects against supply chain threats to the information system, system
component, or information system service by employing [Assignment: organization-defined
security safeguards] as part of a comprehensive, defense-in-breadth information security strategy.
Supplemental Guidance: Information systems (including system components that compose those

systems) need to be protected throughout the system development life cycle (i.e., during design,
development, manufacturing, packaging, assembly, distribution, system integration, operations,
maintenance, and retirement). Protection of organizational information systems is accomplished
through threat awareness, by the identification, management, and reduction of vulnerabilities at
each phase of the life cycle and the use of complementary, mutually reinforcing strategies to
respond to risk. Organizations consider implementing a standardized process to address supply
chain risk with respect to information systems and system components, and to educate the
acquisition workforce on threats, risk, and required security controls. Organizations use the
acquisition/procurement processes to require supply chain entities to implement necessary security
safeguards to: (i) reduce the likelihood of unauthorized modifications at each stage in the supply
chain; and (ii) protect information systems and information system components, prior to taking
delivery of such systems/components. This control also applies to information system services.
Security safeguards include, for example: (i) security controls for development systems,
development facilities, and external connections to development systems; (ii) vetting development
personnel; and (iii) use of tamper-evident packaging during shipping/warehousing. Methods for
reviewing and protecting development plans, evidence, and documentation are commensurate with
the security category or classification level of the information system. Contracts may specify
documentation protection requirements. Related controls: AT-3, CM-8, IR-4, PE-16, PL-8, SA-3,

SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | ACQUISITION STRATEGIES / TOOLS / METHODS

The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined tailored acquisition strategies,
contract tools, and procurement methods] for the purchase of the information system, system
component, or information system service from suppliers.
Supplemental Guidance: The use of acquisition and procurement processes by organizations

early in the system development life cycle provides an important vehicle to protect the supply
chain. Organizations use available all-source intelligence analysis to inform the tailoring of
acquisition strategies, tools, and methods. There are a number of different tools and
techniques available (e.g., obscuring the end use of an information system or system

component, using blind or filtered buys). Organizations also consider creating incentives for
suppliers who: (i) implement required security safeguards; (ii) promote transparency into their
organizational processes and security practices; (iii) provide additional vetting of the
processes and security practices of subordinate suppliers, critical information system
components, and services; (iv) restrict purchases from specific suppliers or countries; and (v)
provide contract language regarding the prohibition of tainted or counterfeit components. In
addition, organizations consider minimizing the time between purchase decisions and required
delivery to limit opportunities for adversaries to corrupt information system components or
products. Finally, organizations can use trusted/controlled distribution, delivery, and
warehousing options to reduce supply chain risk (e.g., requiring tamper-evident packaging of
information system components during shipping and warehousing). Related control: SA-19.
(2)

SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | SUPPLIER REVIEWS

The organization conducts a supplier review prior to entering into a contractual agreement to
acquire the information system, system component, or information system service.
Supplemental Guidance: Supplier reviews include, for example: (i) analysis of supplier

processes used to design, develop, test, implement, verify, deliver, and support information
systems, system components, and information system services; and (ii) assessment of supplier
training and experience in developing systems, components, or services with the required
security capability. These reviews provide organizations with increased levels of visibility
into supplier activities during the system development life cycle to promote more effective
supply chain risk management. Supplier reviews can also help to determine whether primary
suppliers have security safeguards in place and a practice for vetting subordinate suppliers, for
example, second- and third-tier suppliers, and any subcontractors.

SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | LIMITATION OF HARM

The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to limit harm
from potential adversaries identifying and targeting the organizational supply chain.
Supplemental Guidance: Supply chain risk is part of the advanced persistent threat (APT).

Security safeguards and countermeasures to reduce the probability of adversaries successfully
identifying and targeting the supply chain include, for example: (i) avoiding the purchase of
custom configurations to reduce the risk of acquiring information systems, components, or
products that have been corrupted via supply chain actions targeted at specific organizations;
(ii) employing a diverse set of suppliers to limit the potential harm from any given supplier in
the supply chain; (iii) employing approved vendor lists with standing reputations in industry,
and (iv) using procurement carve outs (i.e., exclusions to commitments or obligations).

SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | ASSESSMENTS PRIOR TO SELECTION / ACCEPTANCE / UPDATE

The organization conducts an assessment of the information system, system component, or
information system service prior to selection, acceptance, or update.
Supplemental Guidance: Assessments include, for example, testing, evaluations, reviews, and

analyses. Independent, third-party entities or organizational personnel conduct assessments of
systems, components, products, tools, and services. Organizations conduct assessments to
uncover unintentional vulnerabilities and intentional vulnerabilities including, for example,
malicious code, malicious processes, defective software, and counterfeits. Assessments can
include, for example, static analyses, dynamic analyses, simulations, white, gray, and black
box testing, fuzz testing, penetration testing, and ensuring that components or services are
genuine (e.g., using tags, cryptographic hash verifications, or digital signatures). Evidence
generated during security assessments is documented for follow-on actions carried out by
organizations. Related controls: CA-2, SA-11.

SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | USE OF ALL-SOURCE INTELLIGENCE

The organization uses all-source intelligence analysis of suppliers and potential suppliers of the
information system, system component, or information system service.
Supplemental Guidance: All-source intelligence analysis is employed by organizations to

inform engineering, acquisition, and risk management decisions. All-source intelligence
consists of intelligence products and/or organizations and activities that incorporate all
sources of information, most frequently including human intelligence, imagery intelligence,
measurement and signature intelligence, signals intelligence, and open source data in the
production of finished intelligence. Where available, such information is used to analyze the
risk of both intentional and unintentional vulnerabilities from development, manufacturing,
and delivery processes, people, and the environment. This review is performed on suppliers at
multiple tiers in the supply chain sufficient to manage risks. Related control: SA-15.
(9)

SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | OPERATIONS SECURITY

The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined Operations Security (OPSEC)
safeguards] in accordance with classification guides to protect supply chain-related information
for the information system, system component, or information system service.
Supplemental Guidance: Supply chain information includes, for example: user identities; uses

for information systems, information system components, and information system services;
supplier identities; supplier processes; security requirements; design specifications; testing
and evaluation results; and system/component configurations. This control enhancement
expands the scope of OPSEC to include suppliers and potential suppliers. OPSEC is a process
of identifying critical information and subsequently analyzing friendly actions attendant to
operations and other activities to: (i) identify those actions that can be observed by potential
adversaries; (ii) determine indicators that adversaries might obtain that could be interpreted or
pieced together to derive critical information in sufficient time to cause harm to organizations;
(iii) implement safeguards or countermeasures to eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level,
exploitable vulnerabilities; and (iv) consider how aggregated information may compromise
the confidentiality of users or uses of the supply chain. OPSEC may require organizations to
withhold critical mission/business information from suppliers and may include the use of
intermediaries to hide the end use, or users, of information systems, system components, or
information system services.
(10) SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | VALIDATE AS GENUINE AND NOT ALTERED
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to validate that
the information system or system component received is genuine and has not been altered.
Supplemental Guidance: For some information system components, especially hardware, there

are technical means to help determine if the components are genuine or have been altered.
Security safeguards used to validate the authenticity of information systems and information
system components include, for example, optical/nanotechnology tagging and side-channel
analysis. For hardware, detailed bill of material information can highlight the elements with
embedded logic complete with component and production location.
(11) SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | PENETRATION TESTING / ANALYSIS OF ELEMENTS, PROCESSES, AND ACTORS
The organization employs [Selection (one or more): organizational analysis, independent thirdparty analysis, organizational penetration testing, independent third-party penetration testing] of
[Assignment: organization-defined supply chain elements, processes, and actors] associated with
the information system, system component, or information system service.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement addresses analysis and/or testing of the

supply chain, not just delivered items. Supply chain elements are information technology
products or product components that contain programmable logic and that are critically
important to information system functions. Supply chain processes include, for example: (i)
hardware, software, and firmware development processes; (ii) shipping/handling procedures;
(iii) personnel and physical security programs; (iv) configuration management tools/measures
to maintain provenance; or (v) any other programs, processes, or procedures associated with
the production/distribution of supply chain elements. Supply chain actors are individuals with
specific roles and responsibilities in the supply chain. The evidence generated during analyses

APPENDIX F-SA

and testing of supply chain elements, processes, and actors is documented and used to inform
organizational risk management activities and decisions. Related control: RA-5.
(12) SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | INTER-ORGANIZATIONAL AGREEMENTS
The organization establishes inter-organizational agreements and procedures with entities
involved in the supply chain for the information system, system component, or information system
service.
Supplemental Guidance: The establishment of inter-organizational agreements and procedures

provides for notification of supply chain compromises. Early notification of supply chain
compromises that can potentially adversely affect or have adversely affected organizational
information systems, including critical system components, is essential for organizations to
provide appropriate responses to such incidents.
(13) SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | CRITICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENTS
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to ensure an
adequate supply of [Assignment: organization-defined critical information system components].
Supplemental Guidance: Adversaries can attempt to impede organizational operations by

disrupting the supply of critical information system components or corrupting supplier
operations. Safeguards to ensure adequate supplies of critical information system components
include, for example: (i) the use of multiple suppliers throughout the supply chain for the
identified critical components; and (ii) stockpiling of spare components to ensure operation
during mission-critical times.
(14) SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | IDENTITY AND TRACEABILITY
The organization establishes and retains unique identification of [Assignment: organizationdefined supply chain elements, processes, and actors] for the information system, system
component, or information system service.
Supplemental Guidance: Knowing who and what is in the supply chains of organizations is

critical to gaining visibility into what is happening within such supply chains, as well as
monitoring and identifying high-risk events and activities. Without reasonable visibility and
traceability into supply chains (i.e., elements, processes, and actors), it is very difficult for
organizations to understand and therefore manage risk, and to reduce the likelihood of adverse
events. Uniquely identifying acquirer and integrator roles, organizations, personnel, mission
and element processes, testing and evaluation procedures, delivery mechanisms, support
mechanisms, communications/delivery paths, and disposal/final disposition activities as well
as the components and tools used, establishes a foundational identity structure for assessment
of supply chain activities. For example, labeling (using serial numbers) and tagging (using
radio-frequency identification [RFID] tags) individual supply chain elements including
software packages, modules, and hardware devices, and processes associated with those
elements can be used for this purpose. Identification methods are sufficient to support the
provenance in the event of a supply chain issue or adverse supply chain event.
(15) SUPPLY CHAIN PROTECTION | PROCESSES TO ADDRESS WEAKNESSES OR DEFICIENCIES
The organization establishes a process to address weaknesses or deficiencies in supply chain
elements identified during independent or organizational assessments of such elements.
Supplemental Guidance: Evidence generated during independent or organizational assessments

of supply chain elements (e.g., penetration testing, audits, verification/validation activities) is
documented and used in follow-on processes implemented by organizations to respond to the
risks related to the identified weaknesses and deficiencies. Supply chain elements include, for
example, supplier development processes and supplier distribution systems.

TRUSTWORTHINESS
Control: The organization:

a.

Describes the trustworthiness required in the [Assignment: organization-defined information
system, information system component, or information system service] supporting its critical
missions/business functions; and

b.

Implements [Assignment: organization-defined assurance overlay] to achieve such
trustworthiness.

Supplemental Guidance: This control helps organizations to make explicit trustworthiness decisions

when designing, developing, and implementing information systems that are needed to conduct
critical organizational missions/business functions. Trustworthiness is a characteristic/property of
an information system that expresses the degree to which the system can be expected to preserve
the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information it processes, stores, or
transmits. Trustworthy information systems are systems that are capable of being trusted to
operate within defined levels of risk despite the environmental disruptions, human errors, and
purposeful attacks that are expected to occur in the specified environments of operation.
Trustworthy systems are important to mission/business success. Two factors affecting the
trustworthiness of information systems include: (i) security functionality (i.e., the security
features, functions, and/or mechanisms employed within the system and its environment of
operation); and (ii) security assurance (i.e., the grounds for confidence that the security
functionality is effective in its application). Developers, implementers, operators, and maintainers
of organizational information systems can increase the level of assurance (and trustworthiness),
for example, by employing well-defined security policy models, structured and rigorous hardware,
software, and firmware development techniques, sound system/security engineering principles,
and secure configuration settings (defined by a set of assurance-related security controls in
Appendix E).
Assurance is also based on the assessment of evidence produced during the system development
life cycle. Critical missions/business functions are supported by high-impact systems and the
associated assurance requirements for such systems. The additional assurance controls in Table E4 in Appendix E (designated as optional) can be used to develop and implement high-assurance
solutions for specific information systems and system components using the concept of overlays
described in Appendix I. Organizations select assurance overlays that have been developed,
validated, and approved for community adoption (e.g., cross-organization, governmentwide),
limiting the development of such overlays on an organization-by-organization basis. Organizations
can conduct criticality analyses as described in SA-14, to determine the information systems,
system components, or information system services that require high-assurance solutions.
Trustworthiness requirements and assurance overlays can be described in the security plans for
organizational information systems. Related controls: RA-2, SA-4, SA-8, SA-14, SC-3.

________________________________________________________________________________________________
Supplemental Guidance: Criticality analysis is a key tenet of supply chain risk management and

informs the prioritization of supply chain protection activities such as attack surface reduction, use
of all-source intelligence, and tailored acquisition strategies. Information system engineers can
conduct an end-to-end functional decomposition of an information system to identify missioncritical functions and components. The functional decomposition includes the identification of
core organizational missions supported by the system, decomposition into the specific functions to
perform those missions, and traceability to the hardware, software, and firmware components that
implement those functions, including when the functions are shared by many components within
and beyond the information system boundary. Information system components that allow for
unmediated access to critical components or functions are considered critical due to the inherent
vulnerabilities such components create. Criticality is assessed in terms of the impact of the
function or component failure on the ability of the component to complete the organizational
missions supported by the information system. A criticality analysis is performed whenever an
architecture or design is being developed or modified, including upgrades. Related controls: CP-2,
PL-2, PL-8, PM-1, SA-8, SA-12, SA-13, SA-15, SA-20.

b.

Requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system
service to follow a documented development process that:
1.

Explicitly addresses security requirements;

2.

Identifies the standards and tools used in the development process;

3.

Documents the specific tool options and tool configurations used in the development
process; and

4.

Documents, manages, and ensures the integrity of changes to the process and/or tools
used in development; and

Reviews the development process, standards, tools, and tool options/configurations
[Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to determine if the process, standards, tools,
and tool options/configurations selected and employed can satisfy [Assignment: organizationdefined security requirements].

Supplemental Guidance: Development tools include, for example, programming languages and

computer-aided design (CAD) systems. Reviews of development processes can include, for
example, the use of maturity models to determine the potential effectiveness of such processes.
Maintaining the integrity of changes to tools and processes enables accurate supply chain risk
assessment and mitigation, and requires robust configuration control throughout the life cycle
(including design, development, transport, delivery, integration, and maintenance) to track
authorized changes and prevent unauthorized changes. Related controls: SA-3, SA-8.

DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | QUALITY METRICS
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to:

(a)

Define quality metrics at the beginning of the development process; and

(b) Provide evidence of meeting the quality metrics [Selection (one or more): [Assignment:
organization-defined frequency]; [Assignment: organization-defined program review
milestones]; upon delivery].
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations use quality metrics to establish minimum acceptable

levels of information system quality. Metrics may include quality gates which are collections
of completion criteria or sufficiency standards representing the satisfactory execution of
particular phases of the system development project. A quality gate, for example, may require
the elimination of all compiler warnings or an explicit determination that the warnings have
no impact on the effectiveness of required security capabilities. During the execution phases
of development projects, quality gates provide clear, unambiguous indications of progress.
Other metrics apply to the entire development project. These metrics can include defining the
severity thresholds of vulnerabilities, for example, requiring no known vulnerabilities in the
delivered information system with a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) severity
of Medium or High.

DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | SECURITY TRACKING TOOLS

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to select and employ a security tracking tool for use during the
development process.

development life cycle].
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement provides developer input to the criticality

analysis performed by organizations in SA-14. Developer input is essential to such analysis
because organizations may not have access to detailed design documentation for information
system components that are developed as commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) information

thresholds].
Supplemental Guidance: Attack surface reduction is closely aligned with developer threat and

vulnerability analyses and information system architecture and design. Attack surface
reduction is a means of reducing risk to organizations by giving attackers less opportunity to
exploit weaknesses or deficiencies (i.e., potential vulnerabilities) within information systems,

and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

information system components, and information system services. Attack surface reduction
includes, for example, applying the principle of least privilege, employing layered defenses,
applying the principle of least functionality (i.e., restricting ports, protocols, functions, and
services), deprecating unsafe functions, and eliminating application programming interfaces
(APIs) that are vulnerable to cyber attacks. Related control: CM-7.
(6)

DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to implement an explicit process to continuously improve the
development process.
Supplemental Guidance: Developers of information systems, information system components,

and information system services consider the effectiveness/efficiency of current development
processes for meeting quality objectives and addressing security capabilities in current threat
environments.
(7)

DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | AUTOMATED VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to:
(a)

Perform an automated vulnerability analysis using [Assignment: organization-defined tools];

(b) Determine the exploitation potential for discovered vulnerabilities;
(c)

Determine potential risk mitigations for delivered vulnerabilities; and

(d) Deliver the outputs of the tools and results of the analysis to [Assignment: organizationdefined personnel or roles].
Supplemental Guidance: Related control: RA-5.

DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | REUSE OF THREAT / VULNERABILITY INFORMATION

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to use threat modeling and vulnerability analyses from similar systems,
components, or services to inform the current development process.
Supplemental Guidance: Analysis of vulnerabilities found in similar software applications can

inform potential design or implementation issues for information systems under development.
Similar information systems or system components may exist within developer organizations.
Authoritative vulnerability information is available from a variety of public and private sector
sources including, for example, the National Vulnerability Database.
(9)

DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | USE OF LIVE DATA

The organization approves, documents, and controls the use of live data in development and test
environments for the information system, system component, or information system service.
Supplemental Guidance: The use of live data in preproduction environments can result in

significant risk to organizations. Organizations can minimize such risk by using test or
dummy data during the development and testing of information systems, information system
components, and information system services.
(10) DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | INCIDENT RESPONSE PLAN
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to provide an incident response plan.
Supplemental Guidance: The incident response plan for developers of information systems,

system components, and information system services is incorporated into organizational
incident response plans to provide the type of incident response information not readily
available to organizations. Such information may be extremely helpful, for example, when
organizations respond to vulnerabilities in commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) information
technology products. Related control: IR-8.
(11) DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, STANDARDS, AND TOOLS | ARCHIVE INFORMATION SYSTEM / COMPONENT
The organization requires the developer of the information system or system component to archive
the system or component to be released or delivered together with the corresponding evidence
supporting the final security review.

of personnel is an essential element to ensure the effectiveness of security controls implemented
within organizational information systems. Training options include, for example, classroom-style
training, web-based/computer-based training, and hands-on training. Organizations can also

DEVELOPER SECURITY ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN
Control: The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or

information system service to produce a design specification and security architecture that:
a.

Is consistent with and supportive of the organization’s security architecture which is
established within and is an integrated part of the organization’s enterprise architecture;

b.

Accurately and completely describes the required security functionality, and the allocation of
security controls among physical and logical components; and

c.

Expresses how individual security functions, mechanisms, and services work together to
provide required security capabilities and a unified approach to protection.

Supplemental Guidance: This control is primarily directed at external developers, although it could

also be used for internal (in-house) development. In contrast, PL-8 is primarily directed at internal
developers to help ensure that organizations develop an information security architecture and such
security architecture is integrated or tightly coupled to the enterprise architecture. This distinction
is important if/when organizations outsource the development of information systems, information
system components, or information system services to external entities, and there is a requirement
to demonstrate consistency with the organization’s enterprise architecture and information security
architecture. Related controls: PL-8, PM-7, SA-3, SA-8.

DEVELOPER SECURITY ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN | FORMAL POLICY MODEL
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to:

(a)

Produce, as an integral part of the development process, a formal policy model describing the
[Assignment: organization-defined elements of organizational security policy] to be enforced;
and

(b) Prove that the formal policy model is internally consistent and sufficient to enforce the
defined elements of the organizational security policy when implemented.
Supplemental Guidance: Formal models describe specific behaviors or security policies using

formal languages, thus enabling the correctness of those behaviors/policies to be formally
proven. Not all components of information systems can be modeled, and generally, formal
specifications are scoped to specific behaviors or policies of interest (e.g., nondiscretionary
access control policies). Organizations choose the particular formal modeling language and
approach based on the nature of the behaviors/policies to be described and the available tools.
Formal modeling tools include, for example, Gypsy and Zed.

DEVELOPER SECURITY ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN | SECURITY-RELEVANT COMPONENTS
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to:

(a)

Define security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware; and

(b) Provide a rationale that the definition for security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware is
complete.
Supplemental Guidance: Security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware represent the

portion of the information system, component, or service that must be trusted to perform
correctly in order to maintain required security properties. Related control: SA-5.
(3)

DEVELOPER SECURITY ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN | FORMAL CORRESPONDENCE

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to:
(a)

Produce, as an integral part of the development process, a formal top-level specification that
specifies the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware in terms of
exceptions, error messages, and effects;

(b) Show via proof to the extent feasible with additional informal demonstration as necessary,
that the formal top-level specification is consistent with the formal policy model;
(c)

Show via informal demonstration, that the formal top-level specification completely covers the
interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware;

(d) Show that the formal top-level specification is an accurate description of the implemented
security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware; and
(e)

Describe the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware mechanisms not addressed
in the formal top-level specification but strictly internal to the security-relevant hardware,
software, and firmware.

Supplemental Guidance: Correspondence is an important part of the assurance gained through

modeling. It demonstrates that the implementation is an accurate transformation of the model,
and that any additional code or implementation details present have no impact on the
behaviors or policies being modeled. Formal methods can be used to show that the high-level
security properties are satisfied by the formal information system description, and that the
formal system description is correctly implemented by a description of some lower level, for
example a hardware description. Consistency between the formal top-level specification and
the formal policy models is generally not amenable to being fully proven. Therefore, a
combination of formal/informal methods may be needed to show such consistency.
Consistency between the formal top-level specification and the implementation may require
the use of an informal demonstration due to limitations in the applicability of formal methods
to prove that the specification accurately reflects the implementation. Hardware, software, and
firmware mechanisms strictly internal to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware

DEVELOPER SECURITY ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN | INFORMAL CORRESPONDENCE
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
information system service to:

(a)

Produce, as an integral part of the development process, an informal descriptive top-level
specification that specifies the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and
firmware in terms of exceptions, error messages, and effects;

(b) Show via [Selection: informal demonstration, convincing argument with formal methods as
feasible] that the descriptive top-level specification is consistent with the formal policy model;
(c)

Show via informal demonstration, that the descriptive top-level specification completely
covers the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware;

(d) Show that the descriptive top-level specification is an accurate description of the interfaces to
security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware; and
(e)

Describe the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware mechanisms not addressed
in the descriptive top-level specification but strictly internal to the security-relevant hardware,
software, and firmware.

Supplemental Guidance: Correspondence is an important part of the assurance gained through

modeling. It demonstrates that the implementation is an accurate transformation of the model,
and that any additional code or implementation details present has no impact on the behaviors
or policies being modeled. Consistency between the descriptive top-level specification (i.e.,
high-level/low-level design) and the formal policy model is generally not amenable to being
fully proven. Therefore, a combination of formal/informal methods may be needed to show
such consistency. Hardware, software, and firmware mechanisms strictly internal to securityrelevant hardware, software, and firmware include, for example, mapping registers and direct

Control: The organization implements a tamper protection program for the information system,
system component, or information system service.
Supplemental Guidance: Anti-tamper technologies and techniques provide a level of protection for

critical information systems, system components, and information technology products against a
number of related threats including modification, reverse engineering, and substitution. Strong

TAMPER RESISTANCE AND DETECTION | MULTIPLE PHASES OF SDLC

The organization employs anti-tamper technologies and techniques during multiple phases in the
system development life cycle including design, development, integration, operations, and

Supplemental Guidance: Organizations use a combination of hardware and software techniques

for tamper resistance and detection. Organizations employ obfuscation and self-checking, for
example, to make reverse engineering and modifications more difficult, time-consuming, and
expensive for adversaries. Customization of information systems and system components can

cannot be trusted due to specific threats to and vulnerabilities in those components, and for which
there are no viable security controls to adequately mitigate the resulting risk. Re-implementation
or custom development of such components helps to satisfy requirements for higher assurance.
This is accomplished by initiating changes to system components (including hardware, software,
and firmware) such that the standard attacks by adversaries are less likely to succeed. In situations
where no alternative sourcing is available and organizations choose not to re-implement or custom
develop critical information system components, additional safeguards can be employed (e.g.,
enhanced auditing, restrictions on source code and system utility access, and protection from

components required to satisfy mission/business needs.

Supplemental Guidance: Support for information system components includes, for example,

software patches, firmware updates, replacement parts, and maintenance contracts. Unsupported
components (e.g., when vendors are no longer providing critical software patches), provide a
substantial opportunity for adversaries to exploit new weaknesses discovered in the currently
installed components. Exceptions to replacing unsupported system components may include, for

Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement addresses the need to provide continued

support for selected information system components that are no longer supported by the
original developers, vendors, or manufacturers when such components remain essential to
mission/business operations. Organizations can establish in-house support, for example, by
developing customized patches for critical software components or secure the services of
external providers who through contractual relationships, provide ongoing support for the
designated unsupported components. Such contractual relationships can include, for example,
Open Source Software value-added vendors.

SYSTEM AND SERVICES ACQUISITION CONTROLS
DEVELOPMENT OF SYSTEMS, COMPONENTS, AND SERVICES

With the renewed emphasis on trustworthy information systems and supply chain security, it is
essential that organizations have the capability to express their information security requirements
with clarity and specificity in order to engage the information technology industry and obtain the
systems, components, and services necessary for mission and business success. To ensure that
organizations have such capability, this publication provides a set of security controls in the System
and Services Acquisition family (i.e., SA family) addressing requirements for the development of
information systems, information technology products, and information system services. Therefore,
many of the controls in the SA family are directed at developers of those systems, components, and
services. It is important for organizations to recognize that the scope of the security controls in the
SA family includes all system/component/service development and the developers associated with
such development whether the development is conducted by internal organizational personnel or by
external developers through the contracting/acquisition process. Affected controls include SA-8,
SA-10, SA-11, SA-15, SA-16, SA-17, SA-20, and SA-21.

effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the SC family.
Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations,
policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization
level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can
be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can
be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The
procedures can be established for the security program in general and for particular information
systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing
policy and procedures. Related control: PM-9.

APPLICATION PARTITIONING
Control: The information system separates user functionality (including user interface services)

from information system management functionality.
Supplemental Guidance: Information system management functionality includes, for example,

functions necessary to administer databases, network components, workstations, or servers, and
typically requires privileged user access. The separation of user functionality from information
system management functionality is either physical or logical. Organizations implement separation
of system management-related functionality from user functionality by using different computers,
different central processing units, different instances of operating systems, different network
addresses, virtualization techniques, or combinations of these or other methods, as appropriate.
This type of separation includes, for example, web administrative interfaces that use separate
authentication methods for users of any other information system resources. Separation of system
and user functionality may include isolating administrative interfaces on different domains and
with additional access controls. Related controls: SA-4, SA-8, SC-3.

Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement ensures that administration options (e.g.,

administrator privileges) are not available to general users (including prohibiting the use of
the grey-out option commonly used to eliminate accessibility to such information). Such
restrictions include, for example, not presenting administration options until users establish
sessions with administrator privileges. Related control: AC-3.

SECURITY FUNCTION ISOLATION
Control: The information system isolates security functions from nonsecurity functions.
Supplemental Guidance: The information system isolates security functions from nonsecurity

functions by means of an isolation boundary (implemented via partitions and domains). Such
isolation controls access to and protects the integrity of the hardware, software, and firmware that
perform those security functions. Information systems implement code separation (i.e., separation
of security functions from nonsecurity functions) in a number of ways, including, for example,
through the provision of security kernels via processor rings or processor modes. For non-kernel
code, security function isolation is often achieved through file system protections that serve to
protect the code on disk, and address space protections that protect executing code. Information
systems restrict access to security functions through the use of access control mechanisms and by
implementing least privilege capabilities. While the ideal is for all of the code within the security
function isolation boundary to only contain security-relevant code, it is sometimes necessary to
include nonsecurity functions within the isolation boundary as an exception. Related controls: AC3, AC-6, SA-4, SA-5, SA-8, SA-13, SC-2, SC-7, SC-39.
Control Enhancements:
(1)

SECURITY FUNCTION ISOLATION | HARDWARE SEPARATION

The information system utilizes underlying hardware separation mechanisms to implement
security function isolation.
Supplemental Guidance: Underlying hardware separation mechanisms include, for example,

hardware ring architectures, commonly implemented within microprocessors, and hardwareenforced address segmentation used to support logically distinct storage objects with separate
attributes (i.e., readable, writeable).
(2)

SECURITY FUNCTION ISOLATION | ACCESS / FLOW CONTROL FUNCTIONS

The information system isolates security functions enforcing access and information flow control
from nonsecurity functions and from other security functions.
Supplemental Guidance: Security function isolation occurs as a result of implementation; the

functions can still be scanned and monitored. Security functions that are potentially isolated
from access and flow control enforcement functions include, for example, auditing, intrusion
detection, and anti-virus functions.
(3)

SECURITY FUNCTION ISOLATION | MINIMIZE NONSECURITY FUNCTIONALITY

The organization minimizes the number of nonsecurity functions included within the isolation
boundary containing security functions.
Supplemental Guidance: In those instances where it is not feasible to achieve strict isolation of

nonsecurity functions from security functions, it is necessary to take actions to minimize the
nonsecurity-relevant functions within the security function boundary. Nonsecurity functions

APPENDIX F-SC

PAGE F-185

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________

contained within the isolation boundary are considered security-relevant because errors or
maliciousness in such software, by virtue of being within the boundary, can impact the
security functions of organizational information systems. The design objective is that the
specific portions of information systems providing information security are of minimal
size/complexity. Minimizing the number of nonsecurity functions in the security-relevant
components of information systems allows designers and implementers to focus only on those
functions which are necessary to provide the desired security capability (typically access
enforcement). By minimizing nonsecurity functions within the isolation boundaries, the
amount of code that must be trusted to enforce security policies is reduced, thus contributing
to understandability.
(4)

SECURITY FUNCTION ISOLATION | MODULE COUPLING AND COHESIVENESS

The organization implements security functions as largely independent modules that maximize
internal cohesiveness within modules and minimize coupling between modules.
Supplemental Guidance: The reduction in inter-module interactions helps to constrain security

functions and to manage complexity. The concepts of coupling and cohesion are important
with respect to modularity in software design. Coupling refers to the dependencies that one
module has on other modules. Cohesion refers to the relationship between the different
functions within a particular module. Good software engineering practices rely on modular
decomposition, layering, and minimization to reduce and manage complexity, thus producing
software modules that are highly cohesive and loosely coupled.
(5)

SECURITY FUNCTION ISOLATION | LAYERED STRUCTURES

The organization implements security functions as a layered structure minimizing interactions
between layers of the design and avoiding any dependence by lower layers on the functionality or
correctness of higher layers.
Supplemental Guidance: The implementation of layered structures with minimized interactions

among security functions and non-looping layers (i.e., lower-layer functions do not depend on
higher-layer functions) further enables the isolation of security functions and management of
complexity.

INFORMATION IN SHARED RESOURCES
Control: The information system prevents unauthorized and unintended information transfer via

shared system resources.
Supplemental Guidance: This control prevents information, including encrypted representations of

information, produced by the actions of prior users/roles (or the actions of processes acting on
behalf of prior users/roles) from being available to any current users/roles (or current processes)
that obtain access to shared system resources (e.g., registers, main memory, hard disks) after those
resources have been released back to information systems. The control of information in shared
resources is also commonly referred to as object reuse and residual information protection. This
control does not address: (i) information remanence which refers to residual representation of data
that has been nominally erased or removed; (ii) covert channels (including storage and/or timing
channels) where shared resources are manipulated to violate information flow restrictions; or (iii)
components within information systems for which there are only single users/roles. Related

DENIAL OF SERVICE PROTECTION
Control: The information system protects against or limits the effects of the following types of

denial of service attacks: [Assignment: organization-defined types of denial of service attacks or
references to sources for such information] by employing [Assignment: organization-defined
security safeguards].
Supplemental Guidance: A variety of technologies exist to limit, or in some cases, eliminate the

effects of denial of service attacks. For example, boundary protection devices can filter certain
types of packets to protect information system components on internal organizational networks
from being directly affected by denial of service attacks. Employing increased capacity and
bandwidth combined with service redundancy may also reduce the susceptibility to denial of
service attacks. Related controls: SC-6, SC-7.
Control Enhancements:
(1)

DENIAL OF SERVICE PROTECTION | RESTRICT INTERNAL USERS

The information system restricts the ability of individuals to launch [Assignment: organizationdefined denial of service attacks] against other information systems.
Supplemental Guidance: Restricting the ability of individuals to launch denial of service attacks

requires that the mechanisms used for such attacks are unavailable. Individuals of concern can
include, for example, hostile insiders or external adversaries that have successfully breached
the information system and are using the system as a platform to launch cyber attacks on third
parties. Organizations can restrict the ability of individuals to connect and transmit arbitrary
information on the transport medium (i.e., network, wireless spectrum). Organizations can
also limit the ability of individuals to use excessive information system resources. Protection
against individuals having the ability to launch denial of service attacks may be implemented
on specific information systems or on boundary devices prohibiting egress to potential target
systems.
(2)

DENIAL OF SERVICE PROTECTION | EXCESS CAPACITY / BANDWIDTH / REDUNDANCY

The information system manages excess capacity, bandwidth, or other redundancy to limit the
effects of information flooding denial of service attacks.
Supplemental Guidance: Managing excess capacity ensures that sufficient capacity is available

to counter flooding attacks. Managing excess capacity may include, for example, establishing
selected usage priorities, quotas, or partitioning.

(b) Monitors [Assignment: organization-defined information system resources] to determine if
sufficient resources exist to prevent effective denial of service attacks.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations consider utilization and capacity of information system

resources when managing risk from denial of service due to malicious attacks. Denial of
service attacks can originate from external or internal sources. Information system resources
sensitive to denial of service include, for example, physical disk storage, memory, and CPU
cycles. Common safeguards to prevent denial of service attacks related to storage utilization
and capacity include, for example, instituting disk quotas, configuring information systems to
automatically alert administrators when specific storage capacity thresholds are reached, using
file compression technologies to maximize available storage space, and imposing separate
partitions for system and user data. Related controls: CA-7, SI-4.

Supplemental Guidance: Priority protection helps prevent lower-priority processes from delaying or

interfering with the information system servicing any higher-priority processes. Quotas prevent
users or processes from obtaining more than predetermined amounts of resources. This control

BOUNDARY PROTECTION
Control: The information system:

a.

Monitors and controls communications at the external boundary of the system and at key
internal boundaries within the system;

b.

Implements subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are [Selection:
physically; logically] separated from internal organizational networks; and

c.

Connects to external networks or information systems only through managed interfaces
consisting of boundary protection devices arranged in accordance with an organizational
security architecture.

Supplemental Guidance: Managed interfaces include, for example, gateways, routers, firewalls,

guards, network-based malicious code analysis and virtualization systems, or encrypted tunnels
implemented within a security architecture (e.g., routers protecting firewalls or application
gateways residing on protected subnetworks). Subnetworks that are physically or logically
separated from internal networks are referred to as demilitarized zones or DMZs. Restricting or
prohibiting interfaces within organizational information systems includes, for example, restricting
external web traffic to designated web servers within managed interfaces and prohibiting external

traffic that appears to be spoofing internal addresses. Organizations consider the shared nature of
commercial telecommunications services in the implementation of security controls associated
with the use of such services. Commercial telecommunications services are commonly based on
network components and consolidated management systems shared by all attached commercial
customers, and may also include third party-provided access lines and other service elements.
Such transmission services may represent sources of increased risk despite contract security
provisions. Related controls: AC-4, AC-17, CA-3, CM-7, CP-8, IR-4, RA-3, SC-5, SC-13.

BOUNDARY PROTECTION | ACCESS POINTS

The organization limits the number of external network connections to the information system.
Supplemental Guidance: Limiting the number of external network connections facilitates more

comprehensive monitoring of inbound and outbound communications traffic. The Trusted
Internet Connection (TIC) initiative is an example of limiting the number of external network
connections.
(4)

BOUNDARY PROTECTION | EXTERNAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES

The organization:
(a)

Implements a managed interface for each external telecommunication service;

(b) Establishes a traffic flow policy for each managed interface;
(c)

Protects the confidentiality and integrity of the information being transmitted across each
interface;

(d) Documents each exception to the traffic flow policy with a supporting mission/business need
and duration of that need; and
(e)

Reviews exceptions to the traffic flow policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]
and removes exceptions that are no longer supported by an explicit mission/business need.

Supplemental Guidance: Related control: SC-8.
(5)

BOUNDARY PROTECTION | DENY BY DEFAULT / ALLOW BY EXCEPTION

The information system at managed interfaces denies network communications traffic by default
and allows network communications traffic by exception (i.e., deny all, permit by exception).
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement applies to both inbound and outbound

network communications traffic. A deny-all, permit-by-exception network communications
traffic policy ensures that only those connections which are essential and approved are
allowed.

BOUNDARY PROTECTION | PREVENT SPLIT TUNNELING FOR REMOTE DEVICES
The information system, in conjunction with a remote device, prevents the device from
simultaneously establishing non-remote connections with the system and communicating via
some other connection to resources in external networks.

Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement is implemented within remote devices (e.g.,

notebook computers) through configuration settings to disable split tunneling in those devices,
and by preventing those configuration settings from being readily configurable by users. This
control enhancement is implemented within the information system by the detection of split
tunneling (or of configuration settings that allow split tunneling) in the remote device, and by
prohibiting the connection if the remote device is using split tunneling. Split tunneling might
be desirable by remote users to communicate with local information system resources such as
printers/file servers. However, split tunneling would in effect allow unauthorized external
connections, making the system more vulnerable to attack and to exfiltration of organizational

information. The use of VPNs for remote connections, when adequately provisioned with
appropriate security controls, may provide the organization with sufficient assurance that it
can effectively treat such connections as non-remote connections from the confidentiality and
integrity perspective. VPNs thus provide a means for allowing non-remote communications
paths from remote devices. The use of an adequately provisioned VPN does not eliminate the
need for preventing split tunneling.
(8)

BOUNDARY PROTECTION | ROUTE TRAFFIC TO AUTHENTICATED PROXY SERVERS

The information system routes [Assignment: organization-defined internal communications traffic]
to [Assignment: organization-defined external networks] through authenticated proxy servers at
managed interfaces.
Supplemental Guidance: External networks are networks outside of organizational control. A

proxy server is a server (i.e., information system or application) that acts as an intermediary
for clients requesting information system resources (e.g., files, connections, web pages, or
services) from other organizational servers. Client requests established through an initial
connection to the proxy server are evaluated to manage complexity and to provide additional
protection by limiting direct connectivity. Web content filtering devices are one of the most
common proxy servers providing access to the Internet. Proxy servers support logging
individual Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) sessions and blocking specific Uniform
Resource Locators (URLs), domain names, and Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Web proxies
can be configured with organization-defined lists of authorized and unauthorized websites.
Related controls: AC-3, AU-2.
(9)

BOUNDARY PROTECTION | RESTRICT THREATENING OUTGOING COMMUNICATIONS TRAFFIC

The information system:
(a)

Detects and denies outgoing communications traffic posing a threat to external information
systems; and

(b) Audits the identity of internal users associated with denied communications.
Supplemental Guidance: Detecting outgoing communications traffic from internal actions that

may pose threats to external information systems is sometimes termed extrusion detection.
Extrusion detection at information system boundaries as part of managed interfaces includes
the analysis of incoming and outgoing communications traffic searching for indications of
internal threats to the security of external systems. Such threats include, for example, traffic
indicative of denial of service attacks and traffic containing malicious code. Related controls:
AU-2, AU-6, SC-38, SC-44, SI-3, SI-4.
(10) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED EXFILTRATION
The organization prevents the unauthorized exfiltration of information across managed interfaces.
Supplemental Guidance: Safeguards implemented by organizations to prevent unauthorized

exfiltration of information from information systems include, for example: (i) strict adherence
to protocol formats; (ii) monitoring for beaconing from information systems; (iii) monitoring
for steganography; (iv) disconnecting external network interfaces except when explicitly
needed; (v) disassembling and reassembling packet headers; and (vi) employing traffic profile
analysis to detect deviations from the volume/types of traffic expected within organizations or
call backs to command and control centers. Devices enforcing strict adherence to protocol
formats include, for example, deep packet inspection firewalls and XML gateways. These
devices verify adherence to protocol formats and specification at the application layer and
serve to identify vulnerabilities that cannot be detected by devices operating at the network or
transport layers. This control enhancement is closely associated with cross-domain solutions
and system guards enforcing information flow requirements. Related control: SI-3.
(11) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | RESTRICT INCOMING COMMUNICATIONS TRAFFIC
The information system only allows incoming communications from [Assignment: organizationdefined authorized sources] to be routed to [Assignment: organization-defined authorized
destinations].
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement provides determinations that source and

destination address pairs represent authorized/allowed communications. Such determinations
can be based on several factors including, for example, the presence of source/destination

APPENDIX F-SC

________________________________________________________________________________________________

address pairs in lists of authorized/allowed communications, the absence of address pairs in
lists of unauthorized/disallowed pairs, or meeting more general rules for authorized/allowed
source/destination pairs. Related control: AC-3.
(12) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | HOST-BASED PROTECTION
The organization implements [Assignment: organization-defined host-based boundary protection
mechanisms] at [Assignment: organization-defined information system components].
Supplemental Guidance: Host-based boundary protection mechanisms include, for example,

host-based firewalls. Information system components employing host-based boundary
protection mechanisms include, for example, servers, workstations, and mobile devices.
(13) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | ISOLATION OF SECURITY TOOLS / MECHANISMS / SUPPORT COMPONENTS
The organization isolates [Assignment: organization-defined information security tools,
mechanisms, and support components] from other internal information system components by
implementing physically separate subnetworks with managed interfaces to other components of
the system.
Supplemental Guidance: Physically separate subnetworks with managed interfaces are useful,

for example, in isolating computer network defenses from critical operational processing
networks to prevent adversaries from discovering the analysis and forensics techniques of
organizations. Related controls: SA-8, SC-2, SC-3.
(14) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | PROTECTS AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED PHYSICAL CONNECTIONS
The organization protects against unauthorized physical connections at [Assignment:
organization-defined managed interfaces].
Supplemental Guidance: Information systems operating at different security categories or

classification levels may share common physical and environmental controls, since the
systems may share space within organizational facilities. In practice, it is possible that these
separate information systems may share common equipment rooms, wiring closets, and cable
distribution paths. Protection against unauthorized physical connections can be achieved, for
example, by employing clearly identified and physically separated cable trays, connection
frames, and patch panels for each side of managed interfaces with physical access controls
enforcing limited authorized access to these items. Related controls: PE-4, PE-19.
(15) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | ROUTE PRIVILEGED NETWORK ACCESSES
The information system routes all networked, privileged accesses through a dedicated, managed
interface for purposes of access control and auditing.
Supplemental Guidance: Related controls: AC-2, AC-3, AU-2, SI-4.
(16) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | PREVENT DISCOVERY OF COMPONENTS / DEVICES
The information system prevents discovery of specific system components composing a managed
interface.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement protects network addresses of information

system components that are part of managed interfaces from discovery through common tools
and techniques used to identify devices on networks. Network addresses are not available for
discovery (e.g., network address not published or entered in domain name systems), requiring
prior knowledge for access. Another obfuscation technique is to periodically change network
addresses.
(17) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | AUTOMATED ENFORCEMENT OF PROTOCOL FORMATS
The information system enforces adherence to protocol formats.
Supplemental Guidance: Information system components that enforce protocol formats include,

for example, deep packet inspection firewalls and XML gateways. Such system components
verify adherence to protocol formats/specifications (e.g., IEEE) at the application layer and
identify significant vulnerabilities that cannot be detected by devices operating at the network
or transport layers. Related control: SC-4.
(18) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | FAIL SECURE
The information system fails securely in the event of an operational failure of a boundary
protection device.

APPENDIX F-SC

PAGE F-191

Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4

Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations

________________________________________________________________________________________________
Supplemental Guidance: Fail secure is a condition achieved by employing information system

mechanisms to ensure that in the event of operational failures of boundary protection devices
at managed interfaces (e.g., routers, firewalls, guards, and application gateways residing on
protected subnetworks commonly referred to as demilitarized zones), information systems do
not enter into unsecure states where intended security properties no longer hold. Failures of
boundary protection devices cannot lead to, or cause information external to the devices to
enter the devices, nor can failures permit unauthorized information releases. Related controls:
CP-2, SC-24.
(19) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | BLOCKS COMMUNICATION FROM NON-ORGANIZATIONALLY CONFIGURED HOSTS
The information system blocks both inbound and outbound communications traffic between
[Assignment: organization-defined communication clients] that are independently configured by
end users and external service providers.
Supplemental Guidance: Communication clients independently configured by end users and

external service providers include, for example, instant messaging clients. Traffic blocking
does not apply to communication clients that are configured by organizations to perform
authorized functions.
(20) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | DYNAMIC ISOLATION / SEGREGATION
The information system provides the capability to dynamically isolate/segregate [Assignment:
organization-defined information system components] from other components of the system.
Supplemental Guidance: The capability to dynamically isolate or segregate certain internal

components of organizational information systems is useful when it is necessary to partition
or separate certain components of dubious origin from those components possessing greater
trustworthiness. Component isolation reduces the attack surface of organizational information
systems. Isolation of selected information system components is also a means of limiting the
damage from successful cyber attacks when those attacks occur.
(21) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | ISOLATION OF INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENTS
The organization employs boundary protection mechanisms to separate [Assignment:
organization-defined information system components] supporting [Assignment: organizationdefined missions and/or business functions].
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations can isolate information system components performing

different missions and/or business functions. Such isolation limits unauthorized information
flows among system components and also provides the opportunity to deploy greater levels of
protection for selected components. Separating system components with boundary protection
mechanisms provides the capability for increased protection of individual components and to
more effectively control information flows between those components. This type of enhanced
protection limits the potential harm from cyber attacks and errors. The degree of separation
provided varies depending upon the mechanisms chosen. Boundary protection mechanisms
include, for example, routers, gateways, and firewalls separating system components into
physically separate networks or subnetworks, cross-domain devices separating subnetworks,
virtualization techniques, and encrypting information flows among system components using
distinct encryption keys. Related controls: CA-9, SC-3.
(22) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | SEPARATE SUBNETS FOR CONNECTING TO DIFFERENT SECURITY DOMAINS
The information system implements separate network addresses (i.e., different subnets) to connect
to systems in different security domains.
Supplemental Guidance: Decomposition of information systems into subnets helps to provide

the appropriate level of protection for network connections to different security domains
containing information with different security categories or classification levels.
(23) BOUNDARY PROTECTION | DISABLE SENDER FEEDBACK ON PROTOCOL VALIDATION FAILURE
The information system disables feedback to senders on protocol format validation failure.
Supplemental Guidance: Disabling feedback to senders when there is a failure in protocol

validation format prevents adversaries from obtaining information which would otherwise be
unavailable.

TRANSMISSION CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY
Control: The information system protects the [Selection (one or more): confidentiality; integrity] of

transmitted information.
Supplemental Guidance: This control applies to both internal and external networks and all types of

information system components from which information can be transmitted (e.g., servers, mobile
devices, notebook computers, printers, copiers, scanners, facsimile machines). Communication
paths outside the physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of
interception and modification. Protecting the confidentiality and/or integrity of organizational
information can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., by employing protected distribution
systems) or by logical means (e.g., employing encryption techniques). Organizations relying on
commercial providers offering transmission services as commodity services rather than as fully
dedicated services (i.e., services which can be highly specialized to individual customer needs),
may find it difficult to obtain the necessary assurances regarding the implementation of needed
security controls for transmission confidentiality/integrity. In such situations, organizations
determine what types of confidentiality/integrity services are available in standard, commercial
telecommunication service packages. If it is infeasible or impractical to obtain the necessary
security controls and assurances of control effectiveness through appropriate contracting vehicles,
organizations implement appropriate compensating security controls or explicitly accept the
additional risk. Related controls: AC-17, PE-4.
Control Enhancements:
(1)

TRANSMISSION CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY | CRYPTOGRAPHIC OR ALTERNATE PHYSICAL PROTECTION

The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to [Selection (one or more):
prevent unauthorized disclosure of information; detect changes to information] during
transmission unless otherwise protected by [Assignment: organization-defined alternative physical
safeguards].
Supplemental Guidance: Encrypting information for transmission protects information from

unauthorized disclosure and modification. Cryptographic mechanisms implemented to protect
information integrity include, for example, cryptographic hash functions which have common
application in digital signatures, checksums, and message authentication codes. Alternative
physical security safeguards include, for example, protected distribution systems. Related
control: SC-13.
(2)

TRANSMISSION CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY | PRE / POST TRANSMISSION HANDLING

The information system maintains the [Selection (one or more): confidentiality; integrity] of
information during preparation for transmission and during reception.
Supplemental Guidance: Information can be either unintentionally or maliciously disclosed or

modified during preparation for transmission or during reception including, for example,
during aggregation, at protocol transformation points, and during packing/unpacking. These
unauthorized disclosures or modifications compromise the confidentiality or integrity of the
information. Related control: AU-10.
(3)

TRANSMISSION CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY | CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION FOR MESSAGE EXTERNALS

The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to protect message externals
unless otherwise protected by [Assignment: organization-defined alternative physical safeguards].
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement addresses protection against unauthorized

disclosure of information. Message externals include, for example, message headers/routing
information. This control enhancement prevents the exploitation of message externals and
applies to both internal and external networks or links that may be visible to individuals who
are not authorized users. Header/routing information is sometimes transmitted unencrypted
because the information is not properly identified by organizations as having significant value

APPENDIX F-SC

or because encrypting the information can result in lower network performance and/or higher
costs. Alternative physical safeguards include, for example, protected distribution systems.
Related controls: SC-12, SC-13.
(4)

TRANSMISSION CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY | CONCEAL / RANDOMIZE COMMUNICATIONS

The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to conceal or randomize
communication patterns unless otherwise protected by [Assignment: organization-defined
alternative physical safeguards].
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement addresses protection against unauthorized

disclosure of information. Communication patterns include, for example, frequency, periods,
amount, and predictability. Changes to communications patterns can reveal information
having intelligence value especially when combined with other available information related
to missions/business functions supported by organizational information systems. This control
enhancement prevents the derivation of intelligence based on communications patterns and
applies to both internal and external networks or links that may be visible to individuals who
are not authorized users. Encrypting the links and transmitting in continuous, fixed/random
patterns prevents the derivation of intelligence from the system communications patterns.
Alternative physical safeguards include, for example, protected distribution systems. Related
controls: SC-12, SC-13.

network connections associated with communications sessions include, for example, de-allocating
associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level, or de-allocating networking
assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single, operating

Supplemental Guidance: Trusted paths are mechanisms by which users (through input devices) can

communicate directly with security functions of information systems with the requisite assurance
to support information security policies. The mechanisms can be activated only by users or the
security functions of organizational information systems. User responses via trusted paths are
protected from modifications by or disclosure to untrusted applications. Organizations employ
trusted paths for high-assurance connections between security functions of information systems
and users (e.g., during system logons). Enforcement of trusted communications paths is typically
provided via an implementation that meets the reference monitor concept. Related controls: AC16, AC-25.

manual procedures or automated mechanisms with supporting manual procedures. Organizations
define key management requirements in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive
Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance, specifying appropriate options,
levels, and parameters. Organizations manage trust stores to ensure that only approved trust

CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION
Control: The information system implements [Assignment: organization-defined cryptographic

uses and type of cryptography required for each use] in accordance with applicable federal laws,
Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards.
Supplemental Guidance: Cryptography can be employed to support a variety of security solutions

including, for example, the protection of classified and Controlled Unclassified Information, the
provision of digital signatures, and the enforcement of information separation when authorized
individuals have the necessary clearances for such information but lack the necessary formal
access approvals. Cryptography can also be used to support random number generation and hash
generation. Generally applicable cryptographic standards include FIPS-validated cryptography and
NSA-approved cryptography. This control does not impose any requirements on organizations to
use cryptography. However, if cryptography is required based on the selection of other security
controls, organizations define each type of cryptographic use and the type of cryptography
required (e.g., protection of classified information: NSA-approved cryptography; provision of

Information systems that provide name and address resolution services include, for example,
domain name system (DNS) servers. Additional artifacts include, for example, DNS Security
(DNSSEC) digital signatures and cryptographic keys. DNS resource records are examples of
authoritative data. The means to indicate the security status of child zones includes, for example,
the use of delegation signer resource records in the DNS. The DNS security controls reflect (and

________________________________________________________________________________________________
Supplemental Guidance: Information systems that provide name and address resolution services

include, for example, domain name system (DNS) servers. To eliminate single points of failure
and to enhance redundancy, organizations employ at least two authoritative domain name system
servers, one configured as the primary server and the other configured as the secondary server.
Additionally, organizations typically deploy the servers in two geographically separated network
subnetworks (i.e., not located in the same physical facility). For role separation, DNS servers with
internal roles only process name and address resolution requests from within organizations (i.e.,
from internal clients). DNS servers with external roles only process name and address resolution
information requests from clients external to organizations (i.e., on external networks including
the Internet). Organizations specify clients that can access authoritative DNS servers in particular
roles (e.g., by address ranges, explicit lists). Related controls: SC-2, SC-20, SC-21, SC-24.

of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information in the event of failures of organizational
information systems or system components. Failure in a known safe state helps to prevent systems

rest and covers user information and system information. Information at rest refers to the state of
information when it is located on storage devices as specific components of information systems.
System-related information requiring protection includes, for example, configurations or rule sets
for firewalls, gateways, intrusion detection/prevention systems, filtering routers, and authenticator
content. Organizations may employ different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity
protections, including the use of cryptographic mechanisms and file share scanning. Integrity
protection can be achieved, for example, by implementing Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM)
technologies. Organizations may also employ other security controls including, for example,
secure off-line storage in lieu of online storage when adequate protection of information at rest
cannot otherwise be achieved and/or continuous monitoring to identify malicious code at rest.

________________________________________________________________________________________________
Supplemental Guidance: Selection of cryptographic mechanisms is based on the need to protect

the confidentiality and integrity of organizational information. The strength of mechanism is
commensurate with the security category and/or classification of the information. This control
enhancement applies to significant concentrations of digital media in organizational areas
designated for media storage and also to limited quantities of media generally associated with
information system components in operational environments (e.g., portable storage devices,
mobile devices). Organizations have the flexibility to either encrypt all information on storage
devices (i.e., full disk encryption) or encrypt specific data structures (e.g., files, records, or
fields). Organizations employing cryptographic mechanisms to protect information at rest also
consider cryptographic key management solutions. Related controls: AC-19, SC-12.

PROTECTION OF INFORMATION AT REST | OFF-LINE STORAGE

The organization removes from online storage and stores off-line in a secure location [Assignment:

storage to off-line storage eliminates the possibility of individuals gaining unauthorized
access to the information through a network. Therefore, organizations may choose to move
information to off-line storage in lieu of protecting such information in online storage.

HETEROGENEITY
Control: The organization employs a diverse set of information technologies for [Assignment:
organization-defined information system components] in the implementation of the information
system.
Supplemental Guidance: Increasing the diversity of information technologies within organizational

information systems reduces the impact of potential exploitations of specific technologies and also
defends against common mode failures, including those failures induced by supply chain attacks.
Diversity in information technologies also reduces the likelihood that the means adversaries use to
compromise one information system component will be equally effective against other system
components, thus further increasing the adversary work factor to successfully complete planned
cyber attacks. An increase in diversity may add complexity and management overhead which
could ultimately lead to mistakes and unauthorized configurations. Related controls: SA-12, SA14, SC-27.
Control Enhancements:

HETEROGENEITY | VIRTUALIZATION TECHNIQUES

The organization employs virtualization techniques to support the deployment of a diversity of
operating systems and applications that are changed [Assignment: organization-defined
frequency].
Supplemental Guidance: While frequent changes to operating systems and applications pose

configuration management challenges, the changes can result in an increased work factor for
adversaries in order to carry out successful cyber attacks. Changing virtual operating systems
or applications, as opposed to changing actual operating systems/applications, provide virtual
changes that impede attacker success while reducing configuration management efforts. In
addition, virtualization techniques can assist organizations in isolating untrustworthy software
and/or software of dubious provenance into confined execution environments.

CONCEALMENT AND MISDIRECTION
Control: The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined concealment and

misdirection techniques] for [Assignment: organization-defined information systems] at
[Assignment: organization-defined time periods] to confuse and mislead adversaries.
Supplemental Guidance: Concealment and misdirection techniques can significantly reduce the

targeting capability of adversaries (i.e., window of opportunity and available attack surface) to
initiate and complete cyber attacks. For example, virtualization techniques provide organizations
with the ability to disguise information systems, potentially reducing the likelihood of successful
attacks without the cost of having multiple platforms. Increased use of concealment/misdirection
techniques including, for example, randomness, uncertainty, and virtualization, may sufficiently
confuse and mislead adversaries and subsequently increase the risk of discovery and/or exposing
tradecraft. Concealment/misdirection techniques may also provide organizations additional time to
successfully perform core missions and business functions. Because of the time and effort required
to support concealment/misdirection techniques, it is anticipated that such techniques would be
used by organizations on a very limited basis. Related controls: SC-26, SC-29, SI-14.

[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SC-29 (1)].

CONCEALMENT AND MISDIRECTION | RANDOMNESS

The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined techniques] to introduce
randomness into organizational operations and assets.
Supplemental Guidance: Randomness introduces increased levels of uncertainty for adversaries

regarding the actions organizations take in defending against cyber attacks. Such actions may
impede the ability of adversaries to correctly target information resources of organizations
supporting critical missions/business functions. Uncertainty may also cause adversaries to
hesitate before initiating or continuing attacks. Misdirection techniques involving randomness
include, for example, performing certain routine actions at different times of day, employing
different information technologies (e.g., browsers, search engines), using different suppliers,
and rotating roles and responsibilities of organizational personnel.
(3)

CONCEALMENT AND MISDIRECTION | CHANGE PROCESSING / STORAGE LOCATIONS

The organization changes the location of [Assignment: organization-defined processing and/or
storage] [Selection: [Assignment: organization-defined time frequency]; at random time intervals]].
Supplemental Guidance: Adversaries target critical organizational missions/business functions

and the information resources supporting those missions and functions while at the same time,
trying to minimize exposure of their existence and tradecraft. The static, homogeneous, and
deterministic nature of organizational information systems targeted by adversaries, make such
systems more susceptible to cyber attacks with less adversary cost and effort to be successful.
Changing organizational processing and storage locations (sometimes referred to as moving
target defense) addresses the advanced persistent threat (APT) using techniques such as
virtualization, distributed processing, and replication. This enables organizations to relocate
the information resources (i.e., processing and/or storage) supporting critical missions and
business functions. Changing locations of processing activities and/or storage sites introduces
uncertainty into the targeting activities by adversaries. This uncertainty increases the work
factor of adversaries making compromises or breaches to organizational information systems
much more difficult and time-consuming, and increases the chances that adversaries may
inadvertently disclose aspects of tradecraft while attempting to locate critical organizational
resources.

CONCEALMENT AND MISDIRECTION | MISLEADING INFORMATION

The organization employs realistic, but misleading information in [Assignment: organizationdefined information system components] with regard to its security state or posture.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement misleads potential adversaries regarding the

nature and extent of security safeguards deployed by organizations. As a result, adversaries
may employ incorrect (and as a result ineffective) attack techniques. One way of misleading
adversaries is for organizations to place misleading information regarding the specific security
controls deployed in external information systems that are known to be accessed or targeted
by adversaries. Another technique is the use of deception nets (e.g., honeynets, virtualized
environments) that mimic actual aspects of organizational information systems but use, for
example, out-of-date software configurations.

CONCEALMENT AND MISDIRECTION | CONCEALMENT OF SYSTEM COMPONENTS
The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined techniques] to hide or conceal

target and successfully compromise those assets. Potential means for organizations to hide
and/or conceal information system components include, for example, configuration of routers
or the use of honeynets or virtualization techniques.

Supplemental Guidance: Developers are in the best position to identify potential areas within

systems that might lead to covert channels. Covert channel analysis is a meaningful activity when
there is the potential for unauthorized information flows across security domains, for example, in
the case of information systems containing export-controlled information and having connections

DISTRIBUTED PROCESSING AND STORAGE
Control: The organization distributes [Assignment: organization-defined processing and storage]

across multiple physical locations.
Supplemental Guidance: Distributing processing and storage across multiple physical locations

provides some degree of redundancy or overlap for organizations, and therefore increases the work
factor of adversaries to adversely impact organizational operations, assets, and individuals. This
control does not assume a single primary processing or storage location, and thus allows for
parallel processing and storage. Related controls: CP-6, CP-7.

DISTRIBUTED PROCESSING AND STORAGE | POLLING TECHNIQUES

The organization employs polling techniques to identify potential faults, errors, or compromises to
[Assignment: organization-defined distributed processing and storage components].
Supplemental Guidance: Distributed processing and/or storage may be employed to reduce

opportunities for adversaries to successfully compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or
availability of information and information systems. However, distribution of processing
and/or storage components does not prevent adversaries from compromising one (or more) of
the distributed components. Polling compares the processing results and/or storage content
from the various distributed components and subsequently voting on the outcomes. Polling
identifies potential faults, errors, or compromises in distributed processing and/or storage
components. Related control: SI-4.

OUT-OF-BAND CHANNELS
Control: The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined out-of-band channels] for

the physical delivery or electronic transmission of [Assignment: organization-defined information,
information system components, or devices] to [Assignment: organization-defined individuals or
information systems].
Supplemental Guidance: Out-of-band channels include, for example, local (nonnetwork) accesses to

information systems, network paths physically separate from network paths used for operational
traffic, or nonelectronic paths such as the US Postal Service. This is in contrast with using the
same channels (i.e., in-band channels) that carry routine operational traffic. Out-of-band channels
do not have the same vulnerability/exposure as in-band channels, and hence the confidentiality,
integrity, or availability compromises of in-band channels will not compromise the out-of-band
channels. Organizations may employ out-of-band channels in the delivery or transmission of many
organizational items including, for example, identifiers/authenticators, configuration management
changes for hardware, firmware, or software, cryptographic key management information, security
updates, system/data backups, maintenance information, and malicious code protection updates.

OPERATIONS SECURITY
Control: The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined operations security

safeguards] to protect key organizational information throughout the system development life
cycle.
Supplemental Guidance: Operations security (OPSEC) is a systematic process by which potential

adversaries can be denied information about the capabilities and intentions of organizations by
identifying, controlling, and protecting generally unclassified information that specifically relates
to the planning and execution of sensitive organizational activities. The OPSEC process involves
five steps: (i) identification of critical information (e.g., the security categorization process); (ii)
analysis of threats; (iii) analysis of vulnerabilities; (iv) assessment of risks; and (v) the application
of appropriate countermeasures. OPSEC safeguards are applied to both organizational information
systems and the environments in which those systems operate. OPSEC safeguards help to protect
the confidentiality of key information including, for example, limiting the sharing of information
with suppliers and potential suppliers of information system components, information technology
products and services, and with other non-organizational elements and individuals. Information
critical to mission/business success includes, for example, user identities, element uses, suppliers,
supply chain processes, functional and security requirements, system design specifications, testing
protocols, and security control implementation details. Related controls: RA-2, RA-5, SA-12.

PROCESS ISOLATION | HARDWARE SEPARATION

The information system implements underlying hardware separation mechanisms to facilitate
process separation.
Supplemental Guidance: Hardware-based separation of information system processes is

generally less susceptible to compromise than software-based separation, thus providing
greater assurance that the separation will be enforced. Underlying hardware separation
mechanisms include, for example, hardware memory management.

WIRELESS LINK PROTECTION
Control: The information system protects external and internal [Assignment: organization-defined

wireless links] from [Assignment: organization-defined types of signal parameter attacks or
references to sources for such attacks].
Supplemental Guidance: This control applies to internal and external wireless communication links

that may be visible to individuals who are not authorized information system users. Adversaries
can exploit the signal parameters of wireless links if such links are not adequately protected. There
are many ways to exploit the signal parameters of wireless links to gain intelligence, deny service,
or to spoof users of organizational information systems. This control reduces the impact of attacks
that are unique to wireless systems. If organizations rely on commercial service providers for
transmission services as commodity items rather than as fully dedicated services, it may not be
possible to implement this control. Related controls: AC-18, SC-5.
Control Enhancements:

WIRELESS LINK PROTECTION | ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERFERENCE

The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms that achieve [Assignment:
organization-defined level of protection] against the effects of intentional electromagnetic
interference.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement protects against intentional jamming that

might deny or impair communications by ensuring that wireless spread spectrum waveforms
used to provide anti-jam protection are not predictable by unauthorized individuals. The
control enhancement may also coincidentally help to mitigate the effects of unintentional
jamming due to interference from legitimate transmitters sharing the same spectrum. Mission
requirements, projected threats, concept of operations, and applicable legislation, directives,
regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines determine levels of wireless link availability
and performance/cryptography needed. Related controls: SC-12, SC-13.
(2)

WIRELESS LINK PROTECTION | REDUCE DETECTION POTENTIAL

The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to reduce the detection potential
of wireless links to [Assignment: organization-defined level of reduction].
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement is needed for covert communications and

protecting wireless transmitters from being geo-located by their transmissions. The control
enhancement ensures that spread spectrum waveforms used to achieve low probability of

(3)

WIRELESS LINK PROTECTION | IMITATIVE OR MANIPULATIVE COMMUNICATIONS DECEPTION

The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to identify and reject wireless
transmissions that are deliberate attempts to achieve imitative or manipulative communications
deception based on signal parameters.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement ensures that the signal parameters of

wireless transmissions are not predictable by unauthorized individuals. Such unpredictability
reduces the probability of imitative or manipulative communications deception based upon
signal parameters alone. Related controls: SC-12, SC-13.
(4)

WIRELESS LINK PROTECTION | SIGNAL PARAMETER IDENTIFICATION

The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to prevent the identification of
[Assignment: organization-defined wireless transmitters] by using the transmitter signal
parameters.
Supplemental Guidance: Radio fingerprinting techniques identify the unique signal parameters

of transmitters to fingerprint such transmitters for purposes of tracking and mission/user
identification. This control enhancement protects against the unique identification of wireless
transmitters for purposes of intelligence exploitation by ensuring that anti-fingerprinting
alterations to signal parameters are not predictable by unauthorized individuals. This control

Prohibits the remote activation of environmental sensing capabilities with the following
exceptions: [Assignment: organization-defined exceptions where remote activation of sensors
is allowed]; and

b.

Provides an explicit indication of sensor use to [Assignment: organization-defined class of
users].

Supplemental Guidance: This control often applies to types of information systems or system

components characterized as mobile devices, for example, smart phones, tablets, and E-readers.
These systems often include sensors that can collect and record data regarding the environment
where the system is in use. Sensors that are embedded within mobile devices include, for example,
cameras, microphones, Global Positioning System (GPS) mechanisms, and accelerometers. While
the sensors on mobiles devices provide an important function, if activated covertly, such devices
can potentially provide a means for adversaries to learn valuable information about individuals
and organizations. For example, remotely activating the GPS function on a mobile device could
provide an adversary with the ability to track the specific movements of an individual.
Control Enhancements:

SENSOR CAPABILITY AND DATA | REPORTING TO AUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS OR ROLES
The organization ensures that the information system is configured so that data or information
collected by the [Assignment: organization-defined sensors] is only reported to authorized
individuals or roles.

Supplemental Guidance: In situations where sensors are activated by authorized individuals

(e.g., end users), it is still possible that the data/information collected by the sensors will be
sent to unauthorized entities.
(2)

SENSOR CAPABILITY AND DATA | AUTHORIZED USE

The organization employs the following measures: [Assignment: organization-defined measures],
so that data or information collected by [Assignment: organization-defined sensors] is only used
for authorized purposes.
Supplemental Guidance: Information collected by sensors for a specific authorized purpose

potentially could be misused for some unauthorized purpose. For example, GPS sensors that
are used to support traffic navigation could be misused to track movements of
individuals. Measures to mitigate such activities include, for example, additional training to
ensure that authorized parties do not abuse their authority, or (in the case where sensor
data/information is maintained by external parties) contractual restrictions on the use of the
data/information.

allow organizations to open email attachments, execute untrusted or suspicious applications, and
execute Universal Resource Locator (URL) requests in the safety of an isolated environment or
virtualized sandbox. These protected and isolated execution environments provide a means of
determining whether the associated attachments/applications contain malicious code. While
related to the concept of deception nets, the control is not intended to maintain a long-term
environment in which adversaries can operate and their actions can be observed. Rather, it is
intended to quickly identify malicious code and reduce the likelihood that the code is propagated
to user environments of operation (or prevent such propagation completely). Related controls: SC7, SC-25, SC-26, SC-30.

continuous monitoring, incident response activities, and system error handling. Organizations take
advantage of available resources such as the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) or Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) databases in remediating flaws discovered in organizational
information systems. By incorporating flaw remediation into ongoing configuration management
processes, required/anticipated remediation actions can be tracked and verified. Flaw remediation
actions that can be tracked and verified include, for example, determining whether organizations
follow US-CERT guidance and Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts. Organization-defined
time periods for updating security-relevant software and firmware may vary based on a variety of
factors including, for example, the security category of the information system or the criticality of
the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw). Some types of flaw
remediation may require more testing than other types. Organizations determine the degree and
type of testing needed for the specific type of flaw remediation activity under consideration and
also the types of changes that are to be configuration-managed. In some situations, organizations
may determine that the testing of software and/or firmware updates is not necessary or practical,
for example, when implementing simple anti-virus signature updates. Organizations may also
consider in testing decisions, whether security-relevant software or firmware updates are obtained
from authorized sources with appropriate digital signatures. Related controls: CA-2, CA-7, CM-3,

MALICIOUS CODE PROTECTION
Control: The organization:

Employs malicious code protection mechanisms at information system entry and exit points to
detect and eradicate malicious code;

b.

Updates malicious code protection mechanisms whenever new releases are available in
accordance with organizational configuration management policy and procedures;

c.

Configures malicious code protection mechanisms to:

d.

1.

Perform periodic scans of the information system [Assignment: organization-defined

administrator; [Assignment: organization-defined action]] in response to malicious code
detection; and

Addresses the receipt of false positives during malicious code detection and eradication and
the resulting potential impact on the availability of the information system.

Supplemental Guidance: Information system entry and exit points include, for example, firewalls,

electronic mail servers, web servers, proxy servers, remote-access servers, workstations, notebook
computers, and mobile devices. Malicious code includes, for example, viruses, worms, Trojan
horses, and spyware. Malicious code can also be encoded in various formats (e.g., UUENCODE,
Unicode), contained within compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using steganography.
Malicious code can be transported by different means including, for example, web accesses,
electronic mail, electronic mail attachments, and portable storage devices. Malicious code
insertions occur through the exploitation of information system vulnerabilities. Malicious code
protection mechanisms include, for example, anti-virus signature definitions and reputation-based
technologies. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or eliminate the effects of
malicious code. Pervasive configuration management and comprehensive software integrity
controls may be effective in preventing execution of unauthorized code. In addition to commercial
off-the-shelf software, malicious code may also be present in custom-built software. This could
include, for example, logic bombs, back doors, and other types of cyber attacks that could affect
organizational missions/business functions. Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms
cannot always detect such code. In these situations, organizations rely instead on other safeguards
including, for example, secure coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted
procurement processes, and monitoring practices to help ensure that software does not perform
functions other than the functions intended. Organizations may determine that in response to the
detection of malicious code, different actions may be warranted. For example, organizations can
define actions in response to malicious code detection during periodic scans, actions in response to
detection of malicious downloads, and/or actions in response to detection of maliciousness when
attempting to open or execute files. Related controls: CM-3, MP-2, SA-4, SA-8, SA-12, SA-13,

MALICIOUS CODE PROTECTION | NONSIGNATURE-BASED DETECTION

The information system implements nonsignature-based malicious code detection mechanisms.
Supplemental Guidance: Nonsignature-based detection mechanisms include, for example, the

use of heuristics to detect, analyze, and describe the characteristics or behavior of malicious
code and to provide safeguards against malicious code for which signatures do not yet exist or
for which existing signatures may not be effective. This includes polymorphic malicious code
(i.e., code that changes signatures when it replicates). This control enhancement does not

Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement can also be applied to critical interfaces

other than kernel-based interfaces, including for example, interfaces with virtual machines
and privileged applications. Unauthorized operating system commands include, for example,
commands for kernel functions from information system processes that are not trusted to
initiate such commands, or commands for kernel functions that are suspicious even though
commands of that type are reasonable for processes to initiate. Organizations can define the
malicious commands to be detected by a combination of command types, command classes,
or specific instances of commands. Organizations can define hardware components by
specific component, component type, location in the network, or combination therein.

(i.e., tactics, techniques, and procedures) and the functionality and purpose of specific
instances of malicious code. Understanding the characteristics of malicious code facilitates
more effective organizational responses to current and future threats. Organizations can

Supplemental Guidance: Information system monitoring includes external and internal monitoring.

External monitoring includes the observation of events occurring at the information system
boundary (i.e., part of perimeter defense and boundary protection). Internal monitoring includes
the observation of events occurring within the information system. Organizations can monitor
information systems, for example, by observing audit activities in real time or by observing other
system aspects such as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring
objectives may guide determination of the events. Information system monitoring capability is
achieved through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., intrusion detection systems, intrusion
prevention systems, malicious code protection software, scanning tools, audit record monitoring
software, network monitoring software). Strategic locations for monitoring devices include, for
example, selected perimeter locations and near server farms supporting critical applications, with
such devices typically being employed at the managed interfaces associated with controls SC-7
and AC-17. Einstein network monitoring devices from the Department of Homeland Security can
also be included as monitoring devices. The granularity of monitoring information collected is
based on organizational monitoring objectives and the capability of information systems to
support such objectives. Specific types of transactions of interest include, for example, Hyper Text
Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that bypasses HTTP proxies. Information system monitoring is
an integral part of organizational continuous monitoring and incident response programs. Output
from system monitoring serves as input to continuous monitoring and incident response programs.
A network connection is any connection with a device that communicates through a network (e.g.,
local area network, Internet). A remote connection is any connection with a device communicating
through an external network (e.g., the Internet). Local, network, and remote connections can be
either wired or wireless. Related controls: AC-3, AC-4, AC-8, AC-17, AU-2, AU-6, AU-7, AU-9,

(identified by name and/or by role)] of detected suspicious events and takes [Assignment:
organization-defined least-disruptive actions to terminate suspicious events].
Supplemental Guidance: Least-disruptive actions may include, for example, initiating requests

for human responses.
(8)

INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | PROTECTION OF MONITORING INFORMATION

[Withdrawn: Incorporated into SI-4].
(9)

INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | TESTING OF MONITORING TOOLS
The organization tests intrusion-monitoring tools [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].

Supplemental Guidance: Testing intrusion-monitoring tools is necessary to ensure that the tools

are operating correctly and continue to meet the monitoring objectives of organizations. The
frequency of testing depends on the types of tools used by organizations and methods of
deployment. Related control: CP-9.
(10) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | VISIBILITY OF ENCRYPTED COMMUNICATIONS
The organization makes provisions so that [Assignment: organization-defined encrypted
communications traffic] is visible to [Assignment: organization-defined information system
monitoring tools].
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations balance the potentially conflicting needs for encrypting

communications traffic and for having insight into such traffic from a monitoring perspective.
For some organizations, the need to ensure the confidentiality of communications traffic is
paramount; for others, mission-assurance is of greater concern. Organizations determine
whether the visibility requirement applies to internal encrypted traffic, encrypted traffic
intended for external destinations, or a subset of the traffic types.
(11) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | ANALYZE COMMUNICATIONS TRAFFIC ANOMALIES
The organization analyzes outbound communications traffic at the external boundary of the
information system and selected [Assignment: organization-defined interior points within the
system (e.g., subnetworks, subsystems)] to discover anomalies.
Supplemental Guidance: Anomalies within organizational information systems include, for

example, large file transfers, long-time persistent connections, unusual protocols and ports in
use, and attempted communications with suspected malicious external addresses.
(12) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | AUTOMATED ALERTS
The organization employs automated mechanisms to alert security personnel of the following
inappropriate or unusual activities with security implications: [Assignment: organization-defined
activities that trigger alerts].
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement focuses on the security alerts generated by

organizations and transmitted using automated means. In contrast to the alerts generated by

APPENDIX F-SI

________________________________________________________________________________________________

information systems in SI-4 (5), which tend to focus on information sources internal to the
systems (e.g., audit records), the sources of information for this enhancement can include
other entities as well (e.g., suspicious activity reports, reports on potential insider threats).
Related controls: AC-18, IA-3.
(13) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | ANALYZE TRAFFIC / EVENT PATTERNS
The organization:
(a)

Analyzes communications traffic/event patterns for the information system;

(b) Develops profiles representing common traffic patterns and/or events; and
(c)

Uses the traffic/event profiles in tuning system-monitoring devices to reduce the number of
false positives and the number of false negatives.

(14) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | WIRELESS INTRUSION DETECTION
The organization employs a wireless intrusion detection system to identify rogue wireless devices
and to detect attack attempts and potential compromises/breaches to the information system.
Supplemental Guidance: Wireless signals may radiate beyond the confines of organization-

controlled facilities. Organizations proactively search for unauthorized wireless connections
including the conduct of thorough scans for unauthorized wireless access points. Scans are not
limited to those areas within facilities containing information systems, but also include areas
outside of facilities as needed, to verify that unauthorized wireless access points are not
connected to the systems. Related controls: AC-18, IA-3.
(15) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | WIRELESS TO WIRELINE COMMUNICATIONS
The organization employs an intrusion detection system to monitor wireless communications
traffic as the traffic passes from wireless to wireline networks.
Supplemental Guidance: Related control: AC-18.
(16) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | CORRELATE MONITORING INFORMATION
The organization correlates information from monitoring tools employed throughout the
information system.
Supplemental Guidance: Correlating information from different monitoring tools can provide a

more comprehensive view of information system activity. The correlation of monitoring tools
that usually work in isolation (e.g., host monitoring, network monitoring, anti-virus software)
can provide an organization-wide view and in so doing, may reveal otherwise unseen attack
patterns. Understanding the capabilities/limitations of diverse monitoring tools and how to
maximize the utility of information generated by those tools can help organizations to build,
operate, and maintain effective monitoring programs. Related control: AU-6.
(17) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | INTEGRATED SITUATIONAL AWARENESS
The organization correlates information from monitoring physical, cyber, and supply chain
activities to achieve integrated, organization-wide situational awareness.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement correlates monitoring information from a

more diverse set of information sources to achieve integrated situational awareness. Integrated
situational awareness from a combination of physical, cyber, and supply chain monitoring
activities enhances the capability of organizations to more quickly detect sophisticated cyber
attacks and investigate the methods and techniques employed to carry out such attacks. In
contrast to SI-4 (16) which correlates the various cyber monitoring information, this control
enhancement correlates monitoring beyond just the cyber domain. Such monitoring may help
reveal attacks on organizations that are operating across multiple attack vectors. Related
control: SA-12.
(18) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | ANALYZE TRAFFIC / COVERT EXFILTRATION
The organization analyzes outbound communications traffic at the external boundary of the
information system (i.e., system perimeter) and at [Assignment: organization-defined interior
points within the system (e.g., subsystems, subnetworks)] to detect covert exfiltration of
information.
Supplemental Guidance: Covert means that can be used for the unauthorized exfiltration of

organizational information include, for example, steganography.

individuals who have been identified by [Assignment: organization-defined sources] as posing an
increased level of risk.
Supplemental Guidance: Indications of increased risk from individuals can be obtained from a

variety of sources including, for example, human resource records, intelligence agencies, law
enforcement organizations, and/or other credible sources. The monitoring of individuals is
closely coordinated with management, legal, security, and human resources officials within
organizations conducting such monitoring and complies with federal legislation, Executive
Orders, policies, directives, regulations, and standards.
(20) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | PRIVILEGED USERS
The organization implements [Assignment: organization-defined additional monitoring] of
privileged users.
(21) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | PROBATIONARY PERIODS

individuals during [Assignment: organization-defined probationary period].
(22) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | UNAUTHORIZED NETWORK SERVICES
The information system detects network services that have not been authorized or approved by
[Assignment: organization-defined authorization or approval processes] and [Selection (one or
more): audits; alerts [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]].
Supplemental Guidance: Unauthorized or unapproved network services include, for example,

services in service-oriented architectures that lack organizational verification or validation
and therefore may be unreliable or serve as malicious rogues for valid services. Related
controls: AC-6, CM-7, SA-5, SA-9.
(23) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | HOST-BASED DEVICES
The organization implements [Assignment: organization-defined host-based monitoring
mechanisms] at [Assignment: organization-defined information system components].
Supplemental Guidance: Information system components where host-based monitoring can be

implemented include, for example, servers, workstations, and mobile devices. Organizations
consider employing host-based monitoring mechanisms from multiple information technology
product developers.
(24) INFORMATION SYSTEM MONITORING | INDICATORS OF COMPROMISE
The information system discovers, collects, distributes, and uses indicators of compromise.
Supplemental Guidance: Indicators of compromise (IOC) are forensic artifacts from intrusions

that are identified on organizational information systems (at the host or network level). IOCs
provide organizations with valuable information on objects or information systems that have
been compromised. IOCs for the discovery of compromised hosts can include for example,
the creation of registry key values. IOCs for network traffic include, for example, Universal
Resource Locator (URL) or protocol elements that indicate malware command and control
servers. The rapid distribution and adoption of IOCs can improve information security by
reducing the time that information systems and organizations are vulnerable to the same
exploit or attack.

Supplemental Guidance: Organizations may define different integrity checking and anomaly

responses: (i) by type of information (e.g., firmware, software, user data); (ii) by specific
information (e.g., boot firmware, boot firmware for a specific types of machines); or (iii) a
combination of both. Automatic implementation of specific safeguards within organizational
information systems includes, for example, reversing the changes, halting the information
system, or triggering audit alerts when unauthorized modifications to critical security files
occur.
(6)

SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTECTION

The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to detect unauthorized changes to
software, firmware, and information.
Supplemental Guidance: Cryptographic mechanisms used for the protection of integrity include,

for example, digital signatures and the computation and application of signed hashes using
asymmetric cryptography, protecting the confidentiality of the key used to generate the hash,
and using the public key to verify the hash information. Related control: SC-13.

SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | INTEGRATION OF DETECTION AND RESPONSE

The organization incorporates the detection of unauthorized [Assignment: organization-defined
security-relevant changes to the information system] into the organizational incident response
capability.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement helps to ensure that detected events are

tracked, monitored, corrected, and available for historical purposes. Maintaining historical
records is important both for being able to identify and discern adversary actions over an
extended period of time and for possible legal actions. Security-relevant changes include, for
example, unauthorized changes to established configuration settings or unauthorized elevation
of information system privileges. Related controls: IR-4, IR-5, SI-4.

________________________________________________________________________________________________
Supplemental Guidance: Unauthorized modifications to boot firmware may be indicative of a

sophisticated, targeted cyber attack. These types of cyber attacks can result in a permanent
denial of service (e.g., if the firmware is corrupted) or a persistent malicious code presence
(e.g., if code is embedded within the firmware). Devices can protect the integrity of the boot
firmware in organizational information systems by: (i) verifying the integrity and authenticity
of all updates to the boot firmware prior to applying changes to the boot devices; and (ii)
preventing unauthorized processes from modifying the boot firmware.
(11) SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | CONFINED ENVIRONMENTS WITH LIMITED PRIVILEGES
The organization requires that [Assignment: organization-defined user-installed software] execute
in a confined physical or virtual machine environment with limited privileges.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations identify software that may be of greater concern with

regard to origin or potential for containing malicious code. For this type of software, user
installations occur in confined environments of operation to limit or contain damage from
malicious code that may be executed.
(12) SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | INTEGRITY VERIFICATION
The organization requires that the integrity of [Assignment: organization-defined user-installed
software] be verified prior to execution.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations verify the integrity of user-installed software prior to

execution to reduce the likelihood of executing malicious code or code that contains errors
from unauthorized modifications. Organizations consider the practicality of approaches to
verifying software integrity including, for example, availability of checksums of adequate
trustworthiness from software developers or vendors.
(13) SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | CODE EXECUTION IN PROTECTED ENVIRONMENTS
The organization allows execution of binary or machine-executable code obtained from sources
with limited or no warranty and without the provision of source code only in confined physical or
virtual machine environments and with the explicit approval of [Assignment: organization-defined
personnel or roles].
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement applies to all sources of binary or machine-

executable code including, for example, commercial software/firmware and open source
software.

requirements and with the approval of the authorizing official.
Supplemental Guidance: This control enhancement applies to all sources of binary or machine-

executable code including, for example, commercial software/firmware and open source
software. Organizations assess software products without accompanying source code from
sources with limited or no warranty for potential security impacts. The assessments address
the fact that these types of software products may be very difficult to review, repair, or
extend, given that organizations, in most cases, do not have access to the original source code,
and there may be no owners who could make such repairs on behalf of organizations. Related
control: SA-5.
(15) SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY | CODE AUTHENTICATION
The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to authenticate [Assignment:
organization-defined software or firmware components] prior to installation.

INFORMATION INPUT RESTRICTIONS
[Withdrawn: Incorporated into AC-2, AC-3, AC-5, AC-6].

SI-10

INFORMATION INPUT VALIDATION
Control: The information system checks the validity of [Assignment: organization-defined

information inputs].
Supplemental Guidance: Checking the valid syntax and semantics of information system inputs

(e.g., character set, length, numerical range, and acceptable values) verifies that inputs match
specified definitions for format and content. Software applications typically follow well-defined
protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between
software modules or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured
data interspersed with metadata or control information. If software applications use attackersupplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages, then
the attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause the data to be
interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component that
receives the tainted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the
data incorrectly. Prescreening inputs prior to passing to interpreters prevents the content from
being unintentionally interpreted as commands. Input validation helps to ensure accurate and
correct inputs and prevent attacks such as cross-site scripting and a variety of injection attacks.
Control Enhancements:
(1)

INFORMATION INPUT VALIDATION | MANUAL OVERRIDE CAPABILITY

The information system:
(a)

Provides a manual override capability for input validation of [Assignment: organizationdefined inputs];

(b) Restricts the use of the manual override capability to only [Assignment: organization-defined
authorized individuals]; and
(c)

Supplemental Guidance: Related controls: CM-3, CM-5.
(2)

INFORMATION INPUT VALIDATION | REVIEW / RESOLUTION OF ERRORS

The organization ensures that input validation errors are reviewed and resolved within
[Assignment: organization-defined time period].
Supplemental Guidance: Resolution of input validation errors includes, for example, correcting

systemic causes of errors and resubmitting transactions with corrected input.
(3)

INFORMATION INPUT VALIDATION | PREDICTABLE BEHAVIOR

The information system behaves in a predictable and documented manner that reflects
organizational and system objectives when invalid inputs are received.
Supplemental Guidance: A common vulnerability in organizational information systems is

unpredictable behavior when invalid inputs are received. This control enhancement ensures
that there is predictable behavior in the face of invalid inputs by specifying information
system responses that facilitate transitioning the system to known states without adverse,
unintended side effects.
(4)

INFORMATION INPUT VALIDATION | REVIEW / TIMING INTERACTIONS

The organization accounts for timing interactions among information system components in
determining appropriate responses for invalid inputs.
Supplemental Guidance: In addressing invalid information system inputs received across

protocol interfaces, timing interactions become relevant, where one protocol needs to consider
the impact of the error response on other protocols within the protocol stack. For example,
802.11 standard wireless network protocols do not interact well with Transmission Control
Protocols (TCP) when packets are dropped (which could be due to invalid packet input). TCP
assumes packet losses are due to congestion, while packets lost over 802.11 links are typically
dropped due to collisions or noise on the link. If TCP makes a congestion response, it takes

APPENDIX F-SI

precisely the wrong action in response to a collision event. Adversaries may be able to use
apparently acceptable individual behaviors of the protocols in concert to achieve adverse

b.

Reveals error messages only to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].

Supplemental Guidance: Organizations carefully consider the structure/content of error messages.

The extent to which information systems are able to identify and handle error conditions is guided
by organizational policy and operational requirements. Information that could be exploited by
adversaries includes, for example, erroneous logon attempts with passwords entered by mistake as
the username, mission/business information that can be derived from (if not stated explicitly by)
information recorded, and personal information such as account numbers, social security numbers,
and credit card numbers. In addition, error messages may provide a covert channel for transmitting

Determines mean time to failure (MTTF) for [Assignment: organization-defined information
system components] in specific environments of operation; and

b.

Provides substitute information system components and a means to exchange active and
standby components at [Assignment: organization-defined MTTF substitution criteria].

Supplemental Guidance: While MTTF is primarily a reliability issue, this control addresses potential

failures of specific information system components that provide security capability. Failure rates
reflect installation-specific consideration, not industry-average. Organizations define criteria for
substitution of information system components based on MTTF value with consideration for
resulting potential harm from component failures. Transfer of responsibilities between active and
standby components does not compromise safety, operational readiness, or security capability
(e.g., preservation of state variables). Standby components remain available at all times except for
maintenance issues or recovery failures in progress. Related controls: CP-2, CP-10, MA-6.
Control Enhancements:

PREDICTABLE FAILURE PREVENTION | FAILOVER CAPABILITY

The organization provides [Selection: real-time; near real-time] [Assignment: organization-defined
failover capability] for the information system.
Supplemental Guidance: Failover refers to the automatic switchover to an alternate information

system upon the failure of the primary information system. Failover capability includes, for
example, incorporating mirrored information system operations at alternate processing sites or
periodic data mirroring at regular intervals defined by recovery time periods of organizations.

NON-PERSISTENCE
Control: The organization implements non-persistent [Assignment: organization-defined

information system components and services] that are initiated in a known state and terminated
[Selection (one or more): upon end of session of use; periodically at [Assignment: organizationdefined frequency]].
Supplemental Guidance: This control mitigates risk from advanced persistent threats (APTs) by

significantly reducing the targeting capability of adversaries (i.e., window of opportunity and
available attack surface) to initiate and complete cyber attacks. By implementing the concept of
non-persistence for selected information system components, organizations can provide a known
state computing resource for a specific period of time that does not give adversaries sufficient time
on target to exploit vulnerabilities in organizational information systems and the environments in
which those systems operate. Since the advanced persistent threat is a high-end threat with regard
to capability, intent, and targeting, organizations assume that over an extended period of time, a
percentage of cyber attacks will be successful. Non-persistent information system components and
services are activated as required using protected information and terminated periodically or upon
the end of sessions. Non-persistence increases the work factor of adversaries in attempting to
compromise or breach organizational information systems.
Non-persistent system components can be implemented, for example, by periodically re-imaging
components or by using a variety of common virtualization techniques. Non-persistent services
can be implemented using virtualization techniques as part of virtual machines or as new instances
of processes on physical machines (either persistent or non-persistent).The benefit of periodic
refreshes of information system components/services is that it does not require organizations to
first determine whether compromises of components or services have occurred (something that
may often be difficult for organizations to determine). The refresh of selected information system
components and services occurs with sufficient frequency to prevent the spread or intended impact
of attacks, but not with such frequency that it makes the information system unstable. In some
instances, refreshes of critical components and services may be done periodically in order to
hinder the ability of adversaries to exploit optimum windows of vulnerabilities. Related controls:
SC-30, SC-34.
Control Enhancements:
(1)

NON-PERSISTENCE | REFRESH FROM TRUSTED SOURCES

The organization ensures that software and data employed during information system component
and service refreshes are obtained from [Assignment: organization-defined trusted sources].

that are unexpected or inconsistent with the output results that would normally be expected from
software programs or applications. This control enhancement focuses on detecting extraneous
content, preventing such extraneous content from being displayed, and alerting monitoring tools
that anomalous behavior has been discovered. Related controls: SI-3, SI-4.

INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAMS
ORGANIZATION-WIDE INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM MANAGEMENT CONTROLS

T

he Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) requires organizations to
develop and implement an organization-wide information security program to address
information security for the information and information systems that support the
operations and assets of the organization, including those provided or managed by another
organization, contractor, or other source. The information security program management (PM)
controls described in this appendix are typically implemented at the organization level and not
directed at individual organizational information systems. The program management controls
have been designed to facilitate compliance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders,
directives, policies, regulations, and standards. The controls are independent of any FIPS
Publication 200 impact levels and therefore, are not directly associated with any of the security
control baselines described in Appendix D. The program management controls do, however,
complement the security controls in Appendix F and focus on the programmatic, organizationwide information security requirements that are independent of any particular information system
and are essential for managing information security programs. Tailoring guidance can be applied
to the program management controls in a manner similar to how the guidance is applied to
security controls in Appendix F. Organizations specify the individual or individuals responsible
and accountable for the development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and monitoring
of the program management controls. Organizations document program management controls in
the information security program plan. The organization-wide information security program plan
supplements the individual security plans developed for each organizational information system.
Together, the security plans for the individual information systems and the information security
program cover the totality of security controls employed by the organization.

In addition to documenting the information security program management controls, the security
program plan provides a vehicle for the organization, in a central repository, to document all
security controls from Appendix F that have been designated as common controls (i.e., security
controls inheritable by organizational information systems). 111 The information security program
management controls and common controls contained in the information security program plan
are implemented, assessed for effectiveness, 112 and authorized by a senior organizational official,
with the same or similar authority and responsibility for managing risk as the authorization
officials for information systems. Plans of action and milestones are developed and maintained
for the program management and common controls that are deemed through assessment to be less
than effective. Information security program management and common controls are also subject
to the same continuous monitoring requirements as security controls employed in individual
organizational information systems.
Table G-1 provides a summary of the security controls in the program management family from
Appendix G. Organizations can use the recommended priority code designation associated with
each program management control to assist in making sequencing decisions for implementation
111

Common controls are those security controls that are inheritable by one or more organizational information systems,
and thus are separate and distinct from information security program management controls.
112

Assessment procedures for program management controls and common controls can be found in NIST Special
Publication 800-53A.

Cautionary Note
Organizations are required to implement security program management controls to provide a foundation
for the organizational information security program. The successful implementation of security controls
for organizational information systems depends on the successful implementation of organization-wide
program management controls. However, the manner in which organizations implement the program
management controls depends on specific organizational characteristics including, for example, the size,
complexity, and mission/business requirements of the respective organizations.

________________________________________________________________________________________________
PM-1

INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM PLAN
Control: The organization:

a.

Develops and disseminates an organization-wide information security program plan that:
1.

Provides an overview of the requirements for the security program and a description of
the security program management controls and common controls in place or planned for
meeting those requirements;

2.

Includes the identification and assignment of roles, responsibilities, management
commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance;

3.

Reflects coordination among organizational entities responsible for the different aspects
of information security (i.e., technical, physical, personnel, cyber-physical); and

4.

Is approved by a senior official with responsibility and accountability for the risk being
incurred to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, and
reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation;

b.

Reviews the organization-wide information security program plan [Assignment: organizationdefined frequency];

c.

Updates the plan to address organizational changes and problems identified during plan
implementation or security control assessments; and

d.

Protects the information security program plan from unauthorized disclosure and
modification.

Supplemental Guidance: Information security program plans can be represented in single documents

or compilations of documents at the discretion of organizations. The plans document the program
management controls and organization-defined common controls. Information security program
plans provide sufficient information about the program management controls/common controls
(including specification of parameters for any assignment and selection statements either explicitly
or by reference) to enable implementations that are unambiguously compliant with the intent of
the plans and a determination of the risk to be incurred if the plans are implemented as intended.
The security plans for individual information systems and the organization-wide information
security program plan together, provide complete coverage for all security controls employed
within the organization. Common controls are documented in an appendix to the organization’s
information security program plan unless the controls are included in a separate security plan for
an information system (e.g., security controls employed as part of an intrusion detection system
providing organization-wide boundary protection inherited by one or more organizational
information systems). The organization-wide information security program plan will indicate
which separate security plans contain descriptions of common controls.
Organizations have the flexibility to describe common controls in a single document or in multiple
documents. In the case of multiple documents, the documents describing common controls are
included as attachments to the information security program plan. If the information security
program plan contains multiple documents, the organization specifies in each document the
organizational official or officials responsible for the development, implementation, assessment,
authorization, and monitoring of the respective common controls. For example, the organization
may require that the Facilities Management Office develop, implement, assess, authorize, and
continuously monitor common physical and environmental protection controls from the PE family
when such controls are not associated with a particular information system but instead, support
multiple information systems. Related control: PM-8.

SENIOR INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER
Control: The organization appoints a senior information security officer with the mission and

resources to coordinate, develop, implement, and maintain an organization-wide information
security program.
Supplemental Guidance: The security officer described in this control is an organizational official.

For a federal agency (as defined in applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies,
or regulations) this official is the Senior Agency Information Security Officer. Organizations may
also refer to this official as the Senior Information Security Officer or Chief Information Security
Officer.

INFORMATION SECURITY RESOURCES
Control: The organization:

a.

Ensures that all capital planning and investment requests include the resources needed to
implement the information security program and documents all exceptions to this
requirement;

b.

Employs a business case/Exhibit 300/Exhibit 53 to record the resources required; and

c.

Ensures that information security resources are available for expenditure as planned.

Supplemental Guidance: Organizations consider establishing champions for information security

efforts and as part of including the necessary resources, assign specialized expertise and resources
as needed. Organizations may designate and empower an Investment Review Board (or similar
group) to manage and provide oversight for the information security-related aspects of the capital
planning and investment control process. Related controls: PM-4, SA-2.
Control Enhancements: None.

PM-4

PLAN OF ACTION AND MILESTONES PROCESS
Control: The organization:

a.

b.

Implements a process for ensuring that plans of action and milestones for the security
program and associated organizational information systems:
1.

Are developed and maintained;

2.

Document the remedial information security actions to adequately respond to risk to
organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation; and

3.

Are reported in accordance with OMB FISMA reporting requirements.

Reviews plans of action and milestones for consistency with the organizational risk
management strategy and organization-wide priorities for risk response actions.

Supplemental Guidance: The plan of action and milestones is a key document in the information

security program and is subject to federal reporting requirements established by OMB. With the
increasing emphasis on organization-wide risk management across all three tiers in the risk
management hierarchy (i.e., organization, mission/business process, and information system),
organizations view plans of action and milestones from an organizational perspective, prioritizing
risk response actions and ensuring consistency with the goals and objectives of the organization.
Plan of action and milestones updates are based on findings from security control assessments and

PM-7

ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE
Control: The organization develops an enterprise architecture with consideration for information

security and the resulting risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other
organizations, and the Nation.
Supplemental Guidance: The enterprise architecture developed by the organization is aligned with

the Federal Enterprise Architecture. The integration of information security requirements and
associated security controls into the organization’s enterprise architecture helps to ensure that
security considerations are addressed by organizations early in the system development life cycle
and are directly and explicitly related to the organization’s mission/business processes. This
process of security requirements integration also embeds into the enterprise architecture, an
integral information security architecture consistent with organizational risk management and
information security strategies. For PM-7, the information security architecture is developed at a
system-of-systems level (organization-wide), representing all of the organizational information
systems. For PL-8, the information security architecture is developed at a level representing an
individual information system but at the same time, is consistent with the information security
architecture defined for the organization. Security requirements and security control integration
are most effectively accomplished through the application of the Risk Management Framework
and supporting security standards and guidelines. The Federal Segment Architecture Methodology
provides guidance on integrating information security requirements and security controls into
enterprise architectures. Related controls: PL-2, PL-8, PM-11, RA-2, SA-3.

CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN
Control: The organization addresses information security issues in the development,

documentation, and updating of a critical infrastructure and key resources protection plan.
Supplemental Guidance: Protection strategies are based on the prioritization of critical assets and

resources. The requirement and guidance for defining critical infrastructure and key resources and
for preparing an associated critical infrastructure protection plan are found in applicable federal
laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. Related

RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY
Control: The organization:

a.

Develops a comprehensive strategy to manage risk to organizational operations and assets,
individuals, other organizations, and the Nation associated with the operation and use of
information systems;

b.

Implements the risk management strategy consistently across the organization; and

c.

Reviews and updates the risk management strategy [Assignment: organization-defined
frequency] or as required, to address organizational changes.

Supplemental Guidance: An organization-wide risk management strategy includes, for example, an

unambiguous expression of the risk tolerance for the organization, acceptable risk assessment
methodologies, risk mitigation strategies, a process for consistently evaluating risk across the
organization with respect to the organization’s risk tolerance, and approaches for monitoring risk
over time. The use of a risk executive function can facilitate consistent, organization-wide
application of the risk management strategy. The organization-wide risk management strategy can
be informed by risk-related inputs from other sources both internal and external to the organization
to ensure the strategy is both broad-based and comprehensive. Related control: RA-3.
Control Enhancements: None.

SECURITY AUTHORIZATION PROCESS
Control: The organization:

a.

Manages (i.e., documents, tracks, and reports) the security state of organizational information
systems and the environments in which those systems operate through security authorization
processes;

b.

Designates individuals to fulfill specific roles and responsibilities within the organizational
risk management process; and

c.

Fully integrates the security authorization processes into an organization-wide risk
management program.

Supplemental Guidance: Security authorization processes for information systems and environments

of operation require the implementation of an organization-wide risk management process, a Risk
Management Framework, and associated security standards and guidelines. Specific roles within
the risk management process include an organizational risk executive (function) and designated
authorizing officials for each organizational information system and common control provider.
Security authorization processes are integrated with organizational continuous monitoring

MISSION/BUSINESS PROCESS DEFINITION
Control: The organization:

a.

Defines mission/business processes with consideration for information security and the
resulting risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other
organizations, and the Nation; and

b.

Determines information protection needs arising from the defined mission/business processes
and revises the processes as necessary, until achievable protection needs are obtained.

Supplemental Guidance: Information protection needs are technology-independent, required

capabilities to counter threats to organizations, individuals, or the Nation through the compromise
of information (i.e., loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability). Information protection needs
are derived from the mission/business needs defined by the organization, the mission/business
processes selected to meet the stated needs, and the organizational risk management strategy.
Information protection needs determine the required security controls for the organization and the
associated information systems supporting the mission/business processes. Inherent in defining an
organization’s information protection needs is an understanding of the level of adverse impact that
could result if a compromise of information occurs. The security categorization process is used to
make such potential impact determinations. Mission/business process definitions and associated
information protection requirements are documented by the organization in accordance with
organizational policy and procedure. Related controls: PM-7, PM-8, RA-2.
Control Enhancements: None.
References: FIPS Publication 199; NIST Special Publication 800-60.

PM-12

INSIDER THREAT PROGRAM
Control: The organization implements an insider threat program that includes a cross-discipline
insider threat incident handling team.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations handling classified information are required, under

Executive Order 13587 and the National Policy on Insider Threat, to establish insider threat
programs. The standards and guidelines that apply to insider threat programs in classified
environments can also be employed effectively to improve the security of Controlled Unclassified
Information in non-national security systems. Insider threat programs include security controls to
detect and prevent malicious insider activity through the centralized integration and analysis of
both technical and non-technical information to identify potential insider threat concerns. A senior
organizational official is designated by the department/agency head as the responsible individual
to implement and provide oversight for the program. In addition to the centralized integration and
analysis capability, insider threat programs as a minimum, prepare department/agency insider
threat policies and implementation plans, conduct host-based user monitoring of individual
employee activities on government-owned classified computers, provide insider threat awareness
training to employees, receive access to information from all offices within the department/agency
(e.g., human resources, legal, physical security, personnel security, information technology,
information system security, and law enforcement) for insider threat analysis, and conduct selfassessments of department/agency insider threat posture.
Insider threat programs can leverage the existence of incident handling teams organizations may
already have in place, such as computer security incident response teams. Human resources

records are especially important in this effort, as there is compelling evidence to show that some
types of insider crimes are often preceded by nontechnical behaviors in the workplace (e.g.,
ongoing patterns of disgruntled behavior and conflicts with coworkers and other colleagues).
These precursors can better inform and guide organizational officials in more focused, targeted
monitoring efforts. The participation of a legal team is important to ensure that all monitoring
activities are performed in accordance with appropriate legislation, directives, regulations,
policies, standards, and guidelines. Related controls: AC-6, AT-2, AU-6, AU-7, AU-10, AU-12,

INFORMATION SECURITY WORKFORCE
Control: The organization establishes an information security workforce development and
improvement program.
Supplemental Guidance: Information security workforce development and improvement programs

include, for example: (i) defining the knowledge and skill levels needed to perform information
security duties and tasks; (ii) developing role-based training programs for individuals assigned
information security roles and responsibilities; and (iii) providing standards for measuring and
building individual qualifications for incumbents and applicants for information security-related
positions. Such workforce programs can also include associated information security career paths
to encourage: (i) information security professionals to advance in the field and fill positions with
greater responsibility; and (ii) organizations to fill information security-related positions with
qualified personnel. Information security workforce development and improvement programs are
complementary to organizational security awareness and training programs. Information security
workforce development and improvement programs focus on developing and institutionalizing
core information security capabilities of selected personnel needed to protect organizational
operations, assets, and individuals. Related controls: AT-2, AT-3.
Control Enhancements: None.

1.

Are developed and maintained; and

2.

Continue to be executed in a timely manner;

Reviews testing, training, and monitoring plans for consistency with the organizational risk
management strategy and organization-wide priorities for risk response actions.

Supplemental Guidance: This control ensures that organizations provide oversight for the security

testing, training, and monitoring activities conducted organization-wide and that those activities
are coordinated. With the importance of continuous monitoring programs, the implementation of
information security across the three tiers of the risk management hierarchy, and the widespread
use of common controls, organizations coordinate and consolidate the testing and monitoring
activities that are routinely conducted as part of ongoing organizational assessments supporting a
variety of security controls. Security training activities, while typically focused on individual
information systems and specific roles, also necessitate coordination across all organizational
elements. Testing, training, and monitoring plans and activities are informed by current threat and
vulnerability assessments. Related controls: AT-3, CA-7, CP-4, IR-3, SI-4.

CONTACTS WITH SECURITY GROUPS AND ASSOCIATIONS
Control: The organization establishes and institutionalizes contact with selected groups and

associations within the security community:
a.

To facilitate ongoing security education and training for organizational personnel;

b.

To maintain currency with recommended security practices, techniques, and technologies; and

c.

To share current security-related information including threats, vulnerabilities, and incidents.

Supplemental Guidance: Ongoing contact with security groups and associations is of paramount

importance in an environment of rapidly changing technologies and threats. Security groups and
associations include, for example, special interest groups, forums, professional associations, news
groups, and/or peer groups of security professionals in similar organizations. Organizations select
groups and associations based on organizational missions/business functions. Organizations share
threat, vulnerability, and incident information consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive
Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. Related control: SI-5.
Control Enhancements: None.
References: None.

PM-16

THREAT AWARENESS PROGRAM
Control: The organization implements a threat awareness program that includes a crossorganization information-sharing capability.
Supplemental Guidance: Because of the constantly changing and increasing sophistication of

adversaries, especially the advanced persistent threat (APT), it is becoming more likely that
adversaries may successfully breach or compromise organizational information systems. One of
the best techniques to address this concern is for organizations to share threat information. This
can include, for example, sharing threat events (i.e., tactics, techniques, and procedures) that
organizations have experienced, mitigations that organizations have found are effective against
certain types of threats, threat intelligence (i.e., indications and warnings about threats that are
likely to occur). Threat information sharing may be bilateral (e.g., government-commercial
cooperatives, government-government cooperatives), or multilateral (e.g., organizations taking
part in threat-sharing consortia). Threat information may be highly sensitive requiring special
agreements and protection, or less sensitive and freely shared. Related controls: PM-12, PM-16.
Control Enhancements: None.
References: None.

INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION SECURITY STANDARDS
SECURITY CONTROL MAPPINGS FOR ISO/IEC 27001 AND 15408

T

he mapping tables in this appendix provide organizations with a general indication of
security control coverage with respect to ISO/IEC 27001, Information technology–Security
techniques–Information security management systems–Requirements 113 and ISO/IEC
15408, Information technology -- Security techniques -- Evaluation criteria for IT security. 114
ISO/IEC 27001 may be applied to all types of organizations and specifies requirements for
establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining, and improving a
documented information security management system (ISMS) within the context of business
risks. NIST Special Publication 800-39 includes guidance on managing risk at the organizational
level, mission/business process level, and information system level, is consistent with ISO/IEC
27001, and provides additional implementation detail for the federal government and its
contractors. ISO/IEC 15408 (also known as the Common Criteria) provides functionality and
assurance requirements for developers of information systems and information system
components (i.e., information technology products). Since many of the technical security controls
defined in Appendix F are implemented in hardware, software, and firmware components of
information systems, organizations can obtain significant benefit from the acquisition and
employment of information technology products evaluated against the requirements of ISO/IEC
15408. The use of such products can provide evidence that certain security controls are
implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired effect in satisfying stated
security requirements.
Previously, the ISO/IEC 27001 mappings were created by relating the primary security topic
identified in each of the Special Publication 800-53 base controls to a similar security topic in the
ISO/IEC standard. This methodology resulted in a mapping of security control relationships
rather than a mapping of equivalent security control requirements. The ISO/IEC 27001:2013
update provided an opportunity to reassess whether the implementation of a security control from
Special Publication 800-53 satisfied the intent of the mapped control from ISO/IEC 27001 and
conversely, whether the implementation of a security control from ISO/IEC 27001 satisfied the
intent of the mapped control from Special Publication 800-53. To successfully meet the mapping
criteria, the implementation of the mapped controls should result in an equivalent information
security posture. However, this does not mean that security control equivalency based solely on
the mapping tables herein should be assumed by organizations. While the revised security control
mappings are more accurate, there is still some degree of subjectivity in the mapping analysis
because the mappings are not always one-to-one and may not be completely equivalent. The
following examples illustrate some of the mapping issues:
•

Example 1: Special Publication 800-53 contingency planning and ISO/IEC 27001 business
continuity management were deemed to have similar, but not the same, functionality.

•

Example 2: In some cases, similar topics are addressed in the two security control sets but
provide a different context, perspective, or scope. Special Publication 800-53 addresses

113

ISO/IEC 27001 was published in October 2013 by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).
114

ISO/IEC 15408 was published in September 2012 by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and
the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).

information flow control broadly in terms of approved authorizations for controlling access
between source and destination objects, whereas ISO/IEC 27001 addresses information flow
more narrowly as it applies to interconnected network domains.
•

Example 3: Security control A.6.1.1, Information Security Roles and Responsibilities, in
ISO/IEC 27001 states that “all information security responsibilities shall be defined and
allocated” while security control PM-10, Security Authorization Process, in Special
Publication 800-53 that is mapped to A.6.1.1, has three distinct parts. The first part states that
the organization “designates individuals to fulfill specific roles and responsibilities…” If
A.6.1.1 is mapped to PM-10 without providing any additional information, organizations
might assume that if they implement A.6.1.1 (i.e., all responsibilities are defined and
allocated), then the intent of PM-10 would also be fully satisfied. However, this would not be
the case since the other two parts of PM-10 would not have been addressed. To resolve and
clarify the security control mappings, when a security control in the right column of Tables
H-1 and H-2 does not fully satisfy the intent of the security control in the left column of the
tables, the control in the right column is designated with an asterisk (*).

In a few cases, an ISO/IEC 27001 security control could only be directly mapped to a Special
Publication 800-53 control enhancement. In such cases, the relevant enhancement is specified in
Table H-2 indicating that the corresponding ISO/IEC 27001 control satisfies only the intent of the
specified enhancement and does not address the associated base control from Special Publication
800-53 or any other enhancements under that base control. Where no enhancement is specified,
the ISO/IEC 27001 control is relevant only to the Special Publication 800-53 base control.
And finally, the security controls from ISO/IEC 27002 were not considered in the mapping
analysis since the standard is informative rather than normative.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Table H-3 provides a generalized mapping from the functional and assurance requirements in
ISO/IEC 15408 (Common Criteria) to the security controls in Special Publication 800-53. The
table represents an informal correspondence between security requirements and security controls
(i.e., the table is not intended to determine whether the ISO/IEC 15408 security requirements are
fully, partially, or not satisfied by the associated security controls). However, the table can serve
as a beneficial starting point for further correspondence analysis. Organizations are cautioned that
satisfying ISO/IEC 15408 security requirements for an particular evaluated and validated
information technology product as represented by the presence of certain security controls from
Appendix F, does not imply that such requirements have been satisfied throughout the entire
information system (which may consist of multiple, integrated individual component products).
Additional information explaining the specific mappings that appear in Table H-3 is available at
the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) website at: http://www.niap-ccevs.org.

OVERLAY TEMPLATE
APPLYING TAILORING GUIDANCE FOR SPECIAL CONDITIONS OR COMMUNITY-WIDE USE

116

O

rganizations may use the following template when developing tailored baselines using the
concept of overlays. 117 The template is provided as an example only—organizations may
choose to use other formats or modify the format in this appendix based on organizational
needs and the type of overlay being developed. The level of detail included in the overlay is at the
discretion of the organization initiating the overlay but should be of sufficient breadth and depth
to provide an appropriate rationale and justification for the resulting tailored baseline developed,
including any risk-based decisions made during the overlay development process. Security
control baseline tailoring using the concept of overlays results in security plans that are subject to
approval by authorizing officials. The example template consists of eight sections:
•

Identification;

•

Overlay Characteristics;

•

Applicability;

•

Overlay Summary;

•

Detailed Overlay Control Specifications;

•

Tailoring Considerations;

•

Definitions; and

•

Additional Information or Instructions.

How Overlays Can Be Used
Within the Risk Management Framework (RMF), overlays are implemented as part of the
tailoring process after the completion of an initial security categorization process described in
Section 3.1 and any organization-specific guidance. The security categorization process results in
the determination of an impact level of the information system, and is subsequently used to select
an initial set of security controls from one of the security control baselines in Appendix D. 118
After the initial set of security controls is identified, organizations initiate the tailoring process to
modify and align the controls more closely with the specific conditions within the organizations.
Overlays provide tailoring guidance from a community-wide perspective to address specialized
requirements, missions/business functions, technologies, or environments of operation. Overlays
provide uniformity and efficiency of security control selection by presenting tailoring options

116

Tailored baselines produced using the concept of overlays can be published independently in a variety of venues and
publications including, for example, OMB policies, CNSS Instructions, NIST Special Publications, industry standards,
and sector-specific guidance. As part of the overlay initiative, the previous guidance in Appendix I regarding industrial
and process control system security will be transferred to NIST Special Publication 800-82.
117
While organizations are encouraged to use the overlay concept to tailor security control baselines, generating widely
divergent overlays on the same topic may prove to be counterproductive. The overlay concept is most effective when
communities of interest work together to create consensus-based overlays that are not duplicative.
118
CNSS Instruction 1253 provides security categorization guidance and security control baselines for national security
systems.

developed by security experts and other subject matter experts to information system owners
responsible for implementing and maintaining such systems.
There is a considerable range of options that can be used to construct overlays, depending on the
specificity desired by the overlay developers. Some overlays may be very specific with respect to
the hardware, firmware, and software that form the key components the information system and
the environment in which the system operates. Other overlays may be more abstract in order to be
applicable to a large class of information systems that may be deployed in different environments.
The example template described below can be used for any level of specificity on this continuum
of potential options for overlays.
Overlays that provide greater specificity are typically developed by organizations with authority
over the information system owners and environments of operation. Organizations decide on the
appropriate tailoring actions for the selected baseline security controls as described in Section 3.2.
Many of the variables and conditions that qualify the overlay for use on a specific information
system are made explicit to ensure consistency when applying the overlay. Overlays that provide
less specificity can also be developed by security and subject matter experts for application to
large classes of information systems or in situations where there is less than full knowledge about
the specific implementation details related to the system. Less specific overlays may require
additional tailoring to customize the set of security controls for the specific information system.
These overlays leave many of the assignment and selection statements in the security controls
(i.e., the variable portion of the controls) to be completed by the organization that owns and
operates the information system. The eight sections comprising the overlay are described below.
Identification
Organizations identify the overlay by providing: (i) a unique name for the overlay; (ii) a version
number and date; (iii) the version of NIST Special Publication 800-53 used to create the overlay;
(iv) other documentation used to create the overlay; (v) author or authoring group and point of
contact; and (vi) type of organizational approval received. Organizations define how long the
overlay is to be in effect and any events that may trigger an update to the overlay other than
changes to NIST Special Publication 800-53 or organization-specific security guidance. If there
are no unique events that can trigger an update for the overlay, this section provides that notation.
Overlay Characteristics
Organizations describe the characteristics that define the intended use of the overlay in order to
help potential users select the most appropriate overlay for their missions/business functions. This
may include, for example, a description of: (i) the environment in which the information system
will be used (e.g., inside a guarded building within the continental United States, in an unmanned
space vehicle, while traveling for business to a foreign country that is known for attempting to
gain access to sensitive or classified information, or in a mobile vehicle that is in close proximity
to hostile entities); (ii) the type of information that will be processed, stored, or transmitted (e.g.,
personal identity and authentication information, financial management information, facilities,
fleet, and equipment management information, defense and national security information, system
development information); (iii) the functionality within the information system or the type of
system (e.g., standalone system, industrial/process control system, or cross-domain system); and
(iv) other characteristics related to the overlay that help protect organizational missions/business
functions, information systems, information, or individuals from a specific set of threats that may
not be addressed by the assumptions described in Chapter Three.

APPENDIX I

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Applicability
Organizations provide criteria to assist potential users of the overlay in determining whether or
not the overlay applies to a particular information system or environment of operation. Typical
formats include, for example, a list of questions or a decision tree based on the description of the
characteristics of the information system (including associated applications) and its environment
of operation at the level of specificity appropriate to the overlay.
Overlay Summary
Organizations provide a brief summary of the salient characteristics of the overlay. This summary
may include, for example: (i) the security controls and control enhancements that are affected by
the overlay; (ii) an indication of which controls/enhancements are selected or not selected based
on the characteristics and assumptions in the overlay, the tailoring guidance provided in Section
3.2, or any organization-specific guidance; (iii) the selected controls/enhancements including an
overview of new supplemental guidance and parameter values; and (iv) references to applicable
laws, Executive Orders, directives, instructions, regulations, policies, or standards.
Detailed Overlay Control Specifications
Organizations provide a comprehensive expression of the security controls/control enhancements
in the overlay as part of the tailoring process. This may include, for example: (i) justification for
selecting or not selecting a specific security control/control enhancement; (ii) modifications to the
supplemental guidance or the addition of new supplemental guidance for the security controls and
control enhancements to address the characteristics of the overlay and the environments in which
the overlay is intended to operate; (iii) unique parameter values for security control selection or
assignment statements; (iv) specific statutory and/or regulatory requirements (above and beyond
FISMA) that are met by a security control or control enhancement; (v) recommendations for
compensating controls, as appropriate; and (vi) guidance that extends the basic capability of the
control/enhancement by specifying additional functionality, altering the strength of mechanism,
or adding or limiting implementation options.
Tailoring Considerations
Organizations provide information to information system owners and authorizing officials to
consider during the tailoring process when determining the set of security controls applicable to
their specific information systems. This is especially important for overlays that are used in an
environment of operation different from the one assumed by the security control baselines (as
defined in Section 3.1). In addition, organizations can provide guidance on the use of multiple
overlays applied to a security control baseline and address any potential conflicts that may arise
between overlay specifications and baseline controls.
Definitions
Organizations provide any terms and associated definitions that are unique and relevant to the
overlay. The terms and definitions are listed in alphabetical order. If there are no unique terms or
definitions for the overlay, this is stated in this section.
Additional Information or Instructions
Organizations provide any additional information or instructions relevant to the overlay not
covered in the previous sections.

T

he need to protect an individual's privacy is as important today as it was in 1974 when the
Privacy Act first sought to balance the government's need to collect information from an
individual with a citizen's right to be notified as to how that information was being used,
collected, maintained, and disposed of after the requisite period of use. These concerns are also
shared in the private sector, where healthcare, financial, and other services continue to be
delivered via the web with increasingly higher levels of personalization. The proliferation of
social media, Smart Grid, mobile, and cloud computing, as well as the transition from structured
to unstructured data and metadata environments, have added significant complexities and
challenges for federal organizations in safeguarding privacy. These challenges extend well
beyond the traditional information technology security view of protecting privacy which focused
primarily on ensuring confidentiality. Now there are greater implications with respect to
controlling the integrity of an individual's information, and with ensuring that an individual's
information is available on demand. The challenging landscape requires federal organizations to
expand their view of privacy, in order to meet citizen expectations of privacy that go beyond
information security.

Privacy, with respect to personally identifiable information (PII), 119 is a core value that can be
obtained only with appropriate legislation, policies, procedures, and associated controls to ensure
compliance with requirements. Protecting the privacy of individuals and their PII that is collected,
used, maintained, shared, and disposed of by programs and information systems, is a fundamental
responsibility of federal organizations. Privacy also involves each individual’s right to decide
when and whether to share personal information, how much information to share, and the
particular circumstances under which that information can be shared. In today’s digital world,
effective privacy for individuals depends on the safeguards employed within the information
systems that are processing, storing, and transmitting PII and the environments in which those
systems operate. Organizations cannot have effective privacy without a basic foundation of
information security. Privacy is more than security, however, and includes, for example, the
principles of transparency, notice, and choice.
This appendix provides a structured set of controls for protecting privacy and serves as a roadmap
for organizations to use in identifying and implementing privacy controls concerning the entire
life cycle of PII, whether in paper or electronic form. The controls focus on information privacy
as a value distinct from, but highly interrelated with, information security. Privacy controls are
119

OMB Memorandum 07-16 defines PII as information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s
identity such as their name, social security number, biometric records, etc., alone, or when combined with other
personal or identifying information which is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such as date and place of birth,
mother’s maiden name, etc. OMB Memorandum 10-22 further states that “the definition of PII is not anchored to any
single category of information or technology. Rather, it requires a case-by-case assessment of the specific risk that an
individual can be identified by examining the context of use and combination of data elements. In performing this
assessment, it is important for agencies to recognize that non-PII can become PII, whenever additional information is
made publicly available, in any medium and from any source that, when combined with other available information,
could be used to identify an individual.” NIST Special Publication 800-122 also includes a definition of PII that differs
from this appendix because it was focused on the security objective of confidentiality and not privacy in the broad
sense. Organizational definitions of PII may vary based on the consideration of additional regulatory requirements. The
privacy controls in this appendix apply regardless of the definition of PII by organizations.

the administrative, technical, and physical safeguards employed within organizations to protect
and ensure the proper handling of PII. 120 Organizations may also engage in activities that do not
involve the collection and use of PII, but may nevertheless raise privacy concerns and associated
risk. The privacy controls are equally applicable to those activities and can be used to analyze the
privacy risk and mitigate such risk when necessary.
The privacy controls in this appendix are based on the Fair Information Practice Principles
(FIPPs) 121 embodied in the Privacy Act of 1974, Section 208 of the E-Government Act of 2002,
and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) policies. The FIPPs are designed to build public
trust in the privacy practices of organizations and to help organizations avoid tangible costs and
intangible damages from privacy incidents. There are eight privacy control families, each aligning
with one of the FIPPs. The privacy families can be implemented at the organization, department,
agency, component, office, program, or information system level, under the leadership and
oversight of the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) 122 and
in coordination with the Chief Information Security Officer, Chief Information Officer, program
officials, legal counsel, and others as appropriate. Table J-1 provides a summary of the privacy
controls by family in the privacy control catalog.

In 2010, the Federal CIO Council Privacy Committee issued a framework for designing and implementing a privacy
program entitled Best Practices: Elements of a Federal Privacy Program (Elements White Paper). The privacy controls
in this appendix mirror a number of the elements included in the paper. Organizations can use the privacy controls and
the guidance in the paper to develop an organization-wide privacy program or enhance an already existing program.
121

The FIPPs are widely accepted in the United States and internationally as a general framework for privacy and are
reflected in other federal and international laws and policies. In a number of organizations, FIPPs serve as the basis for
analyzing privacy risks and determining appropriate mitigation strategies. The Federal Enterprise Architecture Security
and Privacy Profile (FEA-SPP) also provided information and materials in development of the privacy controls.
122

All federal agencies and departments designate an SAOP/CPO as the senior organizational official with the overall
organization-wide responsibility for information privacy issues. OMB Memorandum 05-08 provides guidance for the
designation of SAOPs/CPOs. The term SAOP/CPO as used in this appendix means an organization’s senior privacy
leader, whose job title may vary from organization to organization.

There is a strong similarity between the structure of the privacy controls in this appendix and the
structure of the security controls in Appendices F and G. For example, the control AR-1
(Governance and Privacy Program) requires organizations to develop privacy plans that can be
implemented at the organizational or program level. These plans can also be used in conjunction
with security plans to provide an opportunity for organizations to select the appropriate set of
security and privacy controls in accordance with organizational mission/business requirements
and the environments in which the organizations operate. Incorporating the fundamental concepts
associated with managing information security risk helps to ensure that the employment of
privacy controls is carried out in a cost-effective and risk-based manner while simultaneously
meeting compliance requirements. Standardized privacy controls and assessment procedures
(developed to evaluate the effectiveness of the controls) will provide a more disciplined and
structured approach for satisfying federal privacy requirements and demonstrating compliance
with those requirements.
In summary, the Privacy Appendix achieves several important objectives. The appendix:
•

Provides a structured set of privacy controls, based on best practices, that helps organizations
comply with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, instructions, regulations,
policies, standards, guidance, and organization-specific issuances;

•

Establishes a linkage and relationship between privacy and security controls for purposes of
enforcing respective privacy and security requirements that may overlap in concept and in
implementation within federal information systems, programs, and organizations;

•

Demonstrates the applicability of the NIST Risk Management Framework in the selection,
implementation, assessment, and ongoing monitoring of privacy controls deployed in federal
information systems, programs, and organizations; and

•

Promotes closer cooperation between privacy and security officials within the federal
government to help achieve the objectives of senior leaders/executives in enforcing the
requirements in federal privacy legislation, policies, regulations, directives, standards, and
guidance.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

HOW TO USE THIS APPENDIX
The privacy controls outlined in this publication are primarily for use by an organization’s Senior
Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) when working with program managers,
mission/business owners, information owners/stewards, Chief Information Officers, Chief Information
Security Officers, information system developers/integrators, and risk executives to determine how
best to incorporate effective privacy protections and practices (i.e., privacy controls) within
organizational programs and information systems and the environments in which they operate. The
privacy controls facilitate the organization’s efforts to comply with privacy requirements affecting those
organizational programs and/or systems that collect, use, maintain, share, or dispose of personally
identifiable information (PII) or other activities that raise privacy risks. While the security controls in
Appendix F are allocated to the low, moderate, and high baselines in Appendix D, the privacy controls
are selected and implemented based on the privacy requirements of organizations and the need to
protect the PII of individuals collected and maintained by organizational information systems and
programs, in accordance with federal privacy legislation, policies, directives, regulations, guidelines, and
best practices.
Organizations analyze and apply each privacy control with respect to their distinct mission/business and
operational needs based on their legal authorities and obligations. Implementation of the privacy
controls may vary based upon this analysis (e.g., organizations that are defined as covered entities
pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [HIPAA] may have additional
requirements that are not specifically enumerated in this publication). This enables organizations to
determine the information practices that are compliant with law and policy and those that may need
review. It also enables organizations to tailor the privacy controls to meet their defined and specific
needs at the organization level, mission/business process level, and information system level.
Organizations with national security or law enforcement authorities take those authorities as well as
privacy interests into account in determining how to apply the privacy controls in their operational
environments. Similarly, organizations subject to the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical
Efficiency Act (CIPSEA), implement the privacy controls consistent with that Act. All organizations
implement the privacy controls consistent with the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a, subject to any
exceptions and/or exemptions.
Privacy control enhancements described in Appendix J reflect best practices which organizations should
strive to achieve, but are not mandatory. Organizations should decide when to apply control
enhancements to support their particular missions/business functions. Specific overlays for privacy,
developed in accordance with the guidance in Section 3.2 and Appendix I, can also be considered to
facilitate the tailoring of the security control baselines in Appendix D with the requisite privacy controls
to ensure that both security and privacy requirements can be satisfied by organizations. Many of the
security controls in Appendix F provide the fundamental information protection for confidentiality,
integrity, and availability within organizational information systems and the environments in which
those systems operate—protection that is essential for strong and effective privacy.
Organizations document the agreed upon privacy controls to be implemented in organizational
programs and information systems and the environments in which they operate. At the discretion of
the implementing organization, privacy controls may be documented in a distinct privacy plan or
incorporated into other risk management documents (e.g., system security plans). Organizations also
establish appropriate assessment methodologies to determine the extent to which the privacy controls
are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to
meeting designated privacy requirements. Organizational assessments of privacy controls can be
conducted either by the SAOP/CPO alone or jointly with the other organizational risk management
offices including the information security office.

Implementation Tip
•

Select and implement privacy controls based on the privacy requirements of organizations and
the need to protect the personally identifiable information (PII) of individuals collected and
maintained by systems and programs.

•

Coordinate privacy control selection and implementation with the organizational Risk Executive
Function, mission/business owners, enterprise architects, Chief Information Officer, SAOP/CPO,
and Chief Information Security Officer.

•

View the privacy controls in Appendix J from the same perspective as the Program
Management controls in Appendix G—that is, the controls are implemented for each
organizational information system irrespective of the FIPS 199 categorization for that system.

•

Select and implement the optional privacy control enhancements when there is a demonstrated
need for additional privacy protection for individuals and PII.

•

Apply the privacy controls consistent with any specific exceptions and exemptions included in
legislation, Executive Orders, directives, policies, and regulations (e.g., law enforcement or
national security considerations).

FAMILY: AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE

This family ensures that organizations: (i) identify the legal bases that authorize a particular
personally identifiable information (PII) collection or activity that impacts privacy; and (ii) specify in
their notices the purpose(s) for which PII is collected.

AP-1

AUTHORITY TO COLLECT
Control: The organization determines and documents the legal authority that permits the collection,

use, maintenance, and sharing of personally identifiable information (PII), either generally or in
support of a specific program or information system need.
Supplemental Guidance: Before collecting PII, the organization determines whether the

contemplated collection of PII is legally authorized. Program officials consult with the Senior
Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) and legal counsel regarding the
authority of any program or activity to collect PII. The authority to collect PII is documented in
the System of Records Notice (SORN) and/or Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) or other
applicable documentation such as Privacy Act Statements or Computer Matching Agreements.
Related controls: AR-2, DM-1, TR-1, TR-2.
Control Enhancements: None.
References: The Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a (e); Section 208(c), E-Government Act of

2002 (P.L. 107-347); OMB Circular A-130, Appendix I.

AP-2

PURPOSE SPECIFICATION
Control: The organization describes the purpose(s) for which personally identifiable information

(PII) is collected, used, maintained, and shared in its privacy notices.
Supplemental Guidance: Often, statutory language expressly authorizes specific collections and uses

of PII. When statutory language is written broadly and thus subject to interpretation, organizations
ensure, in consultation with the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer
(CPO) and legal counsel, that there is a close nexus between the general authorization and any
specific collection of PII. Once the specific purposes have been identified, the purposes are clearly
described in the related privacy compliance documentation, including but not limited to Privacy
Impact Assessments (PIAs), System of Records Notices (SORNs), and Privacy Act Statements
provided at the time of collection (e.g., on forms organizations use to collect PII). Further, in order
to avoid unauthorized collections or uses of PII, personnel who handle PII receive training on the
organizational authorities for collecting PII, authorized uses of PII, and on the contents of the
notice. Related controls: AR-2, AR-4, AR-5, DM-1, DM-2, TR-1, TR-2, UL-1, UL-2.
Control Enhancements: None.

________________________________________________________________________________________________
FAMILY: ACCOUNTABILITY, AUDIT, AND RISK MANAGEMENT

This family enhances public confidence through effective controls for governance, monitoring, risk
management, and assessment to demonstrate that organizations are complying with applicable
privacy protection requirements and minimizing overall privacy risk.

AR-1

GOVERNANCE AND PRIVACY PROGRAM
Control: The organization:

a.

Appoints a Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO)
accountable for developing, implementing, and maintaining an organization-wide governance
and privacy program to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations regarding
the collection, use, maintenance, sharing, and disposal of personally identifiable information
(PII) by programs and information systems;

b.

Monitors federal privacy laws and policy for changes that affect the privacy program;

c.

Allocates [Assignment: organization-defined allocation of budget and staffing] sufficient
resources to implement and operate the organization-wide privacy program;

d.

Develops a strategic organizational privacy plan for implementing applicable privacy
controls, policies, and procedures;

e.

Develops, disseminates, and implements operational privacy policies and procedures that
govern the appropriate privacy and security controls for programs, information systems, or
technologies involving PII; and

f.

Updates privacy plan, policies, and procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency,
at least biennially].

The development and implementation of a comprehensive governance and
privacy program demonstrates organizational accountability for and commitment to the protection
of individual privacy. Accountability begins with the appointment of an SAOP/CPO with the
authority, mission, resources, and responsibility to develop and implement a multifaceted privacy
program. The SAOP/CPO, in consultation with legal counsel, information security officials, and
others as appropriate: (i) ensures the development, implementation, and enforcement of privacy
policies and procedures; (ii) defines roles and responsibilities for protecting PII; (iii) determines
the level of information sensitivity with regard to PII holdings; (iv) identifies the laws, regulations,
and internal policies that apply to the PII; (v) monitors privacy best practices; and (vi)
monitors/audits compliance with identified privacy controls.
Supplemental Guidance:

To further accountability, the SAOP/CPO develops privacy plans to document the privacy
requirements of organizations and the privacy and security controls in place or planned for
meeting those requirements. The plan serves as evidence of organizational privacy operations and
supports resource requests by the SAOP/CPO. A single plan or multiple plans may be necessary
depending upon the organizational structures, requirements, and resources, and the plan(s) may
vary in comprehensiveness. For example, a one-page privacy plan may cover privacy policies,
documentation, and controls already in place, such as Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA) and
System of Records Notices (SORN). A comprehensive plan may include a baseline of privacy
controls selected from this appendix and include: (i) processes for conducting privacy risk
assessments; (ii) templates and guidance for completing PIAs and SORNs; (iii) privacy training
and awareness requirements; (iv) requirements for contractors processing PII; (v) plans for
eliminating unnecessary PII holdings; and (vi) a framework for measuring annual performance
goals and objectives for implementing identified privacy controls.

PRIVACY IMPACT AND RISK ASSESSMENT
Control: The organization:

a.

Documents and implements a privacy risk management process that assesses privacy risk to
individuals resulting from the collection, sharing, storing, transmitting, use, and disposal of
personally identifiable information (PII); and

b.

Conducts Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) for information systems, programs, or other
activities that pose a privacy risk in accordance with applicable law, OMB policy, or any
existing organizational policies and procedures.

Organizational privacy risk management processes operate across the life
cycles of all mission/business processes that collect, use, maintain, share, or dispose of PII. The
tools and processes for managing risk are specific to organizational missions and resources. They
include, but are not limited to, the conduct of PIAs. The PIA is both a process and the document
that is the outcome of that process. OMB Memorandum 03-22 provides guidance to organizations
for implementing the privacy provisions of the E-Government Act of 2002, including guidance on
when PIAs are required for information systems. Some organizations may be required by law or
policy to extend the PIA requirement to other activities involving PII or otherwise impacting
privacy (e.g., programs, projects, or regulations). PIAs are conducted to identify privacy risks and
identify methods to mitigate those risks. PIAs are also conducted to ensure that programs or
information systems comply with legal, regulatory, and policy requirements. PIAs also serve as
notice to the public of privacy practices. PIAs are performed before developing or procuring
information systems, or initiating programs or projects, that collect, use, maintain, or share PII and
are updated when changes create new privacy risks.

PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTRACTORS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS
Control: The organization:

a.

Establishes privacy roles, responsibilities, and access requirements for contractors and service
providers; and

b.

Includes privacy requirements in contracts and other acquisition-related documents.

Contractors and service providers include, but are not limited to,
information providers, information processors, and other organizations providing information
system development, information technology services, and other outsourced
applications. Organizations consult with legal counsel, the Senior Agency Official for Privacy
(SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO), and contracting officers about applicable laws, directives,
policies, or regulations that may impact implementation of this control. Related control: AR-1,

PRIVACY MONITORING AND AUDITING
Control: The organization monitors and audits privacy controls and internal privacy policy

[Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to ensure effective implementation.
Supplemental Guidance: To promote accountability, organizations identify and address gaps in

privacy compliance, management, operational, and technical controls by conducting regular
assessments (e.g., internal risk assessments). These assessments can be self-assessments or thirdparty audits that result in reports on compliance gaps identified in programs, projects, and
information systems. In addition to auditing for effective implementation of all privacy controls
identified in this appendix, organizations assess whether they: (i) implement a process to embed
privacy considerations into the life cycle of personally identifiable information (PII), programs,
information systems, mission/business processes, and technology; (ii) monitor for changes to
applicable privacy laws, regulations, and policies; (iii) track programs, information systems, and
applications that collect and maintain PII to ensure compliance; (iv) ensure that access to PII is
only on a need-to-know basis; and (v) ensure that PII is being maintained and used only for the
legally authorized purposes identified in the public notice(s).
Organizations also: (i) implement technology to audit for the security, appropriate use, and loss of
PII; (ii) perform reviews to ensure physical security of documents containing PII; (iii) assess
contractor compliance with privacy requirements; and (iv) ensure that corrective actions identified
as part of the assessment process are tracked and monitored until audit findings are corrected. The
organization Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) coordinates
monitoring and auditing efforts with information security officials and ensures that the results are
provided to senior managers and oversight officials. Related controls: AR-6, AR-7, AU-1, AU-2,

AR-5

PRIVACY AWARENESS AND TRAINING
Control: The organization:

a.

Develops, implements, and updates a comprehensive training and awareness strategy aimed at
ensuring that personnel understand privacy responsibilities and procedures;

b.

Administers basic privacy training [Assignment: organization-defined frequency, at least
annually] and targeted, role-based privacy training for personnel having responsibility for
personally identifiable information (PII) or for activities that involve PII [Assignment:
organization-defined frequency, at least annually]; and

c.

Ensures that personnel certify (manually or electronically) acceptance of responsibilities for
privacy requirements [Assignment: organization-defined frequency, at least annually].

Through implementation of a privacy training and awareness strategy, the
organization promotes a culture of privacy. Privacy training and awareness programs typically
focus on broad topics, such as responsibilities under the Privacy Act of 1974 and E-Government
Act of 2002 and the consequences of failing to carry out those responsibilities, how to identify
new privacy risks, how to mitigate privacy risks, and how and when to report privacy incidents.
Privacy training may also target data collection and use requirements identified in public notices,
such as Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) or System of Records Notices (SORNs) for a program
or information system. Specific training methods may include: (i) mandatory annual privacy
awareness training; (ii) targeted, role-based training; (iii) internal privacy program websites; (iv)
manuals, guides, and handbooks; (v) slide presentations; (vi) events (e.g., privacy awareness week,
privacy clean-up day); (vii) posters and brochures; and (viii) email messages to all employees and
contractors. Organizations update training based on changing statutory, regulatory, mission,

PRIVACY REPORTING
Control: The organization develops, disseminates, and updates reports to the Office of

Management and Budget (OMB), Congress, and other oversight bodies, as appropriate, to
demonstrate accountability with specific statutory and regulatory privacy program mandates, and
to senior management and other personnel with responsibility for monitoring privacy program
progress and compliance.
Supplemental Guidance: Through internal and external privacy reporting, organizations promote

accountability and transparency in organizational privacy operations. Reporting also helps
organizations to determine progress in meeting privacy compliance requirements and privacy
controls, compare performance across the federal government, identify vulnerabilities and gaps in
policy and implementation, and identify success models. Types of privacy reports include: (i)
annual Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP) reports to OMB; (ii) reports to Congress
required by the Implementing Regulations of the 9/11 Commission Act; and (iii) other public
reports required by specific statutory mandates or internal policies of organizations. The
organization Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) consults
with legal counsel, where appropriate, to ensure that organizations meet all applicable privacy
reporting requirements.

PRIVACY-ENHANCED SYSTEM DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
Control: The organization designs information systems to support privacy by automating privacy

controls.
Supplemental Guidance: To the extent feasible, when designing organizational information systems,

organizations employ technologies and system capabilities that automate privacy controls on the
collection, use, retention, and disclosure of personally identifiable information (PII). By building
privacy controls into system design and development, organizations mitigate privacy risks to PII,
thereby reducing the likelihood of information system breaches and other privacy-related
incidents. Organizations also conduct periodic reviews of systems to determine the need for
updates to maintain compliance with the Privacy Act and the organization’s privacy policy.
Regardless of whether automated privacy controls are employed, organizations regularly monitor
information system use and sharing of PII to ensure that the use/sharing is consistent with the
authorized purposes identified in the Privacy Act and/or in the public notice of organizations, or in
a manner compatible with those purposes. Related controls: AC-6, AR-4, AR-5, DM-2, TR-1.

ACCOUNTING OF DISCLOSURES
Control: The organization:

a.

Keeps an accurate accounting of disclosures of information held in each system of records
under its control, including:
(1) Date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure of a record; and
(2) Name and address of the person or agency to which the disclosure was made;

b.

Retains the accounting of disclosures for the life of the record or five years after the
disclosure is made, whichever is longer; and

c.

Makes the accounting of disclosures available to the person named in the record upon request.

Supplemental Guidance: The Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer

(CPO) periodically consults with managers of organization systems of record to ensure that the
required accountings of disclosures of records are being properly maintained and provided to
persons named in those records consistent with the dictates of the Privacy Act. Organizations are
not required to keep an accounting of disclosures when the disclosures are made to individuals
with a need to know, are made pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, or are made to a law
enforcement agency pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552a(c)(3). Heads of agencies can promulgate rules to
exempt certain systems of records from the requirement to provide the accounting of disclosures to
individuals. Related control: IP-2.

FAMILY: DATA QUALITY AND INTEGRITY

This family enhances public confidence that any personally identifiable information (PII) collected
and maintained by organizations is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete for the purpose for which
it is to be used, as specified in public notices.

DI-1

DATA QUALITY
Control: The organization:

a.

Confirms to the greatest extent practicable upon collection or creation of personally
identifiable information (PII), the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness of that
information;

b.

Collects PII directly from the individual to the greatest extent practicable;

c.

Checks for, and corrects as necessary, any inaccurate or outdated PII used by its programs or
systems [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and

d.

Issues guidelines ensuring and maximizing the quality, utility, objectivity, and integrity of
disseminated information.

Supplemental Guidance: Organizations take reasonable steps to confirm the accuracy and relevance

of PII. Such steps may include, for example, editing and validating addresses as they are collected
or entered into information systems using automated address verification look-up application
programming interfaces (API). The types of measures taken to protect data quality are based on
the nature and context of the PII, how it is to be used, and how it was obtained. Measures taken to
validate the accuracy of PII that is used to make determinations about the rights, benefits, or
privileges of individuals under federal programs may be more comprehensive than those used to
validate less sensitive PII. Additional steps may be necessary to validate PII that is obtained from
sources other than individuals or the authorized representatives of individuals.
When PII is of a sufficiently sensitive nature (e.g., when it is used for annual reconfirmation of a
taxpayer’s income for a recurring benefit), organizations incorporate mechanisms into information
systems and develop corresponding procedures for how frequently, and by what method, the
information is to be updated. Related controls: AP-2, DI-2, DM-1, IP-3, SI-10.

Organizations enter into Computer Matching Agreements in connection with computer matching programs to which
they are a party. With certain exceptions, a computer matching program is any computerized comparison of two or
more automated systems of records or a system of records with nonfederal records for the purpose of establishing or
verifying the eligibility of, or continuing compliance with, statutory and regulatory requirements by, applicants for,
recipients or beneficiaries of, participants in, or providers of services with respect to cash or in-kind assistance or
payments under federal benefit programs or computerized comparisons of two or more automated federal personnel or
payroll systems of records or a system of federal personnel or payroll records with nonfederal records. See Computer
Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988, 5 U.S.C. § 552a (a)(8)(A).

FAMILY: DATA MINIMIZATION AND RETENTION

This family helps organizations implement the data minimization and retention requirements to
collect, use, and retain only personally identifiable information (PII) that is relevant and necessary
for the purpose for which it was originally collected. Organizations retain PII for only as long as
necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) specified in public notices and in accordance with a National
Archives and Records Administration (NARA)-approved record retention schedule.

DM-1

MINIMIZATION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
Control: The organization:

a.

Identifies the minimum personally identifiable information (PII) elements that are relevant
and necessary to accomplish the legally authorized purpose of collection;

b.

Limits the collection and retention of PII to the minimum elements identified for the purposes
described in the notice and for which the individual has provided consent; and

c.

Conducts an initial evaluation of PII holdings and establishes and follows a schedule for
regularly reviewing those holdings [Assignment: organization-defined frequency, at least
annually] to ensure that only PII identified in the notice is collected and retained, and that the
PII continues to be necessary to accomplish the legally authorized purpose.

Supplemental Guidance: Organizations take appropriate steps to ensure that the collection of PII is

consistent with a purpose authorized by law or regulation. The minimum set of PII elements
required to support a specific organization business process may be a subset of the PII the
organization is authorized to collect. Program officials consult with the Senior Agency Official for
Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) and legal counsel to identify the minimum PII
elements required by the information system or activity to accomplish the legally authorized
purpose.
Organizations can further reduce their privacy and security risks by also reducing their inventory
of PII, where appropriate. OMB Memorandum 07-16 requires organizations to conduct both an
initial review and subsequent reviews of their holdings of all PII and ensure, to the maximum
extent practicable, that such holdings are accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. Organizations
are also directed by OMB to reduce their holdings to the minimum necessary for the proper
performance of a documented organizational business purpose. OMB Memorandum 07-16
requires organizations to develop and publicize, either through a notice in the Federal Register or
on their websites, a schedule for periodic reviews of their holdings to supplement the initial
review. Organizations coordinate with their federal records officers to ensure that reductions in
organizational holdings of PII are consistent with NARA retention schedules.
By performing periodic evaluations, organizations reduce risk, ensure that they are collecting only
the data specified in the notice, and ensure that the data collected is still relevant and necessary for
the purpose(s) specified in the notice. Related controls: AP-1, AP-2, AR-4, IP-1, SE-1, SI-12, TR1.

MINIMIZATION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION | LOCATE / REMOVE / REDACT / ANONYMIZE PII

The organization, where feasible and within the limits of technology, locates and removes/redacts
specified PII and/or uses anonymization and de-identification techniques to permit use of the
retained information while reducing its sensitivity and reducing the risk resulting from disclosure.
Supplemental Guidance: NIST Special Publication 800-122 provides guidance on

anonymization.

DATA RETENTION AND DISPOSAL
Control: The organization:

a.

Retains each collection of personally identifiable information (PII) for [Assignment:
organization-defined time period] to fulfill the purpose(s) identified in the notice or as
required by law;

b.

Disposes of, destroys, erases, and/or anonymizes the PII, regardless of the method of storage,
in accordance with a NARA-approved record retention schedule and in a manner that prevents
loss, theft, misuse, or unauthorized access; and

c.

Uses [Assignment: organization-defined techniques or methods] to ensure secure deletion or
destruction of PII (including originals, copies, and archived records).

Supplemental Guidance: NARA provides retention schedules that govern the disposition of federal

records. Program officials coordinate with records officers and with NARA to identify appropriate
retention periods and disposal methods. NARA may require organizations to retain PII longer than
is operationally needed. In those situations, organizations describe such requirements in the notice.
Methods of storage include, for example, electronic, optical media, or paper.
Examples of ways organizations may reduce holdings include reducing the types of PII held (e.g.,
delete Social Security numbers if their use is no longer needed) or shortening the retention period
for PII that is maintained if it is no longer necessary to keep PII for long periods of time (this
effort is undertaken in consultation with an organization’s records officer to receive NARA
approval). In both examples, organizations provide notice (e.g., an updated System of Records
Notice) to inform the public of any changes in holdings of PII.
Certain read-only archiving techniques, such as DVDs, CDs, microfilm, or microfiche, may not
permit the removal of individual records without the destruction of the entire database contained
on such media. Related controls: AR-4, AU-11, DM-1, MP-1, MP-2, MP-3, MP-4, MP-5, MP-6,

MINIMIZATION OF PII USED IN TESTING, TRAINING, AND RESEARCH
Control: The organization:

a.

Develops policies and procedures that minimize the use of personally identifiable information
(PII) for testing, training, and research; and

b.

Implements controls to protect PII used for testing, training, and research.

Supplemental Guidance: Organizations often use PII for testing new applications or information

systems prior to deployment. Organizations also use PII for research purposes and for training.
The use of PII in testing, research, and training increases risk of unauthorized disclosure or misuse
of the information. If PII must be used, organizations take measures to minimize any associated
risks and to authorize the use of and limit the amount of PII for these purposes. Organizations
consult with the SAOP/CPO and legal counsel to ensure that the use of PII in testing, training, and
research is compatible with the original purpose for which it was collected.

FAMILY: INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPATION AND REDRESS

This family addresses the need to make individuals active participants in the decision-making process
regarding the collection and use of their personally identifiable information (PII). By providing
individuals with access to PII and the ability to have their PII corrected or amended, as appropriate,
the controls in this family enhance public confidence in organizational decisions made based on the
PII.

IP-1

CONSENT
Control: The organization:

a.

Provides means, where feasible and appropriate, for individuals to authorize the collection,
use, maintaining, and sharing of personally identifiable information (PII) prior to its
collection;

b.

Provides appropriate means for individuals to understand the consequences of decisions to
approve or decline the authorization of the collection, use, dissemination, and retention of PII;

c.

Obtains consent, where feasible and appropriate, from individuals prior to any new uses or
disclosure of previously collected PII; and

d.

Ensures that individuals are aware of and, where feasible, consent to all uses of PII not
initially described in the public notice that was in effect at the time the organization collected
the PII.

Supplemental Guidance: Consent is fundamental to the participation of individuals in the decision-

making process regarding the collection and use of their PII and the use of technologies that may
increase risk to personal privacy. To obtain consent, organizations provide individuals appropriate
notice of the purposes of the PII collection or technology use and a means for individuals to
consent to the activity. Organizations tailor the public notice and consent mechanisms to meet
operational needs. Organizations achieve awareness and consent, for example, through updated
public notices.
Organizations may obtain consent through opt-in, opt-out, or implied consent. Opt-in consent is
the preferred method, but it is not always feasible. Opt-in requires that individuals take affirmative
action to allow organizations to collect or use PII. For example, opt-in consent may require an
individual to click a radio button on a website, or sign a document providing consent. In contrast,
opt-out requires individuals to take action to prevent the new or continued collection or use of
such PII. For example, the Federal Trade Commission’s Do-Not-Call Registry allows individuals
to opt-out of receiving unsolicited telemarketing calls by requesting to be added to a list. Implied
consent is the least preferred method and should be used in limited circumstances. Implied consent
occurs where individuals’ behavior or failure to object indicates agreement with the collection or
use of PII (e.g., by entering and remaining in a building where notice has been posted that security
cameras are in use, the individual implies consent to the video recording). Depending upon the
nature of the program or information system, it may be appropriate to allow individuals to limit
the types of PII they provide and subsequent uses of that PII. Organizational consent mechanisms
include a discussion of the consequences to individuals of failure to provide PII. Consequences
can vary from organization to organization. Related controls: AC-2, AP-1, TR-1, TR-2.
Control Enhancements:

CONSENT | MECHANISMS SUPPORTING ITEMIZED OR TIERED CONSENT

The organization implements mechanisms to support itemized or tiered consent for specific uses
of data.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations can provide, for example, individuals’ itemized choices

as to whether they wish to be contacted for any of a variety of purposes. In this situation,
organizations construct consent mechanisms to ensure that organizational operations comply
with individual choices.

INDIVIDUAL ACCESS
Control: The organization:

a.

Provides individuals the ability to have access to their personally identifiable information
(PII) maintained in its system(s) of records;

b.

Publishes rules and regulations governing how individuals may request access to records
maintained in a Privacy Act system of records;

c.

Publishes access procedures in System of Records Notices (SORNs); and

d.

Adheres to Privacy Act requirements and OMB policies and guidance for the proper
processing of Privacy Act requests.

Supplemental Guidance: Access affords individuals the ability to review PII about them held within

organizational systems of records. Access includes timely, simplified, and inexpensive access to
data. Organizational processes for allowing access to records may differ based on resources, legal
requirements, or other factors. The organization Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief
Privacy Officer (CPO) is responsible for the content of Privacy Act regulations and record request
processing, in consultation with legal counsel. Access to certain types of records may not be
appropriate, however, and heads of agencies may promulgate rules exempting particular systems
from the access provision of the Privacy Act. In addition, individuals are not entitled to access to
information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding. Related controls:

IP-3

REDRESS
Control: The organization:

a.

Provides a process for individuals to have inaccurate personally identifiable information (PII)
maintained by the organization corrected or amended, as appropriate; and

b.

Establishes a process for disseminating corrections or amendments of the PII to other
authorized users of the PII, such as external information-sharing partners and, where feasible
and appropriate, notifies affected individuals that their information has been corrected or
amended.

Supplemental Guidance: Redress supports the ability of individuals to ensure the accuracy of PII

held by organizations. Effective redress processes demonstrate organizational commitment to data
quality especially in those business functions where inaccurate data may result in inappropriate
decisions or denial of benefits and services to individuals. Organizations use discretion in
determining if records are to be corrected or amended, based on the scope of redress requests, the
changes sought, and the impact of the changes. Individuals may appeal an adverse decision and
have incorrect information amended, where appropriate.
To provide effective redress, organizations: (i) provide effective notice of the existence of a PII
collection; (ii) provide plain language explanations of the processes and mechanisms for
requesting access to records; (iii) establish criteria for submitting requests for correction or
amendment; (iv) implement resources to analyze and adjudicate requests; (v) implement means of
correcting or amending data collections; and (vi) review any decisions that may have been the
result of inaccurate information.

Organizational redress processes provide responses to individuals of decisions to deny requests for
correction or amendment, including the reasons for those decisions, a means to record individual
objections to the organizational decisions, and a means of requesting organizational reviews of the
initial determinations. Where PII is corrected or amended, organizations take steps to ensure that
all authorized recipients of that PII are informed of the corrected or amended information. In
instances where redress involves information obtained from other organizations, redress processes
include coordination with organizations that originally collected the information. Related controls:

COMPLAINT MANAGEMENT
Control: The organization implements a process for receiving and responding to complaints,

concerns, or questions from individuals about the organizational privacy practices.
Supplemental Guidance: Complaints, concerns, and questions from individuals can serve as a

valuable source of external input that ultimately improves operational models, uses of technology,
data collection practices, and privacy and security safeguards. Organizations provide complaint
mechanisms that are readily accessible by the public, include all information necessary for
successfully filing complaints (including contact information for the Senior Agency Official for
Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) or other official designated to receive complaints),
and are easy to use. Organizational complaint management processes include tracking mechanisms
to ensure that all complaints received are reviewed and appropriately addressed in a timely
manner. Related controls: AR-6, IP-3.

FAMILY: SECURITY

This family supplements the security controls in Appendix F to ensure that technical, physical, and
administrative safeguards are in place to protect personally identifiable information (PII) collected or
maintained by organizations against loss, unauthorized access, or disclosure, and to ensure that
planning and responses to privacy incidents comply with OMB policies and guidance. The controls
in this family are implemented in coordination with information security personnel and in accordance
with the existing NIST Risk Management Framework.

SE-1

INVENTORY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION
Control: The organization:

a.

Establishes, maintains, and updates [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] an
inventory that contains a listing of all programs and information systems identified as
collecting, using, maintaining, or sharing personally identifiable information (PII); and

b.

Provides each update of the PII inventory to the CIO or information security official
[Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to support the establishment of information
security requirements for all new or modified information systems containing PII.

Supplemental Guidance: The PII inventory enables organizations to implement effective

administrative, technical, and physical security policies and procedures to protect PII consistent
with Appendix F, and to mitigate risks of PII exposure. As one method of gathering information
for their PII inventories, organizations may extract the following information elements from
Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA) for information systems containing PII: (i) the name and
acronym for each system identified; (ii) the types of PII contained in that system; (iii)
classification of level of sensitivity of all types of PII, as combined in that information system; and
(iv) classification of level of potential risk of substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or
unfairness to affected individuals, as well as the financial or reputational risks to organizations, if
PII is exposed. Organizations take due care in updating the inventories by identifying linkable data
that could create PII. Related controls: AR-1, AR-4, AR-5, AT-1, DM-1, PM-5.

PRIVACY INCIDENT RESPONSE
Control: The organization:

a.

Develops and implements a Privacy Incident Response Plan; and

b.

Provides an organized and effective response to privacy incidents in accordance with the
organizational Privacy Incident Response Plan.

Supplemental Guidance: In contrast to the Incident Response (IR) family in Appendix F, which

concerns a broader range of incidents affecting information security, this control uses the term
Privacy Incident to describe only those incidents that relate to personally identifiable information
(PII). The organization Privacy Incident Response Plan is developed under the leadership of the
SAOP/CPO. The plan includes: (i) the establishment of a cross-functional Privacy Incident
Response Team that reviews, approves, and participates in the execution of the Privacy Incident
Response Plan; (ii) a process to determine whether notice to oversight organizations or affected
individuals is appropriate and to provide that notice accordingly; (iii) a privacy risk assessment
process to determine the extent of harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to affected
individuals and, where appropriate, to take steps to mitigate any such risks; (iv) internal

FAMILY: TRANSPARENCY

This family ensures that organizations provide public notice of their information practices and the
privacy impact of their programs and activities.

TR-1

PRIVACY NOTICE
Control: The organization:

a.

Provides effective notice to the public and to individuals regarding: (i) its activities that
impact privacy, including its collection, use, sharing, safeguarding, maintenance, and disposal
of personally identifiable information (PII); (ii) authority for collecting PII; (iii) the choices, if
any, individuals may have regarding how the organization uses PII and the consequences of
exercising or not exercising those choices; and (iv) the ability to access and have PII amended
or corrected if necessary;

b.

Describes: (i) the PII the organization collects and the purpose(s) for which it collects that
information; (ii) how the organization uses PII internally; (iii) whether the organization shares
PII with external entities, the categories of those entities, and the purposes for such sharing;
(iv) whether individuals have the ability to consent to specific uses or sharing of PII and how
to exercise any such consent; (v) how individuals may obtain access to PII; and (vi) how the
PII will be protected; and

c.

Revises its public notices to reflect changes in practice or policy that affect PII or changes in
its activities that impact privacy, before or as soon as practicable after the change.

Supplemental Guidance: Effective notice, by virtue of its clarity, readability, and comprehensiveness,

enables individuals to understand how an organization uses PII generally and, where appropriate,
to make an informed decision prior to providing PII to an organization. Effective notice also
demonstrates the privacy considerations that the organization has addressed in implementing its
information practices. The organization may provide general public notice through a variety of
means, as required by law or policy, including System of Records Notices (SORNs), Privacy
Impact Assessments (PIAs), or in a website privacy policy. As required by the Privacy Act, the
organization also provides direct notice to individuals via Privacy Act Statements on the paper and
electronic forms it uses to collect PII, or on separate forms that can be retained by the individuals.
The organization Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) is
responsible for the content of the organization’s public notices, in consultation with legal counsel
and relevant program managers. The public notice requirement in this control is satisfied by an
organization’s compliance with the public notice provisions of the Privacy Act, the E-Government
Act’s PIA requirement, with OMB guidance related to federal agency privacy notices, and, where
applicable, with policy pertaining to participation in the Information Sharing Environment
(ISE). 124 Changing PII practice or policy without prior notice is disfavored and should only be
undertaken in consultation with the SAOP/CPO and counsel. Related controls: AP-1, AP-2, AR-1,
AR-2, IP-1, IP-2, IP-3, UL-1, UL-2.

PRIVACY NOTICE | REAL-TIME OR LAYERED NOTICE
The organization provides real-time and/or layered notice when it collects PII.

Supplemental Guidance: Real-time notice is defined as notice at the point of collection. A

layered notice approach involves providing individuals with a summary of key points in the
organization’s privacy policy. A second notice provides more detailed/specific information.
124

The Information Sharing Environment is an approach that facilitates the sharing of terrorism and homeland security
information. The ISE was established by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, Public Law
108-458, 118 Stat. 3638. See the ISE website at: http://www.ise.gov.

Supplemental Guidance: Organizations issue SORNs to provide the public notice regarding PII

collected in a system of records, which the Privacy Act defines as “a group of any records under
the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of an individual or by
some identifying number, symbol, or other identifier.” SORNs explain how the information is
used, retained, and may be corrected, and whether certain portions of the system are subject to
Privacy Act exemptions for law enforcement or national security reasons. Privacy Act Statements
provide notice of: (i) the authority of organizations to collect PII; (ii) whether providing PII is
mandatory or optional; (iii) the principal purpose(s) for which the PII is to be used; (iv) the
intended disclosures (routine uses) of the information; and (v) the consequences of not providing
all or some portion of the information requested. When information is collected verbally,
organizations read a Privacy Act Statement prior to initiating the collection of PII (for example,
when conducting telephone interviews or surveys). Related control: DI-2.

authorized purpose(s) identified in the Privacy Act and/or in public notices.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations take steps to ensure that they use PII only for legally

authorized purposes and in a manner compatible with uses identified in the Privacy Act and/or in
public notices. These steps include monitoring and auditing organizational use of PII and training
organizational personnel on the authorized uses of PII. With guidance from the Senior Agency
Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) and where appropriate, legal counsel,
organizations document processes and procedures for evaluating any proposed new uses of PII to
assess whether they fall within the scope of the organizational authorities. Where appropriate,

Control: The organization:

a.

Shares personally identifiable information (PII) externally, only for the authorized purposes
identified in the Privacy Act and/or described in its notice(s) or for a purpose that is
compatible with those purposes;

b.

Where appropriate, enters into Memoranda of Understanding, Memoranda of Agreement,
Letters of Intent, Computer Matching Agreements, or similar agreements, with third parties
that specifically describe the PII covered and specifically enumerate the purposes for which
the PII may be used;

c.

Monitors, audits, and trains its staff on the authorized sharing of PII with third parties and on
the consequences of unauthorized use or sharing of PII; and

d.

Evaluates any proposed new instances of sharing PII with third parties to assess whether the
sharing is authorized and whether additional or new public notice is required.

Supplemental Guidance: The organization Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief

Privacy Officer (CPO) and, where appropriate, legal counsel review and approve any proposed
external sharing of PII, including with other public, international, or private sector entities, for
consistency with uses described in the existing organizational public notice(s). When a proposed
new instance of external sharing of PII is not currently authorized by the Privacy Act and/or
specified in a notice, organizations evaluate whether the proposed external sharing is compatible
with the purpose(s) specified in the notice. If the proposed sharing is compatible, organizations
review, update, and republish their Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs), System of Records
Notices (SORNs), website privacy policies, and other public notices, if any, to include specific
descriptions of the new uses(s) and obtain consent where appropriate and feasible. Informationsharing agreements also include security protections consistent with the sensitivity of the
information being shared. Related controls: AR-3, AR-4, AR-5, AR-8, AP-2, DI-1, DI-2, IP-1,
