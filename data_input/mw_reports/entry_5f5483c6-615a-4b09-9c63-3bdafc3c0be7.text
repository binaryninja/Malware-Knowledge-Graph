1/9

Yesterday, the Cofense Intelligence team released the following guidance via a flash alert to Cofense Intelligence
customers.
On October 28, media reports and U.S. government notifications emerged regarding an active “credible” Ryuk
ransomware threat targeting the U.S. healthcare and public health sector, with plans of a coordinated attack
October 29. This was reportedly based on chatter observed in an online forum that allegedly included members
of the group behind Ryuk. Cofense Intelligence is conducting an ongoing investigation into this threat. While we
can’t evaluate the government’s determination of this threat as credible, we are taking this very seriously and
have observed increased activity against the healthcare sector. We assess with high confidence that
BazarBackdoor is the primary delivery mechanism currently used for Ryuk operations. Moreover, we’ve identified
that similar phishing campaigns used to establish a foothold for Ryuk infections have targeted other sectors, as
well.

BazarBackdoor: Ryuk’s Inroad
Cofense Intelligence assesses that Ryuk operators typically wait until their preferred delivery mechanism is
successfully deployed to an intended target prior to deploying Ryuk ransomware itself. Up until TrickBot’s
disruption, Ryuk was most frequently delivered via TrickBot. However, our analysis indicates that the group
behind Ryuk began leveraging BazarBackdoor to establish access to target systems in September. This aligns
closely with announcements that U.S. Cyber Command had taken action to disrupt TrickBot operations. In recent
weeks, we assess with high confidence that BazarBackdoor has been Ryuk’s most predominant loader. With
lower confidence, we assess this wave of Ryuk activity may be, in part, in retaliation for September’s TrickBot
disruptions.
BazarBackdoor is a stealthy malware downloader that we assess is used by the same group as TrickBot.
Typically, emails designed to appear as internal business communications are sent to victims within an
organization, often with relevant employee names or positions. These emails usually contain a link, most often to
a Google Docs page, though other well-known file hosting platforms have also been used. The Google Docs
page will then present a convincing image with another embedded link. This link is typically to a malicious
executable hosted on a trusted platform such as Amazon AWS. This chain of legitimate services makes it difficult
to detect and stop these campaigns.

2/9

Once in place on a victim’s computer, BazarBackdoor uses specialized network communications to avoid
detection and to contact its command and control (C2) locations. Part of these communications involve DNS
lookups for .bazar domains, which is the reason behind its Bazar name. These C2 locations also often serve as
payload locations. After BazarBackdoor contacts its C2 center it will then collect additional information which the
threat actors can use to deliver customized reconnaissance tools, such as Cobalt Strike payloads. The threat
actors can also choose to deliver other payloads such as Ryuk ransomware. The deployment of Ryuk
ransomware isn’t automated, and therefore won’t occur unless the threat actors decide the infected environment
is a target.
All of us should pay special heed to any indications of BazarBackdoor compromise. Regardless of whether recent
activity is in retaliation against TrickBot’s disruption, what is clear is that recent efforts by multiple parties to
cripple TrickBot seem to have been effective in transitioning the Ryuk actors to leveraging BazarBackdoor. We
must be mindful that there are past connections between TrickBot activity and Emotet. While there is no direct
evidence of current Emotet involvement in these campaigns, we cannot rule out future delivery of Ryuk via
Emotet, given historical relationships between TrickBot and Emotet. As the TrickBot infrastructure appears to be
in the process of restructuring, we assess that it may find use again as a delivery mechanism. As a network
defender, all three malware families should be prioritized when searching for possible compromises, with the
highest priority placed on detections of BazarBackdoor in the near future.

The Phish
Cofense Intelligence has directly identified several campaigns, targeting multiple sectors across our customer
base, that share strong similarities to the phishing emails reportedly used as initial attack vectors in Ryuk
campaigns, as outlined by FireEye. Two subject themes stand out across several industry verticals we’ve
confirmed were targets of BazarBackdoor. These subjects relate A) to employment termination, almost always
including the word “termination,” or B) to payroll, almost always including the word “debit,” as shown in Figure 1.
While the subjects remain the same, we observed two separate download services: via Google Docs or Constant
Contact. The following list highlights the different industries we have confirmed were targeted by such campaigns.
However, we cannot assess whether Ryuk operators intended to further infect these targets with Ryuk
ransomware. It appears very likely that Ryuk operators have cast a wide net for potential infection vectors, and
choose which successful footholds to manually interact with and leverage.

It is worth noting that these campaigns began in mid-September, which corresponds with the timing of
coordinated offensive operations to disrupt TrickBot. The sectors we have directly observed targeted in these
campaigns include:
Consumer Goods
Healthcare
Mining
Energy
Insurance
Professional Services
Financial Services
Manufacturing
Retail

Assessing the Threat
As of early this morning, on October 30, there are reports of some ransomware attacks against U.S. healthcare
organizations yesterday. It is possible more reports will emerge in the coming days, though initial indications
suggest a healthcare sector doomsday was avoided. In recent weeks, there was an abundance of ransomware
activity against the healthcare sector, and we identified an increase in BazarBackdoor targeting. It’s not for us to
say whether the stated time or scope of the threat was off base, if there have been active successful
countermeasures, or that the flurry of reporting has deterred some ransomware activity for now. It is possible they
did/do not want to face such a well-guarded and prepared target base. Still, we are confident that Ryuk
operations have recently increased, and that other sectors have come into the crosshairs of potential future Ryuk
operations. It’s our assessment that the threat should be taken seriously.
Cofense Intelligence customers have received relevant indicators of compromise (IOCs) and Active Threat
Reports (ATRs) as these campaigns are identified and analyzed, and some of these ATRs were first sent in
September. Customers can find these ATRs and IOCs in ThreatHQ and via our API, and can access the most up
to date list of all relevant Cofense Intelligence IOCs and ATRs tied to BazarBackdoor, TrickBot and Emotet via
our API and on ThreatHQ.
