The ASEC analysis team has recently discovered the distribution of Paradise ransomware.
The threat actors are suspected to be utilizing a vulnerability exploitation of the Chinese
remote control program AweSun. In the past, the team also found and covered the
distribution of Sliver C2 and BYOVD through a Sunlogin vulnerability, a remote control
program developed in China.

1. AweSun Vulnerability Exploitation
The installation of Sliver C2 through the AweSun remote control program developed by
AweRay was also discovered to have been carried out by threat actors while the team was
monitoring Sliver C2 attack cases. [1]

Detailed information about the AweSun vulnerability exploitation has yet to be confirmed.
However, considering that this is the same threat actor that exploited the Sunlogin
vulnerability and the fact that Sliver C2 was installed by a PowerShell that was generated by
a child process of AweSun, we can speculate that this attack was also a vulnerability
exploitation. Compared to the latest version of AweSun.exe which now exceeds v2.0, the
AweSun used for the attacks were v1.5 and v1.6, versions that were released several years
ago.
Additionally, we can confirm through the command used in the attack that the attack
command includes a ping that’s similar to the PoC used in the Sunlogin vulnerability.
Although it is currently impossible to download anything from this address, we can infer from
the URL format that it is a command that installs Cobalt Strike.

It appears that the threat attacker is using the AweSun vulnerability exploitation at the same
time as the Sunlogin vulnerability exploitation. The Sliver and BYOVD malware mentioned
above have been found in both vulnerability exploitation cases along with a XMRig
CoinMiner.
This post will focus on the Paradise attack case since it was the most recent case of this
vulnerability exploitation. The following is AhnLab’s ASD (AhnLab Smart Defense) log, which
shows that the Paradise ransomware, “DP_Main.exe,” was installed by the cmd and
PowerShell generated by AweSun.

2. Analysis of Paradise Ransomware
Paradise, which is installed through an AweSun vulnerability exploitation, was first
discovered in 2017 as a RaaS (Ransomware as a Service) type ransomware developed in
.NET. [2]

Paradise utilizes various configuration files. After the completion of the encryption process,
the “%APPDATA%DP\welldone.dp” file is generated. If the file already exists, the encryption
stage is skipped and the ransom note is shown. Paradise will restart with admin privilege if it
is executed without the authority as the ransomware uses it to encrypt the system; at this
stage the “%APPDATA%DP\RunAsAdmin.dp” file is used. PCID is the value that represents
the infected system and is saved in the “id.dp” file that is generated on the current path. The
value is also used later for the ransom note and sending the infection information to the C&C
server.

Table 2. Settings file
Paradise generates a 1024-bit RSA key and uses it to encrypt files. The ransomware
encrypts the RSA private key necessary for file decryption by using the threat actor’s master
RSA public key that’s saved in the settings data.

Figure 6. Settings file where the master RSA public key is saved
Among the settings files, “DecryptionInfo.auth” has a RSA private key that has been
encrypted by the generated RSA public key and the threat actor’s master RSA public key.

Figure 7. DecryptionInfo.auth file
The paths excluded from encryption are based on folder paths, so “windows”, “firefox”,
“chrome”, “google”, “opera” and “%APPDATA%\DP\.”. This means that all paths are targeted
excluding the settings paths. A distinct characteristic of Paradise is the fact that it sets the
“mysql,” “firebird,” “mssql,” “microsoft sql,” and “backup” paths as high priority encryption
targets.

Furthermore, this ransomware can create a copy of itself in %APPDATA%DP\DP_Main.exe
and register it to the run key or delete the volume shadow service using the following
command.
“cmd.exe” /C sc delete VSS

After the encryption process is finished, Paradise transfers basic information like the PCID
and computer name along with information such as the number of encrypted files and the
time it took to finish encryption to the C&C server.

ransomware. The note includes an email address and Bitcoin wallet address as means of
contact.

3. Conclusion
We have found recent cases where various ransomware, including Paradise, were installed
on vulnerable software that did not have recent patches applied. Therefore, users must
update their installed software to the latest version to preemptively prevent vulnerability
exploitations. Also, V3 should be updated to the latest version so that malware infection can
be prevented.
