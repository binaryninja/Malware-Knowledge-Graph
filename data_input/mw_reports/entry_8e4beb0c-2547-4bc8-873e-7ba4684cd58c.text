Emotet Returns, Now Adopts Binary Padding for Evasion

Overview
Following a three-month hiatus, Emotet spam activities resumed in March 2023, when a
botnet known as Epoch 4 began delivering malicious documents embedded in Zip files that
were attached to the emails.
We have been tracking the threat actor’s efforts to deploy new command-and-control (C&C)
infrastructure, where we detected activity spikes in January and February.

Infection chain

The threat actors behind Emotet continue to use malicious documents containing macros to
deliver the malicious payload. Note that while Microsoft disabled macros from the internet by
default in 2022, the document template employs social engineering techniques to trick users
into enabling macros to allow the attack to proceed as intended.
The threat actors behind these emails have adopted the use of binary padding as an evasion
technique, where both the dropper document and the Emotet DLL files are inflated to 500+
megabytes to avoid security solutions. Other similar defense evasion techniques have
previously been observed being used by other malicious actors.

Once a user enables macros for the malicious document, it will download a ZIP file will from
one of seven hardcoded and obfuscated URLs (which will be iterated through until the file is
successfully retrieved):

The macro will then check if the response is 200 (indicating a success retrieval of the file). If
so, it will then check if that file is either a PE File or a Zip file, suggesting that the threat
actors may adopt alternative file formats to Zip files containing binary padded PE files.
The macro uses a function that checks the file type of the downloaded payload by examining
the first two bytes of the file. It first checks if the first two bytes are equal to the ASCII values
of "M" and "Z" (77 and 90, respectively). If so, it returns a value of 1, indicating that the file is
a PE file. On the other hand, if the first two bytes are not equal to "M" and "Z," the function
checks if they are equal to the ASCII values of "P" and "K" (80 and 75, respectively). If so, it
returns a value of 2, indicating that the file is a Zip file.
The CopyHere() method of the Shell32.FolderItems object is then used to extract the
contents of the Zip file to the destination folder, after which the macro deletes the temporary
folder files.
Finally, regsvr32.exe is invoked and the DLL is loaded with the /s switch to silently execute
the Emotet payload to infect the endpoint.

Stealer and spam routines
For its stealer and spam routines, Emotet will make a copy of certutil.exe (a legitimate
command-line tool) in the temporary directory that starts in a suspended state and then
hollowed out.
The malware will then load one of several modules such as NirSoft's Web Browser PassView
and Mail PassView tools, an Outlook stealer, and a spam module before resuming execution.
Note that we have not observed any second stage payloads outside of Emotet’s stealer and
the spam modules. However, it is possible that payloads (such as backdoors and/or other
information stealers) might be dropped in the future to enable access for other threat actors.

Evasion techniques
Binary padding is used to inflate file sizes so that they exceed the size limitations imposed by
anti-malware solutions such as sandboxes and scan engines. In this example, the Emotet
DLL is padded with 00 bytes in the overlay, inflating the PE file from 616KB to 548.1MB.
For Emotet, both the dropper document and the PE files use the 00-byte padding technique
to inflate the file size. Malicious actors use Zip compression to transport the relatively small
files via email and HTTP, before decompression is used to inflate the files to evade security
solutions.
Finally, reconnaissance activities are performed either via IP configs or through the affected
machine’s system information.

Conclusion and recommendations
Emotet has been a prolific and resilient threat, even surviving a takedown of its infrastructure
in 2021. Given what we’ve seen of Emotet over the years, it would not be surprising to see it
evolve further in future attacks, employing alternative malware delivery methods, adopting
new evasion techniques, and integrating additional second and even third-stage payloads
into its routines.
To avoid getting infected by malicious spam emails, users should be cautious of emails from
unknown senders or with suspicious subject lines. These types of emails are often paired
with social engineering techniques that are designed to get recipients to click on a link or
download an attachment containing malware. Users should also ensure that macros are
disabled in Microsoft Office applications and avoid enabling them even when even prompted.
Using spam filters can also help automatically filter out suspicious or unwanted emails before
they reach the user’s inbox. By following these precautions, both individual users and
organizations can greatly reduce the risk of getting infected by malicious spam emails.
Endpoint solutions like Trend Micro's Smart Protection Suites and Worry-Free Business
Security solutions offer protection for both users and businesses against threats like Emotet.
These solutions come equipped with behavior-monitoring capabilities that enable them to
detect malicious files, scripts, and messages. They can also block all related malicious
URLs. Additionally, the Trend Micro™ Deep Discovery™ solution includes an email
inspection layer that can identify and protect enterprises from malicious attachments and
URLs. By leveraging these powerful tools, users and businesses can effectively defend
themselves against the damaging effects of Emotet and other similar threats.
