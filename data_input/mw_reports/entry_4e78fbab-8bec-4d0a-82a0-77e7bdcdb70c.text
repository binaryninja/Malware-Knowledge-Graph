We’ve uncovered some new data and likely attribution regarding a series of APT watering
hole attacks this past summer. Watering hole attacks are an increasingly popular component
of APT campaigns, as many people are more aware of spear phishing and are less likely to
open documents or click on links in unsolicited emails. Watering hole attacks offer a much
better chance of success because they involve compromising legitimate websites and
installing malware intended to compromise website visitors. These are often popular
websites frequented by people who work in specific industries or have political sympathies to
which the actors want to gain access.
The attacks discussed in this blog are related to an APT campaign commonly referred to as
“th3bug”, named for the password the actors often use with their Poison Ivy malware. Of
note, only the older of the samples we cover in this blog used that password. We don’t know
the reason the actors changed this, but it could possibly be in reaction to information widely
published on the Internet about their activities, which use that password as a key component
to tie the activity together. FireEye in particular published a paper describing several APT
campaigns whose activity they correlate using Poison Ivy passwords.
In contrast to many other APT campaigns, which tend to rely heavily on spear phishing to
gain victims, “th3bug” is known for compromising legitimate websites their intended visitors
are likely to frequent. Over the summer they compromised several sites, including a wellknown Uyghur website written in that native language.
While we were unable to recover the initial vulnerability used, it is possibly the same CVE
2014-0515 Adobe Flash exploit first reported by Cisco TRAC in late July. We cannot confirm
the initial compromised sites, but we noted traffic to several known re-direct sites and the
malware was configured to use the same command and control (C2) server.

In addition, the download dates of many of our files pre-date those noted by Cisco by only a
few days. All of the malware were variants of the Poison Ivy Remote Administration Tool
(RAT) and were properly identified as such by our WildFire platform. The targets of the
attack were:
Uyghur sympathizers
An East Asian office for a major US based computer manufacturer
A major US university
An international wholesale and retail telecom provider
We saw the first sample on July 14, 2014. This sample had an interesting PDB string - C:
\Users\sophie\documents\visual studio 2010\Projects\init\Release\init.pdb with a time date
string that exactly matched the PE timestamp of 11 July, 2014.

The next day we collected several copies of the same malware intended for the same
industry. They were downloaded from one of the download URLs in the below table, but all
had the same MD5 and C2 domain.

On July 16 WildFire picked up a malicious executable hosted on uyghurweb.net, a legitimate
Uyghur website that was compromised to infect users. The file was named “PYvBte.jar” but
was actually a Windows executable. The file has the characteristics listed in Table 3, and
appears to be a stand-alone executable version of the Metasploit Meterpreter shell. When
this file runs, it downloads a payload from uyghurweb.net/player/gmuweb.exe and executes
it. This file is the same Poison Ivy RAT described in Table 2.
The Meterpreter payload masquerades as a copy of the ApacheBench tool made by the
Apache Software Foundation.

On 21 July, we detected another sample that was noted in the Cisco TRAC blog. The initial
download URL and IP resolution were different than the previous samples, but the C2
domain and resolution matched. This file is also a Poison Ivy variant.

Based on historical IP resolution overlaps between the above C2 domains and other
domains that have also resolved to the same IPs, we found an additional sample from the
beginning of this year.
Interestingly, the first sample was not logged in VirusTotal prior to our submission, despite
the sample having been in use in the wild for at least seven months. In addition, it is the only
sample tied to this activity we found that used the Poison Ivy password “th3bug”. AVAST
wrote a blog related to the activity we describe here and tied a file with the same name, but
the sample we found doesn’t match any other details of the file they documented.

4/6

Also of note, the IP resolution for this C2 domain was changed to match the IP resolution of
the C2 domains used in the July activity only a few days after these samples were seen.
Additionally, the files PE timestamp was January 21, the day before we detected the sample.
Targeted industries for this series are listed below.
Another international wholesale and retail telecom provider
A major visual computing company headquartered in the US
A state-owned East Asian financial services company

Watering hole attacks will continue to be popular with APT campaigns, as they are much
harder to defend against then spear phishing attacks. There is no way for people browsing to
these websites to know in advance the normally trusted website has been compromised and
will serve them malware when they visit it.
Ensuring web browsers and operating system software is fully patched and up-to-date is the
best way to defend against this type of threat. However, to increase success rates APT
campaigns can use zero-day exploits, so even a properly patched system would be
compromised. Palo Alto Networks users should use our firewall’s ability to block executable
downloads unless the user specifically authorizes it. If you want to allow executables through
but prefer that they be analyzed for malicious activity, use our WildFire platform, which
correctly identified all of the files listed in this blog as malware and provides users with a full
report on the samples host and network-based activities.
