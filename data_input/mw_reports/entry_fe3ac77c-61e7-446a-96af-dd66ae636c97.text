The Many Faces of Emotet

You’ve probably heard the recent news of Microsoft’s attempt to take down the Trickbot
botnet. An interesting correlation with this event (though perhaps not directly related..) is the
sudden uptick of Emotet email spam shortly after the Microsoft news hit. Emotet has the
functionality to drop other strains of malware on machines that it compromises, and lately
Trickbot has been one of the main ones dropped by Emotet. Perhaps these actors are flexing
that Microsoft’s attempts did nothing; or perhaps they fear this is only the beginning of botnet
take downs and are increasing their efforts before they are fully taken down.
A recent bleeping computer article mentions a new malicious document template that is
pretending to be a ‘Windows Update’. It uses this to try to trick people into essentially
‘enabling macros’, which allows the successful execution of the Emotet malware.
However, it is odd that this is the approach in helping people avoid infection. You should not
be getting to the point where you download a suspicious attachment, execute it, and see the
fake Windows Update document asking you to Enable Editing/Enable Content. Although
there are many different iterations of Emotet, there does appear to be a set of characteristics
that all Emotet spam share to some degree. This article will be going over the most recent
email spam templates we’ve seen from Emotet so that you can identify the spam without
downloading and executing a malware file.

Emotet Spam Templates
We’ve broken down the latest Emotet spam campaign into pieces that anyone can
understand and identify. A few months back we wrote a similar article on how to spot Emotet;
this article will have more relevant information on current Emotet trends. Although Emotet
has been shown to consistently change email templates, usually it is only enough to bypass
spam filters and will still retain a familiar Emotet ‘feel’. Emotet spam will not always contain
all the characteristics which we will describe below, but we can be sure at least a subset will
be present.

1. Emotet’s Payload is either an Attachment or Link

1/4

The redacted sections are mostly going to be domain of the recipient, or a ‘spoofed’ sender.
Emotet loves to make you think the email is from somebody you know, or that knows you.
Fairly straightforward, the two ways the malware file will reach your computer will be via
attachment or link. The .doc attachment is likely to be identified and blocked by common
email antivirus scanners. The password protected zip file is the actors’ method of evading
these antivirus scans. With regards to links, in the current campaign we are noticing that the
‘real’ URL when you hover over the link is different than what the link represents. This ‘fake’
link method is commonly used by spammers to trick people into believing they are clicking a
familiar link. Always check where the link goes, either by hovering over it or right clicking and
copying the link’s location to paste somewhere (but not into your browser!).

2. Emotet may Pretend to be part of an Existing Thread

Emotet spam may pretend to be part of an already existing conversation with you. You might
recognize the ‘—-Original Message—-‘ line of the email, as it is a common method for
Emotet to add this section. Emotet may also just copy and paste a real email reply chain that
you might have had with someone in the past (third example in the above picture).

2/4

Emotet also likes to create a fake ‘Reply’ or ‘Forward’ message by adding that to the
beginning of the Subject line. If you have more expertise with email headers, you’ll be able to
see why these are not genuine Reply or Forward email chains.
The Emotet malware has many capabilities, and one of them is data exfiltration. When
Emotet compromises a computer, it has been seen to steal data such as your email address
and name, your email contact list, and emails in your ‘Sent’ folder. With this data, these
actors will eventually send spam (using a different compromised machine) with your name in
the ‘From’, delivering malware to people on your contact list. This leads to our next point…

3. Emotet may send an Email where the From:Name appears to be Someone
you know

Emotet will sometimes ‘spoof’ the ‘From name’ (the name of the sender in the From line, not
to be confused with the ‘domain’ or ’email address’ portion of the From line). Typically the
name that is spoofed will be the name of someone whose machine was previously infected
with the Emotet malware. It is likely that you will recognize this name, or have engaged in
email communication with this person some time in the past. The first example of the above
picture shows that sometimes the whole email address will be in the ‘From name’ (disguised
as the address by putting brackets <> around it). Many mobile applications for email will only
show you the ‘From name’ portion, hiding the actual email address. This method can

3/4

potentially trick people into thinking they have received an email from someone they know,
when in reality the actual sender is a different email address. It is a big red flag if you see two
<email1@address><email2@address> in the From line of your email.

4. The latest Trend is that the Subject will contain the Recipient’s Domain
This particular trend will very likely change if it hasn’t already. We have seen a variety of
different subject patterns such as Coronavirus News or Fake Invoices. The latest wave of
Emotet spam has the ‘To name’ portion copied into the Subject line.

Concluding Remarks
A typical Emotet spam message will always have either an attachment or link. Afterwards, it
will have some combination of the characteristics described in this article. However, be
warned that there will be some cases with very little identifying characteristics, as seen
below.

Remain vigilant, and keep up to date with the latest Emotet trends in order to avoid getting
compromised!
