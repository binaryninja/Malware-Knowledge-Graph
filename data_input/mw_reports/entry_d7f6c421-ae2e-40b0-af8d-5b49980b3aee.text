We observe a new trend on the ransomware scene – intermittent encryption, or partial
encryption of victims’ files. This encryption method helps ransomware operators to evade
detection systems and encrypt victims’ files faster. We observe that ransomware developers
are increasingly adopting the feature and intensively advertising intermittent encryption to
attract buyers or affiliates.
Intermittent encryption is important to ransomware operators from two perspectives:
Speed: Encryption can be a time-intensive process and time is crucial to ransomware
operators – the faster they encrypt the victims’ files, the less likely they are to be
detected and stopped in the process. Intermittent encryption does irretrievable damage
in a very short time frame.

Evasion: Ransomware detection systems may use statistical analysis to detect
ransomware operation. Such an analysis may evaluate the intensity of file IO
operations or the similarity between a known version of a file, which has not been
affected by ransomware, and a suspected modified, encrypted version of the file. In
contrast to full encryption, intermittent encryption helps to evade such analyses by
exhibiting a significantly lower intensity of file IO operations and much higher similarity
between non-encrypted and encrypted versions of a given file.
In mid-2021, the LockFile ransomware was one of the first major ransomware families to use
intermittent encryption for evading detection mechanisms, encrypting every other 16 bytes of
a file. Since then an increasing number of ransomware operations have joined the trend.
In this post, we review several recent ransomware families that feature intermittent
encryption in an attempt to evade detection and prevention: Qyick, Agenda, BlackCat
(ALPHV), PLAY, and Black Basta.

Qyick Ransomware
At the end of August 2022, we observed a user named lucrostm advertising a new
commercial ransomware called Qyick in a popular TOR-based crime forum. We track the
same user as an established vendor of other malicious tools including remote access tools
and malware loaders.
The Qyick ransomware offering is a one-time purchase, as opposed to the more common
subscription model. The price ranges from .2 BTC to approximately 1.5 BTC, depending on
the level of customization the buyer requires. The buyer receives a compiled executable with
a guarantee: if the ransomware is detected by security software within 6 months of purchase,
the author will provide a new sample with a discount between 60% and 80% of the original
price.
Qyick is written in Go and features intermittent encryption. lucrostm claims the apparent
speed of the Qyick ransomware is achieved through the use of intermittent encryption and
the ransomware’s implementation in Go, hinting at the current trend of intermittent encryption
in the ransomware threat scene.
“Notably Qyick features intermittent encryption which is what the cool kids are using as you
read this. Combined with the fact that is written in go, the speed is unmatched.”

Qyick ransomware advertisement
The exact manner in which Qyick conducts intermittent encryption is open to investigation as
samples become available.
The current version of Qyick does not have data exfiltration capabilities. However, lucrostm
has announced that future versions will feature execution of arbitrary executable code,
meant primarily for the execution of data exfiltration capabilities.

Agenda Ransomware
Agenda ransomware, first spotted in August 2022, is written in Go and has been used
primarily to target healthcare and education organizations in Africa and Asia. The
ransomware has some customization options, which include changing the filename
extensions of encrypted files and the list of processes and services to terminate.
Agenda ransomware supports several encryption modes that the ransomware operator can
configure through the encryption setting. The ‘help’ screen displays the different encryption
modes available: skip-step , percent , and fast .

Description

skip-step [skip: N,
step: Y]

Encrypt every Y MB of the file, skipping N MB.

fast [f: N]

Encrypt the first N MB of the file.

percent [n: N; p:P]

Encrypt every N MB of the file, skipping P MB, where P equals P%
of the total file size.

BlackCat (ALPHV), the First Rust Ransomware-As-A-Service
The BlackCat (or ALPHV) ransomware came to prominence in late 2021 and is the first
known ransomware to be written in the Rust programming language. The developers behind
BlackCat were first spotted advertising its services in early December 2021 on a Russian
underground forum.

The original ALPHV/BlackCat forum post
The ALPHV threat group runs a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) program and shares
ransom payments with affiliates. ALPHV uses bulletproof hosting to host their web sites and
a Bitcoin mixer to anonymize transactions.
The ALPHV threat group is an early adopter of extortion schemes such as threatening
victims with DDoS attacks, leaking exfiltrated data online as well as intimidating employees
and customers of victim organizations should they not pay ransom. Major organizations and
businesses have been the target of the BlackCat ransomware globally. For example, in
September 2022, the BlackCat ransomware targeted Italy’s state-owned energy services firm
GSE.

SentinelLabs researcher Aleksandar Milenkoski has reverse-engineered BlackCat
ransomware samples and outlined the different encryption modes that BlackCat supports,
the majority of which implement intermittent encryption. The table below lists these
encryption modes.
Encryption mode

Description

Full

Encrypt all file content.

HeadOnly [N]

Encrypt the first N bytes of the file.

DotPattern [N,Y]

Encrypt every N bytes of the file with a step of Y bytes.

SmartPattern [N,P]

Encrypt the first N bytes of the file. BlackCat divides the rest of
the file into equal-sized blocks, such that each block is 10% of
the rest of the file in size. BlackCat encrypts P% of the bytes of
each block.
6/11

AdvancedSmartPattern
[N,P,B]

Encrypt the first N bytes of the file. BlackCat divides the rest of
the file into B equal-sized blocks. BlackCat encrypts P% of the
bytes of each block.

Auto

Combinatory file encryption mode. Encrypt the content of the file
according to one of the file encryption modes Full ,
DotPattern [N,Y], and AdvancedSmartPattern [N,P,B].
BlackCat selects and parametrizes a file encryption mode based
on the filename extension and the size of the file.

An evaluation study subjecting files of varying sizes (50 MB, 500 MB, 5 GB, and 50 GB) to
the BlackCat ransomware revealed that using intermittent encryption can be of significant
benefit to threat actors. For example, in contrast to full encryption, encrypting files using the
Auto file encryption mode resulted in noticeably reduced wallclock processing time starting
at 5 GB file size (8.65 seconds) and a maximum reduction in wallclock processing time of
1.95 minutes at 50 GB file size. Wallclock processing time is the total wallclock time (in
seconds) that the ransomware spends on processing a file, which includes reading,
encrypting, and writing file content. The full results of this study will be presented at the
VirusBulletin Conference 2022.
We also note that BlackCat includes some internal logic for maximizing encryption speed.
The ransomware encrypts files using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption
algorithm if the victim’s platform implements AES hardware acceleration. If not, the
ransomware falls back to the ChaCha20 algorithm that is fully implemented in software.

PLAY Ransomware
PLAY ransomware is a new entrant in the ransomware scene and was first spotted at the
end of June 2022. The ransomware has recently victimized high profile targets, such as the
Court of Córdoba in Argentina in August 2022. PLAY’s ransom note consists of a single word
– PLAY – and a contact email address.
A PLAY ransomware ransom note
In contrast to Agenda and BlackCat, PLAY ransomware does not feature encryption modes
that can be configured by the operator. PLAY orchestrates intermittent encryption based on
the size of the file under encryption, encrypting chunks (file portions) of 0x100000 bytes. For
example, previous research states that under certain conditions, the PLAY ransomware
encrypts:
2 chunks, if the file size is less than or equal to 0x3fffffff bytes;
3 chunks, if the file size is less than or equal to 0x27fffffff bytes;
5 chunks, if the file size is greater than 0x280000000 bytes.

7/11

In our analysis, we observed that a sample encrypted every other 0x100000 byte chunk until
the end of the file. The file consisted only of null characters, which effectively makes the
encrypted and non-encrypted chunks visually distinguishable.

Black Basta Ransomware
Black Basta is a RaaS program that emerged in April 2022 with ransomware samples dating
back to February 2022. Current intelligence indicates that Black Basta emerged from the
crumbled ashes of the Conti operation. The ransomware is written in the C++ programming

8/11

language and supports Windows and Linux operating systems. Black Basta operators use
the double extortion scheme threatening victim organizations with leaking exfiltrated data on
the threat group’s TOR-based web site Basta News should the victims not pay ransom.
Black Basta is rapidly gaining ground on the ransomware scene and targets major
organizations globally – the ransomware operation reported more than 20 victim
organizations on Basta News within the first two weeks of its existence. Targeting, especially
early on, was primarily focused on utilities, technology, financial, and manufacturing
industries. For example, the major German building materials manufacturer Knauf suffered
an attack conducted by Black Basta affiliates at the end of June 2022.

The Basta News web site
Like PLAY ransomware, Black Basta does not feature encryption modes that can be
configured by the ransomware operator, but orchestrates intermittent encryption based on
the size of the file under encryption. Black Basta encrypts:
all file content, if the file size is less than 704 bytes;
every 64 bytes, starting from the beginning of the file, skipping 192 bytes, if the file size
is less than 4 KB;
every 64 bytes, starting from the beginning of the file, skipping 128 bytes, if the file size
is greater than 4 KB.
Our analysis showed that for a file with a size greater than 4 KB, the Black Basta
ransomware encrypted 64 byte portions with an interval of 128 bytes between each, until the
end of the file. In similar fashion to PLAY ransomware, the file consisted only of null
characters, making the encrypted and non-encrypted chunks visually distinguishable.

Conclusion
Intermittent encryption is a very useful tool to ransomware operators. This encryption method
helps to evade some ransomware detection mechanisms and encrypt victims’ files faster.
Given the significant benefits to threat actors while also being practical to implement, we
estimate that intermittent encryption will continue to be adopted by more ransomware
families.
