Change in the Encryption scheme
spamhaus.org/news/article/771/

Spamhaus Malware Labs - Spamhaus's malware research unit - recently observed a wave of
new PandaZeuS malware samples being distributed during the Christmas season.
PandaZeuS, also known as Panda Banker, is an ebanking Trojan that evolved from the
notorious ZeuS trojan and is being used by different threat actors to compromise ebanking
credentials, used by cybercriminals to commit ebanking fraud.
Looking into two recent PandaZeuS campaigns that have just been spread before Christmas
revealed that the most recent version of PandaZeuS comes with a few minor changes. An
important one is the change in the encryption scheme of PandaZeuSâ€™s Base Config. While
PandaZeuS is still using the RC4 binary encryption scheme, it comes with some tiny
modifications. First of all, the versioning of PandaZeuS got updated to 2.6.1:

New version 2.6.1
In the previous version, the base config was AES-265-CBC and RC4 encrypted . While this
is still the case of the most recent version of PandaZeuS too, a slight modification in RC4
has been done:

The screenshot above documented the changes made to by the developers of PandaZeuS
to the code:

1. Initial Key Stream Array is initialized
2. The State Array is modified 4 * 30 times and the keystream value is omitted
3. Reusing the previous indexes, State Array is modified and keystream values obtained
is XORed with encrypted byte.
This can be represented in Python code as:

for i in range(256):
j = (j + S[i] + ord(key[i % len(key)])) % 256
S[i], S[j] = S[j], S[i]
i = j = 0
for x in range(0, 30 * 4):
i = (i + 1) % 256
j = (j + S[i]) % 256
S[i], S[j] = S[j], S[i]
for p in data:
i = (i + 1) % 256
j = (j + S[i]) % 256
S[i], S[j] = S[j], S[i]

While we can only speculate about the reason of this minor change in the encryption scheme
of PandaZeuS, we suspect the intent behind this code change is to break malware extractors
used by malware researchers to extract botnet controllers from PandaZeuS malware
samples.
Looking into sinkhole data of one of these PandaZeuS campaigns shows that the botnet is
mainly targeting English-speaking internet users:
