A ransomware operation named Royal is quickly ramping up, targeting corporations with
ransom demands ranging from $250,000 to over $2 million.
Royal is an operation that launched in January 2022 and consists of a group of vetted and
experienced ransomware actors from previous operations.
Unlike most active ransomware operations, Royal does not operate as a Ransomware-asa-Service but is instead a private group without affiliates.
Vitali Kremez, CEO of AdvIntel, told BleepingComputer that they utilized other ransomware
operation's encryptors when first starting, such as BlackCat.

Soon after, the cybercrime enterprise began using its own encryptors, the first being Zeon
[Sample], which generated ransom notes very similar to Conti's.

However, since the middle of September 2022, the ransomware gang has rebranded again
to 'Royal' and is using that name in ransom notes generated by a new encryptor.

How Royal breaches their victims
The Royal operation has been operating in the shadows, not using a data leak site and
keeping news of their attacks quiet.
However, as the gang became more active this month, victims have appeared at
BleepingComputer, and a sample was uploaded to VirusTotal.
In conversations with Kremez and a victim, BleepingComputer has created a better picture
of how the gang operates.
According to Kremez, the Royal group utilizes targeted callback phishing attacks where
they impersonate food delivery and software providers in emails pretending to be
subscription renewals.

These phishing emails contain phone numbers that the victim can contact to cancel the
alleged subscription, but, in reality, it is a number to a service hired by the threat actors.

When a victim calls the number, the threat actors use social engineering to convince the
victim to install remote access software, which is used to gain initial access to the corporate
network.
A Royal victim who spoke to BleepingComputer shared that the threat actors breached their
network using a vulnerability in their custom web application, showing the threat actors are
also being creative in how they gain access to a network.
Once they gain access to a network, they perform the same activities commonly used by
other human-operated ransomware operations. They deploy Cobalt Strike for persistence,
harvest credentials, spread laterally through the Windows domain, steal data, and ultimately

encrypt devices.
When encrypting files, the Royal encryptor will append the .royal extension to the file
names of encrypted files. For example, test.jpg would be encrypted and renamed to
test.jpg.royal, as shown below.

A Royal victim also told BleepingComputer that they target virtual machines by directly
encrypting their virtual disk files (VMDK). The threat actors then print out the ransom notes
on network printers or create them on encrypted Windows devices.
These ransom notes are named README.TXT and contain a link to the victim's private Tor
negotiation page at royal2xthig3ou5hd7zsliqagy6yygk2cdelaxtni2fyad6dpmpxedid.onion.

The Tor negotiation site is nothing special, simply containing a chat screen where a victim
can communicate with the Royal ransomware operators.
As part of these negotiations, the ransomware gang will provide the ransom demand, with
ransom demands between $250,000 and over $2 million.
The ransomware gang will also commonly decrypt a few files for the victims to prove their
decryptor works and share file lists of the stolen data.

BleepingComputer is unaware of successful payments and has not seen a decryptor for this
ransomware family.
While the group claims to steal data for double-extortion attacks, it does not appear that a
data leak site has been launched under the Royal brand as of yet.
However, it is strongly advised that network, windows, and security admins keep an eye out
for this group, as they are quickly ramping up operations and will likely become one of the
more significant enterprise-targeting ransomware operations.

phishing example.
