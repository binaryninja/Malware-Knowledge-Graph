Keylogger

A recently found downloader for Snake Keylogger brings several slippery evasion tactics
together. It socially engineers its victims, targets organizations/users that failed to patch a
known exploit, and uses a variety of twists and turns in an effort to evade traditional
antivirus (AV) products. In this blog, our team digs into this threat to find out exactly how it
works and what takeaways we can share with people to help protect them from this
extremely stealthy threat.
In a recent threat campaign, the Snake Keylogger was delivered by a downloader that uses
an unconventional file type as a lure, in addition to using embedded files within that lure,
encrypted shellcode, and remote code execution exploits. The Snake Downloader uses
these techniques like tall grass to hide its path toward an intended target.
Because of the public’s familiarity with Microsoft® Office formats, DOC and XLS files tend to
be the lure documents of choice for threat actors. Because of this, it is far less common to
see a PDF file like the one used by this threat as the initial vector in an attack. We’ll

examine why the author of Snake Downloader chose this uncommon threat vector and what
it reveals about the threat actor’s intentions and ultimate goals.

Risk & Impact

Technical Analysis
For an initial understanding of how this attack is structured, let’s look at the different files
involved in our analysis of the downloader and how they relate to each other.
Here are the files used:
“REMMITANCE INVOICE.pdf” – The original PDF attachment/lure document
“has been verified. However pdf, jpeg, xlsx, .docx” – The DOCX file used to
download the rich text format (RTF) file via macros. It is opened by the PDF lure after
prompting the user.
“f_document_shp.doc” – The RTF document downloaded by the DOCX file; it holds
the malformed objects.
“00000000.ole” – The object linking and embedding (OLE) object extracted and
reconstructed from “f_document_shp.doc”
“00000000.bin” – The encrypted shellcode extracted from “00000000.ole”
“fresh.exe” – Snake Keylogger
HP Wolf Security recently discovered this threat when they came across a PDF attachment
named “REMMITANCE INVOICE.pdf.” Running this file prompts the user to open a DOCX
file, which is deceptively named “has been verified. However PDF, Jpeg, xlsx, .docx.”
This strange choice of filename was chosen for a specific reason; at a casual glance, the
filename cleverly makes it appear as if the file has been automatically vetted and verified by
the victim’s machine, as shown in Figure 1.

This is a type of social engineering that relies heavily on the victim only giving the popup a
cursory glance. The threat’s author hopes that the victim will be too busy or distracted to
properly read the “Open File” dialog, which means that many people working in a fastpaced office environment may fall victim to this threat.

Figure 1 – Prompt displayed after opening “REMMITANCE INVOICE.pdf”
If this DOCX file is opened and macros are enabled by the victim, this triggers the download
of an RTF file while displaying the strangely named document in Microsoft® Word. Users
who look closely will also see that Word reaches out to a certain URL while loading, as
shown in Figure 2, coinciding with DNS requests to the same URL.

Figure 2 – URL displayed when loading Word
For a closer look at the file, our team viewed the Office Open XML (OOXML) file contents
and found the URL (vtaurl[.]com/IHytw) in the document’s relationships file. We can also
see that an OLE object is being loaded from this URL. Once the RTF document
3/10

(f_document_shp.doc) is downloaded, we can check it for any OLE objects, such as the
two malformed objects shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 – Malformed OLE objects found in f_document_shp.doc
To take a closer look at these OLE objects, we reconstructed them first, as seen in Figure 4.
Then, using oletools to view information about the objects, we find that one of them
(00000000.ole) mentions the Microsoft Equation Editor in its description. This feature is
often used by attackers to exploit known Word vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code.

Figure 4 – Information about one of the reconstructed OLE objects
Following this information, we find shellcode in the OLE that exploits the Equation Editor’s
remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882). This vulnerability was patched over
four years ago, but there are still many unpatched machines in the wild that remain
vulnerable. The shellcode is shown being extracted from the OLENativeStream structure of
the object in Figure 5.

Figure 5 – Extracting encrypted shellcode from 00000000.ole
Since the shellcode is encrypted at first, we must look for the moment during execution
where it decrypts itself. To do so, we can use a tool like runsc to convert the extracted
shellcode into executable code (see Figure 6), then walk through the code with a debugger.

Figure 6 – Converting shellcode to attach to debugger
As we step through the shellcode, after defining the correct offset, the file begins decrypting
itself. In particular, the highlighted instruction shown in Figure 7 is quite revealing. For each
iteration of this decryption loop, it shows a specific register (ECX) getting multiplied by a
static value and added. Mathematic operations like this can be typical for decryption
routines.

Figure 7 – Mathematic operations used in shellcode decryption
If we follow the dump from register ECX, it reveals more and more with each iteration as the
shellcode is decrypted. When finished, a reference for downloading fresh.exe can be seen,
which is the Snake Keylogger itself. This keylogger is a prevalent information stealer, also
known as the 404 Keylogger, which has been in circulation since late 2020. This decrypted
shellcode can be seen in Figure 8.

Figure 8 – Decrypted shellcode used to download Snake Keylogger
Once the shellcode in the RTF file downloads the keylogger, the Snake Downloader has
done its job, and now it’s up to Snake Keylogger to continue from here. Keyloggers such as
Snake lurk in the background on an infected machine and wait for the user to input any juicy
information via the keyboard, particularly website logins, such as those used for banking or
a cryptocurrency wallet. That information then gets exfiltrated back to the threat actors and
used for their own financial gain.

Conclusion
Although it may be less common to see PDFs used as malicious file attachments, they
should still be taken just as seriously and handled with the same precautions as any other
potentially infected attachments. In the case of Snake Downloader, the lure document is
only the first step in an array of tactics used to obfuscate the installation of the Snake
Keylogger payload.
From its use of embedded files, encrypted shellcode, and even remote code execution
exploits, it’s clear that this downloader goes further than most to hide its initial execution on
the system. While the CVE-2017-11882 exploit had a patch created for it in 2017, it has
been a slow process to get all affected machines patched, which means it’s still one of the
most common vulnerabilities that threat actors continue to exploit. This latest example
speaks to the prevalence of such attacks, and emphasizes the ongoing need for diligence
when it comes to patching your organization’s endpoints, and distrusting attachments and
files shared over the internet.

W­­ho is Affect­ed?
Those with machines still vulnerable to CVE-2017-11882 could be infected by Snake
Downloader/ Keylogger malware. The Snake Downloader threat is not confined to a
particular industry or sector, but rather takes advantage of busy or distracted individuals to
perpetrate its malicious activity.

Mitigation Tips
You can take the following steps to reduce your exposure to this threat:
Always remain cautious when opening email attachments, regardless of file type.
Be sure to carefully read all security popups when you’re being asked to manually
enable something on your machine, particularly macros.
Ensure you stay up to date with all Security Updates from Microsoft to stay protected
from exploits like CVE-2017-11882.
Monitor accounts for unusual and unauthorized access that falls outside of the
baseline (MITRE D3FEND techniques D3-AZET, D3-LAM).
