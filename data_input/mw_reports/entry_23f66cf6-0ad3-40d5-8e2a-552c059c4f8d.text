Microsoft revealed last night that it successfully disrupted a hacking campaign associated
with the Russian military intelligence service GRU.
The group is known in infosec industry circles as APT28, Fancy Bear, or Strontium, and has
been previously linked to cyber-espionage campaigns aimed at numerous governments
around the world, including to the hack of the Democratic National Committee ahead of the
2016 US Presidential Election.

Microsoft takes over six APT28 domains
Microsoft President Brad Smith said that Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) successfully
executed a court order to transfer control of six internet domains created by the group. The
six domains are:
my-iri.org
hudsonorg-my-sharepoint.com
senate.group

adfs-senate.email
office365-onedrive.com
The first domain was registered to look like a domain for the International Republican
Institute, which promotes democratic principles. The second was registered to mimic the
Hudson Institute, an organization known for its discussions on election cybersecurity. The
last four were blatant attempts at mimicking domains part of the US Senate's IT
infrastructure. Microsoft said it notified all three organizations.

Microsoft has now taken over 84 APT28 domains
Based on their format, the domains were most likely supposed to be used as part of spearphishing operations.
Microsoft says it managed to gain ownership of the domains before they were used in any
attacks.
The OS maker said this was the twelfth time they used a court order to take control of
domains they believed to be associated with APT28's attack infrastructure. Smith said they
have now taken control of 84 APT28 domains in the last two years.
"Despite last week's steps, we are concerned by the continued activity targeting these and
other sites and directed toward elected officials, politicians, political groups and think tanks
across the political spectrum in the United States," Smith said. "Taken together, this pattern
mirrors the type of activity we saw prior to the 2016 election in the United States and the
2017 election in France."
Last week, Reuters reported that the FBI was investigating cyber-attacks on the
congressional campaign of a Democratic candidate in California, albeit there's no evidence
that Microsoft's intervention is tied to that investigation.
Speaking at a conference in mid-July, Tom Burt, Corporate Vice President for Customer
Security and Trust, Microsoft, said Microsoft had blocked at the time the first cyber-attacks
on the US 2018 midterm elections.
In May this year, the FBI also intervened in a similar fashion to take control of domains that
the APT28 group was using to control the VPNFilter IoT botnet.

Microsoft officially launches AccountGuard service
While announcing Microsoft's intervention to take down the six APT28 domains, Smith also
announced the launch of the AccountGuard service designed to help US election and
campaign entities secure their IT infrastructure against nation-state attacks.

Bleeping Computer first broke the story about Microsoft's new AccountGuard service at the
start of the month â€”more details here.
After Microsoft revealed its takeover of the six APT28 domains, Google also issued a
security advisory on its blog about the dangers of government-backed phishing operations.
Last week, Google added support for controlling the behavior of "Government backed
attacks" alerts inside the G Suite service.

Everyone blames the Russians for hacking the DNC during the 2016 presidential
election. However, since the DNC never allowed any security agency to inspect their
servers, there is no actual PROOF that the Russians had anything to do with the
release of the Clinton and Podesta emails, and it is just as likely that the emails were
leaked by a person working for the Clinton campaign.

Lisa Page testified under oath 3 weeks ago that the whole Russia narrative was
completely made up , Russians were never involved in any hacking and claimed her
FBI superiors made her cover up the fact that Russia was never involved.
She also testified that her superiors purposely altered top secret documents to make
sure they covered their tracks .
Of course the main stream media never reported it and will continue to not report it.

Yes. And now the MSM wants to protect us from "Fake News" by trying to suppress
independent creators on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc. They call everyone else
"nazis" but they seem to be using the same techniques that the Nazis used to control
the media and suppress dissent.
