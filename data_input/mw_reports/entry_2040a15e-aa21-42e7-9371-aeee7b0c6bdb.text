Ransomware Gangs are Starting to Look Like Ocean’s 11

July 8, 2021

The cybercrime underground ecosystem once housed cybercriminals who would perform
attacks from start to finish on their own. This one-man show has nearly completely dissolved
though as one of the most prominent trends that emerged instead is the specialization of
cybercriminals in different niches. If we take a typical attack, we’ll see that not necessarily
every cybercriminal will have the know-how to perform each stage involved in the attack:
Code (code or acquire malware with the desired capabilities)
Spread (infect targeted victims)
Extract (maintain access to infected machines)
Monetize (get profits from the attack)

Each stage includes various malicious activities that different actors specialize in. As
ransomware operations have been growing and maturing, KELA’s researchers have
been observing more cybercriminals offering accompanying services that fall into one
of the four niches. When looking specifically into the ransomware supply chain we can
see many actors piling up in the “extract” niche – where actors focus on escalating
privileges within a compromised network – and the “monetize” niche – where actors
are involved in the negotiation process with victims, DDoS attacks and spam calls. In
this post, KELA focuses on these two niches in order to better understand the actors who
have surfaced around the growing RaaS ecosystem.
Some of the major takeaways include:

KELA assesses that domain admin access level of privileges eases ransomware
attacks, therefore it is more valuable for cybercriminals. However, only 19% of listings
offer domain admin access rights, which raises demand for intrusion specialists
capable of escalation of privileges.
Using DARKBEAST, KELA observed multiple posts describing a new role in the
ransomware ecosystem – negotiators, whose purpose is to force the victim to
pay a ransom using insider information and threats.
As ransomware attackers have begun using additional methods to threaten
victims and their partners, such as DDoS attacks and spam calls, the need for
such services also appeared. The ransomware ecosystem therefore more and more
resembles a corporation with diversified roles inside the company and multiple
outsourcing activities.
In order to prevent the attacks and mitigate the risks of being attacked by such a skilled
hacking community, enterprise defenders should continually monitor their key assets
and their supply chain to mitigate their most relevant threats from the cybercrime
underground ecosystem before further damage occurs.

Escalation of Privileges
Following more than a year of monitoring Initial Access Brokers using KELA’s intelligence
technologies, KELA’s researchers identified the influence that the obtained level of privileges
(i.e. user or domain/local administrator rights) has on the price of access for sale. For
instance, in previous research, KELA observed threat actors raising their prices by 25-115%
following their success in escalating privileges up to the domain admin level.
KELA’s analysis of network access listings publicly offered for sale in January-May 2021
shows that average domain admin access cost at least 10 times more than access to a
machine with user rights. It seems to be a rarer type of offering: domain admin access
was literally mentioned only in 19% of listings where initial access brokers specified
the level of privileges. That would mean that the majority of offers pertain to lower
privileged access, mostly user rights level.

Note: when we compared the listings, we included into the domain admin category only those listings
where actors specifically mentioned it and not just the “admin” type

As we see, the domain admin access is a more pricey and more valuable type of initial
access. Even the percentage of payment ransomware affiliates receive for their work can
depend on the level of privileges. For example, in one post, users were looking to work with
a ransomware affiliate program or affiliates who supply initial access. They specified: “In the
case when we started the process with user rights and encrypted the network after
successfully escalating it, our share [of the ransom – KELA] will be a little higher.”

However, not all Initial Access Brokers and threat actors know how to gain such types of
privileges. This is where actors experienced with privilege escalation enter the stage. In
order to understand their work, let’s refresh our memory on how the RaaS supply chain
works.
Here is a possible scenario of a ransomware attack involving multiple participants: it starts
from opportunistic attacks involving phishing attacks or mass exploitation of publicly known
vulnerabilities. Such attacks can be performed by Initial Access Brokers themselves or
different actors then selling gained credentials on markets or directly to other cybercriminals.
These attacks enable threat actors to gain an entry point that they can transform into a wider
compromise and establish a sustainable entry channel for other cybercriminals – remote
access through RDP, VPN, and other methods. Once the entry channel is finalized, the
broker puts up the access for sale where it can be bought by ransomware affiliates who are
then proceeding to lateral movement and further malicious processes with the ultimate goal
to plant ransomware. The question is: how do they move from user-privileged access to
a ransomware attack?

5/15

Possible ransomware attack scenario illustrated by KELA.

If ransomware attackers start a lateral movement from a machine of domain admin, they
have better chances to successfully deploy ransomware in a compromised network.
However, if all they have is user access, then they need to escalate privileges by themselves
– or call for the help of skilled fellows.

Demand for cybercriminals able to escalate privileges (auto translated by Google from Russian)

KELA located multiple posts seeking skilled intrusion specialists (“pentesters,” as
Russian-speaking cybercriminals slangy name them) capable of gaining domain
admin-privileged access. One of them mentions escalating privileges up to admin rights on
“bots from a botnet, European corporations,” which shows another role in the ransomware
supply chain that can be outsourced: botnet operators, which can supply the leads to initial
access brokers, intrusion specialists, and ransomware affiliates. The post reads: “This is
teamwork, we pay a percentage of the profit. We are looking for one person to work out 2-3
bots per day. Constant flow until the end of the year is guaranteed. A little about teamwork:
we already have specialists, you can count on fixed bonuses in USD and about 10% from
the financial profit.”
This means that these actors are looking for an intrusion specialist to escalate privileges on
machines from the corporate networks included in a botnet. Then, they would be able to use
the access for attacks, including ransomware. Since they mention a fixed fee and 10% share
from the “financial profit”, it can mean such specialists will get a percentage of the ransom.
Based on several different offers, KELA assesses the intrusion specialists can be paid
10-30% of the ransom for escalating privileges up to the domain user level.
Users ready to escalate privileges often offer other services and perform other roles in the
ransomware ecosystem, namely as Initial Access Brokers or affiliates/affiliates’ partners. For
example, in a thread titled “Will escalate admin rights, will gain domain administrator,” an
author offers to perform the whole ransomware encryption process: to bypass antivirus
solutions, steal data, delete backups and shadow copies and even encrypt a network. There
are other users ready to do the whole job once they’re provided with initial access. Another
example shows an Initial Access Broker who usually sells VPN access listings – also ready
to escalate privileges for a fee.

It is important to understand not every actor that offers escalation of privileges may be willing
to cooperate with ransomware affiliates. For example, one offer KELA discovered specifically
mentions “we do not work with crypto lockers,” meaning ransomware. These threat actors
stated they focus on working with payment processing systems and using credit card data to
gain profits. It illustrates the variety of monetization methods employed by cybercriminals;
while now all eyes are on ransomware, it is crucial to remember defending against other
threats.

Negotiators
A brand-new position seems to appear in the RaaS landscape: negotiators. Initially, most
ransomware operators communicated with victims via email which was mentioned in ransom
notes. As RaaS grew and became more prominent and business-like, many actors started
establishing their own portals through which all communications were held. The ransomware

8/15

developers or affiliates were determining the ransom sum, offering discounts, and discussing
conditions of payment. However, now this part of the attack also seems to be an outsourced
activity – at least for some affiliates and/or developers.
Why do ransomware gangs need negotiators? Two hypotheses seem valid:
Victims started using negotiators – while a few years ago there was no such
profession, now there is a demand for negotiating services. Ransomwarenegotiation specialists partner with the insurance companies and have no lack of
clients. Ransom actors had to up their game as well in order to make good
margins.
As most ransom actors probably are not native English speakers, more delicate
negotiations – specifically around very high budgets and surrounding complex
business situations – required better English. When REvil’s representative was
looking for a “support” member of the team to hold negotiations, they specifically
mentioned “conversational English” as one of the demands. This is not a new case:
actors are interested in native English speakers to use for spear-phishing campaigns.

REvil hires “support [manager] with conversational English” to negotiate with victims, speak with media
outlets, recovery and information security companies.

KELA noticed several threads on Russian-speaking underground forums where actors
were looking for negotiators or discussing their work. In March 2021, a threat actor
stated they have access to a large company, most likely in Saudi Arabia, and need a
negotiator to contact top managers of several companies. The actor specified they look for

10/15

an insider or someone with well-established contacts among “recovery and cybersecurity
companies in Saudi Arabia.” In the case of the ransom successfully received, the actor
promised to pay 1-5 million USD to the negotiator. Several actors responded to the offer.

The work process of such negotiators can be inferred from a dispute between the Conti and
REvil (Sodinokibi) operators from one side and a negotiators’ team they worked with – from
another. This is how Conti’s representative described the collaboration confirming that the
service was quite new for the affiliates: “We got interested. When we asked him how it works,
we said that when there will be a suitable material [a victim network – KELA], we will offer it
to outsourcers [negotiators, among others – KELA].”
The dispute began after an attack on Broward County Public Schools, in which Conti
demanded a 40 million USD ransom. It turns out, the negotiations were held both by Conti’s
affiliates and side negotiators who didn’t manage to collaborate properly. The negotiators
claimed they managed to gain insider information that could force the victim to pay the
ransom. However, according to the negotiators, the affiliates meddled in the process and
ruined their efforts. Conti’s representative argued the negotiators didn’t behave
professionally. REvil’s representative also shared his experience of working with the same
negotiators’ team, accusing them of scamming.

The actors and the forums’ administration didn’t come to a conclusion about who was a
scammer in these cases. However, it illustrates the demand and supply for negotiating
services. While the dispute was held on the Russian-speaking cybercrime forum
Exploit, users from another forum XSS got interested and asked for the negotiators’
contacts. The REvil gang, as mentioned above, was also looking to fill a negotiator
position, promising a monthly salary of 3,500-30,000 USD (a fixed fee plus “tips”).
KELA’s findings show that for such services negotiators ask for 10-20% of the
ransom.

DDoS and Spam Services

13/15

Besides the cybercriminals directly involved in the ransomware supply chain, ransomware
operators and affiliates use other services that primarily help them to intimidate victims. For
example, DDoS attacks became a common way for ransomware operators to force
victims to pay the ransom. In order to perform the actual attacks, REvil was observed
seeking to hire a team or a person with a botnet that could DDoS a targeted company
and its clients as an additional measure. The REvil representative stated: “Estimate your
potential – we can ask to shut down even Microsoft for a couple of days.”
Another method of intimidating victims into paying is through spam calls and SMS
campaigns to a victim company, its clients and partners, or to media outlets. These activities
may be carried out by the ransomware operators or, as with other auxiliary operations,
outsourced to other actors who specialize in them. As a showcase of the variety of pressure
means used by ransom actors, KELA observed Avaddon ransomware operators looking
for fax spam services – which can be used both for spamming the victim with threats
and as the ransomware delivery vector in certain cases.
In addition, just like corporate enterprises, ransomware operators have design and coding
requirements. Since they need it for malicious purposes, they also look for such services on
cybercrime forums.

Conclusion
During recent years, ransomware gangs grew into cybercrime corporations with members or
“employees” specializing in different parts of ransomware attacks and various accompanying
services. The recent ban of ransomware on two major Russian-speaking forums does not
seem to affect this ecosystem, because only the advertisement of affiliate programs was
banned on the forums. Ransomware operators and affiliates still remain active participants in
cybercrime discussions, they can hire others, buy their services and offers. Ransomware

14/15

operations attract cybercriminals by being a fast way to make profits – not only for
ransomware developers and affiliates but for everyone involved in their activities with millions
of USD in ransom.
Confronting such groups require enterprise defenders to invest in:
1. Cybersecurity awareness and training for all key stakeholders and employees to
ensure that key individuals know how to safely use their credentials and personal information
online. This cyber training should include specifying how to identify suspicious activities,
such as possible scam emails, or unusual requests from unauthorized individuals or email
addresses.
2. Regular vulnerability monitoring and patching to continually protect their entire
network infrastructure and prevent any unauthorized access by Initial Access Brokers or
other network intruders.
3. Targeted and automated monitoring of key assets to immediately detect threats
emerging from the cybercrime underground ecosystem. Constant automated and scalable
monitoring of an organizations’ assets could significantly improve maintaining a reduced
attack surface, ultimately helping organizations thwart possible attempts of cyberattacks
against them.
