Internet Crime Complaint Center

2010 Internet Crime Report

Executive Summary
Now in its tenth year, the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) has become a vital resource
for victims of online crime and for law enforcement investigating and prosecuting offenders.
In 2010, IC3 received the second-highest number of complaints since its inception. IC3 also
reached a major milestone this year when it received its two-millionth complaint. On average,
IC3 receives and processes 25,000 complaints per month.
IC3 is more than a repository for victim complaints. It serves as a conduit for law enforcement to
share information and pursue cases that often span jurisdictional boundaries. IC3 was founded in
2000 as a joint effort between the National White Collar Crime Center (NW3C)/Bureau of Justice
Assistance (BJA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). That partnership leveraged the
resources necessary to aid law enforcement in every aspect of an Internet fraud complaint.
The most common victim complaints in 2010 were non-delivery of payment/merchandise,
scams impersonating the FBI (hereafter “FBI-related scams”) and identity theft. Victims of these
crimes reported losing hundreds of millions of dollars.
Through a number of technological advancements, IC3 has streamlined the way it processes
and refers victim complaints to law enforcement. In 2004, IC3 developed Automatch, an
automated internal complaint grouping and analytical search tool. The design of Automatch
is based on an assessment of the IC3 partnership aimed at defining a joint workflow for the
project partners with different service requirements. IC3 IT staff continually review and update
Automatch to meet the needs of analysts who build cases for law enforcement worldwide
gathering all related information based on commonalities in the IC3 data. In 2009, NW3C
developed the state-of-the-art Internet Complaint Search and Investigation System (ICSIS),
which fosters seamless collaboration among law enforcement from multiple jurisdictions.
Expert IC3 analysts also provide key analytical and case support.
The 2010 Internet Crime Report demonstrates how pervasive online crime has become, affecting
people in all demographic groups. The report provides specific details about various crimes,
their victims and the perpetrators. It also shows how IC3 continually adapts its methods to meet
the needs of the public and law enforcement.

History
The Internet Fraud Complaint Center (IFCC), a
partnership between NW3C/BJA and the FBI, was
established on May 8, 2000. The IFCC changed its name
to IC3 in 2003 to reflect its expanded mission in the
fight against cyber crime.

jurisdictions. For example, if the New York City Police
Department requests to receive only those complaints
with a specified dollar loss, IC3 analysts can comply
with that request. The system automates approximately
40 percent of the complaints it receives, allowing
analysts to process more complaints.

In May 2010, IC3 marked its 10th anniversary. By early
November, IC3 had received two million complaints.
IC3 received 303,809 complaints in 2010, averaging
25,317 per month (by comparison, the IFCC received
20,014 complaints in its first six months).

In addition to allowing all law enforcement – local,
state, and federal agencies—to search, analyze, and
compile information, ICSIS also allows these users to
communicate and share information. Users can export
case information to other software programs to create
link charts and presentations.

Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany have used
IC3 as the model for similar cyber crime centers. IC3’s
public awareness efforts range from teaching children
how to protect themselves online to showing senior
citizens how to avoid identity theft. Also, IC3 provides
presentations to local, national and international law
enforcement and to key industrial leaders.

IC3 analysts are available to compile data to give
law enforcement a more detailed case. Analysts and
investigators have the ability to develop case leads with
multiple victims and jurisdictions, often involving
the same perpetrator. The case analysis in multijurisdictional collaboration allows law enforcement
access to new levels of information, which they can
then use to build stronger cases.

Cutting-Edge Approach To Fighting Internet
Crime

IC3 tracks cases after they are referred to law
enforcement. Referred cases are given a disposition
code based on the direction law enforcement intends
to take. This gives analysts the chance to measure the
relative success of a case.

In 2010, IC3 added the remote access feature to the
IC3.net database tools. This feature gives all FBI
personnel the ability to perform searches and case
development work. With this system and last year’s
launch of ICSIS, IC3 has dramatically expanded the
capacity and scope of services offered. The combined
power of these two high-tech tools aid law enforcement
in identifying and prosecuting cyber crime.

IC3 analysts prepared 1,420 cases (representing 42,808
complaints). Law enforcement prepared 698 cases
(representing 4,015 complaints). In addition, law
enforcement requested FBI assistance on 598 Internet
crime matters. Of the referrals prepared by the FBI
analysts, 122 open investigations were reported, which
resulted in 31 arrests, 6 convictions, 17 grand jury
subpoenas, and 55 search/seizure warrants.

Law enforcement can set complaint thresholds
for their jurisdictions within the Complaint
Management System (CMS) so agencies can have
real-time information of crimes occurring within their

Internet Crime Complaint Center

Of the 303,809 complaints received in 2010, IC3 referred
121,710 to law enforcement. IC3 auto-referred 82,372
of these complaints to 1,629 law enforcement agencies.
IC3 referred 2,597 child pornography complaints to the
National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.
Analysts also referred 1,970 urgent complaints containing
threats of bodily harm to local law enforcement agencies.
Additionally, Automatch attached 235,275 of the new
complaints to 44,101 pre-existing groupings.
All complaints received at IC3 are used for intelligence
reports, informational purposes and to identify emerging
trends. Those complaints revealing a reported dollar loss
or other victimization are referred to law enforcement.

Internet Crime Trends
The IC3 experienced substantial growth in complaints,
referrals, and dollar loss claims since 2000. In
particular, there has been a significant increase in
referrals in the two-year period since CMS and ICSIS
were implemented in early 2009.
Historically, auction fraud has been the leading
complaint reported by victims, with a high of 71.2
percent of all referrals in 2004. However, in 2010,
auction fraud represents slightly more than 10 percent of
referrals. This demonstrates the growing diversification
of crimes related to the Internet. The steady decline in the
total number of complaints and referrals of auction fraud
over the last several years has altered the top complaint

categories. The reason for this reduction is unknown.
However, a possible explanation is that complaint levels
are normalizing as businesses and consumers discover
and implement ways to make previously uncharted areas
of online commerce safer and more reliable.

The age of those reporting crimes to IC3 is becoming
more evenly distributed. Early in IC3’s history, the 30-39
age group represented the largest complainant reporting
pool. Today, complainants 40-59 years old represent the
two largest groups reporting crimes to IC3. However,
historic trends indicate a continuing shift toward those in
the 50-59 and 60-and-over category, which will further
flatten the overall distribution of complainants. Those in
the 60-and-over category account for the most dramatic
rise in complaints over the entire 10 years.
The gender gap in crime reporting has dramatically
narrowed. Early in IC3’s history, men reported crime
at a ratio of more than 2.5 to 1 over women. Today,
men and women report crimes almost equally. In many
states, a slightly higher proportion of women than
men report crimes to IC3. The narrowed reporting gap
between the sexes has significantly impacted the dollar
loss between men and women over the last 10 years.
During the course of IC3’s early history, men reported
a loss of more than $2.00 for every $1.00 reported by a
woman. According to the 2010 data, men now report a
loss of $1.25 for every $1.00 reported by a woman.

Internet Crime Working Group
The Internet Crime Working Group (ICWG) is a
collaboration with IC3 analysts and the National CyberForensics and Training Alliance (NCFTA). ICWG uses
email to exchange critical unclassified data related to cyber
intelligence to enhance cases and intelligence reports.

There were 259 items discussed among ICWG members in
2010. Of those, 101 items resulted in information sent to law
enforcement, and 81 items sent to industry representatives.
The ICWG recovered and reported 3,530 unique credit card
numbers and 92 Social Security numbers, and developed 73 into
NCFTA Assessments or IC3 monthly trend report articles.

Complaint Characteristics

Complainant-Perpetrator Demographics

During 2010, the non-delivery of payment or
merchandise was the most reported offense, followed by
FBI-related scams and identity theft.

Investigating and prosecuting cyber crime is unique
because the victim and perpetrator can be separated
by a few blocks or thousands of miles. Successful
investigations often require the cooperation of multiple
agencies to resolve cases. Table 5 highlights this truly
borderless phenomenon. A minority of perpetrators
reside in the same state as the complainants. This
underscores the national and global nature of Internet
crime and the need for multi-jurisdictional cooperation
to combat it.

IC3 primarily refers complaints with claims of dollar
losses (dollar loss claims). Other complaints, which may
represent a comparatively large percentage of complaints
received, do not contain dollar loss claims, but are
intended only to alert IC3 of the scam. For a more
detailed explanation of complaint categories used by IC3,

Complaint category statistics may not always produce
an accurate picture. They are based on complainant
perception. However, the CMS was designed to mitigate
a certain degree of subjectivity, allowing complaint

Men reported greater dollar losses than women (at a
ratio of $1.25 to every $1.00). Individuals 60-and-over
reported higher median amounts of loss than other
age groups.

Success Stories
“This is excellent. We’ve already identified several good
leads based on the information you were able to extract.
Thanks so much for taking the time to help.”
Special Agent W. Blake Cook, U.S. State Department, after
receiving information on a case from an IC3 analyst.
IC3 does its part to ensure that victims of online
crime are heard by giving their complaints to the
proper authorities and providing law enforcement
with valuable information related to the case. While
analysts don’t always see the outcome of their work,
the evolution of IC3’s complaint-handling process has
resulted in analysts working more closely with law
enforcement, which in turn produces better feedback.
Not So Free Samples
In the one case, a company offered free trial samples
of products to victims who paid for the shipping
and handling with a credit card. The company then
made unauthorized purchases on the cards. A total
of 372 complaints were lodged against the company,
with reported losses totaling more than $53,000. An
IC3 analyst noticed the high volume of complaints
and used open-and closed-source analysis to build a
case. From there, he referred it to relevant local law
enforcement, which opened a joint investigation with
the state Attorney General, who remains in constant
contact with the IC3 analyst for assistance and updated
complaint data.
Fraud on the Wire
A case involving wire transfer fraud involved more
than 1,000 complaints, totaling nearly $3 million in
reported losses. An IC3 analyst assisted state and local
officials with the investigation. The state issued 15
subpoenas and reviewed more than 115 surveillance
videos from one specific wire transfer company with
offices throughout the state. This case could take
several years to reach a full conclusion, but a state law
enforcement official acknowledged that IC3 has been “a
great resource” in producing needed information for his
team. “IC3 is a terrific asset in our fight against major
organized fraud schemes and an invaluable ally to law
enforcement,” the state official said.

False Advertisement
A marketing company promotes its customers’ websites
through television and online ads. However, the victims
are often left empty-handed with no advertisement
of their business, and the company stops any form of
communication with them. IC3 originally sent this case
to the federal officials of relevant jurisdiction with 15
complaints that reported losses of more than $130,000. Based
on the conversation between the IC3 analyst and federal law
enforcement, this case has exploded in scope. The number
of victims reached the hundreds, and reported losses totaled
more than $20 million. Federal law enforcement continues
to investigate this case and regularly contacts IC3 for further
complaints and information.
International Assistance
In April 2010, Romanian National Police charged
70 people for their roles in an organized crime
group engaged in Internet fraud. In one of the
country’s largest-ever police actions, over 700 law
enforcement officers conducted arrests and searches
at 103 locations, while at the same time, police in the
Czech Republic searched 10 locations and arrested 11
Romanian nationals.
In an 18-month period, Romanian police and
prosecutors conducted more than 500 wiretaps and
identified over 1,200 victims, approximately half of
them Americans. The total loss was over $2 million.
The FBI Legal Attache in Bucharest and the Romanian
Threat Focus Cell Cyber Task Force, including IC3,
played a vital role in assisting the Romanian police in
gathering evidence for their investigations of the subjects.
IC3 identified additional victims subjects. IC3 used
victim-provided information such as subject addresses,

Mystery/Secret Shopper Schemes

•

Source: IC3
Date: January 14, 2010

IC3 has been alerted to an increase in employment
schemes pertaining to mystery/secret shopper positions.
Many retail and service corporations hire evaluators
to perform secret or random checks on themselves or
their competitors, and fraudsters are capitalizing on this
employment opportunity.
Victims have reported to IC3 they were contacted via
e-mail and U.S. mail to apply to be a mystery shopper.
Applicants are asked to send a resume and are purportedly
subject to an extensive background check before being
accepted as a mystery shopper. The employees are sent
a check with instructions to shop at a specified retailer
for a specific length of time and spend a specific amount
on merchandise from the store. The employees receive
instructions to take note of the store’s environment, color,
payment procedures, gift items, and shopping/carrier bags
and report back to the employer. The second evaluation
is the ease and accuracy of wiring money from the retail
location. The money to be wired is also included in the
check sent to the employee. The remaining balance is the
employee’s payment for the completion of the assignment.
After merchandise is purchased and money is wired, the
employees are advised by the bank the check cashed was
counterfeit, and they are responsible for the money lost in
addition to bank fees incurred.
In other versions of the scheme, applicants are
requested to provide bank account information to have
money directly deposited into their accounts. The
fraudster then has acquired access to these victims’
accounts and can withdraw money, which makes the
applicant a victim of Identity Theft.

Tips
Here are some tips you can use to avoid becoming
a victim of employment schemes associated with
mystery/secret shopping:
•
•
•

Do not respond to unsolicited (spam) e-mail.
Do not click on links contained within an
unsolicited e-mail.
Be cautious of e-mail claiming to contain pictures
in attached files, as the files may contain viruses.
Only open attachments from known senders.
Virus scan all attachments, if possible.

•

•

Avoid filling out forms contained in e-mail
messages that ask for personal information.
Always compare the link in the e-mail to the
link you are actually directed to and determine if
they match and will lead you to a legitimate site.
There are legitimate mystery/secret shopper
programs available. Research the legitimacy on
companies hiring mystery shoppers. Legitimate
companies will not charge an application fee
and will accept applications on-line.
No legitimate mystery/secret shopper program
will send payment in advance and ask the
employee to send a portion of it back.

Individuals who believe they have information
pertaining to mystery/secret shopper schemes are
encouraged to file a complaint at www.ic3.gov.

New Twist on Counterfeit Check Schemes
Targeting U.S. Law Firms
Source: IC3
Date: January 21, 2010

The FBI continues to receive reports of counterfeit
check scheme targeting U.S. law firms. As previously
reported, scammers send e-mails to lawyers, claiming
to be overseas and seeking legal representation to
collect delinquent payments from third parties in
the U.S. The law firm receives a retainer agreement,
invoices reflecting the amount owed, and a check
payable to the law firm. The firm is instructed to extract
the retainer fee, including any other fees associated with
the transaction, and wire the remaining funds to banks
in Korea, China, Ireland, or Canada. By the time the
check is determined to be counterfeit, the funds have
already been wired overseas.
In a new twist, the fraudulent client seeking legal
representation is an ex-wife “on assignment” in an Asian
country, and she claims to be pursuing a collection of
divorce settlement monies from her ex-husband in the
U.S. The law firm agrees to represent the ex-wife, sends
an e-mail to the ex-husband, and receives a “certified”
check for the settlement via delivery service. The ex-wife
instructs the firm to wire the funds, less the retainer fee,
to an overseas bank account. When the scam is executed
successfully, the law firm wires the money before
discovering the check is counterfeit.
All Internet users need to be cautious when they receive
unsolicited e-mails. Law firms are advised to conduct
as much due diligence as possible before engaging
in transactions with parties who are handling their

business solely via e-mail, particularly those parties
claiming to reside overseas.
Please view an additional public service announcement
posted to the IC3 Web site regarding a similar Asian
Extortion Scheme located at the following link, http://

who receive information pertaining to counterfeit check
schemes are encouraged to file a complaint at www.ic3.gov.

National Center for Disaster Fraud to Coordinate
Haitian and Chilean Fraud Complaints

•

Source: U.S. Department of Justice
FBI
Date: March 10, 2010

Shortly after the earthquake in Haiti last January, the
FBI and the National Center for Disaster Fraud (NCDF)
established a telephone hotline to report suspected
fraud associated with relief efforts. That number,
(866) 720-5721, was initially staffed for the purpose
of reporting suspected scams being perpetrated by
criminals in the aftermath of the Haitian earthquake.
Since then with the recent earthquake in Chile our
efforts have expanded to identify similar fraud activity
coming out of that disaster. Therefore the public is
encouraged to call this same number (866) 720-5721
to report suspected fraud from either disaster. The
telephone line is staffed by a live operator 24 hours a
day, seven days a week. Additionally, e-mail information
can be directly sent to disaster@leo.gov.
The National Center for Disaster Fraud was originally
established by the Department of Justice to investigate,
prosecute, and deter fraud in the wake of Hurricane
Katrina, when billions of dollars in federal disaster relief
poured into the Gulf Coast Region. Now, its mission has
expanded to include suspected fraud from any natural
or manmade disaster. More than 20 federal agencies,
including the FBI, participate in the NCDF, allowing
the center to act as a centralized clearinghouse of
information related to Haitian or Chilean Relief Fraud.
The FBI continues to remind the public to apply a
critical eye and do their due diligence before giving
contributions to anyone soliciting donations on behalf
of Haitian or Chilean victims. Solicitations can originate
from e-mails, websites, door-to-door collections,
mailings and telephone calls, and similar methods.
Therefore, before making a donation of any kind,
consumers should adhere to certain guidelines, including
the following:
• Do not respond to any unsolicited (spam)
incoming e-mails, including clicking links

•

•

•

•
•

•
•
•
•

contained within those messages because they
may contain computer viruses.
Be skeptical of individuals representing
themselves as surviving victims or officials asking
for donations via e-mail or social networking sites.
Beware of organizations with copy-cat names
similar to but not exactly the same as those of
reputable charities.
Rather than following a purported link to a
website, verify the legitimacy of non-profit
organizations by utilizing various Internet-based
resources that may assist in confirming the group’s
existence and its non-profit status.
Be cautious of e-mails that claim to show pictures
of the disaster areas in attached files, because the
files may contain viruses. Only open attachments
from known senders.
To ensure contributions are received and used for
intended purposes, make contributions directly to
known organizations rather than relying on others
to make the donation on your behalf.
Do not be pressured into making contributions, as
reputable charities do not use such tactics.
Do not give your personal or financial information
to anyone who solicits contributions. Providing
such information may compromise your identity
and make you vulnerable to identity theft.
Avoid cash donations if possible. Pay by debit or
credit card, or write a check directly to the charity.
Do not make checks payable to individuals.
Legitimate charities do not normally solicit
donations via money transfer services.
Most legitimate charities websites end in .org
rather than .com.
There are scams targeting Haitian immigrants and
their families offering assistance in getting family
members and friends out of Haiti. These individuals
charge a fee and then claim they will provide the
necessary immigration paperwork or an airline
ticket for disaster victims to leave Haiti. For official
information pertaining to immigration from Haiti to
the U.S., visit the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration
Services (USCIS) website at www.USCIS.gov.

If you believe you have been a victim of fraud from
a person or an organization soliciting relief funds on
behalf of Haitian or Chilean earthquake victims, contact
the National Center for Disaster Fraud at (866) 7205721. You can also fax information to (225) 334-4707 or
e-mail it to disaster@leo.gov.

Rental and Real Estate Scams
Source: IC3
Date: March 11, 2010

Individuals need to be cautious when posting rental
properties and real estate on-line. IC3 continues to
receive numerous complaints from individuals who have
fallen victim to scams involving rentals of apartments
and houses, as well as postings of real estate on-line.
Rental scams occur when the victim has rental property
advertised and is contacted by an interested party. Once
the rental price is agreed-upon, the scammer forwards a
check for the deposit on the rental property to the victim.
The check is to cover housing expenses and is, either
written in excess of the amount required, with the scammer
asking for the remainder to be remitted back, or the check
is written for the correct amount, but the scammer backs
out of the rental agreement and asks for a refund. Since the
banks do not usually place a hold on the funds, the victim
has immediate access to them and believes the check has
cleared. In the end, the check is found to be counterfeit and
the victim is held responsible by the bank for all losses.
Another type of scam involves real estate that is posted
via classified advertisement websites. The scammer
duplicates postings from legitimate real estate websites
and reposts these ads, after altering them. Often, the
scammers use the broker’s real name to create a fake
email, which gives the fraud more legitimacy. When
the victim sends an email through the classified
advertisement website inquiring about the home, they
receive a response from someone claiming to be the
owner. The “owner” claims he and his wife are currently
on missionary work in a foreign country. Therefore, he
needs someone to rent their home while they are away.
If the victim is interested in renting the home, they are
asked to send money to the owner in the foreign country.

The FBI determined fraudsters compromised victim
accounts and contacted financial institutions to change
the victim profile information (i.e., email addresses,
telephone numbers and bank account numbers).
The TDoS attacks used automated dialing programs
and multiple accounts to overwhelm victims’ cell
phones and land lines with thousands of calls. When
victims answered the calls they heard dead air (nothing
on the other end), an innocuous recorded message,
advertisement, or a telephone sex menu. Calls were
typically short in duration but so numerous that victims
changed their phone numbers to terminate the attack.
These TDoS attacks were used as a diversion to prevent
financial and brokerage institutions from verifying victim
account changes and transactions. Fraudsters were
afforded adequate time to transfer funds from victim
brokerage and financial online accounts.
Protection from TDoS attacks and other types of fraud
requires consumers to be vigilant and proactive. In
Newark’s Public Service Announcement (PSA), they
recommend consumers protect themselves by:
•

•
•

Implement security measures for all financial
accounts by placing fraud alerts with the major
credit bureaus if you believe they were targeted by
a TDOS attack or other forms of fraud.
Use strong passwords for all financial accounts
and change them regularly.
Obtain and review your annual credit report for
fraudulent activity.

If you were a target of a TDoS attack, immediately contact
your financial institutions, notify your telephone provider,
and promptly report it to IC3 website at: www.ic3.gov.
The IC3 complaint database links complaints to assist in
referrals to the appropriate law enforcement agency for
case consideration. The complaint information is also used
to identity emerging trends and patterns.

If you have been a victim of Internet crime, please file a
complaint at http://www.ic3.gov/.

attacks please refer to the FBI Newark Division, PSA dated

out of thousands of dollars. Portraying to be the victim,
the hacker uses the victim’s account to send a notice
to their contacts. The notice claims the victim is in
immediate need of money due to being robbed of their
credit cards, passport, money, and cell phone; leaving
them stranded in London or some other location. Some
claim they only have a few days to pay their hotel bill
and promise to reimburse upon their return home. A
sense of urgency to help their friend/contact may cause
the recipient to fail to validate the claim, increasing the
likelihood of them falling for this scam.
If you receive a similar notice and are not sure it is a
scam, you should always verify the information before
sending any money.
If you have been a victim of this type of scam or any other

Fraudulent Notifications Deceive Consumers Out
of Thousands of Dollars
Source: IC3
Date: November 8, 2010

IC3 continues to receive reports of letters and emails
being distributed as part of a prize sweepstakes or
lottery scheme. The scheme uses fraudulent checks
bearing the logos of various financial institutions.
Individuals are informed they won a sweepstakes or
lottery and will receive a lump sum payout if they pay
taxes and processing fees upfront. The communication
directs individuals to call a telephone number to
secure their unclaimed prize, and receive instructions
for paying the upfront taxes and fees. A fraudulent
check is enclosed with the letter, or sent after the
initial call, in the amount of the supposed taxes. The
instructions inform the individual to cash the check
and wire the proceeds, in order to receive the payout.
Following these instructions leaves the victim liable
for the amount of the counterfeit check, plus any
additional fees charged by their bank. Recipients of the
communication may fall victim to the scheme due to
the allure of easy money and the apparent legitimacy of
the check. The alleged cash prizes and locations of the
financial institutions vary.
If you receive a similar notice you should always verify
the information before sending any money.

Tips to avoid being scammed:
•
•
•
•

A federal statute prohibits mailing lottery tickets,
advertisements, or payments to purchase tickets in a
foreign lottery.
Be leery if you do not remember entering a lottery
or sweepstakes.
Beware of lotteries or sweepstakes that charge a fee
prior to delivery of your prize.
Be wary of demands to send additional money to be
eligible for future winnings.

If you have been a victim of this type of scam or any
other cyber crime, you can report it to the IC3 website
at: www.ic3.gov. The IC3 complaint database links
complaints for potential referral to law enforcement for

Telephone Collection Scams Related to Delinquent
Payday Loans
Source: IC3
Date: December 1, 2010

IC3 receives a high volume of complaints from victims
of payday loan telephone collection scams. In these
scams, a caller claims that the victim is delinquent in
a payday loan and must repay the loan to avoid legal
consequences. The callers purport to be representatives
of the FBI, Federal Legislative Department, various
law firms, or other legitimate-sounding agencies. They
claim to be collecting debts for companies such as
United Cash Advance, U.S. Cash Advance, U.S. Cash
Net, and other internet check cashing services.
One of the most insidious aspects of this scam is
that the callers have accurate information about the
victims, including social security numbers, dates of
birth, addresses, employer information, bank account
numbers, names and telephone numbers of relatives and
friends. The method by which the fraudsters obtained
the personal information is unclear, but victims often
relay that they had completed online applications for
other loans or credit cards before the calls began.
The fraudsters relentlessly call the victim’s home,
cell phone, and place of employment. They refuse to
provide to the victims any details of the alleged payday
loans and become abusive when questioned. The callers
threaten victims with legal actions, arrests, and in
some cases physical violence if they refuse to pay. In
many cases, the callers even resort to harassment of the
victim’s relatives, friends, and employers.

2010 Internet Crime Report | 17

Some fraudsters instruct victims to fax a statement
agreeing to pay a certain dollar amount, on a specific
date, via prepaid visa card. The statement further
declares that the victim would never dispute the debt.
THESE TELEPHONE CALLS ARE AN ATTEMPT TO
OBTAIN PAYMENT BY INSTILLING FEAR IN THE
VICTIMS. DO NOT FOLLOW THE INSTUCTIONS
OF THE CALLER.
If you receive telephone calls such as these, you should:
•
•
•
•

Contact your banking institutions;
Contact the three major credit bureaus and request
an alert be put on your file;
Contact your local law enforcement agencies if you
feel you are in immediate danger;
File a complaint at www.ic3.gov.
