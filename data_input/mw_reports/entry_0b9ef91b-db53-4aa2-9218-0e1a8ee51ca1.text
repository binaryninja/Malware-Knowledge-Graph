By Claire Zaboeva co-authored by Melissa Frydrych 6 min read
At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, IBM Security X-Force created a threat intelligence
task force dedicated to tracking down COVID-19 cyber threats against organizations that are
keeping the vaccine supply chain moving. As part of these efforts, our team recently
uncovered a global phishing campaign targeting organizations associated with a COVID-19
cold chain. The cold chain is a component of the vaccine supply chain that ensures the safe
preservation of vaccines in temperature-controlled environments during their storage and
transportation.
Our analysis indicates that this calculated operation started in September 2020. The COVID19 phishing campaign spanned across six countries and targeted organizations likely
associated with Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance’s Cold Chain Equipment Optimization Platform
(CCEOP) program, which we explain further in this blog. While firm attribution could not be
established for this campaign, the precision targeting of executives and key global
organizations hold the potential hallmarks of nation-state tradecraft.
Some details from IBM Security X-Force’s analysis of this activity include:
The Cover Story — The adversary impersonated a business executive from Haier
Biomedical, a credible and legitimate member company of the COVID-19 vaccine
supply chain and qualified supplier for the CCEOP program. The company is
purportedly the world’s only complete cold chain provider. Disguised as this employee,
the adversary sent phishing emails to organizations believed to be providers of material
support to meet transportation needs within the COVID-19 cold chain. We assess that
the purpose of this COVID-19 phishing campaign may have been to harvest
credentials, possibly to gain future unauthorized access to corporate networks and
sensitive information relating to the COVID-19 vaccine distribution.
The Targets — The targets included the European Commission’s Directorate-General
for Taxation and Customs Union, as well as organizations within the energy,
manufacturing, website creation and software and internet security solutions sectors.
These are global organizations headquartered in Germany, Italy, South Korea, Czech
Republic, greater Europe and Taiwan.
The How — Spear-phishing emails were sent to select executives in sales,
procurement, information technology and finance positions, likely involved in company
efforts to support a vaccine cold chain. We also identified instances where this activity
extended organization-wide to include help and support pages of targeted
organizations.
IBM Security X-Force has followed responsible disclosure protocols and notified the
appropriate entities and authorities about this targeted operation.

Alert for the COVID-19 Supply Chain

2/10

IBM Security X-Force urges companies in the COVID-19 supply chain — from research of
therapies, healthcare delivery to distribution of a vaccine — to be vigilant and remain on high
alert during this time. Governments have already warned that foreign entities are likely to
attempt to conduct cyber espionage to steal information about vaccines. Today, in
conjunction with this blog, DHS CISA is issuing an alert encouraging organizations
associated with the storage and transport of a vaccine to review this research and
recommended best practices to remain vigilant.

Calculated Spoofing to Compromise the COVID-19 Cold Chain
IBM Security X-Force uncovered targets across multiple industries, governments and global
partners that support the CCEOP program. The CCEOP was launched by Gavi, The Vaccine
Alliance along with the United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF) and other partners in 2015.
Its objective is to ultimately strengthen vaccine supply chains, optimize immunization equity
and ensure an agile medical response to outbreaks of infectious diseases. Various classes of
medication, and especially vaccines, require storage and transport in temperature-controlled
environments to ensure their safe preservation.
The CCEOP initiative is naturally accelerating efforts to facilitate the distribution of a COVID19 vaccine. A breach within any part of this global alliance could result in the exposure of
numerous partner computing environments worldwide.
The spoofed phishing emails appear to originate from a business executive from Haier
Biomedical, a Chinese company currently acting as a qualified supplier for the CCEOP
program, in coordination with the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and other U.N.
agencies. It is highly likely that the adversary strategically chose to impersonate Haier
Biomedical because it is purported to be the world’s only complete cold chain provider.
Likewise, the Haier Biomedical employee who is purported to be sending these emails would
likely be associated with Haier Biomedical’s cold chain distribution operations based on his
role, which is listed in the email signature block.
It’s unclear from our analysis if the COVID-19 phishing campaign was successful. However,
the established role that Haier Biomedical currently plays in vaccine transport, and their likely
role in COVID-19 vaccine distribution, increases the probability the intended targets may
engage with the inbound emails without questioning the sender’s authenticity.

Credential Harvesting for Wider Access
The subject of the phishing emails posed as requests for quotations (RFQ) related to the
CCEOP program. The emails contain malicious HTML attachments that open locally,
prompting recipients to enter their credentials to view the file. This phishing technique helps
attackers avoid setting up phishing pages online that can be discovered and taken down by
security research teams and law enforcement.

3/10

We assess that the purpose of this campaign may have been to harvest credentials to gain
future unauthorized access. From there, the adversary could gain insight into internal
communications, as well as the process, methods and plans to distribute a COVID-19
vaccine. This includes information regarding infrastructure that governments intend to use to
distribute a vaccine to the vendors that will be supplying it. However, beyond critical
information pertaining to the COVID-19 vaccine, the adversary’s access could extend deeper
into victim environments. Moving laterally through networks and remaining there in stealth
would allow them to conduct cyber espionage and collect additional confidential information
from the victim environments for future operations.

supply chain.

Global Targeting
Given the specialization and global distribution of organizations targeted in this campaign, it’s
highly likely that the adversary is intimately aware of critical components and participants of
the cold chain.
European Commission’s Directorate-General for Taxation and Customs Union
— The Directorate-General is responsible for promoting cooperation on customs and
tax matters across the EU. It maintains direct ties to multiple national government
networks and is associated with trade and regulation. Targeting this entity could serve
as a single point of compromise impacting multiple high-value targets across the 27
member states of the European Union and beyond.

4/10

Energy Sector — Spear phishing targets included companies involved in
manufacturing solar panels. One of the ways that vaccines are kept cold in countries
where reliable power is not possible is by using vaccine refrigerators powered by solar
panels. A compromise of such technologies could result in intellectual property theft or
stealing and selling vaccine shipping containers in black markets across the globe.
Targeting also included companies associated with petrochemicals. Among the key
components of cold chain is the use of dry ice, which is a byproduct of petroleum
production.
IT Sector — Amongst the targets were a South Korean software development firm and
a German website development company. The latter supports multiple clients
associated with pharmaceutical manufacturers, container transport, biotechnology and
manufacturers of electrical components enabling sea, land and air navigation and
communications.

Who is Likely Behind These Attacks?
While attribution is currently unknown, the precision targeting and nature of the specific
targeted organizations potentially point to nation-state activity. Without a clear path to a cashout, cyber criminals are unlikely to devote the time and resources required to execute such a
calculated operation with so many interlinked and globally distributed targets. Likewise,
insight into the transport of a vaccine may present a hot black-market commodity, however,
advanced insight into the purchase and movement of a vaccine that can impact life and the
global economy is likely a high-value and high-priority nation-state target.
Earlier in 2020, IBM Security X-Force uncovered activity surrounding the targeting of a global
COVID-19 PPE supply chain. Similarly, as the global competition races for a vaccine, it is
highly likely the cold chain is a compelling target that will be at the top of the lists of national
collection requirements worldwide.

Recommendations to Defenders
IBM Security X-Force stands ready to host the COVID-19 supply chain community on our
Enterprise Intelligence Management platform, where they can share threat information and
take action on the latest threat intelligence. The following are recommendations for
organizations to increase their cyber readiness amidst the developments outlined in this
blog:
Create and test incident response plans to strengthen your organization’s
preparedness and readiness to respond in the event of an attack.

5/10

Share and ingest threat intelligence. Threat-sharing initiatives and partnerships are
essential to staying alert about the latest threats and attack tactics impacting your
industry. IBM Security X-Force has been feeding this threat intelligence into the
COVID-19 threat sharing enclave. At the onset of the pandemic, IBM made this
enclave freely accessible to any organization in need of more eyes on cyber threats.
Assess your third-party ecosystem and assess potential risks introduced by thirdparty partners. Confirm you have robust monitoring, access controls and security
standards in place that third-party partners need to abide by.
Apply a zero-trust approach to your security strategy. As environments continue to
expand, managing privilege access becomes paramount to ensuring that users are
only granted access to the data that is essential to their job.
Use Multifactor Authentication (MFA) across your organization. MFA works as a
fail-safe if a malicious actor has gained access to your credentials. As a last line of
defense, MFA offers a second form of verification requirement in order to access an
account.
Conduct regular email security educational trainings so employees remain on alert
about phishing tactics and are familiar with email security best practices.
Use Endpoint Protection and Response tools to more readily detect and prevent
threats from spreading across the organization.
If your organization requires immediate assistance with incident response, please contact
