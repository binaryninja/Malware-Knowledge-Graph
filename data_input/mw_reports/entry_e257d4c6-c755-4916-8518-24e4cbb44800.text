Summary
In the last 3 months, we have noticed increased activity from APT36, a Pakistan-linked
Cyber Threat actor. The target this time are personnel belonging to defence organizations
& other Government organizations in India.
In the recent wave of attacks, APT36 is using honey trapping technique to lure their
targets. The “honey trap” operations use fake profiles of attractive women to entice
targets into opening their emails or chatting over messaging platforms, ultimately leading
them into downloading malware.
Some of the attachment names that we found in the current themed attack:

When target opens such attachment, it drops MSIL based Crimson RAT which has been
used by APT36 in many of their past attacks. This RAT is used for data-stealing activities
and sending them to a CnC server.

Operation ‘Honey Trap’
Indian Army has described ‘honey trap’ cases as a weapon of hybrid warfare being waged
by the enemy across the borders. The same theme is now being used by APT36 to lure its
targets.

This campaign continues to use two separate infection chains. These two infection
techniques of APT36 have remained the same in the past couple of years.
In the first chain, a spear-phishing email has a macro loaded document as an attachment.
This document is responsible to execute a dropper module that starts the Crimson RAT
tool to perform malicious activity.

In the second chain, a spear-phishing email attachment directly contains a dropper
module within a zip file. This dropper component opens a decoy document for the victim
and runs Crimson RAT tool in the background to perform malicious activity.

The second infection chain is not so successful in organizations as their firewalls usually
block ‘EXE’ filetype within an email. This is the main reason, it is targeting personal
accounts of individuals related to the Indian Defence sector.

Conclusion
It is a well-established fact, that APT36 targets defence and other critical sector
organizations. Usually, their targets are individuals and organizations which are of
strategic interest to India’s western neighbour. However, in this campaign, interestingly,

some of the targeted entities belong to organizations based in the eastern states in India!
