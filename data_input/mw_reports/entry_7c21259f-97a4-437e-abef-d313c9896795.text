For two years, the Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) at Kaspersky has been
publishing quarterly summaries of advanced persistent threat (APT) activity. The summaries
are based on our threat intelligence research and provide a representative snapshot of what
we have published and discussed in greater detail in our private APT reports. They aim to
highlight the significant events and findings that we feel people should be aware of.
This is our latest installment, focusing on activities that we observed during Q2 2019.
Readers who would like to learn more about our intelligence reports or request more
information on a specific report are encouraged to contact ‘intelreports@kaspersky.com’.

The most remarkable findings
1/12

In April, we published our report on TajMahal, a previously unknown APT framework that has
been active for the last five years. This is a highly sophisticated spyware framework that
includes backdoors, loaders, orchestrators, C2 communicators, audio recorders, keyloggers,
screen and webcam grabbers, documents, and cryptography key stealers; and even its own
file indexer for the victim’s computer. We discovered up to 80 malicious modules stored in its
encrypted Virtual File System – one of the highest numbers of plugins we have ever seen in
an APT toolset. The malware features its own indexer, emergency C2s, the ability to steal
specific files from external drives when they become available again, and much more. There
are two different packages, self-named ‘Tokyo’ and ‘Yokohama’ and the targeted computers
we found include both packages. We think the attackers used Tokyo as the first stage
infection, deploying the fully functional Yokohama package on interesting victims, and then
leaving Tokyo in place for backup purposes. So far, our telemetry has revealed just a single
victim, a diplomatic body from a country in Central Asia. This begs the question, why go to all
that trouble for just one victim? We think there may be other victims that we haven’t found
yet. This theory is supported by the fact that we couldn’t see how one of the files in the VFS
was used by the malware, opening the door to the possibility of additional versions of the
malware that have yet to be detected.
On May 14, FT reported that a zero-day vulnerability in WhatsApp had been exploited,
allowing attackers to eavesdrop on users, read their encrypted chats, turn on the microphone
and camera and install spyware that allows even further surveillance, such as browsing
through a victim’s photos and videos, accessing their contact list and more. In order to
exploit the vulnerability, the attacker simply needs to call the victim via WhatsApp. This
specially crafted call can trigger a buffer overflow in WhatsApp, allowing an attacker to take
control of the application and execute arbitrary code in it. Apparently, the attackers used this
method to not only snoop on people’s chats and calls but also to exploit previously unknown
vulnerabilities in the operating system, which allowed them to install applications on the
device. The vulnerability affects WhatsApp for Android prior to 2.19.134, WhatsApp Business
for Android prior to 2.19.44, WhatsApp for iOS prior to 2.19.51, WhatsApp Business for iOS
prior to 2.19.51, WhatsApp for Windows Phone prior to 2.18.348 and WhatsApp for Tizen
prior to 2.18.15. WhatsApp released patches for the vulnerability on May 13. Some have
suggested that the spyware may be Pegasus, developed by Israeli company NSO.

Russian-speaking activity
We continue to track the activities of Russian-speaking APT groups. These groups usually
show a particular interest in political activities, but apart from a couple of interesting
exceptions we failed to detect any remarkable examples during the last quarter.
We did find a potential connection between Hades and a leak at the RANA institute. Hades is
possibly connected to the Sofacy threat actor, most notable for being behind Olympic
Destroyer, as well as ExPetr and several disinformation campaigns such as the Macron

2/12

leaks. Earlier this year, a website named Hidden Reality published leaks allegedly related to
an Iranian entity named the RANA institute. This was the third leak in two months that
disclosed details of alleged Iranian threat actors and groups. Close analysis of the materials,
the infrastructure and the dedicated website used by those behind the leak led us to believe
that these leaks might be connected to Hades. This might be part of a disinformation
campaign in which Hades helps to raise doubts about the quality of the information leaked in
other cases from earlier this year.
Zebrocy continued adding new tools to its arsenal using various kinds of programming
languages. We found Zebrocy deploying a compiled Python script, which we call
PythocyDbg, within a Southeast Asian foreign affairs organization: this module primarily
provides for the stealthy collection of network proxy and communications debug capabilities.
In early 2019, Zebrocy shifted its development efforts with the use of Nimrod/Nim, a
programming language with syntax resembling both Pascal and Python that can be compiled
down to JavaScript or C targets. Both the Nim downloaders that the group mainly uses for
spear-phishing, and other Nim backdoor code, are currently being produced by Zebrocy and
delivered alongside updated compiled AutoIT scripts, Go, and Delphi modules. The targets
of this new Nimcy downloader and backdoor set includes diplomats, defense officials and
ministry of foreign affairs staff, from whom they want to steal login credentials, keystrokes,
communications, and various files. The group appears to have turned its attention towards
the March events involving Pakistan and India, and unrelated diplomatic and military officials,
while maintaining ongoing access to local and remote networks belonging to Central Asian
governments.
We also recently observed some interesting new artifacts that we relate to Turla with varying
degrees of confidence.
In April 2019, we observed a new COMpfun-related targeted campaign using new malware.
The Kaspersky Attribution Engine shows strong code similarities between the new family and
the old COMpfun. Moreover, the original COMpfun is used as a downloader in one of the
spreading mechanisms. We called the newly identified modules Reductor after a .pdb path
left in some samples. We believe the malware was developed by the same COMPfun
authors that, internally, we tentatively associated with the Turla APT, based on victimology.
Besides the typical RAT functions (upload, download, execute files), Reductor’s authors put
a lot of effort into manipulating installed digital root certificates and marking outbound TLS
traffic with unique host-related identifiers. The malware adds embedded root certificates to
the target host and allows operators to add additional ones remotely through a named pipe.
The solution used by Reductor’s developers to mark TLS traffic is the most ingenious part.
The authors don’t touch the network packets at all; instead they analyze Firefox source and
Chrome binary code to patch the corresponding system pseudo-random number generation
(PRNG) functions in the process’s memory. Browsers use PRNG to generate the “client

3/12

random” sequence during the very beginning of the TLS handshake. Reductor adds the
victims’ unique encrypted hardware- and software-based identifiers to this “client random”
field.
Additionally we identified a new backdoor that we attribute with medium confidence to Turla.
The backdoor, named Tunnus, is .NET-based malware with the ability to run commands or
perform file actions on an infected system and send the results to its C2. So far, the C2
infrastructure has been built using compromised sites with vulnerable WordPress
installations. According to our telemetry, Tunnus’s activity started last March and was still
active at the time of writing.
ESET has also reported PowerShell scripts being used by Turla to provide direct, in-memory
loading and execution of malware. This is not the first time this threat actor has used
PowerShell in this way, but the group has improved these scripts and is now using them to
load a wide range of custom malware from its traditional arsenal. The payloads delivered via
the PowerShell scripts – the RPC backdoor and PowerStallion – are highly customized.
Symantec has also been tracking targeted attacks in a series of campaigns against
governments and international organizations across the globe over the past 18 months. The
attacks have featured a rapidly evolving toolset and, in one notable instance, the apparent
hijacking of infrastructure belonging to OilRig. They have uncovered evidence that the
Waterbug APT group (aka Turla, Snake, Uroburos, Venomous Bear and KRYPTON) has
conducted a hostile takeover of an attack platform belonging to OilRig (aka Crambus).
Researchers at Symantec suspect that Turla used the hijacked network to attack a Middle
Eastern government that OilRig had already penetrated. This is not the first time that we
have seen this type of activity. Clearly, operations of this kind make the job of attribution
more difficult.
The international community continues to focus on the activity of Russian-speaking threat
actors. Over the last 18 months, the UK has shared information on attacks attributed to
Russian hackers with 16 NATO allies, including attacks on critical national infrastructure and
attempts to compromise central government networks. In his former capacity as UK foreign
secretary, Jeremy Hunt, recently urged nations to band together to create a deterrent for
state-sponsored hackers. As part of this push, the UK and its intelligence partners have been
slowly moving towards a ‘name and shame’ approach when dealing with cyberattacks. The
use of the ‘court of public opinion’ in response to cyberattacks is a trend that we highlighted
in our predictions for 2019. To help this new strategy the EU recently passed new laws that
will make it possible for EU member states to impose economic sanctions against foreign
hackers.
Researchers at the Microstep Intelligence Bureau have published a report on targeted
attacks on the Ukrainian government that they attribute to the Gamaredon threat actor.
Recently, the group launched attacks on a number of state organizations in Ukraine using
4/12

Pterodo, malware used exclusively by this group. Since February, the attackers have
deployed a large number of dynamic domain names and newly registered domain names
believed to be used to launch targeted attacks against elections in Ukraine.

Chinese-speaking activity
We found an active campaign by a Chinese APT group we call SixLittleMonkeys that uses a
new version of the Microcin Trojan and a RAT that we call HawkEye as a last stager. The
campaign mainly targets government bodies in Central Asia. For persistence, the operators
use .DLL search order hijacking. This consists of using a custom decryptor with a system
library name (e.g., version.dll or api-ms-win-core-fibers-l1-1-1.dll) in directories, along with
the legitimate applications that load these libraries into memory. Among other legitimate
applications, the threat actor uses the Google updater, GoogleCrashHandler.exe, for .DLL
hijacking. Custom encryptors protect the next stagers from detection on disk and from
automated analysis, using the same encryption keys in different samples. For secure TLS
communication with its C2, the malware uses the Secure Channel (Schannel) Windows
security package.
ESET discovered that the attackers behind the Plead malware have been distributing it using
compromised routers and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks in April. Researchers have
detected this activity in Taiwan, where the Plead malware has been most actively deployed.
Trend Micro has previously reported the use of this malware in targeted attacks by the
BlackTech group, primarily focused on cyber-espionage in Asia. ESET telemetry has
revealed multiple attempts to deploy it.
LuckyMouse activity detected by Palo Alto involved the attackers installing web shells on
SharePoint servers to compromise government organizations in the Middle East, probably
exploiting CVE-2019-0604, a remote code execution vulnerability used to compromise the
server and eventually install a web shell. The actors uploaded a variety of tools that they
used to perform additional activities on the compromised network, such as dumping
credentials, as well as locating and pivoting to additional systems on the network. Of
particular note is the group’s use of tools to identify systems vulnerable to CVE-2017-0144,
the vulnerability exploited by EternalBlue and used in the 2017 WannaCry attacks. This
activity appears to be related to campaigns exploiting CVE-2019-0604 mentioned in recent
security alerts from the Saudi Arabian National Cyber Security Center and the Canadian
Center for Cyber Security.
Last year, a number of Chinese hackers allegedly linked to the Chinese government were
indicted in the US. In May, the US Department of Justice indicted a Chinese national for a
series of computer intrusions, including the 2015 data breach of health insurance company
Anthem which affected more than 78 million people.

Middle East
5/12

The last three months have been very interesting for this region, especially considering the
multiple leaks of alleged Iranian activity that were published within just a few weeks of each
other. Even more interesting is the possibility that one of the leaks may have been part of a
disinformation campaign carried out with the help of the Sofacy/Hades actor.
In March, someone going by the handle Dookhtegan or Lab_dookhtegan started posting
messages on Twitter using the hashtag #apt34. Several files were shared via Telegram that
supposedly belonged to the OilRig threat actor. They included logins and passwords of
several alleged hacking victims, tools, infrastructure details potentially related to different
intrusions, the résumés of the alleged attackers and a list of web shells – apparently relating
to the period 2014-18.
The targeting and TTPs are consistent with this threat actor, but it was impossible to confirm
the origins of the tools included in the dump. Assuming that the data in the dump is accurate,
it also shows the global reach of the OilRig group, which has generally been thought to
operate primarily in the Middle East.
On April 22, an entity going by the alias Bl4ck_B0X created a Telegram channel named
GreenLeakers. The purpose of the channel, as stated by its creator, was to publish
information about the members of the MuddyWater APT group, “along with information about
their mother and spouse and etc.”, for free. In addition to this free information, the Bl4ck_B0X
actor(s) also hinted that “highly confidential” information related to MuddyWater would be put
up for sale.
On April 27, three screenshots were posted in the GreenLeakers Telegram channel,
containing alleged screenshots from a MuddyWater C2 server. On May 1, the channel was
closed to the public and its status changed to private. This was before Bl4ck_B0X had the
chance to publish the promised information on the MuddyWater group. The reason for the
closure is still unclear.
Finally, a website named Hidden Reality published leaks allegedly related to an entity named
the Iranian RANA institute. It was the third leak in two months disclosing details of alleged
Iranian threat actors and groups.
Interestingly, this leak differed from the others by employing a website that allows anyone to
browse the leaked documents. It also relies on Telegram and Twitter profiles to post
messages related to Iranian CNO capabilities. The Hidden Reality website contains internal
documents, chat messages and other data related to the RANA institute’s CNO (Computer
Network Operations) capabilities, as well as information about victims. Previous leaks were
focused more on tools, source code and individual actor profiles.

6/12

Close analysis of the materials, the infrastructure and the dedicated website used by the
leakers, provided clues that led us to believe Sofacy/Hades may be connected to these
leaks.
There was also other Muddywater activity unrelated to the leak, as well as discoveries linked
to previous activity by the group, such as ClearSky’s discovery of two domains hacked by
MuddyWater at the end of 2018 to host the code of its POWERSTATS malware.
In April, Cisco Talos published its analysis of the BlackWater campaign, related to
MuddyWater activity. The campaign shows how the attackers added three distinct steps to
their operations, allowing them to bypass certain security controls to evade detection: an
obfuscated VBA script to establish persistence as a registry key, a PowerShell stager and
FruityC2 agent script, and an open source framework on GitHub to further enumerate the
host machine. This could allow the attackers to monitor web logs and determine whether
someone outside the campaign has made a request to their server in an attempt to
investigate the activity. Once the enumeration commands run, the agent communicates with
a different C2 and sends back data in the URL field. Trend Micro also reported
MuddyWater’s use of a new multi-stage PowerShell-based backdoor called POWERSTATS
v3.
We published a private report about four Android malware families and their use of false flag
techniques, among other things. One of the campaigns sent spear-phishing emails to a
university in Jordan and the Turkish government, using compromised legitimate accounts to
trick victims into installing malware.
Regarding other groups, we discovered new activity related to ZooPark, a cyber-espionage
threat actor that has focused mainly on stealing data from Android devices. Our new findings
include new malicious samples and additional infrastructure that has been deployed since
2016. This also led to us discovering Windows malware implants deployed by the same
threat actor. The additional indicators we found shed some light on the targets of past
campaigns, including Iranian Kurds – mainly political dissidents and activists.
Recorded Future published an analysis of the infrastructure built by APT33 (aka Elfin) to
target Saudi organizations. Following the exposure of a wide range of their infrastructure and
operations by Symantec in March, researchers at Recorded Future discovered that APT33,
or closely aligned actors, reacted by either parking or reassigning some of their domain
infrastructure. The fact that this activity was executed just a day or so after the report went
live suggests the Iranian threat actors are acutely aware of the media coverage of their
activities and are resourceful enough to be able to react in a quick manner. Since then, the
attackers have continued to use a large swath of operational infrastructure, well in excess of
1,200 domains, with many observed communicating with 19 different commodity RAT

7/12

implants. An interesting development appears to be their increased preference for njRAT,
with over half of the observed suspected APT33 infrastructure being linked to njRAT
deployment.
On a more political level, there were several news stories covering Iranian activity.
A group connected to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard has been blamed for a wave of cyberattacks against UK national infrastructure, including the Post Office, local government
networks, private companies and banks. Personal data of thousands of employees were
stolen. It is believed that the same group was also responsible for the attack on the UK
parliamentary network in 2017. The UK NCSC (National Cyber Security Centre) is providing
assistance to affected organizations.
Microsoft recently obtained a court order in the US to seize control of 99 websites used by
the Iranian hacking group APT35 (aka Phosphorus and Charming Kitten). The threat actor
used spoofed websites, including those of Microsoft and Yahoo, to conduct cyberattacks
against businesses, government agencies, journalists and activists who focus on Iran. The
sinkholing of these sites will force the group to recreate part of its infrastructure.
The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has reported an increase in
cyberattacks by Iranian actors or proxies, targeting US industries and government agencies
using destructive wiper tools. The statement was posted on Twitter by CISA director, Chris
Krebs.

Southeast Asia and Korean Peninsula
This quarter we detected a lot of Korean-related activity. However, for the rest of the
Southeast Asian region there has not been that much activity, especially when compared to
earlier periods.
Early in Q2, we identified an interesting Lazarus attack targeting a mobile gaming company
in South Korea that we believe was aimed at stealing application source code. It’s clear that
Lazarus keeps updating its tools very quickly. Meanwhile, BlueNoroff, the Lazarus sub-group
that typically targets financial institutions, targeted a bank in Central Asia and a cryptocurrency business in China.
In a recent campaign, we observed ScarCruft using a multi-stage binary to infect several
victims and ultimately install a final payload known as ROKRAT – a cloud service-based
backdoor. ScarCruft is a highly skilled APT group, historically using geo-political issues to
target the Korean Peninsula. We found several victims worldwide identified as companies
and individuals with ties to North Korea, as well as a diplomatic agency. Interestingly, we
observed that ScarCruft continues to adopt publicly available exploit code in its tools. We
also found an interesting overlap in a Russian-based victim targeted both by ScarCruft and
DarkHotel – not the first time that we have seen such an overlap.
8/12

ESET recently analyzed a new Mac OS sample from the OceanLotus group that had been
uploaded to VirusTotal. This backdoor shares its features with a previous Mac OS variant,
but the structure has changed and detection is now much harder. Researchers were unable
to find the dropper associated with this sample, so they could not identify the initial
compromise vector.
The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has reported Trojan variants, identified as
HOPLIGHT, being used by the North Korean government. The report includes an analysis of
nine malicious executable files. Seven of them are proxy applications that mask traffic
between the malware and the remote operators. The proxies have the ability to generate
fake TLS handshake sessions using valid public SSL certificates, disguising network
connections with remote malicious actors. One file contains a public SSL certificate and the
payload of the file appears to be encoded with a password or key. The remaining file does
not contain any of the public SSL certificates, but attempts outbound connections and drops
four files: the dropped files primarily contain IP addresses and SSL certificates.
In June, we came across an unusual set of samples used to target diplomatic, government
and military organizations in countries in South and Southeast Asia. The threat actor behind
the campaign, which we believe to be the PLATINUM APT group, uses an elaborate,
previously unseen, steganographic technique to conceal communication. A couple of years
ago, we predicted that more and more APT and malware developers would use
steganography, and this campaign provides proof: the actors used two interesting
steganography techniques in this APT. It’s also interesting that the attackers decided to
implement the utilities they need as one huge set – an example of the framework-based
architecture that is becoming more and more popular.

Other interesting discoveries
On May 14, Microsoft released fixes for a critical Remote Code Execution vulnerability (CVE2019-0708) in Remote Desktop Services (formerly known as Terminal Services) that affects
some older versions of Windows: Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server
2008 and some unsupported versions of Windows – including Windows 2003 and Windows
XP. Details on how to mitigate this vulnerability are available in our private report ‘Analysis
and detection guidance for CVE-2019-0708’. The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) itself is
not vulnerable. This vulnerability is pre-authentication and requires no user interaction. In
other words, the vulnerability is ‘wormable’, meaning that any future malware that exploits
this vulnerability could propagate from vulnerable computer to vulnerable computer in a
similar way that WannaCry spread. Microsoft has not observed exploitation of this
vulnerability, but believes it is highly likely that malicious actors will write an exploit for it.
Early in June, researchers at Malwarebytes Labs observed a number of compromises on
Amazon CloudFront, a Content Delivery Network (CDN), where hosted JavaScript libraries
were tampered with and injected with web skimmers. Although attacks that involve CDNs
9/12

usually affect a large number of web properties at once via their supply chain, this isn’t
always the case. Some websites either use Amazon’s cloud infrastructure to host their own
libraries or link to code developed specifically for them and hosted on a custom AWS S3
bucket. Without properly validating externally loaded content, these sites are exposing their
users to various threats, including some that pilfer credit card data. After analyzing these
breaches, researchers found that they are a continuation of a campaign from Magecart
threat actors attempting to cast a wide net around many different CDNs. CDNs are widely
used because they provide great benefits to website owners, including optimizing load times
and cost, as well as helping with all sorts of data analytics. The sites they identified had
nothing in common other than the fact they were all using their own custom CDN to load
various libraries. In effect, the only resulting victims of a compromise on their CDN repository
would be themselves.
Dragos has reported that XENOTIME, the APT group behind the TRISIS (aka TRITON and
HatMan) attack on a Saudi Arabian petro-chemical facility in 2017, has expanded its focus
beyond the oil and gas industries. Researchers have recently seen the group probing the
networks of electric utility organizations in the US and elsewhere – perhaps as a precursor to
a dangerous attack on critical infrastructure that could potentially cause physical damage or
loss of life. Dragos first noticed the shift in targeting in late 2018; and the attacks have
continued into 2019.
We recently reported on the latest versions of FinSpy for Android and iOS, developed in mid2018. This surveillance software is sold to government and law enforcement organizations all
over the world, who use it to collect a variety of private user information on various platforms.
WikiLeaks first discovered the implants for desktop devices in 2011 and mobile implants
were discovered in 2012. Since then Kaspersky has continuously monitored the
development of this malware and the emergence of new versions in the wild. Mobile implants
for iOS and Android have almost the same functionality. They are capable of collecting
personal information such as contacts, messages, emails, calendars, GPS location, photos,
files in memory, phone call recordings and data from the most popular messengers. The
Android implant includes functionality to gain root privileges on an unrooted device by
abusing known vulnerabilities. It would seem that the iOS solution doesn’t provide infection
exploits for its customers: the product seems to be fine-tuned to clean traces of publicly
available jailbreaking tools. This might imply that physical access to the victim’s device is
required in cases where devices are not already jailbroken. The latest version includes
multiple features that we haven’t observed before. During our recent research, we detected
up-to-date versions of these implants in the wild in almost 20 countries, but the size of the
customer base would suggest that the real number of victims may be much higher.

Final thoughts

10/12

APT activity in the Middle East has been particularly interesting this quarter, not least
because of the leaks related to alleged Iranian activity. This is especially interesting because
one of those leaks might have been part of a disinformation campaign carried out with the
help of the Sofacy/Hades threat actor.
In contrast to earlier periods, when Southeast Asia was the most active region for APTs, the
activities we detected this quarter were mainly Korean-related. For the rest of the region, it
was a much quieter quarter.
Across all regions, geo-politics remains the principal driver of APT activity.
It is also clear from our FinSpy research that there is a high demand for ‘commercial’
malware from governments and law enforcement agencies.
One of the most noteworthy aspects of the APT threat landscape we reported this quarter
was our discovery of TajMahal, a previously unknown and technically sophisticated APT
framework that has been in development for at least five years. This full-blown spying
framework includes up to 80 malicious modules stored in its encrypted Virtual File System –
one of the highest numbers of plugins we’ve ever seen for an APT toolset.
As always, we would note that our reports are the product of our visibility into the threat
landscape. However, it needs to be borne in mind that, while we strive to continually improve,
there is always the possibility that other sophisticated attacks may fly under our radar.
