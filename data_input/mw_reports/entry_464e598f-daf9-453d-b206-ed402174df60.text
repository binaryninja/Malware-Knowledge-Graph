3. Context Identifies new AVIVORE threat group
03 Oct 2019
The Threat Intelligence and Incident Response Team at Context Information Security has
identified a new threat group behind a series of incidents targeted at the aerospace and
defence industries in the UK and Europe. Named by Context as AVIVORE, the group is not
previously publicly known or reported and Context believes it is responsible for the recently
reported attacks within the aerospace and defence supply chain.
Context has been investigating attacks against large multinational firms that compromise
smaller engineering services and consultancy companies in the supply chain for more than
12 months. The attackers use legitimate remote connectivity or other collaborative working
solutions to bypass the generally well-defended perimeters and gain access to the target.
This technique, referred to as ‘Island Hopping’, has also seen the adversary leverage
chains of activity or connections across multiple business units or geographical locations
within victim environments.
As a result of its discoveries, Context has been working closely with victims, security
organisations and law enforcement agencies across Europe, including the UK’s National
Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), in order to reduce the impact and prevent further
compromises. In addition to aerospace and defence engineering victims, Context has seen
AVIVORE target assets related to other verticals including automotive, consultancy,
energy/nuclear and space and satellite technology. Context also assesses with moderate
confidence that the objective of the campaign is intellectual property theft.
“Previous reporting into recent incidents affecting aerospace and defence have linked this
activity to APT10 and JSSD (Jiangsu Province Ministry of State Security). Though the
nature of the activity makes attribution challenging, our experience of the campaign
suggests a new group that we have codenamed AVIVORE,” said Oliver Fay, Principal
Threat Intelligence Analyst at Context.
Whilst AVIVORE has been observed operating in the UTC+8 timezone and makes use of
the PlugX Remote Access Trojan shared with APT10 and other actors, the Tactics,
Techniques and Procedures (TTPs), infrastructure and other tooling differ significantly. This
1/3

leads Context to believe that this activity is attributed to a previously untracked nation-state
level adversary.
AVIVORE has shown itself to be a highly capable threat actor, adept at both ‘living-off-theland’ and masquerading its activity within the ‘business as usual’ activities of employees in
its victim organisations. It has also shown a high degree of operational security awareness,
including routinely clearing forensic artefacts as it progresses, making detection and
investigation difficult.
“The capability of the threat actor makes detecting these incidents challenging, however the
complex nature of the supplier relationship makes investigation, co-operation and
remediation a significant issue,” said James Allman-Talbot, Head of Cyber Incident
Response at Context. “When the organisation that has enabled the intrusion forms a critical
part of your value chain, the operational business risk increases dramatically and difficult
decisions need to be made in a short space of time.”
To mitigate against these attacks, Context recommends the following measures:
Impose access limitations on supplier connections over VPNs, such as preventing
their use outside of the supplier’s business hours or from IP addresses and locations
other than those pre-agreed and restrict access only to data and assets they require
to perform their actions.
Ensure that security measures, such as multifactor authentication and enhanced
auditing/logging are deployed to hosts and services into which suppliers are required
to connect, in order to prevent or support the investigation of any suspicious user
behaviour.
Ensure that external remote access services implement appropriate log retention,
including sources of inbound connections and that identification of concurrent or
adjacent geographically-impossible connections is possible.
Ensure that credentials for highly privileged accounts and remote services are stored
securely and their use is appropriately monitored. Hosts such as domain controllers,
sensitive file shares and Public Key Infrastructure servers, should also be subject to
additional scrutiny and monitoring.
Where possible, applications, documentation and technical information related to
network infrastructure and configuration of remote access services should be made
available only to engineers, IT support staff and other individuals with legitimate
business needs.
