BlackTech is a cyber espionage group operating against targets in East Asia, particularly Taiwan, and
occasionally, Japan and Hong Kong. Based on the mutexes and domain names of some of their C&C servers,
BlackTech’s campaigns are likely designed to steal their target’s technology.
Following their activities and evolving tactics and techniques helped us uncover the proverbial red string of
fate that connected three seemingly disparate campaigns: PLEAD, Shrouded Crossbow, and of late,
Waterbear.
Over the course of their campaigns, we analyzed their modus operandi and dissected their tools of the trade—
and uncovered common denominators indicating that PLEAD, Shrouded Crossbow, and Waterbear may
actually be operated by the same group.
PLEAD
PLEAD is an information theft campaign with a penchant for conﬁdential documents. Active since 2012, it
has so far targeted Taiwanese government agencies and private organizations. PLEAD’s toolset includes the
self-named PLEAD backdoor and the DRIGO exﬁltration tool. PLEAD uses spear-phishing emails to deliver
and install their backdoor, either as an attachment or through links to cloud storage services. Some of the
cloud storage accounts used to deliver PLEAD are also used as drop off points for exﬁltrated documents
stolen by DRIGO.
PLEAD’s installers are disguised as documents using the right-to-left-override (RTLO) technique to
obfuscate the malware’s ﬁlename. They are mostly accompanied by decoy documents to further trick users.
We’ve also seen PLEAD use exploits for these vulnerabilities:
CVE-2015-5119, patched by Adobe last July, 2015
CVE-2012-0158, patched by Microsoft last April, 2012
CVE-2014-6352, patched by Microsoft last October, 2014
CVE-2017-0199, patched by Microsoft last April, 2017
PLEAD also dabbled with a short-lived, ﬁleless version of their malware when it obtained an exploit for a
Flash vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119) that was leaked during the Hacking Team breach.

Figure 1: How PLEAD utilizes compromised routers
PLEAD actors use a router scanner tool to scan for vulnerable routers, after which the attackers will enable
the router’s VPN feature then register a machine as virtual server. This virtual server will be used either as a
C&C server or an HTTP server that delivers PLEAD malware to their targets.
PLEAD also uses CVE-2017-7269, a buffer overﬂow vulnerability Microsoft Internet Information Services
(IIS) 6.0 to compromise the victim’s server. This is another way for them to establish a new C&C or HTTP
server.

Figure 2: One of the methods PLEAD operators use to distribute their malware
PLEAD’s backdoor can:
Harvest saved credentials from browsers and email clients like Outlook
List drives, processes, open windows, and ﬁles
Open remote Shell
Upload target ﬁle
Execute applications via ShellExecute API
Delete target ﬁle

PLEAD also uses the document-targeting exﬁltration tool DRIGO, which mainly searches the infected
machine for documents. Each copy of DRIGO contains a refresh token tied to speciﬁc Gmail accounts used
by the attackers, which are in turn linked to a Google Drive account. The stolen ﬁles are uploaded to these
Google Drives, where the attackers can harvest them.
Shrouded Crossbow
This campaign, ﬁrst observed in 2010, is believed to be operated by a well-funded group given how it
appeared to have purchased the source code of the BIFROST backdoor, which the operators enhanced and
created other tools from. Shrouded Crossbow targeted privatized agencies and government contractors as
well as enterprises in the consumer electronics, computer, healthcare, and ﬁnancial industries.
Shrouded Crossbow employs three BIFROST-derived backdoors: BIFROSE, KIVARS, and XBOW. Like
PLEAD, Shrouded Crossbow uses spear-phishing emails with backdoor-laden attachments that utilize the
RTLO technique and accompanied by decoy documents.
BIFROSE, known for evading detection by communicating with its C&C servers via Tor protocol, also has a
version targeting UNIX-based operating systems, which are usually used in servers, workstations, and mobile
devices. KIVARS has less functionality than BIFROSE, but its modular structure made it easier to maintain.
KIVARS enabled attackers to download and execute ﬁles, list drives, uninstall malware service, take
screenshots, activate/deactivate keylogger, show/hide active windows, and trigger mouse clicks and keyboard
inputs. A 64-bit version of KIVARS also emerged to keep pace with the popularity of 64-bit systems.
XBOW’s capabilities are derived from BIFROSE and KIVARS; Shrouded Crossbow gets its name from its
unique mutex format.
Waterbear
Waterbear has actually been operating for a long time. The campaign’s name is based on its malware’s
capability to equip additional functions remotely.
Waterbear similarly employs a modular approach to its malware. A loader component executable will
connect to the C&C server to download the main backdoor and load it in memory. A later version of this
malware appeared and used patched server applications as its loader component, while the main backdoor is
either loaded from an encrypted ﬁle or downloaded from the C&C server.
The tactic it later adopted required prior knowledge of their targets’ environment. It’s possible attackers used
Waterbear as a secondary payload to help maintain presence after gaining some levels of access into the
targets’ systems.
All Roads Lead to BlackTech
Based on the use of the same C&C servers, the campaigns’ coordinated efforts, and similarities in tools,
techniques, and objectives, we can conclude that they are operated by the same group. It is not uncommon,
for instance, for a group—especially a well-funded one—to split into teams and run multiple campaigns.
While most of the campaigns’ attacks are conducted separately, we’ve seen apparently joint operations
conducted in phases that entail the work of different teams at each point in the infection chain.
Use of the Same C&C Servers. In several instances, we found the campaigns’ malware communicating with
the same C&C servers. In targeted attacks, C&C servers are typically not shared with other groups. Here are
some of the C&C servers we found that are shared by the campaigns:

Additionally, the IP 211[.]72 [.]242[.]120 is one of the hosts for the domain microsoftmse[.]com, which has
been used by several KIVARS variants.

Joint Operations. We also found incidents where the backdoors were used on the same targets. While it’s
possible for separate groups to attack at the same time, we can construe at they are at least working together:
PLEAD

Table 3: Incidents where PLEAD, KIVARS, and Waterbear were used on the same target
Similarities between tools and techniques. PLEAD and KIVARS, for instance, share the use of RTLO
techniques to disguise their installers as documents. Both also use decoy documents to make the RTLO attack
more convincing. Another similarity is the use of a small loader component to load encrypted backdoors into
memory.
Similar Objectives. The ulterior motive of these campaigns is to steal important documents from their
victims; initial recipients of their attacks are not always their primary target. For instance, we saw several
decoy documents stolen by the attackers that are then used against another target. This indicates that
document theft is most likely the ﬁrst phase of an attack chain against a victim with ties to the intended
target. While PLEAD and KIVARS are most likely to be used in ﬁrst phase attacks, Waterbear can be seen as
a secondary backdoor installed after attackers have gained a certain level of privilege.
Based on the type of documents stolen by these campaigns, we can get a clearer view of who they’re
targeting and compromising, the purpose of their campaigns, and when they take place. Below are some of
the categories or labels of the stolen documents:
Address book
Budget
Business
Contract
Culture
Defense
Education
Energy
Foreign affairs
Funding application
Human affairs

Internal affairs
Laws
Livelihood economy
Meeting

Password list

Schedule

Enterprises Need to be Proactive
PLEAD, Shrouded Crossbow, and Waterbear are still actively mounting their campaigns against its targets,
which is why organizations must proactively secure their perimeter.
IT/system administrators and information security professionals can consider making a checklist of what to
look out for in the network for any signs of anomalies and suspicious behavior that can indicate intrusions.
Adopting best practices and employing multilayered security mechanisms and strategies against targeted

attacks are also recommended. Network trafﬁc analysis, deployment of ﬁrewalls and intrusion detection and
prevention systems, network segmentation, and data categorization are just some of them.
