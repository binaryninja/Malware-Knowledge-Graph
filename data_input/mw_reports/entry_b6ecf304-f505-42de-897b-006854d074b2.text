The Anomali Threat Research Team detected a spear phishing email targeting government employees
in the Municipality of Da Nang, Vietnam. The email contained a malicious Microsoft Excel document
which drops a malicious Dynamic-Link Library (DLL) providing the actor with CMD reverse shell over
HTTP. The DLL shares code similarities to exile-RAT, a tool associated with Pirate Panda. Pirate Panda
is an APT backed by China and known for targeting government and political organisations.
Pirate Panda has reportedly focused primarily on issues surrounding territorial conflicts in the South
China Sea [1]. As Da Nang lies on the Coast of Vietnam, opposite the Paracel Islands (an area of
territorial dispute), this may provide some understanding of why Pirate Panda would consider targeting
this municipality. [2]
The phishing email and lure document observed suggest that the employees targeted likely work within
a government-run data center. Such attacks are consistent with other regional APT campaigns [3]. If
Pirate Panda were to compromise a government-run data center, it would have access to vast amounts
of sensitive information.

Targeted Phishing
In the screenshot below, the phishing email shown was sent by a government employee to another
government employee. The intended victim had a “danang.gov.vn” appended to the email address, as
seen in the email headers.

Figure 1, Phishing email
The subject header is “Cập nhật lịch trực lễ 30/4 và ⅕,” which Google translates as “Updated live
schedule 30_4 and 1_5.eml.” The live schedule appeared to be for the dates of April 30 and May 1,
which may indicate that the lure theme was related to events on those days. As both 30 April and 1 May
are Vietnamese national holidays, it is plausible the theme related to those events, although we cannot
confirm that hypothesis based on available data.
30 April is “Reunification Day,” marking the unification between North and South Vietnam in 1975
May is Vietnam’s national “Labour Day” holiday, which has political associations with communism
and the working class

Figure 2, Email header for phishing sample
We assess that the phishing email likely came from a genuine internal mailbox, as Microsoft Exchange
categorised it as “Internal” and the IP address in the email header 10.196.132.154 was from an internal
private network. If the originating email account was associated with a real employee, that employee
was likely compromised previously, or they are conducting internal pentesting.
An open-source search of both email addresses only located information about the victim email address
in an online spreadsheet titled “Công viên phần mềm Đà Nẵng,” which Google translates to “Da Nang
Software Park.” We were unable to determine what if any link exists between the government employees
listed and the park. The spreadsheet contained email addresses, telephone numbers and possible job
titles for Da Nang government employees, with the victim’s job title translating to “Expert”. The

4/10

spreadsheet was hosted on dsp.vn, a government-owned site that described the Da Nang IT
Infrastructure Development Center as having been established under the People's Committee of Da
Nang City, a non-business unit under the Department of Information and Danang media. [4]

Figure 3, location of Da Nang
Da Nang lies on the coast across from the Paracel Islands, an area of territorial dispute [5]. in March
2020, the USS Theodore Roosevelt visited the port of Da Nang to commemorate the relationship
between Vietnam and the United States [6]. According to press reporting, ”Washington has placed a high
priority on improving its defense ties with Vietnam recently as part of President Donald Trump’s National
Defense Strategy, which prioritizes strategic competition with China and countering its growing military
capabilities in Asia.” [7]
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in naval activity in the South China Sea,
including the Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning and US Navy ships patrolling the area; indications of
ongoing regional tensions.

Malicious Excel Document
The phishing email contains an attachment called “lich truc li,” which translates as “office schedule.”

5/10

Figure 4, Screenshot of the malicious excel document
The spreadsheet contained a table with three titles “bảng phân công trực trung tâm dữ liệu,” which
translates as “Data Center assignment table,” “TRUNG TÂM PHÁT TRIỂN HẠ TẦNG ĐA NĂNG,” which
translates as “Multi-infrastructure development center,” and “phòng hệ thống,” which translates as
“system room.” This may support a hypothesis that the government employees work in a data center in
the Da Nang Software Park. This spreadsheet is likely an employee schedule. Column B appears to hold
employee names, whilst C & D correspond with shift patterns laid out in rows 19-24. An open-source
search suggests that the acronyms "“TC1,” “TC2,” and “TC3” may refer to technology centers.
When the Excel document is opened, two executables (utilman.exe and mpsvc.dll) will be dropped at
folder %AppData%MicrosoftCorporation. Utilman.exe is Windows Defender executable MsMpeng.exe.
The attacker is employing a DLL Side-Loading technique using a legitimate security product to load a
malicious dll [8]. This is a common technique for a variety of threat actors and groups. A shortcut for
utilman.exe is then created at the startup folder so that the dropped files execute during the next reboot
of the machine and communicate with a command and control (C2).

Figure 5, process graph
Mpsvc.dll initially makes a number of DNS requests to “dns.google” (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) which is
Google’s public DNS service. The domain name resolved as skypechatvideo[.]online.

Figure 6, pcap file for mpsvc.dll
After communicating to Google DNS, the victim machine communicates with the C2
skypechatvideo[.]online and sends the following GET request:
http://skypechatvideo[.]online/wwwlib/title.php?
ID=NzhERjJFQjgtNDk5RC03ODQ0LTlCNzctM0U2QUVBREYyNEU4:U1Q=
The C2 was hosted on an Apache server running PHP, and communicated with the victim machine over
port 49927. The domain skypechatvideo[.]online, which was registered at IP address 185.244.150[.]4 on
April 20, 2020 with Registrar NameSilo, was using a privacy service that obfuscated the registrant
information. Additionally, according to RiskIQ, only one other domain hosted on the IP address
185.244.150[.]4: onlinedocumentviewer[.]us which was first seen in July 2018. The small number of
domains suggests the infrastructure is owned rather than shared, and the long period between the
domains makes the relationship between them questionable.
The dropped executable mpsvc.dll, although containing a large quantity of unique code, was genetically
similar to exile-RAT and keyboy; both are RATs Pirate Panda deploys. It is likely that the threat actors
modified and developed the code since it was last used. The dll has a compilation date of 22 April 2020,

7/10

which is two days after the c2 domain was registered, and the phishing email was sent on 27 April 2020.
exile-RAT has been observed using the same DLL Sideloading technique, using a legitimate security
product to load a malicious dll. In this instance, Windows Defender is being used.

Conclusion
The phishing email and the lure document suggest that the attack was crafted to target government
employees working at a data centre, which is consistent with previous data center targeting by other
campaigns attributed to APTs [9]. If the phishing email was sent by a real employee, it is possible that
members of the Da Nang government have already been compromised, but were not the targets of
interest or didn't have the required access to desired information. It is possible that the national holidays
are being used as a lure, because the threat actors may have an imminent desire for lateral movement
and access to data. While Anomali has not been able to figure out what information the threat actors are
attempting to obtain, if an attacker were to compromise a government-run data center, it would have
access to vast amounts of sensitive information. Read more about People’s Republic of China (PRC) in
