OVERVIEW
The Hidden Lynx group is a professional team of attackers with advanced capabilities. They
were responsible for the compromise of security firm Bit9’s digital code-signing certificate
which was used to sign malware. The Bit9 breach was part of the much larger VOHO
campaign and that campaign was just one of many operations undertaken by the group over
the last four years.
The group likely offers a “hackers for hire” operation and is tasked with retrieving specific
information from a wide range of corporate and government targets. They are a highly
efficient team who can undertake multiple campaigns at once, breach some of the world’s
best-protected organizations and can change their tactics quickly to achieve their goal.
They usually attack using multiple customized Trojans designed for specific purposes.
Backdoor.Moudoor is used for larger campaigns and has seen widespread distribution while
Trojan.Naid is reserved for special operations against high value targets. The group uses
cutting-edge attack techniques which makes this team stand out from other major attack
groups.
This paper takes an in-depth look at the Hidden Lynx group, their targets and their
motivations. It will look into their capabilities and attack strategies through their attack
campaigns including the Bit9 incident.

BACKGROUND

A well-known
group with
affiliations to
“Operation
Aurora” managed
to break into Bit9’s
network using
an SQL injection
attack.

Hidden Lynx – Professional Hackers for Hire

Background
In February 2013, Bit9 released a statement revealing that in July 2012, their network had been compromised by
a malicious third-party. A well-known group named Hidden Lynx with affiliations to “Operation Aurora” managed
to break into Bit9’s network using an SQL injection attack. These Trojans made their way into the defense
industrial sector.
However, the Bit9 compromise was only a small piece of a much larger watering-hole operation known as the
VOHO campaign, which impacted hundreds of organizations in the United States. Further, the VOHO campaign
itself was just one campaign of many that is attributable to this incredibly prolific group. Each campaign is
designed to access information in governmental and commercial organizations that tend to operate in the
wealthiest and most technologically advanced countries in the world.

Who are the Hidden Lynx group?
The Hidden Lynx group has been in operation since at least 2009 and is most likely a professional organization
that offers a “hackers for hire” service. They have the capability to attack many organizations with concurrently
running campaigns. They operate efficiently and move quickly and methodically. Based on these factors, the
Hidden Lynx group would need to be a sizeable organization made up of between 50 and 100 individuals.
The members of this group are experts at breaching systems. They engage in a two-pronged strategy of mass
exploitation and pay-to-order targeted attacks for intellectual property using two Trojans designed specifically
for each purpose:
• Team Moudoor distributes Backdoor.Moudoor, a customized version of “Gh0st RAT”, for large-scale campaigns
across several industries. The distribution of Moudoor requires a sizeable number of people to both breach
targets and retrieve the information from the compromised networks.
• Team Naid distributes Trojan.Naid, the Trojan found during the Bit9 incident, which appears to be reserved
for more limited attacks against high value targets. This Trojan was leveraged for a special operation during
the VOHO campaign and is probably used by a specific team of highly skilled attackers within the group. This
Trojan was also found as part of “Operation Aurora” in 2009.
Much of the attack infrastructure and tools used during these campaigns originate from network infrastructure
in China. The Hidden Lynx group makes regular use of zero-day exploits and has the ability to rework and
customize exploits quickly. They are methodical in their approach and they display a skillset far in advance of
some other attack groups also operating in that region, such as the Comment Crew (also known as APT1). The
Hidden Lynx group is an advanced persistent threat that has been in operation for at least four years and is
breaking into some of the best-protected organizations in the world. With a zero-day attack already under their
belt in 2013, they continue to operate at the leading edge of targeted attacks.

WHO ARE THEIR TARGETS?

The diverse set
of targets from a
variety of sectors
would indicate
that this group is
not focused on any
one specific task.

Hidden Lynx – Professional Hackers for Hire

Who are their targets?
Since November 2011, hundreds
of organizations worldwide have
been targeted by the Hidden Lynx
group. These organizations have
remained relatively consistent during
this time period. The group targets
organizations operating in both the
commercial sector and within all
levels of government. The diverse set
of targets from a variety of sectors
would indicate that this group is not
focused on any one specific task. The
group manages concurrent campaigns
in attacks that are global in nature.
The Hidden Lynx group has most
recently conducted attacks against
specific organizations in South Korea
and has a long history of attacking the
defense industrial sector of Western
countries.
The top 10 organizations categorized
by the verticals they belong to are
shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Top 10 organizations targeted by the Hidden Lynx group since
November 2011

The most targeted countries/regions
are shown in Figure 2.

What is their motivation?
This broad range of targeted
information would indicate that the
attackers are part of a professional
organization. They are likely
tasked with obtaining very specific
information that could be used to
gain competitive advantages at both
a corporate and nation state level.
It is unlikely that this organization
engages in processing or using the
stolen information for direct financial
gain. Their mode of operation would
suggest that they may be a private
organization of “hackers for hire”,
who are highly skilled, experienced
professionals whose services are
available for those willing to pay.

Corporate Espionage
The financial services sector has been identified as the most heavily targeted industry overall. There is a
tendency to target specific companies within this sector. Investment banks and asset management agencies
account for the majority of organizations targeted within this industry. The absence of certain types of financial
institutions, such as those operating as commercial banks, clearly indicates that the attacks are focusing on
specific areas. The organizations involved would have expertise in large corporate deals, such as confidential
information on upcoming mergers and acquisitions, which could be used to gain a competitive edge. Targeting
this sector in such a concentrated fashion could provide invaluable information when negotiating large takeovers
or trading shares on the stock exchange.
Attacks on the financial sector are not limited to investment banks. Stock trading firms and one of the world’s
largest stock exchanges have been subjected to attacks from this group. The Hidden Lynx group has also
undertaken indirect attacks through the supply chains. Organizations that supply hardware, secure network
communications and services specific to the financial sector have also come under attack. There is almost
certainly a financial motivation behind these attacks.

Attacks against government contractors
In attacks that have targeted all levels of government from local to national level, this group has repeatedly
attempted to infiltrate these networks. Attacks against government contractors and, more specifically, the
defense industry indicate that the group is in pursuit of confidential information and suggests that the group
had been working for nation states.
Targeting advanced technologies in specific areas such as aerospace would be useful in order to close
technological gaps or gain knowledge of the advanced capabilities of other nation states. Attacks on
organizations that operate in the Internet services space can provide a wealth of valuable information. The group
had affiliations to “Operation Aurora” (See appendix for more details), a campaign that targeted a number of
organizations including software manufacturers and defense contractors. More recently, Microsoft claimed that
the target was databases containing emails marked for court order wiretaps. They believe that these attacks
were counter-intelligence operations, activities that would provide benefits at a nation state level.

What are they capable of?
The group’s tools, tactics and procedures are innovative and typically cutting-edge. They use custom tools and
techniques that they tailor to meet their objectives and maximize their chance of success. They attack publicfacing infrastructure and have been observed installing highly customized Trojans that are purpose-built for
stealth. They engineered one of the most successful watering-hole attacks to-date. They also undertake spearphishing attacks and hack supply chains in order to distribute their custom Trojans. This is an established team
with years of experience. They are well resourced and highly skilled.
The Hidden Lynx group’s advanced capabilities are clearly demonstrated in three major campaigns. In the VOHO
campaign, they showed how they could subvert Bit9’s established trust models. In the FINSHO campaign, they
managed to get advanced knowledge of a zero-day exploit and in the SCADEF operation, they undertook supply
chain attacks to succeed in their campaign.

Subverting trust protection models
The team can adapt rapidly to counter-measures that would otherwise hinder the success of a campaign. The
attack on Bit9 showed how the group could bypass solid trust protection models to get to their targets. However,
this attack was only a small part of the larger VOHO campaign, where the group proved how quickly they can
adapt and change their tactics in the face of new and unforeseen obstacles.

The Bit9 incident
Bit9 is a security company headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts. As an alternative to traditional
signature-based antivirus solutions, Bit9 offers a trust-based security platform that runs off of a cloud-based
reputation service combined with policy-driven
application control and whitelisting to protect against
cyberthreats. As a result, it is difficult for a malicious
third-party to install an untrusted application, such
as a remote access Trojan (RAT), onto a system
that is adequately protected with the Bit9 platform.
Undaunted by this, the elite Hidden Lynx group took
up the challenge.
On February 8 2013, Bit9 released details revealing
that a malicious third-party had gained access to one
of their digital code-signing certificates. During this
incident, a number of Trojans and malicious scripts
were signed. In a follow up post on February 25, more
details of the attack emerged. In July 2012, more than
six months earlier, a malicious third-party gained
access to their network using an SQL injection attack.
Due to an operational oversight, a public-facing
server that wasn’t protected with the Bit9 platform
allowed the attackers to gain unauthorized access.

Figure 3. Trojan.Naid – Bit9 digital certific ate, July 13,
2012, provided by Symantec’s CA

The attackers installed Backdoor.Hikit, a Trojan
that provides extremely stealthy remote access to
compromised systems. This highly customized Trojan
is typically installed onto servers in the victims’ DMZ,
which was the case at Bit9. Credentials for another
virtual machine were then stolen. These were used
to access the virtual machine that contained one of
Bit9’s digital code-signing certificates. The attackers
used this code-signing infrastructure to sign
thirty-two malicious files. Symantec telemetry
shows some of these files have been present
within select organizations in the United States
defense industrial sector.
The signing of these files is significant, since
they could then be used to circumvent the
trust protection model offered by the Bit9
platform. The Trojans signed include variants
of Backdoor.Hikit (the remote access Trojan
used in the initial compromise) and another
RAT called Trojan.Naid. Some malicious attack
scripts were also signed. Each Trojan has a
specific purpose. Backdoor.Hikit was used to
target public-facing infrastructure while Trojan.
Naid was used to perform highly targeted
attacks through email and watering-holes.

Figure 4. Trojans successfully acquired with command-andcontrol (C&C) servers from the Bit9 investigation

Bit9 was alerted to the compromise in January
2013 and took immediate containment steps
such as revoking the digital signature and
reaching out to their entire customer base.
According to Bit9, the attacks that followed

Hidden Lynx – Professional Hackers for Hire

were not financially motivated, but rather were an attempt to access information. On Bit9’s own admission,
three customers were impacted.
In conjunction with the Bit9 compromise, the Hidden Lynx group had another significant campaign well under
way. They had just concluded phase one of the VOHO campaign, a watering-hole operation orchestrated to
attack organizations in the Boston, Massachusetts area – it was a likely a distribution vector for the newly signed
files.

The VOHO campaign
The VOHO campaign, first publicized by RSA, is one of the
largest and most successful watering-hole attacks to date.
The campaign combined both regional and industry-specific
attacks and predominantly targeted organizations that
operate in the United States. In a rapidly spreading twophase attack, which started on June 25 and finished July 18,
nearly 4,000 machines had downloaded a malicious payload.
These payloads were being delivered to unsuspecting
victims from legitimate websites that were strategically
compromised.
This watering-hole infection technique was quite innovative
at the time. In a watering-hole attack, the attacker
compromises a legitimate website that the target uses and
trusts. The attacker then lies in wait for the target to visit
the compromised site in order to infect them. The scale and
targeted nature of the VOHO campaign set it apart from
watering-hole attacks observed in the past. The group first
adopted this technique in December 2011 when an exploit
for the Oracle Java SE Rhino Script Engine Remote Code
Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2011-3544) was leveraged to
distribute their payloads. As a result of their success, many
other strategic compromises have
been adopted by other attack groups,
as seen in a notable attack targeting
iOS developers earlier in 2013 which
impacted employees at Facebook,
Apple and Twitter.

Figure 5. The VOHO campaign target regions and
industries

In the VOHO campaign, ten legitimate
websites were strategically
compromised. The attackers carefully
selected these websites based on
the likelihood that the intended
target(s) would visit them during the
exploit delivery phase. The attackers
likely pre-determined who visited
the watering-hole in advance of the
distribution phase of attack. This
could easily be achieved by examining
the access logs of compromised Web
servers. The categories of websites
compromised were both regional
and industry-specific in nature and
Figure 6. The VOHO campaign malicious activity timeline targeted the following key areas
a two-phase attack
illustrated in Figure 5.

Page 10

Timeline of activity
The VOHO watering-hole distributed remote access Trojans in two phases. In phase one of the attack, an Internet
Explorer zero-day vulnerability, the Microsoft XML Core Services CVE-2012-1889 Remote Code Execution
Vulnerability (CVE-2012-1889), was leveraged. On July 10, Microsoft introduced the patch for CVE-2012-1889
and activity at the watering-hole ceased. This appears to have been a clever decision on behalf of the attackers.
If they continued to deliver the exploit, they risked detection and would have hurt their chances of retaining
access to the watering-hole for phase two of the campaign. Within six days, phase two of the distribution began,
this time using a malicious Java applet exploiting the Oracle Java SE CVE-2012-1723 Remote Code Execution
Vulnerability (CVE-2012-1723). This Java exploit was patched at the time. Having already used two zero-day
exploits in quick succession (the first zero-day exploit was used in the GOTHAM campaign in May 2012, see
appendix for more details), the Hidden Lynx group may not have had another one at their disposal.
The timeline of activity at the watering-hole is shown in Figure 6.
In each phase of the attack, two Trojans were being distributed at different intervals. The customized version
of “Gh0st RAT”, Backdoor.Moudoor, saw large-scale distribution in comparison to Trojan.Naid, which was used
more selectively in these attacks.
Before being used in the second phase of the attack, Trojan.Naid was signed with the Bit9 certificate. Moudoor
was never observed during the attack on Bit9, which could indicate that two separate teams are at work
here. With Moudoor and Naid using different command-and-control (C&C) servers, each team could work
independently on alternative objectives. The discovery of the Naid C&C would also be less likely in comparison
to Moudoor’s, as its large-scale distribution would inevitably create more noise as it continued to impact many
organizations.

Figure 7. The VOHO campaign – Trojans distributed and C&C servers used to command and control

Page 11

Team Naid’s role
During this campaign, Team Naid had a very specific objective – to gain access to information from organizations
operating in the defense industrial sector. An unsigned version of Naid was distributed to select victims within
the defense industrial sector during phase one until Microsoft supplied a patch for CVE-2012-1889 on July 10. It
may have been during this phase of the attack when the team realized the information they sought was held by
organizations protected by Bit9. As the team found it difficult to compromise Bit9-protected computers and had
no viable exploit for distribution, their immediate objective focused on Bit9’s digital code-signing certificate.
By July 13, just a few days after they started their attacks on Bit9, they obtained the Bit9-signed Naid. By the
next day, they had built a viable Java exploit to distribute their Trojan. Armed with the newly-signed Trojan and
delivery vehicle, the group resumed malicious activity at the watering-hole for three days from July 16. It was
during this period that three organizations protected with the Bit9 platform were successfully compromised.
In this campaign, Naid was specifically reserved for special operations against high value targets. Team Naid’s
objective was narrow and focused and the team aimed to limit Naid’s exposure. The sophistication of the
overall attack is typical of attackers with a very high pedigree. The team is clearly highly skilled; they operate
methodically and can switch objectives at a moment’s notice. They rapidly adapted to external factors that were
hindering their specific objective and pursued a difficult prize - the Bit9 certificate - in order to achieve their
overall goal.

Team Moudoor’s role
The distribution of Moudoor
during this campaign was on a
much larger scale. Organizations
operating in the financial sector,
all levels of government (local and
federal), healthcare, education
and law were impacted during
this campaign. There is a wealth
of sensitive information within
these organizations which would
be of interest to both nation states
and entities that would benefit
from information as a result of
corporate espionage attacks.
The top distinct infections per
organization type are shown in
Figure 8.
A campaign distributing Moudoor
on such a large scale would
require a sizeable team to
operate and maintain remote
access to these compromised
computers. The breach phase
of the operation could easily
be handled by a smaller team,
which then passes control to a
larger team of operators who can
traverse networks and retrieve the
information they are tasked with
gaining access to. To efficiently

Figure 8. Industries with the most Backdoor.Moudoor infections during the
VOHO campaign

Page 12

Hidden Lynx – Professional Hackers for Hire

attack this many organizations concurrently would require an equally large number of operators. These Trojans
require manual operation so it’s conceivable that tens if not hundreds of operators would be used post-breach to
process and handle the stolen data.
The VOHO campaign is one of a number of campaigns attributed to this group over the last four years. It showed
how quickly the group could change their strategy and the lengths they would go to get to their targets. The fact
that the Bit9 code-signing certificate breach was only a small part of this campaign shows how adaptable and
determined the group is.

Advanced zero-day access
The group is highly organized and can gain advanced access to zero-day vulnerabilities. In February, the Hidden
Lynx group used this advanced knowledge to take advantage of the Oracle Java SE CVE-2013-1493 Remote
Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2013-1493) to attack Japanese targets in the FINSHO campaign.

FINSHO
Within two days of Bit9’s
blog post on February
25, the attackers began
distributing Moudoor
and Naid in a campaign
that leveraged CVE-20131493. Interestingly, the
C&C server configured in
Naid (110.173.55.187)
was also configured in
a sample found in the
Bit9 incident. Although
the version used against
Bit9 was not observed
elsewhere in the wild,
the group’s methodical
approach would indicate
that a similar campaign
may have been intended
for that Trojan.
The timeline for exploit
development and
distribution is illustrated
in Figure 9.

Figure 9. Timeline of activity for CVE-2013-1493 distributing Moudoor and Naid
in the FINSHO campaign

According to Oracle’s blog,
CVE-2013-1493 was reported to
them on February 1, the same day
that class files exploiting it were
added to MightDev.jar shown in
Figure 10. In past Java exploits
used by this group, the code was
already public knowledge and a
patch was already available for the Figure 10. MightDev.jar used to distribute Naid and subsequently Moudoor
software. In this case, they gained
advanced knowledge from an unknown source - a source with early access to the exploit conditions, possibly on
the same day as Oracle. Oracle released the fix for CVE-2013-1493 on March 4.

Page 13

Hidden Lynx – Professional Hackers for Hire

Figure 11 illustrates the
relationship between FINSHO
and the Bit9 incident through the
shared C&C server used in both
Naid configurations.
Alternate C&C servers and separate
websites for distribution provide
further evidence that there are
distinctions between how these
teams operate.

Supply chain attacks
The Hidden Lynx group continued
to attack the defense industry
post-VOHO. In another campaign
named SCADEF, manufacturers
and suppliers of military-grade
computers were observed installing
a Trojanized Intel driver application.

SCADEF

Figure 11. CVE-2013-1493 used to distribute Trojan.Naid and
Backdoor.Moudoor (February/March 2013) in the FINSHO campaign

The attackers bundled this Intel driver application with variants of Backdoor.Moudoor using a popular Chinese
archiving application called Haozip. The attackers likely compromised a legitimate download of this driver
application from a non-reputable source but the true source was never discovered in this investigation.

Figure 12. Supply chain hacking detections in the IT supply/defense/healthcare industry

The technique is another
avenue into hardened
networks of interest.
They attack not only
hardware suppliers, but
contractors that may
access these networks
during their course of
work. The group seeks
out the weakest link in
the chain and simply lies
in wait. In these specific
attacks, they simply
wait for a shipment of
compromised computers
to be installed into the
targeted network. Unique
detections observed
for these Trojanized
applications are
presented in Figure 12.

The VOHO, FINSHO and SCADEF campaigns each showed how efficient and adaptable the group is when focusing on
their targets. They use a wide range of advanced attack methods and change their strategy when required to carry
out each operation. These three campaigns are only some of the operations undertaken by the Hidden Lynx group,
making them a credible threat to several industries.

CONCLUSION

From the evidence
seen, it’s clear
that Hidden
Lynx belongs to
a professional
organization.

Hidden Lynx – Professional Hackers for Hire

Conclusion
Cyberespionage campaigns are becoming increasingly common, with countless threat actors attempting to gain
footholds into some of the best-protected organizations. These attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated.
The capabilities and tactics used by these threat actors vary considerably. The Hidden Lynx group is capable
of undertaking focused attacks against niche targets and running large-scale campaigns targeting multiple
organizations on a global scale. They have seen action in numerous campaigns since 2009 and repeatedly attack
their targets with cutting-edge techniques. They quickly adapt to security counter-measures and are highly
motivated. They are one of the most well-resourced and capable attack groups in the targeted threat landscape.
From the evidence seen, it’s clear that Hidden Lynx belongs to a professional organization. They operate in a highly
efficient manner. They can attack on multiple fronts. They use the latest techniques, have access to a diverse set
of exploits and have highly customized tools to compromise target networks. Their attacks, carried out with such
precision on a regular basis over long periods of time, would require a well-resourced and sizeable organization.
They possess expertise in many areas, with teams of highly skilled individuals who can adapt rapidly to the changing
landscape. This team could easily consist of 50-100 individuals. This level of resources would be needed to build
these Trojans, maintain infection and C&C infrastructure and pursue confidential information on multiple networks.
They are highly skilled and experienced campaigners in pursuit of information of value to both commercial and
governmental organizations.
The incident in Bit9, which ultimately led to successful compromises of hard-to-crack targets during the VOHO
campaign, only serves to highlight this fact. The evolving targeted attack landscape is becoming increasingly
sophisticated. As organizations implement security counter-measures, the attackers are adapting at a rapid rate.
With a growing number of threat actors participating in these campaigns, organizations have to understand that
sophisticated attackers are working hard to bypass each layer of security. It’s no longer safe to assume that any one
solution will protect a company’s assets. A variety of solutions need to be combined and, with a better understanding
of the adversary, tailored to adequately protect the information of most interest to the attackers.
The Hidden Lynx group’s mission is large and they’re targeting a diverse set of information. The frequency and
diversity of these attacks would indicate that the attackers are tasked with sourcing information from many
organizations. These tasks are likely distributed within the team. The group’s goal is to gain access to information
within organizations in some of the wealthiest and most technologically advanced countries across the globe. It is
unlikely that they can use this information for direct financial gain, and the diversity of the information and number
of distinguishable campaigns would suggest that they are contracted by multiple clients. This leads us to believe that
this is a professional organization that offers a “hackers for hire” service.
The worrying knock-on effect of this group’s activities is that other threat actors are learning and adopting their
techniques. The Hidden Lynx group is not basking in their past glories, they are continuing to refine and streamline
their operations and techniques to stay one step ahead of their competition. Organizations that are being attacked
on multiple fronts need to better protect the information that is most valuable to them. We expect these attackers
to be involved in many more high profile campaigns in the coming years. They will continue to adapt and innovate.
They will continue to provide information servicing interests at both a corporate and state level. Groups like Hidden
Lynx are certainly winning some of the battles, but as organizations gain a better understanding of how these groups
operate, they can take steps to help prevent their most valuable information from falling into attackers’ hands.

Since 2011, the Hidden Lynx
group has leveraged five
browser-based exploits for payload distribution, three of which were zero-day exploits.
The list of browser-based
exploits used by the Hidden
Lynx group since the
introduction of Moudoor is
presented in Table 1.
In the first half of 2012,
there was a particularly high
distribution of Moudoor. There
was a peak in June/July as a
result of the VOHO campaign
which is evident in the graph
shown in Figure 13.
There is also a peak at the
beginning of the year which
is a result of another high
distribution campaign called
WSDHEALTHY. This campaign,
along with some other notable
attacks and techniques, will
be discussed in the following
sections.

GOTHAM – Campaigns running concurrently
On May 30th, The Hidden Lynx group used their first zero-day exploit of 2012, taking advantage of the Microsoft
Internet Explorer CVE-2012-1875 Same ID Property Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2012-1875) in order
to distribute Moudoor and Naid from gothamcenter.org, a website devoted to the history of New York. This was a
two-phase attack which saw Team Naid and Team Moudoor share C&C infrastructure (219.90.117.132) in a smaller
campaign that infected organizations in the following industries:
• Financial services
• Information communications technology
• Government
• Marketing
• Information technology
• Aerospace/defense
• Energy
Many of the industries
targeted in this
campaign are similar
to those targeted in
the VOHO campaign,
so this could be
considered as a
pre-cursor to that
campaign. Similar to
VOHO, this was a twophased attack that
leveraged two Internet
Explorer zero-days
for distribution (CVE2012-1875 and CVE2012-1889). Similar
to VOHO, as Microsoft
patched CVE-20121875, the attackers
Figure 14. Activity timeline on gothamcenter.org
halted distribution.
This prevented
any unnecessary
suspicious activity from being identified that could
impact future activity from the compromised website.
A timeline for this activity is presented in Figure 14.
Sharing C&C infrastructure could indicate that both
teams were working closely together and may have
divided up the effort during this campaign. During
phase two of this campaign, VOHO began. The Hidden
Lynx group is clearly resourced to operate and
maintain distribution and C&C infrastructure across
multiple campaigns. This level of organization requires
discipline at multiple levels within the group. This
is not a small group of elite hackers – this is a wellorganized professional organization.
One campaign that rivals VOHO in terms of size is
WSDHEALTHY. This is the first campaign where we see
the group using Naid and Moudoor together sharing
infrastructure and the first links to the Bit9 incident

Figure 15. Moudoor and Naid share distribution and
command and control servers

start to emerge.

WSDHEALTHY – Shared infrastructure with the Bit9 incident
The Hidden Lynx group began
using watering-hole attacks
as early as December 2011.
Although no zero-day exploit
was available, they used a
patched Java exploit (CVE2011-3544) effectively to
distribute Moudoor from three
compromised websites. This
campaign provided the first
indications that the group was
using both Moudoor and Naid
to attack targets and share
C&C infrastructure. Along with
this, early links to the attacks
on Bit9 began to emerge.
The timeline of this activity is
shown in Figure 16.
In these campaigns, the
Hidden Lynx group made
heavy use of infrastructure in
Hong Kong, with the exception Figure 16. Timeline of malicious activity associated with CVE-2011-3544
of yahooeast.net. This is
this domain that links to the
Bit9 attack, as it resolved
to 66.153.86.14 – a C&C
server used by the Backdoor.
Hikit sample installed after
the successful SQL injection
attack on Bit9. Moudoor was
being actively distributed from
these websites for two, four
and five months respectively.
These are exceptionally long
periods of time to retain access
to compromised servers for
payload distribution of this
nature.
The C&C servers used and the
links between the Trojans and
Bit9 are shown in Figure 17.
Team Moudoor heavily relies
on a dynamic DNS service
called DTDNS to rapidly
switch between C&C servers.
In fact, they use direct IP
connections or DTDNS
exclusively to establish C&C
communications, with the

Figure 17. CVE-2011-3544 - the first links between Moudoor and Naid emerge

Page 20

Hidden Lynx – Professional Hackers for Hire

exception of yahooeast.net
which is a registered domain.
The Hidden Lynx group uses
techniques which have clearly
been established through
experience to maintain this
infrastructure for long periods of
time. They adapt quickly and likely
have a stockpile of C&C servers
that they can quickly switch to
which provides maximum uptime
during any given operation.
Along with this, the Hidden Lynx
group uses several different
methods to infect their targets.
In the SCADEF campaign, we saw
how the group bundled Moudoor
with legitimate software to infect
targets. They also managed to
Trojanize software updates as
well, as seen in the EASYUPDATE
campaign where a Chinese
P2P application was observed
selectively installing Moudoor
since 2011.

EASYUPDATE – A
Trojanized software
update

Figure 18. Percentage breakdown of unique detections from VeryCD P2P client

Since November 2011, the Hidden
Lynx group has been able to insert
Moudoor into the distribution
chain of one of the most popular
Chinese P2P applications provided
by VeryCD.com. There is a very
low distribution of Trojanized
updates and it is quite likely that
they are somehow selectively
installing Moudoor on specific
clients. This is, without a doubt,
the longest running distribution
vector for the group, which
infected victims predominantly in
China, the United States and Hong
Kong.
These are the earliest indications
of Moudoor infections, with
“kissnada” being one of the first
DTDNS domains observed in use.
This distribution vector’s exact
purpose is still unclear, however
it’s certainly linked to the group,

as we have observed Moudoor
samples in WSDHEALTHY
configured to use kissnada58.
chatnook.com and usamail.scieron.com for C&C
communications.
The Hidden Lynx group
has left a clear fingerprint
for the past two years with
clearly identifiable links to
the group’s activities. The
use of customized Trojans,
shared distribution and
C&C infrastructure, coupled
with repeated attacks on
a predictable set of target
organizations has allowed
a more complete picture of
these attacks to be compiled. A
summary of the links between
all of these attacks is presented
in Figure 20.

Trojans used by the
Hidden Lynx group
The following section lists the
Trojans that were used by the
Hidden Lynx group throughout
their various campaigns.

Backdoor.Moudoor
In 2011, the Hidden Lynx
group began to use Backdoor.
Moudoor. This is a customized
version of “Gh0st RAT”.
Gh0st RAT variants have
been used in cyberespionage
campaigns emanating from
Figure 20. Linking the group’s activity (November 2011-March 2013)
China for years. In 2009,
Information Warfare Monitor
published a detailed report,
“Tracking GhostNet”, following an investigation
into a cyberespionage network of more than 1,000
compromised computers affecting more than 100
countries. Many threat actors use customized versions of
this RAT for cyberespionage operations.

Trojan.Naid
The team uses Trojan.Naid for special operations. It
first appeared in May 2009 and has been used in many
high profile attacks over the past four years. It shares

Page 22

Figure 21. Naid/Vasport obfuscation tool

Hidden Lynx – Professional Hackers for Hire

technical similarities with other Trojans which also originate from China. All of these Trojans are potentially from
the same group or they may source these Trojans from the same developer. The technical similarities are based on a
shared file creation template and C&C protocol.
The other Trojans that share these traits are:
• Backdoor.Vasport
• Backdoor.Boda

File creation template
%TEMP%\uid.ax
%%TEMP%%\%s.ax
%%TEMP%%\%s _ p.ax

Command and control template
POST http://%ls:%d/%x HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: 2
CONNECT %ls:%d HTTP/1.1
Connection: keep-alive
lynx

There is also evidence that
Backdoor.Vasport and Trojan.
Naid have shared the same
packer to obfuscate the
payloads from AV detection.
The obfuscation tool used is
also Chinese in origin and has
a simple user interface to help
pack these Trojans.

Naid also has a history of using
stolen digital certificates to
overcome trust-based protection
when attacking certain hardened
targets. Some of the certificates
identified are shown in Figure 22.

Backdoor.Vasport
Backdoor.Vasport was delivered
by exploiting the Adobe Flash
Player CVE-2012-0779 Object
Type Confusion Remote Code
Execution Vulnerability (CVE2012-0779). This was delivered
in malicious Word documents
in targeted attack emails. The
exploit component used in these
attacks was also used in the
Elderwood Platform.
Table 2 shows the payload from
the malicious word documents.

Backdoor.Boda
In a more recent campaign called Ladyboyle, Backdoor.Boda was being distributed to take advantage of the Adobe

Page 23

Hidden Lynx – Professional Hackers for Hire

Flash Player CVE-2013-0634 Remote Memory Corruption Vulnerability (CVE-2013-0634). These files were
signed with a digital signature from MGAME Corporation, a tactic used previously by the attackers. Interestingly,
Backdoor.Boda and
Backdoor.Vasport were both
distributed using Flash zeroday exploits in embedded
documents. It’s plausible
that the group has a team
dedicated to distribution
using Flash exploits that
customizes Trojans from the
same code base that the Naid
uses.

Trojan.Hydraq
(Operation Aurora)
The Hidden Lynx group has
used cutting-edge attack
techniques and a consistent
methodology. Trojan.Naid
has been in use since 2009
and Hidden Lynx attacks
bear the hallmarks of a
campaign that involved yet
another Internet Explorer
zero-day exploit in December
2009. Trojan.Naid was
used in the infamous
attacks on organizations in
the financial, technology,
Internet and media sectors
called “Operation Aurora”.
These attacks are linked
with another Trojan called
Trojan.Hydraq, but Naid was
downloaded in stage three of
the operation.
Trojan.Hydraq disappeared
from the targeted attack
landscape shortly after
Operation Aurora, most likely Figure 23. Trojan.Naid links to Hydraq and Operation Aurora
due to the close attention
that it was receiving from
security researchers. Trojan.Naid did not meet the same fate, as it is still being used in sophisticated targeted
attacks to this day.
