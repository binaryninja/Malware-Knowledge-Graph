Executive Summary
Turning cutting-edge research into operational capabilities is the
currency of cyber operations. The vulnerability no one else knows
about, one found by someone with highly specific knowledge of a
program or coding language, opens a backdoor into an adversary’s
most sensitive vault. A better understanding of one technology or
technique can give cyber operators an advantage over opponents.
Governments benefit from compressing the timelines from
discovery to exploitation, more rapidly using the insights of
researchers for operations.
Artificial intelligence (AI) and its current dominant paradigm,
machine learning (ML), almost certainly will not fundamentally alter
competition in cyberspace. That said, AI systems will provide both
new terrain for cyber operations—as targets that can themselves
be hacked—and new tools of cyber operations, as ML aids
offensive and defensive efforts. China’s military-civil fusion
strategy takes a holistic approach to development and aims to
seamlessly incorporate private resources and developments for
state use, with the goal of shortening the pathway for nongovernmental research on AI and cybersecurity to strengthen and
diversify government operational capabilities.1
There is notable precedent for using university developments in
state-sponsored hacking operations. Over the past decade, China’s
security services have repeatedly turned to select university faculty
to conduct research on cyber techniques and, in some cases, run
cyber operations. Collaboration between university faculty and
cyber operators illustrates China’s approach to military-civil fusion.
This report identifies six universities that previously worked with
China’s state-sponsored hacking teams and are now conducting
research on the use of ML for cyber capabilities; two universities
also host research programs on cyber attack and cyber defense of
AI systems. This report summarizes the extent to which these
universities, with ties to known state-sponsored hacking teams,
might aid China’s efforts in these areas.

Key Findings
● Multiple universities with connections to Advanced
Persistent Threat (APT) cyber actors are conducting
research on the intersection of cybersecurity and ML. All
six universities employ faculty who are actively conducting
research on ML and cybersecurity. At least one known statebacked hacker is researching how to use ML for anomaly
detection, a defensive cybersecurity technique. Shanghai
Jiao Tong University’s School of Information Security
Engineering, a school with ties to the PLA, hosts a research
institute conducting research on offensive and defensive
cybersecurity techniques; the director of that institute
published an analysis of ML and cybersecurity trends in a
Ministry of State Security periodical. Research on
cybersecurity and AI is moving from academic journals to
strategy forums for China’s security services.
● Research conducted on the application of machine
learning and AI to cybersecurity is extensive, particularly
in the areas of anomaly detection systems, malware
classification, behavior analysis, and active defense. Most
papers published by faculty from these universities
examined how to use machine learning for defensive
purposes. Offensively oriented papers noted ML’s
application to vulnerability discovery and exploitation—a
dual-use technique that can secure or wreck software. One
paper published by an author at Xidian University and
funded by the Key State Laboratory for Information
Security’s Unclassified Projects Fund concluded that ML
could bolster cyber defenses and improve vulnerability
discovery.
● Research on the attack and defense of AI systems was
less pervasive than research on applying the technology to
cybersecurity. Two schools favored for recruiting cyber
operators for specific hacking groups are researching the
vulnerability of AI systems. Zhejiang University offers
classes on the attack and defense of AI systems, alongside
classes on how to write intelligence reports.2 Harbin

Institute of Technology is conducting research on the topic,
but does not publish its progress.
Governments’ use of new technologies affects their relative power
and influence in the modern world. Nations that innovate faster
and more effectively often build and sustain an advantage over
their rivals. In such a competition, ML has the potential to be a
game-changing technology, and both China and the United States
are racing to exploit its power. More narrowly, the application of
ML techniques to traditional cyber operations may prove to be
transformative, altering operations’ practice and amplifying their
potency. Since these operations are a fundamental part of modern
statecraft, having an operational advantage, even if only for a
moment, can yield lasting gains for governments. By examining the
research at select universities, analysts and decisionmakers can
better determine how China may try to apply AI and machine
learning techniques to cyber operations in search of this
advantage. If the cross-pollination from academic research teams
to fielded operations occurs for ML-enabled cyber capabilities as it
did in earlier cyber operations, then understanding the depth and
breadth of the schools’ work can shed light on future operational
developments and their potential security impacts.

Introduction
Professor Gu Jian (顾剑) splashed cash on whoever could help him.
Standard password cracking techniques and dictionary attacks
served no use for the professor—he needed innovators. Only the
top talent would do and he did what he could to lure it out. “Believe
it or not, our professor has a lot of money,” one student said of
Professor Gu.3 With payouts up to RMB 500K ($73,000), the
professor threw large sums of money at his problems.4 “Our
teacher says if no one can crack it this time, then he’ll increase the
money on offer,” the student said.5 Outside of his classroom,
Professor Gu scouted talent at hacking competitions on Hainan
University’s campus and encouraged students to attend by offering
cash prizes from one of his shell companies. That company, Hainan
Xiandun Technology Company, even listed its address of
incorporation as the university’s library.6
As a former PLA officer in the Guangzhou Military Region’s
Political Department, Professor Gu was a natural choice for
Hainan’s State Security Bureau when it sought to stand up its
hacking operations. Gu Jian served as a professor in the
Information Security Department of Hainan University and used his
position to run state-sponsored hacking operations. Beginning in
2013, Professor Gu posted job listings on internal university
boards, hosted hacking competitions where he scouted for talent,
and offered bounties on technical capabilities to his students and
coworkers. By the time Intrusion Truth—a cybersecurity blog
rumored to be a front for a national intelligence agency—outed
Professor Gu and his government contact in early 2020, his
hacking team had already victimized companies in the U.S. defense
industrial base.7 Cybersecurity professionals assigned Professor
Gu’s state-sponsored team a standardized designation, Advanced
Persistent Threat 40 (APT40); it was a sign that the hackers were
notable operators.
Professor Gu’s experience running a state-sponsored APT is not an
aberration. Both the Ministry of State Security (MSS) and the
People’s Liberation Army (PLA) have used universities and their
employees to support and conduct cyber operations for many
years.8 Six schools deserve particular scrutiny.
Center for Security and Emerging Technology | 5

The universities analyzed in this report were chosen because of
their connections to known hacking groups. Universities qualified
for inclusion if they: 1) previously conducted cyber operations
(Hainan University, Southeast University, and Shanghai Jiao Tong
University), 2) partnered with specific divisions of the security
services that conduct cyber operations (Xidian University), or 3)
were noted by US cyber threat intelligence companies as places of
recruitment for APTs (Zhejiang University and Harbin Institute of
Technology). Other universities, aside from these six, also
contribute to China’s cyber capabilities albeit without apparent
connection to specific APTs, thus falling below the threshold for
analysis of this report.9
China’s Science of Military Strategy, a government publication of
military doctrine and strategic thinking put forward by the PLA’s
Academy of Military Science, has long emphasized the integration
of civilians into the military’s information warfare operations, the
domain that includes cyber operations.10 The CCP’s strategy of
military-civil fusion aims to leverage private resources for
government use. Recent reporting shows that the MSS tasks some
companies to analyze bulk data collected from cyber espionage
operations—exemplifying one way MCF is put into practice in the
cyber domain.11 Whereas other countries’ security services may
contract with consenting and interested companies, nongovernment entities in China accept working with the CCP as a
cost of doing business; rejecting the Party’s requests may be the
death-knell for an organization. As China’s security services
compete for access to information, cyber operators can leverage
close relationships with universities to develop new tactics,
techniques, and procedures. This quest for new capabilities pushes
academics and operators into new areas of research. The
integration of universities and state-sponsored espionage shortens
the time required to turn academic research into operational
capabilities and creates a window into operators’ possible research
priorities. Understanding current research can provide insights, and
potentially indicators, into possible future capabilities and
intentions. Research applying machine learning to offensive
techniques and defensive tactics offers China’s security services
new tools to leverage; research on the attack and defense of AI

Center for Security and Emerging Technology | 6

systems opens a new battlespace for contest. Competition begets
innovation.
It is not this research, in and of itself, that warrants attention.
Research on machine learning and AI for cybersecurity, and the
attack and defense of those same systems are normal topics for
computer science researchers for good reason: machine learning
offers new tools for cybersecurity professionals to deploy. MLbased cyber threat detection, malware classification, and
inspection of encrypted data flows all promise future gains for
cybersecurity. By the same token, AI systems themselves must be
secured from attackers. Vulnerable systems proliferate as
companies monetize algorithms and governments deploy new
tools. Defending these systems requires anticipating how they may
be attacked, so researching attack methodologies is one way to
gain insight into adversaries’ efforts, which in turn could inform
efforts to bolster defenses. This dual-use nature of cybersecurity
research tints the lens of analysis.
This paper examines the relationship between China’s statebacked hacking teams, six universities, and the AI/ML research they
do that may affect future cyber operations. To do that, this paper
draws on open sources12 to study the relationship between the
MSS, the PLA’s Strategic Support Force (PLASSF), which is
responsible for computer network operations and technical
reconnaissance, and these institutions.13 The author examined
university webpages for each school’s cybersecurity (网络空间安全)
program and information security (信息安全) program. Faculty web
pages with biographical information claiming connection to the
security services, and research related to AI/ML are analyzed
below. University or government documents from public file
sharing sites, such as Baidu Wenku, bearing related search terms
are also included. Findings regarding academic papers from the
China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database reflect
papers published by each school’s respective degree programs that
the CSET data team has determined to be related to AI/ML.

Hainan University (海南大学)
Connections to the Security Services
Hainan University employed a professor conducting cyber
operations with APT40, which Intrusion Truth attributed to the
Hainan Bureau of the MSS (see introduction).15
Research on AI/ML + Cybersecurity
Websites for the Hainan University cybersecurity school and
related research institutions either failed to load or required
passwords to access. It is unclear why the Hainan University
Cybersecurity Department’s website is password protected—an
uncommon security protocol compared to other universities
examined in this report. The increased security measures may well
have been implemented following the revelation of the school’s
association with APT40, but this is not easily discernable.
A search of available academic papers uncovered one paper
published on using ensemble learning methods, a machine learning
framework, to create an early warning system for distributed denial
of service attacks.16 Hainan University has not published any other
research related to AI/ML and cybersecurity.

Southeast University (东南大学)
Connections to the Security Services
Professor Song Yubo (宋宇波) and Beijing TopSec, a company
known to provide cybersecurity services to the PLA and MSS,
hosted a hacking competition in early 2014 for Southeast
University students.17 Unlike normal capture-the-flag competitions
where participants hack other teams for points, Professor Song
offered students a real-world opportunity to earn points and gain
prestige by attempting to access the network of a U.S. DoD
contractor, VAE, Inc.18
In preparing the computer infrastructure for the hacking
competition, Professor Song accidentally left a trail of indicators
connecting him, the competition, and the VAE operation. Song set
Center for Security and Emerging Technology | 9

up websites meant to fool VAE employees into giving up their
credentials in the days leading up to the competition; VAE
confirmed spearphishing attempts at the same time as the
competition.19 Not only did the timing of the websites align with
the competition, but Song used the same registration company and
naming conventions to create both the competition registration
website and the websites used for the hacking operation. Such
overlapping procedures could be coincidental; one registration
company can serve many clients. But, Song also made an
operational security error when compiling his malware, by
accidentally programming his malware to call back to the same IP
address he used to register the competition’s website, connecting
him, the competition, and the malicious websites.20
Months after the attempted attacks on VAE, Inc., the same
malware from the competition was found on a website targeting
Anthem Insurance employees.21 The 2019 DOJ indictment of
Chinese hackers for the Anthem Insurance hacks did not name
Song, however. The relative exclusivity of the malware and its
connection to Deep Panda, the Crowdstrike designation for a
Chinese state-sponsored hacking team, suggests that Song and
the team that hacked Anthem Insurance had access to the same
tools—either through sharing or centralized distribution.22
Moreover, Song registered the malicious VAE websites using the
name of a Marvel comic book character—the same theme used to
register infrastructure for the hack of the U.S. Office of Personnel
Management, another major Chinese operation.23
Aside from Song Yubo, Southeast University has a strong
institutional relationship with China’s information warfare
programs. A 2012 report prepared for the U.S.-China Economic
and Security Review Commission by Northrop Grumman
determined that Southeast University faculty—including Song24—
received regular funding from five programs for “the modernization
of state secrecy, the technical professionalization of the PLA, and
the continuing development of information conflict capabilities.”25
As of 2012, funds from these five programs—the 863 National
High Technology Research and Development Program (国家高技术
研究发展计划), the 973 National Key Basic Research Program (国家
高技术研究发展计划), the National 242 Information Security
Center for Security and Emerging Technology | 10

Program (国家 242 信息安全计划项目), Ministry of State Security
115 Program (国家安全部 115), and the National S219 Information
Security Application Demonstration Project (国家 S219 信息安全应
用示范工程)—were selectively distributed to a small group of
universities; it is unclear if these programs are still disbursing
funds. Only two other universities, Harbin University and Zhejiang
University, received funding from all five information warfare
projects as of 2012—both are tied to APTs and covered in this
report.
Southeast University continues to build upon its relationship with
the security services in the information domain. A university
webpage touts Southeast University partnering with the PLA
Strategic Support Force to establish the Purple Mountain Internet
Communications and Security Research Lab (网络通信与安全紫金
山实验室), which opened in 2018.26 PLA SSF researchers and
Southeast University faculty at the lab work together on “important
strategic requirements”, computer operating systems, and
interdisciplinary cybersecurity research.27 In the same year, the
university established a “security self-investigation and selfcorrection working group” for the cybersecurity academy’s
“laboratory and important venues”—perhaps to guard against
insider threats to research.28 Other engagements revolve around
hands-on learning and job placement. Southeast University
connects students to the security services via job postings and
research positions. One post-doctoral position with the MSS 13th
division works on “APT attack detection, and vulnerability
discovery and exploitation.”29 A web page for prospective students
highlights that graduates often go on to work for the MSS, among
other possible careers.30
Research on AI/ML + Cybersecurity
Professor Song, the academic who facilitated the VAE, Inc. hacking
competition, is now researching how to use machine learning for
anomaly detection—a technique that looks for unusual patterns of
network behavior.31 Song is just one of many Southeast University
professors who has accepted funding from any of the three
secretive funding programs for information security research. Dr.
Jiang Rui (蒋睿), a three-time recipient of MSS 115 Program (国家
Center for Security and Emerging Technology | 11

安全部 115) funding, is currently researching data protection
technology for distributed machine learning systems on behalf of
the Ministry of Public Security.32 Other professors also received
MSS 115 Program (国家安全部 115) or National 242 Information
Security Program (国家 242 信息安全计划项目), but do not conduct
ML-related cybersecurity research.
Another group of Southeast University faculty also research ML
and cybersecurity, but do not appear to receive government
funding for their research. Li Tao (李涛) focuses on smartphone
security and vulnerabilities, and claims to research AI applications
for cybersecurity, but has only listed one publication related to AI.33
Qin Zhongyuan (秦中元) researches AI for malware classification
and attack detection systems—both applications help defenders
fortify networks.34 Another professor, Yang Wang (杨望), invites
student applicants to assist with his research on cyber threat
intelligence, cyberattack attribution technologies, and security
challenges for AI systems.35 According to Yang’s webpage,
applicants for research positions should be familiar with machine
learning, cybersecurity posture awareness technology, and threat
intelligence modeling and analysis.36 The requisite skills for
applicants and declared direction for the research project—
automated cybersecurity response (自动化安全响应)—suggests a
focus on ML-based anomaly detection and threat attribution
technologies.

Shanghai Jiao Tong University (上海交通大学)
Connections to the Security Services
The first murmurs of Shanghai Jiao Tong University’s (SJTU)
relationship with state-sponsored hackers date back as far as
2010. In an article published by The New York Times, unnamed
military contractors provided evidence that someone at SJTU was
conducting network operations against foreign targets, including
Google and the U.S. government.37 Three years passed before
evidence of the relationship surfaced again.

Center for Security and Emerging Technology | 12

In 2013, Mandiant published its ground-breaking APT1 report that
named PLA Unit 61398 as an Advanced Persistent Threat to the
U.S. government and non-Chinese companies. Based on the
attribution of attacks to Unit 61398, investigative reporters at
Reuters identified three computer science articles that SJTU
academics co-authored with members of Unit 61398.38 One of the
academic authors implausibly claimed he was unaware of his coauthor’s ties to the PLA—insisting that the co-author was a
graduate student—even though a military unit designation
appeared next to the operator’s name on the paper.39 The technical
articles demonstrated that the academics were directly
contributing to research that could be used for network operations
and were doing that research alongside people from military units
carrying out those operations. The Reuters journalists also
determined that SJTU’s School of Information Security Engineering
(上海交通大学信息安全工程学院) was co-located on an
“Information Security Engineering Base” run by the PLA,
establishing another clear connection between SJTU and the PLA.
Following the DOJ indictments of Unit 61398 a year later, another
report found that one of the hackers had used his university email
address to register infrastructure used in a hacking campaign.40
Rumors about SJTU and its connection to Chinese government
cyber operations evolved into irrefutable facts over the four years
from 2010 to 2014.
This report finds that the relationship between SJTU and statesponsored hacking teams almost certainly continues today. The
SJTU’s Cyberspace Security Science and Technology Research
Institute (上海交通大学网络安全技术研究院) stands out for its
potential impact on cyber operations and as a vehicle for
cooperation. The Network Confrontation and Information System
Security Testing (网络攻防与信息系统安全检测) project works on
“network and information system testing and evaluation, security
testing for intelligent connected networks, APT attack testing and
defense, and key cyber range technology.”41 Research priorities,
like “APT attack testing and defense,” explicitly state the intent to
develop offensive and defensive technologies for APT (read:
government-backed) cyber operations. Other enumerated areas of
research include “password cracking, social engineering, and

Center for Security and Emerging Technology | 13

creating active honeynets.”42 Password cracking and social
engineering are used to gain unauthorized network access and are
offensively oriented. While penetration testers can use these
tactics against consenting organizations to improve their defensive
posture, the institute makes no mention of providing such services.
The most likely application is for offensive cyber operations.
Additionally, SJTU hosts a few AI research organizations, including
the AI Security Laboratory, whose mission is to increase the
security and defenses of ML algorithms.43
Besides this research, the biographies of two professors stand out
for their stated impact on the security services. Dr. Qiu Weidong’s (
邱卫东) research on AI and graphical processing unit
optimization—a key component for training AI systems—led to the
widespread adoption of his cryptographic techniques by "many
core national security ministries," presumably including the security
services.44 Another professor, Dr. Chen Xiaohua (陈晓桦), served as
the Executive Deputy Director (常务副主任)—likely second or third
in the chain of command—of the national-level MSS 13th Bureau,
known publicly as the China Information Technology Security
Evaluation Center (CNITSEC), before becoming a professor.45
Standard-setting cryptographical research and experience running
a bureau of an intelligence service are good indicators of SJTU’s
reputation among cybersecurity professionals in China.
Research on AI/ML + Cybersecurity
Researchers at Shanghai Jiao Tong University published seven
papers on using AI for defensive purposes over the last five years.
Researchers published on defensive ML applications such as
identifying malicious URLs46, inspecting web traffic to identify
botnets47, attributing certain types of DDOS attacks48, and a litany
of specialized intrusion detection systems.49 Other research topics
have dual-use applications. One paper funded by the Ministry of
Public Security researched the application of machine learning for
static vulnerability analysis of software.50 Vulnerability analysis
finds weaknesses in software that can be patched by defenders or
exploited by attackers; how vulnerabilities are used after their
discovery is up to the user. Another paper proposed a machine
learning model that could differentiate Tor web traffic from other
Center for Security and Emerging Technology | 14

traffic—a tool that would allow a state with comprehensive
surveillance and collection capabilities to isolate otherwise
obscured internet connections; China has obvious incentives to use
such a tool.51 Other work sheds the veneer of dual-use research
and benefits only attackers. A paper published in 2019 increased
the accuracy of password guessing attacks by using a machine
learning model to generate password attempts.52
In addition to the work of individual professors, the Network
Confrontation and Information System Security Testing (网络攻防
与信息系统安全检测) project, mentioned above, also conducts
research on the use of AI and machine learning for computer
network attack and defense. Though sourcing for this assertion is
limited, the documents available speak volumes. The MSS 13th
Bureau published an article by the director of the SJTU research
institute in its Cyberspace Strategy Forum periodical.53 The article
considers the potential offensive and defensive applications of AI in
computer network operations, as well as the vulnerabilities of AI
systems themselves. In one section, the director—concurrently the
director for the National Engineering Laboratory for Information
Content Analysis Technology (信息内容分析技术国家工程实验室)—
highlights using AI to repair software vulnerabilities, support
network attack and defense, and find software vulnerabilities for
exploitation in the malware development process.54 The piece
concludes by making two arguments. First, AI holds potential for
defensive cybersecurity applications like intrusion detection, threat
intelligence management, and the ability to construct intelligentsecure networks (构建网络安全智能模型). Second, it contends that
further research on AI is the solution to AI’s current vulnerabilities.
The publication of the article by the MSS 13th Bureau
demonstrates the service’s interest in such capabilities and
illustrates the deference it pays to the research and analysis of
SJTU faculty.
Besides the publication, two other pieces of evidence point
towards research on ML applications for cyber operations by the
Cyberspace Security Science and Technology Research Institute.
First, a recent job posting for a training program manager (培训业务主
管) gave preference to applicants with a background in
cybersecurity and a strong understanding of AI security.55 Second,
Center for Security and Emerging Technology | 15

the description of responsibilities for part of the program includes
“AI-based vulnerability discovery and testing,” the same offensive
application the director noted in his article.56 Taken together, the
high-level publication on AI and cybersecurity in an MSS periodical,
the job posting seeking applicants with a cross-disciplinary
background, and the research institute’s description of its own
work provides strong evidence that researchers are working on AI
for cyber offensive and defensive purposes. In light of one program
conducting “APT attack testing and defense” and SJTU’s past
relationship with PLA cyber operators, it is reasonable to conclude
such research could directly support state-sponsored hacking.

Xidian University (西安电子科技大学)
Connections to the Security Services
Guangdong ITSEC, a division of the MSS 13th Bureau and the
managing organization for APT3, started working with Xidian
University in 2017 to offer a jointly administered graduate program
under the Network and Information Security School (网络与信息安
全学院).57 Xidian University awards degrees and handles
admissions; Guangdong ITSEC facilitates hands-on education and
pairs graduate students with MSS employees serving as mentors.58
Together, Guangdong ITSEC and Xidian University graduate
students pursue research projects that meet the “actual needs” (实
际需求) of Guangdong ITSEC—solving technical problems to
enable the MSS’s work. The relationship between Guangdong
ITSEC and Xidian University is unusual; not only is the jointlyadministered degree a novel program, but the two institutions are
located more than 1,000 miles apart. Xidian University’s
involvement may be explained by Guangdong ITSEC’s collection
priorities. APT3 changed its mission to targeting residents of Hong
Kong in 2015.59 Practicing offensive cyber skills on Hong Kongers
is no different than an internship with the Ministry of Public
Security since China considers Hong Kong to be an “internal affair.”
This is conjecture, however. There are no reports that Xidian
University supported past operations and this is the first report
establishing the university’s relationship with the Guangdong
ITSEC.

Center for Security and Emerging Technology | 16

Xidian University students are not limited to just one division of the
MSS 13th Bureau, however. The university also established a joint
research laboratory and internship program with Shaanxi ITSEC in
2017. The two committed to “jointly launch information security
assurance and posture evaluation services for China, Shaanxi
Province, and Shaanxi's prefecture-level cities" among many other
responsibilities.60 Shaanxi ITSEC is not connected to any publicly
known APT groups or hacking campaigns.
Xidian University’s relationship with PLA information warfare units
extends at least a decade. In 2011, Xidian University established a
relationship with the 3PLA and 4PLA, both now under the PLA
Strategic Support Force, when it constructed the Collaborative
Innovation Center of Information Sensing and Understanding (信息
感知技术协同创新中心).61 This project was a continuation of its
historic ties to the CCP—Mao Zedong established the forerunner to
Xidian University in 1931.62
Research on AI/ML + Cybersecurity
Two Xidian University professors claim an affiliation with China’s
security services and are conducting research on AI and
cybersecurity.
Dr. Zhang Yuqing (张玉清) joined Xidian University after having
first served as the director of the National Computer Network
Intrusion Prevention Center (国家计算机网络入侵防范中心主任), a
government body tasked with securing computer networks, and
serving as the Deputy Director of the National Engineering
Experimental Laboratory for Technology to Prevent and Cure
Computer Viruses (计算机病毒防治技术国家工程实验室副主任).63
Zhang’s research at Xidian is focused on network confrontation,
vulnerability discovery and exploitation, and the intersection of AI
and cybersecurity.64 In his most recently published academic paper,
Zhang and researchers from the National Computer Network
Intrusion Prevention Center—his former employer—surveyed more
than 200 papers on using AI for cybersecurity tasks.65 The paper
analyzed possible applications of ML for data mining, vulnerability
discovery and exploitation, and automated patching of software
vulnerabilities. Zhang and his colleagues determined that using AI
Center for Security and Emerging Technology | 17

for automated vulnerability discovery was likely the most useful
application and made recommendations for future research to
overcome the technology’s (2018) limitations at the time. The
project would likely prove useful to one of its funders, the
Unclassified Projects Program at the Key State Laboratory for
Information Security (信息安全国家重点实验室的开放课题), which
could use the research to inform grant distributions to other
academics working on ML and cybersecurity. The actual impact of
the report is unknown, however.66
A second academic, Dr. Yang Chao (杨超), has active connections
to the security services and conducts research on AI applications
for cybersecurity.67 While at Xidian University, Dr. Yang has
submitted more than 20 software vulnerabilities to China’s
National Vulnerability Database (CNNVD, 国家信息安全漏洞库)—a
division of the MSS 13th Bureau. Fifteen of these received
certification from the government as critical vulnerabilities, though
most were apparently related to payment systems within China.68
His work on cybersecurity earned him a national defense research
project funded by the now-defunct PLA General Armaments
Department Development Fund and a current “high-level
consulting position” with the MSS 13th Bureau Xibei office.69 Yang
describes his research as including “data-driven AI intelligent cyber
threat detection and [developing a] “hunter” defense system
architecture; AI and big data analysis-based detection of
malignancies in encrypted traffic; machine learning-based
encrypted traffic (SSL, Tor, VPN, ShadowSocks) / private internet
protocol recognition and investigation; data analysis and machine
learning-based cyberspace virtual persona recognition, matching,
and investigation.”70 Each of Yang’s research topics tightly
intertwines ML and cybersecurity and could be put to good use in
his consulting position at the MSS 13th Bureau’s Xibei office.
Academics at Xidian University without acknowledged or known
ties to the security services are also conducting similar research. A
paper focused on defensive research published in 2019 proposed
and demonstrated using machine learning to classify malware
samples based on patterns in behavior.71 The resulting model could
be used to detect attacks from new malware with behaviors similar
to that of older, known malware. Research using machine learning
Center for Security and Emerging Technology | 18

for behavioral detection of new attacks is a common theme in
current research on AI and cybersecurity.72 Another Xidian
University paper from 2017 proposed a similar ML-based solution
to classifying malware, though that research focused on
overcoming inadequate training data.73
Other academics are conducting research on less defensive, more
dual-use topics. An article from 2019 compared algorithms that
conduct membership interference attacks on ML systems, an
exploit that allows attackers to determine if a given piece of data
was part of the model’s training data.74 For example, a membership
interference attack on a facial recognition system may allow the
attacker to determine if the system can identify a particular face.75
Though the researchers qualified their research by demonstrating
how to defend against such attacks, the paper concluded with
examples of attacking commercially available algorithms to
evaluate which data sets had been used to train targeted models.

Zhejiang University (浙江大学)
Connections to the Security Services
Zhejiang University is a highly-respected, internationally renowned
school for cybersecurity studies. Unsurprisingly, the PLA vigorously
recruited graduates of its program at the time Mandiant published
its APT1 report in 2013.76 A report prepared for the U.S.-China
Economic and Security Review Commission by Northrop Grumman
found that Zhejiang University received funding from three
secretive programs for information security research: China’s
National 242 Information Security Program (国家 242 信息安全计
划项目), the Ministry of State Security 115 Program (国家安全部
115), and the National s219 Information Security Application
Demonstration Project (国家 s219 信息安全应用示范工程).77 The
report also concludes that universities which received these funds
were selected to conduct “sensitive research and development
with information security and information warfare applications.”78
Though never tied to a specific hacking campaign, this report finds
that Zhejiang University has collaborated on research with
members of the PLA SSF. Zhejiang University academics coCenter for Security and Emerging Technology | 19

authored a research paper with members of PLA Unit 61646 in
2018.79 Also known as the Air Reconnaissance Bureau, Unit 61646
was originally organized under the PLA General Staff Department’s
2nd Department and responsible for military intelligence until its
reorganization in 2015-16.80 The joint paper evaluated SM4, a
then-common encryption protocol that played an “important role as
a national encryption standard” in China.81 Together, Zhejiang
University academics and members of Unit 61646 concluded that
SM4 encryption protocol is weak and easy to circumvent.
Research on AI/ML + Cybersecurity
Classes taught at, and research conducted by, Zhejiang University
suggest the school’s graduates are well prepared for jobs involving
cyber operations, making them great recruits for China’s security
services and national champion companies alike. Indeed, the joint
Zhejiang University-Fudan University team beat the team from
Carnegie Mellon in the 2020 DEFCON Capture-the-Flag
competition.82
Cybersecurity is not the only relevant area of focus at Zhejiang
University, as the school is also teaching undergraduate students
how to attack and defend AI/ML systems.83 Under its Applied
Security curriculum, Zhejiang University teaches AI-related courses
including: Algorithm and Model Security, Backdoors in Models,
Data Poisoning, Adversarial Example Attacks, Measures for
Defending Against Adversarial Example Attacks, and Certifiable
Security for AI (人工智能可证明性安全).84 In addition, Zhejiang
University’s Applied Security program is conducting research on
“malicious machine learning” (恶意机器学习).85
Each of these topics is central to protecting or attacking AI
systems. Data poisoning attacks target the training data of a
model; manipulating the inputs in such a way that the deployed
system fails to function properly.86 Undetected data poisoning
attacks can slow the development of a system, increasing costs
and undermining its functionality. Other vulnerabilities allow
attackers to make models fail in specific, predictable ways.
Backdoors in models allow for the attackers to designate a specific
outcome given a certain trigger.87 A backdoor attack against a
Center for Security and Emerging Technology | 20

facial recognition model could allow anyone wearing a purple hat
to be recognized as a particular person, for example. Defending
against these types of attacks is critical for any organization or
business integrating AI models into operations.
In the course of their degrees on cybersecurity, AI and information
security at Zhejiang University, students pick up some
government-focused skills along the way. The program offers
courses on intelligence88 entitled: “the evolution and definition of
strategic intelligence, the relationship between induction and
deduction in intelligence research, intelligence classification, and
crafting [intelligence] reports."89 Understanding the intelligence
cycle and writing intelligence products is likely to be of little
relevance to employees outside the national security sector.
Combined with classes on AI vulnerabilities—which require
familiarity with how systems can be attacked—the evidence
suggests that Zhejiang University students are well-prepared for a
job in the security services.90
Full-time faculty at Zhejiang University who teach AI/ML attack and
defense classes are on the cutting-edge of research in the area. Dr.
Ji Shouling (纪守领), an international participant on eight US
National Science Foundation-funded research projects, recipient of
the China’s 1000 Young Talents Program (2017) and the Zhejiang
1000 Talent Program (2016), has his own research institute at
Zhejiang University which conducts research on AI for
cybersecurity.91 In an arrangement that typifies the issues of
China’s talent programs, Ji simultaneously holds a research faculty
position at Georgia Institute of Technology. One non-NSF paper
published by Ji proposes a tool called “VulnSniper,” which uses
neural networks to find new software vulnerabilities.92 It is one
example from dozens of papers published by Ji’s research program
at Zhejiang University.
Dr. Yang Ziqi (杨子祺), another professor in the cybersecurity
program, focuses his research on the attack and defense of AI
systems. After receiving his doctorate from Singapore National
University, Yang conducted research for the Singapore
Cybersecurity Agency National Lab, Kaspersky Labs, and Huawei.
Yang’s research on AI security includes model inversion,
Center for Security and Emerging Technology | 21

membership interference, adversarial attack and defense, and
backdoors in models.93 Membership interference attacks pair well
with Yang’s other research into model inversion of commercially
available facial recognition systems.94 Together, these two
techniques can determine whether a particular face is recognized
by a targeted facial recognition system. Other applications of
Yang’s research include using AI to trace the origins of malware
binaries based on information about the compiling author.95
In addition to full-time professors conducting research, Zhejiang
University has hosted many guest lectures on attacking AI systems
and defending their vulnerabilities. Topics from guest lecturers
have included: Neural Network Inversion in Adversarial Settings96,
Attack and Defense of Deep Neural Network Models97, Federated
Learning-Oriented User Privacy Attacks98, Data Set Inference and
Reconstruction Attacks in Online Learning99, and Stealthy Attacks
Against Automatic Speech Recognition.100 These attacks pose
myriad problems for users of AI systems. Neural network
inversions reveal technical details about the data used to train a
specific model—potentially exposing sensitive or classified data
used in training the model.101 Other attacks, rather than exposing
information, manipulate mundane systems to the attacker’s
advantage. The presentation on “Stealthy Attacks Against
Automatic Speech Recognition” systems demonstrated how to
embed secret commands in songs, which when played, can direct
virtual assistants—like Google Home, Amazon Echo, or Apple’s
Siri—to perform certain tasks. Though research of this nature is
common in cybersecurity, the relationship between Zhejiang
University and China’s cyber operators is uncommon. Moreover, a
recent CSET report demonstrates how hard it is to defend AI
systems—vulnerabilities are pervasive and defensive techniques
are often only temporary patches.102 As more organizations and
governments deploy AI systems, the attack surface for such
techniques will grow.

Center for Security and Emerging Technology | 22

Harbin Institute of Technology (哈尔滨工业大学)
Connections to Security Services
The Mandiant APT1 report named Harbin Institute of Technology
(HIT) as a recruitment center for Chinese cyber operators in
2013.103 HIT is not alleged to have supported specific operations,
though the university’s ties to the military would make any such
support unsurprising. As one of the Seven Sons of National
Defense—a collection of universities with deep historical ties to the
defense industry and PLA—HIT has received an institutional topsecret clearance to work on military projects.104 HIT’s cybersecurity
school touts working on nine government-funded research
projects, including research done on behalf of the now-defunct
PLA General Armaments Department Key Laboratory Fund and the
MSS, among other research funders.105 Legacy webpages show
many graduates of HIT’s cybersecurity school from 2008 to 2014
went to work for the PLA’s 54th Research Institute, formerly part of
the General Staff Department’s 4th Department (Electronic
Intelligence, or ELINT), an organization folded into the PLA
Strategic Support Force in 2015.106 The U.S. DOJ indicted four
members of the 54th Research Institute in 2020 for the 2017
Equifax hack.107
Research on AI/ML + Cybersecurity
Academics based at the Harbin Institute of Technology published
few research articles on ML applications for cybersecurity or AI
vulnerabilities. Instead, the vast majority of its faculty’s publications
(49 of 51) examined the application of AI to other fields, including a
significant focus on the medical field. The two papers published on
ML and cybersecurity rehashed recurrent themes in the field. One
group of researchers built a machine learning model to detect and
categorize software vulnerabilities.108 The other publication
proposed using AI to create an intrusion detection system based
on behavior analysis.109
The relative scarcity of publications on ML and cybersecurity topics
is surprising, given HIT’s reputation as a cutting-edge
cybersecurity school. It may well be the case that the university’s
Center for Security and Emerging Technology | 23

institutional top-secret clearance prevents the publication of such
research. Another CSET report on China’s defense technology
workforce found that China’s central government designated a
Microsoft-HIT Artificial Intelligence and Machine Translation Joint
Laboratory as a Key State Laboratory in 2006.110 Moreover, the
same report found that Microsoft Research Asia worked with HIT
to create its computer science curriculum and provided training to
professors in 2018 and 2019 on AI and natural language
processing technology.111 In fact, the presence of such international
partnerships may be the reason that HIT shies away from
publishing or even conducting such research.
But there are more indicators that HIT is performing, but not
publishing, research on AI and cybersecurity. The Computer
Application/Cyberspace Security Research Center, an affiliate of
the cybersecurity school, conducts “research on key technologies in
privacy-protecting machine learning.”112 Though the phrase is
ambiguous, other sources use the same phrase when discussing
the issue of ML model security.113 Here, the description of HIT’s
research center denotes work on securing machine learning models
from attacks that may divulge information from training data or
other aspects of the model. To secure these models, researchers
attack newly-developed defenses to test their efficacy. The
acknowledgment of defensive research is also a tacit
acknowledgment of offensive capabilities, though the attack
methodologies used are not necessarily new or developed inhouse.

Center for Security and Emerging Technology | 24

Conclusions
Examination of China’s AI/ML research and computer network
operations to date demonstrates that six key universities play a
major role in not only building technical competencies, but also in
moving the research out of the lab and operationalizing it.
Research currently conducted at these six universities
demonstrates interest in both sides of the AI/ML and cybersecurity
divide—ML-based offensive and defensive techniques, and the
attack and defense of AI systems themselves. In addition to
technical research from all six institutions, two of the schools
published high-level strategic papers on the intersection of
machine learning and cybersecurity. Xidian University’s paper,
funded by the Key State Laboratory for Information Security
Unclassified Projects Fund, conducted a wide-ranging review of
current (2018) research, determining machine learning could make
a significant impact on vulnerability discovery and exploitation.114
The conclusions of that paper were reiterated in an MSS
publication written by faculty from Shanghai Jiao Tong University,
where affiliated programs are conducting research on AI-based
vulnerability discovery and “APT attack and defense.”115 The state
of technical research in China is such that work on machine
learning and computer network operations has moved from the
research lab to strategic policy publications.
The close relationships between universities and the state shortens
the path to operationalizing new techniques and provides the
security services quick access to talented researchers. As nations
and organizations deploy AI systems with unknown vulnerabilities,
China’s hacking teams will have new avenues of attack.
Conversely, China’s government and private sector will also seek to
defend their own systems. Enhanced protection of China’s
computer networks and AI systems will be at least one outcome of
conducting this research. Though research benefits both offensive
and defensive applications, the relationships of these institutions
with the security services augur the use of such knowledge in
future hacking operations.

For example, the Beijing Institute of Technology posted a message of thanks to
its Information and Electronics Program from the Ministry of State Security for
their “significant contribution” to its work. (https://perma.cc/56S5-SB2E) In late
2020, the US Bureau of Industry and Security placed the school on its End-User
list for acquiring technology for the PLA. Similarly, Sichuan University touts
providing zero-day vulnerabilities to “relevant government ministries” on its
homepage. (https://perma.cc/SQ3K-LZKQ) Small, ad-hoc contributions are likely
the most common way universities support China’s computer network
operations. Still other schools’ contributions fall somewhere between supplying
vulnerabilities and setting up shell companies. Tsinghua University computers
conducted network reconnaissance on US targets ahead of a trade meeting, but
the university was not connected to a persistent campaign or entity.
(https://perma.cc/2MZ4-Q87F) This one-off type of operation may be indicative
of a professor moonlighting for extra income or a student trying to pad their
resume for future jobs—such activity does not constitute an Advanced
Persistent Threat.
