Cyber Reports – 16/02/2022

1 Introduction
Beginning in January 2022, there was a series of attacks on numerous organizations in
Ukraine spanning the government, the military, non-governmental organizations (NGOs),
with the primary intent of exfiltrating sensitive information and maintaining access.
Based on these new details and Telsy's threat hunt, we uncovered several links that
strongly support the idea that these attacks were part of a larger campaign that has been
running for a few months and has undergone several evolutions.
In this way we have mapped the various clusters and in particular three chains of infection,
composed of a series of techniques and procedures, with several significant elements that
we consider important to better understand the various phases implemented.
One of the most used access vectors in these campaigns are spear-phishing emails with
malicious attachments. Phishing attachments contain a first-stage payload that
downloads and executes additional payloads. The main payload provided by the malware
is an infostealer written in AutoIt compiled (OutSteel). Its main goal is to steal files from
the victim's machine by uploading them to a default Command and control (C2) server.
The element detected in these latter chains is the downloader used to load the infostealer
“Outsteel”. In the past this was loaded by the SaintBot tool while in these campaigns, it is
loaded by the BabaDeda crypter.
Based on victimology and the fact that this attack attempts to steal files from government
entities, it is assumed to be a state-sponsored group.
Some evidence suggests that these activities are carried out by a hacker group called
“Lorec53” as namede by the security firm “NSFocus”. The group is suspected of being
employed by other high-level espionage organisations to conduct espionage attacks,
targeting government employees in Georgia and Ukraine. This group uses the infostealer
"Outsteel" and the downloader "LorecCPL", both of which have overlapping code with the
same artefacts identified in the campaigns analysed in this report. We can therefore
assume that the BabaDeda crypter is also one of the tools in use by this group.

2 Analysis
Telsy detected several infection chains starting with different initial stages: document
template, LNK file or a CPL file representing a new type of downloader very similar to a
shellcode in the way the stack is used.
The second phase uses the BabaDeda crypter to run the infostealer called OutSteel.
BabaDeda Crypter is an evasive malware that acts like an installer and executes a
shellcode stored encrypted in a file usually, xml or pdf, dropped by the installer self. The
main binary of BabaDeda Crypter it’s a malicious binary, compiled with text segment
writable, that has only the purpose to load the 1st malicious library.
The first malicious DLL side loaded decrypt the shellcode storing it in the text section of
the main binary and loads/execute the secondary malicious library in another thread then
return to the decrypted shellcode.

Cyber Reports – 16/02/2022

The decrypted shellcode represents the real payload embedded in the installer by the
threat actor while the 2nd malicious library can embed every kind of malware. In the
samples that we found the 2nd library is used sometime as downloader and in other cases
as thread to achieve persistence, it depends by the stage.

likely, by the same threat actor.

Cyber Reports – 16/02/2022

2.1 Double BabaDeda crypter downloaded from LNK or docm template
This infection chain, which can be placed in the period September / October 2021
according to the compilation times, starts with a link (LNK) or a WORD template
document that downloads the BabaDeda crypter. The BabaDeda crypter includes Outsteel
as a payload and a downloader as 2nd library.

execution process graph

The lnk file with hash 931a86f402fee99ae1358bb0b76d055b2d04518f, most likely
distributed by e-mail, named “Особливі документи СБУ.lnk” (Special documents of the
SBU.lnk) is, clearly, a decoy document for Ukrainian defense officers. This lnk file was
contained in zip archives hosted on discord.
When open it executes a PowerShell command to download and execute the first phase
from the URL: “hxxp: //3237.site/test01.exe”

The downloaded executable with hash 0d584d72fe321332df0b0a17720191ad96737f47 is
stored in the public directory and it is executed from the PowerShell self.

Cyber Reports – 16/02/2022

Instead the document with hash ac672a07c62d48c0a7f98554038913770efaef11 is a word
dotm model and starts the first phase of the infection in the same way as the lnk file,
downloading
and
executing
the
same
artifact
through
PowerShell:
hxxp://3237.site/test01.exe.

The following document header suggests that this document may have been used after
September 2021.
“Addition to the decision of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine of
September 7, 2021 "On Amendments to Personal Special Economic and Other Restrictive
Measures (Sanctions)”
The template contains a macro that on the open event drops a cmd file with a PowerShell
command inside.

The cmd file is stored in “C:\Users\Public\Documents\programtwo.cmd” and contains the
PowerShell command to download the artifact from URL “hxxp: //3237.site/test01.exe”
and save it in “C:\Users\Public\Documents\manlevel.exe”.

Cyber Reports – 16/02/2022

As in the previous LNK document the PowerShell command runs the downloaded file.
Also, the WORD template has been hosted on discord and is most likely downloaded as a
remote template from a docx released by email.

2.1.1 First Stage
Both files, lnk and WORD template, downloads the same installer has been created with
Inno Setup.

Once executed, it extracts all the components in the path:
“C:\Users\admin\AppData\Roaming\mXParser”.
The
main
executable,
named
“mathparser.exe”
whose
hash
is
26474ba449682e82ca38fef32836dcb23ee24012, is executed directly by the installer after
all the components have been extracted.
This installation is a BabaDeda crypter, i.e. a type of loader. In fact, as described in the
blog of the security company "Morphisec”, it is used to evasively load a malicious payload
stored in another file. Since the analysis cited by the blog is exhaustive, it was not
performed.
This loader was reported in November 2021 in connection with attacks against the NFT
and Crypto community. Instead, it was used in these campaigns, leading to the
8

Cyber Reports – 16/02/2022

assumption that it could be code reuse or the action of the same cybercriminal group in
favour of a state-sponsored threat actor.
Basically, the BabaDeda crypter phases are:
1. Main Binary load and run a malicious DLL;
2. The malicious DLL load and execute in another thread the second malicious DLL;
3. The first malicious DLL read and parse the shellcode and write it in the text section
of the main binary;
4. The first malicious DLL returns to the shellcode entry point;
5. The decryption shellcode has three main tasks: first, it extracts the loader shellcode
and the payload, then it decrypts them, and finally, it transfers the execution to the
decrypted loader shellcode.
6. Finally, the payload is executed.
Since the second loaded DLL and the final payload can be customised, BabaDeda crypter
can be used to load any type of installation, in fact in this particular infection chain the
first installer is intended to download and run another BabaDeda crypter. This differs from
the analysis carried out by the company Morphisec in November 2021 in which the samples
analysed were only used to directly upload malicious artefacts.
The “mathparser” installation directory contains the following malicious files:

So, the main binary before loading the library named “JxCnv40.dll” set the current
directory to the right path to be sure that side loading technique works.

This library, whit hash 7d44391b76368b8331c4f468f8ddbaf6ee5a6793, run in a thread the
second malicious library.

Cyber Reports – 16/02/2022

Basically, the first library open “manual.pdf” reads all the content, then starts a new thread
and after copy the 0x226 bytes from the file content into the main binary text section. The
main binary is compiled with text section writable, so it does not need any virtual protect
API. The shellcode taken from the file is located at a specified offset and it has a fixed size,
this means that the BabaDeda crypter is not so ductile, indeed the binary is strictly linked
to the shellcode and the file that contains the shellcode. This makes harder to re-use it
without having the BabaDeda crypter build tools. A threat actor could use it changing the
offsets manually to load another shellcode of different length from another file.
Below the routine that loads the second library:

Cyber Reports – 16/02/2022

Meanwhile the second library is executed in another thread, the final payload is decrypted
and executed in the main binary thread. The payload named Outsteel sends the
documents to be exfiltrated to the URL “hxxp://185.244.41.109:8080/upld/”.
This IP was disclosed as an IoC by the Ukrainian CERT in February 2022, although the same
has been in use since at least October 2021. The final payload was decompiled with AutoIt
tools and a code snippet follows.

The second library, with hash e1d92e085df142d703ed9fd9c65ed92562a759fa, is a mere
downloader. Its main and only purpose is to download the next stage and run it.

In particular, once executed, it runs an msiexec command to extract each component of
the installation to “C:\Users\admin\AppData\Roaming\AdoptOpenJDK\Network OpenJDK

The second library is loaded and executed.

The second library achieves the persistence creating a link file pointing to the main binary
in the start-up directory. The link file is created via COM object interface, in particular using
the IShellLinkW interface.

The start-up directory is obtained using SHGetFolderPathW() API.

.

Meanwhile the second library gains the persistence, the main thread run the real payload
after that it is decrypted as described for BabaDeda crypter. To have the final payload the
main binary has been dumped just after the decryption phase. The final payload is a
downloader that tries to download the next stage and run it in another process.

Threat actor used a particular way to check the file size. It run a stat() and checked the
size field. If it is 1 then the file and the malware is removed otherwise it is executed. The
downloaded file is executed in a new process.

On the other hand, below the function to delete itself.

Unfortunately, the C2 “hxxp://45.12.5.62/<timestamp in hex>” was not working so no
further payloads are available.

2.1.2 WhisperGate Code OVERLAP
Some similarity has been found between the final payload, especially in the self-deletion
routine. In particular the similarity is with the file having the hash
34ca75a8c190f20b8a7596afeb255f2228cb2467bd210b2637965b61ac7ea907, i.e. the file
“Wiper”.
Indeed the file wiper reported by “Unit42” in shows that the self-deletion command string
is almost identical.

Below the two strings used:
Executable
File Wiper (WhisperGate)
adfrecorder.exe
(final
payload)

Command
cmd.exe /min /C ping 111.111.111.111 -n 5 -w 10 > Nul & Del /f /q \"%s\"
cmd.exe /min /C ping 111.111.111.111 -n 1 -w 10 > Nul & Del /f /q "%s"

In the following snippet the difference between the two functions.

Although the code is quite similar, at the same time it can be quite common. Nevertheless,
the CMD command, its options and the use of the IP 111.111.111 as a whole suggest a
similarity between the two artefacts. In addition, both malware processes close after
execution of the CMD command.

2.2 BABADEDA Crypter Dropped from a new Downloader
The second infection chain analysed begins with an archive containing a file with the
extension ".cpl" that subsequently downloads the BabaDeda crypter. Based on the
compilation date of the cpl file, it is assumed that this campaign can be traced back to
November 2021.

execution process graph

In terms of analysis, looking at a CPL file is essentially identical to a DLL file. However,
unlike the latter, it is automatically run when double-clicked. This makes it similar to EXE
files; however uneducated users may be more likely to try to execute CPL files if they do
not know any better. These files with the extension CPL have code overlaid with LorecCPL
described by the security company NSFocus.
The zip archive, with hash 33ddc1b13c079001eaa3514de7354019fa4d470a, was hosted on
discord and contains the LorecCPL file with hash:
3bbe45cdcc2731c0bb4751d1098eccc50f98ef66.
The latter is named:

Basically, the code and the useful data are both in the text section. The return address in
the stack is used to insert the address of the value that will be used by the call. The
following routine is used to find the module addresses , walking the PEB structure:

Once the address of the library has been obtained, of course the necessary APIs will
actually be resolved:

Cyber Reports – 16/02/2022

The function to find the library address and to resolve the API name are used few times to
get the address of the APIs LoadLibraryW() and GetProcAddr(), respectively the addresses
are stored in the EDI and ESI registers. So further in the code when a library or a API should
be resolved the EDI/ESI register are used to call the proper API.
