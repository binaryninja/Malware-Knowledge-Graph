Background
Destructive cyberattacks and digital espionage campaigns targeting international space
programs is a growing and concerning trend. Some of the most significant cyberattacks over
the last five years have been turning points in the state of cybersecurity of international
space programs and organizations with satellite infrastructure in space.
Space exploration and the significance of having satellite infrastructure in space is a key
driver of scientific research and technological innovation. However, despite receiving billions
of dollars in funding, the digital infrastructure and information systems supporting space
programs have been impacted by significant cyberattacks from nation-state threat actors and
financially motivated cybercriminal groups. This blog aims to use open source intelligence
(OSINT) research to compile and highlight significant cybersecurity incidents impacting the
space industry that defenders should consider when securing these types of environments.

There have been a number of positive and landmark headlines recently, such as the
successful launches by SpaceX, BlueOrigin, and Boeing, SpaceX providing critical
communications infrastructure to Ukraine via Starlink, and the creation of the Space Force
and Space ISAC. Space is also rarely able to escape geopolitical tensions and, as such, the
Russian mission announced it was pulling out of the International Space Station (ISS), which
has had its share of cybersecurity issues in the past.
In 2008, prior to when the ISS switched to Linux from Windows XP, Russian cosmonauts
reportedly introduced an infected USB device to the computers aboard the space station.
The Windows XP-based laptops used by the astronauts on the ISS were infected with a virus
called W32.Gammima.AG, a malicious password-swiping computer virus. Not many
technical details about the event and the impact it had on the station's computers were
reported publicly. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) officials at the time
described the virus as a "nuisance." Adding that it is "not a frequent occurrence, but this isn't
the first time."
Digital Espionage in Space: Satellites and NASA
Satellite Turla
Satellite communications (SATCOM) can provide both TV broadcasting and access to the
internet to remote locations. This type of satellite-based internet access, however, is known
as downstream-only connection. In September 2015, Kaspersky Labs disclosed that a
Russia-based advanced persistent threat (APT) group called Turla (aka Snake or
VenomousBear) exploited weaknesses in these downstream-only satellite internet
connections. Turla would monitor downstream connections, identify active IP addresses,
select one to appear as the originating source IP during intrusions, and hijack it by hiding
malicious code within packets sent to and from the satellite. Systems compromised by Turla
would also then exfiltrate data to IP addresses of regular satellite-based internet users. Turla
used this special technique to target systems of governments, embassies, military entities,
educational institutions, research organizations, and pharmaceutical firms across the Middle
East and Africa. Turla's operations have been tied to the Russian Federal Security Service
(FSB) by Estionian intelligence services. In February 2022, German investigative reporters
disclosed the identities of two Turla developers and their ties to the Russian FSB.

NASA & Chinese Technology Theft
In December 2018, the US Department of Justice charged two Chinese nationals part of
APT10 (aka menuPass, StonePanda or POTASSIUM) that conducted a 12-year, Chinese
Ministry of State Security (MSS) global hacking spree that stole data from dozens of US
companies and government agencies in a sophisticated technology theft campaign. Two of
the victims who had hundreds of gigabytes of sensitive data and information stolen included
the NASA Goddard Space Center and the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The APT10
operators were able to use spear-phishing attachments) to deploy the PoisonIvy malware
onto the victim's computers. The emails used malicious document attachments and sender
addresses of legitimate but compromised accounts. Once installed, PoisonIvy records user
keystrokes to steal credentials and could collect relevant files and other information from
infected systems. Collected files were then added to encrypted archives and exfiltrated to
remote servers owned by APT10.

NASA & The SolarWinds Supply Chain Attack
NASA was also more recently a victim of sophisticated Russian cyber-espionage campaigns.
In December 2020, the SolarWinds supply chain attack linked to the Nobelium APT group
(aka APT29, CozyBear, or DarkHalo) was disclosed. It involved a malicious software update
for SolarWinds Orion platform that was downloaded by over 18,000 SolarWinds customers.
Nobelium had managed to compromise the SolarWinds software build environment and used
a custom implant called SUNSPOT to load the SUNBURST backdoor into the Orion software
update. The intrusion reportedly began in September 2019 and had a first attempt in October
2019 when test code was added and pushed to SolarWinds customers. To make it harder to
detect, SUNBURST's code was signed using stolen certificates from the Orion platform and it
same naming conventions as Orion’s code so SolarWinds developers would mistake it for
their own. Once installed, SUNBURST would sleep for 12-14 days before it contacted the
group’s C&C domain via DNS. SUNBURST's traffic also used the Orion Improvement
Program (OIP) protocol to blend in with legitimate SolarWinds activity. Nobelium would then
use SUNBURST to deploy additional malware, such as TEARDROP, RAINDROP, and
several others. According to the US National Security Agency (NSA) statement, around 100
nongovernment entities received follow-up activity, which included several US federal
government agencies and NASA. In January 2021, the US Office of the Director of National
Intelligence (ODNI) formally stated that the attack was orchestrated by the Russian Foreign
Intelligence Service (SVR).
Analysis: So What?
Although space exploration and research involves a lot of collaboration between
international space agencies, these intelligence agencies operate outside of and ignore
these agreements.

These types of digital espionage campaigns are orchestrated by threat actors operating
on behalf of nation-state intelligence agencies. To be able to utilize these techniques, it
requires vast resources, technically skilled researchers, and disciplined operators.
Turla, APT10, and Nobelium are the very definition of advanced persistent threats.
These groups operate constantly and stop and nothing to execute intelligence
gathering campaigns and intellectual property theft.
These types of campaigns are essentially the cyber version of traditional spying that
will always happen between nation-state rivals. It is difficult to call these types of
intrusions "attacks" because there were no destructive components. However, the
information collected in these cyber-espionage campaigns may support future
destructive offensive operations.
Destructive Cyberattacks affecting Space
".garminwasted"
Cyberattacks degrading the performance of IT systems and networks are more likely to
originate from cybercriminal threat groups than nation-state APTs. In late July 2020, Garmin,
a major manufacturer of navigation equipment - used by NASA's Ingenuity Mars Helicopter and smart devices was the victim of a WastedLocker ransomware. Garmin's cloud services,
including device syncing and geopositioning instruments used by pilots, were disabled as a
result. In its official statement, Garmin confirmed that it was the victim of the cyberattack that
interrupted online services and encrypted some internal systems. Garmin reported that there
was no evidence anyone gained unauthorized access to user data during the incident. An
anonymous Garmin employee familiar with the incident told BleepingComputer that the
ransom demand was $10 million. After a four-day global service outage, Garmin suddenly
announced that they were starting to restore services after paying the ransom to the
cybercriminals to receive a decryptor. Notably, WastedLocker has been attributed to EvilCorp
via its similarities to DoppelPaymer and BitPaymer, other ransomware families developed by
the eCrime threat group. In December 2019, EvilCorp was placed on the US OFAC
sanctions list for causing $100 million in financial damages. Therefore, paying the ransom to
EvilCorp could lead to heft fines from the US government.

World's First SATCOM Attack
One of the most destructive cyberattacks in space was against Europe's SATCOM networks
on the night of Russian invasion of Ukraine. The US and EU stated that on 24 February
2022, Russia launched cyberattacks against commercial satellite communications networks
known as KA-SAT, belonging to Viasat. The cyberattack was aimed to disrupt the Ukrainian
command and control operations, and resulted in significant spillover impacts into other
European countries, including Germany, Greece, Poland, Italy, and Hungary. Broadband
services took over one month to recover from the incident. According to Viasat, tens of
thousands of SATCOM modems were destroyed as a result and had to be replaced. The
adversaries were reportedly able to gain access via exploiting a "misconfigured VPN" and
moved laterally to the management segment of the KA-SAT network. From there, the
attackers executed commands to flash the memory of the modems, rendering them
unusable. Interestingly, researchers from cybersecurity vendor SentinelOne uncovered a
wiper malware called AcidRain designed for MIPS firmware used by the SATCOM modems
that was potentially used in the KA-SAT attack. SentinelOne researchers assess with
medium confidence that AcidRain was developed by the same malware authors as
VPNFilter, which was officially attributed to the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU),
more specifically GTsST Unit 74455, most well-known as the Sandworm Team.

Russian Space Agencies Attacked By Hacktivists
State-sponsored APT groups and organized cybercriminals are not the only perpetrators of
destructive cyberattacks against the space industry. In March 2022, a pro-Ukraine hacktivist
group known as Network Battalion 65 (aka NB65) shared via Twitter that it had launched an
attack on Roscosmos, Russia's space agency. Dmitry Rogozin, director general of
Roscosmos, later Tweeted that NB65's claims were "not true" and called them "scammers
and petty swindlers." However, the screenshots shared by NB65 allegedly belong to Russian
satellite imaging software and vehicle monitoring systems. The incident at Roscosmos was
ultimately denied by officials and unconfirmed by NB65. Also in March, a Twitter account
allegedly tied to the Anonymous collective shared that another hacktivist group known as
v0g3lSec defaced a website belonging to Russia’s Space Research Institute (IKI) and leaked
files that allegedly belong to the Russian space agency Roscosmos. One of the stolen
documents discusses the location of potential landing sites for lunar spacecraft on the
7/9

Moon's South Pole. This matches with what Russian authorities have already announced
their South Pole sites, which potentially increases the likelihood that these documents were
successfully stolen.

Analysis: So What?
Although uncommon, purely destructive cyberattacks are often the most feared. The
loss of data and access to systems can cause millions of dollars of damage to an
organization and set back operations for months or years. The most destructive attacks
often include data encrypting ransomware or data destroying wipers.
Russia has been one of the main sources of destructive cyberattacks globally. Leading
up to and during the invasion of Ukraine, Russian APT groups have deployed several
data wiping malware variants against Ukrainian government entities and Ukrainian
critical infrastructure organizations.
Offensive cyber operations perpetrated by the Sandworm Team are some of the most
dangerous in the world. It is one of the few APT groups that has successfully launched
multiple cyberattacks that had destructive kinetic affects, mostly against Ukraine.
Courses of Action
Cybersecurity experts have often warned that Russian offensive cyber operations treat
Ukraine like a sandbox, in that new attack types are often tested and proven in the region
first. Therefore, it can be deemed vital for cyber threat intelligence analysts to monitor the
threat landscape in Ukraine to capture the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)
leveraged by Russian APTs before they are deployed elsewhere globally.
The adversaries targeting space organizations and satellite networks are some of the most
advanced in the wild. This includes highly well-resourced intelligence agencies operating on
behalf of Russia and China, as well as agencies from hostile states such as Iran and North
Korea. It is therefore important to recruit and cultivate skilled cybersecurity practitioners to
compete with the adversaries and direct investment into technologies to prevent
sophisticated attacks.

8/9

A lot of the focus has been on nation-state and cybercriminal threat groups, but more focus
should be on hacktivists groups that can also cause significant reputational damage to any
organization. Unlike nation-states that usually try to covertly gain and maintain access or
cybercriminals who look to monetise their access, hacktivists seek to embarrass an
organization by defacing websites, shutting down websites by DDoS attacks, or hack-andleak operations to spread unsavoury information publicly. State-backed threat actors have
also adopted hacktivists tactics due to the ability to generate headlines with the aim of
embarrassing their geopolitical opposition.
The threat model for the space industry is very different for many other verticals. The attack
surface involves a lot of advanced technology, such as SATCOM networks, that modern
vendors are not suited to protect and requires custom solutions. One main example of this is
that endpoint security for Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices is not currently anywhere near the
level that modern workstations have available. This makes this an area that is woefully
underprepared for nation-state advanced persistent threat groups that are going undetected
and waiting for the time to strike.
