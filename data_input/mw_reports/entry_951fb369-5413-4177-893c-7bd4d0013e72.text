Following the outbreak of the Petya-based malware in Ukraine, the author of the original
version, Janus, decided to release his master key, probably closing the project. You can read
the full story here.
Based on the released key, we prepared a decryptor that is capable of unlocking all the
legitimate versions of Petya (read more about identifying Petyas):
Red Petya
Green Petya (both versions) + Mischa
Goldeneye (bootlocker + files)

üòâ

In case if you have a backup of Petya-encrypted disk, this is the time to take it out from the
shelf and kiss your Petya goodbye
WARNING: During our tests we found that in some cases Petya may hang during decryption,
or cause some other problems potentially damaging to your data. That‚Äôs why, before any
decryption attempts, we recommend you to make an additional backup.

Variants of the attack
As we know, depending on version Petya may attack your data by two ways:
1 ‚Äì at a low level, encrypting your Master File Table. For example:

2 ‚Äì at a high level, encrypting your files one by one (like a typical ransomware). For
example:

Fortunately, the released key allows for recovery in both cases. However the process of
decryption will look a bit different.

Decryptors
We prepared two different builds of the recovery tool, to support the specific needs:
1. a Live CD
2. a Windows executable
In both cases, the tool decrypts the individual key from the victim ID.

After obtaining the key, you can use the original decryptors in order to recover your files. You
can find the links here:
For Mischa: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bzb5kQFOXkiSWUZ6dndxZkN1YlE
For Goldeneye: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bzb5kQFOXkiSdTZkUUYxZ0xEeDg
DISCLAIMER: Those tools are provided as is and you are using them at your own risk.

Defeating the bootlocker
In both cases, you can obtain the key to your Petya by using a Windows Executable and
supplying it your victim ID. Detailed instructions has been given here and on the video below:

However, victim IDs are very long, and retyping them may be painful and prone to mistakes.
That‚Äôs why, we prepared an alternative: a LiveCD that will automatically read it from the
encrypted disk. In order to use it, you need to download the ISO and boot from it your
infected machine. Then, follow the displayed instructions:

Decrypting files
In case if your files has been encrypted, i.e. by Goldeneye or Mischa, you can use the key
decryptor released in form of a Windows executable.

1. Find your victim ID (‚Äúpersonal decryption code‚Äù). It will be in your ransom note:

In case if you don‚Äôt have the note, you can find the ID appended at the end of any of your
encrypted files:

2. Save the ID in a file:

3. Use our tool to decrypt your key:

3. Copy the obtained key. Download the original decryptor, appropriate for your version:
For Mischa: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bzb5kQFOXkiSWUZ6dndxZkN1YlE
For Goldeneye: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bzb5kQFOXkiSdTZkUUYxZ0xEeDg
Choose one of your encrypted files:

Supply the key obtained from the key decoder:

Decrypt the file and check if the output is valid. If everything is fine, you can use the same
key to decrypt rest of your files. Supply the extension to the decryptor, and it will find them
automatically:

Conclusion
7/8

The presented tools allow you to unlock all the legitimate versions of Petya that are released
up to now by Janus Cybercrime Solutions. It cannot help the victims of pirated Petyas, like
PetrWrap or EternalPetya (aka NotPetya). It matches the announcement made by Janus on
twitter:

Is it the end of Petya‚Äôs story? Probably yes, however, the future will learn.
