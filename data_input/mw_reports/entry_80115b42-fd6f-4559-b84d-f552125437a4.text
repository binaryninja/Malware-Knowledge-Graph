Try not to stare - MedusaLocker at a glance

Tue 05 November 2019 in Ransomware
Mystic but also a new(-ish) threat: Medusa ransomware. Let's take a quick peek, but don't look too close or
you may need to fetch backups soon.

A general disclaimer as always: downloading and running the samples linked below will lead to the
encryption of your personal data, so be f$cking careful. Also check with your local laws as owning
malware binaries/ sources might be illegal depending on where you live.
medusa.exe @ AnyRun --> sha256

Taking a look at the stringdump that stringsifter produced one of the first things that stood out was this
base64 encoded image:

1/18

After decoding it we get an image of a medieval pest doctor. Fun fact: They wore these masks because
they thought it would protect them from the black death. One day someone will probably start selling these
for endpoint protection.

Another interesting extracted string is this PDB-Path:
C:\Users\Gh0St\Desktop\MedusaLockerInfo\MedusaLockerProject\MedusaLocker\Release\MedusaLocker.pdb
Running it through Detect it easy returns that MedusaLocker was built with Visual C++ and a (in malwareterms) relatively new Linker Version.

Entropy-wise it doesn't look like this sample is packed and the sections found don't look out of the ordinary
either.

2/18

After digging around in Ghidra for a bit I found FUN_00405bc0 which seems to be the main program
routine of MedusaLocker. The strings shown here match the output in the debug console present in the
second sample discussed below.

Yet another mysterious CLSID that I can't make sense of at the moment: {8761ABBD-7F85-42EE-B272A76179687C63}. Search results referencing it are around since October 21st and might make tracking
Medusa a bit easier.

3/18

Next up the Locker will "initialize the crypto module" which uses CryptGenKey provided by WinCrypt to
derive a keypair. I'll have a closer look at the encryption routine later.

It will skip files with the following suffixes:
exe, dll, sys, ini, lnk, rdp, encrypted

As it is very popular with Ransomware to disable the Automatic Startup Repair and delete System Restore
Points plus shadow copies Medusa will do so as well. After that it will also relanch LanmanWorkstation to
ensure that mapped network drives are available.

4/18

After the "Adding to Autoload" debug message it will rename itself to svchost.exe and add it's Registry Key
to the System startup.

5/18

MedusaLocker will try to terminate the following processes by their name. The List contains Security
Software as well as Services commonly used in productive environments such as SQL or Webservers.
wrapper, DefWatch, ccEvtMgr, ccSetMgr, SavRoam, sqlservr, sqlagent, sqladhlp, Culserver, RTVscan,
sqlbrowser, SQLADHLP,
QBIDPService, Intuit.QuickBooks.FCS, QBCFMonitorService, sqlwriter, msmdsrv, tomcat6,
zhudongfangyu, SQLADHLP,
vmware-usbarbitator64, vmware-converter, dbsrv12, dbeng8wxServer.exe, wxServerView, sqlservr.exe,
sqlmangr.exe,
RAgui.exe, supervise.exe, Culture.exe, RTVscan.exe, Defwatch.exe, sqlbrowser.exe, winword.exe,
QBW32.exe, QBDBMgr.exe,
qbupdate.exe, QBCFMonitorService.exe, axlbridge.exe, QBIDPService.exe, httpd.exe, fdlauncher.exe,
MsDtSrvr.exe,
tomcat6.exe, java.exe, 360se.exe, 360doctor.exe, wdswfsafe.exe, fdlauncher.exe, fdhost.exe,
GDscan.exe, ZhuDongFangYu.exe

It also copies itself to %APPDATA% after renaming to executable to "svchostt.exe".

To check if an instance of MedusaLocker previously ran on the system it will create a Registry Key at
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Medusa

Furthermore it tries to read the State of EnableLinkedConnections via
RegOpenKeyExW(HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE,
L"SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System" ... and enables the key if
necessary since Medusa tries to encrypt Shared Network Drives and removeable Media as well.

6/18

After terminating the encryption loop the Ransomware will wait for 60 seconds and start a new scan to
check for new unencrypted files.

Running MedusaLocker in a VM yields us this UAC Prompt with a mysterious CLSID ({3E5FC7F9-9A514367-9063-A120244FBEC7}). A quick google search brings us to Wikileaks Page for the CIA Vault7 leaks
and the ID seems to be corresponding to cmstplua.dll. Turns out this is an UAC bypass known and
implemented since August 2017 (mentioned here).

The Ransomnote (which is dropped in every directory that contains files to encrypt) is delivered as a HTML
file. In this early sample they seem to have messed up their text alignment. This was fixed in a later version
(see below) and will make it easier to identify new samples as they may appear.

7/18

Looking at the section list compared to the

8/18

This sample seems to have an enabled debug console which allows us to trace the steps of the infection.

Below you can see the new ransomnote. The Protonmail E-Mail address was exchanged for a cock.li one
and the Victim ID blob was fitted to the textbox.

9/18

BleepingComputer Forum User ttrifonov who was hit by the ransomware as well found suspicious files on
his Desktop after the Infection took place. Fortunately for us Medusa skipped the executables.

10/18

This would be a huge discovery infection vector-wise as this looks like the attacker gained access to the
machine via RDP. (Yet another proof [if we would need any] that RDP exposed to the internet isn't a good
idea)

Looks like the attacker left a few files related to Mimikatz as well...

As I mentioned earlier the keypair is generated via CryptGenKey. I'm still trying to map out all the actions on
the key material.

11/18

The encryption itself is done via the CryptEncrypt function. It seems to use AES for the files and then
encrypts the key with a RSA-2048 public key that is stored via a keyblob in the executable.

12/18

13/18

After the encryption routine is done the generated hKey is deleted via CryptDestroyKey.

Update 23.11.2019:
Now I want to take a closer look at the files left by the attacker on the Victim's Desktop as it was reported
multiple times on the BleepingComputer Forum. Besides the Mimikatz files in the kamikadze directory there
is a semi-legit tool called "Advanced Port Scanner" (AnyRun, which is basically just a garbage Zenmap
alternative for Windows people) and another one called "NetworkShare.exe" (AnyRun, seems to scan for
reachable network shares and tries to mount them).

It also looks like there's a dedicated version of MedusaLocker for Windows XP called dix_16_xp.exe. As
you can see below the Debug Messages start with [LockerXP] instead of [Locker].

The Decryptor

🧐

The Decryptor is delivered per Machine with a 4 letter filename indicating to which victim ID it belongs.
