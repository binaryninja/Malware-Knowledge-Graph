Last week, Unit 42 released a blog on a newly named threat group called DarkHydrus that
we observed targeting government entities in the Middle East. The attack that we discussed
in our previous publication involved spear-phishing to deliver a PowerShell payload we call
RogueRobin; however, we are aware of DarkHydrus carrying out a credential harvesting
attack in June 2018. It also appears that this an ongoing campaign, as we have evidence of
previous credential harvesting attempts using the same infrastructure dating back to the Fall
of 2017. These attacks were targeting government entities and educational institutions in the
Middle East.
The credential harvesting attacks used spear-phishing emails that contained malicious
Microsoft Office documents that leveraged the “attachedTemplate” technique to load a
template from a remote server. When attempting to load this remote template, Microsoft
Office will display an authentication dialog box to ask the user to provide login credentials.

When entered, these credentials are then sent to the C2 server, which allows DarkHydrus to
collect the user account credentials.
Based on Unit 42’s analysis, DarkHydrus used the open-source Phishery tool to create two
of the known Word documents used in these credential harvesting attacks. As discussed in
our previous blog, this further strengthens DarkHydrus’ use of the open source for their
attack tools.
A phishing attack to steal credentials like this is not new: US-CERT warned of the same
technique by a different threat group in 2017. What is noteworthy is DarkHydrus’ use of an
open-source tool to carry out targeted attacks against these entities in the Middle East, which
is fitting of their reliance of open source tools and these attacks are consistent in terms of
targeting with what we reported last week. Based on this, we can reasonably presume this
group will continue to carry out attacks against these kinds of targets in the Middle East in
the near-future.
Credential Harvesting Attack
On June 24, 2018, Unit 42 observed DarkHydrus carrying out a credential harvesting attack
on an educational institution in the Middle East. The attack involved a spear-phishing email
with a subject of “Project Offer” and a malicious Word document (SHA256:
d393349a4ad00902e3d415b622cf27987a0170a786ca3a1f991a521bff645318) as an
attachment. When opened, the malicious Word document displays a dialog box that asks the
user for their credentials, as seen in Figure 1.

As you can see in Figure 1, the authentication prompt says “Connecting to <redacted>.
0utl00k[.]net”, which is a DarkHydrus C2 server. If the user enters their credentials in this
dialog box and presses ‘Ok’, the credentials are sent to the C2 server via the URL
https://<redacted>.0utl00k[.]net/download/template.docx. With the authentication dialog box
gone, Word displays the contents of the document, which in this specific case was an empty
document. While this document was empty, the authentication prompt may have made the
targeted user more likely to enter their credentials, thinking it’s necessary to view the
contents of the document.
DarkHydrus also created their C2 domain carefully in an attempt to further trick the targeted
user to enter their credentials. Firstly, the redacted subdomain was the domain of the
targeted educational institution. Also, the 0utl00k[.]net domain resembles Microsoft’s
legitimate "outlook.com” domain that provides free email services, which also make the user
less suspicious and more likely to enter their credentials. Some users may not even notice
what domain the dialog states they are connecting to and habitually type their Windows
credentials.
We found two additional Word documents using the 0utl00k[.]net domain to harvest
credentials, seen in Table 1. We first saw these related Word documents in September and
November 2017, which suggests that DarkHydrus has been carrying out this credential
harvesting campaign for almost a year.

Table 1. Additional DarkHydrus Word documents used to steal credentials
Both of these related documents use the attachedTemplate technique to steal credentials by
sending them to a URL https://0utl00k[.]net/docs. Unlike the June 2018 document that
displayed no content after credential theft, both of these documents displayed content that
appears pertinent to the targeted organization. The September 2017 document displays an
employee survey, which can be seen in Figure 2.

The November 2017 document displays a password handover document after credential
theft occurs, as seen in Figure 3. We were unable to find the displayed document via open
source research, which may suggest that the actor gathered this password handover form
from a prior operation.

The infrastructure used in these credential harvesting attacks used the domain 0utl00k[.]net,
which at the time of the attacks resolved to 107.175.150[.]113 and 195.154.41[.]150. This
same infrastructure was discussed in the Campaign Analysis of our previous blog.
Phishery Tool
While analyzing the three malicious Word documents, we determined that two of the
documents were created using an open source tool called Phishery. The Phishery tool is
capable of the following:
1. Creating malicious Word documents by injecting a remote template URL
2. Hosting a C2 server to gather credentials entered into authentication dialog boxes
displayed when attempting to obtain the remote template
We were able to confirm that DarkHydrus used Phishery to create these Word documents by
using the open source tool to create a document and host a C2 ourselves. The DarkHydrus
document used in the June 2018 attacks had a remote template URL added, as seen in

Figure 4.

We were able to replicate the remote template path seen in Figure 4 by using Phishery to
create a weaponized delivery document. Figure 5 shows Phishery’s output to the command
that injects a URL into a file named “good_test.docx”, which it will save the resulting file to
“bad_test.docx”.

URL as DarkHydrus

To confirm, we used Phishery’s C2 server and opened DarkHydrus’ Word document from the
June 2018 attacks. When presented with the authentication dialog box, we entered
“fakename” and “fakepass” as credentials, as seen in Figure 6 and pressed enter.

On the C2 server, we observed Phishery receiving the inbound request and capturing the
credentials, as seen in Figure 7. The C2 server was able to obtain the “fakename” and
“fakepass” credentials entered into the authentication dialog box displayed when opening
DarkHydrus’ Word document.

Conclusion
DarkHydrus is a threat group carrying out attack campaigns targeting organizations in the
Middle East. We discovered DarkHydrus carrying out credential harvesting attacks that use
weaponized Word documents, which they delivered via spear-phishing emails to entities
within government and educational institutions. This threat group not only used the Phishery
tool to create these malicious Word documents, but also to host the C2 server to harvest

credentials. The use of Phishery further shows Dark Hydrus’ reliance on open source tools to
conduct their operations.
