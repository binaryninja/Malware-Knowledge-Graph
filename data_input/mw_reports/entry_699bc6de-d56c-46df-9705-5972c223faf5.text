Key Takeaways
TA444 is a North Korea state-sponsored threat actor that tested numerous infection
methods in 2022 with varying degrees of success.
TA444 is a unicorn among state-aligned actors as its primary operations are financially
motivated, and their infection chains are often a microcosm of the cybercrime threat
landscape at large.
While TA444 has been active in its current form of targeting cryptocurrencies since at
least 2017, the group has adopted an upstart mentality during the latter stages of
2022.

Overview
In the world of tech startups, luminaries and charlatans alike boast of the value of rapid
iteration, testing products on the fly, and failing forward. TA444, a North Korea-sponsored
advanced persistent threat group, has taken these mantras to heart. TA444, which overlaps
with public activity called APT38, Bluenoroff, BlackAlicanto, Stardust Chollima,
and COPERNICIUM, is likely tasked with generating revenue for the North Korean regime.
That tasking has historically involved the targeting of banks to ultimately funnel cash to the
Hermit Kingdom or handlers abroad. More recently, TA444 has turned its attention, much like
the tech industry, to cryptocurrency. While we do not know if the group has ping pong tables
or kegs of some overrated IPA in its workspace, TA444 does mirror the startup culture in its
devotion to the dollar and to the grind.

Fail Fast with File Type Variations
Back in its infant interest with blockchain and cryptocurrency, TA444 had two main avenues
of initial access: an LNK-oriented delivery chain and a chain beginning with documents using
remote templates. These campaigns were typically referred to
3/12

as DangerousPassword, CryptoCore, or SnatchCrypto. In 2022, TA444 continued to use
both methods, but had also tried its hand at other file types for initial access. Despite having
not heavily relied on macros in previous campaigns, TA444 seemed to mirror the cybercrime
landscape in the summer and fall, attempting to find additional file types to stuff its payloads
into.
It is unclear if the threat actor had a hackathon to generate these ideas, but we believe some
of the (dramatized) conversations may have sounded like this:
MSI Installer files? Let’s give it a shot but try a few varieties and see what sticks!
Virtual Hard Drive? TA580 used it to drop Bumblebee, why don’t we have a VHD
chain?
ISOs to bypass MoTW? If the market wants it, let’s give it to them!
Compiled HTML? What are we, TA406? Eh, give it a try anyway!
We can experiment all we want but we must keep up with our CageyChameleon and
Astraeus quotas to meet our OKRs!
Equally as surprising as the variance in delivery methods is the lack of a consistent payload
at the end of the delivery chains. When other financially-oriented threat actors test delivery
methods, they tend to load their traditional payloads; this is not the case with TA444. This
suggests that there is an embedded, or at least a devoted, malware development element
alongside TA444 operators.

What’s Our Go-to-Market?
To convince victims to click on malicious links, TA444 has a complete marketing strategy to
increase its chances of new ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue). It all starts with crafting lure
content that may be of interest or necessity to the target. These can include analyses of
cryptocurrency blockchains, job opportunities at prestigious firms, or salary adjustments.

TA444 has abused email marketing tools like SendInBlue and SendGrid to engage with its
target audience. These serve as redirectors to either cloud-hosted files or connect the victim
directly to TA444 infrastructure. Additionally, the use of such links removes some stigma from
the user of clicking on an unknown link, as marketing links will not necessarily get called out
by phishing training.
Like other entities in the tech and cryptocurrency space, someone in TA444’s organization
oversees socials. This is a very strong component of TA444’s practice, as the threat actor
has continued to use LinkedIn to engage with victims prior to delivering links to malware.
Proofpoint has observed this group demonstrating workable understandings of English,
Spanish, Polish, and Japanese.

Test in Prod

In early December 2022, Proofpoint researchers observed a significant deviation from
normal TA444 operations via a relatively basic credential harvesting campaign. A TA444 C2
domain sent OneDrive phishing emails rife with typos to a wide variety of targets in the
United States and Canada, spanning several verticals including education, government, and
healthcare, in addition to financial verticals. The lure emails enticed users to click a SendGrid
URL which redirected to a credential harvesting page. The deviation in TA444’s targeting and
volume of messages made us thoroughly analyze the campaign to both understand the
activity, but also challenged our assumptions about the group. This spam wave alone nearly
doubled the total volume of TA444 email messages we had observed in our data during
2022, so we were concerned about false positive detection, as well as understanding a
potential change in TA444 objectives.
The from header used the term Admin and the target domain name, but all used the same
envelope-from email address (admin[@]sharedrive[.]ink) and subject (Invoice spelled with a
lowercase L).

Figure 2. TA444 phishing email that deviated from expected themes and targeting.
The SendGrid URLs are used to redirect targets to the domain superiorexhbits[.]com which
uses common phishing tactics such as loading the victim's iconography via the logorendering service ClearBit. This sprawling credential harvesting activity is a deviation from
normal TA444 campaigns, which typically involve the direct deployment of malware. In fact,
this same domain was observed serving a TA444 VHD containing Cur1Agent on the same
day.
Proofpoint attributed this campaign with moderate to moderately high confidence based on
the exclusivity of TA444 infrastructure. Other domains hosted on that IP match previous
TA444 typo squats. The emails also had valid DMARC and SPF records, indicating that the
sender has control of that domain. Proofpoint cannot rule out that the TA444 server was
6/12

compromised by another actor to send the phishing links. It is also possible that TA444, like
other North Korean actors such as Andariel, has begun its own moonlighting operations. If
this occurred, we would anticipate seeing tool and infrastructure re-use as well as continued
deviation of targeting away from major cryptocurrency and financial institutions.

The Culture is the Foundation
While TA444 has experimented with new lines of production, their core families still carry the
brunt of their infections. The CageyChameleon (aka CabbageRAT) family has expanded its
functionality but still operates as a victim-profiling framework, exfiltrating running processes
and host information while setting up the potential to launch subsequent tooling loaded from
the command-and-control server. The lure LNKs used to initiate execution are still often titled
Password.txt.lnk.

Similarly, TA444 has stayed the course with its infrastructure deployments and document
content, effectively reusing lure iconography in second-stage macro-laden files
and borrowing content directly from entities it is spoofing. First stage remote template files
have adapted to not only download the second-stage macro (tracked as Astraeus by
Proofpoint) but the first stage now contains an obfuscated Cardinal backdoor, as noted
by PWC and Kaspersky.

Security researchers have observed TA444 deploying an impressive set of post-exploitation
backdoors in its history, including msoRAT, Cardinal (default.rdp), the Rantankba
suite, CHEESETRAY, and DYEPACK, as well as passive backdoors, virtualized listeners,
and browser extensions to facilitate theft.

Attribution
Proofpoint clusters TA444 activities based on malware lineage, behavioral heuristics and
traits of first-stage tooling meant to fool targeted users, distinctive infrastructure usage,
and targeting of financial entities, along with other factors. Historic TA444 operations, such
as the 2016 Bangladesh Bank heist and targeting of cryptocurrency entities, have
been linked to the North Korean government by the United States.
The United States Treasury Department levied sanctions against two coin mixing services,
Tornado Cash and BlenderIO, for allowing TA444 operators to launder over $120 million of
cryptocurrency stolen from intrusions into various bridge and exchange entities. The US
Federal Bureau of Investigation attributed the heist of a major cryptocurrency bridge to
APT38, a group which heavily overlaps with TA444, where funds were later mixed in
BlenderIO. This attribution underlines how reliant TA444 is on the cryptocurrency ecosystem
to steal funds, create an avenue to launder them, and cash out. Recent TA444 activity
highlights how willing the adversary is to adapt their methods to continue to profit from its
intrusions, and new services will like aide them in their efforts, even if unintentionally.

Conclusion
While we may poke fun at its broad campaigns and ease of clustering, TA444 is an astute
and capable adversary that is willing and able to defraud victims for hundreds of millions of
dollars. TA444 and related clusters are assessed to have stolen nearly $400 million dollars’
worth of cryptocurrency and related assets in 2021. In 2022, the group surpassed that value
8/12

in a single heist worth over $500 million, gathering more than $1 billion during 2022. North
Korea, like other cryptocurrency enthusiasts, has weathered the declining value of
cryptocurrencies, but remains engaged in its efforts to use cryptocurrency as a vehicle to
provide usable funds to the regime.
