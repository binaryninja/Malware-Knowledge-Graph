Iranian threat agent OilRig has been targeting multiple organisations in Israel and other countries in the

Shipping Companies

Middle East since the end of 2015. In recent attacks they set up a fake VPN Web Portal and targeted at

Magecart – a malicious infrastructure for stealing

least ve Israeli IT vendors, several nancial institutes, and the Israeli Post Of ce.

payment details from online shops

Later, the attackers set up two fake websites pretending to be a University of Oxford conference sign-up

Operation DustySky - Part 2

page and a job application website. In these websites they hosted malware that was digitally
signed with a valid, likely stolen code signing certi cate
Based on VirusTotal uploads, malicious documents content, and known victims – other targeted
organisations are located in Turkey, Qatar, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Lebanon.

Fake VPN Web Portal
In one of the recent cases, the attackers sent the following email to individuals in targeted
organisations:

The email was sent from a compromised account of an IT vendor. Similar emails were sent from other
IT vendors in the same time period, suggesting the attackers had a foothold within their networks, or at
least could get access to speci c computers or email accounts.
The link provided in the malicious email led to a fake VPN Web Portal:

Upon logging in with the credentials provided in the email, the victim is presented with the following

The victim is asked to install the “VPN Client” (an .exe le), or, if download fails, to download a password
protected zip (with the same .exe le inside).
The “VPN Client” is a legitimate Juniper VPN software bundled with Helminth, a malware in use by the
OilRig threat agnet:
JuniperSetupClientInstaller.exe
6a65d762fb548d2dc56cfde4842a4d3c (VirusTotal link)
If the victim downloads and installs the le, their computer would get infected, while the legitimate VPN
software is installed. The legitimate and the malicious installations can be seen in the process tree
when the le is run in a Cuckoo sandbox. Malicious processes are marked red (click image to enlarge):

The following malicious les are dropped and run:
C:\ProgramData\{2ED05C38-D464-4188-BC7FF6915DE8D764}\OFFLINE\9A189DFE\C7B7C186\main.vbs

Command and control server is located in the following domain:
tecsupport[.]in
A detailed analysis of the malware is provided in two posts by Palo Alto networks and in a post by
FireEye, which wrote about previous campaigns by this threat agent.
(Note that Juniper networks was not compromised nor otherwise involved in the attack, except for the
attackers using its name and publicly available software).

Digitally signed malware
The entire bundle (VPN client and malware) was digitally signed with a valid code signing certi cate
issued by Symantec to AI Squared, a legitimate software company that develops accessibility software:

Thumbprint: F340C0D841F9D99DBC289151C13391000366631C
Serial number: 45 E4 7F 56 0B 01 B6 4E 68 39 5E 5D 79 2F 2E 09

Another Helminth sample, 1c23b3f11f933d98febfd5a92eb5c715, was signed with a different AI
Squared code signing certi cate:
Thumbprint: 92B8C0872BACDC226B9CE4D783D5CCAD61C6158A
Serial number:62 E0 44 E7 37 24 61 2D 79 4B 93 AF 97 46 13 48
This suggest that the attackers had got a hold of an AI Squared signing key, potentially after
compromising their network. Alternatively, the attackers might have got Symantec to issue them a
certi cate under AI Squared’s name.

University of Oxford impersonation
The attackers registered four domains impersonating The University of Oxford.
oxford-symposia[.]com, is a fake Oxford conference registration website. Visitors are asked to
download the “University Of Oxford Job Symposium Pre-Register Tool”:

The downloaded le (which is also signed with an AI Squared certi cate), is a fake registration tool built
by the attackers:
OxfordSymposiumRegTool.exe
f77ee804de304f7c3ea6b87824684b33
If run by the victim, their computer would get infected, while they are shown this registration process:

Note that after completing the “registration process”, the victim is asked to send the form to an email
address in oxford-careers[.]com, which also belongs to the attackers.
Previously the fake website linked to the following documents in a third fake Oxford domain, oxford[.]in:
http://oxford[.]in/downloads/ls1.doc
http://oxford[.]in/downloads/ls2.doc
http://oxford[.]in/downloads/ls3.doc
http://oxford[.]in/downloads/ls4.do
The documents were unavailable during our research, and their content is unknown to us.
The attackers used a forth domain, oxford-employee[.]com, to host an “Oxford Job application” website:

Visitors are asked to “Download CV Creator” in order “To Join University of Oxford staff”. CV Creator is a
malicious le hosted at http://www.oxford-careers[.]com/Files/OxfordCVCreator.exe :

OxfordCVCreator.exe
5713c3c01067c91771ac70e193ef5419
When run, the victim is again presented with a tool created by the attackers, this time a “University Of
Oxford Of cial CV Creator”:

Both samples mentioned in this section had the following domain used for command and control:
updater[.]li

Other incidents
In an earlier incident, the attackers sent a malicious excel le impersonating Israir, an Israeli Airline (the
content of the le was copied from the company’s public website and we have no indication of it
being compromised or targeted):
Israel Airline.xls
197c018922237828683783654d3c632a

The le had a macro that if enabled by the user would infect its computer.
In other incidents the attackers used the following les:
Special Offers.xls / Salary Employee 2016.xls

Infrastructure overlap with Cadelle and Chafer
In December 2015, Symantec published a post about “two Iran-based attack groups that appear to be
connected, Cadelle and Chafer” that “have been using Backdoor.Cadelspy and Backdoor.Remexi to spy
on Iranian individuals and Middle Eastern organizations”.
Backdoor.Remexi, one of the malware in use by Chafer, had the following command and control host:
87pqxz159.dockerjsbin[.]com
Interestingly, IP address 83.142.230.138, which serve as a command and control address for an OilRig
related sample (3a5fcba80c1fd685c4b5085d9d474118), was pointed to
by 87pqxz159.dockerjsbin[.]com as well.
This suggest that the two groups may actually be the same entity, or that they share resources in one
why or another.
