Hackers are targeting Ukrainian government agencies with new attacks exploiting Zimbra
exploits and phishing attacks pushing the IcedID malware.
The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) detected the new
campaigns and attributed the IcedID phishing attack to the UAC-0041 threat cluster,
previously connected with AgentTesla distribution, and the second to UAC-0097, a currently
unknown actor.
Although attributions are moderately confident, this is another snapshot of the malicious
cyber-activity targeting Ukrainian entities.
In both cases, the goal of the threat actors is to gain access to internal networks to perform
cyber-espionage on Ukraine's most critical government agencies.

IcedID infecting state orgs
The first report describes a campaign distributing XLS documents named "Mobilization
Register.xls," reaching many recipients.
Opening the document requests the user to "Enable the Content" for viewing, resulting in a
malicious macro executing to download and run a malicious file.
This file is the GzipLoader malware, which fetches, decrypts, and executes the final payload,
IcedID (aka BankBot).
IcedID is a modular banking trojan that can be used for stealing account credentials or as a
loader of additional, second-stage malware such as Cobalt Strike, ransomware, wipers, and
more.

Spying on government emails
The second report involves an email sent to government agencies in Ukraine, with attached
images allegedly from an event where President V. Zelensky awarded Armed Forces
members.

Email with malicious jpg attachments (CERT-UA)
The attached images contain a content-location header that links to a web resource hosting
JavaScript code that triggers the exploitation of the Zimbra CVE-2018-6882 vulnerability.
This cross-site scripting vulnerability affects Zimbra Collaboration Suite versions 8.7 and
older, enabling remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a content-location
header in email attachments.
Zimbra is an email and collaboration platform that also includes instant messaging, contacts,
video conferencing, file sharing, and cloud storage capabilities.
In this case, exploiting the flaw adds a forwarding rule for the victim's emails to a new
address under the threat actor's control, which is clearly an espionage-supporting move.

Setting Zimbra to forward victim's emails (CERT-UA)
It is worth noting that Zimbra had a similar XSS problem earlier this year, affecting the most
recent 8.8.15 P29 & P30 versions of the suite.
That flaw was actively exploited as a zero-day by Chinese threat actors who used it to steal
the emails of European media and government organizations.
As such, CERT-UA advises all organizations in Ukraine using Zimbra to update to the latest
available versions of the suite immediately.
