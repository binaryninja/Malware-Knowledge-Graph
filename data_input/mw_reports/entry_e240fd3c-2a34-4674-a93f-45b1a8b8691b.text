There are many things that can be logged on a computer. While not all logging data is useful
for the average user, a lot of logging goes on in the background of any system. However:
There is good logging and bad logging. We have looked at an example of logging you
definitely would not want.
Over the last weeks we observed a malware variant named MassLogger which is sold on
hacker forums and advertised via Youtube videos. It is a .NET malware classified as a
credential stealer and spyware, being weaponized with a variety of routines to steal sensitive
data from users, as well as spy on them.
The use cases for MassLogger vary a lot. However, we observed reports from
other researchers and are confident that MassLogger is mostly distributed by phishing mails.

Modularity

2/8

MassLogger is developed to be sold to a wide variety of criminals, therefore it is also highly
modular. During our analysis, we found flags for various kinds of modules this malware has
to offer. These modules are also introduced by the author. We are confident that customers
are able to enable or disable certain features once a purchase is made.
Masslogger is usually packed with various packers which implement additional techniques to
evade environments used to analyse malicious binaries. The sample we investigated was
packed with at least the CyaX .NET Packer or reuses its code. One more packing stage was
added which was able to detect whether the dnSpy debugger is attached to it.

Credential Logging
As the trend to execute malicious code in memory continues, MassLogger also makes use of
this. The sample we investigated starts itself in a new process, allocates executable memory
and injects the mentioned routine into the newly created process via Process Injection. The
new process starts to iterate over files holding login credentials and writes them into a new
file.

Iteration through files holding sensitive information
The sample writes credentials, as well as its configuration into a separate log file. It also has
the capability to take screenshots.

about victim's system and MassLogger's configuration
The C2 carrier protocol depends on the sample's configuration, the variant we investigated
tried to send the results over SMTP to the c2 server. We also identified that MassLogger can
atleast be configured to transfer the logging results via FTP to its control server.

Preventing MassLogger infection and outlook
During the creation of this article, we continued to watch MassLogger and its distribution. We
believe that MassLogger will spread and stay alive for at least the next months. So it is
recommened to keep an eye on suspicious mails, because malicious email attachments are
still the most popular way to distribute malware. Furthermore we suggest to stay updated on
the current threat landscape and read cyber security news in order to proactively defend
yourself against cyber security threats.
