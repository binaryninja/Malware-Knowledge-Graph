What is NullMixer?

NullMixer is a dropper currently being used to drop multiple malware families. According to
Kaspersky, NullMixer is spread via malicious websites related to cracks, keygens, and
activators used for software piracy. Most NullMixer activity was observed targeting users in
the US, Brazil, India, Russia, Italy, Germany, France, Egypt, and Turkey.

The threat actors behind NullMixer employ sophisticated SEO to stay near the top of search
results. When unwitting victims attempt to download software from the sites, they experience
multiple redirects, eventually landing on a page containing an archived password-protected
file. While the victims think they are downloading the desired software, the archive actually
contains NullMixer.

NullMixer drops the following malware families:

SmokeLoader is a modular malware primarily used to download and execute other payloads.

also upload and download files, execute commands, and send information about the infected
computer to the C2.

PseudoManuscrypt
PseudoManuscrypt is a MaaS (malware as a service) used to steal cookies from multiple
applications, including Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Opera, and Yandex. The malware also allows
keylogging and cryptocurrency theft using ClipBanker. PseudoManuscrypt uses the KCP
