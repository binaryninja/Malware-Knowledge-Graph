Summary
tl;dr
This post explores some of the TTPs employed by a threat actor who were observed
deploying LockBit 3.0 ransomware during an incident response engagement.
Below provides a summary of findings which are presented in this blog post:
Initial access via SocGholish.
Establishing persistence to run Cobalt Strike beacon.
Disabling of Windows Defender and Sophos.
Use of information gathering tools such as Bloodhound and Seatbelt.
Lateral movement leveraging RDP and Cobalt Strike.
Use of 7zip to collect data for exfiltration.
Cobalt Strike use for Command and Control.
Exfiltration of data to Mega.
Use of PsExec to push out ransomware.

LockBit 3.0
LockBit 3.0 aka “LockBit Black”, noted in June of this year has coincided with a large
increase of victims being published to the LockBit leak site, indicating that the past few
months has heralded a period of intense activity for the LockBit collective.

In the wake of the apparent implosion of previous prolific ransomware group CONTI [1], it
seems that the LockBit operators are looking to fill the void; presenting a continued risk of
encryption and data exfiltration to organizations around the world.

TTPs
Initial Access
Initial access into the network was gained via a download of a malware-laced zip file
containing SocGholish. Once executed, the download of a Cobalt Strike beacon was initiated
which was created in the folder C:\ProgramData\VGAuthService with the filename
VGAuthService.dll . Along with this, the Windows command-line utility rundll32.exe is
copied to the folder and renamed to VGAuthService.exe and used to execute the Cobalt
Strike DLL.
PowerShell commands were also executed by the SocGholish malware to gather system
and domain information:
powershell /c nltest /dclist: ; nltest /domain_trusts ; cmdkey /list ;
net group 'Domain Admins' /domain ; net group 'Enterprise Admins'
/domain ; net localgroup Administrators /domain ; net localgroup
Administrators ;
powershell /c Get-WmiObject win32_service -ComputerName localhost |
Where-Object {$_.PathName -notmatch 'c:\\win'} | select Name,
DisplayName, State, PathName | findstr 'Running'

Persistence
A persistence mechanism was installed by SocGholish using the startup folder of the
infected user to ensure execution at user logon. The shortcut file C:\Users\
<user>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start

was created and configured to execute the
following command which will run the Cobalt Strike beacon deployed to the host:
Menu\Programs\Startup\VGAuthService.lnk

C:\ProgramData\VGAuthService\VGAuthService.exe
C:\ProgramData\VGAuthService\VGAuthService.dll,DllRegisterServer

Defence Evasion
Deployment of a batch script named 123.bat was observed on multiple hosts and was
deployed via PsExec. The script possessed the capabilities to uninstall Sophos, disable
Windows Defender and terminate running services where the service name contained
specific strings. The contents of the batch script are provided below:

Figure1: 123.bat contents
The ransomware binary used also clears key Windows event log files including Application,
System and Security. It also prevents any further events from being written by targeting the
EventLog service.

Discovery
Bloodhound was executed days after the initial SocGholish infection on the patient zero host.
The output file was created in the C:\ProgramData\ directory and had the file extension
.bac instead of the usual .zip, however this file was still a zip archive.
A TGS ticket for a single account was observed on patient zero in a text file under
C:\ProgramData\ . It appears the threat actor was gathering TGS tickets for SPNs
associated with the compromised user.
Seatbelt [2] was also executed on the patient zero host alongside Bloodhound. Securityorientated information about the host gathered by Seatbelt was outputted to the file
C:\ProgramData\seat.txt .

Lateral Movement
The following methods were utilized to move laterally throughout the victim network:
Cobalt Strike remotely installed temporary services on targeted hosts which executed a
Cobalt Strike beacon. An example command line of what the services were configured
to run is provided below:
rundll32.exe c:\programdata\svchost1.dll,DllRegisterServer

RDP sessions were established using a high privileged account the threat actor had
compromised prior.

Collection

3/6

7zip was deployed by the adversary to compress and stage data from folders of interest
which had been browsed during RDP sessions.

Command and Control
Cobalt Strike was the primary C2 framework utilized by the threat actor to maintain their
presence on the estate as well as laterally move.

Exfiltration Using MegaSync
Before deploying the ransomware to the network, the threat actor began to exfiltrate data to
Mega, a cloud storage provider. This was achieved by downloading Mega sync software onto
compromised hosts, allowing for direct upload of data to Mega.

Impact
The ransomware was pushed out to the endpoints using PsExec and impacted both servers
and end-user devices. The ransomware executable was named zzz.exe and was located
in the following folders:
C:\Windows\
C:\ProgramData\
C:\Users\<user>\Desktop\

Recommendations
1. Ensure that both online and offline backups are taken and test the backup plan
regularly to identify any weak points that could be exploited by an adversary.
2. Restrict internal RDP and SMB traffic so that only hosts that are required to
communicate via these protocols are allowed to.
3. Monitor firewalls for anomalous spikes in data leaving the network.
4. Block traffic to cloud storage services such as Mega which have no legitimate use in a
corporate environment.
5. Provide regular security awareness training.
