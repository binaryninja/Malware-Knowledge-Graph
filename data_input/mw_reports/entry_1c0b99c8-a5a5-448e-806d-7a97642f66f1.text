Executive Summary
Users on the internet rely on domain names to find brands, services, professionals and
personal websites. Cybercriminals take advantage of the essential role that domain names
play on the internet by registering names that appear related to existing domains or brands,
with the intent of profiting from user mistakes. This is known as cybersquatting. The purpose
of squatting domains is to confuse users into believing that the targeted brands (such as
Netflix) own these domain names (such as netflix-payments[.]com) or to profit from users’

typing mistakes (such as whatsalpp[.]com for WhatsApp). While cybersquatting is not always
[1]
malicious toward users, it is illegal in the U.S., and squatting domains are often used or
repurposed for attacks.
The Palo Alto Networks squatting detector system discovered that 13,857 squatting domains
were registered in December 2019, an average of 450 per day. We found that 2,595
(18.59%) squatted domain names are malicious, often distributing malware or conducting
phishing attacks, and 5,104 (36.57%) squatting domains we studied present a high risk to
users visiting them, meaning they have evidence of association with malicious URLs within
the domain or are utilizing bulletproof hosting.
We also ranked the Top 20 most abused domains in December 2019 based on adjusted
malicious rate, which means that a domain is either a target of many squatting domains or
most of these squatting domains are confirmed malicious. We found that domain squatters
prefer profitable targets, such as mainstream search engines and social media, financial,
shopping and banking websites. When visiting these sites, users are often prepared to share
sensitive information, which opens them up to phishing and scams to steal sensitive
credentials or money if they can be deceived into visiting a squatting domain instead.

2/27

From December 2019 to date, we observed a variety of malicious domains with different
objectives:
Phishing: A domain mimicking Wells Fargo (secure-wellsfargo[.]org) targeting
customers to steal sensitive information, including email credentials and ATM PINs.
Also, a domain mimicking Amazon (amazon-india[.]online) set up to steal user
credentials, specifically targeting mobile users in India.
Malware distribution: A domain mimicking Samsung (samsungeblyaiphone[.]com)
hosting Azorult malware to steal credit card information.
Command and control (C2): Domains mimicking Microsoft (microsoft-store-drmserver[.]com and microsoft-sback-server[.]com) attempting to conduct C2 attacks to
compromise an entire network.
Re-bill scam: Several phishing sites mimicking Netflix (such as
netflixbrazilcovid[.]com) set up to steal victims’ money by first offering a small initial
payment for a subscription to a product like weight loss pills. However, if users don’t
cancel the subscription after the promotion period, a much higher cost will be charged
to their credit cards, usually $50-100.
Potentially unwanted program (PUP): Domains mimicking Walmart
(walrmart44[.]com) and Samsung (samsungpr0mo[.]online) distributing PUP, such as
spyware, adware or a browser extension. They usually perform unwanted changes, like
changing the browser's default page or hijacking the browser to insert ads. Of note, the
Samsung domain looks like a legitimate Australia educational news website.
Technical support scam: Domains mimicking Microsoft (such as microsoftalert[.]club) trying to scare users into paying for fake customer support.
Reward scam: A domain mimicking Facebook (facebookwinners2020[.]com)
scamming users with rewards, such as free products or money. To claim the prize,
users need to fill out a form with their personal information such as date of birth, phone
number, occupation and income.
Domain parking: A domain mimicking RBC Royal Bank (rbyroyalbank[.]com)
leveraging a popular parking service, ParkingCrew, to generate profit based on how
many users land on the site and click the advertisements.
We studied domain squatting techniques including typosquatting, combosquatting, levelsquatting, bitsquatting and homograph-squatting (all defined below). Malicious actors can
use these techniques to distribute malware or to conduct scams and phishing campaigns.
To detect squatting domains, Palo Alto Networks developed an automated system to capture
emerging campaigns from newly registered domains, as well as from passive DNS (pDNS)
data. We continue to detect currently active cybersquatting domains – we identify malicious
and suspicious squatting domains and designate them to the appropriate categories (such as
phishing, malware, C2 or grayware). Protections against domains classified in these
categories are available in multiple Palo Alto Networks security subscriptions, including URL
Filtering and DNS Security.

3/27

We recommend that enterprises block and closely monitor traffic from these domains, while
consumers should make sure that they type domain names correctly and double-check that
the domain owners are trusted before entering any site. More tips can be found in this post
on how to protect against cyberattacks.

Squatting Techniques
Typosquatting is one of the most common types of domain registration abuse.
Typosquatters intentionally register misspelled variants (such as whatsalpp[.]com) of target
domain names (whatsapp[.]com) to profit from users’ typing mistakes or to deceive users into
believing that they are visiting the correct target domain. The most frequent typosquatting
techniques include registering names one edit distance from the original domain, as these
are the most common and overlooked mistakes users make. For more information, readers
can refer to academic research papers on the scale and malicious use of typosquatting.
Combosquatting is another widespread registration abuse that combines popular
trademarks with words such as “security,” “payment” or “verification.” Combosquatting
domains like netflix-payments[.]com are often used in phishing emails, by scam websites
and for social engineering attacks to convince users that they are visiting web content
maintained by the targeted trademark. For more information, readers can refer to this
academic paper on a longitudinal study of combosquatting.
Homographsquatting domains take advantage of internationalized domain names (IDNs),
where Unicode characters are allowed (such as microsofŧ[.]com). Attackers usually replace
one or more characters in the target domain with visually similar characters from another
language. These domains can be perfectly indistinguishable from their targets, as in the case
of apple.com, where the English letter "a" (U+0061) was replaced with the Cyrillic letter "а"
(U+0430). For more information, readers can refer to academic research papers on IDNs.
Soundsquatting domains take advantage of homophones, i.e., words that sound alike (for
example, weather and whether). Attackers can register homophone variants of popular
domains, such as 4ever21[.]com for forever21[.]com. As text-to-speech software like Siri and
Google Assistant becomes prevalent, more and more users will become vulnerable to the
abuse of soundsquatting domains. For more information, readers can refer to this academic
research paper on soundsquatting.
Bitsquatting domains have a character that differs in one bit (such as micposoft[.]com) from
the same character as the targeted legitimate domain (microsoft[.]com). Bitsquatting can
benefit attackers because a hardware error can cause a random bit-flip in memory where
domain names are stored temporarily. Thus, even though users type the correct domains,
they may still be led to malicious ones. Although such hardware errors are usually rare, an
academic research paper has shown that bitsquatting is a real threat.

4/27

Levelsquatting domains, such as the case of
safety.microsoft.com.mdmfmztwjj.l6kan7uf04p102xmpq[.]bid, include the targeted brand’s
domain name as a subdomain. In this example, the victims of the phishing attack might
believe they are visiting safety.microsoft.com, when instead, they are visiting the attacker’s
website. This attack is especially worrisome for mobile users because the browser's address
bar might not be wide enough to display the entire domain name. For more information,
readers can refer to this academic paper for a more comprehensive study of levelsquatting
domains.

Detection of Various Squatting Techniques
We leverage lexical analysis to detect candidate squatting domains among the Palo Alto
Networks newly registered domain (NRD) and pDNS feeds. Our list of target domains is the
combination of popular domains in general and domains popular in specific categories, such
as shopping and business. We generate the aforementioned squatting variants of the target
domains, and match them against our NRD feed and pDNS hostnames. Additionally, we
cluster weekly collections of NRDs to see if registration campaigns target known brands.
After the initial discovery step, we leverage WHOIS data to filter out defensive registrations
and a heuristic rule-based classifier to identify which domains are true squatting domains.
Figure 1 shows the daily detection statistics for December 2019. During this period, we
detected 13,857 squatting domains (~450 per day). Since then, the number of daily
detections fluctuate from 200-900. To understand how these domains are leveraged for
abuse, we use URL Filtering to categorize them. We label domain names as malicious if
they are involved in distributing malware or phishing, or if they are being used for command
and control (C2) communication. We label domains categorized as grayware, parked,
questionable, insufficient content and high-risk as suspicious. The average malicious rate of
the 13,857 squatting domains is 18.59% (2,595) and the average suspicious rate is 36.57%
(5,104).

5/27

Figure 1. Volume and malicious and suspicious rates of daily domain squatting in December
2019.
Next, we compare our detection of squatting domains to vendors found on VirusTotal.
Considering detection delays, we allow a 10-day time window for malicious squatting
domains to appear on VirusTotal. Figure 2 shows how well the top 10 vendors detected
these malicious and high-risk domains. The best-performing vendor covers about 25% of the
malicious or high-risk squatting domains that we detected. Meanwhile, other vendors cover
less than 20% of our detections. Lastly, we found that 55% of malicious or high-risk squatting
domains are not detected by any vendors.

2019.

The Domain Squatting Ecosystem
To identify malicious infrastructure hotspots, we studied specific network elements and
entities that typosquatters depend on for their operations. Specifically, we studied popular
registrars, name services, autonomous systems and certificate authorities used by domain
squatters.
For each chart outlined below, we considered the number of squatting detections to reflect
their popularity among domain squatters, and the malicious IOC rate to quantify the degree
of threat to users. Combining these two metrics, we calculated the adjusted malicious rate of
each entity. Thus, a high adjusted malicious rate means that an entity is either targeted by
many squatting domains or most of these squatting domains are malicious.
Top 20 Most Abused Domains
Domain squatters prefer popular and thus profitable targets. Figure 3 shows the Top 20 most
abused domains. These targets are popular websites, such as mainstream search engines
and social media, financial, shopping and banking websites. Squatting domains mimicking
these websites benefit from their credibility to attract more users that can be scammed.
Therefore, these targets have relatively high squatting detection numbers.

Figure 3. Top 20 most abused domains in December 2019.
Top 10 Most Abused DNS Services and Autonomous Systems
Next, we look at the DNS services and the autonomous systems (AS) used by squatting
domains to understand their infrastructure preferences. An AS is a set of IP subnets
maintained by one or more network operators.
The name service used by domain squatters often signifies which registrar was used to
register the domain, where the squatting web page is hosted or which parking service these
domains utilize to profit from user traffic. Figure 4 displays the most abused name services of
squatting domains. Freenom.com and dnspod.com are often used by domain squatters, as
they provide cheap or free domain registration and domain hosting. DNSPod is known for
hosting shady DNS records and for providing services for malicious bulletproof hosting
operators. Level-squatters might choose to use registrar.eu as it supports an unlimited
number of subdomains and free URL forwarding, which reduces the cost of deploying and
scaling attacks.

8/27

Figure 4. Top 10 most abused DNS services in December 2019.
Additionally, parkingcrew.net and above.com are popular parking services because they
provide a simple monetization avenue to domain owners, achieved by pointing domain
names’ DNS records to their name servers. Parking services usually show users parked
pages laden with ads or redirect users to affiliate marketing or malicious websites.
As hosting services often have their own AS, we observed that the AS distribution is
somewhat consistent with the name service distribution. The top three most abused AS
(19495, 48635, 262254) belong to the three most abused name service providers,
respectively (freenom.com, registrar.eu, ddos-guard.net). The fourth most abused AS
(40034) is owned by ztomy.com, a service favored for DNS hijacking attacks.

Figure 5. Top 10 most abused autonomous systems in December 2019.
Top 10 Most Abused Registrars
Registrars are entities that sell domain names to users. The most abused registrar,
Internet.bs, provides free services preferred by domain squatters, including privacy-protected
registration and URL forwarding. We captured several level-squatting campaigns at this
registrar. In these campaigns, attackers set up hundreds of subdomains mimicking popular
target domains under com-secure-login[.]info and com-finder-me[.]info. An example levelsquatting subdomain is www.icloud.com-secure-login[.]info. The second-most abused
registrar, Openprovider, offers cheap and easy bulk registrations, attracting many squatting
registrations. Additionally, we observed many domains from this registrar having their
WHOIS records redacted for privacy. Our system discovered many level-squatting domains
registered at TLD Registrar Solutions using the .support TLD (top-level domain), including
icloud.com-iphone[.]support and apple.com.recover[.]support, which users might confuse
with legitimate Apple technical support services.

Top 5 Most Abused Certificate Authorities
As HTTPS became common, cybercriminals increased the use of certificates to make their
websites appear legitimate. Figure 7 provides an overview of the certificate authorities (CAs)
preferred by squatting sites. The most popular CA is Cloudflare, as it offers a bundle,
including free SSL encryption. The second most popular CA, cPanel Inc CA, is preferred by
domain squatters because of the convenience and the ease of its AutoSSL services.
Through cPanel’s management interface, their customers are able to finish all steps of SSL

encryption, including certificate purchase, automatic installation and renewal. Thawte CA is
not a trusted CA anymore, and browsers will label their certificate as suspicious, but
squatting domains are still using it.

Malicious Usages and Threats
In this section, we discuss in detail different types of abuse leveraging squatting domains. It
includes malware distribution, phishing, C2 communication, potentially unwanted programs
(PUPs), scams, ad-laden sites and affiliate marketing.
Phishing

12/27

Phishing is one of the most popular threats leveraging squatting domains. All of the different
squatting techniques we discussed can be used to lure users into believing that a squatting
domain is owned by the legitimate brand and to increase the efficiency of phishing and scam
campaigns.
One example is a combosquatting domain, secure-wellsfargo[.]org, which targets Wells
Fargo’s customers. This domain hosts a copy of Wells Fargo’s official site, as illustrated in
Figure 8.a. However, this site is only the front-end portion of the original site, redirecting all
clicks to the same login page (shown in Figure 8.b) to steal customers’ sensitive information,
including email credentials and ATM PINs.

Figure 8.b. Phishing login page for secure-wellsfargo[.]orgFigure 9 demonstrates how
another combosquatting domain, amazon-india[.]online, mimicking Amazon, is set up to
steal user credentials, specifically targeting mobile users in India. As a common strategy, all
links on this site first redirect users to the same product page (the middle screenshot in
Figure 9) and then to the payment page. In this particular case, the perpetrators did not even
go through the trouble of optimizing the phishing page for desktop users.

Figure 9. Fake Amazon website: amazon-india[.]online

14/27

Malware Distribution
Squatting domains are also often used to distribute malware. A combosquatting domain
mimicking Samsung (samsungeblyaiphone[.]com) hosts Azorult malware
5acd6d9ac235104f90f9a39c11807c37cdfb103d6c151cc1a2e4e38bf3dbe41f on the URL
samsungeblyaiphone[.]com/dolce.exe. Azorult malware is a credential and payment card
information stealer, usually spread by phishing emails. It has been an active threat since
2016 and is one of the top malware families. Once the malware executes, it will generate a
unique identifier for the compromised machine based on the machine’s globally unique
identifier and username. Then the malware will contact the C2 server with this identifier, and
it will retrieve the configuration of the infected machine, including the running processes and
services. Additionally, Azorult malware often downloads payload from other compromised
servers. The new payload can collect and send out sensitive data such as cookies, browser
credentials and cryptocurrency information.
Analyzing the malware sample downloaded from samsungeblyaiphone[.]com, we found that
it attempted to send a POST request to samsungeblyaiphone[.]com/index.php, which is
consistent with this malware family’s known behavior to exfiltrate data. Besides the observed
network activity, the malware also displayed suspicious behaviors such as changing the
settings of Internet Explorer.
Command & Control (C2)
Malware instances on infected machines typically need to “phone home” to a C2 server for
further commands to execute, to download new payloads or to perform data exfiltration.
Malware often relies on domain names to locate C2 servers, and these domains are called
C2 domains. While using squatting domains for C2 is uncommon, we speculate that the
intention of those who do so is to evade automated detection (such as Domain Generation
Algorithm detection) and manual analysis.
Our squatting detection system captured squatting domains mimicking Microsoft, microsoftstore-drm-server[.]com on January 30, 2020, and microsoft-sback-server[.]com on February
3, 2020. From the Palo Alto Networks WildFire Malware Analysis Engine, we retrieved
similar malware samples, including
fa28b59eb0ccd21d3994b0778946679497399b72c2e256ebf2434553cb7bf373 and
e7fb436bf7d8784da092315bce1d3511a6055da41fe67362bad7a4c5d3f0294e , connecting to
them. These two domain names used the previously mentioned DNSPod for name
resolution, which is infamous for being slow in responding to abuse investigations. First, the
malware resolved these domains to the same IP address 217.182.227[.]117. Then, it
communicated through SSL traffic with the same JA3 (SSL fingerprint):
6312930a139fa3ed22b87abb75c16afa on client-side and
4192c0a946c5bd9b544b4656d9f624a4 on server-side. Observing the same behavior, we
conclude they were using the identical SSL application and were part of the same campaign.

15/27

Similar to most C2 domains, these two squatting domains were short-lived. They were only
used for one to two days after registration and were then abandoned by attackers. Tracking
217.182.227[.]117, we are able to find other C2 domains used by this campaign: store-inbox[.]com from Jan. 27-28, stt-box[.]com from Jan. 29-31, microsoft-store-drm-server[.]com
from Jan. 31-Feb. 2, and microsoft-sback-server[.]com on February 3.
Potentially Unwanted Program (PUP)
A PUP could be either standalone software, like spyware or adware, or a browser extension.
PUPs usually perform unwanted changes, like changing the browser's default page or
hijacking the browser to insert ads. Researchers have shown that some PUP downloaders
are also repurposed for malware campaigns. Websites hosting PUPs usually try to scare
users by showing them warning messages like “Your computer is infected!” or “Your license
has expired!” to convince them to download the advertised software.
Figure 10 shows a combosquatting domain mimicking Walmart (walrmart44[.]com) that
distributes PUP. Depending on the browser used, it redirects users to landing pages offering
different types of PUPs for download. When we visit this domain in Safari, it tells us that our
Flash player might be outdated and offers us the chance to download the newest version
from their site, as illustrated in Figure 10.a. While using Chrome, we get a “click continue and
install extension” page, as shown in Figure 10.b, which redirects users to the Chrome store
for the “Security for Chrome” extension. Alternatively, this website will occasionally redirect
users to various legitimate ecommerce websites, including Walmart, Amazon and Aliexpress.
After repeated visits, it will remember the source IP address and reject further visits even if
we use different browsers (Figure 10.c).

news website with a valid SSL certificate. However, visiting this site, users are faced with
popup windows, warning them about security flaws (Figure 11.a). Clicking on the warnings,
users are redirected to a fake virus scanning page, which recognizes their operating system
to increase credibility but will always display the same list of detected viruses (Figure 11.b).
Finally, clicking the “Proceed” button takes users to a download page for a system repair tool,
which is legitimate but potentially unwanted.

Technical Support Scam
Technical support scams are social engineering attacks. An associated website’s purpose is
to scare people with audio and visual warnings into believing that their machine is
compromised. It prompts people to call the displayed fake technical support center’s phone
number. When people call the number, scammers will try to persuade them that the only way
to save their machine is by paying for the fraudulent support service. In the case of
combosquatting, the domain name often contains keywords like “security,” “alert” and
“warning.” An example domain mimicking Microsoft (microsoft-alert[.]club) shown in Figure
12.a was registered on June 11, 2020. This website presents warning messages in
Japanese (translated to English in Figure 12.b), renders dynamic content, such as a running
command line window, and plays audio alerts.

Figure 12.a. A technical support scam page hosted on microsoft-alert[.]club

19/27

Figure 12.b. Translated to English.
Re-bill Scam
Re-bill scammers first offer a subscription to products such as weight loss pills in exchange
for a small initial payment. However, if users don’t cancel the subscription after the promotion
period, a much higher cost will be charged to their credit cards, usually $50-100. Additional
information on this type of scam can be found in Unit 42’s previous research on deceptive
affiliate marketing. The combosquatting domain netflixbrazilcovid[.]com leverages both
Netflix and the COVID-19 pandemic. The main page looks like the Portuguese Netflix site
(Figure 13.a), and has the purpose of obtaining user email addresses. (It is shown translated
to English in Figure 13.b.) A deceptive reward message (Figure 13.c) is then shown to
potential victims. Finally, users are redirected to a survey and then to a re-bill scam page
(Figure 13.d).

Reward Scam
Another popular scam offers users rewards such as free products or money. When we
initially captured facebookwinners2020[.]com, it was under development with placeholder
images and texts, as shown in Figure 14.a. However, the perpetrators recently replaced
placeholders with meaningful content. From the screenshot, we could tell the page mimics a
free lottery related to Facebook. To claim the prize, users need to fill out a form with their
personal information such as date of birth, phone number, occupation and income (Figure
14.b).

information.
Domain Parking

23/27

A common and easy way to monetize user traffic is to use a parking service by pointing the
squatting domain’s IP address or NS record to the parking service’s servers. Figure 15
provides an example of a parked domain mimicking RBC Royal Bank, rbyroyalbank[.]com,
leveraging a popular parking service, ParkingCrew, to generate profit based on how many
users land on the site and click the advertisements. In some cases, parking services also
redirect users to scam and phishing pages. As the hostname in the certificate is different
from the squatting domain, the browser will label it as “Not secure.” Parked pages usually
show users a list of advertisements related to the parked domain. In our example, the ads
shown are related to financial services.

Figure 15. A parked page for rbyroyalbank[.]com

Conclusion
In summary, domain squatting techniques leverage the fact that users rely on domain names
to identify brands and services on the Internet. These squatting domains are often used for
nefarious activities, including phishing, malware and PUP distribution, C2 and various
scams. A high rate of malicious and suspicious usage among squatting domains was
observed. Therefore, continuous monitoring and analysis of these domains are necessary to
protect users.
Palo Alto Networks monitors newly registered domains and newly observed hostnames from
pDNS and Zone files to capture emerging squatting campaigns. Our automatic pipeline
publishes the domains it detects to URL Filtering and DNS Security using the appropriate
category, including malware, phishing, C2 or grayware.

24/27

Analyzing the squatting ecosystem, we found that domain squatters prefer certain types of
target domains, registrars, hosting services and certificate authorities. The following
attributes are common in cases of malicious squatted domains:
Domain names that are targeting known financial, shopping and banking domains.
Domains that use frequently abused registrars and hosting services.
Domains that do not have completely validated SSL certificates.
Therefore, we advise everyone to be more careful when encountering these domains.
Palo Alto Networks customers using URL Filtering, DNS Security, WildFire and Threat
Prevention are protected from the threats related to squatting domains mentioned in this
blog. Using AutoFocus, our customers can further study the malware mentioned in this blog
by using the tag AzoRult.
