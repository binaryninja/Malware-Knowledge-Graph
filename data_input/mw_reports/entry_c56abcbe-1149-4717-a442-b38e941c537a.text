Analysis of the Predator Pain Keylogger
Written by Kimberly on Sunday, 27 April 2014. Posted in Malware Reports Viewed 11403

The Predator Pain Keylogger incorporates Browser, Messenger, FTP and File stealers
and is able of Clipboard and Screenhot logging, Bitcoin Wallet theft.
Predator Pain targets Steam, MineCraft and World of WarCraft usernames and
passwords. A Runescape Pin Stealer is also available.
Predator Pain can disable several Windows features and spread via USB or P2P.
KazyLoader, also known as Karagany, is used as the file downloader in this sample.
The Predator Pain Keylogger is advertised for 35$ on underground forums and comes with
its own crypter.
Predator Pain is the payload of an unsolicited email from the IRS with the subject line
"Swift Transfer Confirmation". No money at the horizon in this fake email but a swift
transfer of all logins and passwords the Predator Pain Keylogger can possibly grab.
Predator Pain Keylogger
Upon execution SWIFTTRANSFERRECEPTS_FDP.EXE will display an error message
stating that the application failed to initialize properly. The warning is a fake error
message and part of the Predator Pain builder options.

1/11

In meanwhile SWIFTTRANSFERRECEPTS_FDP.EXE will create a copy of itself as
WINLOGON.EXE in the %AppData%\Roaming folder and start the newly created process.
WINLOGON.EXE will also create a global Low Level Keyboard hook and display the same
fake error as above.

WINLOGON.EXE creates the following files in the %AppData%\Roaming folder:
pid.txt: contains the PID of the Predator Pain Keylogger process - e.g. 1628
pidloc.txt: contains the path to the Predator Pain logger executable - e.g.
%AppData%\Roaming\winlogon.exe

2/11

Predator Pain will also create a copy of itself as WINDOWSUPDATE.EXE in the
%AppData%\Roaming folder. Predator Pain checks periodically for the existence of
WindowsUpdate.exe. If the file is deleted a new copy is written to the HDD.

The following registry keys are created to ensure persistence:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run "Windows
Update"
Type: REG_SZ
Data: C:\Users\MxAngel\AppData\Roaming\WindowsUpdate.exe
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon
"Shell"
Type: REG_SZ
Data: explorer.exe, C:\Users\MxAngel\AppData\Roaming\winlogon.exe
Before we go any further there are a few things that need clarification. When the Predator
Pain binary - winlogon.exe in our analysis - is running, we can dump the strings contained
in the different memory regions. The list is quite huge but for now we will focus on the
three following elements:
WebBrowserPassView: WebBrowserPassView.exe
Mail PassView: mailpv.exe
CMemoryExecute: CMemoryExecute.dll
WebBrowserPassView

WebBrowserPassView, developed by Nir Sofer, is a tool to recover lost passwords stored
in your web browser.
WebBrowserPassView supports Internet Explorer,Mozilla, Google Chrome, Safari, and
Opera and can be used to recover lost / forgotten passwords of any website, including
Facebook, Yahoo, Google, and GMail, as long as the password is stored by the browser.
The passwords can be saved to text / html / csv / xml files.
Mail PassView

Mail PassView, developed by Nir Sofer, allows extracting lost email passwords from the
following email clients:
Outlook Express
Microsoft Outlook 2000 (POP3 and SMTP Accounts only)
Microsoft Outlook 2002/2003/2007/2010/2013 (POP3, IMAP, HTTP and SMTP
Accounts)
Windows Mail
Windows Live Mail
IncrediMail
Eudora
3/11

Netscape 6.x/7.x (If the password is not encrypted with master password)
Mozilla Thunderbird (If the password is not encrypted with master password)
Group Mail Free
Yahoo! Mail - If the password is saved in Yahoo! Messenger application.
Hotmail/MSN mail - If the password is saved in MSN/Windows/Live Messenger
application.
Gmail - If the password is saved by Gmail Notifier application, Google Desktop, or by
Google Talk.
CMemoryExecute - CMemoryExecute.dll

CMemoryExecute, written by Affixiate, is used to run a non .NET executable from
memory without storing it on the hard-disk first. It uses the native WinAPI and the
executable needs to be injected in VBC.EXE, the Visual Basic Command Line Compiler.
The syntax is as follows:
CMemoryExecute.Run(IO.File.ReadAllBytes("C:\run_me_in_memory.exe"),
"C:\inject_me_in_memory.exe", "(Optional) Command Line Parameters To Be Passed To
C:\run_me_in_memory.exe")

Predator Pain is thus able to harvest logins and passwords from several mail and browser
clients with the help of two incorporated legit programs: WebBrowserPassView and Mail
PassView.
Predator Pain will start up VBC.EXE, the Visual Basic Command Line Compiler, which is
one of the requirements to run a PE from memory.

The Predator Pain Keylogger will:
4/11

Run MAILPV.EXE from memory via VBC.EXE and dump the results to
HOLDERMAIL.TXT.
WINLOGON.EXE checks if HOLDERMAIL.TXT exists.
WINLOGON.EXE reads HOLDERMAIL.TXT and uploads the harvested email
credentials via mail - to This e-mail address is being protected from spambots. You
need JavaScript enabled to view it in our analysis.

The same tasks will be performed using WEBBROWSERPASSVIEW.EXE & VBC.EXE to
harvest stored passwords in browsers.

5/11

Below is a screenshot illustrating the flow of processes and services started by Predator
Pain. The Protected Storage and Credential Manager services are started by the injected
VBC.EXE process.

6/11

Besides harvesting various logins and passwords, Predator Pain reports the local Date
and Time, the OS and the OS language, the internal and external IP address, installed
antivirus and / or firewall. The external IP is obtained by querying whatismyipaddress.com.
In this sample all harvested information is send to This e-mail address is being protected
from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it . The interval and the chosen
method (FTP / PHP / MAIL) can be set in the Predator Pain builder’s options.

Predator Pain is also a Bitcoin Stealer. It steals the WALLET.DAT file that holds the users
bitcoin currency.

After a while the WINLOGON.EXE process stopped working. It’s hard to tell whether this is
on purpose or simply because the logger is unstable.

7/11

When the WINLOGON.EXE process runs, the code in memory is unencrypted and its
strings can be dumped from the different memory regions. I've posted a small snippet on
our Pastebin.
