10 years of virtual dynamite: A high-level retrospective
of ATM malware
blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/05/10-years-of-virtual-dynamite.html

Executive summary
It has been 10 years since the discovery of Skimer, ﬁrst malware speciﬁcally designed to
attack automated teller machines (ATMs). At the time, the learning curve for
understanding its functionality was rather steep and analysis required speciﬁc
knowledge of a manufacturer's ATM API functions and parameters, which were not
publicly documented.
Before the discovery of Skimer, anti-malware researchers' considered ATMs secure
machines containing proprietary hardware, running non-standard operating systems,
and implementing a number of advanced protection techniques designed to prevent
attacks using malicious code. Researchers eventually discovered that the most popular
ATM manufacturers use a standard Windows operating system and add on some
auxiliary devices, such as a safe and card reader.
Over time, actors behind some of the newer ATM malware families such as
GreenDispenser and Tyupkin realized that there is a generic Windows extension for
Financial Services API (CEN/XFS) that can be used to make malware that runs
independent of the underlying hardware platform, as long as the ATM manufacturer
supports the framework. This malware can trick the machines into dispensing cash,
regardless of whether the attacker has a legitimate bank card.
ATM malware has evolved to include a number of different families and different actors
behind them, ranging from criminal groups to actors afﬁliated with nation states. The
signiﬁcance of ATM malware stems from the fact that it can bring signiﬁcant ﬁnancial

beneﬁts to attackers and as a consequence cause a signiﬁcant damage to targeted
banks, ﬁnancial institutions and end users.
Now that this type of malware has been around for more than 10 years, we wanted to
round up the speciﬁc families we've seen during that time and attempt to ﬁnd out if the
different families share any code.

ATM malware overview
Signiﬁcance
ATM malware provided criminals with a subtler alternative to physically breaking into the
safe built into the ATM. Before the appearance of ATM malware, criminals typically had
to employ traditional ways of robbing ATMs, often pulling the physical device out of the
ground or blowing it to pieces with dynamite. Obviously, these methods would quickly
draw the attention of law enforcement and passersby.
Over the past 10 years, we have seen a steady increase in the number of ATM malware
samples discovered. Still, the number of discovered samples is very small compared to
almost any other malware category.

Number of ATM malware samples discovered year over year based on the year of ﬁrst
submission to VirusTotal.
As a digital substitute for dynamite, ATM malware allows criminals to employ money
mules and instruct them how to dispense money from targeted ATMs. Typically, it
happens by supplying a special authorisation code or card created to authorise the
transaction.
Before that, criminals had to infect the targeted ATM to install the code, which more often
than not meant that they had to physically open the device to access its optical media
reading devices or USB ports.

There have been many reported attacks on various banking organizations throughout
the world, but they seem to be more prevalent in Latin America and Eastern Europe,
where the ATM infrastructure is older and are not regularly updated with security
software or tamper-proof sensors. The damage caused by ATM malware to banks and
individuals is rarely disclosed but it likely reaches millions of dollars a year.
ATM malware affects banks and other ﬁnancial institutions, as well as the reputation of
ATM manufacturers and individuals and companies whose account details are stolen in
ATM malware attacks.

Classiﬁcation
There are several different ways we can classify ATM malware families. Based on its
functionality, we can classify ATM malware into virtual skimmers and cash dispensers.
The purpose of skimmers is to steal card and transaction details and individual PINs if
the encryption keys used by pin pad are successfully retrieved.
Cash-dispensing malware uses functions to allow for so-called "jackpotting" of ATMs
where money is dispensed by attackers without the authorisation from the bank. But
there are malware families that can steal card details and dispense cash.
As far as the installation process is concerned, we again have two major groups. The
ﬁrst one requires the attacker to physically access the device. The second group
assumes that the attacker installs malware indirectly, typically by compromising the
internal network of the bank and then targeting ATMs using stolen credentials.
These types of malware will also either target speciﬁc models of ATMs, or will be more
generic. Recently, ATM malware typically deploys generic functions.
The most common framework is the CEN/XFS framework, which allows the developers
of the ATM applications to compile and run their code regardless of the ATM model or
the manufacturer but there are others, such as Kalignite framework built on top of XFS.
The XFS API contains high-level functions for communicating with the various ATM
modules such as the cash dispensing module (CDM), PIN pad (EPP4) or printer. The
high-level functions are provided through a generic SDK, while the lower level functions,
supplied through service providers, are developed by ATM manufacturers. The
architecture is quite similar to Win32 architecture where the developers use the highlevel API to communicate with the OS kernel and various device drivers provided by the
manufacturers of the individual hardware components.

High-level CEN/XFS architecture.
Most ATM samples require physical access to the targeted ATM. ATMs are not typically
connected to the internet and communicate with bank's central systems through
specialized lines. However, most of the ATMs are connected to internal networks for their
maintenance and administration so the second, smaller group of ATM malware may be
introduced by compromising the internal network ﬁrst. This technique requires a higher
level of sophistication but potentially brings higher returns if successful.
Some generic hacking tools, such as Cobalt Strike, have reportedly been used for
attacking ATMs and the transaction systems. This method has been more commonly
used by more advanced groups such as Carbanak, Cobalt Gang and Lazarus (Group
77), whose Fastcash attack affects IBM AIX operating system, which is rarely targeted
by malware.

Notable ATM malware families and their functionality
Over the past 10 years, we have seen more than 30 different ATM malware families. In
this section, we will brieﬂy describe some of the more notable ones.

Number of ATM malware samples per family.
Ploutus
Ploutus is the malware family with the largest number of discovered samples. The
majority of them having been reported in Mexico. Ploutus is a standard ATM-dispensing
malware. The attackers need to be able to access physical ports or a CD-ROM drive to
be able to boot from it and modify the ATM system image to install the malware.
Attackers allegedly used newer Ploutus variants to attack some U.S.-based ATMs.
Ploutus.D communicates with the ATM using the multi-vendor KAL Kalignite framework,
which allows it to work with ATMs from different vendors with minimal changes to its
code base.

One of the Ploutus variant's interface.
Skimer
Skimer is one of the ﬁrst ATM attacks, and bears all of the features of well-developed
malware. Skimer functions as a virtual skimming device that attempts to steal bank card
numbers and details of the account and owner details stored on the magnetic stripe
tracks 1 and 2. A recent review of its functionality also indicates that it may also attempt
to steal users' PINs by retrieving the encrypted pin pad encryption keys from the system.
Apart from the virtual skimming function, Skimer acts as a backdoor to the ATM
functionality for its operators — money mules employed to collect stolen data and
dispense cash.

Main code loop for servicing Skimer's operators with cash.
If the user knows the secret code to activate the backdoor, the malware displays a
menu, which allows the operator to empty one of the four cash-dispensing modules
(CDMs).

The code locking the dispenser module and dispensing cash.
Most of the other ATM malware families follow a similar principle. The attackers need to
be able to physically access the ATM, which requires a key or drilling a hole to access
speciﬁc ports or devices. Once the malware is deployed, the money mules need a
speciﬁc code to access the menu and dispense cash.
Tyupkin (Padpin)

The most interesting characteristic of Tyupkin is that it has the ability to limit its operation
to speciﬁc hours and days of the week. It was reported that some Tyupkin instances can
only be used on Sundays and Mondays at night.

Tyupkin function for checking the hours of operation.
Before dispensing cash, Tyupkin disables any network connections, presumably to
prevent administrators from shutting down the ATM if a suspicious activity is detected.
Some members of Tyupkin family are developed using C# and the .NET framework and
some using Microsoft Visual C++. The family uses XFS API to manage infected ATMs
and dispense cash in multiple currencies. Tyupkin has been active since 2014 and the
associated gangs reportedly target Eastern European countries.
Alice
Alice follows a similar pattern to other ATM malware. It is installed by attackers and
requires physical access to the system. When the operator launches it, Alice displays a
window requiring a PIN.

First Alice screen.
If the code is correct, Alice will access the dispenser module and allow the operator to
retrieve cash.

Main Alice UI window.
Cutlet
Cutlet, or Cutlet Maker, has been sold as a do-it-yourself ATM malware kit on some
underground markets since 2016. The bundle contains detailed instructions in Russian
and English on how to infect systems and how to acquire codes required to dispense
cash.

Main Cutlet Maker user interface.
The Cutlet manual details operational security practices required to avoid being caught
by law enforcement ofﬁcers and shows where to drill holes in the ATM enclosure in order
to access USB ports of a speciﬁc ATM model. The kit also contains a testing application
named "Stimulator" for users to practice before they decide to conduct real attacks.

Cutlet follows a similar pattern to the previous ATM malware. The owner of the kit has
the ability to generate codes per ATM required for its operation.
Fastcash
The signiﬁcance of Fastcash malware is its mode of operation and its targeting of IBM
AIX operating system. Fastcash consists of a process injector and shared objects
presumably injected into the process space of compromised bank payment authorization
systems. The malware monitors ISO8583-based transactions using code from a fairly old
open-source library for parsing ISO8583 packets.
If an ATM transaction contains the attackers' codes, the data will not be forwarded to the
original payment authorisation application and the transaction approval will be sent back
to the target ATM system allowing attackers to dispense cash.
This mode of operation is similar to some rootkits, where malware attempts to hide its
presence on the system by modifying the responses sent back from the operating
system to the application that attempts to list system objects such as ﬁles or processes.
The returned list is usually modiﬁed to remove names of processes that belong to the
malware.
Fastcash has been attributed to the Lazarus Group and it is an example of a nationstate-related actor targeting ﬁnancial systems for the attacker's ﬁnancial beneﬁt.
Fastcash shows a level of sophistication and knowledge that is not seen in other, run-ofthe-mill, ATM malware.

Code sharing between families
Thanks to Xylitol and the ATM Cybercrime tracker, it was easy to retrieve a fairly
complete ATM malware data set, with the addition of the few ﬁles connected with the
Fastcash campaign.
The data set contains 121 ﬁles and it is well suited for analysis and clustering. Out of
121 ﬁles, there are 114 PE ﬁles and those were used for clustering using the static
analysis techniques. Out of 114 PE ﬁles there were 37 packed ﬁles which may not be
suitable for static analysis techniques and 20 DLLs.
While investigating various methods for clustering, we stumbled upon an interesting
book, "Malware Data Science" by Joshua Saxe and Hillary Sanders. This book shows
basic and more advanced methods for classifying and clustering malicious ﬁles and used
some of the ideas to cluster our own set.
In our case, the clustering was conducted by extracting the following attributes of each
sample:
Strings extracted from the ﬁle
Disassembled code from the entry point of the ﬁle
File entropy and the presence of a known packer
Imported or exported functions
Embedded resources

After collecting the attributes from each sample, Jaccard distance is calculated for every
pair of the ﬁles in the set. The Jaccard index is a measure of similarity between two sets.
The more similar the two samples are, the higher their Jaccard index will be. The index
is a number between 0 and 1. For example, the Jaccard index of 0.5 indicates 50
percent overlap between the two sets.

Clusters with Jaccard index threshold of 0.7.
We need to set the threshold required for two samples to be connected as a part of a
single cluster. The higher the Jaccard threshold we choose, the more related will be the
members of the deﬁned cluster. By varying the threshold we come to the optimal value
for our purpose. For example, for correct classiﬁcation of samples we should choose the
value higher than 0.7, and for code sharing purposes, higher than 0.3.
As expected, the results show that as we lower the thresholds we see more clusters
appear and some of the clusters show overlap between distinct ATM malware families.

The width of the lines in the graph show how strongly the ﬁles in the clusters are related.
For example, we see that the members of individual GreenDispenser, Tyupkin or
DispCash clusters are very closely related, while mixed Ligsterac/Skimer,
Tyupkin/Dispcash and ATMtest/Helloworld clusters show weaker connections that likely
indicate some overlap in the malware code.

Protection and detection best practices
When considering protection and detection of attacks with ATM malware, it is important
to consider the physical security of ATMs, the security of software running on the system
and the security of any segment of the organization's network that communicates with
ATMs.
Here are 15 best practices that organizations should follow when considering protection
of ATMs networks and successful and timely detection of attacks when they happen.
Ensure ATMs and all related systems run up-to-date software and the latest
operating system versions with the latest security patches applied.
Disable Windows AutoPlay and conﬁgure BIOS to disable the ability to boot
software from USB sticks and CD/DVD drives. Set strong BIOS password
protection to prevent boot settings from being changed.
Disable access to the Windows desktop at the ATM, ensure RDP sessions are
secured with multiple authentication factors such as Duo Authentication for
Windows Logon and RDP.
Remove any unused services and applications from the system to reduce the
attack surface. Implement other measures to harden the underlying ATM operating
system.
Monitor the operation of ATMs, as well as their physical integrity. Look for unusual
patterns of resets, communication failures and transaction volume.
Implement strong encryption between the ATM and the host.
Ensure access to the ATM cabinet is restricted to authorized persons and that
such access is electronically logged.
Perform a security assessment of ATMs, including their physical locations and any
networks connecting to them.
Ensure that ﬁrewalls and anti-malware protection are correctly conﬁgured.
Conﬁgure whitelisting solutions or operating system features to allow only known,
trusted software to run. Make sure that whitelisting cannot be disabled without
generating a remote log entry.
Prevent unauthorized USB devices from being installed using a device control
function.
Educate employees about how they can avoid introducing malware into
operational systems.
Maintain a physically and logically segmented network environment throughout the
organization using segmentation technology such as Cisco TrustSec.
Ensure visibility over network trafﬁc to ATM systems and payment authorisation
servers using technology that enhance network visibility, such as Cisco
Stealthwatch.

Monitor threat intelligence feeds to learn about newly detected ATM malware
threats.

Conclusion
ATM malware is a niche area attacks, but it potentially brings signiﬁcant beneﬁts to
actors that successfully manage to deploy it. Over 10 years since the discovery of the
ﬁrst specialized malicious code targeting the Diebold Agilis line of ATMs, we have seen
over 30 other malware families with varying degrees of sophistication, complexity and
success. Most of the successful attacks are reported in countries where the ATMs are
older, such as some Latin American countries and Eastern Europe.
While the majority of actors behind ATM malware seem to be less sophisticated criminal
actors, the potential of being able to dispense large amounts of cash also attracts more
sophisticated criminal groups such as Carbanak and Cobalt Gang, as well as some
state-sponsored actors such as Lazarus.
Although the number of known malware samples for ATMs has been very low there has
been a steady increase in the trendline for number of discovered samples year over
year.
Financial organizations and banks have to be particularly vigilant when considering
protection against malware for ATMs and payment systems. Enterprises and individuals
may also experience ﬁnancial loss due to potential of their card details being used for
illegal transactions after being skimmed by ATM malware. Best practices should be
followed to ensure the highest possible level of protection and organizations should
invest into increasing user awareness about the dangers of ATM malware.
