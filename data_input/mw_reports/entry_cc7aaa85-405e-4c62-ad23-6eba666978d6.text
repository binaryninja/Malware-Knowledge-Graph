The criminal group behind the BlackMatter ransomware have announced plans today to shut
down their operation, citing pressure from local authorities.
The group announced its plan in a message posted in the backend of their Ransomware-asa-Service portal, where other criminal groups typically register in order to get access to the
BlackMatter ransomware strain.
The message, dated to Monday, November 1, 2021, and obtained by a member of the vxunderground infosec group, is pictured above and translated below:

Due to certain unsolvable circumstances associated with pressure from the authorities
(part of the team is no longer available, after the latest news) – the project is closed.
After 48 hours, the entire infrastructure will be turned off, it is allowed to:
-Issue mail to companies for further communication.
-Get decryptors, for this write “give a decryptor” inside the company chat where they
are needed.
We wish you all success, we were glad to work.
While the group did not explain the “latest news” that led to its decision to shut down, their
announcement comes after three major events that have taken place over the past two
weeks.
The first of these were reports from Microsoft and Gemini Advisory that linked the FIN7
cybercrime group, considered the creators of the Darkside and BlackMatter strains, to
a public cybersecurity firm named Bastion Secure, through which they allegedly recruited
unwitting collaborators.
The second was the fact that security Emsisoft had secretly developed a decryption utility for
the BlackMatter ransomware strain, which the company had been secretly offering to victims
in order to avoid them paying the group’s ransom demands, putting a dent in its profits.
The third was a report from the New York Times this Sunday that announced that the US and
Russia had started a closer collaboration aimed at cracking down on Russia-based
cybercrime and ransomware gangs, among others. This is of importance because the FIN7
group has been historically believed to operate out of Russia.

Political pressure mounting on ransomware gangs
FIN7’s recent announcement also comes after the operators and members of multiple
ransomware operations have been hunted and arrested all over the world this summer.
For example, in their previous incarnation as the Darkside ransomware, the FIN7 group had
to pull the plug on their operation after their servers were hacked and cryptocurrency funds
were stolen, following a suspected law enforcement action.
In addition, rival ransomware gang REvil shut down not once, but twice, with the second time
in October, after law enforcement backdoored and hijacked their dark web servers.
Furthermore, just last week, Europol detained a Ukrainian group who orchestrated more than
1,800 ransomware attacks with strains such as LockerGoga, MegaCortex, and Dharma,
including the devastating attack on aluminum producer Norsk Hydro in early 2019.

This period of intense pressure on ransomware gangs comes after attacks have reached an
all-time high this year, with some attacks causing major issues across the world. Examples
here include the Darkside ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline (caused fuel supply
issues for the US East Coast), the REvil attack on JBS Foods (disrupted meat supply across
the US), and the REvil attack on Kaseya (disrupted thousands of companies across the
globe).
As Jeff Moss, founder of the Black Hat and DEF CON security conferences, said earlier
today on Twitter, law enforcement agencies have typically known the identities of most
ransomware operators but have also known they couldn’t go after some groups because of
Russia’s uncooperative behavior, something that appears to be changing – based on
BlackMatter’s statement.
Suggests the authorities have known all along and only once the pressure increased
did they act. It’s examples like that that convinced me that ransomware is at least 50%
a political problem. https://t.co/1Yi6KxriMD
