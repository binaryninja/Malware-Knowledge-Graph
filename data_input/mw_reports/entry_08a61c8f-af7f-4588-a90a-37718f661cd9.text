Summary
Flubot is an Android based malware that has been distributed in the past 1.5 years in
Europe, Asia and Oceania affecting thousands of devices of mostly unsuspecting victims.
Like the majority of Android banking malware, Flubot abuses Accessibility Permissions and
Services
in order to steal the victim’s credentials, by detecting when the official banking application
is open to show a fake web injection, a phishing website similar to the login form of the
banking
application. An important part of the popularity of Flubot is due to the distribution
strategy used in its campaigns, since it has been using the infected devices to send
text messages, luring new victims into installing the malware from a fake website.
In this article we detail its development over time and recent developments regarding
its disappearance, including new features and distribution campaigns.

Introduction
One of the most popular active Android banking malware families today. An “inspiration” for
developers of other Android banking malware families. Of course we are talking about
Flubot. Never heard of it? Let us give you a quick summary.
Flubot banking malware families are in the wild since at least the period between late 2020
and the first quarter of 2022. Most of its popularity comes from its distribution method:
smishing. Threat Actors (TA) have been using the infected devices to send text messages to
other phone numbers, stolen from other infected devices and stored in Command-andControl servers (C2).
In the initial campaigns, TAs used fake Fedex, DHL and Correos – a local Spanish parcel
shipping company – SMS messages. Those SMS messages were fake notifications which
lured the user into a fake website in order to download a mobile application to track the
shipping. These campaigns were very successful, since nowadays most people are used to
buy different kinds of products online and receive that type of messages to track the shipping
of the product.
Flubot is not only a very active family: TAs have been very actively introducing new features,
support for campaigns in new countries and improving the features it already had.
On June 1, 2022, Europol announced the takedown of Flubot in a joint operation including 11
countries. The Dutch Police played a key part in this operation and successfully disrupted the
infrastructure in May 2022, rendering this strain of malware inactive. That was interesting

2/30

period of time to look back at the early days of Flubot, how it evolved and became so
notorious.
In this post we want to share all we know about this threat and a timeline of the most relevant
and interesting (new) features and changes that Flubot’s TAs have introduced. We will focus
on these features and changes related to the detected samples but also in the different
campaigns that TAs have been using to distribute this malware.

The beginning: A new Android Banking Malware targeting Spain
[Flubot versions 0.1-3.3]

Based on reports from other researchers, Flubot samples were first found in the wild
between November and December of 2020. Public information about this malware was first
published on 6 January 2021 by our partner ThreatFabric
(https://twitter.com/ThreatFabric/status/1346807891152560131). Even though ThreatFabric
was the first to publish public information on this new family and called it “Cabassous”, the
research community has been more commonly referring to this malware as Flubot.

In the initial campaigns, Flubot was distributed using Fedex and Correos fake SMS
messages. In those messages, the user was led to a fake website which was basically a
“landing page” style website to download what was supposed to be an Android application to
track the incoming shipping.

3/30

In this initial campaign versions prior to Flubot 3.4 were used, and TAs were including
support for new campaigns in other countries using specific samples for each country. The
reasons why there were different samples for different countries were:
4/30

– Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA). It was using a different seed to generate 5.000
different domains per month. Just out of curiosity: For Germany, TAs were using 1945 as
seed for the DGA.
– Phone country code used to send more distribution smishing SMS messages from infected
devices and block those numbers in order to avoid communication among victims.
There were no significant changes related to features in the initial versions (from 0.1 to 3.3).
TAs were mostly focused on the distribution campaigns, trying to infect as many devices as
possible.
There is one important change in the initial versions, but it is difficult to find the exact version
in which this change was first introduced because there are some version without samples
on public repositories. TAs introduced web injections to steal credentials, the most popular
tactic to steal credentials on Android devices. This was introduced starting between versions
0.1 and 0.5, in December 2020.
In those initial versions, TAs increased the version number of the malware in just a few days
without adding significant changes. Most of the samples – particularly previous to 2.1 – were
not uploaded to public malware repositories, making it even harder to track the first versions
of Flubot.

5/30

On these initial versions (after 0.5), TAs also introduced other not so popular features like the
“USSD” one which was used to call to special numbers to earn money (“RUN_USSD”
command), it was introduced at some point between versions 1.2 and 1.7. In fact, it seems
this feature wasn’t really used by Flubot’s TAs. Most used features were the web injections to
steal banking and cryptocurrency platform credentials and sending SMS features to
distribute and infect new devices.

6/30

From version 2.1 to 2.8 we observed TAs started to use a different packer for the actual
Flubot’s payload. It could explain why we weren’t able to find samples on public repositories
between 2.1 and 2.8, probably there were some “internal” versions
used to try different packers and/or make it work with the new one.

March 2021: New countries and improvements on distribution
campaigns [Flubot versions 3.4-3.7]

After a few months apparently focused on distribution campaigns and not really on new
features for the malware itself, we have found version 3.4 in which TAs introduced some
changes on the DGA code. In this version, they reduced the number of generated domains
from 5.000 to 2.500 a month. At first sight this looks like a minor change, but is one of the
first changes to start distributing the malware in different countries in a more easy way for
TAs, since a different sample with different parameters was used for each country.
In fact, we can see a new version (3.6) customized for targeting victims in Germany in March
18, 2021. Only five days later, another version was released (3.7), with interesting changes.
TAs were trying to use the same sample for campaigns in Spain and Germany, including
Spanish and German phone country codes split by newline character to block
the phone number to which the infected device is sending smishing messages.

7/30

At the same time, TAs introduced a new campaign on Hungary. By the end of March, TAs
introduced a new change on version 3.7: an important change in their DGA, since they
replaced “.com” TLD with “.su”. This change was important for tracking Flubot, since now
TAs could use this new TLD to register new C2’s domains.
8/30

April 2021: DoH and unique samples for all campaigns [Flubot
versions 3.9-4.0]

It seems TAs were working since late March on a new version: Flubot 3.9. In this new
version, they introduced DNS-over-HTTPs (DoH). This new feature was used to resolve
domain names generated by the DGA. This way, it was more difficult to detect infected
devices in the network, since security solutions were not able to check
which domains were being resolved.
In the following images we show decompiled code of this new version, including the new
DoH code. TAs kept the old classic DNS resolving code. TAs introduced code to randomly
choose if DoH or classic DNS should be used.

9/30

10/30

The introduction of DoH was not the only feature that was added to Flubot 3.9. TAs also
added some UI messages to prepare future campaigns targeting Italy.
Those messages were used a few days later in the new Flubot 4.0 version, in which TAs
finally started to use one single sample for all of the campaigns – no more unique samples to
targeted different countries.
With this new version, the targeted country’s parameters used on previous version of Flubot
were chosen depending on the victim’s device language. This way, if the device language
was Spanish, then Spanish parameters were used. The following parameters were chosen:
– DGA seed
– Phone country codes used for smishing and phone number blocking

May 2021: Time for infrastructure and C2 server improvements
[Flubot versions 4.1-4.3]

May starts with a minor update on version 4.0 – a change the DoH servers used to resolve
DGA domains. Now instead of using CloudFlare’s servers they started using Google’s
servers. This was the first step to move to a new version, Flubot 4.1.
In this new version, TAs have changed one more time the DoH servers used to resolve the
C2 domains. In this case, they introduced three different services or DNS servers: Google,
CloudFlare and AliDNS. The last one was used for the first time in the life of Flubot to resolve

11/30

the DGA domains.

12/30

Those three different DoH services or servers were chosen randomly to resolve the
generated domains, to finally make the requests to any of the active C2 servers.
These changes also brought a new campaign in Belgium, in which TAs used fake BPost app
and smishing messages to lure new victims. One week later, new campaigns in Turkey were
also introduced, this time in a new Flubot version with important changes related to its C2
protocol.
The first samples of Flubot 4.2 appeared on 17 May 2021 with a few important changes in
the code used to communicate with the C2 servers. In this version, the malware was sending
HTTP requests with a new path in the C2: “p.php”, instead of the classic “poll.php” path.

13/30

At first sight it seemed like a minor change, but paying attention to the code we realized
there was an important reason behind this change: TAs changed the encryption method
used for the protocol to communicate with the C2 servers.
Previous versions of Flubot were using simple XOR encryption to encrypt the information
exchanged with the C2 servers, but this new version 4.2 was using
RC4 encryption to encrypt that information instead of the classic XOR. This way, the C2
server still supported old versions and new version at the same time:
poll.php and poll2.php were used to send/receive requests using the old XOR
encryption
p.php was used to send and receive requests using the new RC4 encryption

Besides the new protocol encryption on version 4.2, TAs also added at the end of May
support for new campaigns in Romania.
Finally, on 28 May 2021 new samples of Flubot 4.3 were discovered with minor changes,
mainly focused on the strings obfuscation implemented by the malware.

June 2021: VoiceMail. New campaign new countries [Flubot versions
4.4-4.6]

A few days after first samples of Flubot 4.3 were discovered – on May 31, 2021 and June 1,
2021 – new samples of Flubot were observed with version number bumped to 4.4.
One more time, no major changes in this new version. TAs added support for campaigns in
Portugal. As we can see with versions 4.3 and 4.4, it was common for Flubot’s TAs to bump
the version number in just a few days, with just minor changes. Some versions were not
even found in public repositories (e.g. version 3.3), which suggests that some versions were
14/30

never used in public or just skipped and TAs just bumped the version. Maybe those “lost
versions” lasted just a few hours in the distribution servers and were quickly updated to fix
bugs.
In the month of June the TAs hardly made any changes related to features, but instead they
were working on new distribution campaigns.
On version 4.5, TAs added Slovakia, Czech Republic, Greece and Bulgaria to the list of
supported countries for future campaigns. TAs reused the same DGA seed for all of them, so
it didn’t require too much work from their part to get this version released.
A few days after version 4.5 was observed, a new version 4.6 was discovered with new
countries added for future campaigns: Austria and Switzerland. Also, some countries that
were removed in previous versions were reintroduced: Sweden, Poland, Hungary, and The
Netherlands.
This new version of Flubot didn’t come only with more country coverage. TAs introduced a
new distribution campaign lure: VoiceMail. In this new “VoiceMail” campaign, infected
devices were used to send text messages to new potential victims using messages in which
the user was lead to a fake website. This time a “VoiceMail” app was installed, which should
allow the user to listen to the received Voice mail messages. In the following image we can
see the VoiceMail campaign for Spanish users.

July 2021: TAs Holidays [Flubot versions 4.7]

July 2021 is the month with less activity. In this month, only one version update was
observed at the very beginning of the month – Flubot 4.7. This new version came without the
usage of different DGA seeds by country or device language. TAs started to randomly
choose the seed from a list of seeds, which were the same seeds that were previously used

15/30

for country or device language.

Besides the changes related to the DGA seeds, TAs also introduced support for campaigns
in new countries: Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
There was almost no Flubot activity in summer. Our assumption is the developers were busy
with their summer holidays. As we will see in the following section, TAs will recover their
activity in August and October.

August-September 2021: Slow come back from Holidays [Flubot
versions 4.7-4.9]

During the first days of August, after TAs possibly enjoyed a nice holiday season, Australia
was added to version 4.7 in order to start distribution campaigns in that country.
Only a week later, TAs released the new version 4.8, in which we found some minor changes
mostly related to UI messages and alert dialogs.

16/30

One more version bump for Flubot was discovered on September, when version 4.9 came
out with some more minor changes, just like the previous version 4.8. This time, new web
injections were introduced in the C2 servers to steal credentials from victims. Those two new
versions with minor changes (not very relevant) seems like a relaxed come back to activity.
From our point of view, the most interesting thing that happened in those two months is that
TAs started to distribute another malware family using the Flubot botnet. We received from
C2 servers a few smishing tasks in which the fake “VoiceMail” website was serving Teabot
(also known as Anatsa and Toddler) instead of Flubot.
That was very interesting because it showed that Flubot’s TAs could be also associated with
this malware family or at least could be interested on selling the botnet for smishing
purposes to other malware developers. As we will see, that was not the only family
distributed by Flubot.

October-November 2021: ‘Android Security Update’ campaign and
new big protocol changes [Flubot versions 4.9]

During October and most part of November, Flubot’s TAs didn’t bump the version number of
the malware and they didn’t do very important moves during that period of time.
At the beginning of October, we saw a campaign different from the previous DHL / Correos /
Fedex campaigns or the “VoiceMail” campaign. This time, TAs started to distribute Flubot as
a fake security update for Android.
17/30

It seems this new distribution campaign wasn’t working as expected, since TAs kept using
the “VoiceMail” distribution campaign after a few days.
TAs were very quiet until late November, when they finally released new samples with
important changes in the protocol used to communicate with C2 servers. After bumping the
version numbers so quickly at the beginning, now TAs weren’t bumping the version number
even with a major change like this one.
This protocol change allowed the malware to communicate with the C2 servers without
starting a direct connection with them. Flubot used TXT DNS requests to common public
DNS servers (Google, CloudFlare and AliDNS). Then, those requests were forwarded to the
actual C2 servers (which implemented DNS servers) to get the TXT record response from
the servers and forward it to the malware. The stolen information from the infected device
was sent encrypting it using RC4 (in a very similar way to the used in the previous protocol
version) and encoding the encrypted bytes. This way, the encoded payload was used as a
subdomain of the DGA generated domain. The response from C2 servers was also
encrypted and encoded as the TXT record response to the TXT request, and it included the
commands to execute smishing tasks for distribution campaign or the web injections used to
steal credentials.

With this new protocol, Flubot was using DoH servers from well known companies such as
Google and CloudFlare to establish a tunnel of sorts with the C2 servers. With this
technique, detecting the malware via network traffic monitoring was very difficult, since the
malware wasn’t establishing connections with unknown or malicious servers directly. Also,
since it was using DoH, all the DNS requests were encrypted, so network traffic monitoring
couldn’t identify those malicious DNS requests.
This major change in the protocol with the C2 servers could also explain the low activity in
the previous months. Possibly developers were working on ways to improve the protocol as
well as the code of both malware and C2 servers backend.

18/30

December 2021: ‘Flash Player’ campaign and DGA changes [Flubot
versions 5.0-5.1]

Finally, in December the TAs decided to finally bump the version number to 5.0. This new
version brought a minor but interesting change: Flubot can now receive URLs in addition to
web injections HTML and JavaScript code. Before version 5.0, C2 servers would send the
web injection code, which was saved on the device for future use when the victim opened
one of the targeted applications in order to steal the credentials. Since version 5.0, C2
servers were sending URLs instead, so Flubot’s malware had to visit the URL and save the
HTML and JavaScript source code in memory for future use.

No more new versions or changes were observed until the end of December, when the TAs
wanted to say goodbye to the 2021 by releasing Flubot 5.1. The first samples of Flubot 5.1
were detected on December 31. As we will see in the following section, on January 2 Flubot
5.2 samples came out. Version 5.1 came out with some important changes on DGA. This
time, TAs introduced a big list of TLDs to generate new domains, while they also introduced
a new command used to receive a new DGA seed from the C2 servers –
UPDATE_ALT_SEED. Based on our research, this new command was never used, since all
the newly infected devices had to connect to the C2 servers using the domains generated
with the hard-coded seeds.
19/30

Besides the new changes and features added in December, TAs also introduced a new
campaign: “Flash Player”. This campaign was used alongside with “VoiceMail” campaign,
which still was the most used to distribute Flubot. In this new campaign, a text message was
sent to the victims from infected devices trying to make them install a “Flash Player”
application in order to watch a fake video in which the victim appeared. The following image
shows how simple the distribution website was, shown when the victim opens the link.

January 2022: Improvements in Smishing features and new ‘Direct
Reply’ features [Flubot versions 5.2-5.4]

At the very beginning of January new samples for the new version of Flubot were detected.
This time, version 5.2 introduced minor changes in which TAs added support for longer text
messages on smishing tasks. They stopped using the usual Android’s “sendTextMessage”

21/30

function and started to use “sendMultipartTextMessage” alongside “divideMessage” instead.
This allowed them to use longer messages, split into multiple messages.

A few days after new sample of version 5.2 was discovered, samples of version 5.3 were
detected. In this case, no new features were introduced. TAs removed some unused old
code. This version seemed like a version used to clean the code. Also, three days after the
first samples of Flubot 5.3 appeared, new samples of this version were detected with support
for campaigns in new countries: Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Thailand.

22/30

By the end of January, TAs released a new version: Flubot 5.4. This new version introduced
a new and interesting feature: Direct Reply. The malware was now capable to intercept the
notifications received in the infected device and automatically reply them with a configured
message received from the C2 servers.

23/30

To get the message that would be used to reply notifications, Flubot 5.4 introduces a new
request command called “GET_NOTIF_MSG”. As the following image shows, this request
command is used to get the message to finally be used when a new notification is received.

24/30

Even though this was an interesting new feature to improve the botnet’s distribution power, it
didn’t last too long. It was removed in the following version.
In the same month we detected Medusa, another Android banking malware, distributed in
some Flubot smishing tasks. This means that, one more time, Flubot botnet was being used
as a distribution botnet for distribution of another malware family. In August 2021 it was used
to distribute Teabot. Now, it has been used to distribute Medusa.
If we try to connect the dots, it could explain the new “Direct Reply” feature and the usage of
“multipart messages”. Those improvements could have been introduced due to suggestions
made by Medusa’s TAs in order to use Flubot botnet as distribution service.

February-March-April 2022: New cookie stealing features [Flubot
versions 5.5]

From late January – when we fist observed version 5.4 in the wild – to late February, almost
one month passed until a new version was released. We believe this case is similar to
previous periods of time, like August-November 2021, when TAs used that time to introduce
a big change in the protocol. This time, it seems TAs were quietly working on new Flubot 5.5,
which came with a very interesting feature: Cookie stealing.
The first thing we realized by looking at the new code was a little change when requesting
the list of targeted apps. This request must include the list of installed applications in the
infected device. As a result, the C2 server would provide the subset of apps which are
25/30

targeted. In this new version, “.new” was appended to the package names of installed apps
when doing the “GET_INJECTS_LIST” request.

At the beginning, the C2 servers were responding with URLs to fetch the web injections for
credentials stealing when using “.new” appended to the package’s name.
After some time, C2 servers started to respond with the official URL of the banks and cryptocurrency platforms, which seemed strange. After analysis of the code, we realized they also
introduced code to steal the cookies from the WebView used to show web injections – in this
case, the targeted entity’s website. Clicks and text changes in the different UI elements of the
website were also logged and sent to the C2 server, so TAs were not only stealing cookies:
they were also able to steal credentials via “keylogging”.
The cookies stealing code could receive an URL, the same way it could receive a URL to
fetch web injections, but this time visiting the URL it wasn’t receiving the web injection.
Instead, it was receiving a new URL (the official bank or service URL) to be loaded and to
steal the credentials from. In the following image, the response from a compromised website
used to download the web injections is shown. In this case, it was used to get the payload for
stealing GMail’s cookies (shown when the victim tries to open Android Email application).

After the victim logs in to the legitimate website, Flubot will receive and handle an event
when the website ends loading. At this time, it gets the cookies and sends them to the C2
server, as can be seen in the following image.

May 2022: MMS smishing and.. The End? [Flubot versions 5.6]

Once again, after one month without new versions in the wild, a new version of Flubot came
out at the beginning of May: Flubot 5.6. This is the last known Flubot version.
This new version came with a new interesting feature: MMS smishing tasks. With this new
feature, TAs were trying to bypass carriers detections, which were probably put in place after
more than a year of activity. A lot of users were infected and their devices where sending text
messages without their knowledge.
To introduce this new feature, TAs added new request’s commands:
– GET_MMS: used to get the phone number and the text message to send (similar to the
usual GET_SMS used before for smishing)
– MMS_RATE: used to get the time rate to make “GET_MMS” request and send the
message (similar to the usual SMS_RATE used before for smishing).

27/30

After this version got released on May 1st, the C2 servers stopped working on May 21st.
They were offline until May 25th, but they were still not working properly, since they were
replying with empty responses. Finally, on June 1st, Europol published on their website that
they took down the Flubot’s infrastructure with the cooperation of police from different
countries. Dutch Police was the one that took down the infrastructure. It probably happened
because Flubot C2 servers, at some point in 2022, changed the hosting services to a hosting
service in The Netherlands, making it easier to take down.
Does it mean this is the end of Flubot? Well, we can’t know for sure, but it seems police
wasn’t able to get the RSA private keys since they didn’t make the C2 servers send
commands to detect and remove the malware from the devices.
This means that the TAs should be able to bring Flubot back by just registering new domains

28/30

and setting up all the infrastructure in a “safer” country and hosting service. TAs could
recover their botnet, with less infected devices due to the offline time, but still with some
devices to continue sending smishing messages to infect new devices. It depends on the
TAs intentions, since it seems that the police hasn’t found them yet.

Conclusion
Flubot has been one of the most – if not the most – active banking malware family of the last
few years. Probably this was due to their powerful distribution strategy: smishing. This
malware has been using the infected devices to send text messages to the phone numbers
which were stolen from the victims smartphones. But this, in combination with fake parcel
shipping messages in a period of time in which everybody is used to buy things online has
made it an important threat.
As we have seen in this post, TAs have introduced new features very frequently, which made
Flubot even more dangerous and contagious. A significant part of the updates and new
features have been introduced to improve the distribution capabilities of the malware in
different countries, while others have been introduced to improve the credentials and
information stealing capabilities.
Some updates delivered major changes in the protocol, making it more difficult to detect via
network monitoring, with a DoH tunnel-based protocol which is really uncommon in the world
of Android Malware. It seems that TAs have even been interested on selling some kind of
“smishing distribution” service to other TAs, as we have seen with the association with
Teabot and Medusa.
After one year and a half, Dutch Police was able to take down the C2 servers after TAs
started using a Dutch hosting service. It seems to be the end of Flubot, at least for now.
TAs still can move the infrastructure back to a “safer” hosting and register new DGA domains
to recover their botnet. It’s too soon to determine that was the end of Flubot. Time will tell
what will happen with this Android malware family, which has been one of the most important
and interesting malware families in the last few years.
