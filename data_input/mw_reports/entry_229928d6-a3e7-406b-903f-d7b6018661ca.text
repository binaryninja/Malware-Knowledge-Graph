Indicators of Compromise Associated with
AvosLocker Ransomware
SUMMARY
AvosLocker is a Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) affiliate-based group that has targeted
victims across multiple critical infrastructure sectors in the United States including, but not
limited to, the Financial Services, Critical Manufacturing, and Government Facilities sectors.
AvosLocker claims to directly handle ransom negotiations, as well as the publishing and
hosting of exfiltrated victim data after their affiliates infect targets. As a result, AvosLocker
indicators of compromise (IOCs) vary between indicators specific to AvosLocker malware
and indicators specific to the individual affiliate responsible for the intrusion.

TECHNICAL DETAILS
AvosLocker ransomware encrypts files on a victim’s server and renames them with the
“.avos” extension. AvosLocker actors then place ransom notes on the victim server and
include a link to an AvosLocker .onion payment site (Figure 1). Depending upon the affiliate,
payments in Monero are preferred; however, they accept Bitcoin for a 10-25% premium. We
have also observed alleged AvosLocker representatives make phone calls to the victims to
direct them to the payment site to negotiate. Multiple victims have also reported that
AvosLocker negotiators have been willing to negotiate reduced ransom payments.
The AvosLocker leak site claims to have targeted victims in the United States, Syria, Saudi
Arabia, Germany, Spain, Belgium, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom,
Canada, China, and Taiwan. The leak site includes samples of stolen victim data and
threatens to sell the data to unspecified third parties, if a victim does not pay the ransom.
AvosLocker ransomware is a multi-threaded Windows executable written in C++ that runs as
a console application and shows a log of actions performed on victim systems. AvosLocker

ransomware samples contained optional command line arguments that could be supplied by
an attacker to enable/disable certain features.
Indicators of compromise specific to AvosLocker malware
Encryption and the ransom demand
AvosLocker ransomware creates a mutex object for use as an infection marker to avoid
infecting a system twice. Prior to encryption, the ransomware maps accessible drives and
enumerated files in directories. It then encrypts files while creating a ransom note named
"GET_YOUR_FILES_BACK.txt" in every directory.
In observed cases, encrypted files have the file extension “.avos”, “.avos2”, or “AvosLinux”.
Infected directories have a text file entitled “GET_YOUR_FILES_BACK.txt”. In some cases,
the text from the text file reproduces on the desktop wallpaper of infected servers. The
“GET_YOUR_FILES_BACK.txt” file directs victims to an onion site accessible via a TOR
browser, where the victim is prompted to enter an ID provided to them in the ransom note.

Attention!
Your systems have been encrypted, and your confidential documents were downloaded.
In order to restore your data, you must pay for the decryption key & application.
You may do so by visiting us at

Details such as pricing, how long before the price increases and such will be available to you once
you enter your ID presented to you below in this note in our website.
Contact us soon, because those who don't have their data leaked in our press release blog and
the price they'll have to pay will go up significantly.
The corporations whom don't pay or fail to respond in a swift manner have their data leaked in our
blog, accessible at http://avosqxh72b5ia23dl5fgwcpndkctuzqvh2iefk5imp3pi5gfhel5klad.onion

Indicators of compromise specific to the victim’s actions
Data published on the leak site
AvosLocker actors publish victim exfiltrated data on the AvosLocker public leak site if victims
do not negotiate or pay the ransom. The AvosLocker public leak site is separate from the site

AvosLocker directs victims to in the “GET_YOUR_FILES_BACK.txt” file. The public leak site
lists victims of AvosLocker, along with a sample of data allegedly stolen from the victim’s
network. The leak site gives visitors an opportunity to view a sample of victim data and to
purchase victim data.
Phone calls and DDOS attacks
In some cases, AvosLocker victims receive phone calls from an AvosLocker representative.
The caller encourages the victim to go to the onion site to negotiate and threatens to post
stolen data online. In some cases, AvosLocker actors will threaten and execute distributed
denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks during negotiations.
Indicators of compromise specific to the affiliate
Persistence mechanisms on victim systems include the modification of Windows Registry
'Run' keys and the use of scheduled tasks.

Cobalt Strike
Encoded PowerShell scripts (publicly available tool)
PuTTY Secure Copy client tool “pscp.exe”
Rclone
AnyDesk
Scanner

Vulnerabilities
Multiple victims have reported on premise Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities as the
likely intrusion vector.
Some victims pointed to specific vulnerabilities: including the Proxy Shell vulnerabilities
associated to CVE-2021-31207, CVE-2021-34523, and CVE-2021-34473, in addition to
CVE-2021-26855.
Intrusion vectors are likely dependent on the skillsets of the AvosLocker affiliate who
infiltrated the victim’s network.

MITIGATIONS


Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or
proprietary data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location
(i.e., hard drive, storage device, the cloud).

Implement network segmentation and maintain offline backups of data to ensure
limited interruption to the organization.
Regularly back up data, password protect backup copies offline. Ensure copies of
critical data are not accessible for modification or deletion from the system where the
data resides.
Install and regularly update antivirus software on all hosts, and enable real time
detection.
Install updates/patch operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as
updates/patches are released.
Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new or
unrecognized user accounts.
Audit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls with
least privilege in mind. Do not give all users administrative privileges.
Disable unused ports.
Consider adding an email banner to emails received from outside your organization.
Disable hyperlinks in received emails.
Use multifactor authentication where possible.
Use strong passwords and regularly change passwords to network systems and
accounts, implementing the shortest acceptable timeframe for password changes.
Avoid reusing passwords for multiple accounts.
Require administrator credentials to install software.
Only use secure networks and avoid using public Wi-Fi networks. Consider installing
and using a VPN.
Focus on cyber security awareness and training. Regularly provide users with training
on information security principles and techniques as well as overall emerging
cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities (i.e., ransomware and phishing scams).
