Chinese APT hackers launching a FakeNarrator malware to attack technology companies using
windows computers and implant modiﬁed version of open-source PcShare backdoor.
Threat actors loaded this open-source software in victims machine with the help of legitimate
NVIDIA application and also deploy the FakeNarrator screen reader application to replace the
Windows built-in Narrator, a free screen reader in Microsoft Windows nad bypass the Windows
“Easy access” feature.
The malware campaign mainly targeting the tech companies that located in south-east Asia
successful attack could allow attackers to gain complete control of the targetted system and take
the remote desktop access without any sort of credentials.
Attackers customize the Chinese based opensource backdoor PcShare for their operation and
used the backdoor as the main foothold on the victim’s machine.
They included various features in the backdoor including command-and-control (C&C) encryption
and proxy bypass functionality and they’re removed some of the unused functionality which they
feel not necessary for this campaign.

PcShare Backdoor Infection Process
Once the attacker gains access to the victim’s machine, they start deploying the post-exploitation
tools which have been developed with the help of publicly available source code that can be
accessed via the Chinese programming portal.

Chinese APT Hackers Attack Windows Users via FakeNarrator Malware

Threat actors use one of the post-exploitation tool called bespoke Trojan to abusing the Microsoft
Accessibility Features to gain SYSTEM-level access on the compromised machine.
Here the FakeNarrator comes into play, attacker Trojanize the Narrator executable to gain the
SYSTEM-level access and maintain the persistence.
According to cylance research ” The campaign is characterized by a fair level of stealthiness as
the threat actor made a concerted effort to avoid detection. The use of DLL side-loading
technique together with a bespoke loader utilizing memory injection ensures that the main
backdoor binary is never dropped to the disk.”

Loader overview
Also, the malware using an anti-sandbox technique to evade the detection by antivirus solutions
and protected its command and control server communication.
Researchers also ﬁnd the PcShare backdoor similarities with Tropic Trooper which is actively
targeting government institutions and heavy industry companies in Taiwan and the Philippines.
The backdoor is capable of performing some of following remote administration abilities:
List, create, rename, delete ﬁles and directories
List and kill processes
Edit registry keys and values
List and manipulate services
Enumerate and control windows
Execute binaries
Download additional ﬁles from the C&C or provided URL
Upload ﬁles to the C&C
Spawn command-line shell
Navigate to URLs
Display message boxes
Reboot or shut down the system

Chinese APT Hackers Attack Windows Users via FakeNarrator Malware

“Once the FakeNarrator is enabled at the logon screen via “Ease of Access”, the malware will be
executed by winlogon.exe with SYSTEM privileges. Typing the attacker’s deﬁned password will
allow the attacker to spawn any executable, also running under the SYSTEM account, at the
logon screen” Cylance researchers said.
Its leads to gain the persistence shell on the compromised windows machine without having the
valid credentials.
