By Shawn Xing, David Sancho, and Feike Hacquebord
Last March, we reported on Operation C­Major, an active information theft campaign that was able to
steal sensitive information from high profile targets in India. The campaign was able to steal large
amounts of data despite using relatively simple malware because it used clever social engineering tactics
against its targets. In this post, we will focus on the mobile part of their operation and discuss in detail
several Android and BlackBerry apps they are using. Based on our investigation, the actors behind
Operation C­Major were able to keep their Android malware on Google Play for months and they
advertised their apps on Facebook pages which have thousands of likes from high profile targets.
Link to StealthGenie
Several actors involved in Operation C­Major have been rather careless in the past, leaving behind
numerous digital traces on the Internet. One of these actors has been actively promoting StealthGenie, a
spying app for Android, BlackBerry, and iPhone. This app was marketed as a tool one can use to monitor
employees, spouses, and children. However, based on its functionalities, it is no different from malicious
applications. The Pakistani owner of StealthGenie got arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) in 2014 for selling spyware and was fined US$500,000.
For the C­Major actor, it was only a small step to go from promoting StealthGenie to using APT malware
that was designed to spy on the armed forces of a nation. In 2013, Operation C­Major used spying apps
for BlackBerry phones, which have similar functions to that of StealthGenie’s. It was apparent that these
apps were developed not for jealous spouses but for the threat actors’ intent on stealing sensitive
information from organizations like the armed forces.
More malicious apps
Since at least early 2013, actors behind Operation C­Major have been using a variety of malicious apps
against high­profile targets in the Indian military, as well as other foreign embassies. From our research,
we saw that these apps were downloaded by the hundreds, most likely by the targets in India. Some of
these apps, like fake news apps, are promoted on “official” Facebook pages, which is another social
engineering trick to lure users into downloading them. Most of these apps are developed by a Pakistani
company.
Here is a rundown of what they used during the operation and how each of them functions:
Ringster
This spyware collects the contact list of the targets and it can take screenshots of the targets’ phones. It

was available on Google Play in the first half of 2015 before it was removed.

Figure 1. Ringster appealing as a social messaging service provider
Our code analysis reveals that Ringster is reusing a lot of code from Wavecall, a communication tool
developed by a company called Yello. Ringster has a hardcoded URL pointing to mpjunkie[.]com. This
URL makes a clear connection to the other campaigns of Operation C­Major, which we described in our
previous post.
SmeshApp
SmeshApp is similar to Ringster but is more powerful. Smesh can steal SMS messages, record videos
and calls, and send screenshots. Smesh App was available on Google Play from June 2015 till March of
2016, and has been downloaded hundreds of times before it was pulled. This shows that Operation C­
Major used relatively basic malware that remained unnoticed on the Google Play store for a large time
window.

Androrat
Since at least 2015, Operation C­Major started to use Androrat, an off­the­shelf remote administration
tool for Android. C­Major may have bought Androrat from an Indonesian vendor. The C&C
infrastructure of the Androrat samples overlaps with the infrastructure that is used in other campaigns of
C­Major which we described in our previous blog post.
Indian Sena News and India Defense News Apps
Three fake news apps, Indian Sena News, Bharatiya Sena News and India Defense News (IDN) were
advertised on Facebook. Prior to being closed, the IDN news Facebook page had more than 1,200 likes
from Facebook members that have some relation to the India army. Likewise, the Bharatiya Sena News
page had 3,300 page likes. These apps are capable of stealing SMS, making videos, recording calls,
sending screenshots, and stealing files.

BlackBerry malware
It is no surprise that the actors behind C­Major also used BlackBerry malware in their operation.
BlackBerry in general has been used a lot by government agencies, probably including the Indian
military. As mentioned earlier, the sample we found is spyware for BlackBerry that has similar to
StealthGenie’s capabilities. It can exfiltrate GPS location, email address, emails, contacts, calendar data,
device identifiers, and user’s stored photos. The application also has the ability to intercept email, phone
calls, MMS, and SMS messages.
As far as we know, the BlackBerry malware was never available on BlackBerry World. Most likely social
engineering would be needed to get the malware installed on victims’ phones.
Conclusion
Though the C­Major operators don’t seem to have advanced skills, the damage they potentially have
caused is significant. Often their C&C servers live for more than a year and in some cases even several
years. They manage to keep malicious apps on Google Play for months and steal significant data from
high profile targets before the apps are flagged and removed. As we have previously noted, although C­

Major didn’t use advanced malware or exploits, there is no reason why they wouldn’t continue to develop
themselves to more skilled attackers in the future. With this in mind, we will follow their future activities
closely.
