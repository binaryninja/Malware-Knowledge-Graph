MEMORANDUM FOR MEMBERS OF THE ACQUISITION WORKFORCE
SUBJECT: Guidance on Cybersecurity Implementation in Acquisition Programs
Reference: "DoD Program Manager' s Guidebook for Integrating the Cybersecurity Risk
Management Framework (RMF) into the System Acquisition Lifecycle,"
Version 1.0, MAY-26-2015
A vital aspect of maintaining U.S. technological superiority and military readiness is
ensuring cybersecurity of our information technology systems, weapon systems, and networks.
Program Managers must assume that the system they field, including their external interfaces,
will be under cyber attack. By implementing the practices in the referenced guidebook,
programs will be able to more effectively plan, design, develop, test, manufacture, and sustain
systems that are more resilient in the face of cyber warfare conducted by a capable adversary.
To be cost-effective, cybersecurity must be addressed early within acquisition and be
thoughtfully integrated with systems engineering, test and evaluation, and other acquisition
processes throughout the system lifecycle.
The referenced guidebook has been developed to aid acquisition Program Managers and
their teams in effectively applying the cybersecurity risk management framework (RMF) to
design, build, and test systems addressing cybersecurity capability requirements to operate in a
cyber-contested environment. The guidebook explains key concepts and activities for successful
implementation of RMF activities and aligns them with all phases of the Department of Defense
acquisition lifecycle, including development, operational testing, fielding, and sustainment. The
guidebook describes in detail the cybersecurity-related roles and responsibilities, as well as the
development and maturation of cybersecurity artifacts and activities. Information, such as
system security engineering guidance, sample language for consideration in requests for proposal
and contracts, and the cybersecurity risk assessment process, is also presented to assist Program
Managers.
The guidebook, https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=721696&lang=en-US,
will be updated as lessons learned are identified to ensure that the cybersecurity guidance
remains timely, relevant, and actionable.

Executive Summary
Department of Defense (DoD) systems and networks are constantly under cyber attack. Nearly
all defense systems incorporate information technology (IT) in some form, and must be resilient
from cyber adversaries. This means that cybersecurity 1 applies to weapons systems and
platforms; Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and
Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems; and information systems and networks. Cybersecurity is a
critical priority for the DoD, and is a vital aspect of maintaining the United States’ technical
superiority. DoD recently revised several of its policies to more strongly emphasize the
integration of cybersecurity into its acquisition programs to ensure resilient systems. This
guidebook is intended to assist Program Managers (PM) in the efficient and cost effective
integration of cybersecurity into their systems, in accordance with the updated DoD policies.
The guidebook is based on the following DoD policies:
•

•
•

Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 8510.01, Risk Management Framework
(RMF) for DoD Information Technology (IT), March 12, 2014; cancels the previous DoD
Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) and institutes
a new, risk-based approach to cybersecurity.
DoDI 8500.01, Cybersecurity, March 14, 2014; establishes that cybersecurity must be
fully integrated into the system lifecycle.
DoDI 5000.02, Operation of the Defense Acquisition System, January 7, 2015; includes
regulatory cybersecurity requirements in the following Enclosures: 3 – Systems
Engineering (SE), 4 – Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E), 5 – Operational and
Live Fire Test and Evaluation (OT&E and LFT&E), and 11 - Requirements Applicable to
all Programs Containing IT; establishes that cybersecurity RMF steps and activities
should be initiated as early as possible and fully integrated into the DoD acquisition
process, including requirements management, systems engineering, and test and
evaluation.

Additionally, the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) Manual,
updated February 12, 2015, implements a robust cyber survivability requirement within the
mandatory system survivability Key Performance Parameter (KPP). This new requirement will
enhance system resilience in a cyber-contested environment or after exposure to cyber threats.
The risk management framework (RMF) brings a risk-based approach to the implementation of
cybersecurity. Transition to the RMF leverages existing acquisition and systems engineering
personnel, processes, and the artifacts developed as part of existing systems security engineering
(SSE) activities. Unlike a compliance-based checklist approach, the RMF supports integration of
cybersecurity in the systems design process, resulting in a more trustworthy system that can
dependably operate in the face of a capable cyber adversary. This guidebook emphasizes
integrating cybersecurity activities into existing processes including requirements, SSE, program
protection planning, trusted systems and networks analysis, developmental and operational test
and evaluation, financial management and cost estimating, and sustainment and disposal.
1

The revised policies and this guidebook reflect the Department’s decision to adopt the term cybersecurity in place
of information assurance.

iii

This guidebook is based on a set of key tenets that form the basis for the guidance that follows.
The following tenets are not exhaustive, but do outline some of the more important concepts and
principles that should be followed to successfully implement the RMF process into acquisition
systems:
•
•
•

•
•
•
•

•

Cybersecurity is risk-based, mission-driven, and addressed early and continually.
Cybersecurity requirements are treated like other system requirements.
System security architecture and data flows are developed early, and are continuously
updated throughout the system lifecycle as the system and environment (including
threats) change, to maintain the desired security posture based on risk assessments and
mitigations.
Cybersecurity is implemented to increase a system’s capability to protect, detect, react,
and restore, even when under attack from an adversary.
A modular, open systems approach is used to implement system and security
architectures that support the rapid evolution of countermeasures to emerging threats and
vulnerabilities.
Cybersecurity risk assessments are conducted early and often, and integrated with other
risk management activities.
As the system matures and security controls are selected, implemented, assessed, and
monitored, the PM collaborates with the authorizing official (AO), the individual
responsible for ensuring the cybersecurity risk posture of the system is managed and
maintained during operations, to ensure the continued alignment of cybersecurity in the
technical baselines, system security architecture, data flows, and design.
Reciprocity is used where possible through sharing and reuse of test and evaluation
products i.e., “test once and use by all.”

Introduction

1.1 Purpose
The goal of this Program Manager’s Guidebook for Integrating the Cybersecurity Risk
Management Framework (RMF) into the System Acquisition Lifecycle document is to help
program managers (PM) understand how to integrate cybersecurity into their programs
throughout the system lifecycle in accordance with the Risk Management Framework (RMF) and
through collaboration with their Authorizing Official (AO), the individual responsible for
ensuring the cybersecurity risk posture of the system is managed and maintained during
operations. Per DoDI 5000.02 and DoDI 8500.01, building cybersecurity into the system early
and throughout the lifecycle is required to enable operational and technical cybersecurity risks to
be identified and sufficiently mitigated throughout the acquisition process leading to decreased
program costs, shortened schedules, and improved system performance, resilience, and
trustworthiness.
PMs need to be aware of steps they can take to identify, evaluate, and affordably address
cybersecurity vulnerabilities based on risk throughout the system lifecycle. Doing so will ensure
systems are adequately and affordably protected against external and internal threats and can
maintain their mission capabilities in a cyber-contested operational environment. This
guidebook synthesizes applicable Department of Defense (DoD) policies with Federal guidance
for PMs to apply within their programs. Cybersecurity management support is typically
provided to PMs from their Program Executive Office (PEO) staff. Other external personnel
with cybersecurity responsibilities are assigned by the Service/Agency in which the PM resides.
This guidebook describes an approach to integrate key cybersecurity activities during all phases
of the system lifecycle, including the definition, design, development, assessment, deployment,
operation, maintenance, and disposal of the system. These activities include identifying,
assessing, monitoring, and mitigating cybersecurity risks to an acceptable level for systems and
the missions they support. PMs need to ensure cybersecurity risks are actively managed
consistent with system performance requirements, and are acceptable to the Service-designated
AOs, who provide the system Authorization to Operate (ATO). Close coordination between the
PM and AO is critical to the management of cybersecurity risks throughout the entire acquisition
process. The failure to do so early in the system lifecycle impacts the AO’s authorization
decision as well as system performance, and program cost and schedule. Without the ATO, a
system cannot be operated. PMs should work with their AO to discuss the impact of trade
decisions and to reach agreement on the tailored documentation required to support the AO’s
authorization decision.
The guidebook is organized to provide PMs an understanding of the changes that DoD has
implemented in policy to build robust cybersecurity into acquisition programs.

description of the RMF governance structure, and information for PMs on how to resolve
and escalate issues related to cybersecurity conflicts.
Section 3 describes a high-level process flow of building cybersecurity into programs
throughout the acquisition lifecycle.

Annex A examines each phase of the acquisition lifecycle, and highlights cybersecurity-related
activities and products in more detail than presented in Sections 2 and 3. Annex B describes
cybersecurity-related roles and responsibilities associated with the cybersecurity activities at
each phase in the lifecycle and provides a detailed matrix of typical cybersecurity activities and
the corresponding stakeholders that are responsible, accountable, supportive, consulted, and/or
informed for or by each activity.
Additional annexes provide detailed information for specific cybersecurity-related acquisition
considerations, including: engineering, test and evaluation, sustainment, the risk assessment
process, sample Request for Proposal (RFP) language for cybersecurity, training, resources, and
examples of RMF implementation.

1.2 Applicability
This guidebook is applicable to all acquisitions containing information technology (IT), 2
including programs at all stages in the lifecycle and all acquisition categories. The RMF applies
not only to information systems (e.g., computer networks/enclaves and major
applications/defense business systems (DBSs)) but to all IT, which includes information systems,
weapons systems, Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance
and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems, other platform IT (PIT) systems 3 and PIT (e.g., embedded
IT, test and diagnostic equipment, mission planning and support systems, and any other
information or IT that connects to or accesses weapons and C4ISR systems). There is no
difference in the application of the RMF to DBS information systems from non-DBS information
systems (e.g., National Security Systems). PIT systems must be secured and assessed and
authorized just like information systems under the RMF; however, PIT systems do not have to be
entered into the DoD IT Portfolio Repository (DITPR) and undergo Federal Information Security
Management Act (FISMA) compliance/oversight. Both information systems and PIT systems
must be registered at the DoD Component level. While DoD did not accredit PIT systems under
DIACAP, DoD now authorizes PIT systems (e.g., ships, missiles, airplanes, tanks/vehicles with
IT) in accordance with the RMF, due in large part to the interconnected nature of embedded IT in
these systems.
Program managers will structure, tailor, and phase their programs to best reflect their program’s
specific cybersecurity needs. Therefore, some of the acquisition processes and artifacts
discussed in the guidebook may not be required for every program or activity. The intent of this
guidebook is not to give a precise set of instructions on how to integrate cybersecurity for all
programs, but rather to help PMs and their staffs understand the policies, requirements,
constraints, and relationships to help them integrate cybersecurity within their own program
2

DoD instructions use the definition for IT from Committee on National Security Systems Instruction (CNSSI)
4009; that definition is included in Annex K.

activities and throughout the program lifecycle.
Detailed RMF and cybersecurity
implementation guidance for security practitioners is available on the RMF Knowledge Service
at https://rmfks.osd.mil, an online resource that serves as the definitive source for RMF
implementation guidance for DoD, a repository for templates and tools, and a collaboration
space for the RMF community.

1.3 Background
The DoD is increasingly reliant on information technology (IT) and its interconnections in major
weapons, C4ISR, facilities, and information systems. DoD systems that have significant
vulnerabilities threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (C-I-A) of critical
information and functionality supporting DoD missions, operations, assets, and personnel.
Skilled adversaries target DoD systems, networks, users, and interfaces, seeking opportunities to
obtain information and disrupt or alter operations. Building robust cybersecurity capabilities into
programs is vital to protecting the Department’s critical information, networks, and systems, and
to enabling mission success. To guide the integration of robust cybersecurity in the acquisition
process, the Department has developed and updated several key policies.
The Under Secretary of Defense (USD) for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (AT&L)
memorandum, January 7, 2015, accompanying the DoD Instruction (DoDI) 5000.02, Operation
of the Defense Acquisition System, states that successful defense acquisition depends on careful
thinking and sound professional judgments about the best acquisition strategy to use for a given
product. It emphasizes tailoring of program structures, content, and decision points to the
product being acquired and that programs must deal with the increasingly serious problem of
designing for, and managing, cybersecurity in programs. It states that DoD must do a better job
of protecting our systems and everything associated with them from cyber threats.
In March 2014, the DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO) published two important documents:
DoDI 8500.01, Cybersecurity, and DoDI 8510.01, Risk Management Framework (RMF) for
DoD Information Technology (IT). DoDI 8500.01 establishes that the term “cybersecurity” 4
replaces the term “information assurance” within the DoD. DoDI 8510.01 establishes that the
RMF replaces the DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process
(DIACAP) as the process to manage the lifecycle cybersecurity risk to DoD IT.
The RMF transitions DoD from a historically compliance-based process to a risk-based, fulllifecycle approach. DoD cybersecurity policy as implemented through the RMF process is based
on the application of security controls, the selection and implementation of which are based on
cybersecurity risk assessments and other SSE activities conducted throughout the system
lifecycle. A security control is “a safeguard or countermeasure prescribed for an information
system or an organization designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its
information and to meet a set of defined security requirements.” 5 Security capability
requirements are explicitly defined as part of the system survivability key performance parameter
(KPP) and other capability requirements document attributes and are derived as technical
requirements in system requirements documents and system and item specifications. PMs are

encouraged to tailor their cybersecurity approach according to system attributes and to base
trade-off design decisions on the System Survivability KPP, other KPPs, and derived
cybersecurity requirements of their systems.
The RMF enables the design and integration of cybersecurity early in the system development
lifecycle to assist in the development of a trustworthy system that can dependably operate in the
face of a capable cyber adversary. Security controls are integrated with system requirements
through SSE activities, including applying overlays to the baseline set of controls based on
system attributes, system/mission assurance security risk assessments and mitigations, and
design trades that factor in cybersecurity along with all other program cost/schedule/performance
constraints and risks. Cybersecurity requirements need to be matured and maintained throughout
the system lifecycle.
Figure 1 describes the six steps of the RMF process. The following sections describe PM
specific activities for implementing these steps and Annex M provides examples of RMF
implementation in the acquisition lifecycle.

PM Cybersecurity Basics

2.1 General Expectations for Program Managers
The PM ensures the program meets statutory, regulatory, and system requirements, balancing
lifecycle cost, schedule, system performance, risk, and system security. In doing so, PMs must
understand, plan for, and integrate cybersecurity into their programs in a cost-effective manner.
PMs need to tightly coordinate requirements generation, systems security engineering, ongoing
risk assessments, program protection planning, and test and evaluation. At the same time, PMs
need to understand the motivation of adversaries and the system vulnerabilities that may be
exploited to disrupt the operation of their systems and the missions their systems enable on the
battlefield. PMs must design, develop and produce DoD systems that will be dependable in the
face of a sophisticated cyber adversary.
2.1.1

Cybersecurity Basics

The PM is responsible for meeting cybersecurity requirements throughout the lifecycle of the
program. DoDI 8500.01, Cybersecurity, replaced the term information assurance with
cybersecurity and defines cybersecurity as:
“Prevention of damage to, protection of, and restoration of computers, electronic
communications systems, electronic communications services, wire communication, and
electronic communication, including information contained therein, to ensure its
availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and nonrepudiation”
PMs and Chief Engineers/Lead Systems Engineers who are unfamiliar with the details of the
DoD cybersecurity regulations and policies should consider the following three security
objectives when trying to balance specific cybersecurity requirements with the other
requirements that apply to their system:
•

•
•

Confidentiality – The property that information is not disclosed to system entities (users,
processes, devices) unless they have been authorized to access the information. NIST SP
800.53: Preserving authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure,
including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information.
Integrity – The property whereby an entity has not been modified in an unauthorized
manner. NIST SP 800-53: Guarding against improper information modification or
destruction, and includes ensuring information non-repudiation and authenticity.
Availability – The property of being accessible and useable upon demand by an
authorized entity. NIST 800-53: Ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of
information.

It is critical to understand that cybersecurity extends beyond the bounds of information security,
to include:
•
•

Solid engineering that includes design features that promote stability and security.
Training and awareness to provide users, operators, and sustainers with proper training to
ensure they are vigilant.

5

•

2.1.2

Response, recovery, and restoration to actively respond to internal and external malicious
attacks, as well as recover from system failures caused by inadvertent operator error,
internal and external malicious attack, and major calamities.
PM Cybersecurity Responsibilities

Early resourcing and planning is essential to ensure cybersecurity activities, which protect
against the full array of applicable external and internal threats, are adequately resourced,
executed, and assessed throughout the acquisition lifecycle. While the process assumes that the
program is following the guidance provided in DoDI 5000.02 and Defense Acquisition
Guidebook (DAG), that does not imply that every system is an acquisition category (ACAT)
program (e.g., deployed system in sustainment), or part of an ACAT program. For those systems
that are not required to comply with DoDI 5000.02, the Risk Management Framework artifacts
(Security Plan, Security Assessment Report (including risk assessment results or separate Risk
Assessment Report), and Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M)) serve as the reporting
templates for tracking cybersecurity compliance for the delivered capability. For cybersecurity
implementation into acquisition programs, the requirements and acquisition processes can be
divided into three sub-processes, each having specific documentation in which cybersecurity
should be clearly articulated. These three sub-processes are described in the following sections.
2.1.2.1 Requirements Generation
Requirements generation is described within the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development
System (JCIDS). Requirements generation includes the identification of required capabilities,
KPPs, key system attributes (KSAs), and additional performance attributes, which are included
in the Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), the Capability Development Document (CDD), the
Capability Production Document (CPD), the Concept of Operations (CONOPS), the Information
Support Plan (ISP), and the Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP). KPPs include the
cybersecurity element of the System Survivability KPP and other KPPs as required.
The PM team and requirements developers must be cognizant of the mandatory System
Survivability KPP, which includes cyber survivability requirements. The JCIDS Manual,
updated on February 12, 2015, requires development of cyber survivability requirements within
the System Survivability KPP, if applicable to the operational context. PMs will need to deliver
systems that are able to operate and complete their missions in a cyber-contested environment.
In practice, this KPP requirement will ensure sponsors devote resources to aid in the
development of rigorous cyber survivability analysis and ultimately KPP values, and to ensure
minimum cyber survivability-related requirements will be met.
2.1.2.2 Acquisition and Program Management
Acquisition and program management provides oversight of the key acquisition and program
management processes and documentation, to include, but not limited to: the Acquisition
Strategy (AS); Acquisition Program Baseline (APB); Cybersecurity Strategy; Program
Protection Plan (PPP); legacy System Threat Assessment Report (STAR) or other threat source
documentation (e.g. Validated Online Lifecycle Threat (VOLT)); Systems Engineering Plan
(SEP); Cost Analysis Requirements Descriptions (CARD) for Major Defense Acquisition
Programs (MDAPs) and Major Automated Information Systems (MAISs) only, and rationale for
lifecycle cost estimate for other programs; contracts; Requests for Proposal (RFP); Training
6

Plan; Life Cycle Sustainment Plan (LCSP); Independent Logistics Assessments (ILA) (for
weapon system MDAPs only); etc.
PMs must address cybersecurity in program reviews, including Deep Dives, In-Process Reviews,
and Overarching Integrated Product Team (OIPT) meetings, Defense Acquisition Executive
Summary (DAES) meetings, and Milestone and Decision Point Defense Acquisition
Boards/Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) reviews. The PM needs to build an IPT structure
that includes cybersecurity expertise. The Program Management Office (PMO) team should
work with external stakeholders 6 to build an effective cybersecurity capability. Cybersecurity
impacts system and mission performance. For this reason, the PM and acquisition leadership,
along with the resource sponsor/capability requirements validation authority, user representative,
and the systems engineering (SE) and test communities make cybersecurity trade-offs based on
risk and in concert with cost, performance, and schedule constraints. PMs must negotiate risk
trade-offs with relevant stakeholders, e.g., AO, Information System Security Manager (ISSM),
and others. The PM and AO are the key authorities for most cybersecurity decisions throughout
the acquisition lifecycle.
2.1.2.3 Systems Engineering and Test and Evaluation
Implementation of a disciplined systems engineering process that includes cybersecurity is
required from requirements analysis through design, test and evaluation, fielding, sustainment,
and decommissioning. The cybersecurity design is part of the system’s functional design and it
is captured in design documentation, such as the System Design Document (SDD)/System
Design Specification (SDS)/System Performance Specification (SPS)/System Requirements
Document (SRD) and other lower level technical specifications. Cybersecurity will be reviewed
along with all technical documentation during prescribed program technical design reviews
governed by the System Engineering Technical Review (SETR) processes.
As systems mature throughout implementation and assessment, the PM, in coordination with
ISSM and SSE personnel, needs to ensure the continued alignment of cybersecurity requirements
in the technical baselines, the system security architecture, information flows, design, and the
security controls. The PM needs to coordinate periodically with the AO to maintain awareness
of these activities as they affect the security state and risk posture of the system throughout the
Production and Deployment and Operations and Support phases. The PMO will develop and
implement a continuous monitoring plan to assure the effectiveness of security controls over
time, as changes are made to the system and within the operational environment, including the
evolving threat. Annex A, section A.4 describes the Production and Deployment and Operations
and Support acquisition lifecycle phases and provides more information on the monitoring of
security controls.
PMs also need to develop and maintain a PPP and a detailed Cybersecurity Strategy, and utilize
them as the program’s integrating and central point for cybersecurity. The PM must develop a
cybersecurity Test and Evaluation (T&E) strategy, allocate resources for cybersecurity T&E, and
ensure they are described in the TEMP. PMs need to consider and integrate cybersecurity,
including required resources, in the system’s acquisition lifecycle activities including systems
6

The roles and responsibilities of cybersecurity stakeholders are described in Annex B

7

security engineering risk assessments, SETRs, cybersecurity T&E, cost estimation, and artifacts
including the SEP, TEMP, and RFP.
2.1.3

ISSM Roles and Responsibilities in Support of the Program Manager

The PM is responsible for appointing an Information System Security Manager (ISSM) for each
assigned system with the support, authority, and resources to satisfy the responsibilities
established in DoDI 8510.01, Risk Management Framework (RMF) for DoD Information
Technology (IT). In accordance with DoDI 8500.01, Cybersecurity, the ISSM needs to be
assigned in writing. The PM should ensure that the designated ISSM has the support, authority,
and resources to satisfy the responsibilities established in DoDI 8500.01. Assignment of a
qualified ISSM is one of the most important steps and should be accomplished as early as
possible to ensure that applicable cybersecurity requirements are addressed in the system
architecture and detailed design.
DoD Directive 8570.01, Information Assurance Training, Certification, and Workforce
Management, current edition, provides guidance for the identification and categorization of
positions and certifications of personnel conducting cybersecurity functions within the DoD
workforce and should be used for selecting an ISSM. As the PM’s agent for ensuring
compliance with DoD cybersecurity policies and regulations, the ISSM’s roles and
responsibilities include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

•
•

Ensure compliance with cybersecurity requirements in accordance with DoD and DoD
Component cybersecurity and information assurance policies and guidance.
Support the PM in development of a POA&M and budget that addresses the
implementation of cybersecurity requirements throughout the lifecycle of the system.
Identify a cybersecurity team; the PM can designate the ISSM to chair a Cybersecurity
(may be called Information Assurance) Working-level Integrated Product Team (WIPT)
or sub-WIPT, executed under the authority of the Systems Engineering WIPT.
Support implementation of the RMF.
Maintain and report systems assessment and authorization status and issues in accordance
with DoD Component guidance.
Provide direction to the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) in accordance with
DoDI 8500.01.
Coordinate with the organization’s security manager to ensure issues affecting the
organization's overall security are addressed appropriately.
Continuously monitor the system or information environment for security-relevant events
and configuration changes that negatively affect security posture.
Periodically assesses the quality of security controls implementation against performance
indicators, such as: security incidents; feedback from external inspection agencies, e.g.,
Office of the Inspector General (OIG) DoD, Government Accountability Office (GAO);
exercises; and operational evaluations, including Director, OT&E cybersecurity
assessments.
Immediately report any significant change in the security posture of the system, and
recommended mitigations, to the Security Control Assessor (SCA) and AO.
Recommend to the SCA or AO a reassessment of any or all security controls at any time,
as appropriate.

Ensure that SSE processes are aligned to, and adequately documented in the program’s
SEP and PPP, and are executed with sufficient rigor to ensure required security controls
are implemented, resulting in the lowest level of residual risk to system operation.
Ensure that cybersecurity inputs to program acquisition documents are prepared.
Ensure that the program’s contractual documents, such as specifications, statements of
work, or Contract Data Requirements Lists (CDRLs) incorporate appropriate
cybersecurity language and requirements.
Support SETRs by ensuring that entry and exit criteria include cybersecurity and are
satisfied, and that design documentation meets the specified cybersecurity requirements.
Ensure that security controls and requirements are properly allocated and documented in
design specifications, technical publications and manuals, etc.
Ensure security controls and requirements are properly allocated and implemented in
logistics or program planning documents.
Ensure that security controls and requirements have been communicated and
appropriately resourced by program budget documents and are reflected in the program’s
requirements database.
Ensure that integrated logistics support documentation (e.g., LCSP) incorporate
cybersecurity considerations throughout the lifecycle of the system.
Cybersecurity Strategy Requirement

Under the Clinger-Cohen Act, a Cybersecurity Strategy is a statutory requirement for mission
critical or mission essential IT systems. Per Table 2, page 51, of DoDI 5000.02, the
Cybersecurity Strategy is a regulatory requirement for all acquisitions of systems containing IT,
including National Security Systems (NSS), PIT, and PIT systems. It is an iterative document
that reflects both the program’s long-term approach for, as well as its implementation of,
cybersecurity throughout the program lifecycle. The Cybersecurity Strategy should be used as a
tool for PMs, AOs, cybersecurity, and acquisition oversight authorities to plan for, document,
assess, mitigate, and manage risks as the program matures. The PM updates and maintains the
Cybersecurity Strategy and ensures it matures with the system design throughout the system
lifecycle. The Cybersecurity Strategy consolidates elements of various program initiatives and
activities relating to cybersecurity planning guidance and efforts. The reuse of existing analysis
and documentation is strongly encouraged where practical for the development of the
Cybersecurity Strategy to reduce duplication of content and effort. It is incumbent on the
submitting Program Management Office (PMO) to ensure that any such information is readily
available to the document review/approval chain by providing copies of any supporting
documents upon request, including acquisition baselines, systems engineering analyses, test and
evaluation, and RMF documentation.
The Cybersecurity Strategy is used by the AO, and reviewed and approved by the Cognizant
Chief Information Officer (CIO) prior to milestones and decisions points. For ACAT I
programs, the DoD CIO reviews and approves it. The Cybersecurity Strategy elaborates on the
approach and cybersecurity risks and countermeasures employed on the system. Additional
information, including the prescribed template and authoritative guidance can be found on the
Defense Acquisition Guidebook and the RMF Knowledge Service.

2.2 Functional Activities
2.2.1

Cybersecurity Requirements Analysis and Definition

DoD and DoD Component policy requires all programs to implement cybersecurity. All
programs should start with the baseline set of security controls based on the system
categorization. There are a number of factors that impact the selection of a system’s high-level
cybersecurity requirements:
•
•
•

•
•
•
•

Results of cybersecurity threat analysis for the system under development.
Potential impact values for the information types processed, stored, transmitted, or
protected by the system; and for the system as they relate to confidentiality, integrity, and
availability.
Functional decomposition and allocation of security controls delineated in National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-53, Security
and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations (also called
the security control catalog), to the system security architecture (also referred to as the
solution architecture) for the system, including all system access points and connections.
The mission the system is supporting.
System design features (KPPs, KSAs, and additional performance attributes) that
promote stability and security.
Operating environment (including threat) of the system under development.
Operational and procedural solutions that may mitigate threats to the system.

The government retains the responsibility and authority for identifying, selecting, and approving
the appropriate cybersecurity requirements for consideration in the system design; however,
industry expertise may be called upon to evaluate the many factors impacting the cybersecurity
design, and to make recommendations as to which cybersecurity requirements should be
incorporated into the design of the system. To ensure cybersecurity requirements are considered
in the functional design of the system, contracts, Statements of Work, and RFPs need to delineate
specific tasks and deliverables in support of cybersecurity. Once the high-level cybersecurity
capability requirements have been identified, they should be included in the Draft CDD, CDD,
and CPD. In parallel, the requirements should be captured in the program’s requirements
management database, e.g., Dynamic Object Oriented Requirements System (DOORS) that
permits development of a requirements traceability matrix (RTM).
2.2.2

Categorization by Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact Levels

The determination of system categorization impact levels for the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability security objectives is described in Committee on National Security Systems
Instruction (CNSSI) 1253, Security Categorization and Control Selection for National Security
Systems. System categorization by C-I-A replaced the use of Mission Assurance Category
(MAC) and Confidentiality Level (CL), used under DIACAP. The system categorization drives
the baseline set of security controls from CNSSI 1253. DoD uses CNSSI security control
baselines for all systems (NSSs and non-NSSs). There are three security objectives and each has
three possible values (Low, Moderate, or High). Refer to the RMF Knowledge Service at
https://rmfks.osd.mil for more information on security control baselines.

10

2.2.3

Functional Decomposition and Allocation of Cybersecurity Requirements

The security controls, KPPs, KSAs, and additional performance attributes, including
cybersecurity design features, will be functionally decomposed and allocated to various elements
within the system, consistent with system security architecture, e.g., the solution architecture.
Even if a cybersecurity requirement will be inherited from an enterprise system, it still needs to
be documented in the requirements database so that the program RTM accurately reflects the
cybersecurity requirements flow down from the system security architecture to the system under
development. The program RTM also needs to consider any access points and interconnections,
as interconnections to these mission planning and support systems/devices (e.g., test and
diagnostic equipment), may impose cybersecurity requirements on the system.
In addition to the elements normally found in the RTM, cybersecurity unique tracking elements
should be maintained within the RTM. These cybersecurity unique elements will support
development of RMF artifacts, if needed. It is important to note that the cybersecurity elements
in the RTM should not be treated as a separate set of requirements, but rather a subset of the
program’s RTM. The ISSM should exercise caution to ensure that the cybersecurity subset of
the RTM is always generated from the program’s RTM. Cybersecurity requirements should be
updated using a single, authoritative requirements database that is under strict configuration
management.
The program ISSM and SSE need to provide rationale for all cybersecurity requirements that
cannot be met or are identified as not applicable.
2.2.4

Design and Development

Systems engineers need to ensure that functional design considerations integrate cybersecurity
functional requirements and that these requirements are included throughout the development
process. The SETR process requires entrance and exit criteria for each design review.
Cybersecurity-specific criteria are a subset of the entrance and exit criteria. The design review
chairperson validates that the cybersecurity technical requirements are included in design
documentation and that all entrance and exit criteria, including the subset of entrance and exit
criteria for cybersecurity, are satisfied. System trades consider and prioritize cybersecurity
requirements against all other system design requirements. Technical requirements that cannot
be met, including cybersecurity requirements, should be assessed for the risk to the program, risk
to the performance of the system, and risk to the mission. Risk assessments should be conducted
and the results brought to the attention of the PM, Resource Sponsor (also called the Mission
Owner), and user representative.
Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) cybersecurity products and cybersecurity-enabled products
should be certified compliant with Committee on National Security Systems Policy 11, National
Policy Governing the Acquisition of Information Assurance (IA) and IA-Enabled Information
Technology Products, June 2013, as amended, by laboratories accredited under the National
Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) Common Criteria Evaluation and Validation Scheme
or National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Federal Information Processing
Standards (FIPS) Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP). Similarly, governmentoff-the-shelf (GOTS) cybersecurity products or cybersecurity-enabled products the system

11

employs should be evaluated by the National Security Agency (NSA) or in accordance with NSA
approved processes.
2.2.5

Configuration Management

Configuration management is critical to ensuring a successful system design and development
process. Controlling and documenting changes in design throughout the analysis, development,
and testing process requires strict adherence to an established configuration management
process. The configuration management process needs to include changes made to the
cybersecurity configuration and associated documentation. Failure to include cybersecurity
considerations in the configuration management and engineering change control processes could
adversely affect the program’s ability to integrate and maintain cybersecurity in the functional
design of the system.
2.2.6

Risk Assessment

PMs are responsible for managing risk in accordance with the mandatory requirements contained
in the DoDI 5000.02, Operation of the Defense Acquisition System, and are required to outline
their risk management strategy in accordance with the SEP Outline (2011).
Paragraph 6.d. of Enclosure 2 to DoDI 5000.02, discusses program risk: “The Program Manager
is responsible for implementing effective risk management and tracking to include the
identification of all known risks, key assumptions, probability of occurrence, consequences of
occurrence (in terms of cost, schedule, and performance) if not mitigated, analysis of mitigation
options, decisions about actions to mitigate risk, and execution of those actions.” DoD Risk
Management Guide for Defense Acquisition Programs, 7th Edition (Interim Release), December
2014, provides risk management guidance for PMs. The following paragraphs describe how a
program performs cybersecurity risk assessments for the system security architecture, including
all system access points and connections. The analysis of cybersecurity risks, in addition to
supporting the cybersecurity program, supports the program’s risk management process, and is
utilized in the SETRs.
Cybersecurity risk assessment is the process of identifying, analyzing, and assessing system
performance and mission consequences of cybersecurity risks. Assessing risk requires the
careful analysis of threat and vulnerability information to determine the extent to which
circumstances or events could adversely impact an organization and the likelihood that such
circumstances or events will occur. A risk model identifies risk factors. The risk factors of
concern are threat sources, threat events, likelihood, vulnerabilities predisposing conditions, and
impact.
The ISSM and SSE provide the subject matter expertise to plan and execute cybersecurity risk
assessment and structured testing that demonstrates satisfaction of cybersecurity requirements.
Per the RMF, selection/tailoring of security controls is a risk- and mission-based process to
inform requirements, architecture, design, implementation, integration, test and evaluation, and
sustainment. The selection, tailoring and implementation of security controls are enabled by the
Chief Engineer/Lead Systems Engineer, SSE, ISSM, and Mission Owner. The Program
Protection Trusted Systems and Networks (TSN) analysis or another mission-focused risk
assessment process consistent with NIST SP 800-30 (Information Security), Revision 1, Guide
12

for Conducting Risk Assessments, are resources available to guide the cybersecurity risk
assessments. These security risk functions will be executed using established methods,
procedures, and industry best practices. The ISSM and SSE need to communicate the status of
technical cybersecurity risk assessments to the PM as new risks are identified and old risks are
retired.
A more detailed discussion of technical cybersecurity risk assessment is provided in Annex F,
Cybersecurity Risk Assessment Process. Also see Annex C, sections C.5 and C.6, for more
information on trusted systems and networks analysis, cybersecurity engineering considerations,
criticality analysis, threat assessment, vulnerability assessment, risk assessment, and
countermeasure selection and application.
2.2.7

Threat Analysis

For cybersecurity, a "threat" is defined as a tool, technique, or methodology with the potential to
adversely impact organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation),
organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the nation through an information
system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of information, and/or
denial of service. A cybersecurity threat analysis results in a list of actors, tools, techniques, and
methodologies that can be used to target the system under development.
The intelligence analysts performing the cyber threat analysis do not necessarily reside within
the PM office; however, the work is performed on behalf of the PEO from relevant intelligence
sources. To apply the cyber threat analysis to a specific system, the engineer should start with a
defined list of threats that can be used to attack the system or the information being processed,
including methods, tools, and techniques and should add them to the threat information available
from authoritative sources such as the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), and National Threat
Operations Center (NTOC). Each threat should be evaluated for applicability to the system or
information being processed, i.e., the evaluation should consider whether the tool, technique, or
methodology can be used to attack and exploit system vulnerabilities or the information being
processed by the system and the likelihood of such an attack. The finalized list of applicable
threats should be included in the overall threat list for the system. The cybersecurity threats to
the system should be continually reviewed and updated throughout the lifecycle of the system.
This list of applicable threats and system vulnerabilities will be used to support cybersecurity
risk assessments as part of the RMF, and will inform mitigation activities.
2.2.8

Cybersecurity Validation, Test, and Evaluation

2.2.8.1 Cybersecurity Validation
In preparation for each technical review, the AO will direct a technical risk assessment of
cybersecurity, based on sound engineering judgment and incremental testing to validate
implementation of security controls, KPPs, KSAs, and additional performance attributes. Using
the completed cybersecurity risk assessment, the AO or the designated representative will
validate the cybersecurity design of the system and report those findings to the Milestone
Decision Authority, the PEO, and the PM.

13

2.2.8.2 Integrated, Incremental Cybersecurity Test and Evaluation
Implementation of the RMF does not fully ensure a program is prepared to operate in a contested
cyber environment – this can only be verified by testing and evaluation. Developmental T&E
includes assessment, verification, and validation of all security controls, including
Administrative and Management Controls, Technical Controls, and Operational and Procedural
Controls, as well as all performance parameters. Operational T&E determines the effectiveness,
suitability, and survivability of the system as a result of the design and security measures
implemented. There are a variety of test methods that include, but are not limited to:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Application of the automated tools/ Security Readiness Review Evaluation Scripts,
Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP), and static code checker/scanner.
Manual tools to include Defense Information Systems Agency’s (DISA) Security
Checklists and Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs).
Test tools utilized to test network appliances and related device.
Software endurance tests.
Hardware reliability tests.
Vulnerability scans and penetration tests.
Operational assessments with live adversary test teams.

Due to the high cost of system testing associated with laboratory use and field assets, it is
essential that cybersecurity testing be integrated into routine test objectives and test plans
flowing from the TEMP as early in development as possible. Cybersecurity operational and
technical requirements should be integrated into standard test objectives and test plans alongside
other KPPs, KSAs, and additional performance attributes, so as to leverage system time and
execute efficient tests that demonstrate the required performance of the functional design. For
programs that are on operational test and evaluation oversight, test plans will be reviewed and
approved by the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) for test adequacy,
including cybersecurity testing. DOT&E has provided specific procedures for OT&E of
cybersecurity which should be reviewed by the cognizant operational test agency prior to
conducting cybersecurity operational testing. 7
For more info on cybersecurity T&E, see Annex D, Cybersecurity Test and Evaluation
Considerations.
2.2.9

Test Plans and Reports

All cybersecurity requirements identified in the RTM need to be traceable through the
development process and validated during testing. This includes ensuring that cybersecurity
requirements defined in the RTM are traceable to the program’s incremental test plans. Early in
the test planning process, the ISSM should work with the T&E director to identify certification,
developmental test and evaluation (DT&E), and operational test and evaluation (OT&E) events
which will satisfy required cybersecurity test objectives in conjunction with scheduled testing.

7

DOT&E Memorandum: “Procedures for Operational Test and Evaluation of Cybersecurity in Acquisition
Programs”, dated August 1st, 2014

14

System test plans for routine testing will include cybersecurity test objectives and procedures to
ensure an integrated test approach. Detailed test procedures include, but are not limited to:
•
•
•
•

Cybersecurity requirements.
Test methodology and metrics.
Test procedures.
Test resources required.

In addition, reporting of cybersecurity tests should include:
•
•
•
•
•

Test results in terms of vulnerabilities identified.
Demonstrated/estimated operational effects.
Residual risk if no technical or procedural solution identified.
Potential risk mitigations (primary and alternate, if available).
Residual risk once technical or procedural solution is applied.

2.3 Risk and the RMF Governance Structure
As shown in Figure 2, the DoD RMF governance structure implements the three-tiered approach
to cybersecurity risk management described in NIST SP 800-39, synchronizes and integrates
RMF activities across all phases of the IT lifecycle, and spans logical and organizational entities.

TACTICAL RISK

Figure 2. Risk Management Framework Governance
Programs fulfil cybersecurity and system survivability requirements by implementing a tailored
set of security controls that are consistent with the risk tolerance of the system determined by
RMF authorities. The risk “frame” within the RMF is the set of assumptions, constraints, risk
15

tolerances, priorities, and trade-offs underpinning the risk management strategy. Risk tolerance
is the level of risk an organization is willing to accept in pursuit of strategic goals and objectives,
e.g., levels of risk, types of risk, and degree of risk uncertainty that are acceptable. Risk
tolerance drives many of the decisions throughout a system’s lifecycle, to include the risk
response, i.e., acceptance, avoidance, mitigation, or sharing/transfer. As we move from general
to specific through the three RMF tiers, from enterprise to mission/business processes to
individual systems, risk tolerance can be expressed in increasing detail.
At the enterprise level, RMF Tier 1, network AOs manage community risk to the Department of
Defense Information Networks (DoDIN) and all resident/connecting systems by issuing
authorizations to connect. A network AO’s risk tolerance is based on ensuring security controls
addressing community risk (e.g., intrusion detection, vulnerability management, and patch
management) function as intended. Network AOs also address mission risk by incorporating risk
tolerance of system AOs, information owners, and mission/business process owners. Both
network and system AOs typically have less risk tolerance for more critical information systems
than for less critical information systems. Note also that core cybersecurity capabilities should
be consistently provided and monitored across all systems over time. As such, it is desirable to
align risk tolerance and the enterprise continuous monitoring strategy. In developing that
strategy, security automation domains (reference NIST SP 800-137) may be prioritized, with
asset management, configuration management, vulnerability management, etc. tending to be
higher priorities. While all cybersecurity capabilities supported by the domains are necessary,
AOs generally have less risk tolerance for non-compliant security controls supporting higher
priority domains.
At the mission/business process level, RMF Tier 2, system AOs and PMs must coordinate with
the mission/business process owner/lead and other stakeholders to identify factors consistently
present across systems within the mission/business process. Based on the level of concern for
the factors, the risk tolerance for each mission/business process can be determined, documented,
and communicated to all concerned for consistency in system categorization, in selection and
implementation of security controls, and in authorization decisions to operate or interconnect
systems within and between mission/business processes.
At the system level, RMF Tier 3, risk tolerance may vary across systems in a mission/business
process. As such, AOs must work with program management offices, information system
owners, operating organizations, and mission owners to more clearly understand all variables
feeding into risk acceptance decisions for specific systems, so that they can express early in the
system’s lifecycle the system-specific risk tolerance, thereby driving programmatic decisions
about which security controls must be selected, implemented, and assessed before an
authorization decision will be issued.
For more information on the RMF governance tiers, see DoDI 8510.01, RMF for DoD IT, and
the RMF Knowledge Service at https://rmfks.osd.mil.

2.4 Resolving Conflict Arising from Cybersecurity Implementation
PMs must take action to resolve conflicts that may arise when implementing cybersecurity and
performing RMF processes, regardless of where the system is in the acquisition lifecycle.
Resolving issues early in the process can lead to significant cost and time savings throughout the
16

system lifecycle. Multiple stakeholders may have an interest and multiple coordination efforts
may be involved in the process of resolving a conflict.
Figure 3 shows high-level escalation and identifies senior RMF and cybersecurity stakeholders
who can assist in resolving cybersecurity conflicts at multiple levels. This chart does not imply a
direct chain of command. The acquisition process has a similar communication and governance
hierarchy, which is shown on the right hand side of the figure in smaller print.

Figure 3. Conflict Resolution
Escalation to the DoD Component CIO may be needed to resolve conflicts between multiple
AOs assigned by that CIO or between AOs where one is responsible for managing mission risk
(e.g., a “system” authorizing official who issues the Authorization to Operate (ATO)), and the
AO responsible for managing community risk (e.g., a “network” AO who issues an Approval to
Connect (ATC) to systems with valid ATOs). Escalation is most often contained within a DoD
Component; however, when multiple AOs span DoD Components, coordination may be required
with DoD-level entities charged with managing community risk (e.g., Defense Information
Assurance Security Accreditation Working Group (DSAWG), who issues ATCs), or managing
strategic/enterprise risk as the DoD’s highest level Risk Executive Function, (i.e., DoD
Information Security Risk Management Committee (ISRMC)).

Acquisition Lifecycle Cybersecurity Activities and Process Flow

The RMF process provides a method to develop and mature cybersecurity throughout the
acquisition lifecycle. Figure 4 illustrates the integration of cybersecurity requirements, the
development of the system and its cybersecurity capability, system testing, authorization, and
monitoring and maintaining the security state and risk posture. Details are described in sections
3.1 through 3.4.

Figure 4. Acquisition Lifecycle High-Level Cybersecurity Process Flow

18

3.1 Requirements
The requirements sponsor’s (also referred to as mission owner (MO)), and user representative’s
identification of the preferred alternative from the AoA process triggers many activities in the
Materiel Solution Analysis phase leading up to Milestone A (MS A). The system categorization
as defined in the RMF is one driver of cybersecurity requirements. Specifically, categorizing the
system requires the PMOs, Mission Owners and Information Owners to determine the potential
impact to the mission, due to loss or degradation of C-I-A, and capture this impact as distinct
values (low, moderate, high) for each information type within the system. Cyber survivability,
as articulated in the System Survivability KPP, other KPPs, KSAs, and additional performance
parameters are other drivers of cybersecurity requirements. The PM supports the requirements
sponsor’s and user representative’s definition of the cybersecurity requirements in the System
Survivability KPP by reviewing the draft Capability Development Document (CDD) for
technical feasibility and affordability. The results of the AoA process and the requirements
sponsor identification of the preferred alternative trigger an initial TSN analysis. Additionally,
the results help determine the initial baseline controls, derived from the final system
categorization, and any applicable overlays. Overlays can be considered as an initial “bulk
tailoring” activity, but system-specific tailoring of controls is required for all systems.
Initial high-level tailoring starts prior to MS A, but cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities
constantly change; therefore, tailoring must continue throughout the lifecycle. The PM achieves
this tailoring by:
•
•
•

Coordinating the initial security control set with the SCA, and preparing MS A system
and cybersecurity documentation.
Deriving technical requirements for the MS A draft system performance specification
based on the draft CDD, CONOPS, architectures and data flows, initial baseline controls
after overlays are applied, and other stakeholder requirements.
Providing cybersecurity input for the draft system performance specification, along with
the statement of work, CDRL, and source selection criteria, which are key sections of the
Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) RFP at MS A.

For more information, Annex H provides a comprehensive list of cybersecurity considerations in
the RFP.
After the AO approves the system’s IT determination, e.g., major application, PIT, PIT system,
and system categorization as documented in the Security Plan, the PM registers the system and
prepares for a MS A decision.

3.2 Development
System definition and initial system design starts after MS A. Systems, technology, and the
threat landscape change throughout design and development, which require additional tailoring
of controls. Starting from security control baselines, tailoring is based on increasingly robust
risk assessments that consider threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, and potential impact to the
mission. Testing, including the use of cyber ranges and blue teaming, starts in the TMRR phase.
The TEMP should include cybersecurity testing along with all other testing. During the TMRR
phase, when the PM has completed planning for development (i.e., Engineering and
19

Manufacturing Development (EMD)) and understands the risks, the PM releases the
development RFP. RFP release occurs at about the time the System Functional Review is
complete and there is an established functional baseline (e.g., system performance specification
is final/approved to support preliminary design and implementation of security controls) and the
requirements sponsor has validated the CDD. The PM must include cybersecurity language in
the development RFP after MDA signs Development RFP release acquisition decision
memorandum. The RFP language should identify the correct level of cybersecurity requirements
so that the materiel developer will sufficiently protect the information types stored in or used by
the system.
The EMD phase includes system development and selection and implementation of security
controls. During this phase, more tailoring of controls may be necessary to support detailed
design/technical decisions and/or as a response to the changing threat landscape and
vulnerabilities requiring risk mitigations. DT&E may be an iterative process; however, the PM
must coordinate the final test results with the SCA, AO, DT&E, and OT&E staffs at decision
points. The PM should begin drafting the RMF POA&M in response to vulnerabilities
documented in the SCA’s Security Assessment Report (SAR) and Risk Assessment Report
(RAR). The SAR, RAR, and RMF POA&M should leverage the DT&E and any operational
assessment results toward the later part of EMD in preparation for Milestone C decision. All of
these documents are made available to authorities to determine if the system is ready for final
testing.

3.3 Authorization
If it is necessary to test in an operational environment, or to use live data in a test environment,
the PM requests an interim authorization to test (IATT) from the AO. To obtain an IATT, PMs
and their ISSM must coordinate early and often with the SCA and the AO to determine which
artifacts are required and when. The further along a system is in its lifecycle, the more robust the
security controls are likely to be and, the more evidence (e.g., DT&E results) the SCA and AO
will expect from the PM to prove readiness for testing and to demonstrate the risk of testing is
acceptable. Refer to Annex D: Cybersecurity T&E Considerations for more information.
The RMF’s security control assessment must be performed by the SCA, but the SCA should
leverage results of DT&E to the maximum extent practical. The SCA captures the results of the
security controls assessment in the SAR. The SCA also performs a formal risk assessment of
non-compliant (or ineffective) security controls and captures the results in the RAR. The PM is
usually afforded the opportunity to correct weaknesses before the SCA finalizes the SAR and
RAR. The PM provides the approach to mitigate all remaining weaknesses in the RMF
POA&M. The AO can ultimately accept or reject proposed approaches, provide conditions, or
accept the risk.
At MS C, the PM assembles the system’s final security authorization package (Security Plan,
SAR, RAR, POA&M), as well as the continuous monitoring strategy and annual review
requirements, and submits them to the AO for an authorization decision.

20

3.4 Operations
If the authorizing official issues an ATO, documented in an Authorization Decision Document
(in the Enterprise Mission Assurance Support Service (eMASS)), the PM coordinates with the
OT&E staff for operational testing, then OT&E staff conduct IOT&E. Upon successful OT&E,
the PM may deploy the system in the operational environment. Deployment initiates system
monitoring in accordance with the approved continuous monitoring strategy and/or annual
review requirements, as approved by the AO in conjunction with the ATO.
Any change to a system has the potential to negatively impact the cybersecurity posture. In
some cases, the change may cause the AO to require re-authorization. The ISSM, in
coordination with the SCA, determines the security impact of any changes and if necessary,
updates the RMF documentation as required by the SCA and AO. The PM, if assigned lifecycle
manager responsibility, is ultimately responsible for maintaining the security posture.

21

Annex A - Cybersecurity Throughout the Acquisition Lifecycle
Lifecycles of system, product, or service acquisitions containing information technology (IT) can
be structured in many different ways, depending on risk and urgency of the need. Some
acquisitions will be tailored acquisition programs with acquisition category (ACAT) milestone
decision authority (MDA), and others will be acquisitions of services with different decision
authorities. MDAs and PMs will tailor and streamline program strategies, oversight, and
decision making for acquisition programs to fulfill the specific program needs. In cases of
urgent needs, formal milestone events may not be required, and acquisition processes may be
modified to expedite delivery.
Figure 5 below, Department of Defense (DoD) Acquisition Lifecycle, is a notional lifecycle
based upon DoDI 5000.02, Figure 3, Model 1: Hardware Intensive Program, depicting a highlevel view of the time phasing of acquisition and cybersecurity RMF artifacts.

Figure 5. DoD Acquisition Lifecycle
Each program may be structured in a unique way that may or may not include all the activities
within the typical acquisition lifecycle or may include additional activities. DoDI 5000.02
provides MDAs the latitude to tailor the lifecycle phases, milestones, and decision review points
22

and phase content based on specifics of the system, product, or service, as described by the
following from the DoDI:
“The structure of a DoD acquisition program and the procedures used should be
tailored as much as possible to the characteristics of the product being acquired,
and to the totality of circumstances associated with the program including
operational urgency and risk factors.
(a) MDAs will tailor program strategies and oversight, including program
information, acquisition phase content, the timing and scope of decision reviews
and decision levels, based on the specifics of the product being acquired,
including complexity, risk factors, and required timelines to satisfy validated
capability requirements.
(b) When there is a strong threat-based or operationally driven need to field a
capability solution in the shortest time, MDAs are authorized to implement
streamlined procedures designed to accelerate acquisition system responsiveness.
Statutory requirements will be complied with, unless waived in accordance with
relevant provisions.”

23

A.1 Materiel Solution Analysis (MSA) Phase
The DoDI 5000.02 states that the purpose of the Materiel Solution Analysis (MSA) phase of the
DoD acquisition program is to:
•
•
•

Conduct analysis needed to choose the concept for the acquisition program or system.
Begin to translate validated capability gaps into system-specific requirements.
Conduct planning to support a decision on the acquisition strategy for the product.

Figure 6 provides a visual overview of how cybersecurity is integrated into the MSA phase as a
foundational part of acquisition, with support from SSE8 and other functions. Annex G provides
additional information on acquisition program artifacts and acquisition-related roles and
responsibilities.
A.1.1 Cybersecurity Assessment Criteria for Analysis of Alternatives (AoA)
During the MSA phase, the DoD
Component conducts a series of analyses
and activities to choose the concept for the
capability that will be acquired, and begins
to translate validated capability gaps into
system-specific requirements and the draft
system
performance
specification.
Cybersecurity capability requirements are
integrated into the ICD prior to the MSA
phase with all other mission capability
requirements. Depending on the needs of
the system, the cybersecurity capability
requirements may be articulated as a KPP,
a KSA, or system attributes for the security
objectives of confidentiality, availability,
and integrity. If cybersecurity capability
requirements are not included in the ICD,
the level of cybersecurity for the alternative
materiel concept studied during the AoA
may not be evaluated, and a solution with
insufficient cybersecurity may be selected
and later designed and built. The Program
Management Office (PMO) should
establish a Cybersecurity Working-level
Integrated Product Team (WIPT) that will
develop
cybersecurity
technical
requirements and work with systems
engineering throughout the lifecycle;

Advocate Chief for more information, at (410) 854-4790

24

especially early on, before architecture and design decisions are made.
Enterprise architecture features should inform cybersecurity capability requirements in the ICD
(e.g., cyber resiliency). Adding cybersecurity into the solution architecture/design up-front is
more cost-effective than building it in later in the lifecycle after risk-based
cost/design/performance trades have been made. During the MSA phase, the cybersecurity risk
assessment focuses on potential mission impact due to the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and
availability, not the likelihood of a threat exploiting a system’s vulnerability. Ideally, the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact values (high, moderate, or low) are documented
in the ICD or equivalent document, are integrated into and considered throughout the execution
of the various analyses, and support the development and selection of a preferred alternative.
Top-level cybersecurity capability requirements are expressed in the system categorization.
Under the previous DIACAP information assurance process, the system categorization was
articulated as the MAC and CL. Under the RMF, the system categorization is portrayed as
impact levels for the security objectives of integrity, availability, and confidentiality. In some
cases in the past, this determination was subjectively made, not an objective decision based on an
assessment of potential loss of integrity, availability, and confidentiality on the system’s mission
as intended. Incorrectly establishing the system categorization often impairs the performance of
the system and ultimately increases the cost and resources needed to achieve its mission.
Reasons for this subjectivity were often due to 1) higher MAC and CL level programs having a
better success rate at securing funding in completion with other programs, and 2) justifying a
lower level that could be afforded based on the limited funding being allotted to the program.
The first case results in over-protecting the information and system. The second case results in
under-protecting the information and system. Neither case is desirable. The RMF provides an
objective approach to determining this level based on risk and impact on the mission due to loss
of integrity, availability, and confidentiality. NIST SP 800-60 - Guide for Mapping Types of
Information and Information Systems to Security Categories, can help the acquisition and
cybersecurity communities more objectively determine the level of required cybersecurity:
integrity, availability, and confidentiality. This initial cybersecurity level drives the initial
baseline of required security controls, as the starting point for tailoring throughout the system
lifecycle.
These cybersecurity risks are identified through cybersecurity risk assessments that occur
throughout the acquisition program lifecycle. The most appropriate risk assessment approach
during this phase is a qualitative model, as many of the system details necessary for a more
quantitative approach have not been defined or are not yet available. For example, the solution’s
technology is usually not yet selected at this point; therefore, the technical vulnerabilities cannot
be known. For similar reasons, the most appropriate analysis approach is the threat-oriented
approach or the asset/impact-oriented approach. Some of the studies and analyses that may have
potential cybersecurity implications are the affordability analysis, cost analysis, early systems
engineering analyses, threat projections, sustainment considerations, and market research. The
cybersecurity risk of materiel solution alternatives will be assessed during the AoA and
considered when selecting the preferred alternative.
SSE activities, including cybersecurity, need to be integrated into the program throughout the
acquisition lifecycle. Countermeasures associated with the other SSE specialties (e.g., software
25

assurance) mitigate cybersecurity as well as other system security risks to the program or system,
including the system’s development environment as well as the operational system’s critical
functionality and components and Critical Program Information (CPI). Because program
resources are limited, systems engineering trade-offs need to be made, and mitigations
implemented commensurate with the identified levels of system security risks. The program
manager should ensure that the AO is involved in the review of the acquisition documentation
that includes cybersecurity requirements related to security controls (e.g., statements of work and
system requirements documents in RFPs and specifications), and that the AO (or their designated
representative) participates in systems engineering trade-offs, milestone reviews, and decision
reviews.
The PM works with the requirements sponsor 9 and user representative to understand the
cybersecurity aspects of the operational mission, capability gaps, and the preliminary Concept of
Operations (CONOPS) based on the validated ICD. This operational information will help the
PM understand the true capability requirements and better develop a solution with the level of
cybersecurity necessary to meet those requirements. The system specifications and ultimate
success and validation of the program are based on tracing up to and meeting these user
cybersecurity capability needs. (See Figure 7)
If required by the AoA Study Guidance and Plan, the impact values for C-I-A, and any other
cybersecurity capability requirements in the validated ICD serve as the basis for the assessment
of cybersecurity in the AoA. During the AoA, the PMO may be asked to support the assessment
of cybersecurity risks based on the physical and operational environment of each potential
materiel solution alternative and specific-system characteristics.
A.1.2 Develop Initial Cybersecurity Strategy and Include Cybersecurity in MS A
Documentation
After the AoA is complete, the impact values for confidentiality, integrity, and availability are
analyzed for any changes based on the preferred alternative and documented in the draft CDD to
baseline the initial cybersecurity requirements and form the initial security controls baseline. 10 If
a security control overlay exists for a capability the program intends to implement, the overlay
should be applied after the AoA is complete. 11 Overlays are bulk tailoring developed and agreed
to in advance based on an assessment of risk for a particular type of information, system
function, or operating environment. Overlays provide the justification for security control
specifications that can be leveraged to expedite or ease the burden of system-specific tailoring.
Overlays are applied to the security control baseline resulting from security categorization to
form the initial security control set, which should be documented in an initial Security Plan. 12
9

Sometimes referred to as Mission Owner or Program Sponsor
The system technical initial security controls baseline traces to the preliminary system performance specification,
which is part of the preliminary functional baseline.
11
For example, if utilizing a Cross Domain Solution (CDS), the program should utilize the CDS Overlay when
selecting the security controls for the system. DoDI 8500.01 and CJCSI 6211.02 may require additional activities
for Information Systems implementing a CDS.
12
The Information System Security Manager (ISSM), with assistance from the PM, information owner,
requirements sponsor, user representative, and SSE, develops the initial Security Plan that is approved by the
authorizing official.
10

26

This initial security control set is the starting point for system-specific tailoring. 13 Systemspecific tailoring of the initial security control set requires a risk assessment to determine if
threats may exploit vulnerabilities; therefore, it informs which controls must remain in or be
added to the initial security controls baseline to mitigate the identified risks. 14 Special security
considerations, including cross domain solutions (CDS) and communications security
(COMSEC)-related requirements, should also be addressed through the tailoring process.
An initial cybersecurity risk assessment reveals which controls are deemed “not applicable” and
are documented in the Security Plan with a supporting rationale to show that no relevant threats
are projected to be able to exploit known or projected vulnerabilities. As technology choices are
solidified and more is known about the related vulnerabilities, the risk analysis can move from a
threat-oriented approach to a vulnerability-oriented approach. The Security Plan is an RMF
artifact providing an overview of the cybersecurity capability requirements and the technical
requirements for the system, and describes the planned security controls to meet those
requirements.
Aligning the system solution conceptual architecture/design with applicable enterprise
cybersecurity architectures will allow any common enterprise cybersecurity capabilities to be
inherited, eliminating the need to develop and implement a system-unique cybersecurity
capability and reducing DoD enterprise cybersecurity risk and system cost. The PM performs
requirements analysis and cybersecurity risk assessments, with input from the Sponsor and AO,
to develop mitigations to determine the most cost-effective and affordable preferred alternative
that satisfies the functional capability requirements. Once the preferred alternative is selected, it
becomes the basis for the cybersecurity requirements and specifications for the system that will
be developed, built, and deployed.
The Cybersecurity Strategy 15 is developed and iteratively updated and refined to reflect both the
program’s long-term approach for, as well as its implementation of, cybersecurity throughout the
program lifecycle. It also describes the program’s approach for completing cybersecurity risk
assessments (including current and projected threats and vulnerabilities), which should support
requirements analyses, trade-offs, and mitigations throughout the lifecycle of the program. The
Cybersecurity Strategy is approved and appended to the Program Protection Plan (PPP). The
acquisition and cybersecurity communities coordinate early and throughout the lifecycle on the
level of cybersecurity included in the system architecture/design, and ensure this information is
reflected in the Cybersecurity Strategy. This coordination will ensure that the official assessing
cybersecurity risk of the design prior to testing and deployment understands and can
communicate the risks to the system introduced by design trades that affect cybersecurity. This
coordination will help to ensure cybersecurity risks are acceptably addressed and will allow for a
timely authorization to operate (ATO).
13

The more the system’s characteristics and the assumptions about its operating environment deviate from the
assumptions stated in Committee on National Security Systems Instruction (CNSSI) No. 1253, the more likely it is
that the security controls need to be tailored. This is because the CNSSI No. 1253 baselines were built against the
stated assumptions (i.e., assumed a typical information system).
14
If a specific risk model exists for the capability the program intends to implement, that risk model should be used
when performing the risk assessment.
15
The Cybersecurity Strategy was previously called the Acquisition IA Strategy.

27

A system-level Continuous Monitoring strategy is initially developed while defining
cybersecurity requirements and selecting and tailoring the corresponding security controls during
MS A. The strategy defines how security controls will be monitored over time for effectiveness.
If controls were selected that cannot be monitored, the PMO is advised to select equally
effective, but different or compensating controls that can be monitored. To ensure integration
and alignment with enterprise efforts, the system-level strategy aligns with the DoD Component
and DoD-level continuous monitoring strategies. The system-level strategy ensures the
capability is built-in during the lifecycle phases for cost-effective cybersecurity situational
awareness, and to protect the information and system, detect threats, react to incidents, and
restore system capability. The strategy discusses how to monitor security controls employed
within or inherited by the system, and how to monitor proposed or actual changes to the system
and its environment of operation. The strategy includes the plan for annual assessments of a
subset of implemented security controls, and the level of independence required of the assessor.
The breadth, depth, and rigor of these annual assessments reflect the system categorization and
threats to the system.
The AO 16 (or designee) reviews and approves the Security Plan and system-level continuous
monitoring strategy. By approving the Security Plan, the AO agrees to the system
categorization, the set of security controls proposed to meet the cybersecurity requirements for
the system (and thereby mitigate risk), and the adequacy of the system-level continuous
monitoring strategy. The approval of the Security Plan also establishes the level of effort
required to complete the remaining steps in the RMF and provides the basis of the system
cybersecurity for the acquisition of the system, subsystems, and components.
To understand the cyber threats applicable to the program and ensure the planned security
controls and protection mitigations address these threats, the PMO works with the DIA or the
Component Intelligence entity to solicit future threat sources to support development of systems
that are secure against likely threats that the system will face during acquisition and when
deployed and operational. Adversary threat capabilities against the system are captured in the
System Threat Assessment Report (STAR) or equivalent document. Use of current threat
sources supports ongoing cybersecurity risk assessments and vulnerability assessments to ensure
the system retains the required level of cybersecurity.
PEOs/PMs should engage their supporting intelligence representative and/or agency early in the
acquisition lifecycle to determine their intelligence requirements IAW DoDI 5200.39, Critical
Program Information (CPI) Identification and Protection within the Research, Development,
Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E); and DoDI 8500.01, Cybersecurity.
To address the affordability of the planned cybersecurity protections, the PM ensures
cybersecurity cost estimates are included in the CARD or equivalent information supporting cost
estimation for the program.
SSE and program protection and cybersecurity planning inform the PPP, Cybersecurity Strategy,
and other MS A program planning and cost documentation, the draft CDD, and the draft TMRR

RFP. All of the MS A documentation and the Security Plan incorporate risk-based, missiondriven cybersecurity considerations and remain aligned throughout the acquisition lifecycle. As
cybersecurity technical requirements are derived, decomposed, and allocated to the system
architecture and design at various levels of abstraction, it is essential to document and maintain
traceability of the technical requirements to the security controls (see Figure 7).

Figure 7. Relating Capabilities/Requirements/Specifications and Security Controls
Annex B provides a matrix illustrating roles and responsibilities (responsible, accountable,
supportive, consulted, and informed) of the various stakeholders throughout the acquisition
lifecycle. Annex G lists the required products per milestone or decision point with associated
approval authorities and responsibilities. Products can be tailored as applicable to meet the
unique needs of a program.
The RMF artifacts (e.g., Security Plan, Security Assessment Plan, Security Assessment Report
[SAR], Plan of Action and Milestones [POA&M]) should be developed by or in concert with the
acquisition community and PMs may choose to stand up IPTs to support such efforts. This
planning helps the PM transition to the TMRR phase and begin system requirements analysis and
initial system design with good initial cybersecurity capability requirements and initial security
controls baseline to flow down and further tailor based on cybersecurity risk assessments. The
PM should open the lines of communication with the Component CIO community, the AO, the
requirements sponsor, and the user/operational community early in the lifecycle to promote

29

coordination and cooperation among offices, ensuring the stakeholders effectively design
cybersecurity into the system.

30

A.2 Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) Phase
In the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction (TMRR) phase, depicted in Figure 8,
activities include competitive sourcing, technology development demonstrations, and additional
design and requirements trades. The PM achieves cybersecurity risk reduction through a series
of activities that help ensure an affordable product, and executable development, production, and
sustainment programs.
A.2.1 Include Cybersecurity in System Design and Development RFP Release Decision
Documentation
At the beginning of the TMRR phase,
the PMO applies a systems engineering
approach to elicit, analyze, and
decompose capability requirements into
technical solution requirements and
specifications. This provides the basis of
the technical design and includes
cybersecurity requirements. The PM
coordinates with the requirements
community
to
understand
the
cybersecurity requirements and provides
feedback on the draft CDD. CDD
validation is performed later in the
TMRR phase.
As the systems engineering process is
applied, the set of security controls
continues to be tailored 17 to address
system-specific cybersecurity risk and
performance considerations. 18 Tailoring
supports the development of the system
performance
specification,
item
performance
specifications,
and
preliminary design. The tailored set of
security controls is documented in the
Security Plan.
After the Security Plan is developed and
refined, the PM determines whether the
program is ready to start system-level

Figure 8. TMRR Phase of DoD Acquisition
Lifecycle

17

Annex C provides more detail about the SSE process and controls tailoring.
The more details that become known about the system’s IT, the more the analytic approach can move from a
threat-oriented approach to a vulnerability-oriented approach. The risk assessment approach can also become more
quantitative than qualitative.

31

design through a System Requirements Review (SRR). This review produces a solid
understanding of the top-level system requirements that supports further requirements analyses,
technical design, and technology and cybersecurity risk reduction activities.
Requirements definition provides input to the program’s plans for T&E. T&E planning takes
into account cybersecurity requirements and security control assessments and is performed in
collaboration with the SCA, who is responsible for the development of the Security Assessment
Plan. The advantages of this collaboration include achieving a broader, more holistic view of the
program’s T&E effort, thereby promoting reciprocity for testing activities, and gaining a better
understanding of the schedule and resource requirements.
Cybersecurity requirements are included in system performance requirements, and as such they
should be clearly articulated in the functional baseline. The System Functional Review (SFR)
determines if the system’s functional baseline fully captures the necessary performance
requirements and functions, and whether the program is ready to begin preliminary design with
an acceptable degree of risk. When reviewing the system performance and functionality, the
PMO ensures appropriate cybersecurity requirements are included and the system’s ability to
withstand cyber threats is integrated and balanced with other performance requirements
comprising an efficient and effective operational system.
The requirements sponsor will validate the CDD (or equivalent requirements document) for the
program. This validation will precede the Development RFP Release Decision Point and provide
a basis for preliminary design activities and the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) occurring
prior to MS B.
In preparation for the Development RFP Release Decision Point, documentation is updated in
coordination with and informed by available cybersecurity artifacts, including the Cybersecurity
Strategy, Security Plan, and Security Assessment Plan.
At the Development RFP Release Decision Point, the PM summarizes TMRR phase progress
and results, and reviews the Acquisition Strategy for the Engineering and Manufacturing
Development (EMD) phase.
The Acquisition Strategy includes specific cybersecurity
considerations that may impact the overall affordability of the system, the competition strategy
and incentive structure, engineering and supportability trades and their relationship to validated
capability requirements, the threat projections applicable to the system, risk management plans,
and the basis for the program schedule. These specific cybersecurity considerations are put in
the RFP language and built into the program.
A.2.2 Include Cybersecurity in Preliminary Design and Final MS B Documentation
A PDR is completed before MS B and prior to the contract award for EMD to reduce program
risks, including risks related to cybersecurity. An important part of the preparation for the PDR
is the definition of the allocated baseline. The allocated baseline describes the functional and
interface characteristics for all system elements, including cybersecurity, and the verification
required to achieve these specified characteristics. The functional and interface characteristics
are allocated and derived from the higher level architectures in the Information Support Plan
(ISP) as well as the ICD, draft CDD, and other products. From a cybersecurity perspective, this
32

activity ensures cybersecurity technical requirements are adequately addressed. T&E will
prepare and provide a preliminary DT&E assessment in support of the PDR just prior to MS B. 19
Upon completion of the Development RFP Release Decision and PDR, the PMO will turn its
attention to making final preparations for the MS B review and decision. It also commits the
required investment resources to the program. Most requirements for this milestone should be
satisfied at the Development RFP Release Decision Point; however, if any significant changes
have occurred, or if information not available at the Development RFP Release Decision Point
could impact this decision, it is provided at MS B. MS B requires final demonstration that risks,
including cybersecurity risks, have been adequately mitigated to support a commitment to design
for production. The RFP and the subsequent contract should define the process the government
will use to review and assess system performance (that includes cybersecurity). Cybersecurity is
part of the validated capability requirements; it must have full funding in the Future Years
Defense Program and comply with affordability goals for production and sustainment considered
at MS B.

19

For more information on the regulatory and statutory requirements for conducting and reporting on a PDR, see
Table 5 in Enclosure 1 of the DoDI 5000.02.

33

A.3 Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Phase
The purpose of the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase is to develop,
build, and test a product to verify that all operational and derived requirements have been met
and to support production and deployment decisions. The EMD phase is illustrated in Figure 9.
The PMO will complete the detailed designs for the product’s hardware and software,
systematically close any open risks, build and test prototypes to verify compliance with
requirements, and prepare for production and deployment.
A.3.1 Include Cybersecurity in
Detailed Final Design
Cybersecurity requirements are
mapped and allocated to the
hardware and software design for
the system as part of the overall
system development process. This
mapping is based on risk
assessments identifying which
threats may exploit vulnerabilities
in the chosen hardware and
software. 20
These technology
choices may bring unanticipated
risk, and additional security
controls may need to be allocated
to components to adequately
mitigate identified risk. The PMO
continues to coordinate with the
requirements/functional sponsors
as engineering and program trades
occur that might affect the
resulting cybersecurity capabilities
in the delivered system. 21
To start the process, the PMO
Figure 9. EMD Phase of DoD Acquisition Lifecycle
establishes coordination and
collaboration between SSE and developers. The objective is to ensure developers understand
relevant threats and development will be conducted in accordance with security controls related
to assurance, system development, and cybersecurity best practices to reduce vulnerabilities and
to design, build, and test cybersecurity in the system early and cost effectively. Systems
engineering completes the detailed build-to design of the system, ensuring cybersecurity
20

As more details about the system’s IT are known at this point, the risk assessment can move from qualitative to
semi-quantitative or quantitative. Also, the analytic approach can move from a threat-oriented approach to a
vulnerability-oriented approach.
21
In addition, the PMO coordinates with the appropriate authorizing officials to perform all assessment and
authorization activities necessary to obtain appropriate approvals and authorizations (such as an Interim Authority
To Test [IATT]) to conduct system testing activities.

34

requirements are met. This systems engineering includes technical planning as defined in the
approved Systems Engineering Plan (SEP) and verifies compliance with the functional,
allocated, and product baselines. The T&E and cybersecurity assessment communities align the
Security Assessment Plan with the T&E Master Plan to ensure integration of cybersecurity
assessments into DT&E. DT&E of system elements and the system (where feasible)
demonstrates system maturity and readiness to begin production and OT&E and/or deployment
and sustainment activities.
As part of the overall system development, the PM ensures cybersecurity requirements are
mapped and allocated to the hardware and software design. All software code development
should be assessed for secure coding practices and standards, 22 with an emphasis on compliance
with software development standards throughout the development process. The PMO tracks and
updates cybersecurity risk mitigation activities and refines the PPP. These mitigation activities
are based on Trusted Systems and Networks (TSN) analysis 23 and cybersecurity risk assessments
and inform the coordinated tailoring of controls and design trades. The results of these analyses
are documented in the Security Plan. Cybersecurity risk assessments can leverage TSN analyses,
which are included in program protection activities conducted throughout the acquisition
lifecycle, at systems engineering technical reviews and milestone reviews and decision points.
The PM also coordinates with stakeholders on T&E activities, the mitigation of exploitable
vulnerabilities discovered during DT&E, and evolving requirements.
T&E continues, based on the evolving requirements and preliminary and detailed design. The
T&E community, in collaboration with SSE, characterizes the attack surface 24 to assess
cybersecurity in component and system integration testing. This could be early contractor
testing, government DT&E, or a combination based on the program TEMP. 25
The PMO refines the PPP to reflect any changes to risks and countermeasures to mitigate them
and documents cybersecurity risks known to date, based on the most current threat and
vulnerability assessments. As part of the TSN analysis, the Threat Assessment includes
obtaining threat assessments from the DIA Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) Threat
Analysis Center (TAC) via the TSN focal point for suppliers of critical components. If new or
updated threat assessments reveal threats not accounted for in previous risk assessments, the risk
assessment is updated. If unacceptable risks are identified, security controls, countermeasures,
and/or requirements baselines may need to be updated to mitigate the risk to an acceptable level,
based on feedback from authorizing officials. The PMO reviews the program’s cybersecurity
engineering requirements to ensure they are executable within the existing budget. 26
All required cybersecurity features of the program are reflected in an updated CARD (or
equivalent document) based on the system technical baseline. The program schedulers update

analysts review the adequacy of cybersecurity processes and metrics to ensure they are in place
for the program to succeed in operation. The PMO reviews program staffing for cybersecurity
going forward to deployment and sustainment.
During this phase, a Critical Design Review (CDR) is conducted to assess the design maturity,
including cybersecurity, build-to or code-to documentation, and remaining risks, leading to the
establishment of the initial product baseline. The CDR is the decision point to assess and
confirm the adequacy of the system design to meet the system requirements, including
cybersecurity, and readiness to begin developmental prototype hardware fabrication and/or
software coding with acceptable risk. The PMO ensures CDR entrance criteria for cybersecurity
baseline design are met and all cybersecurity requirements are reflected in the product baseline,
which includes the design. In support of the CDR, DASD(DT&E) provides an assessment of
DT&E performed to date, including cybersecurity, for programs on the OSD DT&E oversight
list.
Decomposed component specifications, with inherent cybersecurity requirements, are fully
defined, including verification criteria, and traced to the security controls documented in the
Security Plan. The PM may be responsible for managing software development activities that
incorporate code reviews and architecture reviews against incremental builds to reduce
vulnerabilities in any custom software, including via automated scanning tools (e.g., static
analysis). Code and architecture reviews are informed by the TSN criticality, vulnerability,
threat, and risk analyses. The system’s security controls are assessed against the Security
Assessment Plan using appropriate procedures to determine the extent to which the controls are
effective, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the
cybersecurity requirements for the system. The assessment of the security controls is
documented in a SAR and provided to the testing community and the PMO to determine the
appropriate follow-up action (e.g., proposed risk response in the POA&M).
During the EMD phase, the PM should ensure that DoD-evaluated and certified/approved
products are employed. This step includes using hardware from the Defense Information
Systems Agency (DISA) Unified Capabilities (UC) Approved Products List (APL), and software
that has undergone National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) evaluation and has been
published on the Approved Products Compliance List (APCL). The Common Criteria
Evaluation and Validation Scheme (CCEVS) and the Unified Capabilities Requirements (UCR)
are intended to complement each other in scope and capability with minimal overlap.
The DISA-published DoD UC APL is a single consolidated list of products that have completed
interoperability and cybersecurity certification. Use of the DoD UC APL enables DoD services
and agencies to purchase and operate UC systems (primarily hardware) for connection to DoD
networks. Security assessment and authorization are streamlined for UC-approved products.
The APL is documented in the Approved Products List Integrated Tracking System, which is
updated regularly and available at https://aplits.disa.mil/processAPList.do. The UC APL
primarily includes network and communication-related services.
The CCEVS products address a broad spectrum of IT products, including operating systems,
database management systems, common applications, security products, and several
36

communication products. Because NIAP-compliant products are evaluated and published on a
NIAP-CCEVS APCL, security assessment and authorization is streamlined when compared to
using non-evaluated products. The vendors are required to ensure that their products are updated
and evaluated upon the release of updated versions and security patches. The NIAP CCEVS
program is a partnership between the U.S. government and industry.
A.3.2 Test Cybersecurity Requirements in a Cyber Threat Environment and Assess Cyber
Risk to Support Initial Deployment Decision
Following the CDR, the PM also coordinates with the authorizing official to obtain an
authorization decision (i.e., IATT) to assess the system within an operationally realistic
environment, prior to MS C, for inclusion in the DT&E assessment. To obtain an IATT (for
testing in an operational environment, or when using live data in a test environment), PMs
(leveraging their ISSM) must coordinate early and often with the SCA’s and the AO’s offices to
determine which artifacts are required and when. The intent is for all applicable security controls
to be tested and satisfied before testing in an operational environment or with live data except for
those that can only be tested in an operational environment. While most IATTs are issued
shortly before MS C, when development is nearly finalized, it is possible an IATT for the system
or its components is necessary earlier in the lifecycle. In this situation, not all security controls
may have been fully implemented or tested, thereby generating evidence of effectiveness;
therefore the risk of testing in an operational environment or with live data may not be fully
known. Regardless, all cybersecurity documentation (proving security control effectiveness and
conveying risk) that can be generated must be generated as early as possible and made available
to support the IATT decision. The farther along a system is in its lifecycle, the more robust the
security controls are likely to be and the more evidence (e.g., DT&E results) the SCA and AO
will expect from the PM to prove readiness for testing and to demonstrate the risk of testing is
acceptable. A Test Readiness Review is conducted to evaluate whether the product or system
under development is ready for further DT&E. During this phase of DT&E, the system should
undergo a vulnerability assessment, and the system’s implementation of cybersecurity
requirements should be evaluated in a mission context using realistic threat exploitation
techniques. This effort supports the formal validation of the CPD. Note: those systems under
DOT&E oversight will be required to conduct an Operational Assessment, which supports the
first limited fielding for acquisition. The PM implements and verifies cybersecurity-derived
requirements in the hardware and software design for transition to the development and
manufacturing environment. Prior to MS C, the PMO completes cybersecurity DT&E and a
Functional Configuration Audit/System Verification Review/Production Readiness Review.

37

A.4 Production and Deployment Phase and
Operations and Support Phase
The Production and Deployment (P&D) and
Operations and Support (O&S) phases mature the
initial product baseline through production/
deployment, operations, sustainment, and disposal.
The P&D and O&S phases consist of the following
program activities:
•
•
•
•

Initial production or limited deployment/
fielding
OT&E
Lifecycle sustainment
Disposal

Figure 10 illustrates which key artifacts are
required for integrating cybersecurity into the P&D
and O&S phases. Integration of the cybersecurity
RMF early and throughout the acquisition lifecycle
is essential to obtaining an authorization to operate
(ATO) decision in the P&D phase prior to initial
operational test and evaluation (IOT&E). The
initial security controls baseline is developed
during the MSA phase, and the set of security
controls is tailored throughout the acquisition
lifecycle. Verifying that security controls are
properly implemented prior to OT&E will reduce
cybersecurity vulnerabilities and avoid common
problems. 27

Figure 10. P&D O&S Phases of DoD
Acquisition Lifecycle

A.4.1 Production and Deployment: Operationally Test Cybersecurity to Support Full or
Final Deployment Decision
An ATO may be required prior to IOT&E, if the testing is conducted in the operational
environment or on deployed capabilities. In addition, the program must obtain interoperability
certification 28 and approval to connect 29 to the DoDIN.

27

From draft 2013 DOT&E annual report: over 400 cybersecurity vulnerabilities were uncovered during the
vulnerability assessment and/or the penetration testing that occurred during the operational test period. Of those,
approximately half were serious (Category 1) vulnerabilities that could allow debilitating compromise to a system,
and approximately three-quarters of the systems reviewed had one or more serious vulnerabilities. The three most
common Category 1 vulnerabilities were: (1) out-of-date/unpatched software, (2) configurations that included
known code vulnerabilities, and (3) the use of default passwords in fielded systems. All of the problem discoveries
could have and should have been identified prior to operational testing.

38

The AO may grant an ATO for up to 3 years, at which time the system must be reauthorized.
Reauthorization may also be required at any time during this three-year period, due to the results
of an annual review or a major change in the system’s cybersecurity posture (i.e., an increase in
risk). Risk assessments are necessary to determine if, and to what degree, the risk has increased
due to changes in the system, its environment, or its operation. If risk has increased, the
authorizing official must be consulted to determine if a new authorization decision is required.
There is an emerging DoD strategy for Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM).
Each DoD Component develops its respective ISCM implementation plan to align with the
overarching DoD ISCM strategy. Similarly, programs develop and align their respective systemlevel ISCM strategies with the Component and DoD-level guidance.
ISCM becomes an enabler of continuous reauthorization, in that the effectiveness of security
controls is automatically or manually monitored so that the authorizing official can be made
aware of any significant changes to the cybersecurity posture of the system in its operating
environment.
The system-level continuous monitoring strategy developed and refined throughout the lifecycle
is implemented in P&D. In accordance with this strategy, the system is monitored for
cybersecurity-relevant events and configuration changes, the quality of security control
implementation is periodically assessed, and significant changes in the system’s cybersecurity
posture are reported to the Security Control Assessor (SCA) and authorizing official.
The PM ensures the security plan and POA&M are updated based on the results of the systemlevel continuous monitoring process. The ISSM may recommend changes or improvements to
the implementation of assigned security controls, the assignment of additional security controls,
or changes or improvements to the design of the system itself to the SCA and AO at any time.
Continuous monitoring is performed at a system-level, but the information can be rolled up to
provide an enterprise view. Mission owners and operators participate in continuous monitoring
to ensure the effectiveness of security controls and in many cases provide input to PMs on the
more technical security controls (i.e., controls applied to or by the system itself). PMs may be
aware of and correct known system-level weaknesses, but computer network defense service
providers can also advise information system owners and PMs of broader-based attacks and can
offer evidence of and advice on exploitable vulnerabilities in the system that must be corrected
or mitigated to protect the individual system, other systems on the enterprise network, and the
enterprise network itself from exploitation.
IOT&E is conducted within a realistic threat environment based on the program’s STAR. The
PM coordinates with the designated Operational Test Agency (OTA) to ensure adequate
28

For guidance on interoperability testing and certification, see DoDI 8330.01, Interoperability of IT and NSS, 21
May 2014, and the current version of the Joint Interoperability Test Command Interoperability (JITC) Process Guide
(IPG).

be found at http://www.disa.mil/Services/Network-Services/Enterprise-Connections/Connection-Process-Guide.

39

cybersecurity activities are included in the operational test plans. Independent cybersecurity
teams perform vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to assess, protect, detect, react
to, and restore attributes of the system under test. A cybersecurity risk assessment is necessary
to determine if any identified vulnerabilities can be exploited.30 If any cybersecurity issues are
identified, alternative courses of remediation to resolve identified issues, problems, root cause of
failure, erroneous behavior, or other non-compliance issues are presented to the PM and
authorizing official.
The MDA assesses the results of initial OT&E, initial manufacturing, and initial deployment, and
determines whether or not to approve proceeding to Full-Rate Production or Full Deployment. If
new validated threats or vulnerabilities are identified, and a cybersecurity risk assessment
determines that they create deficiencies that may affect operational effectiveness, they will be
identified in the POA&M.
A successful Full Rate Production (FRP) decision review indicates the manufacturing processes
are mature and the capability has been successfully demonstrated through OT&E in a realistic
operational environment. The FRP decision review confirms that an updated TSN analysis has
been completed, an ATO has been granted, and the updated PPP has been submitted and
approved.
A.4.2 Operations and Support: Monitor Cybersecurity and Risk after Authorization to
Operate to Maintain Security Posture until Disposal
The purpose of the Operations and Support (O&S) phase is to execute the product support
strategy, satisfy materiel readiness and operational support performance requirements, and
sustain the system 31 over its lifecycle. O&S begins after the FRP or Full Deployment decision
and is based on an MDA-approved Lifecycle Support Plan (LCSP). 32
After the system is approved and fielded for operational use, the effectiveness of the program’s
cybersecurity capabilities is monitored in accordance with the system-level continuous
monitoring strategy. Any change to the system, its environment, or its use has the potential to
increase or decrease risk; therefore, a cybersecurity risk assessment is necessary to determine the
risk level associated with changes. 33 Results of continuous monitoring and subsequent
30

The most appropriate risk assessment approach depends on the level of detailed information provided by the
vulnerability assessment and/or the penetration test. More details allow a more quantitative approach. Also, the
most appropriate analytic approach at this point is a vulnerability-oriented approach, as the focus is on
vulnerabilities that may be exploited by threat sources, while also understanding the impact to operations.

31

The following are examples of O&S cybersecurity activities: implementing continuous monitoring; analyzing and
implementing Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts (IAVAs); applying patches as needed; maintaining and
updating anti-virus/Host Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) signatures; maintaining local site infrastructure,
facility, physical, and procedural cybersecurity requirements; and meeting reauthorization requirements.
32

Annex E provides more information on cybersecurity lifecycle considerations.
The risk assessment approach can vary, depending on the level of detailed information gathered during continuous
monitoring. The more detailed the information, the more the approach can move from qualitative to semiquantitative or quantitative. Also, the analytic approach can vary depending on the nature of the changes to the
system. If new vulnerabilities are identified, the approach may be vulnerability oriented. If new threats are
identified, the approach may be threat oriented. If it is necessary to primarily identify the impact to assets, an
33

40

cybersecurity risk assessments may necessitate changes to the system to mitigate newly
identified and unacceptable risk; therefore, the PM updates the Security Plan and indicates in the
POA&M how and when those changes will be implemented. The PM may need to coordinate
with organizations outside the PMO to ensure actions identified in the POA&M are feasible and
are ultimately implemented to the satisfaction of the authorizing official.
In addition to evaluating any changes to the system, the PM must maintain compliance with the
DoD Vulnerability Management (VM) policy and all the VM reporting requirements. Noncompliance with the DoD VM policy may also affect authorization.
Cybersecurity considerations also apply to disposal, 34 which is the process of reusing,
transferring, donating, selling, destroying, or otherwise disposing of excess surplus property.
During the disposal phase of the system development lifecycle, the RMF requires organizations
to implement an information system decommissioning strategy, which executes required actions
when a system is removed from service. The strategy for disposal includes the communication
approach and the management of risks associated with information system removal,
decommissioning (e.g., media sanitization, configuration management and control, and security
controls inheritance relationships), and destruction. 35 A cybersecurity risk assessment for
decommissioned systems is conducted to identify the level of risk associated with
decommissioning activities. The results of the risk assessment drive decisions on the appropriate
steps taken to, at a minimum, ensure residual classified, sensitive, or privacy information is not
exposed.
Refer to Annex E for detailed information of cybersecurity-related activities that occur during
sustainment.

asset/impact-oriented approach may be used. Note also that a combination of approaches may be necessary, as
determined by consulting the authorizing official and/or the SCA.
34
A concept known as demilitarization (DEMIL) may take place during this phase. See DAG, Chapter 4, Section
4.3.18.7 Demilitarization and Disposal. DEMIL renders safe and eliminates functional capabilities and inherent
military design features from both serviceable and unserviceable DoD materiel. It is the act of destroying the
military offensive or defensive advantages inherent in certain types of equipment or material.

Note: These are not standard acronyms and should only be referenced for use with the RASCI
matrix in this guidebook.
Cybersecurity-related activities, products, and artifacts as well as technical reviews, milestones,
and decision points are presented for each phase of the acquisition lifecycle. Because individual
program structures may be tailored, not every activity in the matrix is required for every
program. The RASCI matrix should not be thought of as a compliance checklist to achieve
cybersecurity integration. Instead, it summarizes how and when key stakeholders work together
to integrate cybersecurity into the acquisition lifecycle.

Annex C - Cybersecurity Engineering Considerations
C.1 Introduction
This annex discusses key cybersecurity topics and activities as they relate to systems engineering
for DoD acquisition programs. As explained in DoDI 5000.02, “Systems engineering provides
the integrating technical processes and design leadership to define and balance system
performance, life-cycle cost, schedule, risk, and system security within and across individual
systems and programs. The Program Manager, with support from the Lead Systems Engineer,
will embed systems engineering in program planning and execution to support the entire system
life cycle.”
The integration of cybersecurity into the systems engineering process is critical to planning for,
designing, developing, deploying, and maintaining a system that is able to meet its operational
capability requirements and is trustworthy and resilient in the face of a capable cyber adversary.
Cybersecurity is integrated into systems engineering through systems security engineering
(SSE). This annex is not intended to be a detailed guide for implementing SSE, but will
highlight key topic areas and interactions among established processes to help PMs and their
teams understand them.

C.2 Background
DoDI 5000.02 makes the program manager (PM) responsible for identifying and reducing
technical, schedule, and cost risks to the program, and even renames an early stage of the
acquisition lifecycle the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction phase, although risk
identification, reduction, and management activities occur in every other phase of the program as
well. Many of the system engineering activities occurring throughout the lifecycle of a program
are devoted to risk identification, reduction, and management. For DoD IT, see DoDI 8510.01,
Risk Management Framework (RMF) for DoD Information Technology (IT). Focused on
cybersecurity risk, DoDI 8510.01 explains that risk management should be initiated as early as
possible and fully integrated into the DoD acquisition process, including requirements
management, system engineering, and test and evaluation. Early integration of cybersecurity and
RMF activities in acquisition processes reduces risk throughout the lifecycle, and minimizes the
additional effort and cost required to achieve an authorization decision and the resources
required to manage and monitor security controls throughout the system lifecycle. Early
integration of cybersecurity requirements into a system/product/service lifecycle helps facilitate
development and deployment of more resilient systems/products/services to reduce risk to
mission operations and business functions.
The RMF for DoD IT is not intended to be implemented separately from the systems engineering
process. This approach is integral to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
Special Publication (SP) 800-37, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to
Federal Information Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach, which is the basis for the RMF
for DoD IT. “Without the early integration of security requirements, significant expense may be
incurred by the organization later in the life cycle to address security considerations that could
have been included in the initial design. When security requirements are considered as an
integral subset of other information system requirements, the resulting system has fewer
70

weaknesses and deficiencies, and therefore, less vulnerability that can be exploited in the future.
Early integration of information security requirements into the system development lifecycle is
the most cost-effective and efficient method for an organization to ensure that its protection
strategy is implemented. It also ensures that information security processes are not isolated from
the other routine management processes employed by the organization to develop, implement,
operate, and maintain information systems supporting ongoing missions and business functions.
In addition to incorporating information security requirements into the system development
lifecycle, security requirements are also integrated into the planning, programming, and
budgeting activities within the organization to ensure that resources are available when needed
and program/project milestones are completed.”
Rather than carve out a stand-alone process for implementing cybersecurity, engineers should
take a holistic approach to designing and developing a system that provides all the needed
capabilities and fulfills all the stated and derived requirements and performance specifications,
including cybersecurity. For example, cybersecurity functions, performance, and characteristics
are incorporated into the system performance specifications, item performance specifications,
item detail specifications, and the corresponding functional, allocated, and product baselines.
Programs also need to develop solution architectures that incorporate system-level security and
align with DoD Component and DoD enterprise security architectures. It is important for the
program to engage their intelligence representative as early as possible for current and future
threat information to understand the expected cyber threat environment in which the system will
operate in order to understand and detail the operational and mission requirements and flow
requirements down to system performance specifications, and detailed acquisition, engineering,
and early DT&E strategies.

C.3 Roles and Responsibilities
Because every program is designed to address a unique set of capability requirements, PMs are
allowed flexibility to structure, tailor, and phase their approach to reflect the needs and
circumstances of the system they are developing and acquiring. These characteristics may
include the complexity of the system, the need to account for certain identified threats or other
risk factors, and the expected amount of time needed to develop and produce a system that
satisfies the validated capability requirements. The same is true for the application and
integration of cybersecurity into the systems engineering process.
To ensure security is designed into the system in the most cost-efficient manner, SSE is often
integrated into systems engineering (SE) as a specialty discipline. SSE is “an element of system
engineering that applies scientific and engineering principles to identify security vulnerabilities
and minimize or contain risks associated with these vulnerabilities,” as defined in DoDI 5200.44,
Protection of Mission Critical Functions to Achieve Trusted Systems and Networks (TSN).
SSE is a process that captures and refines cybersecurity requirements and ensures these
requirements are effectively integrated into the system and components through purposeful
security architecting, design, development, and configuration. System security engineers are an
integral part of the development team designing and developing new systems or upgrading
legacy systems. System security engineers employ best practices when implementing security
controls within a system, including software engineering methodologies, system/security
71

engineering principles, secure architecture, secure design, and secure coding techniques. SSE
supports the development activities of programs and results in design-to and build-to
specifications providing lifecycle protection for critical defense resources. SSE can be
performed by a dedicated person or a variety of professionals with expertise in one or more
areas, including SE, cybersecurity, security technologies, software assurance, vulnerability
analysis, and hardware assurance. Typically, a system security engineer, or those performing
these functions, will report to the lead engineer on the program. SSE leverages and adapts the
principles and practices of SE within the same system lifecycle framework that governs SE
processes. SSE activities are intended to secure the system by both “designing-in” the necessary
countermeasures and “engineering-out” vulnerabilities throughout the lifecycle of the program.
The structure and size of the SSE organization should reflect the level of security required to
counter the threats targeting the development environment of the system and of the system itself.
The program’s linkage between SE and SSE should be described in the program’s SEP, 36 and
include details on the respective roles, responsibilities, and relationships between the system
engineer, the system security engineer, the SE Integrated Product Team (IPT), and SSE or
Cybersecurity/Information Assurance IPT/sub-IPT.
The ISSM normally chairs the
Cybersecurity/Information Assurance IPT/sub-IPT. The PM selects the chairperson of the
IPT/sub-IPT. The SEP should also discuss the SETR plan and processes, the entrance/exit and
evaluation criteria for each SETR, expected products and deliverables, and the processes that
will be used to incorporate engineering requirements and specifications into the program’s RFP
or other solicitation documentation.
Based on the resources available and the level of IT in the system, a PM may decide to augment
the SE IPT with a dedicated system security engineer, ISSM, user representative, or other subject
matter expert (SME) from a related information security or cybersecurity discipline. Tasks that
could be assigned to these individuals would include oversight of or support to the RMF-related
processes and documentation, including the Security Plan and Security Assessment Plan, which
are worked in coordination with the SCA and authorizing official. The roles, responsibilities,
and assignments of each member of the program management and engineering teams should be
spelled out in the SEP and other program management documents that outline specific roles,
responsibilities, and work assignments for all team members.

C.4 Cybersecurity Engineering References
A number of helpful resources are available to PMs and their teams that provide more detail on
the topics discussed in this annex. The following references can be used to help programs
understand additional requirements and related guidance for cybersecurity and systems security
engineering for DoD systems.

36

The SEP captures the program’s current status and evolving SE process, plan, and implementation and its
relationship to the overall program management effort. The plan documents key technical risks, processes,
resources, metrics, SE products, and completed and scheduled SE activities, along with other program management
and control efforts such as the Integrated Master Plan, Risk Management Plan, Technical Performance Measures,
and other documentation fundamental to successful program execution. For more details on SEP requirements and
processes, see the DAG, Chapter 4.

C.5 Program Protection Planning
The primary vehicle for integrating SSE activities into SE activities in the DoD is program
protection planning. Program protection is the integrating process for managing risks to DoD
warfighting capabilities from foreign intelligence collection; from hardware, software,
vulnerability, or supply chain exploitation; and from battlefield loss throughout the system
lifecycle. To mitigate these risks, a program seeks to protect technology, components, and
information from compromise and unauthorized disclosure through the cost-effective application
of countermeasures, documented in the PPP in accordance with DoDI 5000.02.
The two main analyses associated with the PPP are the TSN Analysis and the Critical Program
Information (CPI) analysis. The PPP describes the program’s CPI, mission-critical functions,
critical components, the threats to and vulnerabilities of these items, the plan to apply
countermeasures to mitigate associated risks, and planning for exportability and potential foreign
73

involvement. The PPP also discusses countermeasures to mitigate or remediate vulnerabilities
throughout the system lifecycle, including design, development, developmental and operational
testing, operations, sustainment, and disposal. Countermeasures may align to multiple security
disciplines, including anti-tamper, exportability features, security (including cybersecurity,
operations security, information security, personnel security, and physical security), secure
system design, supply chain risk management, software assurance, anti-counterfeit practices, and
procurement strategies. PMs may also incorporate automated software vulnerability analysis
tools throughout the lifecycle, and ensure remediation of software vulnerabilities is addressed in
PPPs, test plans, and contract requirements.
These processes are implemented across the full acquisition lifecycle to build security into the
system. They are repeated at each SETR, during SE analyses in preparation for each acquisition
milestone, in preparation for the RFP release, and at other points in the lifecycle, as needed. The
PPP is submitted for MDA approval at each milestone and decision review, beginning with MS
A, and is updated throughout the acquisition lifecycle.
The systems security engineer, working in concert with the Chief Systems Engineer, is usually
responsible for developing and updating the PPP and presenting the corresponding analyses at
each of the SETRs. The systems security engineer balances the security requirements among the
different security disciplines to ensure a secure and affordable system can be developed.
DoDI 5000.02 and DoDI 8500.01 require the Cybersecurity Strategy to be documented and
appended to the PPPs for all acquisition programs. DoDI 8500.01 also requires that the PPP
review process and the review of other SE documents evaluate the status of cybersecurity
solutions as part of the larger system development activities. In addition, cybersecurity is one of
the key security disciplines required to be addressed as a countermeasure to TSN and CPI risk in
the PPP.
DAG Chapters 4 and 13 offer more information on the respective roles, responsibilities, and
relationships for SE, SSE, and program protection specialists, and explains how these activities
should be integrated into the overall acquisition lifecycle planning and implementation activities.

C.6 TSN Analysis
In accordance with DoDI 5200.44, mission-critical functions and critical components must be
protected and this protection can be accomplished through TSN analysis, one of the key Program
Protection activities. Mission-critical functions are those functions of the system being acquired
that, if corrupted or disabled, would likely lead to mission failure or degradation. Critical
components are primarily the elements of the system (hardware, software, and firmware) that
implement critical functions. In addition, the system components that implement protections of
those inherently critical components (i.e., defensive measures), and other components with
unmediated access to those inherently critical components, may themselves be mission critical.
Programs conduct a criticality analysis to identify their systems’ mission-critical functions and
components throughout the lifecycle and determine the appropriate countermeasures to apply to
protect these items. The planning and execution activities include:

74

•
•
•
•
•
•

Identification of the mission-critical functions and critical components of the system,
commensurate with system requirements decomposition.
Proactive TSN Key Practices planning and implementation.
Assessment and analysis of threats, vulnerabilities, and risk for identified mission-critical
functions and critical components.
Trade-space and resource considerations.
Risk mitigations and countermeasures planning and implementation.
Risk identification after countermeasures are implemented, including follow-up
mitigation plans and actions.

A program completes TSN analysis by performing Criticality Analysis (CA), Threat Assessment
(TA), Vulnerability Assessment (VA), Risk Assessment (RA), and countermeasure selection and
application. Figure 11 describes the relationships between these activities.

Figure 11. TSN Analysis
The TSN analysis process is applied throughout the acquisition lifecycle and should take into
consideration system security risks for the program. As the system evolves, the program
reconsiders the criticality of the functions and components as well as the vulnerabilities and
threats. By periodically repeating the risk management process, the program may identify
additional threats and vulnerabilities that were not identified in previous iterations because the
level of detail of the design was not sufficient to identify them. This continuous risk
75

management with updated risks and countermeasures informs the system design trade-offs.
Discovery of a potentially malicious source from the threat assessment may warrant additional
checks for vulnerabilities in other (less critical) products procured from that source. For each
program protection risk that is very high or high, a risk cube and mitigation plans are needed (see
figure 11).
Efforts to identify mission-critical functions, critical components, and their protection begin
early in the lifecycle and are revised as system designs evolve and mature. Cybersecurity risk
assessment and TSN analysis activities and processes should inform one another to achieve a
more cohesive and comprehensive cybersecurity risk picture. The analysis is updated at each of
the technical reviews to take into account the latest design and implementation decisions as well
as additional threat and vulnerability information. The level of detail required for TSN analysis
as it progresses through the lifecycle should increase commensurate with system specification
level. Many of the security controls implemented through the RMF align with the security
specialty areas associated with TSN analysis. In these cases, controls may be implemented or
tailored as countermeasures to TSN or system security risk, documented in the PPP.

C.7 Requirements Traceability and Security Controls
Requirements are identified initially as user-stated capabilities through the JCIDS process.
These desired capabilities are decomposed and refined, then incorporated in combination with
additional “stakeholder” defined requirements that include those specified in relevant policies
and guidelines, and elicited through user and stakeholder interaction.
Baseline security control sets and DoD Component or domain-specified overlays identified via
the RMF are selected and incorporated into these initial high-level requirements. Security
controls are not initially articulated in requirements language, but are integrated into system
design via SSE requirements analysis, decomposition, validation, verification and test, and
configuration management in combination and context with all other requirements. An entrylevel decomposition of security controls into requirements statements has been conducted via the
Control Correlation Identifier (CCI) product, a standard identifier and description for each of the
singular, actionable statements that comprise a security control or best practice. CCI bridges the
gap between high-level policy expressions and low-level technical implementations. The CCI
product set can be found at http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/cci.html.
Individual CCIs may be incorporated as appropriate into initial Statements of Work or
Objectives, System Requirements Documents, Contract Data Requirements Lists (CDRLs), and
Integrated Master Plans/Schedules (IMPs/IMSs), providing direct traceability between security
controls and derived requirements and specifications that can be maintained throughout the
development lifecycle. To ensure initial user, performance, and functional requirements are
correctly translated into product specifications and the final design, the systems security
engineer/ISSM should fully participate in IPT analyses, trades, configuration management, and
risk deliberations, and throughout SETR processes and reviews.
During successive iterations of the requirements analysis and refinement processes, the set of
security controls will be further tailored to determine if they sufficiently address system
stakeholder or user requirements. Additional engineering trades (discussed below) will be
conducted within the SSE space, as well as across all SE, in light of cost, schedule, and
76

performance impacts, and may result in additional controls tailoring and other mitigations. As
the program continues to tailor the set of security controls, they are translated into requirements
and design details to ensure they mitigate vulnerabilities and risks to confidentiality, integrity,
and availability. The security requirements are captured in the capability requirements and
functional, allocated, and product technical baselines to ensure they are implemented and traced
throughout the design and development of the system. As Figure 12 shows, there should be
direct traceability between the user-stated and derived requirements, specifications, security
control sets, and tailored controls at all levels of abstraction.

Figure 12. Traceability of Requirements to Controls

C.8 Selecting and Tailoring Security Controls
Figure 13 depicts the basic process of security control selection and tailoring, and how SSE
interacts with the process.
Once the system is categorized, the next step is to identify the appropriate baseline security
controls, apply any applicable overlays, and document this initial controls set in the Security
Plan. Common controls that will be inherited are then identified. Programs should tailor the
initial control set to account more closely for conditions affecting the specific system (i.e.,
conditions related to organizational missions/business functions, information systems, or
environments of operation). See the RMF Knowledge Service, CNSSI 1253, and NIST SP 80053 for more information on the selection and tailoring of security controls. All of the controls
implemented are selected from NIST SP 800-53.
77

Figure 13. Security Control Selection and Tailoring Process
Table 4 depicts the 18 families of controls in NIST SP 800-53. The controls in these families
may fall into a number of categories. Some controls are applied at the organization level, while
some are applied to the system itself. Controls may be intended to protect, detect, react, or
restore a system’s capability. Controls can be technical in nature, focused on policy, apply to the
development environment, apply to contracting, and be operational in nature. Some controls
focus on improving resilience and some on attaining a higher level of assurance. Controls also
may be applied differently depending on the system type (e.g., enclave or PIT system) or
lifecycle phase. Although controls may be broken out and categorized in many ways, NIST SP
800-53 attempts to provide organizations with the breadth and depth of security controls
necessary to fundamentally strengthen their systems and the environments in which those
systems operate.

The product of this tailoring process is the initial tailored control set, because the tailoring of
controls is an iterative process throughout the acquisition lifecycle that reflects requirements
analysis and engineering trades after the preferred alternative is selected and the draft CDD is
developed.
Programs should also document and justify in the Security Plan any security controls from the
initial security control set that cannot or will not be implemented in the system and for which no
compensating control(s) will be substituted. At the discretion of the AO, this information may
be included in the Security Plan and the POA&M.

79

C.9 Engineering Trade Analyses
Throughout the acquisition lifecycle, the program will conduct a series of SE and SSE trade-off
analyses to assess the system’s affordability and technical feasibility to support requirements,
budget/investment, and acquisition decisions. These analyses may also depict the relationships
between system lifecycle cost and the system’s performance requirements, design parameters,
and delivery schedules. The results of these analyses should be reassessed over time as system
requirements, design, manufacturing, test, and logistics activities evolve and mature. The
iterative processes of performing requirements analyses and engineering trades can also be used
to identify any security gaps and materiel/non-materiel approaches and trade-offs among the
possible security requirements, and related controls to address those gaps.
Early integration of cybersecurity planning in the acquisition lifecycle allows for informed
design decisions and architectural trade space options that foster improved system efficiency and
effectiveness in the face of the rapidly changing threats.
Several categories of trades occur throughout the acquisition lifecycle that may impact
cybersecurity performance in DoD systems and networks.
These include capability,
performance, and cost trade-offs, and lesser trades made daily in engineering judgment as part of
requirements development and design, as well as in configuration management throughout the
lifecycle.
The impacts of nonfunctional requirements (e.g., suitability, survivability,
cybersecurity, interoperability, safety) are considered during functional performance trade-offs.
All such categories of trades are discussed in the DoD 5000-series issuances.
For example, in support of the validation of the CDD (or equivalent requirements document), the
PM may decide to conduct an SE trade-off analysis to show how cost varies as a function of
system requirements (including KPPs), major design parameters, and schedule. The results
would then be provided to the MDA to identify major affordability drivers and show how the
program meets affordability constraints.
Additional trades may be considered between security controls, system functional performance
requirements, and potential costs of an affordable set of mitigations that would reduce identified
risks to an acceptable level. Risks identified through the TSN analyses will also inform these
trades. Regardless of how and when the trades are discussed and completed, programs should:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Modify the tailored set of controls based on the results of analyses and engineering
trades.
Ensure updates to tailored security controls set are reflected in the Security Plan.
Ensure mitigations are documented and reflected in the updated PPP.
Develop and map initial security specifications and requirements from the identified
mitigations.
Identify the strength of implementation and effectiveness of the updated tailored security
control set.
Review the residual risk and determine if additional security mitigations are warranted.

80

Figure 13 shows how SE and SSE, informed by TSN analyses and other program protection
activities, affect the tailored set of controls implemented to protect the system based on updated
cybersecurity and TSN risk assessments. The final set of tailored controls is documented in the
Security Plan and approved by the authorizing official.

C.10 Systems Engineering Technical Reviews 37
From a cybersecurity perspective, the PM, with support from the Lead Systems Engineer, should
use the SETR process to integrate SE, program planning, and cybersecurity throughout the entire
lifecycle of the system and demonstrate the system is able to meet its operational capability
requirements and is trustworthy and resilient in the face of a capable cyber adversary. DoDI
5000.02 and DAG Chapters 4 and 13 describe the SETR process as a series of technical reviews
and audits that are conducted at various points along the lifecycle of a program to evaluate
progress for the system in development and maturity of the design, and serve as a basis for
managing/reducing risk while transitioning between lifecycle phases. The reviews are intended
to be event-driven and based on the entrance and exit criteria as documented in the SEP.

37

See DAG Chapters 4 and 13 for more detail on the SSE and PPP aspects of the SETRs.

Annex D - Cybersecurity Test and Evaluation Considerations
D.1 Introduction
The overarching DoD cybersecurity acquisition policy is documented in DoDD 5000.01, The
Defense Acquisition System, and DoDI 5000.02, Operation of the Defense Acquisition System.
DoDD 5000.01 states, “Acquisition managers shall address information assurance requirements
for all weapon systems; Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence,
Surveillance, and Reconnaissance systems; and information technology programs that depend on
external information sources or provide information to other DoD systems. DoD policy for
information assurance of information technology, including NSS, appears in DoD Directive
8500.01E.”
DoDI 5000.02 states, “Cybersecurity RMF steps and activities, as described in DoD
Instruction 8510.01…should be initiated as early as possible and fully integrated into the DoD
acquisition process including requirements management, system engineering, and test and
evaluation. Integration of the RMF in acquisition processes reduces required effort to achieve
authorization to operate and subsequent management of security controls throughout the
system life cycle.”
Additionally, the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation has published specific procedures for
the conduct of cybersecurity operational testing. 38 This guidance states in part that “the purpose
of cybersecurity operational test and evaluation is to evaluate the ability of a unit equipped with a
system to support assigned missions in the expected operational environment … Early involved
of programs with the operational test community is required to ensure that system requirements
are measureable and testable, and that the rationale behind the requirements and the intended
operational environment are understood.”
This annex will assist programs in integrating cybersecurity testing during both DT&E and
OT&E. This testing, as well as all relevant SE, fraud prevention, validation, interoperability, and
acquisitions processes, should be synchronized with the DoD RMF processes for assessment and
authorization.
The PM is responsible for identifying the program’s test team, including the Chief
Developmental Tester and the lead T&E organizations, and for developing and implementing a
robust cybersecurity T&E strategy. The goal of cybersecurity T&E is to improve the resilience of
military capabilities before development is completed and production and deployment begin.
Early discovery of system vulnerabilities can facilitate remediation to reduce the impact on cost,
schedule, and performance. This annex provides an overview intended for the PM. DAG Chapter
9 provides detailed guidance for the Chief Developmental Tester and lead DT&E organizations.

DOT&E Memorandum: “Procedures for Operational Test and Evaluation of Cybersecurity in Acquisition
Programs” dated August 1, 2014

82

D.2 Cybersecurity Test and Evaluation
The focus of both developmental and operational cybersecurity T&E is to help programs and
acquisition decision makers manage risks to operations in the cyberspace domain by identifying
and resolving shortfalls as soon as possible. Figure 14 illustrates the procedures overlaid on a
notional acquisition lifecycle.

Figure 14 - Cybersecurity T&E Process Mapped to the Acquisition Lifecycle
Programs complete the full cybersecurity T&E process, regardless of the point at which they
enter the acquisition cycle. If T&E in a realistic operational environment is not feasible because
of operational risk, counterintelligence, or protection of penetration techniques, then alternative
evaluation strategies will be identified (including use of dedicated cyber ranges) and included in
an approved TEMP. The TEMP should define an integrated cybersecurity T&E strategy to assess
the cybersecurity capability of the system. The integrated cybersecurity T&E strategy uses
cybersecurity-related data from all available sources, including the RMF security assessments,
security inspections, component/system/system-of-system tests, testing in an operational
environment, and testing with systems and networks operated by representative end users and/or
network service providers to ascertain the cybersecurity capability of a system. The T&E
Evaluation Framework included in the TEMP must consider system cybersecurity requirements
and correlate them with sources of information such as dedicated cybersecurity tests.
The following paragraphs describe the six phases of the cybersecurity T&E process. The PM is
responsible for ensuring the process is adequately resourced and performed within the program.
D.2.1 Developmental Test and Evaluation
DT&E is performed as early as possible in the acquisition lifecycle to identify system
vulnerabilities in order to facilitate remediation and reduce impact on cost, schedule and
performance. For programs under DASD(DT&E) oversight, an evaluation of cybersecurity will
be performed at Defense Acquisition Executive Summary reviews and in DT&E Assessments
provided at major decision points, as required by DoDI 5000.02. The cybersecurity T&E phases
supporting developmental test and evaluation are summarized below; detailed information of the
implementation of these phases is included in the DAG, section 9.6.5.

83

D.2.1.1 Understand Cybersecurity Requirements
As early as possible within the acquisition process, the Chief Developmental Tester, in
collaboration with the T&E Working-level Integrated Product Team (WIPT), examines the
Acquisition Strategy, the capability requirements document, the Program Protection Plan, and all
other documents and regulations to gain an understanding of the breadth and depth of the
system’s cybersecurity requirements (specified, implied, and essential). The Chief
Developmental Tester and T&E WIPT will ensure system cybersecurity requirements are
complete and testable. In addition, the T&E WIPT reviews threat documents to understand the
cyber threats to the system. Based on the requirements review, the T&E WIPT constructs a T&E
strategy to address the cybersecurity requirements and threat profiles. This phase will be
performed iteratively, as system development proceeds.
D.2.1.2 Characterize the Cyber Attack Surface
The attack surface defines the system’s exposure to reachable and exploitable vulnerabilities, to
include any hardware, software, connection, data exchange, service, removable media, etc., that
might expose the system to potential threat access. The T&E WIPT collaborates with
engineering and system developers to determine and prioritize the elements and interfaces of the
system that, based on criticality and vulnerability analysis, require specific attention in the
cybersecurity section of the T&E strategy. The T&E WIPT updates the MS B (or relevant
milestone) TEMP with plans for testing and evaluating the elements and interfaces of the system
deemed susceptible to cyber threats.
D.2.1.3 Cooperative Vulnerability Identification
The Chief Developmental Tester defines vulnerability-type testing for contractor and
government cybersecurity testing at the component and subsystem levels. This testing assists
in refining the scope and objectives for subsequent cybersecurity T&E and is integrated to the
greatest extent possible into the T&E program as a whole. Preparation for vulnerability testing
is performed, in part, by understanding the cybersecurity kill chain (i.e., by considering how an
adversary might exploit vulnerabilities). It is necessary to understand the sequence of
adversary activities used to execute a cyber-attack. The vulnerabilities identified in this and
previous phases should be resolved or mitigated before the program proceeds to a full end-toend DT&E assessment.
D.2.1.4 Adversarial Cybersecurity DT&E
This phase is an end-to-end assessment in a representative mission context to evaluate the
system’s readiness for limited procurement/deployment and operational testing. This activity
focuses on conducting a rigorous cybersecurity test in an environment as realistic as available
and requires the use of a threat-representative test team that tests the potential and actual
impacts to the system. Results of this testing will be included as part of the DT&E assessment,
which typically occurs before MS C. Shortfalls identified in this and previous activities should
be resolved before proceeding to OT&E, and program should plan sufficient time and
resources for these resolutions.

84

D.2.2 Operational Test and Evaluation
Operational cybersecurity T&E is required to be conducted for all systems capable of sending or
receiving digital information, including those that upload/download data by physical means or
removable devices. The TEMP and Test Plan for cybersecurity OT&E should be structured in
the two phases shown below with the goal of identifying all significant vulnerabilities and
characterizing the operational risk imposed by them. Cybersecurity OT&E is informed by but
not wholly satisfied by the RMF process. TEMPS and Test Plans for systems under OT&E
oversight require DOT&E review and approval and must meet requirements defined in
Attachments D and E of the DOT&E Memorandum “Procedures for Operational Test and
Evaluation of Cybersecurity in Acquisition Programs.” 39
D.2.2.1 Cooperative Vulnerability and Penetration Assessment
This phase will be conducted as an overt, cooperative, and comprehensive examination of the
system to identify vulnerabilities and to characterize the system’s operational cybersecurity
status. This test event shall be conducted by a vulnerability assessment and penetration testing
team through document reviews, physical inspection, personnel interviews, and the use of
automated scanning, password tests, and applicable exploitation tools. The assessment must be
conducted in the intended operational environment with representative operators to the greatest
extent possible. This testing event may be integrated with DT&E activities, if conducted in a
realistic operational environment and approved by the DOT&E. The minimum data required for
this phase of testing is identified via Attachments A and B of the DOT&E Memorandum cited
above.
D.2.2.2 Adversarial Assessment
This phase will assess the ability of a system to support its missions while withstanding validated
and representative cyber threat activity. In addition to assessing the effect on mission execution,
the test shall evaluate the ability of the system to detect threat activity, react to threat activity,
and restore mission effectiveness degraded or lost due to threat activity. This test event must be
conducted by an operational test agency employing a certified adversarial team to act as a cyberaggressor. The adversarial assessment should include representative operators and users, local
and remote cyber network defenders (including upper tier computer network defense providers),
an operational network configuration, and a representative mission with expected network
traffic 40. Where necessary due to operational limits or security, tests may use simulations, closed
environments, cyber ranges or other validated tools approved by DOT&E. The minimum data to
be collected for this phase of testing is identified via Attachment C of the DOT&E Memorandum
cited above, and is focused on determining the mission effects resulting from vulnerabilities or
penetrations of the system under test.

D.3 Overarching Cybersecurity T&E Guidelines for the PM
The PM should ensure the following are implemented and appropriately resourced within the
program:

Programs” dated August 1st 2014.

•

Test activities integrate RMF security controls assessments with tests of commonly
exploited and emerging vulnerabilities early in the acquisition lifecycle.
The TEMP details how testing will provide the information needed to assess
cybersecurity and inform acquisition decisions. The TEMP must identify cybersecurity
measures and resources and provide all information identified in the DOT&E
Memorandum cited above.
The cybersecurity T&E process requires the development and testing of mission-driven
cybersecurity requirements, which may require specialized systems engineering and T&E
expertise. The Chief Developmental Tester may request assistance from SMEs to
implement the process. SMEs may be especially helpful in developing testable
cybersecurity requirements that reflect:
− Explicit risk management decisions related to potential harm arising through the
acquired system
− Realistic, achievable expectations for system cybersecurity capabilities
− The system’s role in a holistic cyber defense to achieve a resilient mission capability.

•

The T&E WIPT seeks opportunities to improve efficiency by integrating cybersecurity
into other planned T&E events.
Sufficient time and test articles are made available for adversarial assessments in both
developmental and operations test phases as these tests may interfere with other test
objectives (such as availability or reliability tests).

Annex E - Cybersecurity Lifecycle and Sustainment Considerations
The purpose of the operations and support (O&S) phase (sustainment) is to execute the product
support strategy, satisfy materiel readiness and operational support performance requirements,
and sustain the system over its lifecycle (to include disposal). O&S is described in detail in the
LCSP, initially developed during the Materiel Solution Analysis phase, and evolved during the
TMRR and the EMD lifecycle phases when threat assessments, risk analyses, and early design
decisions occur. Cybersecurity support needed in sustainment includes software support
activities, help desk, vulnerability management, and assessing the risk of changes to the system,
the evolving threat, and the operational environment.
It is recommended the Cybersecurity WIPT 41 or Logistics WIPT ensure required activities in the
O&S phase are conducted in accordance with DoDI 8510.01, Risk Management Framework
(RMF) for DoD Information Technology (IT), Step 6.
Cybersecurity activities in the O&S phase include:
Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM): ISCM helps ensure the Cybersecurity
Strategy is successfully implemented. 42 ISCM does not replace the requirement for system
reaccreditation every three years; however, it is an enabler for continuous reauthorization. ISCM
is also an enabler for the required annual RMF for DoD IT reporting requirements. Annual
reviews are required by the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002.
Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts 43 (IAVAs): An IAVA is a notification of an
operating system, utility, or application software vulnerability. IAVAs are distributed to all DoD
computer installations and PMOs in the form of alerts, bulletins, and technical advisories
identified by the US Cyber Command DoD Computer Emergency Readiness Team. Each IAVA
is analyzed by a security engineer with applicable technical background and implemented if
applicable, but only after regression testing to ensure the system continues to function. The
acquisition PM should ensure all locations where the developed system is deployed receive,
analyze, implement where applicable, and maintain an account of IAVAs. IAVAs can be
tracked by the program or Component ISSO.
Warning Order (WARNORD)/Operation Order (OPORD): The WARNORD/OPORD replaces
the Communications Tasking Order (CTO)/Fragmentary Orders (FRAGO) 44 outlining specific
requirements for deployment and implementation of a capability on the Non-secure Internet
Protocol Router Network (NIPRNet) and Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet).
41

The Cybersecurity WIPT is sometimes organized as a cybersecurity sub-WIPT and is subordinate to the SE
WIPT. A cybersecurity Support Working Group could also be subordinate to the Logistics (or Supportability or
Sustainment) WIPT.
42
Per DoDI 8510.01, Section f.(1).(a).1
43
IAVAs are maintained on the DISA site. (http://iase.disa.mil)
44
CTO/FRAGO requirements were originally published by the Joint Task Force Global Network Operations. The
current WARNORDs and OPORDs are under the authority of US Cyber Command, which has supplanted the Joint
Task Force Global Network Operations.

87

They are created to assist a system administrator or reviewer/auditor in assessing specified
requirements. Each program logistics organization (either the PMO or appropriate logistics
depot/organization) is responsible for analysis, implementation, and documentation of a specific
WARNORD or OPORD.
Analysis and compliance are mandatory.
Note that
WARNORDs/OPORDs are more than patches or configuration updates; they can be relatively
extensive.
Software patches and updates: Many enterprises within the DoD automate patch updates and
software updates for operating systems and DoD standard software applications. 45 For
applications such as databases and developed applications, updates are scheduled. Software
updates should be analyzed to determine if reauthorization is required. Patches usually address
bug fixes and cybersecurity issues. Applying patches usually does not trigger reauthorization.
Per DoDI 8500.01, Enclosure 3, paragraph 9.b.(11), “all IA products and IA-enabled products
that require use of the product’s IA capabilities will comply with the evaluation and validation
requirements of Committee on National Security Systems Policy 11, National Policy Governing
the Acquisition of Information Assurance (IA) and IA-Enabled Information Technology
Products, June 2013, as amended.”
National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) Common Criteria Evaluation and Validation
Scheme (CCEVS) evaluation (https://www.niap-ccevs.org) is published on the NIAP-CCEVS
Products Compliance List. 46 NIAP-certified products have been assessed from a security
perspective, helping to reduce the existence of potential vulnerabilities. In most cases, the
respective vendors continually maintain their products, mitigating vulnerabilities and distributing
fixes to licensed users. Since these products have been evaluated, many of the system patches,
security fixes, and version updates are pushed to systems connected to DoD networks. The
CCEVS and the Unified Capabilities Requirements (UCR) are intended to complement each
other in scope and capability, with minimal overlap.
Anti-virus/HIDS signatures are maintained and updated: Each DoD enclave ensures all hosts are
configured with current anti-virus definitions and intrusion detection and prevention signatures.
Updates should be pushed to each host weekly (or sooner in the case of a new known
vulnerability). Most DoD installations facilitate this process using the HBSS. 47
Firmware (e.g., Basic Input/Output System) is updated securely: Procedures and provisions for
secure firmware updates may be defined as part of the system or component support manuals.
Firmware updates are analyzed to determine if an increase in residual risk has occurred; if so, a
reauthorization is required.

45

Patches are supported for DoD-approved software applications. Signature updates are pushed using the HostBased Security System (HBSS).
46
Reference https://www.niap-ccevs.org/CCEVS_Products/pcl.cfm.
47
Since many bases/installations support HBSS and related activities, the PM’s responsibility is minimal. It may be
as simple as confirming anti-virus updates are furnished as part of an enterprise and documenting this fact in the
Security Plan. For systems not connected to a network, the PM ensures a method for updating virus definitions is
implemented. The PMO (through the ISSM or ISSO) documents the control is satisfied by the base/installation into
the program’s RMF database in the Enterprise Mission Assurance Support Service.

88

Equipment is updated securely: Procedures and provisions for secure hardware updates or
replacement should be documented in system or component support manuals. Hardware updates
are analyzed to determine if an increase in residual risk has occurred; if so, a reauthorization is
required. During both the TMRR and EMD phases (as part of system and security requirements
definition and solicitation of the development and production contract[s]), the PM should ensure
that system and security requirements specifications mandate the use of DoD-approved products
by the development and production contractor. Sources for approved hardware can be found on
the DISA UC APL at https://iase.disa.mil. Where applicable, systems should operate within the
DoDIN.
Reauthorization in accordance with DoD RMF requirements: Per DoDI 8510.01, Enclosure 6,
para 2.f.(6).(a), “In accordance with Appendix III of OMB Circular A-130, systems must be
reassessed and reauthorized every 3 years or as a result of a system update that negatively affects
the security posture (whichever is less).” Program Offices or appropriate logistics organizations
plan for this activity. The results of an annual cybersecurity review 48 or a negative change to the
system or environment at any time (i.e., a change increasing the residual risk) may result in a
need for reauthorization prior to the regular three-year reauthorization.
Local infrastructure: Site personnel maintain local site infrastructure, facility, physical, and
procedural security requirements during sustainment.
The PMO itself may not execute 49 the activities during sustainment (i.e., some acquisition PMs
are not responsible for system management throughout the entire O&S phase of the lifecycle).
However, the PMO is active during all phases of the program acquisition lifecycle to ensure
certain cybersecurity sustainment capabilities (e.g., continuous monitoring “agents”) are
incorporated into the system and the system is implemented such that cybersecurity protection is
supported through the decommissioning/disposal phase.
During sustainment, due diligence should be maintained with regard to the cybersecurity posture.
Should the threat change or a significant change to the system require a patch or system upgrade,
then the PM should assess the fix by way of a vulnerability assessment (e.g., Blue Team
activities) and/or penetration testing (e.g., Red Team activities) to ascertain the limitations and
capabilities of the fix. The results of these assessments and tests help determine the effectiveness
of implemented security controls that are monitored over time and updated or improved to
address changes in threats, vulnerabilities, and the environment. Also any cybersecurity issues
are identified, mitigated, and documented in the POA&M as the result of testing and audits.
Overview – Decommissioning/Disposal
The final phase of the acquisition lifecycle is the disposal and demilitarization of excess and
surplus property. The DAG recommends surplus equipment be made available within the U.S.
government to maximize the government’s investment. One caveat is to ensure that
48

Annual reviews are required by the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002. These assessments
are more along the lines of a checklist. Vulnerability assessments (e.g., Blue Team testing) and penetration tests
(e.g., Red Team testing) are not included as part of the annual review.
49
The PMO works with the cognizant local support organizations during earlier phases of development (TMRR and
EMD) to define roles and responsibilities for sustainment. These are usually defined as part of the Logistics WIPT.

89

decommissioning and/or disposal of surplus equipment does not compromise classified or
sensitive information. It is possible to minimize the need for abandonment or destruction, thus
mitigating potential cybersecurity risks. During earlier phases (TMRR and EMD) and system
design, the systems engineer supports the PM’s plans for the system’s demilitarization and
disposal through the identification and documentation of hazards and hazardous materials related
to the system, using MIL-STD-882E, DoD Standard Practice for System Safety. 50 From a
cybersecurity perspective, the PM ensures a risk assessment is complete and any risks associated
with surplus and disposal are mitigated. One of the more common risks is associated with data
remanence. If not properly implemented, residual classified data and privacy data could be
retained on media (e.g., disk drives, Universal Serial Bus drives) and memory that is no longer
protected.
Sanitization can be achieved for nonvolatile media by simple overwrite or purging (e.g., multiple
overwrites, or in cases of older media, degaussing). Volatile media can be sanitized by removal
of power (e.g., Random Access Memory and some mobile device media). If no means of
sanitization is possible or effective, destruction of the media is necessary. Per NIST SP 800-88,
while some techniques may render it infeasible to retrieve the data through the device interface
and to use the device for subsequent storage of data, the device is not considered destroyed
unless data cannot be retrieved. Verification usually requires use of advanced laboratory
techniques. For systems that process classified data, media destruction is required. Many media
types are available, and there are different techniques and procedures for different types of media
destruction. Per DoDI 8500.01, disposal and destruction of classified hard drives, electronic
media, processing equipment components, and the like will be accomplished in accordance with
CNSSI 4004.1. 51 Destruction can be achieved through disintegration, pulverizing, melting, and
incineration. These methods are typically carried out at an outsourced metal destruction or
licensed incineration facility with the specific capabilities to perform these activities effectively,
securely, and safely. Data remanence applies to any system and device with any kind of
memory, disks, printers that contain memory, specialized devices, network routers, and
associated equipment. 52
The PM ensures challenges associated with destruction are addressed early in the acquisition
lifecycle. Per DoDI 8510.01, 53 “once a system has been decommissioned, the Security Plan
should be updated to reflect the system’s decommissioned status and the system should be
removed from all tracking systems. Other artifacts and supporting documentation should be
disposed of according to its sensitivity or classification. Data or objects in cybersecurity
infrastructures that support the DoD Information Enterprise, such as key management, identity
management, vulnerability management, and privilege management, should be reviewed for
impact.”

54

For classified information, in addition to destruction, the system’s status is documented
and submitted to the responsible security officer. 54
If the media do not contain classified data, the PM should ensure a risk analysis is
conducted early in the acquisition program lifecycle to ensure sensitive (e.g.,
Unclassified//For Official Use Only [U//FOUO], privacy data, and financial information)
is rendered inaccessible.
Systems that inherit security controls from a decommissioned system must re-evaluate
their system and ensure the “dis-inherited” controls are implemented on their respective
system. If a service level agreement (SLA) is in place, it no longer applies. Signatories of
an SLA are notified of a system’s decommissioning so they can satisfy their respective
security controls.

Annex F - Cybersecurity Risk Assessment Process
F.1 Cybersecurity Risk Assessments
Cybersecurity risk assessment is a key component of a holistic, organization-wide cybersecurity
risk management process defined in NIST Special Publication 800-39. As depicted in Figure 15,
the cybersecurity risk management process includes: (i) framing risk; (ii) assessing risk; (iii)
responding to risk; and (iv) monitoring risk. This section focuses on assessing risk so the
authorizing official may respond to risk appropriately. Risk monitoring activities inform the
system’s ATO and will prompt the authorizing official to respond accordingly.
Risk is a measure of the
extent to which an entity is
threatened by a potential
circumstance or event, and is
typically a function of: (i)
adverse impacts that would
arise if the circumstance or
event
occurs
and
(ii)
likelihood of occurrence.
Cybersecurity risks are risks
that arise from the loss of
confidentiality, integrity, or
availability of information or
2:

15.
Risk
Assessment
within the Risk Management
information systems and PIT
Process
systems and reflect potential
adverse
impacts
to
organizational operations (i.e., mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets,
individuals, other organizations, and the nation. Note that the focus is on impact to the system’s
ability to support the mission, not impact to the IS/PIT system itself.
Cybersecurity risk assessment is the process of identifying, estimating, and prioritizing
cybersecurity risks. Assessing risk requires the careful analysis of threat and vulnerability
information to determine the extent to which circumstances or events could adversely impact an
organization and the likelihood that such circumstances or events will occur. A risk model
identifies risk factors. The risk factors of concern are threat sources, threat events, likelihood,
vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions, and impact.
Figure 16 illustrates the risk model, including the risk factors discussed above and the
relationship among them. The degree to which each risk factor is used in the risk assessment
process depends on the availability and detail of information related to that risk factor. For
example, detailed threat source or threat event data may not always be available, so risk
assessors may need to make some assumptions. Any assumptions are clearly stated in the
documentation of the risk assessment results (e.g., Security Plan, risk assessment report). Unlike
assessing risk to acquisition program objectives, which the PM leads, these cybersecurity risk
assessments can be led by the PM or the cybersecurity community throughout the lifecycle to
inform tailoring of security controls and corresponding cybersecurity design requirements and
92

system updates based on mitigations to moderate and/or high risks. For example, when tailoring
the controls, the PM tasks the ISSM and systems security engineers to perform the assessment
and document the results in the Security Plan. The PM also uses cybersecurity and TSN risk
assessments to make risk-based trade-offs that are explained/captured in acquisition and/or SE
documentation. The SCA may examine these documents to understand design decisions. PMs
support development of mitigation plans and incorporate approved materiel mitigation plans in
their program cost, schedule, and performance plans.

Figure 16. Generic Risk Model with Key Risk Factors
Risk assessments (formal or informal) are conducted at various steps in the acquisition lifecycle
and at key steps in the RMF, including:
•
•

•
•
•
•

Before each milestone and decision point.
At each SETR (progressively more detailed as the concept evolves from conceptual
architecture at ASR, to initial system-level design system performance requirements at
SRR, to final system-level design the functional baseline at SFR, to preliminary item
detail design at PDR, to detailed item final design at CDR).
IS/PIT system categorization (to understand impact values for each information type
processed by the system).
Security control selection (to understand system-specific threats that may exploit
vulnerabilities, thus driving the need to tailor security controls).
Security control implementation (to identify, understand, and justify risk-based tradeoffs).
Security control assessment (to understand the severity of vulnerabilities created or not
addressed by ineffectively implemented security controls, measured against likelihood
and impact).
93

•
•

IS/PIT system authorization (to ascertain, vet with stakeholders, and accept mission risk
and/or community risk).
Security control monitoring (to determine the impacts of proposed or imposed changes to
the system, its environment, or its use).

The resulting risk rating is conveyed to the authorizing official, who responds in some manner
(e.g., approve the Security Plan, authorize the system to operate, recommend or direct corrective
actions to mitigate risk to an acceptable level) consistent with the organizational risk frame.
The DoD’s cybersecurity risk assessment process is adopted from NIST SP 800-30. While the
NIST process steps/tasks, lexicon, risk factors, definitions, and five-tier scale (see Figure 17)
must be followed (to ensure reciprocity across the Federal, DoD, and Intelligence communities),
the level of rigor is adjustable within each step/task. This flexibility is necessary because the
information, expertise, and resources required to perform each step/task may not always be
readily available. However, in communicating the results of any risk assessment, the level of
rigor is explicitly identified per step/task.
The risk assessment
process is composed of
four steps: (i) prepare
for the assessment; (ii)
conduct the assessment;
(iii)
communicate
assessment results; and
(iv)
maintain
the
assessment.
The appropriate risk
model and analytic
approach depend on
where the system is in
the acquisition lifecycle.
If a risk model has been
developed for a specific
capability, that risk
model should be used
during
the
risk
assessment process.

Figure 17. Risk Assessment Process

Risk is assessed quantitatively, qualitatively, or semi-qualitatively. Due to uncertainties and lack
of quantifiable data, it is often necessary to use a semi-qualitative model or more often a
qualitative model. Uncertainty is inherent in evaluation of risk, due to such considerations as: (i)
limitations on the extent to which the future will resemble the past; (ii) imperfect or incomplete
knowledge of the threat (e.g., characteristics of adversaries, including tactics, techniques, and
94

procedures); (iii) undiscovered vulnerabilities in technologies or products; and (iv) unrecognized
dependencies, which can lead to unforeseen impacts.
Analysts use one of the following three approaches to arrive at a risk level: (i) threat oriented; (ii)
asset/impact oriented; or (iii) vulnerability-oriented. NIST SP 800-30 primarily takes a threatoriented approach, in which analysts begin with the possible threat events and determine the
likelihood threat sources will initiate or cause those threat events to exploit vulnerabilities or
predisposing conditions and cause an impact. The threat-oriented approach may be most
appropriate during the system categorization and the selection of controls, as the technology is
usually not selected at this point and the technical vulnerabilities cannot be known. An
asset/impact-oriented approach starts with identification of impacts of concern to critical assets
then identifies threat events that could lead to and/or threat sources that could seek those impacts.
The asset/impact-oriented approach may be most appropriate when designing a system or to
determine which components of a design need the most protection or should be re-designed to
eliminate vulnerabilities or single points of failure. Following the security controls assessment,
it is most appropriate to take a vulnerability-oriented approach, in which analysts begin with a set
of predisposing conditions or weaknesses/deficiencies (e.g., non-compliant security controls) and
estimate the likelihood threat sources will initiate or cause threat events that could exploit those
vulnerabilities and cause an impact. Any of the approaches may be appropriate following
authorization of the system, depending on whether a new threat or a new vulnerability is being
assessed, or there is simply a need to determine the impact of proposed changes.
In determining the level of risk, consider that risk is a function of likelihood and the level of
impact. 55 Likelihood is a function of the vulnerability or predisposing condition and the
relevance of the threat. Vulnerability severity is a function of the raw vulnerability and the
effectiveness of mitigation actions. The relevance of the threat is based on a non-adversarial
threat source’s range of effects or an adversarial threat source’s capability, intent, and targeting.
Table 5 is used to determine the risk based on the overall likelihood and the level of impact
ratings. Similarly, a matrix could be used to determine the likelihood by placing the
vulnerability/predisposing condition on the vertical axis and the threat relevance on the
horizontal axis.

55

NIST SP 800-30 defines impact level as “the magnitude of harm that can be expected to result from the
consequences of unauthorized disclosure of information, unauthorized modification of information, unauthorized
destruction of information, or loss of information or information system availability.” It defines the assigned impact
value as “The assessed potential impact resulting from a compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability
of an information type, expressed as a value of low, moderate, or high.”

As the risk model and analytical approach are considered for each risk assessment, an additional
factor to be considered is alignment with existing or related risk management and risk
assessment processes. In accordance with DoDI 5200.44, DoDI 5000.02, and DAG Chapter 13,
TSN analysis is performed to protect mission-critical functions and components within covered
systems. TSN analysis activities begin early in the lifecycle and are revised as a system design
evolves and matures. The analysis is updated at each of the technical reviews to take into
account the latest design and implementation decisions as well as additional threat and
vulnerability information. For acquisition programs, this analysis is documented in the PPP.
When applicable, cybersecurity risk assessment and TSN analysis activities and processes inform
one another, to achieve a more cohesive and comprehensive cybersecurity risk picture for the
system and program.

Annex G - Summary of Cybersecurity-Related Artifacts
A primary consideration for the PM relates to generation and use of cybersecurity-related
artifacts. These artifacts provide essential information for both identifying achievable
cybersecurity requirements and acquiring a system that meets these requirements. A goal of the
new cybersecurity approach is to maximize use of existing acquisition program management,
systems engineering, test and evaluation, configuration management, and risk management
documentation and artifacts. As such, the Program Office and assessment community should
work together to identify and document where the related cybersecurity information can be
found in existing documentation as opposed to creating new cybersecurity artifacts. Major
artifacts appear in alphabetical order by name in Table 6. See DoDI 8510.01 and the RMF
Knowledge Service for further information on individual cybersecurity RMF artifacts. In some
cases, more than one approval authority is listed, separated by a semicolon. In these instances,
the first authority listed applies to programs under Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD)
oversight, and the second applies to those under Component-level oversight.

Program protection is the integrating process for managing risks to advanced
technology and mission-critical system functionality from foreign collection,
design vulnerability or supply chain exploit/insertion, and battlefield loss
throughout the acquisition lifecycle. The process of preparing a PPP is
intended to help Program Offices consciously think through which technology,
components, and information need to be protected and to develop a plan to
provide that protection. Once a PPP is in place, it should guide Program
Office security measures and be updated as threats and vulnerabilities change
or are better understood.
The PPP should be a usable reference within the program for understanding
and managing the full spectrum of program and systems security activities
throughout the acquisition lifecycle. The PPP contains the information
someone working on the program needs to carry out his or her program
protection responsibilities, and it should be generated as part of the program
planning process.

The TEMP serves as the overarching document for managing a T&E program.
PMs develop a draft TEMP in support of the Development RFP Release
Decision Point decision to be used during the EMD phase. The TEMP
includes sufficient detail to support development of other test-related
documents. PMs structure a T&E program strategy with inclusion of
cybersecurity to provide knowledge to reduce risk in acquisition and
operational decisions. The evaluations of all available and relevant data and
information from contractor and government sources develop that knowledge.
The evaluation should focus on providing essential information to decision
makers, specifically with regard to attainment of technical performance
attributes and an assessment of the system’s missions operational
effectiveness, operational suitability, and survivability or operational security.
The evaluation framework supports estimates for test resource requirements
and provides a basis for determining test program adequacy and assessing risk
margins within the T&E plans and events. For details and content of the
TEMP, refer to the DAG, Chapter 9, T&E.

Annex H - Cybersecurity Request for Proposal Considerations

NOTE: This sample RFP language is a reference only and is not intended to be
used as-is. The sample language can assist the PM and his/her team in developing
an RFP that reflects the specific stakeholder cybersecurity requirements and the
specifics of the solution under development. It is important for the PM and
his/her team to integrate cybersecurity into their SSE approach to achieve the
most cost-effective system security.

H.1 Overview
To achieve a cost-effective cybersecurity implementation, the program manager (PM) and the
functional staff must recognize systems security engineering begins at or before the material
solution analysis (MSA) phase. Cybersecurity considerations, incorporated into the larger SSE
activities, are grounded in a technical approach with understandable, achievable, testable, and
measurable performance requirements.
The PM must understand the cybersecurity requirements prior to release of any solicitation,
starting with the Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction RFP and Draft CDD at MS A.
Subsequent RFPs must address user-validated cybersecurity requirements in the CDD and CPD
(or equivalent capability requirements documents). To do this, the PM ensures all cybersecurity
capabilities (provided via Draft CDD, CDD, or CPD) are decomposed into the governmentowned technical requirements baseline and included within the RFP to the contractor(s),
enabling the contractor to properly respond to the RFP and giving the PM an early understanding
of the cybersecurity impact to the program. Many cybersecurity capability requirements are
included within the mandatory system survivability key performance parameter (KPP).
However, PMs should review all KPPs and KSAs to ensure they have a full understanding of the
breadth and depth of cybersecurity requirements. The PM, in reviewing the draft CDD, will
provide feedback to the user representative in regards to technical and affordability feasibility.
This should be done by a Systems Security Engineer or a similarly qualified individual on the
PM’s staff.
Often, these derived cybersecurity requirements span across the government acquisition
organization (the PMO), the government user, and the system definition and development
contractor. The PM accounts for and tracks all cybersecurity requirements, not just those put on
contract to the development contractor. All cybersecurity requirements should be part of the
government-owned requirements baseline and verification cross reference matrix/index, allowing
the validation approach for each requirement to be integrated early into the SSE and T&E
activities.
104

Key cybersecurity considerations when beginning solicitation activities are as follows:
•
•
•
•
•

Ensure program planning documentation, even in draft, reflects achieving stakeholder
and program cybersecurity requirements.
Ensure an integrated cybersecurity strategy and approach addresses the total lifecycle of
the system.
Ensure the specific cybersecurity test ranges/facilities and test support equipment are
identified for each type of testing.
Ensure cybersecurity requirements are part of the budget and cost estimates, as part of the
program’s plans and schedule.
Consider cybersecurity aspects of Joint Interoperability Test Command interoperability
and Net-Ready KPP certification.

H.2 Request for Proposal (RFP) Language
Sample RFP language is available from each DoD Component and applies to RFPs and contracts
intended to procure all information technology, including Platform IT (PIT) systems. The items
below are aligned with the structure of a typical solicitation, providing cybersecurity
considerations for each portion of the solicitation. The PM reviews and adjusts the language
used for solicitations to ensure alignment with the overall SSE goals and objectives and the
acquisition type.
A – Solicitation/contract form. No cybersecurity-specific information is anticipated in this
section.
B – Supplies or services and prices/costs. Review all CDRL deliverables for inclusion of
cybersecurity execution support (e.g., data rights, test data, test plans, source code
deliveries, prototype quantity, and delivery times/location).
C – Description/Specifications/Statement of Work.
•
•

•
•

Clearly define, and state in performance-based terms directly tied to program objectives,
all cybersecurity requirements levied on the contractor.
Include cybersecurity system/technical requirements in the system/technical requirements
document (SRD/TRD). If requiring the contracted developer to define the formal
technical requirements in a system/item performance specification, add that technical
requirements definition work task to the SOW/SOO and reference a system/item
performance specification data deliverable in an associated CDRL. Provide the list of
applicable security controls (after initial tailoring), with the understanding that they will
be further tailored during system development.
Identify the categorization of the system, including overlays. This includes listing the
applicable controls that will inform the developer’s security requirements and design the
contractor is required to implement and assess, to meet requirements.
Ensure all CDRLs adequately address cybersecurity execution support (e.g., data rights,
test data, test plans, source code deliveries, prototype quantity, and delivery times and
location).

105

•

Identify any specific design, contractor testing, or contractor artifacts that enable meeting
the cybersecurity requirements based on system categorization, applicable RMF controls,
and which controls the contractor will be authorized to assess.

D – Packaging and marking. No cybersecurity-specific information is anticipated in this
section.
E – Inspection and acceptance. Ensure the acquisition team has developed a tailored quality
assurance surveillance plan to monitor contractor performance. This may include
cybersecurity considerations.
F – Deliveries or performance. Ensure cybersecurity-related items are addressed as any other
type of requirement would be, for example:
Identify the required number (sample size) of test articles.
Establish a delivery location for test articles along with schedule.
Identify contractor-acquired property.
Identify PM’s desire to have contractor support personnel available to repair or
provide reachback for the contractor’s product during cybersecurity effort.
o Identify contractor property needed as spares during the testing.

o
o
o
o

G – Contract administration data. No cybersecurity-specific information is anticipated in this
section.
H – Special contract requirements.
List applicable cybersecurity special contract
requirements (e.g., handling of data, software license management, and maintenance).
o If there is a desire to use contractor facilities for cybersecurity initial testing, state
that need in the solicitation and resulting contract.
I – Contract clauses. Cybersecurity-specific contract clauses should be considered (e.g., the
DFARS clause: Safeguarding Unclassified Controlled Technical Information).
J – List of Attachments. Applicable cybersecurity attachments should be considered (e.g., a
DoD Component RMF Guide).
K – Representations, Certifications, and Other Statements of Offerors or Respondents.
Include requests for certifications that support the cybersecurity strategy (e.g., NSA
certifications of cryptographic algorithms or equipment, and certification of cross domain
solutions).
L – Instructions, Conditions, and Notices to Offerors or Respondents.
• Describe the contractor management structure for cybersecurity (e.g., the experience of
cybersecurity staff, predicted staffing levels, and the application of cybersecurity best
practices and its alignment with the contractor management structure for SSE and T&E).

106

•

•

•

•
•
•

Define the contractor’s responsibilities for cybersecurity and the alignment of those
responsibilities in contrast to the government for required SSE and T&E activities (e.g.,
contractor cybersecurity testing, developmental testing, and integrated testing).
Describe the contractor’s approach for technical data, including management, ownership,
control, timely access, and delivery of all cybersecurity data, including raw test data, to
support the evolving technical baseline.

Annex J - Training
A variety of training resources are available to support the program manager (PM) and the PM’s
team in understanding and integrating cybersecurity, the risk management framework (RMF),
and related topics. PMs need to ensure that personnel with cybersecurity responsibilities
implementing RMF are properly trained in their job roles. This annex provides some key
information about the training resources available.

J.1 DoD Risk Management Framework (RMF) Training
J.1.1

DISA Training

The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is responsible for the Department of Defense
(DoD)-wide RMF training program and has developed two high-level introductory training
modules 57. The purpose and goal of these two training modules are to inform learners about
organizational and individual responsibilities in regard to DoDI 8500.01 and DoDI 8510.01. The
primary target audience is all DoD personnel involved in DoD cybersecurity and DoD IT risk
management. Instructionally, the training modules assume that the audience may have limited
knowledge of the subject matter.
The modules introduce concepts of cybersecurity and overarching guidance on how to manage
risks to information and information systems under the DoD RMF in order to operate approved
systems. They also provide the guidance and references necessary to support a successful
cybersecurity program under the new RMF policies.
The DISA training modules are posted on the Information Assurance Support Environment
(IASE) portal at http://iase.disa.mil/rmf/rmf-training.html. The RMF training modules have also
been taped by an instructor and will be posted once they are approved by the public affairs office
and the closed captioning is finalized. The instructor-led Defense Connect Online course will be
approximately three to four hours in length.
While not required, it is recommended that PMs attend the high-level RMF training to gain an
understanding of the RMF process as it applies to DoD IT and PIT.
Another RMF high-level introductory training opportunity
https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=693410&lang=en-US or

is

available

at

https://dap.dau.mil/daustream/Pages/AssetList.aspx?Asset-id=2070318.
This recorded briefing by the Chief of Cybersecurity Joint Information Environment Integration
& Compliance, Deputy Chief Information Officer for Cybersecurity, Cybersecurity
Implementation & Integration Directorate discusses:
•
•
57

Why DoD is transitioning from the traditional DIACAP to a new six-step RMF for IT
RMF overview and applicability within DoD

Additional courses are planned.

125

•
•

Alignment of DoD with the risk management approach of other Federal Agencies
Timelines for implementation

The 90-minute briefing was originally given on 15 January 2014 at a Defense Acquisition
University (DAU) Hot Topic Forum. The associated slides are also posted on the above DAU
site.
DISA is also currently developing a new authorizing official RMF training course (two to three
hours) that will replace the old DAA DIACAP course. This computer-based training (CBT)
course should be available in the fall of 2014.
DISA’s IASE is a “one-stop-shop” for education, training, and awareness in information
assurance and cybersecurity. The site offers training materials and hosts an online classroom
offering courses. The IASE can be accessed at http://iase.disa.mil/index2.html.
J.1.2

Defense Acquisition University (DAU) Continuous Learning Modules

CLE 074 – Cybersecurity throughout DoD Acquisition
This is the primary module for PMs to learn about cybersecurity and RMF. This five-hour
module provides the foundational knowledge PMs and other acquisition professionals need.
This information includes basic cybersecurity concepts, why it is important to integrate
cybersecurity into the acquisition process, and the process used to integrate key cybersecurity
activities into acquisition.
CLE 012 – DoD Open Systems Architecture
Designed for PMs, this two-hour module introduces DoD open systems architecture (OSA),
explains OSA principles from a business and a technical perspective, and provides examples of
successfully implemented OSA programs, as well as sources that can assist an organization in
implementing OSA.
CLE 022 – Program Managers Introduction to Anti-Tamper
This three-hour module introduces the PM to the steps involved in integrating anti-tamper into a
program or project to protect DoD critical program information (CPI). The student will learn the
importance of anti-tamper, the threats to critical DoD technology, current DoD initiatives and
programs designed to mitigate threats, how to plan for effective use of anti-tamper, and how antitamper can be effectively integrated into the overall program.
J.1.3

DAU Courses

DAU online course – IRM 101 – Basic Information Systems Acquisition
Within the framework of a program office IPT, this 30-hour online course covers introductorylevel concepts in DoD information systems and software acquisition management. Key areas
covered include DoD regulatory and technical frameworks, common software risks, software and
system architectures, information assurance, lifecycle reviews, and software development and
integration processes.
126

IRM 202 – Intermediate Information Systems Acquisition
This two-week classroom course focuses on the application of DoD policies, concepts, and best
practices for the management and acquisition of software-intensive and IT systems. Exercises,
lectures, group discussion, and labs are used to cover topics ranging from strategic planning,
cybersecurity, architectures, advancing technologies, requirements management, cost estimation,
metrics, process maturity, quality, and testing, among other areas.

J.2 Other DoD Training Resources
Further information and training material for PMs and their support staff will be available via the
DAG, Chapter 7 (https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=511590), DAU Continuous
Learning Module (https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=18914), and DoD SE
guidance (http://www.acq.osd.mil/se). Transition information for cybersecurity professionals is
available on the RMF Knowledge Service (https://rmfks.osd.mil/).
The DoD Systems Engineering/Systems Analysis office has developed training materials that
will be incorporated into courses offered by the DAU, as well as some continuing education
courses periodically offered through private industry and professional organizations. Check the
DoD Systems Engineering website (http://www.acq.osd.mil/se/) for the latest information,
contacts, and news about upcoming events.

J.3 Non-DoD Cybersecurity Training Open to DoD Personnel
NIST offers a two-hour CBT course titled Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal
Information Systems (http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/fisma/rmf-training.html). Even though
this is a NIST-developed course, it is beneficial to DoD personnel since DoD RMF policies are
heavily dependent upon NIST guidance.
The purpose of this course is to provide individuals new to risk management with an overview of
a methodology for managing organizational risk—the RMF. This course describes at a high
level the importance of establishing an organization-wide risk management program, the
information security legislation related to organizational risk management, the steps in the RMF,
and the NIST publications related to each step.

Annex L - Other Cybersecurity Considerations
Annex L includes five key sections:
1. Risk Management Framework (RMF) Background Information
2. Cross Domain Solutions (CDS) Information
3. Questions PMs Can Ask to Determine if Cybersecurity is Integrated into Defense
Acquisition Programs
4. Information Systems and IT Products
5. Platform IT (PIT) and PIT systems

L.1 Risk Management Framework Background Information
In 2006, the Chief Information Officers (CIO) of the Office of the Director of National
Intelligence (ODNI) and Department of Defense (DoD), as well as others, created a Certification
and Accreditation transformation activity to address problems with the government’s approach to
cybersecurity. The following problems were identified:
•
•
•
•
•

A compliance mindset was employed with regard to cybersecurity.
There was a heavy emphasis on paperwork, generally required every three years.
Different agencies and departments used different cybersecurity controls and processes.
Agencies did not accept each other’s certification results, resulting in lack of reciprocity
and wasted resources from redoing assessments that had already been done.
Some of the PIT examples were the responsibility of other program managers outside the
purview of the acquisition community.

DoD is moving to a risk-based approach to address these problems. Often, PMs did not
understand what they were required to do to implement effective cybersecurity. All of these
challenges needed to be addressed in a manner in which the DoD, intelligence community (IC),
and civil sector (represented by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST))
could all agree.
To address these problems, DoD and ODNI leadership agreed upon seven transformation goals:
1. Define a common set of impact levels; adopt and apply those levels across the federal
government.
2. Adopt reciprocity as the norm, enabling organizations to accept the approvals by others
without retesting or reviewing.
3. Define, document, and adopt common security controls.
4. Adopt a common security lexicon—providing a common language and common
understanding of terms.
5. Institute a senior risk executive function, which bases decisions on an “enterprise” view
of risk considering all factors, including mission, IT, budget, and security.
6. Incorporate information security into Enterprise Architectures and deliver security as a
common enterprise service across the federal government.
137

7. Enable a common process that incorporates information security within the lifecycle
processes and eliminates security-specific processes.
Three years later in 2009, DoD, ODNI, the Committee on National Security Systems, and NIST
established the Joint Transformational Task Force 58 and agreed to joint development of five core
documents, all of which have been published, although they continue to be revised and updated.

NIST SP 800-53, Revision 4, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information
Systems and Organizations, April 2013

Federal Information Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach, February 2010

Information Systems and Organizations: Building Effective Security Assessment Plans,
June 2010.

The replacement of the DoDI 8500.2 IA controls with the NIST SP 800-53 security controls is a
direct result of the transformation effort, especially transformation goal #3. This facilitates
moving the government from supporting multiple, disparate cybersecurity guidelines and
standards to a single unified framework. The adoption of the RMF process can be traced back to
transformation goal #7. The premise that the RMF activity should be risk based can be traced
back to transformation goal # 5.
The replacement of the DIACAP with the RMF is a significant milestone in moving the
government and DoD toward meeting some of the cybersecurity transformation goals. Other
goals could take several more years to be fully implemented.
This document explains the changes DoD is implementing to integrate cybersecurity into the
program acquisition lifecycle. PMs are asked to do the following:
•
•
•

Build cybersecurity capabilities into the design, development, acquisition, operations, and
sustainment of defense capabilities and systems.
Assess their programs for potential cybersecurity threats, vulnerabilities, and weaknesses
within a structured risk management framework.
Address cyber-related needs and concerns earlier in acquisition lifecycles before design
trades are made.

58

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has been positively impressed by this work (GAO publication 10-916,
Progress Made on Harmonizing Policies and Guidelines for National Security and Non-National Security Systems), noting that
“This harmonized security guidance is expected to result in less duplication of effort and more effective implementation of
controls across multiple interconnected systems.”

138

L.2 Cross Domain Solutions (CDS) Information
A CDS is a form of controlled interface that provides the ability to access or transfer information
manually or automatically between different security domains. While a CDS provides the ability
to share information across security domains, it also provides a level of protection for the
information and enclaves to which it connects.
A CDS is implemented as part of an information system or PIT system and is authorized under
the full RMF process. As stated in DoDI 8510.01, enclosure 6, authorizing officials must take
into consideration the security impact of the CDS operation when making an authorization
decision. The requirements for confidentiality and/or integrity of information being transferred
across security domains, and the ability of the CDS to meet those requirements, are critical to the
decision-making process.
Implementing a CDS introduces additional cybersecurity considerations and risks to the
connected enclaves and therefore requires additional scrutiny during assessment and
authorization processes. Authoritative guidance for CDS is provided in the following:
•
•

DoD Chief Information Officer and Intelligence Community Chief Information Officer
Memorandum, “Use of Unified Cross Domain Management Office (UCDMO) Baseline
Cross Domain Solutions (CDSs),” December 1, 2011
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 6211.02D, “Defense Information
Systems Network (DISN) Responsibilities,” January 24, 2012.

In response to the authorities outlined in the above documents, the UCDSMO developed
guidance to ensure that solutions implementing CDS protect the information and networks to
which they connect from compromise and disclosure. During the MSA phase of the acquisition
lifecycle, all systems that provide CDS should utilize the CDS Overlay (CNSSI No. 1253,
Appendix F, Attachment 3) when performing their control selection and tailoring. This will
ensure that the requirements critical to the implementation of a CDS are addressed.
The UCDSMO developed a Cross Domain Risk Model to categorize the threats and the risks to
NSS information and networks when implementing a CDS. The Cross Domain Risk Model
should be used when performing risk assessments of CDS throughout the entire acquisition
lifecycle and assessment and authorization processes.
Beyond the T&E performed by the program throughout the acquisition lifecycle, Chairman of
the Joint Chief of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 6211.02D, enclosure C, allocates responsibility for
performing CDS certification testing to DIA and NSA in accordance with UCDSMO guidance
and applicable DoD and IC assessment and authorization requirements. The UCDSMO
guidance for performing the certification testing is defined in the CDS Security Assessment
Process Guide. In addition, the UCDSMO’s Security Assessor’s Guide provides specific
guidance on how to test the security controls in terms of CDS. Both documents should be
utilized when a security assessment is performed on a CDS as part of the assessment and
authorization processes.

139

L.3 Questions Program Managers Can Ask to Determine if Cybersecurity is
Integrated into Defense Acquisition Programs
•

Is cybersecurity integrated into solution architectures and is it aligned with
enterprise/segment/reference architectures? (Chief Engineer/Lead Systems Engineer/SSE)

•

Early in the lifecycle during requirements and architecture definition and design, has the
developer and/or Chief Engineer/Lead Systems Engineer/SSE tried to model or assess the
mission impact of cyber incidents (i.e., estimating mission impact by comparing model
measures of effectiveness with and without the effects of different/evolving cyber attacks)?
Dynamic mission modeling allows for timing and duration information to differentiate
between attacks than can be recovered from quickly and attacks that take much longer. This
modeling will enable design and development of more attack-resistant systems that can
operate through cyber attacks and can also support operations with better, more targeted
responses to attacks. One example of the mission impact assessment is described in an
article in Modeling & Simulation Journal, “Evaluating the Impact of Cyber Attacks on
Missions,” Summer 2013, pages 25–35. The article refers to a large body of existing work,
tools, and techniques that address mission modeling. (Developer and/or Chief Engineer/Lead
Systems Engineer/SSE)

•

Did you appoint an ISSM (IA Manager under DIACAP) in writing? The ISSM is responsible
for establishing, implementing, and maintaining the cybersecurity program for the system
being acquired. The ISSM is also responsible for documenting the RMF authorization
process (formerly DIACAP), and chairing the Cybersecurity WIPT. (PM)

•

Did you establish a Cybersecurity WIPT during the MSA phase? The project members on the
Cybersecurity WIPT should have the systems expertise necessary to support the development
of the cybersecurity strategy (formerly the acquisition IA strategy). The Cybersecurity WIPT
should be chaired by the ISSM or designee and should consist of SMEs familiar with the
system being acquired, the intended use of the system, and the operational and system
architectures within which the system will function. As the operational and system views of
the architectures mature, the WIPT should conduct consultations into the principal systems
with which the system being acquired will interface. Consider Cybersecurity WIPT
membership from: the user community (e.g., user representative, requirements/resource
sponsor, Joint Staff); authorizing official staff (e.g., authorizing official designated
representative) (formerly DAA); SCA staff (formerly CA); OSD Cybersecurity RMF points
of contact in DoD CIO, DASD(SE) (if they have oversight), and DASD(DT&E) (if they have
oversight), System Threat Assessment Report representative, enterprise/segment/reference
and solution architecture representatives; and representatives from engineering/SE (including
program protection/SSE representative), acquisition, and the Chief Developmental Tester.
(PM)

•

Does the Cybersecurity Strategy describe:
o The overarching technical approach to secure the system by applying the RMF
throughout the acquisition lifecycle (and its subsequent implementation)

140

o How the program’s cybersecurity requirements are traced through the security controls
and into the acquisition baselines and system design
o How cybersecurity risk will be assessed and managed during the lifecycle
o Collaboration with the Authorizing Official to manage and maintain the system’s
cybersecurity risk posture
The PM develops the Cybersecurity Strategy. (Chief Engineer/Lead Systems Engineer/SSE,
Chief Developmental Tester [CDT], ISSM)
•

Is the Cybersecurity Strategy coordination maintained and configuration controlled with
other governing program documents (SEP, PPP, ISP, ICD/CDD/CPD/CONOPS/capability
requirements, Acquisition Strategy, RFPs)? The Acquisition Strategy should reference the
Cybersecurity Strategy and outline key cybersecurity considerations that will affect the
acquisition (including procurement), such as cybersecurity technical, cost, funding, staffing
and support considerations. The SEP should also identify cybersecurity as an important
design consideration and reference the Cybersecurity Strategy as a source for determining
requirements. The ISP also relies on the program’s Cybersecurity Strategy to determine
compliance with DoD information management policies and compliance with the Global
Information Grid architecture.
The Cybersecurity Strategy and RMF
assessment/authorization activities are aligned with the TEMP. (PM, Chief Engineer/Lead
Systems Engineer/SSE, ISSM and Chief Developmental Tester)

•

Have
the
Cybersecurity Strategy,
SEP,
TEMP,
PPP,
ISP,
ICD/CDD/
CPD/CONOPS/capability requirements, Acquisition Strategy, and RMF Security Plan
informed the RFP throughout the lifecycle? (Chief Engineer/Lead Systems Engineer, CDT,
ISSM, Engineering/Systems Engineering [including program protection/SSE representative],
Acquisition, T&E, and Cybersecurity WIPT leads)

•

Was preference given to the acquisition of COTS cybersecurity and cybersecurity-enabled
products, which have been evaluated and validated as appropriate, to be used on systems
entering, processing, storing, displaying, or transmitting national security information?
(ISSM)

•

Are current cybersecurity threats included in the PPP threat table? (Chief Engineer/Lead
Systems Engineer/SSE, ISSM)

•

Is cybersecurity included in the program budget? Cybersecurity should be included as an
identifiable line in the budget. When constructing the cybersecurity budget requirement,
consider cybersecurity staff and support costs, cybersecurity SE costs, cybersecurity
procurement costs, RMF authorization costs, cybersecurity T&E costs, and cybersecurity
maintenance costs (from responding to IAVAs, etc., to maintaining cybersecurity posture
during sustainment until decommissioning). Cybersecurity resources will require funding
through various types of appropriations, since cybersecurity is considered throughout the full
lifecycle of the program. For example, Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation funds
are required for the DT&E of a cybersecurity solution. Procurement funds are required for
141

procurement of cybersecurity solutions or tools. Operations and Maintenance funds are
required for the post-fielding operational maintenance of the cybersecurity posture, such as
IAVA fixes. (Chief Engineer/Lead Systems Engineer/SSE, CDT, Program Lead, Business
Financial Manager, Product Support Manager [Program Lead Logistician], Program Lead,
Cost Estimator)
•

After an ATO, is the system or information environment being continuously monitored
for cybersecurity-relevant events and configuration changes that negatively impact
cybersecurity posture, and are the quality of security controls implementation
periodically assessed against performance indicators such as cybersecurity incidents,
feedback from external inspection agencies, exercises, and operational evaluations? The
ISSM may recommend changes or improvement to the implementation of assigned
security controls, the assignment of additional security controls, or changes or
improvements to the design of the system itself. Site operations staff and the ISSM are
responsible for maintaining an acceptable level of residual risk. This is done by
addressing cybersecurity considerations when changes are made to either the security
controls baseline or to the baseline of the operational computing environment. The ISSM
is responsible for determining the extent to which a change affects the cybersecurity
posture of either the system or the computing environment, obtaining approval of
cybersecurity-relevant changes, and documenting the implementation of that change in
the Security Plan, POA&M, and site operating procedures. Continuous monitoring and
periodic reviews ensure the system continues to comply with the cybersecurity
requirements, current threat assessment, and CONOPS. Reviews are conducted at
intervals predefined in the system-level continuous monitoring strategy. (ISSM, SSE)

•

Is software authorized and the current approved version with cybersecurity patches and
service packs installed? These are common issues that lead to attacks and intrusions.
(ISSM)

L.4 Information Systems and IT Products
DoD information systems are authorized for operation through the full RMF process. Products
are not authorized through the RMF process. However, products must be securely configured in
accordance with applicable DoD policies and security controls and undergo special assessment
of their functional and security-related capabilities and deficiencies.
Products (including applications) are defined in DoDI 8500.01 as “individual IT hardware or
software items.” They can be commercial or government provided and can include, for example,
operating systems, office productivity software, firewalls, and routers.
Information systems are composed of IT products. Tables 9, 10, and 11 illustrate the relationship
between types of information systems and IT products.

142

points, network appliances, etc.
Servers, operating systems, productivity software, mobile code, mobile

devices, sensor agents, etc.

In the above examples, the IT system would go through the RMF process for an ultimate ATO
decision. The individual IT products undergo a cybersecurity assessment. These examples are
not to be construed as all-inclusive.
Products are configured in accordance with applicable Security Technical Implementation
Guides (STIGs) under a cognizant ISSM and SCA. STIGs are product-specific and documentapplicable DoD policies and security requirements, as well as best practices and configuration
guidelines. STIGs are associated with security controls through CCIs, which are decompositions
of NIST SP 800-53 (currently Revision 4) security controls into single, actionable, measurable
items. Security Requirements Guides (SRGs) are developed by DISA to provide general security
compliance guidelines and serve as source guidance documents for STIGs. When a STIG is not
available for a product, an SRG may be used. STIGs, SRGs, and CCIs are available on the IA
Support Environment website (http://iase.disa.mil). STIG and SRG compliance results for
products will be documented as security control assessment results within a product-level SAR
and reviewed by the responsible ISSM (under the direction of the authorizing official) prior to
acceptance or connection into an authorized computing environment (e.g., an IS or PIT system
with an authorization). This review is to ensure products will not introduce vulnerabilities that
the hosting IS cannot mitigate when incorporated or connected. DoD Component-level guidance
maximizes the acceptance and reuse of testing and review results for widely used products to
minimize duplication of effort across the DoD.

L.5 Platform Information Technology (PIT) and Platform Information Technology
Systems 59
Platform information technology (PIT) and PIT systems are depicted in Figure 18. PIT may
consist of both hardware and software that is physically part of, dedicated to, or essential in real
time to the mission performance of special-purpose systems (i.e., platforms). PIT differs from

Programs should refer to the RMF Knowledge Service for the most up-to-date information on PIT.

144

products in that it is integral to a specific platform type as opposed to being used independently
or to support a range of capabilities (e.g., major applications or enclaves).
Owners of special-purpose platforms, in consultation with an authorizing official, may determine
that a collection of PIT rises to the level of a PIT system. PIT systems are analogous to enclaves
but are dedicated only to the platforms they support. PIT systems are designated as such by the
responsible OSD or DoD Component heads or their delegates and authorized by an authorizing
official specifically appointed to authorize PIT systems.

Figure 18. PIT and PIT Systems
All PIT has cybersecurity considerations, but PIT that does not rise to the level of a PIT system
is not authorized for operation through the full RMF process. However, cybersecurity
requirements are identified, tailored appropriately, and included in the acquisition, design,
development, DT&E and OT&E, integration, implementation, operation, upgrade, or
replacement of all DoD PIT. The ISSM (with the review and approval of the responsible
authorizing official) is responsible for ensuring all PIT has completed the appropriate evaluation
and configuration processes prior to incorporation into or connection to an IS or PIT system.
Interconnections between PIT systems and other PIT systems or DoD ISs are protected by
implementation of security controls on either the PIT system or the DoD IS. For PIT systems
that are stand-alone, assigned security control sets may be tailored as appropriate with the
approval of the authorizing official (e.g., network-related controls may be eliminated).
PIT may be categorized using CNSSI 1253, with the resultant security control baselines tailored
as needed. Otherwise, the specific cybersecurity needs of PIT are assessed on a case-by-case
basis and security controls applied as appropriate. As required for products, compliance results
for PIT should be documented as security control assessment results. These results are
documented within a PIT-level SAR and reviewed by the responsible ISSM (under the direction
of the authorizing official) prior to acceptance or connection to an authorized computing
environment (e.g., an IS or PIT system with authorization).
PIT systems may also include other PIT systems (systems-of systems-concept) as well as PIT.
Table 12 provides examples of PIT systems and associated PIT.

Background: Reference (a) provides DoD policy and the process for performing the RMF on
all DoD information technology (IT); however, Reference (a) leverages the policy and processes
in References (b) through (j). This example progresses through each of the RMF steps and tasks
as described in Reference (d). 60 The six RMF steps are as follows, and the tasks supporting each
step will be listed as each step is discussed below:
Step 1: Categorize System
Step 2: Select Security Controls
Step 3: Implement Security Controls

60

See the summary chart of the RMF steps and tasks in Appendix E of Reference (d).

147

Step 4: Assess Security Controls
Step 5: Authorize System
Step 6: Monitor Security Controls
The example system is an unmanned aerial bomber system, which is a type of PIT system. This
example was chosen because it offers the opportunity to examine less understood nuances of the
RMF as they apply to PIT systems. The example will not document every detail of the RMF
process, as the intent is simply to help program managers understand the fundamental concepts
of the RMF and get them started on each step/task. For example, tailoring is an important
concept for PIT systems. A few illustrative examples of such tailoring are provided. The
discussions below are intentionally concise and are provided for illustrative purposes. For a
more thorough discussion of each step/task, see Reference (d).
M.1.2 Step 1: Categorize System [per Reference (b)]:
Task 1-1. Security Categorization: Categorize the system and document the results of the
security categorization in the Security Plan.
Reference (b) states that security categorization is a two-step process:
1. Determine potential impact values for the information types processed, stored or
transmitted or protected by the system; and for the system.
2. Identify overlays that apply to the system and its operating environment to account for
additional factors (beyond impact) that influence the selection of security controls.
To categorize the system, you must understand the mission as well as the information types and
systems/networks used. The mission is to fly the unmanned aerial bombers to a target and drop
bombs to destroy those targets. To execute the mission, air tasking orders are issued using a
ground-based information system. The unmanned aerial bomber is remotely controlled and
operated using a ground-based system. The bomber includes IT components that are essential to
real time operation of the bomber itself – the IT is essential to loading air tasking orders, flying
the aircraft, guiding it to its target, commanding it to release bombs, etc. The following table
captures the impact values for each information type, which are rolled up into a high water mark
for a system categorization, and it indicates the information owner for each information type
used by the system.

Information Owner
(Rank/Grade, Name, Org/Office Symbol)

[intelligence community]
[weather agency]
[supply organization]
[personnel organization]
[mission owner]
[system owner]

The mission owner owns the air tasking order. The air tasking order is generated using various
information types, not all of which are actually owned by the mission owner or the system
owner. The mission owner, in some cases, might not even own all systems used to execute the
mission. As such, the program manager for the unmanned aerial bomber system must reach out
to each information owner to determine the level of protection required for the individual
information types.
Typical information types and their impact values are captured in Reference (g), and Reference
(h) explains the concept of and setting of impact values. The information types used by national
security systems may not be included in Reference (h); therefore, system owners and information
owners may consult Reference (g) to determine how to set impact values, and the may also
examine similar information types in Reference (h) in setting impact values for unique
information types.
The intelligence community owns intelligence information the mission owner needs, such as
where the targets are, if they’re on the move, and how close to friendly forces they are. For the
mission owner, the weather agency can predict the weather over the target on any given day,
with a certain level of accuracy that decreases as the projection period increases. Supply
organizations provide information on the availability of essential items, such as bombs and spare
parts used by the bomber. Personnel organizations advise on the availability and readiness of
key personnel, such as pilots (who fly the bomber from the ground) or maintenance personnel
who prepare the bomber for its missions. System information types refer to the information
necessary to operate the systems/networks (e.g., router tables, firewall rules, system
configurations) and that must be protected, possibly to the highest level of the information
processed by the system.
The impact values for each information type are expressed as low, moderate, or high for each
security objective of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The system categorization is a
high water mark across information types, but not across security objectives. The distinct impact
values (low, moderate, or high) to C-I-A for each information type are included in the Initial
Capabilities Document (ICD) or Problem Statement. These information type impact values are
constraints to each of the alternatives studied in the AoA. System categorization information
may be captured in a template available on the RMF Knowledge Service at:
https://rmfks.osd.mil/. This template helps program managers ensure all information types are
identified and coordinated with the appropriate information owners. It may also be used to
provide evidence to the Authorizing Official (AO) that program managers reached out to each
information owner; signatures may be obtained from each information owner who coordinates on
a “categorization memo” to the AO.
The system categorization must be documented in the system’s Security Plan, which will be
approved by the AO.
The system categorization is also part of the Cyber
Survivability/cybersecurity requirements of the System Survivability KPP documented in the
Capability Development Document (CDD)/Capability Production Document/equivalent
capability requirements document. It is advisable for program managers to get an early AO
approval of the categorization, as it drives all other activities in the RMF process. Categorizing
the system too high potentially wastes resources, and categorizing the system too low does not
adequately protect the information and jeopardizes the mission.
149

All overlays that are applicable must be identified by the mission owner with support from the
PM at this point, but they are not yet applied (i.e., no security controls tailoring takes place at this
point based on the overlay specifications). Overlays are posted on the CNSS website at
https://www.cnss.gov/CNSS/index.cfm as attachments to Appendix F of Reference (b). Each
overlay includes a section to help determine the applicability of the overlay. The following table
indicates which of the available overlays are applicable to the unmanned aerial bomber system
(UABS).
Table 14. Applicable Overlays
Overlay Title

Applicable to UABS

Space Platform Overlay

No (but, command and control (C2) of UABS is similar
to C2 of space platforms)

Cross Domain Solution (CDS) Possibly (depends on system design choices)
Overlay
Intelligence Overlay

Yes (assuming certain system design choices)

Classified Information Overlay

Yes

NOTE: NIST SP 800-82 Industrial Control Systems Security Guide Appendix G ICS Overlay
should be used to address the supporting infrastructure (utilities, life safety and security systems,
airfield and pier systems, etc.) required for the UABS mission support.

Following are examples of the tailoring of controls recommended by the overlays and the
rationale for doing so. No examples are included from the Intelligence Overlay, because they are
all For Official Use Only (FOUO). Again, the relevance of each recommendation below
depends on the architecture of the system, and where the information types flow. For example,
the bomber may not require security controls related to the CDS, if the architecture places that
cross domain function solely within the ground systems. Conversely, the examples under the
Space Platform Overlay likely apply to the bomber, but “bomber” could be substituted for “space
platform” in most places below.

Space Supplemental Guidance: Audit review and reduction is not performed directly
on the space platform; rather, it is performed on audit data off-loaded to the ground
segment. Reduction of audit data may occur on the space platform within the
telemetry stream between the space platform and the ground. During anomaly
resolution, this audit data can be modified to delve into specific points of interest
within the space platform to aid in determining, identifying, and correcting system
failures.

ICS Overlay Examples:
PE-3, Physical Access Control
ICS Supplemental Guidance: The organization considers ICS safety and security
interdependencies. The organization considers access requirements in emergency
situations. During an emergency-related event, the organization may restrict access
to ICS facilities and assets to authorized individuals only. ICS are often constructed
of devices that either do not have or cannot use comprehensive access control
capabilities due to time-restrictive safety constraints. Physical access controls and
defense-in-depth measures are used by the organization when necessary and possible
to supplement ICS security when electronic mechanisms are unable to fulfill the
security requirements of the organization’s security plan. Primary nodes, distribution
closets, and mechanical/electrical rooms should be locked and require key or
electronic access control and incorporate intrusion detection sensors.
PE-11, Emergency Power
ICS Supplemental Guidance: Emergency power production, transmission, and
distribution systems are a type of ICS that are required to meet extremely high
performance specifications. The systems are governed by international, national,
state, and local building codes, must be tested on a continual basis, and must be
repaired and placed back into operations within a short period of time. Traditionally,
emergency power has been provided by generators for short to mid-term power
(typically for fire and life safety systems, some IT load, and evacuation transport) and
uninterruptible power supply battery packs in distribution closets and within work
areas to allow some level of business continuity and for the orderly shutdown of nonessential IT and facility systems. Traditional emergency power systems typically are
off-line until a loss of power occurs and are typically on a separate network and
control system specific to the facility they support. New methods of energy
generation and storage (e.g., solar voltaic, geothermal, flywheel, microgrid,
distributed energy) that have a real-time demand and storage connection to local
utilities or cross connected to multiple facilities should be carefully analyzed to
ensure that the power can meet the load and signal quality without disruption of
mission essential functions.
Control Enhancement: (1) No ICS Supplemental Guidance.
Rationale for adding control to baseline: ICS may support critical activities which
will be needed for safety and reliability even in the absence of reliable power from
the public grid.

Cross Domain Solution Overlay Examples:
AC-4, Information Flow Enforcement
CDS Supplemental Guidance: Apply flow control to data transferred between
security domains by means of a set of hardware and/or software collectively known
as the “filter”. Flow control includes the inspection sanitization, and/or rejection of
data from one security domain prior to transfer of data to a different security domain.
For an access CDS, the remote desktop architecture provides the capability for a user
to have access from a single device to computing platforms, applications, or data
residing on multiple different security domains; while preventing any information
flow between the different security domains.
AC-6, Least Privilege
CDS Supplemental Guidance: The principle of least privilege for CDS extends to the
sanitization of data prior to processing subsequent data transfers destined for a
different security domain, thus precluding inadvertent access. Additionally, processes
running on the CDS are not allowed access to the network if the access is not
explicitly required for functionality, (e.g., a firewall is used to control access to and
from the CDS).
Classified Information Overlay Examples:
AU-12, Audit Generation
Justification to Select: EO 13587 requires the establishment of an insider threat
program for deterring, detecting, and mitigating insider threats, including the
safeguarding of classified information from exploitation, compromise, or other
unauthorized disclosure. The White House Memorandum, National Insider Threat
Policy and Minimum Standards for Executive Branch Insider Threat Programs,
requires agencies to monitor and audit user activity on classified networks.
Generating audit records supports the detection of insider threat activities.
Regulatory/Statutory Reference(s): EO 13587, Sec 2.1(b) and Sec 5.2; White House
Memorandum, National Insider Threat Policy, Tab 1, Sec B.2(1) and Minimum
Standards for Executive Branch Insider Threat Programs, Tab 2, Sec H.1.
MP-4, Media Storage
Justification to Select: EO 13526 requires organizations to establish procedures and
controls to prevent access by unauthorized persons to classified information.
Physically controlling and securely storing media is necessary to protect the classified
information contained within the media.

153

Parameter Value: Physically controls and securely stores digital and non-digital
media containing classified information within an area and/or container approved for
processing and storing media based on the classification of the information contained
within the media.
Regulatory/Statutory Reference(s): EO 13526, Sec 4.1, para. (g); CNSSP No. 26.
Task 1-2. System Description: Describe the system (including system boundary) and document
the description in the security plan.
Descriptive information about the system is documented in the system identification section of
the SP, included in attachments to the plan, or referenced in other standard sources for
information generated as part of the system development lifecycle. Duplication of information is
avoided, whenever possible. The level of detail provided in the SP is typically commensurate
with the security categorization of the system. The RMF KS provides a template for the security
authorization package, which includes the SP. That SP template includes pre-defined fields the
program manager or representative (normally the ISSM) must fill in. A sampling of the fields in
the template follows:

Task 1-3. System Registration: Register the system with appropriate organizational
program/management offices (e.g. DoD Information Technology Portfolio Registry (DITPR),
EITDR).
All Air Force systems must be registered in the Air Force EITDR, and information systems must
be subsequently registered in the DITPR. In this example, the bomber itself is platform IT, but
the ground systems used to generate the air tasking orders and to fly the bomber are not
necessarily platform IT. As such, the overall system may need to be registered in EITDR and
DITPR. Program managers are advised to confer with their EITDR and DITPR points of contact
to determine if registration is required for which system components. A unique identifier is
associated with each EITDR or DITPR entry, and that identifier is included in the “System
Identification” field in the security plan. All Air Force systems must also be entered into
Enterprise Mission Assurance Support System (eMASS), which automates the RMF process
workflow, among other things. Other DoD Components may also require use of eMASS.
M.1.3 Risk Management Framework Step 2: Select Security Controls
Task 2-1. Common Control Identification: Identify the security controls that are provided by
the organization as common controls for organizational systems and document the controls in a
SP.
The unique environment within which the UABS operates and the corresponding architecture
drive which controls are common and can, therefore, be inherited by the system. The overall
UABS is designed within the context of that architecture, either to take advantage of existing
common controls or to avoid the risk imposed by interconnecting to systems/networks providing
common controls, but that ultimately have interconnectivity to the Internet, to which all threat
actors have access. The more unique the system, the less well it may fit within the typical
information system/network/enterprise architecture. The bomber is unique as compared to
typical information systems, but the supporting ground systems are very much like typical
information systems. However, the ground systems’ degree of separation from NIPRNet and
SIPRNet where common controls are provided may reduce the degree of inheritance of those
common controls and, thereby, increase the burden of developing and providing such controls
within the bomber and its supporting infrastructure.
In this example, for the bomber itself, the concept of a typical information system in a fixed
facility does not apply. As such, we must consider which controls or families of controls can be
tailored out before we can determine which controls remain and, of those, which can be inherited
from a common control provider. For example, while the bomber is on the ground, it can inherit
the protection from security controls such as: the base perimeter fence, gates, and guards; basewide security patrols from the Security Forces; flight line or hanger perimeter fences/structures,
outside lighting, and security patrols; fire detection/suppression in the hanger (not on the
bomber). But while the bomber is in flight, such ground-based concepts do not apply. However,
155

other forms of physical protection could apply, such as anti-tamper and/or cryptographic
zeroization, in case the bomber crashes in enemy territory and is seized by the enemy. Tailoring
of such controls is discussed below. Other inheritable controls may include cryptographic key
management infrastructure, bulk encryption of communications lines (those used to command
and control the bomber), and monitoring for and response to network-based attacks against any
of the IT used in or to communicate with the bomber. Potentially inheritable security controls
include, but are not limited to:

In this example, for the ground-based system components, the entire boundary protection suite
(firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, network account management and access
control, etc.) may be inherited from the hosting base enclave, assuming all stakeholders agree the
risk imposed by connecting to such base enclaves is acceptable (this is a risk-based design
decision based on systems security engineering (SSE), which is part of the standard systems
engineering (SE) process used during the acquisition lifecycle). The security capability
requirements (e.g., system survivability KPP cyber survivability and cybersecurity
requirements), CONOPS, mission threads, architecture design flows, and SSE risk assessments,
mitigations, and design trades drive the definition of security technical requirements included in
the technical configuration baselines: functional, allocated, and product. Security controls
(informally grouped into technical, management, and operational controls) map to technical
requirements in specifications (part of the functional, allocated, and product baselines), process,
and personnel requirements. Most of the physical and environmental controls are also inherited,
such as: base perimeter fence, gates, and guards; base-wide security patrols from the Security
Forces; facility perimeter fence, outside lighting, and security patrols; internal facility guards,
checkpoints, security cameras, intrusion detection systems, and alarm systems; facility fire
detection and suppression systems; facility temperature and humidity controls, awareness and
training, etc. Potentially inheritable security controls include, but are not limited to 61:

Most of the “dash-1” controls are inheritable, as they require policies and procedures most often developed by the organization, at a level
higher than the development, acquisition, or operating organizations.

people-oriented functions) are inheritable, such as those associated with establishing and
performing the security controls assessment and authorization of the system, and those
associated with maintaining the cybersecurity posture over time (i.e., monitoring and computer
network defense). Potentially inheritable security controls include, but are not limited to:

Task 2-2. Security Control Selection: Select the security controls for the system and document
the controls in the SP.
Reference (b) states that security control selection is a two-step process:
1. Select initial security control set (i.e., baseline controls with any selected overlays
applied).
2. Tailor initial security control set.
157

As described in Task 2-1, Common Control Identification, selection/tailoring is a risk- and
mission-based process enabled by SSE and SE.
The system categorization drives the baseline set of security controls from Reference (b). Given
there are three security objectives and each has three possible values, there are 27 possible
baselines. The CNSSI 1253 baselines were originally developed against a set of assumptions
that do not often apply to PIT systems or other non-information systems; therefore, significant
tailoring of security controls is necessary for the bomber, but not so much for the supporting
ground systems. Following are the assumptions from Reference (b), with notional indications of
which assumptions apply to each component of the UABS.

A baseline is simply a starting point, and tailoring of security controls is required for all systems.
The less the system aligns with the assumptions used to generate the baselines, the more tailoring
we must perform. Overlays are a form of bulk tailoring by a community who owns or has an
interest in the type of system, information, or environment. More importantly, the overlays
provide the rationale for selecting or de-selecting security controls, and that rationale is riskbased. As such, a risk assessment is necessary to determine if the UABS has (or will have, if not
yet developed) vulnerabilities that may be exploited by various threat sources. If the baseline
does not include security controls designed to mitigate the threat/vulnerability identified in the
risk assessment, the control is selected and applied beyond the baseline. Conversely, if the
baseline includes security controls designed to mitigate a threat/vulnerability the UABS does not
or will not suffer, the security control may be de-selected. Risk assessments are performed
during the system lifecycle at the times when the design maturity is assessed and a decision is
made that a design is ready to move to the next level elaboration (i.e., requirements definition to
159

system-level design to preliminary design to detailed design to implementation (e.g., fabrication,
coding, acquiring) to integration and test (verification and validation). These gates line up with
the Systems Engineering Technical Reviews (SETRs) and other program/technical reviews (e.g.,
System Requirements Review, System Functional Review, Preliminary Design Review, Critical
Design Review, Test Readiness Review, and System Verification Review).
It is mandatory to identify and use all appropriate overlays, but it is not mandatory to comply
precisely with all specifications in all overlays, as even the overlays were developed based on a
set of assumptions that may or may not apply to all systems using the overlay. That is, further
tailoring of the overlay specifications is often required; this is system-specific tailoring, and the
rationales for selecting or de-selecting the controls must be documented in the SP for
Authorizing Official (AO) approval. The PM and chief engineer ensure controls they document
in the SP map to technical requirements in specifications, process, and personnel requirements.
Again, these are risk-based decisions that require a risk assessment with evidence the AO uses to
make his or her decision.
In this example, the Classified Information Overlay is applicable, as intelligence information is
processed, and the air tasking orders are likely classified. The Intelligence Overlay may be
applicable, but possibly only to certain components of the systems. For example, the bomber
itself may not need to process intelligence information, but the component of the system that
ingests the intelligence information in order to create the air tasking order may need to apply the
Intelligence Overlay. Depending on the environment in which the system operates, the
corresponding architecture, and the design of the system (i.e., the interconnectivity selected), the
Cross Domain Solution (CDS) Overlay may be applicable. The design may be such that a CDS
(and its associated security controls) is avoided and instead an air gap is used. The bomber has
many similarities to an unmanned space platform, such as the means of commanding and
controlling the bomber, the hostile operating environment, the lack of normal identification and
authentication methods; therefore, the security control specifications in the Space Platform
Overlay may apply. To be clear, the overlay is not applicable, but the program manager may
leverage some content. Be sure to examine the risk-based rationale (tied to system
characteristics) for each security control selected or de-selected in the Space Platform Overlay to
determine if it can be leveraged in tailoring the bomber’s set of security controls.
Note that in this example, the program office may choose to pursue authorization of the bomber
separately from the supporting ground systems. In fact, the supporting ground systems may be
used to support multiple platforms; therefore, it may not be appropriate or advisable to establish
the authorization boundary around all types/families of unmanned aerial vehicles and all
supporting ground systems. Before the SP is drafted, PMs are advised to work with their AOs to
determine the appropriate authorization boundaries. Another factor to consider in setting
authorization boundaries is the size (and complexity) of the system authorized; too large, and
we’d be constantly updating the authorization package to respond to changes impacting risk; too
small, and it would be difficult to keep up with multiple packages and, more importantly, to
consistently manage risk across systems. For the bomber in this example, while it is in flight,
security controls associated with guns, gates, and guards; fire detection/suppression;
temperature/humidity control; locking screen savers (because there are no screens); etc. may be
tailored out, with a risk-based justification (i.e., the bomber does not suffer the

160

threat/vulnerability for which the control was designed to mitigate). Security controls for the
bomber that may be tailored out include, but are not limited to:

In addition to determining which security controls are not applicable to the bomber, we must also
determine which controls may be implemented differently due to the unique system design, use,
or operating environment. For example, it may be necessary to authenticate to the bomber in
order to command and control it, but the bomber does not have the typical user accounts, for
which the Identification and Authentication (IA) family of controls are designed. Therefore, the
basic intent of the IA Family can be met, albeit by alternate implementations appropriate for the
bomber. Security controls for the bomber in flight that may be implemented differently than
intended for typical information systems include, but are not limited to:
•
•
•
•

AC-17, Remote Access
AC-18, Wireless Access
AU-4, Audit Storage Capacity

•

IA-2, Identification and Authentication (Organizational Users)
IA-3, Device Identification and Authentication

PE-14, Temperature and Humidity Controls

Alternative implementations (to meet the intent) of the controls listed immediately above are
examples of mitigations to protect the system and information that would be identified as
mitigations to a SSE risk- and mission-based assessment of the system (including all
interconnected and interfaced systems, including mission planning and ground support, and data
flows).
Task 2-3. Monitoring Strategy: Develop a strategy for the continuous monitoring of security
control effectiveness and any proposed/actual changes to the system and its environment of
operation.
DoD will develop a continuous monitoring strategy per Reference (a) based on the concepts in
Reference (i). However, just as the security control baselines were designed to address a typical
information system, the DoD strategy will align with typical information systems. As such, the
UABS system owner must examine any DoD or DoD Component guidance to determine which
aspects require adjustment or specialized treatment in the UABS Information Security
Continuous Monitoring Strategy.
Any system-level continuous monitoring strategy must address the criticality, method (manual
vs. automated), and frequency of monitoring all security controls. The intent is to advise the AO
if a security control becomes non-compliant, or rather is ineffective in mitigating risk. The
strategy must address the reporting requirements and documentation provided to the AO, who
decides whether or not to modify the authorization decision (e.g., no change, ATO becomes
ATO with conditions, Denial of ATO).
It is necessary to draft the monitoring strategy at this point, as it quite possibly feeds the selection
of security controls, and vice versa. That is to say, if a control cannot be monitored over time to
determine effectiveness, there may be no need to implement the control, the control may need to
be implemented differently, or the risk must be mitigated via compensating controls.
Given the UABS is a PIT system, it is likely its monitoring strategy will be adjusted significantly
(compared to the DoD strategy, process, or guidance). For example, consider that most typical
systems rely heavily on a Computer Network Defense Service Provider (CNDSP) (to become
cybersecurity service provider) to monitor many of the technical security controls implemented
on or provided to (as common, inherited controls) the UABS. (NOTE: Many security controls
are designed solely to provide monitoring capabilities.) However, design decisions may dictate
that the UABS be isolated from those CNDSPs residing on NIPRNet and SIPRNet. As such, the
monitoring strategy must be aligned with the architecture of the supporting infrastructure and the
system design. Knowing how security controls can and will be monitored actually drives the
design of the system. If there are no available CNDSPs, the system or supporting infrastructure
must be designed and implemented to provide monitoring services.

162

The system-level continuous monitoring strategy must align with the cybersecurity DT&E and
OT&E sections of the Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP), which documents test and
evaluation of components, subsystems, and system level to verify security requirements in the
specifications and capability requirements document are met and assess system vulnerabilities in
a cyber threat environment. The TEMP will document plans for DoDI 5000.02-required
cybersecurity DT&E, 1) The DT&E program will support cybersecurity assessments and
authorization, including Risk Management Framework security controls, and 2) the Program
Manager and Operational Test Agency will conduct periodic cybersecurity risk assessments to
determine the appropriate Blue/Green/Red Team, and operational impact test events in alignment
with the overall test strategy for evaluating the program for real world effects. Also, DOT&E’s
Core Cybersecurity Compliance Metrics are directly related to security controls. The metrics are
the minimum compliance baseline to be verified during the cooperative vulnerability assessment
and penetration testing phase. OT&E is conducted to validate the operational effectiveness,
suitability, and survivability (including the cyber threat environment and cybersecurity).
Task 2-4. Security Plan Approval: Review and approve the security plan.
Program managers simply must engage with the AO early and often to ensure any assumptions
about risk, architecture, requirements, design, implementation, etc., are valid and up-to-date.
Failure to get agreement early on the SP jeopardizes the system’s cost, schedule, and
performance (i.e., it may not receive a timely ATO). The SP documents the categorization,
security control baseline, and tailoring of security controls. Given the security controls map to
system security requirements and system design, PMs ensure the AO (or designated
representative) is involved in the review of the acquisition documentation that includes relevant
cybersecurity information, and participates in SE/SSE/cybersecurity WIPTs, SETRs, and critical
milestone decisions. It is essential the AO understands and accepts the risk inherent in the
solution architecture, system requirements, and design to determine the derived corresponding
set of security controls is acceptable. The AO approves the PM-provided SP.
If the SP is changed throughout the system lifecycle (and that is very likely given the iterative
nature of system design for specialized systems), it is necessary to get another approval from the
AO. This point is particularly relevant to the UABS, as it is a PIT system that may struggle
through design iterations, as that design relates to presumed infrastructures, security
architectures, service providers, and so on that may or may not be available or appropriate.
M.1.4 Risk Management Framework Step 3: Implement Security Controls
Task 3-1. Security Control Implementation: Implement the security controls specified in the
security plan.
Security controls are not requirements in and of themselves. Security controls can be used to
derive actual system security requirements, which state more specifically the functions,
performance, and characteristics to protect the system and data, implement security features of
the architecture, and satisfy security capability requirements (e.g., system survivability cyber
resilience and cybersecurity requirements. As such, SSE is the critical to building cybersecurity
into the system. The item detail specifications, part of the initial product baseline at the CDR
SETR, is the build-to specification. The chief engineer and SSE contribute to development of
the item detail specification.
163

Given the UABS is a PIT system, standard solutions designed for typical information systems
may not be possible or appropriate for the UABS, particularly the bomber component. The
threat/vulnerability for which the original security control was designed is present (that’s why
the control was selected), but the UABS design necessitates a specialized design and
implementation of the control. If the SSE risk assessment confirms the architecture and design
are secure and pose low risk to the mission, the item detail specifications, when implemented and
integrated up to the system level, should result in a secure system and system performance
specification to be verified during system developmental T&E.
The previous example of how the pilot authenticates to the bomber is relevant here. For
example, the bomber may not have user accounts for authentication, but the means of
communication (e.g., dedicated point-to-point “wireless” link with encryption) may fulfill the
intent of identification and authentication security controls, in that only authorized pilots on the
ground in a protected facility on a UABS system component can talk to and fly the bomber.
Showing this tailored implementation, and more importantly the need to tailor, to the Security
Controls Assessor, to any oversight organizations, and ultimately the AO is crucial for PIT
systems, as they must understand how all risks (for which controls were selected) are actually
mitigated.
Task 3-2. Security Control Documentation: Document the security control implementation, as
appropriate, in the SP, providing a functional description of the control implementation
(including planned inputs, expected behavior, and expected outputs).
The SP is updated throughout the system’s lifecycle to document how the security controls are
actually implemented. The SP can either include the details of implementation (especially if
“standard,” well-known solutions are used – less explanation is needed) or reference existing
acquisition artifacts that provide those details. Given the unique nature of the UABS, it is likely
more appropriate to reference detailed system acquisition artifacts; however, to facilitate
assessments and authorization decisions, it is advisable to reference specific sections of existing
artifacts.
The mandatory security authorization package consists of the SP, the Security Assessment
Report (and inherently the Risk Assessment Report), and the Plan of Action and Milestones.
These are the high-level, RMF-specific artifacts. But, as discussed above, there are many other
artifacts (e.g., DT&E Assessment and OT&E report) that tend to prove the effectiveness of all
implemented security controls. Many of these artifacts are generated as part of normal system
acquisition/development, SSE, DT&E, and OT&E. To the maximum extent possible, leverage
existing artifacts. Reference those artifacts in the SP, which is approved by the AO, which
thereby implies those artifacts will be acceptable for assessments and for an authorization
decision. Following are examples of artifacts that may be leveraged:

M.1.5 Risk Management Framework Step 4: Assess Security Controls
Task 4-1. Assessment Preparation: Develop, review, and approve a plan to assess the security
controls.
For PIT systems like the UABS, the typical assessment procedures provided on the RMF
Knowledge Service may need to be tailored. This is so, because the more the implementation
was tailored, the more the assessment of the implementation will be unique to the system. If the
DoD assessment procedures are not appropriate, it may be beneficial to go back to the more
generic assessment procedures in Reference (j) for ideas on how the security control
implementation can be assessed.
The TEMP documents plans for 1) DT&E of components, subsystems, and system level to verify
security requirements in the specifications, 2) OT&E of the system to validate capability
requirements documents are met, 3) assessment of system vulnerabilities in a cyber threat
environment, among other cybersecurity objectives. The TEMP will document plans for DoDI
5000.02-required cybersecurity DT&E including vulnerability and adversarial cybersecurity test
165

and evaluation. The DT&E program will support cybersecurity assessments and authorization,
including Risk Management Framework security controls. The Program Manager and
Operational Test Agency will conduct periodic cybersecurity risk assessments to determine the
appropriate Blue/Green/Red Team, and operational impact test events in alignment with the
overall test strategy for evaluating the program for real world effects. Also, DOT&E’s Core
Cybersecurity Compliance Metrics are directly related to security controls. The metrics are the
minimum compliance baseline to be verified during the cooperative vulnerability assessment and
penetration testing phase. OT&E is conducted to validate the operational effectiveness,
suitability, and survivability (including the cyber threat environment and cybersecurity).
This example below of the DoD implementation guidance and assessment procedures reveals
how they may need to be tailored for the UABS, especially considering the notion of
“automatically compliant” – it assumes a certain infrastructure is in place. Consider also that the
bomber component of the UABS likely has size, weight, and performance constraints that may
not allow traditional cybersecurity solutions (e.g., robust audit trails) to be implemented.
Auditing is crucial to the monitoring capability, but if auditing cannot be implemented as
intended, compensating controls may be implemented. When the blue highlighted assignment
values are not specified in the DoD-specific assignment values (DSPAVs), the DoD Component
or the system owner must determine the appropriate values and correspond to performance
values in the specifications. Because this example security control is associated with monitoring,
it affects the continuous monitoring strategy, and as such the assignment values may influence
the monitoring frequency in the strategy. Note also that this example correlates to the need to
determine who or what provides the CNDSP services (i.e., what is meant by “The organization”
at the beginning of the control text), which is not a trivial task for the UABS, particularly the
bomber component.

provide standard identifiers and descriptions for each of the singular, actionable statements
comprising a security control or cybersecurity best practice. CCIs bridge the gap between highlevel policy expressions and low-level technical implementations. CCIs allow a security
requirement that is expressed in a high-level policy framework to be decomposed and explicitly
associated with the low-level security setting(s) that must be assessed to determine compliance
with the objectives of that specific security control. This ability to trace security requirements
from their origin (e.g., regulations, cybersecurity frameworks) to their low-level implementation
allows organizations to readily demonstrate compliance to multiple cybersecurity compliance
frameworks. CCIs also provide a means to objectively rollup and compare related compliance
assessment results across disparate technologies.
Below is an extract from Reference (j), which takes a different, more generic approach. Even so,
it too can provide ideas on how to assess this same example control.

Task 4-2. Security Control Assessment: Assess the security controls in accordance with the
assessment procedures defined in the security assessment plan.
The RMF’s intent is to integrate or synchronize the security assessment plan with the TEMP.
We cannot assess cybersecurity capabilities separately from other functionality, as a change to
one function to address a weakness may negatively impact another function. It must be a
comprehensive assessment, which is especially critical for PIT systems where the IT is essential
to real time operation of the platform. That is, if the IT (flight control system) fails on the
bomber, it crashes. No changes to the security controls implementation can be made without
considering the impact on the key functions of the bomber. As an extreme example,
implementation of a timeout on the session which connects the pilot to the bomber would be
catastrophic. Blindly implementing a timeout in response to an assessment indicating security
control AC-12, Session Termination, is not compliant will jeopardize the mission, not to mention
the safety and life of anyone under the bomber as it is crashing. Therefore, in developing the
system and the security assessment plan, alternate means of terminating no longer needed
“sessions” used to command and control the bomber must be designed, implemented, and
assessed accordingly – assessment plans must match the implementation.
Given how system-specific the assessment of security controls on the bomber may be, it is
advisable to ensure such assessments are incorporated into all phases of testing, to include
DT&E. It would be beneficial to make it clear to the Security Controls Assessor in the Security
Assessment Plan that the controls will be assessed iteratively during DT&E; however, the
program manager is expecting the Security Controls Assessor, or their “Agent,” to perform an
independent analysis. Independence is critical to this assessment, and the Security Controls
Assessor will indicate to all concerned what level of independence is required. The less
knowledge the Security Controls Assessors have about specialized systems (e.g., the UABS), the
more they may rely on DT&E to reveal weaknesses and simply perform an assessment on those
DT&E results. Again, coordinate early with the Security Controls Assessors to determine how
much any existing acquisition-based or SSE-based DT vulnerability and adversarial testing can
be leveraged for security controls assessments.
Task 4-3. Security Assessment Report: Prepare the security assessment report documenting the
issues, findings, and recommendations from the security control assessment.
This task is almost exclusively the responsibility of the Security Control Assessor; however, they
may choose to leverage existing test results; therefore, the program office may be involved in
preparing the report. Following are the fields included in the template for the security
authorization package, which includes the Security Assessment Report. Explanations of each
field are provided in that same template. A row is created in a spreadsheet to provide
information in each of these fields for every non-compliant security control. Program offices
170

should be prepared to assist the Security Control Assessor in filling out some of these fields, in
particular the NA justification and the recommendations for fixing the weakness.

The Security Control Assessor must perform a risk assessment of any non-compliant security
controls. Although Reference (a) is not very clear about this fact, the Security Control Assessor
must also prepare the Risk Assessment Report. But again, the assessor may not be familiar
enough with specialized systems or PIT systems, such as this UABS example. Because of their
deep knowledge of the system’s functions, the program manager and supporting staff (e.g.,
system engineer, systems security engineer, Information System Security Manager (ISSM)) may
need to work with the assessor on certain aspects of the Risk Assessment Report, such as
determining the likelihood of a threat source initiating a threat event (e.g., an attack) against a
vulnerability (e.g., a non-compliant security control) as well as the likelihood of success. And
assuming the program office has worked with the operating community, they may also be able to
advise the assessor of the mission impact due to any failure of the system (e.g., non-compliant
security controls). The program office may leverage existing, acquisition or generic (i.e., nonRMF) risk models; cybersecurity can be incorporated into those models. Following are
examples of how to capture and express the risk factors discussed above, and these examples
resemble many generic models. Reference (k) and the RMF Knowledge Service explain each
risk factor, how they are determined, and how they are used to generate a risk level.

In this UABS example, for the command and control “session” between the ground system and
the bomber, let’s assume security control AC-12 was selected, but it was not implemented;
therefore, the security control assessment reveals the control is non-compliant. The task at hand
is to determine the risk. The program office and the mission owner convey to the assessor that
the likelihood of a session being left open and unattended for an indefinite period of time is not
likely, as these “sessions” are initiated only while an air tasking order is being executed and the
bomber is flying. In fact, an entire crew on the ground is used to execute the mission, and it
would be intuitively obvious to the crew that the “session” was not gracefully terminated when
the bomber landed. As such, the likelihood of an attacker high jacking a latent, unattended
“session” is low (if not very low). If, however, the session was high jacked, the impact could be
catastrophic (i.e., very high), as it would allow the attacker to take control of the bomber, fly it to
a friendly target, and destroy that target. It may appear by plotting the likelihood and impact on
the chart above that the risk would be Moderate. But, consider that there are other mitigating
factors, such as the ability to shoot down the rogue bomber if the attacker in fact took control of
it. Therefore, in the final analysis, the risk of this particular threat/vulnerability is assessed to be
low. Such a risk is likely acceptable to the AO, but only if it can be shown how we arrived at the
risk level – show the details of the risk assessment.
Note that per Reference (a), if the risk of any non-compliant security control is High or Very
High, the authorization decision must be elevated to the DoD Component CIO. The CIO must
explicitly allow the AO to issue an authorization decision.
Task 4-4. Remediation Actions: Conduct initial remediation actions on security controls based
on the findings and recommendations of the security assessment report and reassess remediated
control(s), as appropriate.
For PIT systems such as this UABS example, IT is embedded and early design decisions may be
locked in, which may make it difficult to remediate any weaknesses identified during testing. As
such, it is important to consider an iterative testing approach, persuading the Security Control
Assessor to assess individual system components as they are being developed, so long as their
implementation is relatively fixed and will be incorporated into the larger system. In this
manner, early fixes are less impactful to the overall program cost, schedule, and performance.
This is the same approach in which DT&E assesses the system to identify
weaknesses/vulnerabilities, which should be appropriately mitigated via changes to the system
architecture, requirements, design, and/or implementation. If high-risk weaknesses are identified
during security control assessments, they must be addressed. Whether or not they can be
addressed before the final Security Assessment Report is developed is the concern here. If they
cannot be addressed, they become a POA&M entry with a certain risk level, which may not be
acceptable to the AO.
M.1.6 Risk Management Framework Step 5: Authorize Information System
Task 5-1. Plan of Action and Milestones: Prepare the RMF plan of action and milestones
(POA&M) based on the findings and recommendations of the security assessment report
excluding any remediation actions taken.

173

Preparation of the POA&M is not much different, if at all, for PIT systems, as compared to
information systems. Following is an extract from the template for the security authorization
package, which includes the POA&M.

Figure 19. DoD Plan of Action and Milestone
It is important to note that for PIT systems during the design and development of the system, it
may be prudent to draft the POA&M as soon as it is known that certain security controls cannot
be implemented, cannot be implemented as expected (as for typical information systems), or are
found to be non-compliant in early and often assessments, such that the design or
implementation can be changed early and the programmatic impacts to cost, schedule, and
performance can be minimized. The product baseline should be flexible for as long as possible
prior to implementation so the design can be assessed against the current cyber threat.
Assuming tight resource constraints or huge programmatic impacts, it is advisable to prioritize
entries in the POA&M based on the cybersecurity risk levels. That is, place up top/front the
most impactful or the most risky entries, in order to draw the attention of the AO, who may be
able to persuade those with funds to allocate them to cybersecurity fixes.
Also important is the need to clearly indicate what has been done to mitigate non-compliant
security controls and what could be done to further reduce the risk, with a clear indication of the
programmatic impacts, such that the AO understands what impact any authorization decision
may have to the program and to the mission. Again, because PIT systems are unique and the IT
is very closely tied to the functionality of the system and, therefore, mission success, the
POA&M is a key element in communications with the AO for appropriate and timely decisions.
Adjusting the “session” example above, let’s assume the residual risk of not implementing the
control was Moderate, which implies the weakness must be fixed at some point. If the POA&M
reflects that it is possible and affordable to implement the control as planned, but it cannot be
done until the next major release for the ground control component of the UABS (which is
scheduled for 6 months from now), and that funds have been requested and are likely to be
174

approved in 2 months, the AO may be inclined to issue an Authorization to Operate with
conditions, the conditions being that the control is implemented as specified in the POA&M.
Conversely, if the POA&M simply states that the control is non-compliant and no fix actions are
detailed, the AO is likely far less inclined to issue an Authorization to Operate, with or without
conditions. Again, communicating to the AO via the POA&M what has been done, is being
done, can be done, and will be done may be key. The POA&M is the program manager’s key
communication means to the AO.
Task 5-2. Security Authorization Package: Assemble the security authorization package and
submit the package to the AO for adjudication.
The security authorization package is essentially the same for PIT systems as it is for information
systems. The key is, however, to be sure each artifact (Security Plan, Security Assessment
Report, Risk Assessment Report, and POA&M) clearly conveys the uniqueness of the system,
any uniquely implemented security controls, any unique assessment of the controls, and the
follow-on plans to fix weaknesses deemed uniquely relevant based on the impact to the mission.
Given how specialized the UABS example is, and assuming the AO is not familiar with the
nuances of the system, it may be appropriate to include (or make available, possibly via eMASS)
with the security authorization package any and all system artifacts (discussed above) for
reference by the AO, should they have questions about the risk, assessments, implementation, or
design decisions. Making these artifacts readily available can shorten the staffing time for
packages and can convey due diligence on the part of the program office. No availability of
artifacts can be misconstrued as those artifacts not having been prepared, when in reality due
diligence was done and the artifacts were developed and are thorough.
Task 5-3. Risk Determination: Determine the risk to organizational operations (including
mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations,
or the Nation.
This task is performed partly by the Security Control Assessor (possibly with some input from
the program office) and partly by the AO. The more generic the Security Control Assessor is,
the less likely they are to be able to know and understand the implications of certain aspects of
the UABS (especially the bomber component), as to how they will impact mission operations.
On the other hand, the presumption is that the AO was assigned due to their understanding of the
mission and how any systems support that mission. If they are not completely familiar with the
mission, in making risk determinations the AO should reach out to the mission owners for input
on the risk determination, and the following risk acceptance decision. This is especially relevant
in the UABS example. In fact, some DoD Components, particularly the Air Force in this
example, have assigned specialized AOs (e.g., an Aircraft AO). In that construct, the Air Force
also chose to assign specialized Security Control Assessors who are equally familiar with the
aircraft systems and the cybersecurity implications; however, they may not be as familiar with
the mission implications. Regardless, risk determinations are not made in a vacuum; program
offices should be prepared to participate.
Task 5-4. Risk Acceptance: Determine if the risk to organizational operations, organizational
assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation is acceptable.
175

This is exclusively the role of the AO; however, as discussed above, they rely heavily on inputs
from various sources. So again, the program office must be very clear in their communications
to the AO, in particular in the POA&M.
M.1.7 Risk Management Framework Step 6: Monitor Security Controls
Task 6-1. System and Environment Changes: Determine the security impact of proposed or
actual changes to the system and its environment of operation.
The system-level Information Security Continuous Monitoring Strategy was developed in Step 2
in anticipation of the need to monitor security controls over time. One of the components of that
strategy must address intentional and unintentional changes to a system, and that is often
executed by implementing several security controls in the configuration management family,
such as:
•
•

CM-3, Configuration Change Control
CM-4, Security Impact Analysis

While the development/acquisition program office must have designed the system and
procedures to allow such configuration management, much of the follow-on work here is
performed by the sustainment program office, and the operational community for that matter,
unless the acquisition PM is assigned lifecycle management responsibility.
Not all changes that could increase risk to the mission are related to configuration of the
technical components of the system. In this UABS example, the bomber was designed to satisfy
a certain capability need. Assumptions may have been made about the environment in which the
bomber will fly (e.g., high altitude out of the range of enemy surface-to-air missiles), but those
assumptions are not always valid over time. Enemy capabilities can increase, such as developing
missiles with a greater range or higher ceiling of operation, or developing improved methods of
cracking cryptographic algorithms used in the communication with the bomber to command and
control it. The bomber (or the means of communicating with the bomber) may need to be
redesigned for higher flight or redesigned with countermeasures to counter increased enemy
capability. The implication is that the development/acquisition program office must consider
design options (e.g., relatively autonomous components) that will allow the system to be costeffectively upgraded to address new threats.
As to which changes may impact risk, the measuring stick is not “minor change” vs. “major
change.” The bottom line is that ANY change to the system must be examined from a
cybersecurity perspective to determine if the change weakens the cybersecurity posture, thereby
creating new opportunities in cyberspace for the enemy to exploit the system. The rule of thumb
is that if the change is to a component that implements a security control, a security control
assessment must be performed on that component to determine the continued effectiveness of the
control/s. But, other factors or interrelationships between components may drive the need to
assess the entire system. Especially for highly specialized systems, such as this UABS example
where proper functioning of the IT components are critical to the operation of the bomber (i.e.,
mission success), it is prudent to work closely with the Security Control Assessor to determine
which proposed or actual changes may negatively impact the risk and, therefore, require an
assessment and possibly a new authorization decision.
176

Task 6-2. Ongoing Security Control Assessments: Assess a selected subset of the technical,
management, and operational security controls employed within and inherited by the information
system in accordance with the organization-defined monitoring strategy.
Selection of the subset of controls to be assessed over time is based on the criticality of the
controls to the functioning of the system in question. That is, the more critical the function, the
more frequently the controls supporting that function should be assessed. In this UABS
example, the encryption of C2 links with the bomber are more critical than such things as
whether or not the pilot has done the annual cybersecurity training or whether or not the
maintenance crew inappropriately used remote access to update a software application on the
bomber (while it was on the ground). But, we can see that these seemingly less important
functions can, through a daisy chain effect, lead to more catastrophic failures. For example, if
the remote access link was unknowingly compromised, an enemy could monitor the session,
determine how/when changes are made, and either highjack the session or later pose as the
authorized maintainer and upload software that provides unfettered access to and control of the
bomber, at their time of choosing (e.g., when the United States chooses to bomb that enemy’s
assets).
This security control assessments should leverage the DOT&E cybersecurity assessments of
system effectiveness and any existing vulnerabilities based on the current environment, including
threat.
Therefore, we must fully understand how each security control supports the function of the
system, examine the relationships between security controls, and determine how frequently each
must be monitored. These relationships can be understood by examining the original traceability
of security controls to system security requirements to implementation; we understand
potentially how critical each control is to the system’s functions and, therefore, to the mission.
Task 6-3. Ongoing Remediation Actions: Conduct remediation actions based on the results of
ongoing monitoring activities, assessment of risk, and outstanding items in the POA&M.
This task is not much different from the actions taken by the program office to address noncompliant security controls found during the initial security control assessment, which are
documented in the POA&M. However, because the system is in operation and the risk to the
mission may not be acceptable, the program office may not have much time to resolve the
weaknesses. The implication is that the sustainment program office must anticipate and program
for the funds addressing any new weaknesses over the entire system lifecycle. In this UABS
example, this aspect is critical; as it is likely the mission owner cannot tolerate the loss of such a
capability.
The mission owner and the AO must strike a balance between the continued need for the
capability (i.e., bomb selected targets) and the assurance to all stakeholders that the capability
will not be lost or compromised due to cybersecurity weaknesses. The mission owner may be
willing to continue operations at risk, but they may not fully understand or appreciate the risks.
Those with cybersecurity responsibilities must be able to convey if/how enemies may exploit
cybersecurity weaknesses and turn the bomber back on the mission owner or other friendly

177

entities. Seemingly benign or misunderstood cybersecurity weaknesses can have catastrophic
effects for PIT systems.
Task 6-4. Key Updates: Update the security plan, security assessment report, and plan of action
and milestones based on the results of the continuous monitoring process.
These documents are crucial in capturing and communicating to all concerned the cybersecurity
posture of the system (i.e., risk) and what can be done, is being done, or will be done to correct
any discrepancies and reduce the risk to an acceptable level. If these documents do not reflect
reality over time, all stakeholders are left with a false sense of security and make inappropriate
decisions, such as to continue operation of a UABS that has been compromised (e.g., by an
advanced persistent threat actor) and can at any time be turned against friendly forces.
Task 6-5. Security Status Reporting: Report the security status of the system (including the
effectiveness of security controls employed within and inherited by the system) to the
authorizing official and other appropriate organizational officials on an ongoing basis in
accordance with the monitoring strategy.
DOT&E annually reports cybersecurity assessments of system effectiveness and any existing
vulnerabilities based on the current environment, including threat.
As with the previous tasks, failure to report the security status will over time lead to undesirable
consequences, up to and including bombing of friendly forces. All stakeholders simply must
have current and correct information about the cybersecurity posture of the system to make
informed decisions about the use of the system. They must have assurance the UABS has not
been compromised, will not be compromised (to a certain degree of certainty), and will continue
to perform its function in support of whatever mission it supports. Again, due to the integration
of the IT into the basic function of the system and the potential for automated decisions, security
status reporting is more critical for PIT systems than for typical information systems, where there
is “wetware” (human brains) between the hardware/software and the execution of some mission.
Task 6-6. Ongoing Risk Determination and Acceptance: Review the reported security status
of the system (including the effectiveness of security controls employed within and inherited by
the system) on an ongoing basis in accordance with the monitoring strategy to determine whether
the risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or
the Nation remains acceptable.
This task is performed exclusively by an AO; but again, others (e.g., the program office) must
clearly convey, in a timely manner, the information used to make these decisions. The more
critical the IT is to the function of the system and the mission (e.g., this UABS example), the
more the other stakeholders are involved in providing information to the decision makers.
In this UABS example, the mission owner may fully understand and appreciate that the enemy
may have procured the ability to crack the crypto algorithms used to protect only the air tasking
order. In other words, the enemy may know the bomber is coming to destroy them. However,
the mission owner may be able to convince the AO not to rescind the Authorization to Operate,
because it can be shown that knowing the bomber is coming simply reduces the likelihood that
the enemy target will still be there when the bomber shows up. That is, the effectiveness of the
178

bomber is reduced, not eliminated completely. Note that the effective life of the air tasking order
is very short, as compared to other information types. The mission owner may be willing to
tolerate a degradation of capability, at least for a short time until the encryption algorithms
protecting that information can be improved such that the enemy cannot crack them.
Task 6-7. Information System Removal and Decommissioning: Implement a system
decommissioning strategy, when needed, which executes required actions when a system is
removed from service.
In this UABS example, it may be very straightforward and simple to decommission the bomber,
but not necessarily the supporting ground systems, if those ground systems are highly
interconnected and are being relied upon for inherited security controls. However, caution must
be taken to, for example, remove and/or sanitize all sensitive or classified information or
equipment (e.g., crypto algorithms/devices or all IT components) from the bomber before it is
sent to the aircraft boneyard in the Southwest or to a museum.
For ground systems providing common controls to other unmanned aircraft or other groundbased systems, much coordination is required to gracefully terminate any service level
agreements. Imagine how catastrophic it could be if the audit reduction and analysis function
being performed by the system you are decommissioning was terminated, unbeknownst to other
aircraft system or mission owners. Low and slow attacks (previously identified through audit
reduction and analysis) could go unnoticed over time, the aircraft could be compromised, and the
weapons of mass destruction could be turned against friendly forces at the enemy’s time of
choosing.

M.2 Example 2 – Practical Automobile Example
This is a notional example to illustrate how to incorporate cybersecurity into a program from the
requirements stage through deployment.
M.2.1 The Requirement
Assume you have a requirement to get from your house to the mall and back, a distance of about
20 miles round trip. You need to get there safely, quickly, hopefully without getting too cold/hot
or wet, while minimizing expense. You need to do this on a regular basis, and your decision
must remain in place for several years.
M.2.2 Material Solution Analysis Phase
To decide the best way to accomplish this task, you come up with 3 alternatives – using a
bicycle, a motorcycle, and a car. Among your evaluation criteria are speed, payload capacity,
expense, availability, resistance to persistent threats (i.e., things that can prevent you from
getting to the mall safely and quickly), and resilience when threats become issues (e.g. use of
countermeasures or existence of a fallback plan). For the purposes of this example, we will focus
on the resistance to threats by means of a metric. As part of your AoA team, you have a Red
Team (a friendly force acting as an aggressor to maximize resiliency) doing a
tabletop/brainstorming session about things that could stop you getting safely to the mall. Some
ideas they come up with are a traffic accident, flat tire, weather, theft, traffic lights, getting lost,
getting locked out, or engine break down.
VULNERABILITY/IMPACT ANALYSIS – FOR EACH ALTERNATIVE: During this analysis
you quickly conclude that the bicycle has some pretty serious impacts that extend beyond your
risk tolerance, because in a traffic accident you could die or be seriously injured, flat tire or theft
will leave you walking, bad weather could be hazardous, and it will take a long time and your
engine is likely to break down (i.e., a 20 mile bike ride is tiring). The motorcycle is better, but it
is vulnerable in a traffic accident and in bad weather. The car better addresses those concerns
(you are better protected in an accident), but you have some different risks like getting locked
out. But, overall the car looks pretty good in the case of impacts compared to the other options
(particularly when accounting for other measures of effectiveness such as speed and payload).
THREAT ASSESSMENT: Now that you have identified some potential impacts if those threats
come to pass, you must figure out the likelihood of those impacts occurring. It turns out you
have a really sneaky Red Team, and they think they could use cyber attacks to cause you to get
into a traffic accident, cause a flat tire, aid in theft, cause you to get lost easier, lock you out of
your car, or cause your engine to break down. Just taking the case of the car, they identify these
potential attack vectors, however improbable. 62

Traffic accident or car break down: Modern cars use computer chips in many
components, including the brake system and engine throttle. An adversary could
conceivably “hack” your car, gain control of the throttle and brakes, and cause you to get
into an accident. To cause the car to break down, a cyber attack can be used to disable
the engine, such as kill the throttle, flood the engine, etc.
Cause a flat tire: Some cars today have tire pressure monitoring systems that people
depend on to tell them when tire pressure is getting low, and this is typically tied into the
dashboard electronics, perhaps with a Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connection to actual pressure
gauges on the tires. Over time, or in combination with a person physically increasing or
decreasing the tire pressure, you may not get indications of over or under pressure until it
is too late, resulting in a flat tire or a blowout.
Theft: Most new cars today use remote keyless entry, and some have touch keypads in
case you lock your keys in the car. Criminals can intercept the signal from your key fob
and may be able to replay it when you’re not there to gain access to your car. In addition,
through cyber social engineering attacks, there are ways to get duplicate keys or a digital
signature associated with a certain key to enable “hot wiring” even cars with special chips
in the key required for ignition.
Lock you out of your car: Same trick for theft, but as an added step, once they gain
access to your car it is conceivable they could change the key access code. If you still
have an actual key and the car still has mechanical locks, changing the code would not
prevent you from entering, but there are some cars that no longer have physical keys –
they depend entirely on the wireless key fob to gain entry.
Cause you to get lost: You may be dependent on an in-dash GPS for navigating around
town, which sometimes have a data port (such as a USB port) that allows you to upload
new maps, software uploads, etc. Some cars may have Bluetooth or Wi-Fi capability that
allows the car to access the internet to download new maps and update software – this is
another potential attack vector. If an adversary can gain access to your dashboard
electronics, they may be able to insert a virus into your GPS system to either stop it from
working entirely, or worse, direct you to the wrong location or the wrong way down a
one-way street.

ASSESS LIKELIHOOD OF OCCURRENCE: Note that identification of potential threats does
NOT depend entirely on formal intelligence information. The Red Team came up with these
based on their knowledge of the trade space of potential car concepts – depending on the specific
type of car chosen, the threats may be more or less likely to occur. Intelligence information can
help you determine the likelihood a threat is present (i.e., what is the capability, intent, and
targeting of a given threat source, especially an adversarial threat source). For example, you may
get intelligence information that there have been a lot of car thefts recently in the mall parking
lot using key fob scanners bought off the internet, but those thieves appear to be unsophisticated
and unlikely to be able to affect your engine control system. On the other hand, you might have
intelligence information that a disgruntled computer programmer coworker that you just beat out

181

for a promotion is in the neighborhood – so there may be an elevated likelihood of someone
tampering with your engine near your home.
Taking the potential attack vectors, impacts, and likelihood of attack into account, you can
develop an initial matrix for cyber risks to your “mission”, and formulate it into a risk cube. At
this point, you still have not chosen a specific design, but you have a notional idea of the greatest
cyber risks to your chosen concept. Only after you chosen a specific design, and identified
specific vulnerabilities associated with your design, can you get a realistic full cyber risk
assessment. As a result, we will refine this risk assessment in the technology maturation and risk
reduction phase and engineering and manufacturing development phases.
SELECT INITIAL SECURITY CONTROLS: Assume that for now, despite the known cyber
threat assessment for the car, when weighted against resistance to cyber threats as a whole and
all of the other measures of effectiveness (MOEs), you choose the car as your best option to
develop. You might also have ideas of cybersecurity controls [preventive measures or
countermeasures] you can add to a car. Because they can be costly, you try to select those that
are most likely to help make your trip to the mall (your mission) more resistant to cyber attack,
or able to restore operability during an attack. So we will move onto the technology maturation
and risk reduction phase. You develop a test strategy that says you will want to do a Blue Team
assessment on your concept(s) in the technology maturation & risk assessment phase, and some
further Blue Team (simply put, Blue Team defends the network for a limited duration) testing of
your refined design during developmental test and evaluation (DT&E). Lastly, you recognize
that a cyber attack should be part of a full Red Team assessment, not in OT&E where you want
to measure performance against most of the MOEs/measures of performance (MOPs). You plan
to test your resistance to countermeasures (both physical and cyber) in a contested cyber threat
environment during a Red Team assessment.
M.2.3 Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction Phase
IMPLEMENT SECURITY CONTROLS IN PROTOTYPE PHASE: Now that you know the
threats in the technology maturation & risk reduction phase, you want to see what you can do to
minimize the risk. Thus, part of your technology development strategy is to prototype two
different car design concepts in an attempt to further quantify and buy down the risk. The first
design concept you choose to protect against the cyber threat is to go old school – you are going
to build a car that has no GPS, has mechanical door locks, uses rack and pinion steering,
hydraulic brakes with no anti-lock, and a carburetor-based engine design. Such an austere design
essentially takes you offline—it is like operating without the performance benefits of being netcentric—but it protects you from these cyber threats. For the second design concept, you choose
a modern car design with fuel injection, anti-lock brakes, 4-wheel steering, in-dash GPS, digital
entertainment console, in-dash maintenance console, electronic locks and windows, but with the
top of the line security features (key with digital chip, electronic ignition disable etc. Before you
get too enamored by all the high-tech toys, be sure the technology is really needed and can be
secured adequately).
After you construct your two prototypes, you bring in a blue team to assess your vulnerabilities.
On the old-school design, they find that you are pretty resistant to the cyber threat – on the risk
cube, all of the probabilities drop below the bottom row of the cube as there are no cyber
dependencies. No cyber controls are required as you have no cyber vulnerabilities. However,
182

when you assess against some of your other requirements and non-cyber countermeasures, you
realize it is far easier to steal or disable the car by mechanical means – a hanger through the
window to unlock the car, hot wire the car, or pulling the distributor plug from under the hood to
disable the car. In contrast, your Blue Team assesses that while there are some potential cyber
vulnerabilities to the modern car, the modern security features disable all of the mechanical
means of countering your mission, and even the cyber means are not trivial to do so.
Furthermore, they are able to identify a few controls that you may be able to implement to
further reduce the likelihood of cyber attacks being successful. The first control is to simply
disable the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity on the in-dash GPS and entertainment console.
The second control is to look around your car before you unlock it to see if there might be
anyone nearby looking suspicious with some piece of electronic equipment you do not recognize
and, if so, use the key instead of the keyless entry. The third control you identify is simply to
keep the car locked at all times – with Wi-Fi disabled, access to the in-dash electronics and the
engines under the hood are far more limited. However, an adversary could still break a window
or open the latch on the hood to gain access to cause or initiate cyber damage. Implementation
of these simple controls greatly mitigates your cyber risk, but the controls do not mitigate the
risk entirely.
Bottom line, despite the identified vulnerabilities, you feel the pros of the modern car outweigh
the cons with respect to the carburetor-based car, and you down-select to that prototype based on
the outcome of the prototype demonstration and Blue Team assessment.
REFINE SECURITY CONTROLS: As a result of the assessment, you modify your
requirements for the car and proceed to the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) stage in an
attempt to mitigate the threat. Specifically, by the PDR, you decide the threat to the engine has
the greatest potential consequence, so you decide there needs to be an anti-tamper system added
to the engine, but it will not be fully designed until the Engineering and Manufacturing
Development (EMD) phase. You complete the Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP), where
you lay out specifics on the types of tests you want to perform for both the Blue and Red Team
testing, now that you know you want to operate a modern car design. The TEMP in this case
will cover specific attempts to mess with the car engine, mess with the in-dash electronics, and
gain access to your car, but it will not test for means to give you a flat tire or lock you out of your
car, as your Blue Team assessment during this test phase assessed the likelihood of both of those
attack vectors as extremely low. You then draft the Acquisition Strategy and request for
proposal (RFP), and take it to your Chief Executive Officer (CEO) for approval to develop the
car, and assuming approval, release the RFP. Once you get your bids back, you award the EMD
contract at Milestone B (MS B).
M.2.4 Engineering and Manufacturing Development Phase
IMPLEMENT SECURITY CONTROLS: During the EMD phase, your team assesses that some
minor additional mitigations to the in-dash electronics are required, while we still need to fully
design the anti-tamper system for the engine block. For the in-dash electronics, with the Wi-Fi
and Bluetooth disabled (controls identified during TMRR phase), the only remaining entry point
into in-dash electronics is the USB port. You cannot disable the USB port, because you do need
some mechanism for upgrading the maps and GPS software, as well as allowing maintenance
technicians to access some information from the dash. Saying that, you can make it far more
183

difficult to hack if you add specific user accounts and password protect those accounts, or even
add a biometric identification system (fingerprint reader) as an added protection. In this case, a
thief or saboteur could still theoretically gain access to the systems, if they somehow manage to
get all the proper credentials; but, you’ve made it harder by adding two layers of authentication,
as well as requiring direct physical access.
This is for someone who understands the engine block design.
On the engine block design front, your engineering team delves into the design. At the
simplest level, the way it works is that individual chips scan the bus for a message that
matches their identification (ID), and then grab and process the data packet. An analogy
is your teacher has a stack of graded exams on the desk, so you walk up, scan each exam
for your name, and when you find the one with your name on it, you pick it up and take a
look at it (and ostensibly take some action based on what you see). Looking at it from
another perspective, at PDR they had designed the electronic engine controls to use
standard commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) chips that operate on the Control Area
Network (CAN) bus. A standard CAN bus message is a 94-bit packet transmission
consisting of an 11-bit identifier, some control bits, an error checking field, and up to 64
bits for data.
In an ideal world, the car engineers designed each chip to know the IDs of other chips they need
to talk to, know the range of data or commands each chip will accept, and send messages to other
chips compliant with that protocol. The problem under this approach is that all of the chips on
the CAN bus trust each other to “do the right thing,” so they do not verify the message came
from the source they think it did (authentication), and they typically do not check that the data it
sends is valid (integrity). (Lack of confidentiality is probably something you would not need to
worry about in this scenario, as we are only concerned with attackers causing adverse effects, not
that anyone can see the traffic).
This is really for someone who understands data protocols and encryption, so skip this section if
that is not your cup of tea.
So this is what your team chooses to modify. They decide to use the extended
version of the CAN protocol instead of the basic protocol, which adds an
additional 29 bit identifier after the 11 bit identifier. They encode the ID of the
source chip in the additional 29 bits. They encrypt everything except the
identifiers with the private key of the source. Then, it sends the message.
When the destination chip sees its identifier, it examines the ID of the source chip
in the next 29 bits. Doing an internal table look up to find the public key
associated with that device ID, it uses the public key of the source to decrypt the
data/command, and does a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) on the error field. If
the CRC passes, it has successfully authenticated the message. The last step is it
internally validates the data command is in a valid range, and if it is, it processes
the data and takes appropriate action.

184

There are other alternative approaches to doing this such as using a symmetric
encryption key. However, this is theoretically more secure than symmetric key,
because the symmetric key has to be shared amongst all chips for any of them to
talk to one another. If an adversary gets access to one chip and is able to
compromise it, he has the “keys to the kingdom” for that car – any bogus message
he has that chip send will be trusted by every other device.
By taking this approach, we have eliminated a whole host of controls that might be required to
mitigate an attack against the system. Specifically, we are no longer concerned about physical
access to the engine block or even the possibility of planting a bogus chip on the bus – without
both the public AND private encryption keys for the chips, they will be unable to take control of
the engine, brakes, etc., even if they have physical access to the system. In addition, other
additional control measures such as a host-based security system or bus scanner would not be
required as well.
After you successfully implement the design and are getting ready for Milestone C (MS C), you
need to do the final developmental test. You do your standard testing on the system as well as
the Blue Team testing.
But, uh-oh! Although the Blue Team verifies you’ve eliminated the vulnerability in the engine,
and dramatically reduced the risk of access to the in-dash electronics, you discover your cyber
fixes have degraded the performance of the engine to the point that the engine timing is off; the
brakes are sluggish, etc. – not an acceptable outcome.
Unfortunately, this is not an easy fix. Costly solutions are implemented when consideration for
cybersecurity is not done from the very start.
Your fishbone analysis has determined root cause that the reason this was slow is
that public key encryption generally requires much longer keys, and thus much
longer times to encrypt and decrypt, than symmetric keys for the same level of
security. In other words, the performance hit due to your cyber controls was
unacceptable from a mission performance standpoint. You could go back to the
original CAN bus design with no encryption and look at imposing additional
physical access controls and/or host-based security system and/or bus scanner. Or
you could pursue an alternative design such as going to a symmetric key system.
In a symmetric key approach, every chip on the bus would be loaded with the
same encryption key. Each chip would encrypt the CAN message with the
symmetric key, and the destination chip would decrypt it with the same key.
Authentication is achieved in the same way as Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) –
if we pass the CRC check, we are authenticated. This has the added advantage of
less read-only memory overhead to store all of the public keys – only the
symmetric key needs to be stored, and no table lookup is required to find the key
in the decryption process.
Your engineering team assesses that the symmetric algorithms should be fast enough to eliminate
the latency that plagued the PKI-based approach, and should be cheaper to retrofit than
185

implementing the other controls as only the encryption algorithms have to be changed, not the
authentication and data validation steps. Also, the other controls are expected to cause
overhead/latency within the engine and may be no better than the PKI approach. So, you
implement it and repeat DT&E.
This time, the system performance is at an acceptable level, and the Blue Team verifies this does
stop most cyber attacks. For completeness, though, you give them access to the hood of the car
and let them remove one of the chips. They take it back to their lab and recover the symmetric
key, create a new bogus chip with the symmetric key in it, and reinsert it back into the car. Once
they do this, they demonstrate that they can take control of the car.
But that’s OK. In your risk assessment, you show the probability of actually being able to do
what the Blue Team did as requiring a sequence of miracles – gaining access to a locked car,
getting the chip back to the lab, finding the encryption key, creating a duplicate bogus chip with
the symmetric key embedded, and reinstalling the chip back in your car, all within a time
duration that you would not notice someone had broken into your car and modified the car
(assuming the car would not work without the removed chip). This is well in the “green” risk
category according to your assessment, and you are willing to accept the remaining risk.
Therefore, your Program Executive Officer (PEO) certified you are ready for operational test and
evaluation (OT&E), and you proceed to MS C for Milestone Decision Authority (MDA)
approval to proceed into OT&E.
M.2.5 Production and Deployment
You go through your test with the typical operators to verify operational performance. You get
through OT with a few deficiencies, such as the car did not accelerate fast enough, you almost hit
a pedestrian at the intersection, and the GPS maps were not updated, but overall it went pretty
well.
Now they bring in an aggressive Red Team. You discover your operators forgot to lock the door
one day at the mall, and the Red Team gained access to the car. On that day, they tried to upload
a virus into your car’s GPS unit using the USB connector, but they were thwarted when they got
to the password protection. They could have eventually broken the password, but not before you
returned from the mall. Then the next day, they went old school and broke the passenger
window with a crow bar. They popped the hood, brought out their laptop with a CAN diagnostic
table attached to their serial port, and tried to send some bogus commands to the CAN bus.
However, as the chips in the system only recognize encrypted data and commands, that did not
work. Then, they swapped out your oxygen sensor chip with an off-the-shelf variant that was
loaded with malicious code to send commands to peg the accelerator to the floor, and left before
you returned. When you returned, you noted the smashed window with dismay, but you started
up the car and drove home without too much of an incident, although you noticed your
acceleration seemed a bit off.
Noticing this, you take the car to the maintainer to check it out. When the maintainer (who also
has the symmetric key to enable diagnostics) tries to figure out what’s wrong, he notices that he
cannot talk to the oxygen sensor at all. When he pulls it out to take a look at it, he discovers that
it is a bogus chip. Red Team is busted! He replaces the chip with one with the proper
encryption key.
186

But the Red Team is not done yet. The window is not fixed yet, so they replace a different chip.
Realizing they could not take control of the car, they go for a denial of service approach. Their
new bogus chip simply sends a stream of garbage commands over the bus, flooding the bus so
none of the chips are able to talk to each other. Neither the Intelligence Community nor your
early Red Team members anticipated this threat early in the program, so you never developed a
control to protect against it. Too bad! Say the operational testers, “We got you!” They declare
your system not operationally effective, because it could not be operated within that threat
environment, and they write that up in your report.
Does that mean you have to go to the start again and redesign your system to account for the
evolved threat? Not necessarily. Your team goes through what the Red Team did and assesses
how likely that scenario actually is in the real world, and what the impact is. As you perform
your analysis, you quantify the series of miracles that has to occur for the adversary to be able to
perform the attack the Red Team eventually got away with, and you show that while the attack is
possible, it is extremely low likelihood. Furthermore, you also assess that the impact of the
denial of service attack (i.e., the car does not work or reactions are very slow) is far less serious
than if they were actually able to take control of the accelerator and actually disable the brakes
while flooring the accelerator, etc.
Now you bring in the operational user and make your case to them. They agree the risk of that
particular mode of attack is at the acceptable level (i.e., it is within their risk tolerance), although
they levy a high risk deficiency report (DR) on the program to add additional controls during
sustainment or, if not possible, at the next block upgrade. Furthermore, they say that even if
there is a remote possibility the car will not work properly in that situation, the rest of the time
they do not have to walk 10 miles to the mall, in the snow, uphill both ways, because they have
this great car to take them there now.
You bring the user with you to the full rate production decision meeting with your MDA.
DOT&E brings up the weakness they observed, and the user states that they agree that the
vulnerability exists, but they can live with it, and they love the living daylights out of the car,
even with this pathological failure case. You also chime in and point out that you are still
carrying this vulnerability as a DR that you will fix as funds become available. The MDA hears
all the arguments, thanks all parties for their inputs, and gives the go ahead to start full rate
production and deployment, with a note in the acquisition decision memorandum to fix the
vulnerability as funds become available.
Congratulations! You have successfully implemented robust cyber protection in your system
from concept development through deployment of the car with a minimal amount of externally
imposed controls (and associated costs), and it is inherently more secure than even if all of the
other controls were implemented without your cyber-resistant design, through the use of a riskbased approach to cyber protection.
