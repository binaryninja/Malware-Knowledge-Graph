Who can I contact regarding being a possible victim of these cyber threats via car
internet hands free calling via iPhone, Apple pay, OnStar antenna technology and
unencryption of bank along with law firm and government agency involvement, i.e.
CMS and IRS. My family and I have been left, disabled, homeless, victimized by
property management companies, unable to obtain legal representation and evicted by
a known corrupt mortgage company/bank. We have had pages of Apple itune charges,
atm withdraws which mimic our past behavior, but of which we did not make. We had a
large sum of money disappear from our bank account were told my husband did it
through the drive they and must have a double life I do not know about. I have fried,
since 2011, two iMac hard drives which at time of purchase was assured in my life time
I could not fill up their available space or crash the hard drive, let alone two in three
years.

I'd worry about the Networks connected to the FBI, this is the very reason the FBI is not
capable of handling cryptographic keys. The private sector draws the most talent.
Obviously that talent wasn't there. Its bad enough they let something in, but not to
detect it via log or IPS , that's a problem.

The skills are in the private sector., this is why the FBI can't manage keys. I'd be
concerned about the networks they attach to. I'm sure other agencies lose trust in
them. Simple logging and IPS should have caught this within a day. it's poor
management .

How is this not front page news???? This breach far surpasses anything brought to
light by our hero whistle-blowers many whose lives have suffered terribly for exposing
the truth to the people of this country. The people need only realize their majority power
to change this way of life and rise up! #freeanons #deletetheelite
