New Perl Botnet
(Tuyul) Found with
Possible Indonesian
Attribution
ARTICLE • 14 min. read
By Eli Kreminchuker, Remi Cohen

Vitals
On January 15, 2020, F5 threat researchers detected a new campaign targeting
vulnerable PHPUnit systems (CVE-2017-9841) that tries to install an Internet Relay
Chat (IRC) bot. The bot, called Tuyul, created a botnet smaller than many we’ve
tracked in the past. At the last check in mid-February, it was composed of around
350 target systems. This is notably smaller than other botnets, which can range
from around 1,400 infected systems to upwards of 40,000 active systems in use
per day.1

Key Findings
Tuyul appears to be new. The peak size we observed had 366 victim systems
in the IRC channel.
Bots are written in a variety of programming languages, depending on their
function.2 Tuyul is written in Perl. This is not typical of what we usually see—
oftentimes IRC bots are written in PHP or Python.3
There is probable Indonesian attribution for this botnet. We came to this
assessment based on several clues, including the time zone, the botnet
name, the admin nicknames used, and the repository server, among others.
For details, see the Possible Attribution section of this article.
We continue to see this bot being actively worked on and we expect it to
continue to grow. F5 researchers will remain engaged with this botnet and
will report on any future ﬁndings.

Technical Details
First, we discuss some details of the malware itself and then the composition of
the attacker’s network.

The Malware
The threat actor uses an uncommon vulnerability for taking over the victim’s
server. The malware speciﬁcally searches for unpatched instances of PHPUnit, a
unit testing framework for the PHP programming language. It speciﬁcally exploits
CVE-2017-9841, which enables the attacker to inject arbitrary PHP code on the
server.

Figure 1. A sample request of the campaign trying to execute a bash script on
the server
By witnessing the bots respond to a pwd (print working directory) shell command
sent by the bot master, we were able to conﬁrm this was the only vulnerability
that was targeted.

Figure 2. Infected servers responding to a “pwd” shell command

Composition of the Attacker’s
Network
We were able to conﬁrm two of the registered domains the threat actor was
using with Tuyul:
https://localroot[.]zyx—Malware repository and command-and-control (C&C)
31.220.52.186—C&C development server
http://zer0art[.]com—Infection logging API
http://103.3.189.32—API development server
The localroot[.]xyz server hosts the malware ﬁles and acts as C&C under the
subdomain irc[.]localroot[.]xyz. In addition to the C&C server, the attacker
maintains two development servers for developing and testing its scripts. One
server is a development IRC server, and another server is used for logging
successful infections. The C&C server has a valid SSL certiﬁcate. In addition, both
servers take advantage of Cloudﬂare protection.

Figure 3. The C&C serve has a valid SSL certiﬁcate, and it takes advantage of
Cloudﬂare protection

Attack Methods
The attacker uses two different methods to infect and control the Tuyul-infected
victims: injecting a web shell or connecting the server to an IRC server and
joining a botnet. The following sections describe both.

Method #1: Gaining Access by Injecting a Web
Shell
The attacker uses a number of different PHP web shells to gain access to the
server. When the campaign launches, an open source application called Tiny File
Manager is used as a back door, giving the attacker easy access to the server’s
ﬁle system.

Figure 4. Tiny File Manager serves as a back door.
In later stages of the campaign, a different, unknown web shell is deployed. This
shell has more advanced capabilities and sophistication. We need to conduct
additional research to fully understand its functionality.

Notably, the shell referenced in Figure 5 uses the Black Hat logo from Black Hat
information security events.
The third web shell used was an obfuscated PHP shell that takes three steps
when deployed. In the ﬁrst step, a bash dropper called inject executes on the
target server. The script does two things: ﬁrst, it downloads a PHP script from the
main localroot[.]xyz server.

Figure 6. Inject bash dropper
If this ﬁrst script is successfully executed on the server, a POST request is sent to
an API on the second zero0art[.]com server, logging the successful infection.

Figure 7. A POST request logging the successful infection in a dedicated API
After a successful execution, the PHP script server acts as a dropper by installing
an obfuscated PHP back door in several locations on the server.

Figure 8. The PHP dropper inject.php
The back door is installed and receives commands through a parameter called
preman, which appears to be the one of the attacker’s monikers.

Figure 9. PHP back door that receives commands
We were able to obtain the source code of the API script and found an important
clue about the attacker’s origin. The PHP code had a date_default_timezone_set
function set to Asia/Jakarta.

Figure 10. The attacker’s API source code with Asia/Jakarta set as the default
time

Method #2: Gaining Access via an IRC Botnet
The second infection method connects the victim’s server to an IRC botnet. The
malware is written in Perl, and this makes it worth thinking about. In the past, Perl
was a popular language for writing attack tools. Since Perl is easier than lowerlevel languages such as C, it attracted many script kiddies.4 The DDoS Perl
IRCBot script written in 2012 is still one of the most common IRC malware scripts
in use today. But since 2005,5 Perl has been on the decline in favor of Python for
IRC bots and general programming. As noted in the Key Findings, many IRC
botnets are now created with Python. Perl is still used due to its low entry barrier
and is a common language for script kiddies to learn. Because it can be used to
create powerful and dense programs, there are still many Perl users around the
globe.6 Developing a malicious script in 2020 in Perl makes this threat actor’s
choice interesting.
The ﬁrst stage of the infection instructs the server to download a Bash script
dropper (see Figure 11). The dropper instructs the server to download a compiled
Perl binary and execute it on the system. If it is unsuccessful, it then tries to
download an uncompiled version of the ﬁle and execute it using Perl.

Figure 11. The join bash dropper that tells a server to execute a Perl script
At the time of writing, the binary version of this malware went undetected by
antivirus software. This allows the attacker to work on the machine virtually
undetected by a signature-based antivirus.

Figure 12. The binary version of the malware goes undetected by antivirus
engines
If successfully executed, the server connects to an IRC server on the attacker’s
C&C server (irc[.]localroot[.]xyz), where it joins the rest of the infected servers
waiting for further instructions from the attacker (see Figure 13).

Figure 13. The IRC bot malware conﬁguration
To stay persistent on the system, the malware periodically downloads a bash
script named cron, which ensures that the Tuyul script is still installed (see Figure
14).

It also detects and kills rival processes of other malware infections (see Figure
15).

Malware Source Code
While monitoring the campaign, we collected four different versions of the
malware source code. Despite these different versions, the following core
functionalities remained the same:

pro: Promotes a bot to a higher privilege. Allowing the bot to execute
commands on other bots.
noob: Demotes the bot from “pro” status.
update: Downloads and installs a newer version of the malware.
bc: Connects to a reverse shell.
shell: Executes a shell command.
perl: Executes a Perl script.
terminate, suicide: Kills the bot’s connection.
From the list of commands in the script, it is diﬃcult to determine the intentions of
the bot master. Unlike previous well-known IRC bots, where commands had more
speciﬁc descriptions such as DDoS or crypto mining capabilities, Tuyul bot has
only general-purpose commands. While monitoring the botnet, we did not notice
any activity involving these bots besides maintenance. Some individual bots
were spotted spreading the Tuyul malware, but we did not detect a mass
activation of the botnet.

Composition of the Tuyul Botnet
The infected server connects to the attacker’s IRC server and joins the
conﬁgured channel. In the ﬁrst versions of the malware the channel used was
called “#idiot,” revealing the actor’s feelings toward the victims.
Each bot connecting to the server is given a nickname with a “TuYuL” preﬁx and a
random string.

Figure 16. Tuyul botnet showing 179 bots connected
For obvious reasons, the script permits only certain nicknames to operate the
bot. In early versions, four different nicknames were deﬁned as admins. This
indicates that the campaign might be a joint effort and not the work of a single
individual. In later versions of the code, the number of admins was reduced to
two.

Figure 17. Early version conﬁguration of Tuyul botnet
Since we had the source code and could see which admins that bot listens to, we
wanted to see if it was possible to take over the botnet. First, we tried to activate
a bot in a private chat with a non-admin nickname:

Figure 18. Users attempting to execute a shell command using a non-admin
nickname
But when changing the nickname to one of the admins who was unsigned to the
server, we could execute commands on the infected bots, as shown in Figure 19.

Figure 19. Users attempting to execute a shell command using an admin
nickname
After a few days of monitoring the channel, the bot master noticed our activity
and registered the nicknames of the admins and white-listed the IRC clients
allowed to join the network. This prevented us from pretending to be admins and
controlling the bots.
During our research, the botnet peaked at around 350 bots, which is a relatively
small size botnet. For example, last year a different IRC botnet was reported with
more than 1,400 bots.7 Most of the victims are hosted on cloud services such as
Amazon Web Services (AWS) and DigitalOcean, and about a third are hosted on
Linode. When we conducted a geolocation of the IP addresses on the botnet, we
found that U.S. and U.K. servers accounted for almost half of the bots.

Probable Attribution
Please note that at the time of publication, no group had yet claimed this botnet
and we do not have oﬃcial attribution of the individuals writing and operating
Tuyul. Our probable Indonesian attribution is based on many pieces of evidence
gathered while investigating this malware.
Time zone. The Asia/Jakarta time zone, as discussed in the Attack Methods
section, is an important clue because it sets the default time zone used by all
date/time functions.8 This is the most convincing evidence of the attacker’s origin
that was set inside the API source code, as explained in the Malware section.
While this may be purposefully set to a different time zone, it is only one of many
indicators we look at when determining possible attribution. In addition, several
other clues also pointed to Indonesia.
Administrator nicknames. The admin nicknames when used to conﬁgure this
botnet may provide possible attribution information. Preman, one of the
monikers used, is a word for an Indonesian gangster and, according to
Wikipedia, is a member of an organized crime group.9
When connecting to the C&C development environment, the Indonesian phrase
"assalamualaikum pak aji" appears. It does not appear on the main C&C.
IP address. As investigations into this bot continued, the new version had an
interesting IP address that exposed the threat actor’s development environment.
The threat actor runs this development environment to test new versions of the
Perl script. After the admins’ nicknames were registered we continued to monitor
activity from both the main and development IRC servers. In the development
IRC server, admin nicknames were not registered and there was an additional

clue to the threat actor’s origin, including the use of the phrase assalamualaikum
pak aji, which translates to “greetings sir Aji.” According to names.org, the name
Aji may have many origins—one of the common ones is from Indonesia and
means “bless.”10

Figure 20. Development server showing the phrase assalamualaikum pak aji
Malware repository. In later stages of the research, a message on the main
malware repository was added when trying to access non-existent ﬁles—hidup
ini indah, an Indonesian phrase that translates to “life is beautiful.”

Figure 21. The phrase “hidup ini indah” in Indonesian (“life is beautiful” in
English)
Botnet name. The name of this botnet is also a possible indicator of origin and
attribution. A Tuyul, also sometimes spelled Toyol, is a ﬁgure in Southeast Asia, in
particular in Indonesian folklore.11 The Tuyul appears in this folklore as an undead
infant who is invoked using black magic to conduct tasks such as theft, sabotage,
or other crimes. According to IMDB, a 2015 horror movie called Tuyul was a
modern reimagining of this Indonesian mythology in which the Tuyul hurts a
family living in its house.12
Based on these ﬁndings, we concluded that the threat actor running the Tuyul
botnet was probably in Indonesia. At this time, we do not attribute this activity to
a state-sponsored actor. We cannot say with certainty if this is tied to organized
crime or cybercriminal activity, however, cybercriminal activity has often been
located in Indonesia. In January 2020, Indonesia conducted the ﬁrst arrests of
three men on suspicion of being part of the Magecart attacks.13 Along with that, a
number of nonstate groups in Indonesia have perpetuated malicious activity,
either under a speciﬁc campaign or for personal gain.4, 5, 6
We are continuing to see this bot being actively worked on, and we expect it to
grow. F5 researchers will remain engaged with this botnet and will report on any
future ﬁndings.

Conclusion
This new campaign shows that botnets continue to be a threat to organizations
and have a variety of uses, ranging from IRC bots to shopping bots to crypto
mining. Those interested in building botnets don’t need to go far to ﬁnd source
code to create their own. Botnets for service are also common and easy to buy.
