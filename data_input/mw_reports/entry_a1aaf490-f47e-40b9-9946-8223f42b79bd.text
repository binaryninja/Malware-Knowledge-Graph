Here is a more detailed description of this chain:
Initial Access
The Cring ransomware gains initial access either through unsecure or compromised RDP or
valid accounts.
The ransomware can also get into the system through certain vulnerability exploits.. The
abuse of the aforementioned Adobe ColdFusion flaw (CVE-2010-2861) to enter the system
is a new development for the threat. In the past, Cring was also used to exploit a FortiGate
VPN server vulnerability (CVE-2018-13379).
Credential Access

1/3

Threat actors behind Cring used weaponized tools in their attacks. One of these tools is
Mimikatz, which was used to steal account credentials of users who had previously logged
into the system.
Lateral Movement and Defense Evasion
Lateral movement was done through Cobalt Strike. This tool was also used to distribute BAT
files that will be used later for various purposes, including impairing the system’s defenses.
Command and Control and Execution
Cobalt Strike was also used to continuously communicate with the main command-andcontrol (C&C) server.
BAT files were used to download and execute the Cring ransomware on the other systems in
the compromised network. It also uses the Windows CertUtil program to help with the said
download.
Impact
Once Cringhas been executed in the system, it disables services and processes that might
hinder the ransomware’s encryption routine. The threat will also delete backup files and
folders. This will make restoring the encrypted files difficult for the victim, thereby placing
more pressure on them to pay the ransom.
The ransomware will then proceed with its encryption routine and delete itself using a BAT
file.

Regions and industries with the Cring ransomware detections
Based on our data, most of the Cring ransomware detections for attempted attacks were
observed in Europe and the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region. There have also been
incidents in the Latin American Region (LAR), Asia Pacific (APAC), and North America
(NABU).
The affected countries in the said regions were Azerbaijan, Brazil, Italy, Mexico, Saudi
Arabia, the United States, and Turkey. With regard to industries, detections affected the
finance and transportation sectors. Indeed, ransomware has been consistently attacking
critical industries, as we discuss in our midyear report.

How to protect systems from ransomware
With ransomware, prevention is one of the most potent forms of protection. A proactive
approach such as patching vulnerabilities and monitoring systems for signs of unusual
behavior helps curb ransomware before it can cause any real damage to a system.

In the larger scheme of things, coming up with ransomware defense plans will help
enterprises know which steps to prioritize. Here are some best practices that follow the lead
of frameworks set by the Center of Internet Security (CIS)and the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST):
Audit events and take inventory. Audit both event and incident logs to spot
suspicious behavior.Take note of all assets and data. Identify authorized and
unauthorized devices and programs.
Configure and monitor. Manage hardware and software configurations. Only grant
administrative privileges when necessary.
Patch and update. Conduct regular vulnerability assessments and patching or virtual
patching for operating systems and programs. Update software and applications.
Protect systems and recover data. Administer data protection, backup, and recovery
measures. Implement multifactor authentication (MFA).
Secure and defend layers: Perform sandbox analysis to filter malicious
emails. Employ security solutions to all layers of the system such as email, endpoint,
web, and network.
Train and test. Conduct regular training and security skills assessment for employees.
Perform red-team exercises and penetration tests.

Trend Micro solutions
Organizations can benefit from multilayered protection (for layers such as endpoint, email,
web, and network) with security solutions that can detect malicious components and help
monitor concealed malicious behaviors in the system.
Trend Micro Vision One™ spots suspicious behaviors that might seem insignificant when
observed from only a single layer. Trend Micro Apex One™ protects endpoint devices
through automated threat detection and response against ransomware, fileless threats, and
other advanced concerns.
Trend Micro Cloud One™ Workload Security defends systems against threats that exploit
vulnerabilities. This is done through virtual patching, machine learning (ML), and harnessing
the latest in global threat intelligence.
Trend Micro™ Deep Discovery™ Email Inspector employs custom sandboxing and
advanced analysis techniques to effectively block ransomware before it gets into the system,
since one of the ways ransomware spreads is through malicious emails.
