How the "Contact Forms" campaign tricks people
Introduction
This diary is based on an infection I started on Monday 2021-12-13 at 21:45 UTC that ran until Tuesday 202112-14 at 17:17 UTC. The infection generated traffic for IcedID (Bokbot), DarkVNC, and Cobalt Strike. A pcap
of the network traffic and the associated malware samples are available here.
"Contact Forms" is a campaign that uses a web site's contact form to email malicious links disguised as some
sort of legal complaint. We've seen this campaign push BazarLoader malware and distribute Sliver, but
recently it's been pushing IcedID (Bokbot). Most of the time, the Contact Forms campaign uses a "Stolen
Images Evidence" theme, with emails stating a supposed violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
(DMCA). Below is an example seen on December 9th, 2021.

Shown above: Contact form email spoofing someone from slack.com.
A website's contact form is easy method for cyber criminals to reach an organization. They can enter any
name, email, and message text in these forms to deliver. With anonymous browsing methods like tor or VPN,
criminals can hide their true location when filling out these forms.
In this case, the link is a googleapis URL that abuses Google services to distribute malware. I checked the
link in a web browser, and it was a "Stolen Images Evidence" themed web page. The page automatically
presented an ISO file named Stolen_Images_Evidence.iso.

2/8

Shown above: "Stolen Images Evidence" page sending an ISO file.
ISO files have been used by cyber criminals for years, and the Contact Forms campaign started consistently
delivering ISO files from these pages as early as November 30th, 2021. Prior to that, this campaign almost
always sent zip archives.

Shown above: Stolen_Images_Evidence.iso downloaded on 2021-12-13.
Double-clicking an ISO file on a Windows host will mount the file as a drive, then it will open Windows
Explorer to view its contents. In this example, the double-clicked ISO file appears at F: as a DVD drive, and it
contains a Windows shortcut.

3/8

Shown above: Windows Explorer shows the ISO file mounted as a DVD drive at F:\.
By default, Windows Explorer does not show hidden files, so we should reveal hidden files from the Explorer
menu.

Shown above: Revealing hidden items in Windows Explorer.

4/8

Revealing hidden files, we find a DLL and a JavaScript (.js) file hiding in the ISO. The Windows shortcut runs
both files. It runs the DLL using regsvr32.exe, and it also runs the .js file separately.

Shown above: Hidden DLL and JS file, and the Windows shortcut designed to run them both.
Examining the Windows shortcut in a hex editor, we find a Windows user account named lamar that may have
been used when creating the shortcut.

5/8

Shown above: Windows user account name lamar seen in the Windows shortcut.
The account name lamar has been consistent in each shortcut I've examined from these ISO files since they
started appearing from the Contact Forms campaign on 2021-11-30.

Final words
This and similar IcedID infections have led to Cobalt Strike, which can lead to other malicious activity like
ransomware as reported in this real-world example.
