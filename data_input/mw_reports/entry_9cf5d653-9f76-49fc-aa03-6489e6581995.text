Introducing Loda Malware

2/14

May 10, 2017 Proofpoint Staff
Loda is a previously undocumented AutoIT malware with a variety of capabilities for spying on victims.
Proofpoint first observed Loda in September of 2016 and it has since grown in popularity. The name
‘Loda’ is derived from a directory to which the malware author chose to write keylogger logs (Figure 14). It
should be noted that some antivirus products currently detect Loda as “Trojan.Nymeria”, although the
connection is not well-documented.
Loda appears to be distributed by multiple cybercrime actors targeting a variety of verticals. We have
observed Loda spread via email campaigns containing Microsoft Word attachments with macros (Figure
3), exploits, or packager shell objects (Figure 4). Notably, we found a document that used the recent CVE2017-0199 exploit (Figure 1). In addition, we have observed Loda distributed via PDF attachments, links,
and executable attachments (Figure 2).
While Loda is a threat on its own, we have also seen campaigns where it was used to download additional
information-stealing malware, such as the ISR Stealer.

Analysis
We have observed two versions of the malware, 1.0.0 and 1.0.1, in the wild. Both were tagged as beta
versions of the software. In both versions, the malware copies itself to a directory in the %TEMP% folder
and creates persistence using a scheduled task. This is typically a 6-character task name which
references the executable that was copied to %TEMP%. The malware checks in to a command and
control (C&C) server and reports the following information:
Victim’s Country
A hard coded string (seen ‘victim’, ‘Clientv4’)
Victim’s IP address
User account name

7/14

Windows version
Windows architecture (X64 or X86)
Webcam installed (Yes or No, enumerated using capGetDriverDescription from Avicap32.dll)
Installed AV Vendor (enumerated via running process names)
Malware version, i.e. 1.0.1
Hard coded string (seen ‘ddd’)
Monitor resolution in a special format (“Pr[Height]X2[Width]X3”)
OS type (can be “laptop”, “Desktop”, or “x”, enumerated using the WMI query "Select * from
Win32_SystemEnclosure")
Version (beta)

Since Loda is written in AutoIt, the executable is trivial to decompile. The author of the malware took slight
measures to combat this and has obfuscated the AutoIt source code using several generic techniques.
The most notable example is the use of string obfuscation on most variables. Strings are hex-encoded
and concatenated into a larger string with a separator value that appears to be unique in each sample. At
run time, variables are initialized based on parsing the large string into an array that is created based on
the separator value. Finally, each variable is initialized based on the index of the array that the string is in.

elements)
Loda accepts a wide range of commands from the C&C with the following functionality:
Send a file to C&C
Receive text from C&C and write to file (likely for batch files)

Receive data from C&C and write as binary (executable) and run it (Figure 12)
Execute a hidden Windows Media Player streaming from an arabic radio MMS (Figure 11)
Close windows media player (likely related to above)
Upload keylogger data (Figure 10)
Delete keylogger data
Read text to victim using SAPI.SpVoice (text sent from C&C)
Get file or directory sizes (path requested from C&C)
Shutdown victim PC
Change wallpaper via registry modifications
Zip/Unzip files (to exfil to C&C or to decompress from C&C)
Basic ShellExecute command
Copy file or directory (paths requested from C&C)
Enumerate attached drives
Enumerate common folder locations (Desktop/Pictures/Profile/Appdata/Temp)
Detect UAC settings
Download and play .wav files from C&C
Record microphone sounds using Windows Sound Recorder (Figure 9)
Send mouse clicks (left or right being separate commands)
Capture screenshot and send to C&C
Open/Close CD tray
Download and execute a file (HTTP path specified from C&C)
Create a GUI Chat window (Victim/Attacker conversation saved to a file; see Figure 8)
Record Webcam
Delete Chrome/Firefox cookies (closes browsers to do this)
Send running process names to C&C
Close a running process

We were able to observe the network traffic associated with these C&C communications, a sample of
which is shown in Figure 13.

Conclusion
Loda malware is a robust keylogger and remote access Trojan with extensive capabilities for collecting
and exfiltrating victim information from infected PCs. Since we first observed it in the wild last fall, its
footprint has increased dramatically with multiple threat actors distributing the malware via a range of
email vectors. It has appeared in attacks across multiple verticals and been used as both a standalone
threat and an intermediate loader. While fairly straightforward to analyze because it was coded in AutoIT,
Loda’s capabilities for data collection, system control, direct victim interaction, and flexible C&C
communications pose significant risks for victims and organizations with infected PCs.
