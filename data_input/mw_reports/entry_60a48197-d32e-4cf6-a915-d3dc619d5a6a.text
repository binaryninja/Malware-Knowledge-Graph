We at K7 Labs recently identified an interesting technique used by threat actors to execute
a Remote Admin Tool. We all know that WerFault.exe is used for the Windows Error
Reporting. This blog describes how threat actors use the legitimate WerFault.exe to
execute Pupy RAT on the victims’ machine.

Stage 1 – WerFault Execution

1/7

Recently we came across an ISO image, recent inventory & our specialties.iso from a
twitter feed. The ISOcontains four files, a legitimate WerFault.exe,a malicious DLL named
faultrep.dll, a shortcut file named recent inventory & our specialties.lnkand a XLS file
named File.xls. The shortcut file has the same name as the ISO image. When the victim
opens that shortcut file, it uses scriptrunner.exe LOLBin via cmd to execute WerFault.exe
from the ISO.

Stage 2 – Pupy RAT loader
Originally, Faultrep.dll is the name of DLL used by WerFault.exe is, which is present in the
default windows folder. When WerFault.exe starts executing, it uses DLL Side-Loading
technique to load the Faultrep.dll from the ISO and it has a dummy export function
WerpInitiateCrashReporting similar to the original DLL.This malicious Faultrep.dll is
compiled in C.
The DLL has a custom API resolving function with two arguments, DLL hash and Function
hash.

Figure 3:

API Resolving
We noticed that this loader uses the same API resolving function as Guloader. The DLLs
resolved were kernel32 and advapi32.
After resolving the APIs, it starts to serve its purpose. Using the resolved function
CreateThread, it creates two threads. The first thread opens a lure excel sheet named
file.xls from the ISO.

While manually resolving the function, we found that one of the functions it resolved was
SystemFunction032 from the advapi32.dll. This function is undocumented in MSDN and
on further searching we found the documentation on WineAPI. With that documentation,
we understood that the function is used for RC4 encryption and accepts two arguments:
keyand data. On further analysis we found the RC4 decryption function which contains the
data and hard coded string as key.

Figure 5: Second thread doing RC4 decryption
The data is pointed to the address of the overlay. So we dumped the encrypted overlay
data and using the key we further decrypted it. After decrypting the data, we confirmed that
the data is a PE file with the magic bytes.

Figure 6: RC4 Decryption
We dumped the decrypted output data to a PE file. It was compiled with C & Python and
found that it is a Pupy RAT. This RAT is loaded into the memory and executed while
WerFault.exe was executing in the front.

Stage 3 – Pupy RAT
Pupy RAT is an open-source cross platform Remote Admin Tool available in Github
According to the sources, since 2013 it has possibly been used by APT33 and APT35 from
Iran for cyber espionage operations like the one that was discovered in 2020 and targeted
a major European energy organisation.

It was executed from memory and based on the analysis of ReflectiveLoader function, is
capable of executing any PE file in-memory, remotely. It tries to make a C2 connection in
the background when the victim believes WerFault is running. Since the C2 was down at
the time of analysis, RAT was unable to establish a connection for carrying out any further
malicious activity. With the XLS sheet in Chinese, we believe that the victim is from China.

We at K7 Labs provide detection against latest threats and also for this newer variant of
Loader. Users are advised to use a reliable security product such as “K7 Total Security”
and keep it up-to-date so as to safeguard their devices.
