Introduction
Cyber attacks from the Lazarus Group, a threat actor associated with North Korea, has not
slowed down and their malware toolset continues to evolve. A few months ago, we published a
general research of the Lazarus Group and the Blockbuster campaign including code reuse
and similarities throughout their malware up until the latest news regarding targeting bitcoin
and cryptocurrency exchanges. In recent attacks, the Lazarus Group has been spreading
malicious documents with a RAT embedded inside that gets executed through a VBA macro.
These malicious documents contained a job description for different positions in various
industries.
Through our research, we came across a new malicious document where we have found
changes and a continuation to their campaign targeting potential cryptocurrency exchanges,
FinTech, financial companies, and others who might be involved with cryptocurrencies. The
malicious document came embedded with an upgraded and revamped version of a RAT they
have added to their arsenal.

Infection Vector
The malicious document’s original creation name is “Investment Proposal.doc” and attempts to
impersonate an employee of an Australia based law firm for commercial and financial services
1/18

named Holley Nethercote. The document states that they have evaluated several
cryptocurrencies and they have put together an investment proposal aimed at FinTech,
financial, and other companies who might be interested in taking an investment. As can be
seen in the photos of the document below, the document is of very low quality, meaning there
are inconsistencies and typos everywhere in a document supposedly from a law firm.

The first page contains a basic description of what the investment proposal involves. Take note
of the name “Kate Harris,” a director from Holley Nethercote, by whom the document was
2/18

supposedly written.

The second page is a general description of the company Holley Nethercote which is directly
taken from the first page of a PDF on the company’s website.

3/18

The third page is a list of their employees and staff as can also be found on their
website. Remember Kate Harris, the director, from before? Shockingly enough, she does not
exist on this list.

4/18

The fourth page contains a chart of various cryptocurrencies and random values associated
with them. The interesting point here is the date of a Bitcoin price that it mentions from
February 9th, 2018 which helps us put on a timeline of when this malicious document was
originally created.

5/18

The fifth page states how they would like to invest $50M in the company that received this
document and contains some typos like “out” instead of “our” and other grammatical errors.

6/18

The sixth page is a very poorly written document supposedly signed by the CEO of Holley
Nethercote involving the investment proposition. It also contains various typos and
grammatical errors with the general flow not making sense.

7/18

The seventh and last page contains some fake contact information including a phone number
from the UK that is from an online service that allows you to receive an SMS through the
website.

Technical Details
Upon launching the document, an obfuscated VBA macro is executed to drop and execute an
embedded remote access tool.
8/18

(embedded VBA macro)
The embedded RAT is dropped to and executed from %USERPROFILE%\RuntimeBroker.exe.
More evidence besides the date in the content of the document, pointing to this malware out in
February is that we can also see the compilation timestamp is from February 14, 2018 and the
upload date was on March 2, 2018.
After uploading the RAT to Intezer Analyze™, we found 4% of the code to have been used in
previous malware attributed to the Lazarus group, but 85% of the code base is completely
unique. This says to us that they made some changes to their code.

(https://analyze.intezer.com/#/analyses/ffb3993e-d646-42ad-8449-104d751cc17b)
The first code that gets executed within the RAT first decrypts a locally created, XOR
encrypted buffer of names of modules and imports that it resolves via GetProcAddress.
Resolving the binary’s own imports in this manner is very common in many of the previous
9/18

Lazarus attributed malware.

Next, the RAT creates a shortcut of itself to %USERPROFILE%\Start
Menu\Programs\Startup\RuntimeBroker.lnk in order to maintain persistence and sets the
attributes of itself using SetFileAttributesW to HIDDEN | SYSTEM | NORMAL. Inside of the
function that is used for setting up the persistence, we can find a call to a function that is
responsible for decrypting a buffer containing multiple wide strings used throughout the binary.

10/18

As can be seen in the function, it uses a very basic decryption routine to decrypt the locally
stored buffer. The decrypted buffer is as follows:

11/18

The parameter to the function responsible for decrypting this buffer is an offset to grab a string
from this decrypted buffer by multiplying it by two, since these are wide strings.
Strangely enough, a lot of these strings are not used anywhere in the binary. By the strings,
you can see there is an intention of including a simple anti-VM technique to detect VirtualBox.
There is also one more function located within the binary, responsible for the same
functionality with a different buffer containing different strings.

Following all of this, the RAT then creates a backdoor which then waits to receive commands
from the various C&C servers.

12/18

The C&C handler used to follow a pattern of command IDs but it appears to have changed to
random command values and contains commands with new functionality. Their handler is able
to handle 22 different commands and the descriptions of each can be found in the chart below.

Conclusion
As we can see, the Blockbuster campaign and the Lazarus group are still active and have
shown a continued interest in cryptocurrencies and companies surrounding cryptocurrency.
Numerous exchanges are believed to have been hacked by the Lazarus group and there has
been a significant amount of money stolen by doing so. Since their efforts have been so
successful, it does not look like they will slow down anytime soon with these types of targets.
