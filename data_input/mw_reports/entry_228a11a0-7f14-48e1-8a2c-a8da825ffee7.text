Important Security Update
mimecast.com/blog/important-security-update/

At Mimecast, we prioritize the security of our customers, and our commitment to being
transparent with them, above all else. These two principles have guided our rapid response
to the recent security incident, as well as this update and the customer and partner guidance
we are providing today via directed actions in the Administration Console and the Mimecast
Community.
As we previously shared, when Microsoft informed us about the compromise of a Mimecastissued certificate used to authenticate a subset of Mimecast’s products, we advised affected
customers to break and re-establish their connections with newly issued keys. The vast
majority of these customers have taken this action, and Microsoft has now disabled use of
the former connection keys for all affected Mimecast customers.
We also launched an internal investigation, supported by leading third-party forensics
experts, and we are coordinating our activities with law enforcement. Our investigation has
now confirmed that this incident is related to the SolarWinds Orion software compromise and
was perpetrated by the same sophisticated threat actor.
Our investigation also showed that the threat actor accessed, and potentially exfiltrated,
certain encrypted service account credentials created by customers hosted in the United
States and the United Kingdom. These credentials establish connections from Mimecast
tenants to on-premise and cloud services, which include LDAP, Azure Active Directory,
Exchange Web Services, POP3 journaling, and SMTP-authenticated delivery routes.

Although we are not aware that any of the encrypted credentials have been decrypted
or misused, we are advising customers hosted in the United States and United
Kingdom to take precautionary steps to reset their credentials.
We have taken actions to isolate and remediate the identified threat, which we believe to be
effective. We continue to examine and closely monitor our environment. We will continue to
communicate updates directly to our customers if warranted, and, where appropriate, these
will be disclosed here on the Mimecast Blog. While we are committed to transparency and
sharing insights with our customers, there may be limits to the details we can provide at this
time while elements of the investigation into this threat actor remain ongoing.
Recent threat intelligence reports have described the campaign of attacks waged by this
threat actor. It is clear that this incident is part of a highly sophisticated large-scale attack and
is focused on specific types of information and organizations.
Now more than ever, transparency and cooperation within the security community are
essential to an effective response. We expect that additional organizations will learn or share
that they were affected by the threat actor behind the SolarWinds Orion software
compromise. We have benefited from the expertise shared by others facing this threat, and
we are committed to doing the same, based on our own experience, to create a more secure
and resilient community.
Protecting our customers will always be our company’s top priority.
