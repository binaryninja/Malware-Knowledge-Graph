This blog is part two of a two-part series focused on how Microsoft DART helps customers
with human-operated ransomware. For more guidance on human-operated ransomware and
how to defend against these extortion-based attacks, refer to our human-operated
ransomware docs page.
In part one of this blog series, we described the process and execution used in our customer
engagements to provide perspective on the unique issues and challenges regarding humanoperated ransomware. We also explained how Microsoft’s Detection and Response Team
(DART) leverages Microsoft solutions to help combat this threat. In this post, we will tackle
the risks of human-operated ransomware and detail DART’s security recommendations for
tactical containment actions and post-incident activities in the event of an attack.

Understanding the risks of human-operated ransomware
Beyond the immediate threat of file encryption, there are several additional risks associated
with human-operated ransomware events, some of which may be observed well after an
investigation and the removal of the threat from the network. These risks include:

1. Disruption of business operations
Immediate actions need to be taken to reduce the blast radius of a ransomware event. In
these cases, disabling portions of the network may feel like a self-inflicted denial of service,
but they are necessary to counter the ransomware spread. The resulting business disruption

may become public. If any affected systems are public-facing, it may require crisis
communications.

2. Data theft
Most attackers are highly motivated to monetize their access to your network. In several
cases investigated by DART, an attacker has performed reconnaissance for sensitive files
(like contracts, financial documents, and internal communications), copied this data, and
exfiltrated it before any ransomware was dropped. Taking this information before
ransomware is deployed allows the attacker to have data to sell, leak, or simply show as
proof that the attacker has had access to sensitive files.

3. Extortion
Data theft by ransomware operators opens an organization to extortion. It is not uncommon
for threat actors to demand payment to prevent the leak of stolen data. These threats are
typically sent via email with sample stolen documents attached as proof of possession. In
some cases where DART has observed this activity, a threat actor accessed a cloud-based
email account that was not protected by multifactor authentication (MFA) and sent
threatening emails to the board of directors. The threat of extortion is still high, even when
the threat actors are unsuccessful at deploying ransomware.
At DART, we often get asked, “Can you tell us which data was stolen?” To prove this requires
concrete evidence, which would be either:
A network capture that shows the actual data leaving the network (which rarely exists).
Or
Finding the data outside the organization’s network, typically on a public file-sharing
site. A log file showing ‘x’ bytes were transferred does not prove what data was stolen,
and a command line history or event log showing a file archiving utility was run does
not prove that data was stolen.

4. Follow-on attacks
To further their monetization efforts, attackers are also often observed deploying coin miners
in compromised networks. This is a low-effort method to generate additional income from a
victim organization when data theft or extortion are insufficient for the attacker. Depending on
the attacker’s motivation, additional malware may be deployed that would allow other
criminals to gain access to the environment. This access is monetized, and the sale of
compromised network access is common in most human-operated ransomware cases,
performed after the primary attacker has obtained what they initially sought.

5. Reputational damage
2/8

The risk of brand damage reputation is difficult to assess in the aftermath of a humanoperated ransomware event. The reputation of an organization’s brand may include lost
customer and shareholder trust and loyalty, as well as current and future business. The risk
of brand damage reputation is difficult to assess in the aftermath of a human-operated
ransomware event. Reputational damage may be more costly and require longer-term
solutions than the response to the human-operated ransomware event.

6. Compliance and regulatory reporting
Potential reporting requirements are another organizational risk depending on the industry or
affiliation. This may include compliance or regulatory reporting in cases where sensitive
financial information or personally identifiable information (PII) is stolen. Fines and loss of
accreditation may further damage an organization’s reputation.

Recommendations and best practices
Containment
Containment can only happen once we determine what needs to be contained. In the case of
ransomware, the adversary’s goal is to obtain credentials that allow administrative control
over a highly available server and then deploy the ransomware. In some cases, the threat
actor identifies sensitive data and exfiltrates it to a location they control.
Tactical recovery will be unique for each customer and tailored to the customer’s
environment, industry, and level of IT expertise and experience. The steps outlined below are
recommended for short-term and tactical containment steps your organization can take. To
learn more about securing privileged access for long-term guidance, visit our securing
privileged access docs page. For a comprehensive view of ransomware and extortion and
how to protect your organization, you can refer to our human-operated ransomware docs
page.

Figure 1. Containment steps that can be done concurrently as new vectors are discovered.
After the first step of containment (assessing the scope of the situation), the second step is
to preserve existing systems:
Disable all privileged user accounts except for a few accounts used by your admins
to assist in resetting the integrity of your Active Directory infrastructure. If a user
account is believed to be compromised, disable it immediately.
Isolate compromised systems from the network, but do not shut them off.
Isolate at least one known good domain controller in every domain—two is even
better. Either disconnect them from the network or shut them down entirely. The object
here is to stop the spread of ransomware to critical systems—identity being among the
most vulnerable. If all your domain controllers are virtual, ensure that the virtualization
platform’s system and data drives are backed to offline external media (not connected
to the network) in case the virtualization platform itself is compromised.
Isolate critical known good application servers (for example SAP, configuration
management database (CMDB), billing, and accounting systems).
These two steps can be done concurrently as new vectors are discovered. Disable those
vectors and then try to find a known good system to isolate from the network.
Other tactical containment actions can be accomplished:

Reset the krbtgt password, twice in rapid succession. Consider using a scripted,
repeatable process. This script enables you to reset the krbtgt account password and
related keys while minimizing the likelihood of Kerberos authentication issues being
caused by the operation. To minimize potential issues, the krbtgt lifetime can be
reduced one or more times prior to the first password reset so that the two resets are
done relatively quickly. NOTE: All domain controllers that you plan to keep in your
environment must be online.
Deploy a Group Policy to the entire domain(s) that prevents privileged log on (Domain
Admins) to anything but Domain Controllers and privileged administrative-only
workstations (if any).
Install all missing security updates for operating systems and applications. Every
missing update is a potential threat vector that adversaries can quickly identify and
exploit. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint’s Threat and Vulnerability Management
provides an easy way to see exactly what is missing—as well as the potential impact of
the missing updates.
For Windows 10 (or higher) devices, confirm that the current version (or n-1) is
running on every device.
Apply attack surface reduction (ASR) rules to prevent malware infection.
Enable all Windows 10 security features.
Check that every external facing application, including VPN access, is protected by
multifactor authentication, preferably using an authentication application that is running
on a secured device.
For devices not using Defender for Endpoint as their primary antivirus software, run a
full scan with Microsoft Safety Scanner on isolated “known good” systems before
reconnecting them to the network.
For any legacy operating systems, upgrade to a supported OS or decommission these
devices. If these options are not available, take every possible measure to isolate these
devices, including network/VLAN isolation, IPsec rules, and log on restrictions, so they
are only accessible to the applications by the users/devices to provide business
continuity.
DART sometimes finds customers who are running mission critical systems on legacy
operating systems (some as old as Windows NT 4) and applications, all on legacy hardware.
This is one of the riskiest configurations possible—not only are these operating systems and
applications insecure, if that hardware fails, backups typically cannot be restored on modern
hardware. Unless replacement legacy hardware is available, these applications will cease to
function.

Post-incident activities
DART recommends implementing the following security recommendations and best practices
after each incident.

5/8

Ensure that best practices are in place for email and collaboration solutions to make it
more difficult for attackers to abuse them while allowing internal users to access
external content easily and safely.
Follow Zero Trust security best practices for remote access solutions to internal
organizational resources.
Starting with critical impact administrators, follow best practices for account security
including using passwordless or MFA.
Implement a comprehensive strategy to reduce the risk of privileged access
compromise.
For cloud and forest/domain administrative access, see below for an overview of
Microsoft’s privileged access model (PAM).
For endpoint administrative management, see below for details on the local
administrative password solution (LAPS).
Implement data protection to block ransomware techniques and to confirm rapid and
reliable recovery from an attack.
Review your critical systems. Check for protection and backups against deliberate
attacker erasure/encryption. It’s important that these backups are periodically tested
and validated.
Ensure rapid detection and remediation of common attacks on endpoint, email, and
identity.
Actively discover and continuously improve the security posture of your environment.
Update organizational processes to manage major ransomware events and streamline
outsourcing to avoid friction.

Privileged access model (PAM)
Using the privileged access model (formerly known as the tiered administration model)
enhances Azure AD’s security posture. This involves:
Breaking out administrative accounts in a “Planed” environment—one account for each
level, usually four:
Control Plane (formerly Tier 0): Administration of Domain Controllers and other
crucial identity services (like Active Directory Federation Service (ADFS) or Azure
AD Connect). This also includes applications that require administrative
permissions to Active Directory, such as Exchange Server.
The next two Planes were formerly Tier 1:
Management Plane: Asset management, monitoring, and security.
Data/Workload Plane: Applications and application servers.
The next two Planes were formerly Tier 2:
User Access: Access rights for users (such as accounts).
App Access: Access rights for applications.

6/8

Each one of these Planes will have a separate administrative workstation for each
Plane and will only have access to systems in that Plane. Other accounts from other
Planes will be denied access to workstations and servers in the other Planes through
user rights assignments set to those machines.
The net result of the PAM is that:
A compromised user account will only have access to the Plane it is a part of.
More sensitive user accounts will not be logging into workstations and servers
with a lower Plane’s security level, thereby reducing lateral movement.

Local Administrative Password Solution (LAPS)
By default, Microsoft Windows and Active Directory have no centralized management of local
administrative accounts on workstations and member servers. This usually results in a
common password that is given for all these local accounts, or at the very least in groups of
machines. This enables would-be attackers to compromise one local administrator account,
and then use that account to gain access to other workstations or servers in the organization.
Microsoft’s Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) mitigates this by using a Group
Policy client-side extension that changes the local administrative password at regular
intervals on workstations and servers according to the policy set. Each of these passwords
are different and stored as an attribute in the Active Directory computer object. This attribute
can be retrieved from a simple client application, depending on the permissions assigned to
that attribute.
LAPS requires the Active Directory schema to be extended to allow for the additional
attribute, the LAPS Group Policy templates to be installed, and a small client-side extension
to be installed on every workstation and member server to provide the client-side
functionality.
Download LAPS from the official Microsoft Download Center.

Harden your environment
Each ransomware case is different and there is no one-size-fits-all approach. But there are
things you can do now to harden your environment and prepare for a worst-case scenario.
Although, these changes may impact how your organization currently works, consider the
risk of not implementing them now versus dealing with a potential human-operated
ransomware event. An organization that has fallen victim to a ransomware attack should
keep the crucial human element in mind—real people are responding to the incident at the
end of the day.
