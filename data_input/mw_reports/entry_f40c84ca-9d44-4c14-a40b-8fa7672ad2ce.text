The war in Ukraine appears to have triggered a change in mission for the APT known as
Bronze President (aka Mustang Panda).

China's tacit support for Russia's war in Ukraine apparently doesn't preclude likely Chinabacked cyber actors from mounting espionage campaigns on the Russian military.

1/3

Researchers from Secureworks' Counter Threat Unit this week said they recently
discovered malware that suggests the advanced persistent threat (APT) known as Bronze
President (aka Mustang Panda) is now targeting Russian military personnel and officials.
The security vendor described the effort as an example of how political changes can push
countries into new territory for surreptitious information-gathering efforts, even against
friends and allies.
Cyberespionage Campaign Delivers PlugX
According to the report, the heavily obfuscated malicious executable being used in the
campaign is designed to appear as a Russian-language PDF document pertaining to
Russia's 56th Blagoveshchenskiy Red Banner Border Guard Detachment (which is
deployed near Russia's border with China). The file is designed so that default Windows
settings do not display its .exe extension, Secureworks said.
Secureworks also explained that the executable file displays a decoy document written in
English, though the filename itself is in Russian. The document appears to be legitimate
and contains data pertaining to asylum applications and migratory pressure in the three
countries that border Belarus — Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia. The content also includes
commentary on European Union sanctions against Belarus for its role in the war in Ukraine.
When executed, the file downloads three additional files from a staging server. One of them
is a legitimate signed file from Global Graphics Software, a UK-based firm. The file uses
DLL search-order hijacking to import an updated version of PlugX, a remote-access Trojan
(RAT) that has been previously associated with Bronze President.
"DLL search-order hijacking has been around for years," says Mike McLellan, director of
intelligence at Secureworks. "It's a well-known technique by threat actors in which they
maliciously use a legitimate executable file, often from a well-known vendor, together with a
malicious library file (DLL), to load and execute an encrypted malware payload."
Threat actors use the technique because it ensures that the malicious payload file on a
compromised system is never sitting around on disk in a manner that scanners and antimalware can detect.
"This technique has been a staple of several China-nexus threat groups for many years,"
McLellan says.
As part of the attack chain, the threat actors have also included a ping command that adds
a significant delay before executing the legitimate signed file, Secureworks said — a
generic evasion technique to introduce a time lag while files are downloaded to the victim.
The staging server that Secureworks observed the threat actor using in the current
campaign hosts a domain that Proofpoint earlier this year linked to a PlugX campaign
against diplomatic entities in Europe. The security vendor determined that campaign to be
2/3

motivated by matters related to the war in Ukraine as well. The same domain has also been
linked to Bronze President attacks in 2020 that Secureworks observed against the Vatican.
A New Set of Victims for Bronze Panda
Bronze President is a threat group that has been active since at least 2018, according to
the researchers. Secureworks and others have assessed the group as being China-based
and likely sponsored by — or operating with the knowledge of — the Chinese government.
The group has been associated with numerous attacks on nongovernmental organizations
and others, mostly in Asia but to some extent in other countries. Last year, for example,
researchers from McAfee spotted the threat actor conducting a major cyber espionage
operation targeting telecommunication companies in the US, Asia, and Europe.
The latest campaign represents a departure from the usual for the group, since it targets
Russian entities, according to McLellan: "This is substantially different to what we have
seen over the past two years where Bronze President has been about 90% focused on
Myanmar and Vietnam. We believe they still have a mission in the Asia region, but this has
been a bit of a departure for them."
