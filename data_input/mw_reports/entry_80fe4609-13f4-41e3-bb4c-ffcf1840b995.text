INTRODUCTION
I infected a Windows host with the Trickbot malware from 2018-02-01 mentioned in this blog
post from My Online Security. I extracted the Trickbot binary located in a pcap from the
Any.run analysis of the associated malicious Word document.
The chain of events led from the email to --> link to a Word document --> enable Word
document macro --> Smoke Loader --> Trickbot.

1/7

Shown above: Trickbot binary extracted from the Any.run pcap.
I wanted to see what the Trickbot binary was doing, since I haven't looked at it in a while.
This blog post only reviews traffic and artifacts from a Windows host infected with the
Trickbot binary, SHA256 hash

TRICKBOT TRAFFIC
Trickbot network traffic in February 2018 are similar to what I in this ISC diary I wrote in
August 2017. The only difference is a Monero cryptocurrency miner (coin miner) in postinfection traffic in February 2018, which I hadn't noticed before.

2/7

Shown above: Trickbot traffic (from the Trickbot binary) on 2018-02-01.
Trickbot SSL traffic is somewhat similar to what we've seen with Dridex SSL traffic in recent
weeks. Today's Trickbot traffic triggered Emerging Threats alerts for ET TROJAN
ABUSE.CH SSL Blacklist Malicious SSL certificates detected (Dridex CnC), which I've seen
with Trickbot traffic before. More importantly, rules from the Snort subscriber's ruleset
detected Trickbot SSL certificates, which better fits what I saw on 2018-02-01.

Shown above: Snort alerts on Trickbot certificates in SSL traffic.

3/7

Shown above: Emerging Threats alerts on the infection traffic from Sguil using
Suricata on Security Onion.

Shown above: Post-infection traffic caused by malware based on Monero (XMRig)
coin miner.

FORENSICS ON THE INFECTED WINDOWS HOST
My Trickbot binary was named 2018-02-01-Trickbot-malware-sample.exe, and I ran it from
the user's AppData\Local\Temp directory. As we saw with Trickbot back in August 2017,
the malware copied itself to a new folder in the user's AppData\Roaming directory. Today's
file was re-named, with some (but not all) of the characters in the file name shifted one
character. Like we saw back in August 2017, there's a file named group_tag. This time, it
contained the text: 3101uk. Below are images showing some of the artifacts.

4/7

Shown above: Artifacts on the infected Windows host.

5/7

Shown above: Per @VK_Intel, decoded Worm32Dll module is a Monero coin miner
(link).

FINAL WORDS
Looks like Trickbot has changed a bit since I last examined it. Traffic and artifacts familiar,
but Trickbot has apparently jumped on the cryptocurrency bandwagon by adding a Monero
(XMRig) coin mining module. I imagine someone will do a more in-depth write-up on the
new Trickbot, but I wanted to get some traffic and malware samples out.
