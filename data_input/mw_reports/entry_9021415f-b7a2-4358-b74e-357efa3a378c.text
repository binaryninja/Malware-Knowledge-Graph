Strategic web compromises in the Middle East with a pinch of Candiru

November 16, 2021

Back in 2018, ESET researchers developed a custom in-house system to uncover watering hole attacks (aka
strategic web compromises) on high-profile websites. On July 11th, 2020 it notified us that the website of the
Iranian embassy in Abu Dhabi had been modified and had started injecting JavaScript code from
https://piwiks[.]com/reconnect.js, as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Script injection on the website of the Iranian Embassy in Abu Dhabi

Our curiosity was aroused by the nature of the targeted website and in the following weeks we noticed that other
websites with connections to the Middle East started to be targeted. We traced the start of the campaign back to
March 2020, when the piwiks[.]com domain was re-registered. We believe that the strategic web compromises
only started in April 2020 when the website of the Middle East Eye (middleeasteye.net), a London-based digital
news site covering the region, started to inject code from the piwiks[.]com domain.
At the end of July or the beginning of August 2020, all remaining compromised websites were cleaned; it is
probable that the attackers themselves removed the malicious scripts from the compromised websites. The threat
group went quiet until January 2021, when we observed a new wave of compromises. This second wave lasted
until August 2021, when all websites were cleaned again. A few indicators from this second wave were shared on
Twitter by a fellow researcher, which allows us to make a link with what Kaspersky tracks as Karkadann.
We detail the inner working of the compromises in the Technical analysis section, below, but it is worth noting
that the final targets are specific visitors of those websites, who are likely to receive a browser exploit. The
compromised websites are only used as a hop to reach the final targets.
We also uncovered interesting links with Candiru, detailed in the section Links between the watering holes,
spearphishing documents and Candiru. Candiru is a private Israeli spyware firm that was recently added to the
Entity List (entities subject to licensing restrictions) of the US Department of Commerce. This may prevent any
US‑based organization from doing business with Candiru without first obtaining a license from the Department of
Commerce.

At the time of writing, it seems that the operators are taking a pause, probably in order to retool and make their
campaign stealthier. We expect to see them back in the ensuing months.

Targeting
Our tracking shows that the operators are mostly interested in the Middle East, with a particular emphasis on
Yemen. Table 1 shows the known targets in 2020 and 2021.

However, it seems it
was taken over by the
Southern Transitional
Council in early June
2021, just before this
website was
compromised.

medica-tradefair[.]co is the outlier in this list, as it was not compromised but was operated by the attackers
themselves. It was hosted at ServerAstra, as were all the other C&C servers used in 2020.
It mimics the legitimate website medica-tradefair.com, which is the website of the World Forum for Medicine’s
MEDICA Trade Fair held in Düsseldorf (Germany) each year. The operators simply cloned the original website
and added a small piece of JavaScript code.
As seen in Figure 2, the content doesn’t seem to have been modified. It is likely that attackers were not able to
compromise the legitimate website and had to set up a fake one in order to inject their malicious code.

It is interesting to note that the malicious domains mimic genuine web analytics, URL shortener or content
delivery network domains and URLs. This is a characteristic of this threat actor.

Technical analysis – Strategic web compromises
First wave – 2020
First stage – Injected script
All compromised websites were injecting JavaScript code from the attacker-controlled domains piwiks[.]com and
rebrandly[.]site. In the first known case, the injection is as shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3. Script injection on the website of the Iranian Embassy in Abu Dhabi

This injection loads a remote JavaScript named reconnects.js and a legitimate third-party library, GeoJS, for IP
geolocation lookup.
In the cases of rebrandly[.]site injections, the additional scripts are loaded using HTML script tags, as seen in
Figure 4.

Figure 4. Script injected into the medica-tradefair[.]co website

Second stage – Fingerprinting script
reconnects.js and recon-api.js are almost identical; only the order of some lines or functions are changed. As
shown in Figure 5, the malware authors tried to avoid raising suspicions by prepending their script with a copy of
the jQuery Browser Plugin header. They were probably hoping that malware analysts would not scroll further.

Figure 5. Beginning of the fingerprinting script used in the first wave

The script first implements a function named geoip. It is automatically called by the GeoJS library, previously
loaded, as mentioned on the official GeoJS website. The variable json contains the IP geolocation information. The
script sends this JSON via an HTTP POST request to the C&C server at the URL
https://rebrandly[.]site/reconnect-api.php. If the server returns an HTTP 200 status code, then the script
proceeds to a function named main.
First, main gathers information such as the operating system version and the browser version using custom
functions shown in Figure 6. They simply parse the browser User-Agent to extract information.

Figure 6. OS and browser fingerprinting functions

As shown in Figure 7, the function then checks whether the operating system is either Windows or macOS and
only continues if so. This is interesting because it suggests that this operation is intended to compromise
computers and not mobile devices such as smartphones. It also checks for a list of common web browsers:
Chrome, Firefox, Opera, IE, Safari and Edge.

Figure 7. The main function of the fingerprinting script used in the first wave

The script also encrypts a hardcoded value, 1122, although we don’t know for what purpose. Despite the function
being named decrypt, it actually encrypts using RSA and the library JSEncrypt. The 1024-bit RSA key is
hardcoded and set to:

Then, the script sends an HTTPS GET request to the C&C server rebrandly[.]site. The id parameter contains the
fingerprint data and the last parameter value contains the country provided by the GeoJS library.
If the server returns a reply, it is decrypted using AES from the CryptoJS library, and a hardcoded key
flcwsfjWCWEcoweijwf@#$@#$@#499299234@#$!@2. This key stayed the same, even after we tried a few
requests.
The decrypted value is supposedly a URL and a new iframe pointing to this URL is created. We were unable to get
any valid answer but we believe it leads to a browser remote code execution exploit that allows an attacker to take
control of a machine.

Second wave – 2021
In January 2021, a new wave of attacks started. The attackers created an entirely new network infrastructure and
changed all their JavaScript code.
First stage – Injected script
In order to be a bit stealthier still, in this second wave, they started to modify scripts that were already on the
compromised website. So instead of adding code to the main HTML page, they modified libraries such as
wp-embed.min.js, as seen in Figure 8. They simply added a few lines at the end of
https://www.smc.gov.ye/wp-includes/js/wp-embed.min.js to load a script from a server they control:
https://visitortrack[.]net/sliders.js.

Figure 8. Injected script used in the second wave

Another strategy used to limit their exposure is to create a cookie the first time the visitor executes the malicious
script, as shown in Figure 9. As the script is conditionally injected depending on whether the cookie already exists,
this will prevent further injections. This specific code was found on the website of the Syrian Central Authority for
the [sic] Supervision and Inspection (casi.gov.sy).

Figure 9. Cookie creation to avoid further requests

Second stage
From January to March 2021, for the second-stage script, the operators used a script based on the minAjax
library. This is not a fingerprinting script per se as it doesn’t send any information about the browser or the
operating system to the C&C server – an example is shown in Figure 10. It should be noted that very similar scripts
are used by the LNKR adware, so a detection on this might lead to a high volume of false positives.

Figure 10. Second-stage script of the second wave

This script contains the current timestamp, t0, an expiration timestamp, ex, and two hashes juh and cs, whose
significance we don’t know at present. These values are sent to the C&C server https://webfex[.]bz/f/gstats. If the
reply is a JSON object and contains the fw key, the script issues a redirection to the URL contained in fw using
parent.top.window.location.href. As with the first wave, we were not able to get any valid redirect.
In April 2021, this script was changed to FingerprintJS Pro. This is a commercial product whose developers have
an official website shown in Figure 11.

Figure 11. Home page of FingerprintJS

In comparison to the fingerprinting script used in 2020, this is far more complex because it retrieves the default
language, the list of fonts supported by the browser, the time zone, the list of browser plugins, the local IP
addresses using RTCPeerConnection, and so on. Network communications with the C&C server are encrypted with
an AES session key. As shown in Figure 12, the server can return JavaScript code that will be executed in the
context of the current web page.

Figure 12. FingerprintJS Pro adds JavaScript code to the current page

As with the previous cases, we never got a valid redirect. We still believe it leads to a browser exploit and it shows
that this campaign is highly targeted.

Spearphishing documents and links with Candiru
Reminder of the Citizen Lab publication

Strategic web compromises in the Middle East with a pinch of Candiru | WeLiveSecurity

In the Citizen Lab Candiru blogpost, there is a section called A Saudi-Linked Cluster?. It mentions a
spearphishing document that was uploaded to VirusTotal.
The C&C server used by this document is https://cuturl[.]space/lty7uw and VirusTotal captured a redirection
from this URL to https://useproof[.]cc/1tUAE7A2Jn8WMmq/api. The domain useproof[.]cc was resolving to
109.70.236[.]107 and, according to the Citizen Lab, this server matched their so-called CF3 fingerprint for Candiru
C&C servers. This domain was registered via Porkbun, as are most Candiru-owned domains.
Two domains resolving to the same IP address caught our attention:
webfx[.]cc
engagebay[.]cc
The same second-level domains, with a different TLD, were used in the second wave of strategic web
compromises. These two domains in the .cc TLD are most likely operated by Candiru too.
The Citizen Lab report mentions a few domains similar to cuturl[.]space, which we detail in Table 2.

These domain names mimic URL shorteners and the Instagram social media website and were registered through
Njalla and TLD Registrar Solutions Ltd. This reminds us of the domains used for the strategic web compromises
that are all variations of genuine web analytics websites and were also registered via Njalla.
We also independently confirmed that the servers to which these domains were resolving were configured in a
similar fashion.
Thus, we believe that this set of websites is controlled by the same threat group that created the documents.
Conversely, the domain useproof[.]cc is most likely operated in-house by Candiru and is used to deliver exploits.

Candiru

What is interesting to note is that the watering holes are limited to a quite narrow victimology. We also noted that
domains known to be operated by Candiru (webfx[.]cc for example) are very similar to domains used for the
watering holes (webfx[.]bz). However, they were not registered in the same fashion and their servers are
configured very differently.
In July 2021, Google published a blogpost providing details on exploits used by Candiru. It includes CVE‑202121166 and CVE-2021-30551 for Chrome and CVE-2021-33742 for Internet Explorer. They are full remote code
execution exploits that allow an attacker to take control of a machine by making the victim visit a specific URL that
then delivers the exploit. This shows Candiru has the capabilities to exploit browsers in a watering hole attack.
Hence, we believe that the watering holes behave similarly to the documents. The first C&C server, injected in the
compromised websites, would redirect to another C&C server, owned by a spyware firm such as Candiru and
delivering a browser exploit.
Based on this information, we assess:
with low confidence that the creators of the documents and the operators of the watering holes are the same.
with medium confidence that the operators of the watering holes are customers of Candiru.

Conclusion
This report describes two strategic web compromise campaigns targeting high-profile organizations in the Middle
East, with a strong focus on Yemen. We also revealed links to Candiru, a spyware firm, that sells state‑of‑the‑art
offensive software tools and related services to government agencies.
We were unable to get an exploit and the final payload. This shows that the operators choose to narrow the focus
of their operations and that they don’t want to burn their zero-day exploits.
We stopped seeing activity from this operation at the end of July 2021, shortly after the release of blogposts by the
Citizen Lab, Google and Microsoft detailing the activities of Candiru.
A comprehensive list of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and samples can be found in our GitHub repository.
