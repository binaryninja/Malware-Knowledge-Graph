New HTML Smuggling Attack Alert: Duri

HTML smuggling campaign is stopped by the Menlo Security Cloud Platform
Menlo Security has been closely monitoring an attack we are naming “Duri.” Duri leverages
HTML smuggling to deliver malicious files to users’ endpoints by evading network security
solutions such as sandboxes and legacy proxies. Isolation prevents this attack from infecting
the endpoint. Here’s what we know.

What Is HTML Smuggling ?
The goal of HTML smuggling is to make use of HTML5/JavaScript features to deliver file
downloads, and it usually comes in two flavors:
Deliver the download via Data URLs on the client device.
Create a Javascript blob with the appropriate MIME-type that results in a download on
the client device.
In this specific attack, we observed the JavaScript blob technique being used to smuggle
malicious files via the browser to the user’s endpoint. Constructing content on the client
browser like this evades network security solutions such as sandboxes and proxies.

What is Duri?

1/8

According to our observations, the Duri campaign started in the beginning of July and is
currently active. Earlier this month, we identified a user’s visit to a website and subsequent
file download, which was blocked because it was suspicious. Upon investigation, we
discovered that the file was downloaded through HTML smuggling.
Traditional network security solutions such as proxies, firewalls, and sandboxes rely on the
transfer of objects over the wire. For example, a sandbox might extract file objects such as
.exe, .zip, and other suspicious objects from the wire and then send them to the sandbox for
detonation. With Duri, the entire payload is constructed on the client side (browser), so no
objects are transferred over the wire for the sandbox to inspect.

What tactics does Duri use?
The malware that Duri downloads is not new. According to Cisco, it has previously been
delivered via Dropbox, but the attackers have now displaced Dropbox with other cloud
hosting providers and have blended in the HTML smuggling technique to infect endpoints.
We speculate that this change in tactic is being used to increase the success rate of
compromised endpoints.
Landing Page
Once the user clicks on the link, there are multiple levels of redirection before the user lands
on an HTML page hosted on duckdns[.]org. The landing page invokes a JavaScript onload
that initializes data for a blob object from a base64 encoded variable as shown below.

As seen above, a ZIP file is dynamically constructed from the blob object with MIME type as
octet/stream and is downloaded to the endpoint. The user still needs to open the ZIP file and
execute it.
Malicious MSI Dropper
The ZIP archive contains an MSI file [T1218.007]. The .msi file extension indicates that the
file is a Microsoft Windows installer and contains the application and all of its dependencies.
unzip PUVG OKZAGE SBKZXONA ETRWDDQGBL .zip
Archive: PUVG OKZAGE SBKZXONA ETRWDDQGBL .zip
inflating: PUVG OKZAGE SBKZXONA ETRWDDQGBL (869261) .msi

file PUVG OKZAGE SBKZXONA ETRWDDQGBL (869261) .msi
PUVG OKZAGE SBKZXONA ETRWDDQGBL (869261) .msi: Composite Document File V2
Document, Little Endian, Os: Windows.
Examining the MSI file shows that there is an execute script code action defined in the
custom action of the MSI contents:

Microsoft JSCRIPT Analysis

3/8

The embedded JSCRIPT is obfuscated, and it performs the following actions upon invoke:
Fetches a ZIP file from a remote location:
hxxp://104[.]214[.]115[.]159/mod/input20[.]jpg
The extension in the URL is .jpg, but it is a ZIP file.
The ZIP file is downloaded to the Public Documents folder and two files are extracted
from the ZIP archive: Avira.exe and rundll.exe.
The Avira.exe file is renamed to a randomly named EXE file. The rundll.exe file is
renamed to a randomly named file with a .bmp extension.
A LNK file gets created in the %appdata% (roaming) folder, and the target of the LNK
file is set to a randomly renamed Avira.exe file [T1547.009].
It achieves persistence by creating an autorun key for the above LNK file [T1547.001].
The final command that gets run is [T1059.001]:
powershell.exe cd;cd ‘C:UsersJohn SmithAppDataRoamingMicrosoftWindowsStart
MenuProgramsStartup’;Start-Sleep -s 60;Start-Process ‘YOUXQNWXME.lnk’
The extracted Avira.exe file was a signed ~500MB file from Avira, which was
present with a rundll.exe, and there was no evidence of process injection or sideloading techniques observed that could be used to further analyze and examine
the behavior.

How does Menlo Security get visibility into Duri?

4/8

While traditional security solutions rely on a detect-and-respond approach to cybersecurity,
Menlo enables a Zero Trust approach by forcing a block-or-isolate decision at the point of
click. All content is fetched and executed in a remote browser and is cut off from the
endpoint, while only safe mirrored content reaches the user’s device. This prevents malware
from accessing the endpoint.
Campaigns like Duri, in which JavaScript is used to programmatically and dynamically
generate the malicious payload, cannot evade the Menlo platform. Downloading files via
Menlo is a two-step process. Every file download in the isolated browser triggers a unique
event on our platform—whether it’s because of a DataURL, a JavaScript blob download, or a
link. As a result, the Menlo platform enables enhanced visibility into the contents of every file.
Attackers are constantly tweaking their tactics in an effort to evade and bypass security
solutions—forcing tools that rely on a detect-and-respond approach to always play catch-up.
We believe HTML smuggling is one such technique that will be incorporated into the
attackers’ arsenal and used more often to deliver the payload to the endpoint without
network solutions blocking it. Menlo’s isolation approach prevents all content from reaching
the endpoint—effectively blocking all malware without impacting the native user experience.
It’s security without compromise.
