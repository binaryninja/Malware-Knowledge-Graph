By Alex Hinchliffe

October 3, 2019

Executive Summary
For three years, Unit 42 has tracked a set of cyber espionage attack campaigns across Asia,
which used a mix of publicly available and custom malware. Unit 42 created the moniker
“PKPLUG” for the threat actor group, or groups, behind these and other documented attacks
referenced later in this report. We say group or groups as our current visibility doesn’t allow us to
determine with high conﬁdence if this is the work of one group, or more than one group which
uses the same tools and has the same tasking. The name comes from the tactic of delivering
PlugX malware inside ZIP archive ﬁles as part of a DLL side-loading package. The ZIP ﬁle format
contains the ASCII magic-bytes “PK” in its header, hence PKPLUG.
While tracking these attackers, Unit 42 discovered additional, mostly custom malware families
being used by PKPLUG beyond that of just PlugX. The additional payloads include HenBox, an
Android app, and Farseer, a Windows backdoor. The attackers also use the 9002 Trojan, which is
believed to be shared among a small subset of attack groups. Other publicly available malware
seen in relation to PKPLUG activity includes Poison Ivy and Zupdax.
During our investigations and research into these attacks, we were able to relate previous attacks
documented by others that date back as far back as six years ago. Unit 42 incorporates these
ﬁndings, together with our own, under the moniker PKPLUG and continue to track accordingly.
It’s not entirely clear as to the ultimate objectives of PKPLUG, but installing backdoor Trojan
implants on victim systems, including mobile devices, infers tracking victims and gathering
information is a key goal.

PKPLUG: Chinese Cyber Espionage Group Attacking Asia

We believe victims lay mainly in and around the Southeast Asia region, particularly Myanmar,
Taiwan, Vietnam, and Indonesia; and likely also in various other areas in Asia, such as Tibet,
Xinjiang, and Mongolia. Based on targeting, content in some of the malware and ties to
infrastructure previously documented publicly as being linked to Chinese nation-state adversaries,
Unit 42 believes with high conﬁdence that PKPLUG has similar origins.

Targeting
Based on our visibility into PKPLUG’s campaigns and what we’ve learned from collaborating with
industry partners, we believe victims lay mainly in and around the Southeast Asia region.
Speciﬁcally, the target countries/provinces include (with higher conﬁdence), Myanmar and Taiwan
as well as (with lower conﬁdence), Vietnam and Indonesia. Other areas in Asia targeted include
Mongolia, Tibet and Xinjiang. This blog, and the associated Adversary Playbook, provides further
details including: the methods used for malware delivery, the social engineering topics of decoy
applications and documents and the Command & Control (C2) infrastructure themes.
Indonesia, Myanmar and Vietnam are ASEAN members, contributing towards intergovernmental
cooperation in the region. Mongolia, speciﬁcally the independent country also known as Outer
Mongolia, has a long-standing and complex relationship with the PRC. Tibet and Xinjiang are
autonomous regions (AR) of China that tend to be classiﬁed by China’s ethnic minorities, granted
the ability to govern themselves but ultimately answering to the People’s Republic of China
(PRC). Tibet and Xinjiang are the only ARs, from ﬁve, where the ethnic group maintains a majority
over other populations.
Most, if not all, of the seven countries or regions, are involved in some way with Beijing’s Belt and
Road Initiative (BRI) designed to connect 71 countries across Southeast Asia to Eastern Europe
and Africa. The path through Xinjiang is especially important to the BRI’s success, but is more
often heard of due to conﬂicts between the Chinese government and the ethnic Uyghur
population. News of the BRI is peppered with stories of success and failure, of countries for and
against the BRI and of countries pulling out of existing BRI projects.
Further tensions in the region are attributed to ownership claims over the South China Sea,
including ﬁshing quotas and the yet unproven oil and gas reserves. At least three of the target
countries mentioned (Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam) have laid claim to parts of these waters, and
some use the area for the vast majority of their trade. Foriegn militaries also patrol, attempting to
keep the area open.
Taiwan, which isn’t an AR and doesn’t appear to be actively involved with the BRI, has its own
long-standing history with the PRC — a recent $2.2 billion arms sale with the U.S. may
exacerbate matters.

Timeline
Before continuing, it’s worth highlighting our research and others relating to the intrusion set that
we refer to as PKPLUG. This section documents prior work surrounding cyber attacks relating to
PKPLUG. The following ﬁgure illustrates the chronological order of the publications — highlighting
some key ﬁndings from each.

PKPLUG: Chinese Cyber Espionage Group Attacking Asia

As you can see from the timeline, PKPLUG has been active for six years or more with a variety of
targets and methods of delivery and compromise.

Figure 1. Timeline of publications and key ﬁndings relating to PKPLUG
Please note: the dates shown on the horizontal timeline bar in Figure 1 above relate to the
publishing date, not the campaign dates, although some were fairly close together. As an
example to illustrate the difference in dates, HenBox was discovered in 2018 but has samples
ranging from 2015 through to this week. PlugX and Poison Ivy are still doing the rounds and their
use by different groups is well known. Whether they relate to PKPLUG is another matter.
#1: In November 2013, Blue Coat Labs published a report describing a case of attacks against
Mongolian targets using PlugX malware. Like so many other attacks using PlugX over the past
decade or more, Blue Coat noted the DLL side-loading technique used to launch the malicious
payload via legitimate, signed applications. Their report also documented the group’s use of an
exploit against software vulnerabilities in Microsoft Ofﬁce. In this case, using a weaponized Word
document saved as a Single File Web Page format — usually having an mht ﬁle extension — in
order to exploit CVE-2012-0158 to drop and execute a signed WinRAR SFX archive containing
the side-loading package and PlugX payload. Considering all the malware related to PKPLUG
that Unit 42 has analyzed, the use of such exploits appears to be less common than a spearphishing technique making use of social engineering to lure victims into running their malware.
#2: A report published in April 2016 by Arbor Networks detailed recent cyber attacks using Poison
Ivy malware against targets in Myanmar and other countries in Asia over the previous twelve
months.
They noted phishing emails using ASEAN membership, economics and democracy-related topics
to weaponize documents delivering the Poison Ivy payloads. While Arbor didn’t know the exact
victims, they inferred suspect targets based on the content of emails and associated malware.
DLL side-loading was also mentioned as the method to install the malware.
#3: Unit 42 published research that reported attacks using the 9002 Trojan delivered through
Google Drive. The download originated with a spear-phishing email containing a shortened URL
that redirected multiple times before downloading a ZIP ﬁle hosted on Google Drive. The

redirection using HTTP also contains information about the victim who received the spear-phish
and clicked the link. In this case, the information related to a well-known politician and human
rights activist in Myanmar. The ﬁlename of the ZIP archive also related to initiatives in the country,
as did the decoy document contents. The ZIP ﬁle contained a DLL side-loading package abusing
a Real Player executable signed by RealNetworks, Inc. in order to load the 9002 payload.
#4: In March 2017, researchers published a report in Japanese (later translated into English) that
described attacks seen by VKRL — a Hong Kong-based cybersecurity company — that were
using spear-phishing emails with URLs using GeoCities Japan to deliver malware. The content of
the website contained encoded VBScript that executed PowerShell commands to download a
Microsoft Word document from the same GeoCities site, as well as another encoded PowerShell
script closely resembling PowerSploit — a PowerShell post-exploitation framework for pentesters
that’s available on GitHub — that was responsible for decoding and launching a Poison Ivy
payload.
Another GeoCities account was found hosting similar packages, including one targeting Mongolia
based on the contents of the decoy documents. The contents of the ﬁle, assuming a victim clicked
on the URL in the spear-phishing email, resembles the structure used in a technique known as
AppLocker Bypass whereby trusted Windows executables can be used to execute malicious
payloads.
#5: In early 2018, Unit 42 discovered a new Android malware family that we named “HenBox” and
is tracking over 400 related samples dating back as far as late 2015, and continuing to present
day. HenBox often masquerades as legitimate Android apps and appears to primarily target the
Uyghurs — a minority Turkic ethnic group that is primarily Muslim and lives mainly in the Xinjiang
Uyghur Autonomous Region in Northwest China and also targets devices made by Chinese
manufacturer Xiaomi.
Smartphones are the dominant form of internet access in the region and hence make good
targets for such malware. Once installed, HenBox steals information from a myriad of sources on
the device including harvesting outgoing phone calls to numbers with an “+86” preﬁx — the
country code for the PRC — and accessing the device microphone and cameras.
During investigations, data revealed an older version of HenBox had been downloaded from the
uyghurapps[.]net website, which appears to be third-party Android app store serving the Uyghur
community based on the domain name, language of the site and app content hosted. HenBox
was masquerading as an another app — DroidVPN — which was also embedded within HenBox
and installed post-infection.
#6: Based on further investigations and pivoting around HenBox infrastructure, Unit 42 discovered
a previously-unknown Windows backdoor Trojan called Farseer. Farseer also uses the DLL sideloading technique to install payloads — this time favoring a signed Microsoft executable from
VisualStudio to appear benign. A VBScript component is used, via a registry persistence hook, to
launch the Microsoft executable and the Farseer payload during the user login process. In earlier
Farseer variants, we saw decoy documents being used, including one case of a PDF containing a
news article relating to Myanmar. Mongolia also appears to be a target based on telemetry
provided by an industry partner of ours.

Tying It All Together
The following Maltego image shows the vast majority of known infrastructure and some of the
known malware samples related to PKPLUG, and the chart continues to grow as we discover
more about this adversary. The indexed shapes that overlay the ﬁgure provide a reference back
to the published work chronology mentioned above.

Figure 2. PKPLUG Maltego diagram highlighting published research
Overlaps between the different campaigns documented, and the malware families used in them,
exist both in infrastructure (domain names and IP addresses being reused, sometimes in multiple
cases) and in terms of malicious traits (program runtime behaviors or static code characteristics
are also where relationships can be found or strengthened).
Figure 3 below shows a very simpliﬁed view of the six core publications again, as per Figure 2
above, but with trimmed-down infrastructure to highlight some of the core overlaps.

Figure 3. Simpliﬁed Maltego diagram showing high-level ties
The C2 infrastructure blogged by Blue Coat Labs in their publication (#1) “PlugX used against
Mongolian targets” included ppt.bodologetee[.]com has infrastructure ties microsoftwarer[.]com
through a shared IPv4 with parent domain bodologetee[.]com. Domain microsoftwarer[.]com was
found after threat hunting based on facts provided in publication (#4) “”FHAPPI” Campaign:
FreeHosting APT PowerSploit Poison Ivy” in relation to the FHAPPI campaign.
The FHAPPI campaign (#4) was documented as using PowerShell and PowerSploit code in order
to infect victims with Poison Ivy, but very similar code was also found around PlugX malware,
some of which had C2 communication with logitechwkgame[.]com. Domain
logitechwkgame[.]com was documented by Unit 42 in publication (#3) “Attack Delivers 9002
Trojan Through Google Drive” as the C2 for the 9002 Trojans analyzed. FHAPPI is also
connected through another malware using C2 infrastructure that relates, through a shared IPv4
address, to microsoftdefence[.]com, which malware documented in Arbor Networks’ publication
(#2) “Poison Ivy Activity Targeting Myanmar, Asian Countries” also used for C2 communication.
Other Poison Ivy samples also related to the campaigns documented by Arbor Networks used
domain webserver.servehttp[.]com for C2 communication. Said samples also shared overlaps in
runtime characteristics with other Poison Ivy samples that have been analyzed and conﬁrmed as
having C2 communications with certain domains that relate to both Blue Coat Labs’ publication
(#1) and Unit 42’s research into Farseer malware and their publication (#6) “Farseer: Previously
Unknown Malware Family bolsters the Chinese armoury”. Domains include
yahoomesseges[.]com and outhmail[.]com, tcpdo[.]net, queryurl[.]com and cdncool[.]com
respectively. The same registrant of yahoomesseges[.]com – mongolianews@yahoo[.]com – also
registered ppt.bodologetee[.]com mentioned slightly earlier.
Some HenBox malware has used domain cdncool[.]com as well for its C2 communications, as
documented in Unit 42’s publication (#5) “The Chickens Come Home to Roost.” Domain
cdncool[.]com is thus connected not only to HenBox and Farseer campaigns, but also, through
https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/pkplug_chinese_cyber_espionage_group_attacking_asia/

Poison Ivy malware, to the campaigns documented by Blue Coat Labs and Arbor Networks.
HenBox is also connected through a third-level domain update.queryurl[.]com to queryurl[.]com
that has been used for C2 communications by some Farseer samples.
Other overlaps, mainly in infrastructure also exist (as seen in Figure 2 above) but are difﬁcult to
describe in a blog like this, hence using Maltego. Figure 3, as mentioned earlier, is a simpliﬁed
diagram to highlight some core overlaps.

PKPLUG’s Adversary Playbook
Unit 42 has previously described and published Adversary Playbooks you can view using our
Playbook Viewer. To recap brieﬂy, Adversary Playbooks provide a Threat Intelligence package in
STIX 2.0 that include all IoCs for known attacks by a given adversary. In addition, said packages
also include structured information about attack campaigns and adversary behaviours — their
TTPs) — described using Mitre’s ATT&CK framework.
The Adversary Playbook for PKPLUG can be viewed here, and the STIX 2.0 content behind that
can be downloaded from here. The Playbook contains several Plays (aka campaigns; instances
of the Attack Lifecycle) that map, for the most part, to published research previously mentioned in
this blog. There exists Plays including speciﬁc details from publications by Blue Coat Labs, Arbor
Networks, our publication on the 9002 Trojan, and the FHAPPI campaign. HenBox has two Plays
— one for the known attack compromising a third-party app store to deliver the malware and
another containing all other HenBox data. A similar single campaign exists for Farseer containing
all related data.

Conclusion
Establishing a clear picture and understanding about a threat group, or groups, is virtually
impossible without total visibility into every one of their attack campaigns. Based on this, applying
a handle or moniker to a set of related data — such as network infrastructure, malware behavior,
actor TTPs relating to delivery, exﬁltration, etc. — helps us to better understand what it is we’re
investigating. Sharing this information — with a handle, in this case PKPLUG — especially in a
structured, codiﬁed manner a la Adversary Playbooks, should allow others to contribute their
vantage points and enrich said data until the understanding of a threat group becomes lucid.
Based on what we know and what we’ve gleaned from others’ publications, and through industry
sharing, PKPLUG is a threat group, or groups, operating for at least the last six years using
several malware families — some more well-known: Poison Ivy, PlugX, and Zupdax; some are
less well-known: 9002, HenBox, and Farseer. Unit 42 has been tracking the adversary for three
years and based on public reporting believes with high conﬁdence that it has origins to Chinese
nation-state adversaries. PKPLUG targets various countries or provinces in and around the
Southeast Asia region for multiple possible reasons as mentioned above, including some
countries that are members of the ASEAN organisation, some regions that are autonomous to
China, some countries and regions somewhat involved with China’s Belt and Road Initiative, and
ﬁnally, some countries that are embroiled in ownership claims over the South China Sea.
The Playbook Viewer helps to highlight some of the more common TTPs used by PKPLUG but,
based on our visibility, spear-phishing emails to deliver payloads to their victims is very popular.
Some email attachments contained exploits taking advantage of vulnerable Microsoft Ofﬁce

applications, however this technique was less commonly used compared with social engineering
to lure the victim into opening attachments. DLL side-loading seems almost ubiquitous as a
method to install or run their payloads, though perhaps more recently, PowerShell and
PowerSploit is also being considered. Other TTPs are described in the STIX 2.0 package and
presented in the Viewer.
The use of Android malware shows intent to get at targets where perhaps traditional computers,
operating systems and ways of communicating are different from previous targets.
