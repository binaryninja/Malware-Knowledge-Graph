MESSAGETAP: Who’s Reading Your Text Messages?
ﬁreeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/10/messagetap-who-is-reading-your-text-messages.html

FireEye Mandiant recently discovered a new malware family used by APT41 (a Chinese APT
group) that is designed to monitor and save SMS trafﬁc from speciﬁc phone numbers, IMSI
numbers and keywords for subsequent theft. Named MESSAGETAP, the tool was deployed by
APT41 in a telecommunications network provider in support of Chinese espionage efforts.
APT41’s operations have included state-sponsored cyber espionage missions as well as
ﬁnancially-motivated intrusions. These operations have spanned from as early as 2012 to the
present day. For an overview of APT41, see our August 2019 blog post or our full published
report. MESSAGETAP was ﬁrst reported to FireEye Threat Intelligence subscribers in August
2019 and initially discussed publicly in an APT41 presentation at FireEye Cyber Defense Summit
2019.

MESSAGETAP Overview
APT41's newest espionage tool, MESSAGETAP, was discovered during a 2019 investigation at a
telecommunications network provider within a cluster of Linux servers. Speciﬁcally, these Linux
servers operated as Short Message Service Center (SMSC) servers. In mobile networks, SMSCs
are responsible for routing Short Message Service (SMS) messages to an intended recipient or
storing them until the recipient has come online. With this background, let's dig more into the
malware itself.
MESSAGETAP is a 64-bit ELF data miner initially loaded by an installation script. Once installed,
the malware checks for the existence of two ﬁles: keyword_parm.txt and parm.txt and attempts to
read the conﬁguration ﬁles every 30 seconds. If either exist, the contents are read and XOR
decoded with the string:
http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/123000_123099/123040/04.02.00_60/ts_123040v040200p.pdf
Interestingly, this XOR key leads to a URL owned by the European
Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). The document explains the Short
Message Service (SMS) for GSM and UMTS Networks. It describes architecture as
well as requirements and protocols for SMS.
These two ﬁles, keyword_parm.txt and parm.txt contain instructions for MESSAGETAP to target
and save contents of SMS messages.
The ﬁrst ﬁle (parm.txt) is a ﬁle containing two lists:
imsiMap: This list contains International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) numbers.
IMSI numbers identify subscribers on a cellular network.
phoneMap: The phoneMap list contains phone numbers.
The second ﬁle (keyword_parm.txt) is a list of keywords that is read into keywordVec.

Both ﬁles are deleted from disk once the conﬁguration ﬁles are read and loaded into memory.
After loading the keyword and phone data ﬁles, MESSAGETAP begins monitoring all network
connections to and from the server. It uses the libpcap library to listen to all trafﬁc and parses
network protocols starting with Ethernet and IP layers. It continues parsing protocol layers
including SCTP, SCCP, and TCAP. Finally, the malware parses and extracts SMS message data
from the network trafﬁc:
1. SMS message contents
2. The IMSI number
3. The source and destination phone numbers
The malware searches the SMS message contents for keywords from the keywordVec list,
compares the IMSI number with numbers from the imsiMap list, and checks the extracted phone
numbers with the numbers in the phoneMap list.

If the SMS message text contains one of the keywordVec values, the contents are XORed and
saved to a path with the following format:
/etc/<redacted>/kw_<year><month><day>.csv

The malware compares the IMSI number and phone numbers with the values from the imsiMap
and phoneMap lists. If found, the malware XORs the contents and stores the data in a path with
the following format:
/etc/<redacted>/<year><month><day>.csv
If the malware fails to parse a message correctly, it dumps it to the following location:
/etc/<redacted>/<year><month><day>_<count>.dump
Signiﬁcance of Input Files
The conﬁguration ﬁles provide context into the targets of this information gathering and monitoring
campaign. The data in keyword_parm.txt contained terms of geopolitical interest to Chinese
intelligence collection. The two lists phoneMap and imsiMap from parm.txt contained a high
volume of phone numbers and IMSI numbers.
For a quick review, IMSI numbers are used in both GSM (Global System for Mobiles) and UMTS
(Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) mobile phone networks and consists of three
parts:
1. Mobile Country Code (MCC)
2. Mobile Network Code (MNC)
3. Mobile Station Identiﬁcation Number (MSIN)
The Mobile Country Code corresponds to the subscriber’s country, the Mobile Network Code
corresponds to the speciﬁc provider and the Mobile Station Identiﬁcation Number is uniquely tied
to a speciﬁc subscriber.

Figure 2: IMSI number description
The inclusion of both phone and IMSI numbers show the highly targeted nature of this cyber
intrusion. If an SMS message contained either a phone number or an IMSI number that matched
the predeﬁned list, it was saved to a CSV ﬁle for later theft by the threat actor.
Similarly, the keyword list contained items of geopolitical interest for Chinese intelligence
collection. Sanitized examples include the names of political leaders, military and intelligence
organizations and political movements at odds with the Chinese government. If any SMS

messages contained these keywords, MESSAGETAP would save the SMS message to a CSV
ﬁle for later theft by the threat actor.
In addition to MESSAGETAP SMS theft, FireEye Mandiant also identiﬁed the threat actor
interacting with call detail record (CDR) databases to query, save and steal records during this
same intrusion. The CDR records corresponded to foreign high-ranking individuals of interest to
the Chinese intelligence services. Targeting CDR information provides a high-level overview of
phone calls between individuals, including time, duration, and phone numbers. In contrast,
MESSAGETAP captures the contents of speciﬁc text messages.

Looking Ahead
The use of MESSAGETAP and targeting of sensitive text messages and call detail records at
scale is representative of the evolving nature of Chinese cyber espionage campaigns observed
by FireEye. APT41 and multiple other threat groups attributed to Chinese state-sponsored actors
have increased their targeting of upstream data entities since 2017. These organizations, located
multiple layers above end-users, occupy critical information junctures in which data from
multitudes of sources converge into single or concentrated nodes. Strategic access into these
organizations, such as telecommunication providers, enables the Chinese intelligence services an
ability to obtain sensitive data at scale for a wide range of priority intelligence requirements.
In 2019, FireEye observed four telecommunication organizations targeted by APT41 actors.
Further, four additional telecommunications entities were targeted in 2019 by separate threat
groups with suspected Chinese state-sponsored associations. Beyond telecommunication
organizations, other client verticals that possess sensitive records related to speciﬁc individuals of
interest, such as major travel services and healthcare providers, were also targeted by APT41.
This is reﬂective of an evolving Chinese targeting trend focused on both upstream data and
targeted surveillance. For deeper analysis regarding recent Chinese cyber espionage targeting
trends, customers may refer to the FireEye Threat Intelligence Portal. This topic was also briefed
at FireEye Cyber Defense Summit 2019.
FireEye assesses this trend will continue in the future. Accordingly, both users and organizations
must consider the risk of unencrypted data being intercepted several layers upstream in their
cellular communication chain. This is especially critical for highly targeted individuals such as
dissidents, journalists and ofﬁcials that handle highly sensitive information. Appropriate
safeguards such as utilizing a communication program that enforces end-to-end encryption can
mitigate a degree of this risk. Additionally, user education must impart the risks of transmitting
sensitive data over SMS. More broadly, the threat to organizations that operate at critical
information junctures will only increase as the incentives for determined nation-state actors to
obtain data that directly support key geopolitical interests remains.
