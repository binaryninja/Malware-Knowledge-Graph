In our monitoring of the LockBit ransomware’s intrusion set, we found an announcement for
LockBit Linux-ESXi Locker version 1.0 on October 2021 in the underground forum "RAMP,"
where potential affiliates can find it. This signifies the LockBit ransomware group’s efforts to
expand its targets to Linux hosts. Since October, we have been seeing samples of this
variant in the wild.
This variant could have a big impact on victim organizations because of how ESXi, VMware’s
hypervisor helps in managing servers.
Analysis of the variant
Lockbit Linux-ESXi Locker version 1.0 uses a combination of Advanced Encryption Standard
(AES) and elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) algorithms for data encryption. From our
analysis, we can see that this version of LockBit can accept parameters, as detailed in
Figure 1.

This version of the ransomware has logging capabilities and can log the following
information:
Processor information
Volumes in the system
Virtual machines (VMs) for skipping
Total files
Total VMs
Encrypted files
Encrypted VMs
Total encrypted size
Time spent for encryption
This variant also contains commands necessary for encrypting VM images hosted on ESXi
servers, as listed in Table 1.
Command

false

Disable autostart

vim-cmd hostsvc/hostsummary grep cpuModel

Determine ESXi CPU model

The ransom note is typical of LockBit attacks. It advertises the speed of LockBit 2.0, lists
down the leak sites where the LockBit group threatens to publish stolen information, and
ends with a recruitment ad for potential insiders enticing them with “millions of dollars” in
exchange for access to valuable company data.

LockBit's operators typically threaten to publish data they stole from their victims on their leak
site once their targeted organizations have failed to comply with their ransom demands.

Impact of the variant
The release of this variant is in line with how modern ransomware groups have been shifting
their efforts to target and encrypt Linux hosts such as ESXi servers. An ESXi server typically
hosts multiple VMs, which in turn hold important data or services for an organization. The
successful encryption by ransomware of ESXi servers could therefore have a large impact
on targeted companies. This trend was spearheaded by ransomware families like REvil and
DarkSide.
Recommendations
ESXi offers organizations an easier way to manage their servers. But ransomware operators
are also mirroring the transition of organizations to platforms such as ESXi. This
development adds LockBit to the list of ransomware families capable of targeting Linux hosts
in general and the ESXi platform in particular.
While Linux versions are typically harder to detect, implementing security best practices can
still help organizations minimize the possibility of a successful attack. In the case of LockBit,
keeping systems up to date can prevent intrusions. This is because LockBit has been known

to use access credentials stolen from vulnerable servers and sold in the cybercriminal
underground. VMware also provides recommendations for enhancing the security of ESXi.
Organizations should also consider the following steps to mitigate ransomware threats:
Deploy cross-layered detection and response solutions. Find solutions that can
anticipate and respond to ransomware activities, techniques, and movements before
the threat culminates. Trend Micro Vision One™, for example, helps detect and block
ransomware components to stop attacks before they can affect an enterprise.
Create a playbook for attack prevention and recovery. Both an incident response
(IR) playbook and IR frameworks help organizations plan for different attacks.
Conduct attack simulations. Expose employees to realistic cyberattack simulations that
can help decision-makers, security personnel, and IR teams identify and
prepare for potential security gaps and attacks.
