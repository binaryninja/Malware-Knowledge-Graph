Stealthy OpenDocument Malware Deployed Against Latin American
Hotels
In late June 2022, HP Wolf Security isolated an unusually stealthy malware campaign that
used OpenDocument text (.odt) files to distribute malware. OpenDocument is an open,
vendor-neutral file format compatible with several popular office productivity suites, including
Microsoft Office, LibreOffice and Apache OpenOffice. As described in a blog post by Cisco
Talos, the campaign targets the hotel industry in Latin America. The targeted hotels are
contacted by email with fake booking requests. In the case below, the attached document
was purportedly a guest registration document.

Infection chain
The malicious document was sent as an email attachment. If the user opens the document,
they are shown a prompt asking whether fields with references to other files should be
updated. An Excel file opens if they click ‘Yes’ to this cryptic message.

Afterwards, the user is shown another prompt asking whether macros should be enabled or
disabled. If the user allows macros, this triggers the infection chain, eventually leading to the
execution of the malware payload, AsyncRAT.

It’s interesting to see OpenDocument files being used to distribute malware because we
seldom see malware in the wild that uses this file format. Strikingly, the document used in the
campaign is poorly detected by anti-virus scanners, with a 0% detection rate on VirusTotal as
of 7 July.

Unlike many malicious documents, analyzing the OpenDocument file reveals no hidden
macros. However, the document references Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) objects
hosted remotely, as shown in the styles.xml file. The document references 20 documents
hosted on the same domain, webnar[.]info.

When opening the document, these references are downloaded and opened. Based on our
analysis, the same document is always downloaded and contains no macro code. However,
the downloaded document contains ten embedded Excel spreadsheets. If the user chose to
enable macros at the prompt in Figure 3, each of these Excel files opens and asks the user if
macros should be activated. It is unclear what purpose is served by opening so many
duplicate files.

Figure 6 – Externally referenced Word document contains 10 Excel files.
The Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro inside the Excel documents is lean, running a
command using the mshta.exe (T1218.005) tool built into Windows that downloads and
executes additional code from the web.

At this point, a complex chain of PowerShell, VBScript and batch scripts are started, finally
decoding and executing AsyncRAT, an open-source remote access trojan written in C#. A
scheduled task is created to make the malware persistent on the infected PC. The task relaunches the malware every two hours. The significant part of this infection chain is how the
attacker evaded detection by relying on the OpenDocument format to load malware using
external OLE objects.

Links to other campaign activity
To see if the same lure was used in other campaigns, we compared the images in the
malicious document to a corpus of historical malicious document images from the last three
years.

Figure 9 – Campaign using the same lure image.
In July, another malicious document was spotted in the wild that contained the logo of a
legitimate organization mimicked by the threat actor. The main difference between the two
campaigns is that the second one relied on Microsoft Word documents instead of
OpenDocument files. Interestingly, the detection rate of the malicious Microsoft Word
document is far higher than the OpenDocument file.

Both campaigns used the same lure and targeted Latin American hotels by email. We found
evidence of similar activity that has been ongoing for several months based on the targeted
organizations and lure languages (Portuguese and Spanish).

Conclusion
Attackers are always hunting for stealthy ways of delivering malware that evades endpoint
security. This campaign illustrates how OpenDocument text files can be abused to deliver
malware through external OLE references with extremely low detection rates. Documents
that arrive from outside an organization should always be treated with suspicion, especially if
they try to load external content from the web – but in practice this isn’t always
straightforward advice to follow, especially in industries that rely on exchanging electronic

documents between suppliers and clients. However, since HP Wolf Security works by
isolating high-risk tasks like opening email attachments inside secure micro-virtual machines
that does not rely on detection, this stopped the malware in this campaign from infecting the
host system.
