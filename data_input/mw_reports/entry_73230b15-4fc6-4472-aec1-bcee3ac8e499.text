January 24, 2023

FortiGuard Labs has been actively tracking wiper malware targeting Ukrainian organizations
since the start of the 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict. The sudden spike in wiper malware
began early in the year with numerous new wiper samples targeted at Ukraine. It displayed a
side of cyberattacks we rarely see: pure destruction. We published an article last April 2022
to help people understand the context, history, and technical setup of wiper attacks. This
post focuses on what happened the rest of the year and how wiper malware and their attack
scenarios have changed.
Affected Platforms: Multiple
Impacted Users: Large organizations
Impact: Data loss and OS and file corruption
Severity Level: High

Recap
Since that last report, quite a few new samples have been launched. Figure 1 shows an
updated version of a timeline we have used in the past. In April, we were already surprised
by the significant increase in wipers. As you can see, it increased even further over the rest
of the year.

Wipers in the War
Much of the wiper malware seen in the first half of 2022, whether attributed or not, was
deployed against Ukrainian organizations. These include HermeticWiper, CaddyWiper,
IsaacWiper, WhisperGate, and others. When you think about it, the growth in wiper malware
during a conflict is hardly a surprise. It can scarcely be monetized. The only viable use case
is destruction, sabotage, and cyberwar.
One interesting event was the AcidRain wiper malware that targeted the satellite modems of
a global satellite communications provider, which caused modems to lose connections to
their satellite network. The message was clear: even if a cyberattack is used to target
Ukraine, its effects can easily spill over and affect other countries and organizations. It is vital
that we track these new highly malicious attacks.

Motivation: Hacktivism
As the year progressed, pro-Russian hacktivism also increased. We saw that in our
telemetry, showing, for example, an increase in DDOS attacks in Nordic countries, especially
Finland (Figure 2).
Figure 2 - Fortinet combined IPS, malware, and botnet detections in the Nordic countries
However, hacktivism is usually associated with DoS and defacement attacks. But this time,
some actors began repurposing their ransomware as wipers by not providing a decryption
key. And if no decryption is provided, then ransomware essentially acts as a wiper. We saw
actors begin to do this intentionally.
For instance, the Somnia ransomware was deployed at several Ukrainian organizations. The
attackers compromised systems using a fake software installer and established a persistent
presence. Like most ransomware attacks, they exfiltrated data and kept their access as long
as needed. But at the end of the attack, no decryptor was offered, meaning the files
remained encrypted and useless.

The Most Intriguing Wiper of the Year

2/8

The most intriguing wiper we documented in the second half of 2022 was one named ‘Azov.’
Its second version quickly drew media attention because it delivered a message written in
the name of well-known security researchers. These researchers denied any connection to
the malware. It also delivered a pro-Ukrainian message claiming it was using the malware to
draw more attention to the Ukraine-Russia war. However, so far, no attribution has been
made.
However, as it turned out, the message was not the most interesting part of the malware. It is
also very compelling from a technical perspective.
First, it was written in the assembly language and built with the FASM tool. This is unusual
because most new malware is written in languages such as python, .NET or C/C++. It also
contradicts everyone’s first impression that it was a prank used to blame security
researchers. However, it seems unlikely that anybody would go to the effort to write malware
in assembly just for a joke.
It also implements polymorphic code creation to inject itself into legitimate EXE files on the
infected machine. It then executes a backdooring function by injecting a modified version of
itself into EXE files. This provides persistence to the malware because it can run again once
the backdoored files are executed.
It also implements a variety of anti-analysis techniques:
Opaque predicates
Anti-debug
Syntactic bloat and junk code
Using CALL instructions instead of RET or JMP
Dynamically creating the Import Address Table
All this demonstrates that this malware was not created for fun. It is a sophisticated wiper
that implements a variety of modern techniques, clearly showing that a sophisticated threat
actor.

Improving Performance
Ransomware authors understand that encryption speed is often crucial for a successful
operation. Once encryption is started, they are in a race against the incident response team,
who might detect them at any time. As a result, performance optimization was developed.
Some new ransomware now implements a multi-threaded architecture that enables it to run
multiple encryption threads in parallel. Other operators have realized that encrypting files in
their entirety is time-consuming—and may not even be necessary. The BlackCat
ransomware, for instance, implements multiple different encryption strategies with varying
improvements in performance (see this VirusBulletin presentation).

3/8

A similar problem exists for wipers. Traditionally, wipers would erase an entire disk using a
kernel driver, delete files using different techniques, and/or alter the content of files (more on
techniques in our last article). These all take time. As a result, some authors began
experimenting with performance optimization.
The DoubleZero wiper, for instance, only erases the first 4096 bytes of targeted files. This
means that most of the data in an average file would not be erased. However, it’s also true
that restoring these files at scale would be very impractical. For instance, modern Microsoft
.docx files are essentially a collection of compressed XML files. Deleting the first 4096 bytes
from them would corrupt the compression and the generic file structure, meaning these files
would not work anymore. Recreating a functioning file with manual forensic work might be
possible, but it is simply not feasible when dealing with hundreds or thousands of files.
The Azov wiper also implemented a somewhat more optimized wiping process. It does not
remove all data in each file. Instead, it only targets 666 bytes in an alternating pattern (666
bytes overwritten, 666 bytes intact, 666 bytes overwritten, etc.) up to 4 GB.

Targeting OT
OT environments also saw their fair share of wipers. We already mentioned the attack
against the satellite provider (and, by extension, the German windmills). Another interesting
attack using the Industroyer.V2 malware targeted a Ukrainian high-voltage electric
substation. That attack aimed to manipulate the electric relays to take the substation offline.
In the context of OT, I would consider the use of the Industroyer.V2 malware in this context
as a wiper. Traditional IT wipers have the goal of destroying the crown jewels of IT, the data.
Industroyer.V2 was used to destroy the crown jewel of that substation, its operation.
If this was not enough, the Industroyer.V2 malware was deployed along with three other
wipers, potentially from different actors:
CaddyWiper for Windows machines
AWFULSHRED for Linux, Unix machines
SOLOSHRED for Solaris machines
This helps serve as a reminder that OT environments are being actively targeted by different
threat actors, ranging from ransomware operators to state-sponsored APTs.

In Development
An interesting new project to pay attention to is the Endurance wiper. It is an open-source
wiper that seemingly aspires to become ransomware. Figure 3 shows the malware’s features
and readiness state as described by the author.

Currently, Endurance’s file-wiping capabilities offer three wiping modes, with each mode
defining how many times content should be overwritten. It also offers CONTENT deletion and
FILE deletion functions. The CONTENT deletion (Figure 4) function is responsible for
overwriting the contents of a file on disk.
Figure 4 - Loop to overwrite the file's content multiple times
The FILE deletion function (Figure 5) updates all file attributes and then erases the file from
the disk.
Figure 5 - File deletion overwrites all file attributes and removes the file
This tool is actively in development, although at the time of testing, we had to fix the code
build it. Since it is open-source, this could provide an easy entry point for attackers wanting
to join the wiper/ransomware game.

Conclusion
2022 provided us with new perspectives on destructive malware. We saw different wiping
techniques, different motivations, and differentmotivations, actors, and deployment
scenarios. New wiper instances, such as the Azov and Endurance wipers, show that actors
are actively engaged in increasingly malicious activity. They are also trying to address
shorter threat detection and response time by effectively optimizing the performance of their
wiping strategies. And we are also seeing increased attention being paid to OT networks,
such as the example of the Industroyer.V2 malware. The point is clear. The gloves are off as
threat actors increasingly engage in attacks designed with one purpose: to destroy their
targets.
