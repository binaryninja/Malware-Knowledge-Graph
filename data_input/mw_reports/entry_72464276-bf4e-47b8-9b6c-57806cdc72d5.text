EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In recent years, radio frequency (RF) jammers have become increasingly more accessible to the
public. While most RF jamming is benign and simply intended to provide extra privacy, first responder
operations have also been specifically targeted by jamming and interference attacks. RF detection,
spectrum analysis, and direction finding equipment can be used to detect, identify, and locate RF
interference sources that may be disrupting first responder communications systems.
Many RF technologies are available for operational field usage, as opposed to laboratory usage. This
allows for quick deployment, letting responders locate and mitigate radio interference. Some of
these products can be installed as a permanent fixed sensor or can be portable and deployed
temporarily as a fixed sensor. Other products are handheld and mobile, allowing responders to
thoroughly search an area, which may be affected by RF interference.
Some of these products have features such as built-in map and spectrum plot displays to provide
data visualization or internal storage drives that allow data to be recorded for future analysis. These
technologies can detect RF interference sources at frequencies as low as 9 kHz and as high as
18 GHz.
The purpose of this market survey report is to provide emergency responders with information on RF
detection, spectrum analysis, and direction finding equipment that are commercially available in
order to guide purchasing and acquisition decision-making.
In June 2018, NUSTL through its System Assessment and Validation for Emergency Responders
(SAVER) Program, conducted a market survey of RF detection, spectrum analysis, and direction
finding equipment. The survey produced 14 products ranging in price from $15,000 to $270,000.
The results of the market survey are highlighted in this report. Performance of these products has
not been independently verified by NUSTL.
Emergency response agencies that consider purchasing RF detection, spectrum analysis, and
direction finding equipment should carefully research the overall capabilities and limitations and
technical specifications of each system in relation to their agency’s operational needs.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
Radio frequency (RF) detection and spectrum analysis equipment includes devices that can detect,
identify, and analyze RF signals transmitted by various sources. RF direction finding equipment
includes devices that measure and triangulate the direction from which an RF signal was
transmitted. These devices can be used to identify and locate transmissions from suspicious or
threatening sources, including RF interference that may be blocking first responder communications
or damaging electronic devices. NUSTL, through its System Assessment and Validation for
Emergency Responders (SAVER) Program, conducted a market survey to provide emergency
responders with information on RF detection, spectrum analysis, and direction finding equipment.
This market survey report is based on information gathered during June 2018 from vendor websites,
internet research, industry publications and a government-issued Request for Information (RFI) that
was posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website. For inclusion in this report, products had
to meet the following criteria:

• Product must be commercially available
• Product must be designed for usage in the field rather than in a laboratory environment
• Product must be designed to detect RF signals intended to interfere with first responder
communications systems.

Due diligence was performed to develop a report that is representative of products in the
marketplace.

2.0 RF DETECTION, SPECTRUM ANALYSIS, AND DIRECTION FINDING
EQUIPMENT OVERVIEW
In recent years RF jammers have become increasingly more accessible to the public. While most RF
jamming is simply intended to provide extra privacy, first responder operations have also been
specifically targeted by jamming and interference attacks.
Radio interference works by targeting receivers. An RF jammer will transmit a signal on the same
frequency as the desired signal. The jamming signal may be received at the same power level or a
greater power level, thus preventing receivers from being able to distinguish the desired signal from
the jamming signal.
While radio communications may be the most obvious target of RF jammers, these interference
sources can also disrupt the operation of other devices that communicate wirelessly. An example of
this is the usage of a Global Positioning System (GPS) jammer by a truck driver to avoid paying
highway tolls and avoid being tracked by his or her employer. Alternatively, an example of an RF
jammer specifically targeting first responder operations is an interference source preventing a
control center from receiving video uploaded by traffic cameras.

2.1 CURRENT TECHNOLOGIES
The technologies listed in this report range from fixed site sensors with omnidirectional antennas
for spectrum monitoring to mobile handheld sensors with directional antennas for direction
finding. Most of the products in this report can operate as a standalone sensor. However, some
products, especially fixed site sensors, can be networked for greater monitoring coverage. While
some of the technologies include a built-in display, many use an external laptop or tablet, which
provides a spectrum analyzer or a map display locating any detected RF jamming and interference
sources.

2.2 APPLICATIONS
As mentioned above, RF jamming and interference can disrupt first responder communications
during emergency response operations. RF detection devices can be used to identify any RF
interference that might impact communications. Spectrum analysis devices can be used to
determine the frequency and received strength of RF interference. Spectrum analysis devices can
also be used to identify frequencies that are free of interference should a responder use channel
switching as a RF jamming mitigation tactic. RF direction finders can assist in locating RF jamming
devices. If the interference source is located, responders can apply direct mitigation tactics to
overcome the impacts of RF jamming.

3.8 DGS SIGBASE 6000
The DGS SigBASE series can automate the capturing, classifying, direction finding, and alerting of
anomalous RF signals including jammers, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unauthorized land
mobile radio (LMR) devices. The SigBASE is a fixed sensor that can operate as a standalone
sensor or a node in a multi-unit network. A single SigBASE 6000 can support multiple missionspecific antenna configurations and up to four software defined radios.
The SigBASE uses machine learning to compare environmental RF data against a baseline of
learned and/or programmed data (such as channel masks or whitelisted radios) at the point of
intercept, without requiring backhaul of I/Q data for post processing. This capability provides
quicker access to knowledge and real-time RF situational awareness. The “trigger manager”
feature allows users to set triggers and alerts for specific signals of interest. The product can also
be operated in “stealth mode” without requiring network backhaul. Raw I/Q data and fast Fourier
transform (FFT) data can be recorded for future analysis. Data is typically stored on an internal
SSD or can be saved to centralized storage devices.
The detection bandwidth of the SigBASE 6000 ranges from 50 MHz to 6 GHz. The scanning
bandwidth of the receiver ranges from 20 MHz to 80 MHz. Detection range and receiver sensitivity
is dependent on the transmission frequency and antenna configuration of the receiver. Ranges of
up to 50 kilometers are claimed by the vendor. The size of the product, as given by the vendor, is
17 x 15 x 6.85 inches with a weight of 19.4 pounds. The SigBASE costs approximately $51,000
with annual maintenance fees of $6,300.

3.9 DGS SIGBASE 4000
The DGS SigBASE is a mobile version of the SigBASE series. The system is comprised of a
ruggedized laptop that provides wideband RF detection and spectrum analysis from 70 MHz to
6 GHz, primarily for the purposes of interference hunting. Because of its form factor and single
radio, it does not provide direction finding. Like its fixed counterpart, the SigBASE 4000 offers the
same machine learning feature for identification of interference sources, and is also capable of
recording data for future analysis. Unlike the SigBASE 6000, the mobile version includes a built-in
display.
The detection bandwidth of the SigBASE 4000 ranges from 70 MHz to 6 GHz. The scanning
bandwidth ranges from 20 MHz to 40 MHz. The receiver sensitivity is -114 dB with a 1 kHz
bandwidth and a 2.4 GHz center frequency. The size of the product, as given by the vendor is 13.7
x 8.78 x 1.34 inches with a weight of 6.61 pounds. The SigBASE 4000 hardware costs
approximately $16,000. The accompanying software costs approximately $8,000. Annual
maintenance fees for the SigBASE 4000 are $1,600.

5.0 CONCLUSIONS
With the accessibility of RF jammers increasing, first responder operations are becoming more
vulnerable to this threat. RF interference sources may disrupt radio communications and the
operation of sensors and other types of equipment that transmit data wirelessly.
RF detection, spectrum analysis, and direction finding equipment allows responders to detect,
identify, and locate RF jamming and interference sources. Once interference sources are located,
responders can mitigate the threat.
This market survey report provides information on 14 RF detection, spectrum analysis, and direction
finding systems, which can detect signals on frequencies as low as 9 kHz and as high as 18 GHz. The
products described in the market survey report include fixed site sensors, which can be networked
for spectrum monitoring, and mobile handheld sensors with directional antennas for direction
finding. Many of the systems include a display that provides spectrum analysis and location
visualizations. In addition to the configuration of the products, the technologies also differ in price,
detection bandwidth, scanning bandwidth and frequency resolution, detection range, and receiver
sensitivity. The products in this market survey report range in price from $15,000 to $270,000.
Emergency responder agencies that consider purchasing RF detection, spectrum analysis, and
direction finding systems should carefully research each product’s overall capabilities and limitations
in relation to their agency’s operational needs.
