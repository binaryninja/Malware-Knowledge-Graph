Because sometimes you can't teach an old malware developer new
tricks
There’s nothing new in Brazilian cybercriminals trying out new ways to stay under the radar.
It’s just that this time around the bad guys have started using a method that was reported in
the wild years ago.
Russian gangs used this technique to distribute malware capable of modifying the hosts file
on Windows systems. Published by McAfee in 2013, the UTF-8 BOM (Byte Order Mark)
additional bytes helped these malicious crews avoid detection.
Since these campaigns depended on spear phishing to increase the victim count, the
challenge was to fool email scanners and use a seemingly corrupted file that lands in the
victim’s inbox.
The first indicator appears when the user tries to open the ZIP file with the default file
explorer and sees the following error:

The error message suggests the file is corrupt, but when we check its contents we see
something strange in there.

Zip header prefixed by UTF-8 BOM

Instead of having the normal ZIP header starting with the “PK” signature (0x504B), we have
three extra bytes (0xEFBBBF) that represent the Byte Order Mark (BOM) usually found
within UTF-8 text files. Some tools will not recognize this file as being a ZIP archive format,
but will instead recognize it as an UTF-8 text file and fail to extract the malicious payload.
However, utilities such as WinRAR and 7-Zip ignore this data and extract the content
correctly. Once the user extracts the file with any of these utilities they can execute it and
infect the system.

The file is successfully extracted by WinRAR

The malicious executable acts as a loader for the main payload which is embedded in the
resource section.

Encrypted DLL stored in resource section

The content stored inside the resource, encrypted with a XOR-based algorithm, is commonly
seen in different malware samples from Brazil. The decrypted resource is a DLL that will load
and execute the exported function “BICDAT”.

This library will then download a second stage payload which is a password-protected ZIP
file and encrypted with the same function as the embedded payload. After extracting all the
files, the loader will then launch the main executable.

Strings related to Banking RAT malware

The final payload that’s delivered is a variant of a Banking RAT malware, which is currently
widespread in Brazil and Chile.
Kaspersky Lab products can extract and analyze compressed ZIP files containing the Byte
Order Mark without any problem.

Reports

APT trends report Q1 2022
This is our latest summary of advanced persistent threat (APT) activity, focusing on events
that we observed during Q1 2022.

Lazarus Trojanized DeFi app for delivering malware
We recently discovered a Trojanized DeFi application that was compiled in November 2021.
This application contains a legitimate program called DeFi Wallet that saves and manages a
cryptocurrency wallet, but also implants a full-featured backdoor.

MoonBounce: the dark side of UEFI firmware

11/13

At the end of 2021, we inspected UEFI firmware that was tampered with to embed a
malicious code we dub MoonBounce. In this report we describe how the MoonBounce
implant works and how it is connected to APT41.

The BlueNoroff cryptocurrency hunt is still on
It appears that BlueNoroff shifted focus from hitting banks and SWIFT-connected servers to
solely cryptocurrency businesses as the main source of the group’s illegal income.
