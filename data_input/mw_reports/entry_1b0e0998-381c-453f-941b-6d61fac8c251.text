Win32/Spy.Ranbyus shows how it is possible to bypass payment transaction
signing/authentication with smartcard devices and has started to modify java code in one of
the most popular remote banking systems (RBS) in the Ukraine.
I’ve already mentioned the Win32/Spy.Ranbyus family in my previous blog post about
smartcard monitoring in modern banking malware (Smartcard vulnerabilities in modern
banking malware). It displays really interesting functionality because it shows how it is
possible to bypass payment transaction signing/authentication with smartcard devices. We
have been tracking the latest modification to this malware family and the trojan Ranbyus
1/4

has started to modify java code in one of the most popular remote banking systems (RBS)
in the Ukraine, BIFIT’s iBank 2. ESET Virus Radar statistics show that Ukraine is the region
most affected ever by Ranbyus infection.
This banking trojan doesn’t have webinjection functionality and instead implements
a targeted attack on specific banking/payment
software. Win32/Spy.Ranbyus collects
information about the infected system (active
processes, OS version and so on) and
forwards it to its command center. The main functionality for stealing money is based on a
set of various form grabbers for specific payment software. For example, grabbers for
software developed for the java platform look like this:

I’ve already disclosed information about java patching functionality in another banking
malware family, Carberp (Carberp Gang Evolution: CARO 2012 presentation). Carberp has
specific functionality for modifying the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and tracking payment
software activity. And Ranbyus is based on a different method, modifying java code only for
specific application without changing the JVM. For example, Ranbyus can modify the
balance figures so as to hide information about fake transactions implemented through the
malware.

In addition, Win32/Spy.Ranbyus can block RBS software activity and show the following
message in the Russian language:
Translated from the Russian the message
looks like this:
“Technical work is being performed on the
server, and the service may be temporarily
unavailable. We apologize for the
inconvenience”.
Ranbyus targets Ukrainian and Russian banks and is never seen in campaigns targeting
other regions. The command center panel for the Win32/Spy.Ranbyus botnet looks like
this:

The Carberp gang is the (crime) market leader in the Russian region and has already
secured a safe position in the top 20 most active threats in Russia for a full year (Carberp,
the renaissance). Ranbyus has the leading position among banking malware in the
Ukrainian region.
