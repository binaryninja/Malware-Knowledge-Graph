Energy reserves in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea and the “MEDEAST” gas pipeline:
The Mediterranean Sea has become an increasingly relevant geostrategic topic for the
Ministries of Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Greece, Cyprus, Israel and even China due to the
controversies generated during the last decade for the discoveries of natural gas resources
located in the Eastern Mediterranean seas of States such Israel, Cyprus and Egypt ([1]).
The presence of Turkish troops in Libya and Syria, and the Franco-Greek alliance to avoid
Turkish intrusions in the maritime territory of Greece show the relevance and global interest
in energy resources in the area.
As it could be seen in the following map, part of the geostrategic conflict is focused on the
Turkish EEZ. Turkey carried out an agreement with Libya which tries to carry out an
expansion of its exclusive maritime economic zones ([2]).
It is relevant to clarify that an EEZ is a maritime zone prescribed by the United Nations
Convention on the law of the sea over which a state has special rights regarding the
exploration and exploitation of sea resources, including the production of energy through the
water and wind ([3]) ([17]):

Illustration 1. Expansion of Turkish EEZ
The expansion that the Turkish government tries to carry out could increase the geopolitical
risk among Cypriots, Greeks and even Israeli governments. The military presence in the area
by those States could be seen in the map shown above. The strategy of increasing Turkey’s
EEZ would leave without an important part of the continental shelf Athens ([4]). In addition,
Cyprus is significantly affected by this EEZ’s expansion as there is an occupation of the
Cyprus’ EEZ area. Furthermore, the President Erdogan has publicly declared that his oil
exploration projects in the coast of Cyprus will not cease. Turkey tries to stablish a zone of
EEZ controlled by the Turkish influence which would be represented as in the following map
([5]):

Expansion of the Turkish EEZ and location of energy resources
In the previous map, you can see which energy exploration areas are located in Israel,
Cyprus and Egypt. Moreover, these States give diplomatic support to Cyprus and Greece
regarding the expansion’s conflict of the Turkish EEZ.
Furthermore, the 27th of February of 2020, Greece, Cyprus and Israel signed an agreement
to build up a gas pipeline to transport gas to Europe from the Leviathan gas reserves located
in Israel. Moreover, in the near future there is the intention of joining to the pipeline the
extractions from the Cypriot gas reserves, Aphrodite and Calypso ([6]).

Pipeline
Turkey has displaced several warships to the coast of Cyprus in order to carry out gas
exploration projects. The Eastern European gas pipeline reduces the geopolitical power of
Turkey as it tries to exclude Turkey from any participation in it. This “pipeline” has been
called “EastMed” ([6]). However, during March, Turkey will put an offshore drilling vessel in
order to continue with its oil exploration projects in the EEZ waters of Greece, Cyprus and
the EU in order to try to acquire in the future the role of gas supplier for the EU ([8]).
Interests and influence of China in the Mediterranean area:
China, unlike the US diplomatic-military expansionism, has focused its expansionist strategy
on the diplomatic-commercial strategy. For China, one of its geo-strategically key regions,
has been the Port of Piraeus of Greece. The Greek government tendered for the next 35
years the 67% of the Port’s operations to COSCO (China Ocean Shipping Company) for
368.5 million and 350 million of euros to be invested in the Piraeus’ port infrastructure ([9]).
The Port of Piraeus represents a potential gate of all the commercial flow that comes from
the OBOR sea route. In addition, during November of 2019, China and Greece signed up 16
cooperation agreements of different matters, including trade and energy investments ([10]).

On the other hand, Cyprus signed an agreement with a consortium led by China to build up
the first natural gas import terminal in Cyprus. The terminal is designed to convert imported
liquefied gas into a gaseous form to be used in energy plants ([11]). The construction is
being developed by China Petroleum Pipeline Engineering, Metron, Hudong-Zhngua
Shipbuilding and Wilhelmsen Ship Management. Construction is expected to be done in
2022.
Regarding the international security, China investigates Turkey’s relation with the Uighur
community. The Uyghurs are Turkish-speaking people from the interior of Asia and mostly of
them have Muslim religious confession. The Uyghurs live in northwestern China, in the
Uyghur autonomous region of Xinjiang and are considered a threat to the People’s Republic
of China as they are considered largely jihadist terrorists ([12]).
Turkey is the country that has given the most international support to the Uyghur community.
Currently, up to 45,000 Uyghur refugees live in Turkey on a temporary visa or even with a
permanent residence permit ([13]).
Turkey’s foreign affairs policies are misaligned from those of China. The possible obstruction
of the OBOR route to the Port of Piraeus and the collaborative policies with the Uyghur
community in the Xinjiang region of China could damage their diplomatic relations.
Due to the diplomatic confrontations and conflicting interests of the two countries, China
could carry out cyber espionage operations against Turkish organizations and institutions
linked to diplomacy, defense, energy, telecommunications and foreign trade. Its main
objective could be to collect confidential information in order to gain advantages within the
future geostrategic movements of Turkey and the rest of the actors involved in the conflicts
over the energy resources located in the Mediterranean Sea.
Malicious campaign against Turkish organizations:
A malicious campaign allegedly attributed to APT10 against Turkish organizations from
various sectors such as telecommunications and finance has been identified by Adeo in
January of 2020 ([14]). APT10 is a group presumably attributed to the Ministry of State
Security of China ([15]). In addition, it is a group that usually targets organizations from
various sectors such as defense, energy, health, telecommunications, governments, military,
shipping and IT ([16]).
It has been identified that APT10 usually carries out malicious campaigns against
organizations that could damage the China’s State interests into the global market. On the
other hand, it has also been detected that APT10 usually carries out malicious campaigns
against organizations that support foundations which carry out aid projects with ethnic
groups that may be a potential threat against the Chinese national security, as the case of
the Uyghur community.

Moreover, in this campaign has been identified several similarities with the TTP published in
other APT10 reports in 2019 ([14]). In this case, it was identified that this campaign began in
2016 and the initial access was carried out with the exploitation of a public web application.
Summary of the executed Kill Chain ([14]):
• Initial access:
The attackers deployed the following China Chopper4, JspSpy5 webshells to obtain a
foothold on the victim’s network that they used to execute commands to upload files to the
target machines.
• Reconnaissance, execution and theft of credentials:
In the reconnaissance phase, a series of commands were launched to collect information
from users, domains and shared folders. The hostile actor used legitimate tools of the
Windows operating systems for the reconnaissance stage, such as “ipconfig.exe”,
“whoami.exe”, “net.exe”, “ping.exe”, “powershell.exe” and ” BloodHound ”(bloodHound is not
a legitimate binary from Microsoft). The attacker used an advanced tool called “dns.exe” to
list all the machines that were registered in a particular domain.
Regarding the execution, the hostile actor implemented “hTran” backdoor to be able to
exfiltrate information. In previous malicious APT10 campaigns against Turkey, this
executable file was seen with the name “java.exe” on compromised hosts.
Hostile actors loaded a malicious DLL into the memory of a legitimate binary. The final
payload is injected into the legitimate process “svchost.exe”. It was identified that this
payload was a PlugX variant or a CobaltStrike Beacon as a post-exploitation framework.
To carry out the theft of credentials the hostile actor used the following tools:
“QuarksPWdump” and “Mimikatz”.
• Lateral movements
Through the lateral movements they were able to compromise critical servers and gain
access as a domain administrator. The group used NTLM hashes to move laterally. They
used the tools “net.exe”, “wmic.exe”, “psexec.exe”, “smbexec”, and “wmiexec”.
• Persistence
The advanced group established persistence in certain servers that were of their interest and
deployed a remote access Trojans such as “QuasarRAT” and “PlugX”, moreover penetration
or “pentesting” tools such as “Cobalt Strike” and “kerberos”.
• C&C connections

6/10

Hostile actors used two different ways to keep connections with C&C servers. Once the
vulnerability was exploited to establish itself on the public server, the group moved to the
“terminal server”. To establish communications with the other hosts in the internal network,
they installed an SMB beacon on the “terminal server”, using it as a bridge between the
internal network and the C&C server.

Illustration 4. First C&C communication

method
However, the group established a different method for hosts that had direct access or had a
proxy. In this case they used the http protocol to establish the communications with the C&C.

Illustration 5. Second C&C communication

method
In the following chart, there are the TTPs developed by APT10 during this malicious
campaign against the Turkish organizations ([16]) ([14]):

Recommendations:
It is recommendable that the organizations from the defense sector, governments, energy,
telecommunications and finance linked to projects that may affect the interests of China
apply the maximum prevention to this increase of malicious campaigns from APT groups
presumably linked to China.
It is recommended to apply the IOC of the APT identified as a threat by their intelligence
provider LAB52 as soon as possible.
It is recommended to keep the operating systems, services and tools used in the
organization updated with the latest security patches.
It is recommended to establish security policies (GPOs) to control accesses and actions
carried out in those systems and / or services that are exposed to the internet.
Conclusions:
Since the last decade, Turkey has acquired an important influence in the energy geopolitics
of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. The Turkish foreign policies has hindered the China’s
international trade strategies. Furthermore, the diplomatic Turkish support to certain Chinese
ethnic groups that are considerate as a threat against the Chinese national security, could
8/10

provoke that Turkey becomes a target of groups like APT10 which presumably are linked to
the Ministry of State Security of China. APT10 is a group that has a wide range of targets.
The organizations from sectors of interest for the government of China and the organizations
that have some kind of link with the commercial development of the OBOR route could be
susceptible to being targeted by groups such as APT10.
