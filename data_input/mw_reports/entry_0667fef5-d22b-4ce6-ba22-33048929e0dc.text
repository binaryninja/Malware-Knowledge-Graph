Symantec has identiﬁed a previously unknown group called Sowbug that has been
conducting highly targeted cyber attacks against organizations in South America and
Southeast Asia and appears to be heavily focused on foreign policy institutions and
diplomatic targets. Sowbug has been seen mounting classic espionage attacks by stealing
documents from the organizations it inﬁltrates.
Symantec saw the ﬁrst evidence of Sowbug-related activity with the discovery in March 2017
of an entirely new piece of malware called Felismus used against a target in Southeast
Asia. We have subsequently identiﬁed further victims on both sides of the Paciﬁc Ocean.
While the Felismus tool was ﬁrst identiﬁed in March of this year, its association with Sowbug
was unknown until now. Symantec has also been able to connect earlier attack campaigns
with Sowbug, demonstrating that it has been active since at least early-2015 and may have
been operating even earlier.
To date, Sowbug appears to be focused mainly on government entities in South America
and Southeast Asia and has inﬁltrated organizations in Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru,
Brunei and Malaysia. The group is well resourced, capable of inﬁltrating multiple targets

simultaneously and will often operate outside the working hours of targeted organizations in
order to maintain a low proﬁle.

Highly targeted intrusions
Some clues about the motivation and interests of the attackers can be found in their
activities after compromising victims. For example, in a 2015 attack on one South American
foreign ministry, the group appeared to be searching for very speciﬁc information.
The ﬁrst evidence of its intrusion dated from May 6, 2015 but activity appeared to have
begun in earnest on May 12. The attackers appeared to be interested in one division of the
ministry that is responsible for relations with the Asia-Paciﬁc region. They attempted to
extract all Word documents stored on a ﬁle server belonging to this division by bundling
them into a RAR archive by running the following command:
cmd.exe /c c:\windows\rar.exe a -m5 -r -ta20150511000000 -v3072 c:\recycler\
[REDACTED].rar "\\[REDACTED]\*.docx" \\[REDACTED]\*.doc.
Interestingly, the command speciﬁed that only ﬁles modiﬁed from May 11, 2015 onwards
should be archived.
The attackers appear to have successfully extracted the archive because an hour later they
returned, this time attempting to extract all documents modiﬁed from May 7, 2015, an extra
four days’ worth of data. Presumably they either didn't ﬁnd what they were looking for in the
initial incursion, or else noticed something in the documents they stole earlier that prompted
them to hunt for more information.
The attackers didn’t stop there. Their next move was to list any remote shared drives and
then attempt to access remote shares owned by the speciﬁc government ofﬁce they were
targeting, again attempting to extract all Word documents. In this case, they searched for
any documents modiﬁed from May 9 onwards. The attackers then seemed to broaden their
interest, listing the contents of various directories on remote shares, including one belonging
to another division of the South American foreign ministry, this one responsible for relations
with international organizations. They also deployed two unknown payloads to the infected
server. In total, the attackers maintained a presence on the target’s network for four months
between May and September 2015.

Network traversal: Keeping a low proﬁle
Sowbug frequently maintains a long-term presence on the networks of targeted
organizations, sometimes remaining inside a victim environment for up to six months. One
of the tactics it uses to avoid drawing attention to itself is impersonating commonly used
software packages such as Windows or Adobe Reader. It has never attempted to
compromise the software itself. Rather, it gives its tools ﬁle names similar to those used by
the software and places them in directory trees that could be mistaken for those used by the
legitimate software. This allows the attackers to hide in plain sight, as their appearance in
process listings is unlikely to arouse suspicion.

For example, in September 2016, Sowbug inﬁltrated an organization in Asia, deploying the
Felismus backdoor on one of its computers, Computer A, using the ﬁle name adobecms.exe
in CSIDL_WINDOWS\debug. From there, it installed additional components and tools to a
directory named CSIDL_APPDATA\microsoft\security.
The attackers then began to perform reconnaissance activities on Computer A via cmd.exe,
collecting system-related information, such as the OS version, hardware conﬁguration, and
network information. They then performed some further reconnaissance, attempting to
identify all installed applications on the computer. They returned four days later, creating a
sub-directory called “common” in the Adobe directory of the Program Files folder, i.e.
c:\Program Files\Adobe\common, and installed another tool in this sub-directory, again
named adobecms.exe. This was possibly an updated version of the backdoor.
The attackers’ network reconnaissance appeared to be successful because a second
computer of interest in the organization was identiﬁed and compromised. The attackers then
returned to Computer A, installing another executable called fb.exe. This ﬁle appears to be
used to copy Felismus across the network to other computers and there is evidence that the
attackers used it to attempt to infect at least two more computers.
The attackers took further measures to remain under the radar by carrying out their
operations outside of standard ofﬁce hours. In this case, the attackers maintained a
presence on the target’s network for nearly six months between September 2016 and March
2017.

Infection vectors
How Sowbug performs its initial inﬁltration of a target’s network remains unknown. In some
cases, there was no trace of how Felismus made its way onto compromised computers,
meaning it was likely deployed from other compromised computers on the network. In other
attacks, there was evidence that Felismus was installed using a tool known as Starloader
(detected by Symantec as Trojan.Starloader). This is a loader that installs and decrypts data
from a ﬁle called Stars.jpg. Additionally, Starloader was also observed deploying additional
tools used by the attackers, such as credential dumpers and keyloggers.
It is still unknown how Starloader is installed on the compromised computer. One possibility
is that the attackers use fake software updates to install ﬁles. Symantec has found evidence
of Starloader ﬁles being named AdobeUpdate.exe, AcrobatUpdate.exe, and
INTELUPDATE.EXE among others. These were used to create versions of the Felismus
backdoor as well as other tools.

Global threat
While cyber espionage attacks are often seen against targets in the U.S., Europe, and Asia,

it is much less common to see South American countries targeted. However, the number of
active cyber espionage operations has increased steadily in recent years and the
emergence of Sowbug is a reminder that no region is immune to this kind of threat.
