Increase in PYSA Ransomware Targeting
Education Institutions
Summary
FBI reporting has indicated a recent increase in PYSA ransomware
targeting education institutions in 12 US states and the United
Kingdom. PYSA, also known as Mespinoza, is a malware capable of
exfiltrating data and encrypting users’ critical files and data stored on
their systems. The unidentified cyber actors have specifically targeted
higher education, K-12 schools, and seminaries. These actors use PYSA
to exfiltrate data from victims prior to encrypting victim’s systems to
use as leverage in eliciting ransom payments.

Technical Details
Since March 2020, the FBI has become aware of PYSA ransomware attacks against US and foreign
government entities, educational institutions, private companies, and the healthcare sector by
unidentified cyber actors. PYSA typically gains unauthorized access to victim networks by
compromising Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) credentials and/or through phishing emails. The
cyber actors use Advanced Port Scanner and Advanced IP Scanner1 to conduct network
reconnaissance, and proceed to install open source tools, such as PowerShell Empire2, Koadic3, and
Mimikatz4. The cyber actors execute commands to deactivate antivirus capabilities on the victim
network prior to deploying the ransomware.
The cyber actors then exfiltrate files from the victim’s network, sometimes using the free opensource tool WinSCP5, and proceed to encrypt all connected Windows and/or Linux devices and data,
rendering critical files, databases, virtual machines, backups, and applications inaccessible to users.
In previous incidents, cyber actors exfiltrated employment records that contained personally
identifiable information (PII), payroll tax information, and other data that could be used to extort
victims to pay a ransom.
Upon malware execution, a detailed ransom message is generated and displayed on the victim’s
login or lock screen. The ransom message contains information on how to contact the actors via
email, displays frequently asked questions (FAQs), and offers to decrypt the affected files. If the
ransom is not met, the actors warn that the information will be uploaded and monetized on the
darknet. Additionally, the malware is dropped in a user folder, such as
C:\Users\%username%\Downloads\. Observed instances of the malware showed a filename of
svchost.exe, which is most likely an effort by the cyber actors to trick victims and disguise the

They cyber actors used the Advanced Port Scanner and Advanced IP Scanner by FAMATECH, which is an open source tool that
allows users to find open network computers and discover the versions of programs on those ports.

PowerShell Empire is a post exploitation toolkit that provides the ability to run PowerShell agents without needing
powershell.exe, as well as provide modules ranging from keyloggers to Mimikatz, and adaptable communication to avoid network
detection.

Koadic is an open source penetration toolkit that has several options for staging payloads and creating implants.

Mimikatz is an open source post exploitation toolkit that pulls passwords from memory, as well as hashes, and other
authentication credentials.
5
WinSCP is an open source tool that provides secure file transfer between local and remote computer systems.

ransomware as the generic Windows host process name. In some instances, the actors removed the
malicious files after deployment, resulting in victims not finding any malicious files on their systems.
The cyber actors have uploaded stolen data to MEGA.NZ, a cloud storage and file sharing service, by
uploading the data through the MEGA website or by installing the MEGA client application directly
on a victim’s computer. However, in the past actors have used other methods of exfiltrating data
that leaves less evidence of what was stolen.

Information Requested:
The FBI does not encourage paying ransoms. Payment does not guarantee files will be recovered. It
may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors
to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. However, the FBI
understands that when victims are faced with an inability to function, all options are evaluated to
protect shareholders, employees and customers. Regardless of whether your organization decided

TLP:WHITE

TLP:WHITE

to pay the ransom, the FBI urges you to report ransomware incidents to your local FBI field office or
the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) (https://ic3.gov). Doing so provides the FBI with
critical information needed to prevent future attacks by identifying and tracking ransomware
attackers and holding them accountable under U.S. law.

Recommended Mitigations
 Regularly back up data, air gap, and password protect backup copies offline. Ensure copies of
critical data are not accessible for modification or deletion from the system where the data
resides.
 Implement network segmentation.
 Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary
data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, secure location (i.e., hard drive, storage
device, the cloud).
 Install updates/patch operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as they are
released.
 Use multifactor authentication where possible.
 Regularly, change passwords to network systems and accounts, and avoid reusing passwords
for different accounts. Implement the shortest acceptable timeframe for password changes.
 Disable unused remote access/RDP ports and monitor remote access/RDP logs.
 Audit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls with least
privilege in mind.
 Install and regularly update anti-virus and anti-malware software on all hosts.
 Only use secure networks and avoid using public Wi-Fi networks. Consider installing and using
a VPN.
 Consider adding an email banner to messages coming from outside your organizations.
 Disable hyperlinks in received emails.
 Focus on awareness and training. Provide users with training on information security
principles and techniques as well as overall emerging cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities
(i.e., ransomware and phishing scams).
