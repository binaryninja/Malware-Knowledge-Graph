In our announcement on Dec. 8, we stated we would provide updates as we discovered
additional information, in order to ensure that the broader community is aware of the evolving
threats we all face. As part of that commitment, we want to provide you with the following
update on our investigation.
We have identified a global campaign that introduces a compromise into the networks of
public and private organizations through the software supply chain. This compromise is
delivered through updates to a widely-used IT infrastructure management software—the
Orion network monitoring product from SolarWinds. The campaign demonstrates top-tier
operational tradecraft and resourcing consistent with state-sponsored threat actors.
Based on our analysis, the attacks that we believe have been conducted as part of this
campaign share certain common elements:
1/3

Use of malicious SolarWinds update: Inserting malicious code into legitimate
software updates for the Orion software that allow an attacker remote access into the
victim’s environment
Light malware footprint: Using limited malware to accomplish the mission while
avoiding detection
Prioritization of stealth: Going to significant lengths to observe and blend into normal
network activity
High OPSEC: Patiently conducting reconnaissance, consistently covering their tracks,
and using difficult-to-attribute tools
Based on our analysis, we have now identified multiple organizations where we see
indications of compromise dating back to the Spring of 2020, and we are in the process of
notifying those organizations. Our analysis indicates that these compromises are not selfpropagating; each of the attacks require meticulous planning and manual interaction. Our
ongoing investigation uncovered this campaign, and we are sharing this information
consistent with our standard practice.
We have been in close coordination with SolarWinds, the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
and other key partners. We believe it is critical to notify all our customers and the security
community about this threat so organizations can take appropriate steps. As this activity is
the subject of an ongoing FBI investigation, there are also limits to the information we are
able to share at this time.
We have already updated our products to detect the known altered SolarWinds binaries. We
are also scanning for any traces of activity by this actor and reaching out to both customers
and non-customers if we see potential indicators.

FireEye’s mission is to make our customers and the broader community safer. We are
methodically uncovering and exposing this campaign piece by piece and working to prevent
future attacks. It will require coordinated action by public and private organizations to fully
expose and mitigate this threat, and we intend to continue our efforts.
