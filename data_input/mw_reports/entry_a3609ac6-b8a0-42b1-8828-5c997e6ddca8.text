Executive Summary
Ukraine CERT (CERT-UA) has released new details on UAC-0026, which SentinelLabs
confirms is associated with the suspected Chinese threat actor known as Scarab.
The malicious activity represents one of the first public examples of a Chinese threat
actor targeting Ukraine since the invasion began.
Scarab has conducted a number of campaigns over the years, making use of a custom
backdoor originally known as Scieron, which may be the predecessor to HeaderTip.
While technical specifics vary between campaigns, the actor generally makes use of
phishing emails containing lure documents relevant to the target, ultimately leading to
the deployment of HeaderTip.

UAC-0026
On March 22nd 2022, CERT-UA published alert #4244, where they shared a quick summary
and indicators associated with a recent intrusion attempt from an actor they dubbed UAC0026. In the alert, CERT-UA noted the delivery of a RAR file archive "Про збереження
відеоматеріалів з фіксацією злочинних дій армії російської федерації.rar" ,
which translates to “On the preservation of video recordings of criminal actions of the army of
the Russian Federation.rar”. Additionally, they note the archive contains an executable file,

which opens a lure document, and drops the DLL file "officecleaner.dat" and a batch
file "officecleaner" . CERT-UA has named the malicious DLL ‘HeaderTip’ and notes
similar activity was recorded in September 2020.
The UAC-0026 activity is the first public example of a Chinese threat actor targeting Ukraine
since the invasion began. While there has been a marked increase in publicly reported
attacks against Ukraine over the last week or so, these and all prior attacks have otherwise
originated from Russian-backed threat actors.

Rough timeline of recent Ukrainian conflict cyber activity

Connection of HeaderTip to Scarab APT
Scarab has a relatively long history of activity based on open source intelligence. The group
was first identified in 2015, while the associated IOCs are archived on OTX. As noted in the
previous research, Scarab has operated since at least 2012, targeting a small number of
individuals across the world, including Russia, United States, and others. The backdoor
deployed by Scarab in their campaigns is most commonly known as Scieron.
During our review of the infrastructure and HeaderTip malware samples shared by CERTUA, we identified relations between UAC-0026 and Scarab APT.
We assess with high confidence the recent CERT-UA activity attributed to UAC-0026 is the
Scarab APT group. An initial link can be made through the design of the malware samples
and their associated loaders from at least 2020. Further relationships can be identified
through the reuse of actor-unique infrastructure between the malware families associated
with the groups:

2/6

As noted in the 2015 reporting on Scarab, there are various indications the threat actor is
Chinese speaking. Based on known targets since 2020, including those against Ukraine in
March 2022, in addition to specific language use, we assess with moderate confidence that
Scarab is Chinese speaking and operating under geopolitical intelligence collection
purposes.

Lure Documents
Analysis of lure documents used for initial compromise can provide insight into those being
targeted and particular characteristics of their creator. For instance, in a September 2020
campaign targeting suspected Philippines individuals, Scarab made use of lure documents
titled “OSCE-wide Counter-Terrorism Conference 2020”. For context, OSCE is the
Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.

September 2020 Scarab APT Lure Document Content
More recently, industry colleagues have noted a case in which Scarab was involved in a
campaign targeting European diplomatic organizations during the US withdrawal from
Afghanistan.
The lure document reported by CERT-UA mimics the National Police of Ukraine, themed
around the need to preserve video materials of crimes conducted by the Russian military.

Ukraine Targeting Lure Document
Lure documents through the various campaigns contain metadata indicating the original
creator is using the Windows operating system in a Chinese language setting. This includes
the system’s username set as “用户” (user).

Malware and Infrastructure
Multiple methods have been in use to attempt to load the malware onto the target system. In
the case of the 2020 documents, the user must enable document Macros. In the most recent
version from CERT-UA, the executable loader controls the install with the help of a batch file
while also opening the lure document. The loader executable itself contains the PDF, batch
installer, and HeaderTip malware as resource data.
The batch file follows a simple set of instructions to define the HeaderTip DLL, set
persistence under HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run , and then
execute HeaderTip. Exports called across the HeaderTip samples have been HttpsInit
and OAService , as shown here.

officecleaner.bat File Contents

The HeaderTip samples are 32-bit DLL files, written in C++, and roughly 9.7 KB. The
malware itself will make HTTP POST requests to the defined C2 server using the user agent:
"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko" .
General functionality of HeaderTip is rather limited to beaconing outbound for updates,
potentially so it can act as a simple first stage malware waiting for a second stage with more
capabilities.
Scarab has repeatedly made use of dynamic DNS services, which means C2 server IP, and
subdomains should not be considered related. In fact, some of the dynamic DNS services
used by Scarab can easily link one to various unrelated APT groups, such as the infamous
CloudHopper report or 2015 bookworm malware blogs. While those may be associated with
Chinese APTs, it may indicate more of a standard operating toolkit and approach rather than
shared technical resources.

Conclusion
We assess with high confidence the recent CERT-UA activity attributed to UAC-0026 is the
Scarab APT group and represents the first publicly-reported attack on Ukraine from a nonRussian APT. The HeaderTip malware and associated phishing campaign utilizing Macroenabled documents appears to be a first-stage infection attempt. At this point in time, the
threat actor’s further objectives and motivations remain unclear.
