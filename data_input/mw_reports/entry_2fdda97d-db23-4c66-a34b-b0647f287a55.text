1/10

In this blogpost, we will sum up the findings published in full in our white paper “Okrum and
Ketrican: An overview of recent Ke3chang group activity”.
The Ke3chang group, also known as APT15, is a threat group believed to be operating out
of China. Its activities were traced back to 2010 in FireEye’s 2013 report on operation
Ke3chang – a cyberespionage campaign directed at diplomatic organizations in Europe.
We have been tracking the malicious activities related to this threat actor and discovered
a previously undocumented malware family with strong links to the Ke3chang group – a
backdoor we named Okrum. According to ESET telemetry, Okrum was first detected in
December 2016, and targeted diplomatic missions in Slovakia, Belgium, Chile, Guatemala
and Brazil throughout 2017.
Furthermore, from 2015 to 2019, we detected new versions of known malware families
attributed to the Ke3chang group – BS2005 backdoors from operation Ke3chang and the
RoyalDNS malware, reported by NCC Group in 2018.
Note: New versions of operation Ke3chang malware from 2015-2019 are detected by ESET
systems as Win32/Ketrican and collectively referred to as Ketrican backdoors/samples,
marked with the relevant year, across our white paper and this blogpost.

Investigation timeline
2015: Ketrican
In 2015, we identified new suspicious activities in European countries. The group behind
the attacks seemed to have a particular interest in Slovakia, where a big portion of the
discovered malware samples was detected; Croatia, the Czech Republic and other
countries were also affected.
Our technical analysis of the malware used in these attacks showed close ties to BS2005
backdoors from operation Ke3chang, and to a related TidePool malware family discovered
by Palo Alto Networks in 2016 that targeted Indian embassies across the globe.

2016-2017: Okrum
2/10

The story continued in late 2016, when we discovered a new, previously unknown backdoor
that we named Okrum. The malicious actors behind the Okrum malware were focused on
the same targets in Slovakia that were previously targeted by Ketrican 2015 backdoors.

2017: Ketrican and RoyalDNS
We started connecting the dots when we discovered that the Okrum backdoor was used to
drop a Ketrican backdoor, freshly compiled in 2017.
In 2017, the same entities that were affected by the Okrum malware (and by the 2015
Ketrican backdoors) again became targets of the malicious actors. This time, the attackers
used new versions of the RoyalDNS malware and a Ketrican 2017 backdoor.

2018: Ketrican
In 2018, we discovered a new version of the Ketrican backdoor that featured some code
improvements.

2019: Ketrican
The group continues to be active in 2019 – in March 2019, we detected a new Ketrican
sample that has evolved from the 2018 Ketrican backdoor. It attacked the same targets as
the backdoor from 2018.
This timeline of events shows that the attackers were focused on the same type of targets
but were using different malicious toolsets to compromise them. In the process, they
exposed Okrum, a formerly unknown project. Figure 1 shows ESET detections related to
our investigation in the context of previously documented Ke3chang activity.

Links to Ke3chang group
Our research has shown that the Ketrican, Okrum, and RoyalDNS backdoors detected by
ESET after 2015 are linked to previously documented Ke3chang group activity, and to each
other, in a number of ways. These are the most important connections:
Ketrican backdoors from 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2019 have all evolved from malware
used in Operation Ke3chang
The RoyalDNS backdoor detected by ESET in 2017 is similar to the RoyalDNS
backdoor used in previously reported attacks
Okrum is linked to Ketrican backdoors in that it was used to drop a Ketrican backdoor
compiled in 2017
Okrum, Ketrican and RoyalDNS target the same type of organizations; some of the
entities affected by Okrum were also targeted with one or more of Ketrican/RoyalDNS
backdoors
Okrum has a similar modus operandi as previously documented Ke3chang malware –
it is equipped with a basic set of backdoor commands and relies on manually typing
shell commands and executing external tools for most of its malicious activity

Okrum
Distribution and targets
According to our telemetry, Okrum was used to target diplomatic missions in Slovakia,
Belgium, Chile, Guatemala, and Brazil, with the attackers showing a particular interest in
Slovakia.
The operators of the malware tried to hide malicious traffic with its C&C server within
regular network traffic by registering seemingly legitimate domain names. For example, the
samples used against Slovak targets communicated with a domain name mimicking a
Slovak map portal (support.slovakmaps[.]com). A similar masquerade was used in a
sample detected in a Spanish speaking country in South America – the operators used a
domain name that translates as “missions support” in Spanish
(misiones.soportesisco[.]com).
How the Okrum malware was distributed to the targeted machines is a question that
remains to be answered.

Technical details

4/10

The Okrum backdoor is a dynamic-link library that is installed and loaded by two earlierstage components. During our investigation, the implementation of these two components
was being changed frequently. Every few months, the authors actively changed
implementation of the Okrum loader and installer components to avoid detection. By the
time of publication, ESET systems have detected seven different versions of the loader
component and two versions of the installer, although the functionality remained the same.
The payload of Okrum is hidden in a PNG file. When the file is viewed in an image viewer, a
familiar image is displayed, as seen in Figure 2, but the Okrum loaders are able to locate an
extra encrypted file that the user cannot see. This steganography technique is an attempt
by the malicious actors to stay unnoticed and evade detection.

As for functionality, Okrum is only equipped with basic backdoor commands, such as
downloading and uploading files, executing files and shell commands. Most of the malicious
activity has to be performed by typing shell commands manually, or by executing other tools
and software. This is a common practice of the Ke3chang group, which had also been
pointed out previously in the Intezer and NCC Group reports monitoring Ke3chang group
activity.
Indeed, we have detected various external tools being abused by Okrum, such as a
keylogger, tools for dumping passwords, or enumerating network sessions. The Ketrican
backdoors we detected from 2015 to 2019 used similar utilities. We can only guess why the
Ke3chang actor uses this technique – maybe the combination of a simple backdoor and
external tools fully accommodates their needs, while being easier to develop; but it may
also be an attempt to evade behavioral detection.
The detection evasion techniques we observed in the Okrum malware include embedding
the malicious payload within a legitimate PNG image, employing several anti-emulation and
anti-sandbox tricks, as well as making frequent changes in implementation.

Conclusion

5/10

Our analysis of the links between previously documented Ke3chang malware and the newly
discovered Okrum backdoor lets us claim with high confidence that Okrum is operated by
the Ke3chang group. Having documented Ke3chang group activity from 2015 to 2019, we
conclude that the group continues to be active and works on improving its code over time.

activity”.
