Fantom ransomware impersonates Windows update

Windows 10 has been notorious about automatically installing updates on users’ machines
and now there is a ransomware that aims to capitalize on it. The new ransomware, Fantom,
is based on the EDA2 open-source ransomware project on GitHub called hidden tear that’s
recently been abandoned.

Fantom behind the scenes
In an attempt to conceal malicious intention, the authors of this ransomware modified the file
properties to show copyright and legal trademarks mimicking a Windows update.
Once this dropper is executed, the payload “WindowsUpdate.exe” is dropped in
AppData\Local\Temp displaying the fake Windows Update screen as shown below. This
screen locks you out of doing anything else on your computer, keeping in line with the scam
that Windows 10 doing its normal interrupt of updates.
The percentage counter does work and will go up at about a percent per minute. However,
it’s fake and doesn’t represent anything other than to communicate to you that this “Windows
update” will take a while and that you shouldn’t be alarmed of CPU usage and hard drive
activity. You can close this fake update overlay by ending the process “WindowsUpdate.exe”
using task manager, but the encryption of your files is unaffected.

DECRYPT_YOUR_FILES.HTML ransom note
Encryption is done using AES-128 encryption and when a file is encrypted it will append
“.fantom” to the extension of the file. Also in every directory that a file is encrypted, a
standard ransom note “DECRYPT_YOUR_FILES.HTML” is created.
The ransom note doesn’t have an onion link as your payment portal for your files – a
standard for most encrypting ransomware. Instead, you’re asked to email the cyber criminals
and await response. This tactic is meant to target less savvy computer users who would be
intimidated by creating a bitcoin wallet address and using a tor browser to connect to the
2/5

darknet for ransom payment. To increase odds of
gaining trust, two “freebie” files for decryption are
allowed.
However, it’s clear that these cyber criminals have a
very loose grip on the English language so we don’t
anticipate much traction with their scams through
email. We also reached out as a test and have yet to
hear back in over 24 hours.

Employ a backup solution
Webroot will catch this specific variant in real time before any encryption takes place. We’re
always on the lookout for new threats, but just in case of new zero-day variants, remember
that with encrypting ransomware, the best protection is going to be a good backup solution.
This can be either through the cloud or offline external storage. Keeping it up to date is key
so as not to lose productivity. Webroot has backup features built into our consumer product
that allow you to have directories constantly synced to the cloud. If you were to get infected
by a zero-day variant of encrypting ransomware, you can just restore your files back as we
save a snapshot history for each of your files up to ten previous copies. Please see our
community post on best practices for securing your environment against encrypting
ransomware.
