Letter from the team leaders
Welcome to the CTI League's first darknet activity report.
COVID has changed the very fabric of our society: from how we live to how we work. For many people
worldwide, the new normal of 2021 includes working from home, schooling from home, and
telemedicine. Doctors work to manage patients and a pandemic simultaneously.
The effects of COVID have been felt everywhere, including the cyber threat landscape. Criminals did not
hesitate or waste time when it came to taking advantage of the pandemic. While the world was focused
on health outcomes, threat actors exploited the new conditions. While some criminal promised not to
capitalize on COVID, they did so anyway.
Criminals increased their targeting of healthcare organizations, including hospitals at the front lines of
care delivery. Governments and critical infrastructure were not spared either, as attacks on those
segments spiked in the early days of the pandemic.
Promises of treatments, testing, and critical medical supplies filled the internet, acting as a front for
malware distribution and data collection. Additionally, evidence of ‘Disinformation as a Service’ (DaaS)
and critical elements of disinformation itself also appeared at an escalated rate. As members of our
societies grew increasingly concerned, adversaries grew bolder.
The CTIL Dark team within the CTI League has spent countless hours volunteering their time to assist
law enforcement, administrators, business leaders, and the general public. Their dedication to helping
protect these entities and individuals against emerging threats, cannot be understated. We are eternally
grateful for their support. CTIL Dark’s efforts have not gone unnoticed, so the CTI League saw it fit to
publish this report to showcase a few of their many success stories.
This report serves as a breakdown of some of the CTIL Dark’s findings to what the criminal element was
doing during the first half of the year. We're proud to present their efforts to the public and encourage
you to reach out should you have any questions or comments.

Executive Summary
The healthcare sector faces many threats, including those from supply chain shortages, spikes of severe
illness, and adversaries willing to do harm. While this report focuses on only one of these, we expect it
will be read in context of these other risks and acknowledging the superhuman efforts of so many in
healthcare during this impossible time.
The CTI League aims to create a safer cyberspace for the healthcare industry worldwide from cyberattacks by supplying reliable information, reducing the risk of compromise, supporting security
departments, and neutralizing cyber threats. Within the CTI League there is an entire team of security
researchers and law enforcement personnel who monitor various cybercriminal underground networks
within the Darknet and Deep/Dark web. We have termed ‘CTIL Dark’. Their days are spent looking for
signs of data breaches, targeted attacks, and any other cybercriminal activity that may impact the
medical industry or general public health. CTIL Dark focuses on three different aspects of threats:
•

Threats on the healthcare industry - CTIL Dark focuses on discovering emerging threats to
healthcare organizations. CTIL Dark provides an overview of the risks that can affect these
organization's networks and disrupt their ability to save lives. Data breaches, network access, and
compromised assets offered for sale in the darknet are examples of these threats.

•

Threat actors operating in the darknet – CTIL Dark provides actionable threat intelligence to our law
enforcement partners on the specific threat actor Personas of Interest (POI) who are targeting the
healthcare industry.

•

Threats to Public Health and Safety – CTIL Dark is focused on finding cyber threats to public health
and safety, such as purchasing fake COVID vaccines, which can result in a fatal infection or even
death. The CTI League escalates the threats discovered to inform our associates and law
enforcement partners for the next steps.

The report will be the first in a series exposing what CTIL Dark has discovered and how it has responded.
From participating in operations in concert with law enforcement to collecting evidence on COVID cure
scams to a HUMINT (human intelligence) operation that prevented threat actors from gaining access to
a European hospital chain in less than 8 hours. CTIL Dark’s efforts have not gone unnoticed. The CTI
League recognizes there is value in greater understanding and awareness among the public and is
revealing some of the behind-the-scenes activities that keep them safe from adversaries, whether
criminal, ideological, or state-sponsored. Readers of this report will:

Key Insights
•

CTIL Dark found that the top five ransomware variants that impacted healthcare in 2020 are Maze,
Conti, Netwalker, REvil, and Ryuk, affecting over 100 organizations.

•

CTIL Dark found that nearly two-thirds of healthcare cybercrime victims were in North America and
Europe, with victims in every populated continent.

•

CTIL Dark found that threat actors moved to target the healthcare industry with ransomware
because of their increased prominence during the pandemic and their high susceptibility.

•

CTIL Dark found that demand for backdoor access to healthcare networks increased significantly
from prior years, as did the number of criminals acquiring and selling that access.

•

CTIL Dark found that the proliferation of dark markets and supply chains significantly lowered the
barrier to entry for cybercriminals to affect healthcare.

Key Assessments
•

CTIL Dark assesses that the threat actors that deploy ransomware as part of their attack method will
almost certainly increasingly target the healthcare industry as they have emerged as most
vulnerable during the pandemic.

•

CTIL Dark assesses that as global work-from-home numbers continue to rise, threat actors will
increasingly exploit vulnerable remote access platforms as organizations implement them to
support work from home.

•

CTIL Dark assesses that threat groups will continue to leverage underground message boards and
other Chan forums as a way to test out different COVID-themed conspiracies before launching their
surface web disinformation campaigns.

•

CTIL Dark assesses that phishing from targeted and opportunistic threat actors and from scammers
will adapt to emerging COVID-themed trends to exploit target fear and curiosity.

•

CTIL Dark assesses that threat actors will continue to leak, trade, and sell databases containing
Protected Health Information (PHI) obtained through targeted breaches.

Threats
Since the initial standup CTIL Dark has seen and mapped many trends and threats related to our mission
of stopping threat actors from taking advantage of the healthcare system in a world stretched thin by
COVID. We have found that there are a number of different types of threats exploiting the COVID
pandemic. Some of these threats include opportunistic cybercriminals, scammers, Nation-state
disinformation campaigns, initial access brokers, targeted ransomware, phishing, and the hybrid/other
threats.
Opportunistic cybercriminals within darknet marketplaces have mirrored the pandemic from the
very start. When there was a shortage of masks and COVID test kits, darknet vendors started selling
them. When the United States president embraced Hydroxychloroquine as a way to treat COVID, the
darknet vendors who once sold cocaine and other illicit drugs shifted to selling the anti-malaria
medicine. The United States passed the COVID Relief Bill and immediately following there was an
increase in tax identity theft for stimulus relief fraud.
Disinformation campaigns organized by Nation-state threat actors and Conspiracy-based groups
have been observed on darknet Chan forums and other underground message platforms before
dissemination via automated scripted bot programs and fake medical personnel personas on social
media.
Initial Access Brokers (IABs) seek out vulnerable networks, and once they have access, they then
resell that information to the highest bidder. In many cases these IABs will sell victim access to
ransomware groups through cybercriminal forums. In other cases, the IABs become ransomware
operators themselves by joining a Ransomware-as-a-Service affiliate program.
Ransomware and the groups that deploy them have become one of most sophisticated and wellfunded and fastest-growing cybersecurity threats. As the ‘2020 year of ransomware’ continues, the
attacks are only getting more extensive, targeted and more coordinated. Using malware to infiltrate a
victim's network to encrypt their data and restrict access until payment is made (often through the form
of cryptocurrency), the cybercriminals will often then decrypt the victim's systems and show proof that
they have deleted the victim's data.

Scammers are individuals or small groups with short term goals of cheating the enduser out of money or information. CTIL Dark has interacted with scammers whose entire
purpose was to sell a COVID cure that they didn’t have to unsuspecting people in fear of the
pandemic and the third-order effects that came with it.

Ransomware
CTIL Dark found that perimeter vulnerabilities were the most common entry point in the healthcarerelated Ransomware cases we examined. Adversaries leveraged unpatched vulnerabilities and weak,
reused, or default passwords in remote connectivity systems, such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
servers, to gain access to these servers and pivot farther into victim networks. This finding is surprising,
as prevailing wisdom holds that most Ransomware stems from phishing or social engineering attacks.
One reason for this may be that many organizations deployed remote connectivity hastily because of
time-sensitive work from home mandates.
Part of the CTIL Dark capabilities involves tracking ransomware groups and instantaneous alerting if
they pose a threat to the healthcare industry overall. Early on in the COVID pandemic, the CTIL Dark
team collectors saw signs that multiple RaaS (ransomware as a service) groups would respect the
healthcare groups' need to preserve operations during a global pandemic. The truce limited the threats
and risks to hospitals and possibly showed some collaboration among these groups.

Figure 1 - Maze announces they will not target medical organizations during the pandemic

The truth is that there is no honor among thieves, and as soon as the truce was broken by one, they all
began to plunder any targets they could. The top five ransomware variants that have impacted the
healthcare industry the most in the year 2020 are Maze, Conti, Netwalker, Revil and Ryuk, making up
approximately 75% of all successful attacks tracked. From October to December the CTI League
observed a dramatic uptick in focused attacks against healthcare entities, particularly small and medium
sized hospitals and clinics, which impacted clinical workflows at hundreds of healthcare providers.

Why the CTI League Prioritizes Ransomware
In 2020, the incidence of cyber attacks against healthcare organizations increased dramatically, and
we believe that this trend will continue or accelerate. Unlike the majority of cyber attacks,
Ransomware impairs an organization’s ability to operate normally and can be destructive.
Cybersecurity issues that delay, degrade, or deny access to patient care can be deadly. Although no
deaths have been conclusively linked solely to Ransomware, its impacts can impact patient care. For
instance:
•

In 2020 the CTI League learned of a cancer center Ransomware victim where staff and patients
had to try rebuilding treatment regimen from memory.

•

Diagnostic imaging techniques greatly improve outcomes in cases such as strokes and trauma,
so loss of these systems from Ransomware denies these benefits.

•

Delays in acute cardiac care, such as those when hospitals divert incoming ambulances to other
facilities, lead to a significant increase in mortality rate.

Ransomware during the COVID pandemic can impact healthcare across a city or a region. Under
normal conditions, a single hospital affected by ransomware can divert patients to other local
facilities which can absorb the additional load. Under COVID, many hospitals are already near or at
capacity and face workforce shortages, making it more likely that other facilities would reach or
exceed capacity from a single hospital going on diversion. A Ransomware attack, such as the one in
late 2020 in New England that hobbled over 100 facilities, could trigger a region-wide cascade.
The effects on patient care from a city-wide or regional care delivery overload can be dire and
heartbreaking. Stories have recently emerged from Los Angeles where the pandemic circumstances,
even without Ransomware, caused hospitals to stop taking in patients, and tied up ambulances for
hours waiting in line at emergency rooms across the city. Ransomware could make similar situations
more likely and more common.
At the same time, capabilities to prepare for and respond to Ransomware improve defenses against
other cybersecurity issues. Organizations can decrease their likelihood of becoming a victim and
reduce cost and time to recover. When adversaries exert more effort for a lesser impact, they tend
to focus elsewhere, deterring future attacks against the sector and allowing healthcare organizations
to continue delivering patient care to those who need it.

Figure 2 - Ransomware families by the number of healthcare organizations they have victimized

In March 2020, it is believed to have started with the hacking of Hammersmith Medicines Research in
London by the Maze ransomware group, who likely targeted Hammersmith because they were
researching a cure for COVID. CTIL Dark began extensive link analysis, intelligence collection, and
general forensics in coordination with strategic partners and international law enforcement to uncover
the actors’ actual identities to assist in criminal justice. Our analysts conducted extensive link analysis,
intelligence collection, and general forensics to help build a bigger picture. One of our analysts tracked
the threat actor back to suspected Command and Control (C2) nodes or proxies located in Russia. The
CTI League was able to share this information with Hammersmith IT teams, through our trust network,
so they could block communications with the suspicious infrastructure.

Figure 3 - Maze leaks data belonging to Hammersmith Medicines Research

Since the launch of the CTI League, the threat group that operates Maze ransomware shut down their
operations. CTIL Dark assess that the threat group is now operating the Egregor ransomware. CTIL Dark
assesses that the volume of ransomware attacks will continue into 2021. The actions of ransomware
groups will not slow down nor stop at the door of the healthcare industry. The CTI League continues to
pursue these groups and keep our healthcare and law enforcement partners apprised of our findings.
The CTI League assesses that Ransomware will remain one of the largest threats to healthcare delivery.
Threat actors are likely to continue increasing their attack sophistication and volume, across the sector
and their supply chain. The CTI League will continue to develop our tools to help our members track
and counter this threat.

Initial Access Brokers
With the increase in the number of employees working from home due to mandatory social distancing,
the business of Initial Access Brokers (IAB) has boomed in the year 2020. An IAB is someone who gains
access into a victim's network through several vectors, with the most common being through Remote
Desktop Protocol (RDP) and then selling that access to the highest bidder. RDP is consistently
compromised through a mix of open-source reconnaissance to find email formats and basic credential
stuffing attacks to uncover passwords without tipping off internal detection methods.

Figure 4 - Cybercriminal persona “hardknocklife” advertises RDP access to a US Hospital

In most cases, IABs sell directly to ransomware groups or become affiliates of Ransomware-as-a-Service
programs to ensure they get highly compensated for the victim access they acquire. From Q2 2020 to
Q4 2020, the number of IABs compromising and selling access to Healthcare and other lifesaving
organizations has more than doubled. The highest impacted regions by IABs targeting the healthcare
industry are North America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.

Opportunistic Cybercriminals
CTIL Dark have observed opportunistic cybercriminals within darknet marketplaces exploiting the fears
of individuals impacted by the COVID pandemic. This first became evident towards the end of Q2 when
there was a global supply chain shortage in PPE, COVID test kits, and other critically needed medical
items, which were observed advertised on multiple darknet marketplaces. One example observed was
the rapid increase in Hydroxychloroquine sales postings to treat the COVID virus shortly after the United
States president was shown on news media endorsing its use.
From Q2 to Q3 2020, the highest COVID-themed items advertised on darknet marketplaces were
Hydroxychloroquine and COVID test kits. CTIL Dark discovered that many vendors that changed to
advertising Hydroxychloroquine and other medical supplies on darknet marketplaces who previously
sold or were still selling illegal drugs such as heroin, fentanyl, and cocaine.

Figure 6 - COVID-themed medical advertisements in the cybercriminal underground

An example of an opportunistic cybercriminal is a darknet marketplace vendor using the pseudonym
"medsguru" who advertised the sale of 200mg of Hydroxychloroquine, citing a BBC article that quoted
President Trump's claims that the drug was approved in the US to treat the coronavirus. The use of
referencing legitimate media articles when advertising the sale of COVID-themed products was a
repeatable tactic observed by the CTIL Dark researchers during our monitoring of opportunistic
cybercriminals.

Figure 7 - Cybercriminal persona “medsguru” advertises Hydroxycloroquine for sale on a darknet market

CTIL Dark assess that these opportunistic cybercriminals will continue to monitor and respond
accordingly to the general publics' needs of the COVID pandemic. Like the Hydroxychloroquine trend,
several other public trends emerge as long as the COVID virus remains a priority of concern to the
general public. These trends can emerge through media reports, public and political figures making
claims, and the spread of disinformation campaigns started by Nation-state threats.

Disinformation Campaigns
CTIL Dark has assessed during our research that disinformation, misinformation, and conspiracy theories
of COVID is one of the biggest threats to the general public’s health and safety. For context, we have
defined the topic as follows:
•

Misinformation is false or misleading information that’s potentially harmful. For example, a claim
that COVID doesn’t exist. This is spread directly or indirectly by unsuspecting individuals – often
times through sharing posts in social media.

•

Disinformation is the deliberate promotion of false, misleading, or misattributed information, usually
designed to change the beliefs or actions of large numbers of people. This is usually created and
initially spread deliberately, often by government or intelligence agencies through the use of
personas carefully crafted to appear to have credentials of authority (Medical Doctors or PhD
credentials) or through the use of social media amplification technology (“bots”).

•

Conspiracy Theories are misinformation which, in context, is beyond reasonable credibility.
Conspiracy theories can be part of Disinformation campaigns.

Collection and analysis within select Tor Markets and fringe social media platforms revealed indications
that adversaries used strategic narratives to create tactical messaging. The COVID campaigns appeared
to fall within three common misinformation themes: 1) Receiving the vaccine resulted in significant
neurological side effects (specifically Bell’s Palsy),
2) All COVID vaccines have a hidden intention of
global depopulation, and 3) The vaccine is not
needed because other medications such as Niacin
are more medically effective.

These narratives

received ongoing discussions within messaging
platforms known to incubate misinformation, such
as 4Chan and 8Kun. At the same time, engagement
of established personas and imposter websites
would move to target the more widely used social
media platforms.

The third campaign of note: the use of Niacin, was observed to be referenced and promoted highly by
the conspiracy theory group QAnon
and later promoted by the same
community on Twitter1.

Misinformation and Disinformation are likely to continue as growing concerns for healthcare and public
perception of COVID. Medical disinformation with narratives around Covid19, personal protection
measures including masks, and anti-vaccination narratives continue. Groups like QAnon are likely to
continue and to be joined by more groups and new groups. Since January 2021, more groups are
focused on disinformation mitigation and countermeasures, but despite that, disinformation is likely to
continue as a technique in cyber-cognitive and physical-cognitive hybrid attacks.3

Scammers
The emergence of individuals and groups looking to scam people out of money in a pandemic is nothing
new and was something CTIL Dark expected. As was widely reported, the COVID miracle cure sites came
first. Scammers set these up to exploit fears and influence the individuals to click phishing links. Then
came the Tor-based COVID vaccine scam sites that urged their victims to pay in Bitcoin for their miracle
cures

Figure 11 - Tor-based scam site advertising COVID vaccines for $120 in Bitcoin

The CTI league was instrumental in taking down more than 2,000 of these scam sites since the pandemic
began. CTIL Dark tracked the threat actors coordinating their setup on criminal forums, monitoring
which domains they were setting up to host their fraudulent sites and reporting to the domain hosting
companies of the violations. Our observation is that sites ending in .info were often the preferred
domain choice, as it gave the perception of the legitimacy of passing factual information on the
pandemic.

Figure 12 - Product image for fake COVID treatment

CTIL Dark also took an active role in gathering intelligence and information on named threat actors.
One example is a UK national who advertised a COVID cure. CTIL Dark Intelligence Collectors reached
out to the individual to gather more information. Starting in a public forum and moving the
conversations to a more secure direct messaging, the actor provided enough personal information that
CTIL Dark could uncover his real identity and location. CTIL Dark gave the relevant evidence to law
enforcement for further action.
Scams tracked COVID-themed trends alongside stages of the pandemic to exploit target fear and
curiosity. From miracle cures when the virus effects were not clear, into vaccine scamming now.
Therefore, the CTIL Dark assesses that scammers will continue to adapt to emerging COVID-themed
trends in 2021.

Phishing
Since the beginning of the pandemic there have been a number of different COVID-themed phishing
campaigns preying on the fears of the general public. These campaigns have included the COVID
vaccine, the John Hopkins Coronavirus map and various other tempting lures to target fearful
individuals. CTIL Dark assesses with that these COVID-themed phishing campaigns will continue so long
as the Coronavirus is relevant to the general public.
Most are aware of the fake
COVID map that a cybercriminal
group made to mimic the
original Johns Hopkins map.
The original map was crucial in
disseminating information in
the opening days of the crisis.

various forms.
CTIL Dark discovered the creators of the map in underground forums were ecstatic that their malwareinfected Coronavirus map was making its round in Forbes and actively bragging about it. CTIL Dark
Human Intelligence (HUMINT) collectors engaged with the malware creators by fueling their ego to
exchange for valuable intelligence. The actors bragged about who was interested in purchasing the
map, where they were from, and what they intended to do with the malware. Throughout these
discussions, the CTIL Dark HUMINT collectors shared the information with global Law Enforcement
partners and Hospital IT teams.

Databases
In Q2, CTIL Dark identified an increase in medical Databases containing PHI being advertised within
several underground forums and marketplaces. These databases were all obtained at one point or
another through a malicious actor stealing the contents of the database after initially breaching a
medical organization. The information within these databases can be used by threat actors in targeted
attacks on the patients themselves.

Figure 15 - Cybercriminal persona “Skyscraper” advertises a database with 250,000 hospital records

In other cases, threat actors will consolidate multiple hospital employees' data obtained from several
databases and then sell it as one database to threat actors who may want to breach hospitals in a
particular region in the world. Malicious actors can use hospital employee information to target each
employee from many different hospitals simultaneously until they find the one that will help them gain
access to their hospital's network.

Figure 16 - Cybercriminal persona “3lv4n” advertises a database with 34,000 UAE hospital employee data

CTIL Dark assesses that the buying, selling, leaking and trading of healthcare databases that include PHI
and other sensitive information on patients and medical staff will continue in 2021. Threat Actors may
use this information for immediate financial gain or as a way to find a target entry point into another
more lucrative victim organization.

CTIL Dark in Action
CTIL Dark has been called into action on numerous occasions. Two incidents resulted in major wins for
the CTIL Dark team, our Law Enforcement partners, and the victim organizations who were able to
mitigate these threats before major damage was done. These efforts directly resulted in actionable
intelligence that allowed for Law enforcement and local CERTs to assist the victim organizations that
were impacted.

Polish nationwide hospital alerting
In early June, around 1:00 a.m. Eastern Time, a CTIL Dark intelligence collector had a source contact
them regarding the sale of RDP access to a state-run hospital in Eastern Europe on the dark web for
$1000. As the researcher alerted the other team members, they set forth on corroborating the threat
via other methods. Multiple sources of information were collected quickly to substantiate the Polish
hospital’s vulnerability and confirm the findings. Simultaneously, a CTI League partner with the Polish
Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT.PL) analyzed the data and escalated an alert to every
hospital in Poland for their internal IT teams to harden the identified vulnerabilities to disrupt the RDP
access.

Figure 17 - Cybercriminal persona (redacted) advertising RDP access to a Polish hospital

From the initial report to disseminating the information to every state hospital in Poland, the
international team of CTI league members took 3 hours, including finding multiple sources and
intelligence types to corroborate the initial claim.

Pre-empting access to large Catholic Healthcare Organization
CTIL Dark identified a Russian-speaking threat actor on an underground fraud forum selling Remote
Desktop Protocol access to one of the largest Catholic healthcare systems in the United States. The
threat actor claims that the institution has an annual revenue of $18 Billion and 86,000 employees. The
advertisement is listed at $5,000. The screenshots reveal that the threat actor could be reached via
XMPP, an instant messaging platform for encrypted communications.

CTIL Dark submitted this alert to authorities and organizations affiliated with the Catholic Archdiocese
and the top three Catholic healthcare organizations that matched the threat actor's description.

Summary
CTIL Dark, the CTI League participants, strategic partners, and law enforcement members worldwide
have created through the shared values of trust a community in which we dedicated our skills to
providing healthcare organizations worldwide with real-time intelligence on cyber threats to their
infrastructures. The CTI League is proud of our members, the contributions they have made, and we will
continue to work with law enforcement to protect healthcare organizations worldwide in their ongoing
battle with cyber threats.
In 2020, threat actors firmly fixated on the healthcare sector. Their increased attention led to a largescale
rise in harmful and disruptive effects on the global COVID pandemic response. As with many of the risks
it faced in the past hear, healthcare was simply overwhelmed and unable to cope with the volume of
cyber threats.
Attack trends are rising as we enter 2021, and so the healthcare community will have to improve even
farther, even faster if it wants to keep pace. This will take a whole of society effort, among government,
citizens, industry, and communities such as the CTI League.

If you work in law enforcement, healthcare organization, or the cybersecurity community, we encourage
you to join our community to protect society against COVID. Apply at https://cti-league.com/join.

About the CTI League
The CTI League is a global non-profit organization derived by a community, with the vision of creating
a safer cyberspace for healthcare/public health and emergency services organizations worldwide from
cyber-attacks. Established in March 2020, the CTI League’s community of professionals has more than
1,500 vetted volunteer cybersecurity experts and collaborates with government agencies, law
enforcement, healthcare, telecommunications, and technology companies globally. CTI League
volunteers prevent harm to human life and COVID response by supplying reliable information about
cyberattacks, threat actors, and vulnerabilities to our stakeholders.
The CTI League believes in collective actions, contribution and facilitating the resources of each member
of the community to maximum. Within the CTI League there is an elite team of security researchers and
law enforcement personnel who monitor cybercriminal underground networks within the Darknet and
Deep/Dark web. Their days are spent looking for signs of data breaches, targeted attacks, and any other
cybercriminal activity that may impact the medical industry or general public health.
We call this team CTI League Dark. This multidisciplinary team empowers each member and builds
goodwill through collaboration, working as a united group to protect the healthcare sector. CTIL Dark
focuses on three different aspects of threats:
•

Threats on the health ecosystem – CTIL Dark focuses on discovering emerging threats to
organizations providing life-saving care and in the health supply chain. CTIL Dark provides an
overview of the risks that can affect an organization’s networks and disrupt their ability to save lives.
Data breaches, network access, and compromised assets offered for sale in the darknet are examples
of these threats.

•

Threat actors operating in the darknet – CTIL Dark provides actionable threat intelligence to our law
enforcement partners on the specific threat actor Personas of Interest (POI) who are targeting the
health ecosystem.

•

Threats to Public Health and Safety – CTIL Dark is focused on finding cyber threats to public health
and safety such as the purchase of fake COVID vaccines. These fake vaccines can result in a fatal
infection or even death. The CTI League escalates the threats discovered to inform our associates
and law enforcement partners for the next steps.
