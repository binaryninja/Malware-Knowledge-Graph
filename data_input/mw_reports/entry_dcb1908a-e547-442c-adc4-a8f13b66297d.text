A new phishing email is trying to take advantage of the Coronavirus pandemic and the race
to develop medications by promoting a fake Folding@home app that installs an informationstealing malware.
Folding@home is a well-known distributed computing project that allows users to download
software that uses CPU and GPU cycles to research new drug opportunities against
diseases and a greater understanding of various diseases.
As the COVID-19 epidemic spreads throughout the world, Folding@home has added over 20
new projects focusing on coronavirus research and has seen a huge increase in usage by
people all over the world.

Scammers take advantage of a good thing
With the rise in popularity of Folding@home, security researchers at ProofPoint have
discovered a new phishing campaign that pretends to be from a company developing a cure
for Coronavirus.

These emails have a subject of "Please help us with Fighting corona-virus" and state that
they want you to help "speed up our process of finding the cure" by downloading and
installing the Folding@home client.

The text of this email reads:
Greetings from Mobility Research Inc and Folding@Thome
As we all know, recently corona-virus is becoming a major threat to the human
society. We are a leading institution working on the cure to solve this world-wide
crisis. However, we need your help. With your contribution, you can speed up our
process of finding the cure. The process is very simple, you will need to install an
app on your computer, which will allow us to use it to run simulations of the cure.

Embedded in the phishing email is a "Download now" button that when clicked will download
a file called foldingathomeapp.exe, which is the Redline information-stealing Trojan.
"RedLine Stealer is new malware available for sale on Russian underground forums with
several pricing options: $150 lite version; $200 pro version; $100 / month subscription
option. It steals information from browsers such as login, autocomplete, passwords, and
2/4

credit cards. It also collects information about the user and their system such as the
username, their location, hardware configuration, and installed security software. A recent
update to RedLine Stealer also added the ability to steal cryptocurrency cold wallets,"
ProofPoint states in their report.
Once installed, the malware will connect to a remote site to receive commands as to what
types of data should be stolen from the victim. These instructions are sent using the SOAP
messaging protocol as seen by the image below.

RedLine getting instructions
This malware can steal saved login credentials, credit cards, cookies, and autocomplete
fields from browsers. It can also collect data from FTP and IM clients, steal files, download
files, execute commands, and send information back about the computer.
You can see an example of this malware in action in an Any.run session performed by
security researcher James.
As this malware can steal a large amount of information, anyone who has fallen victim to this
scam should immediately perform a scan using antivirus software.
They should also change the passwords at any online accounts that they frequent as they
may now be in the possession of the attackers. This should be done from another computer
until they are sure their infected computer has been cleaned.
It should also be noted that Folding@home is a terrific project and just because people are
performing scams in their name, does not mean it should be avoided.
3/4

Just be sure to download the Folding@home client only from the legitimate site.
