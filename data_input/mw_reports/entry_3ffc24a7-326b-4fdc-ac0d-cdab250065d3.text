Hacking the Industrial Network
Is Your Production Line or Process Management System at Risk?

The Problem
Malicious code, a Trojan program deliberately inserted into SCADA system software, manipulated valve positions
and compressor outputs to cause a massive natural gas explosion along the Trans-Siberian pipeline, according to
2005 testimony before a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee by a Director from Sandia National
Laboratories.1 According to the Washington Post, the resulting fireball yielded “the most monumental non-nuclear
explosion and fire ever seen from space.”2 The explosion was subsequently estimated at the equivalent of 3
kilotons.3 (In comparison, the 9/11 explosions at the World Trade Center were roughly 0.1 kiloton.)
According to Internet blogs and reports, hackers have begun to discover that SCADA (Supervisory Control and
Data Acquisition) and DCS (Distributed Control Systems) are “cool” to hack.4 The interest of hackers has
increased since reports of successful attacks began to emerge after 2001. A security consultant interviewed by the
in-depth news program, PBS Frontline, told them “Penetrating a SCADA system that is running a Microsoft
operating system takes less than two minutes.”5 DCS, SCADA, PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) and other
legacy control systems have been used for decades in power plants and grids, oil and gas refineries, air traffic and
railroad management, pipeline pumping stations, pharmaceutical plants, chemical plants, automated food and
beverage lines, industrial processes, automotive assembly lines, and water treatment plants.
Sandia National Laboratories has been chartered over the last 15 years with testing and improving the security of
U.S. infrastructure control systems. When interviewed by Frontline, they confirm that their Red Team has never
failed to penetrate a U.S. system using publicly available methods. When they refer to the term SCADA, they
include all real-time digital control systems, process control systems and other related technologies.
The History
Introduced in the late 1960s, PLCs were designed to eliminate the higher cost of complicated, relay-based control
systems. By the 1980s, Distributed Control Systems achieved popularity within increasingly automated plant
environments, with keyboards and workstations replacing large, individual control cabinets. Entire production lines
and processes could be linked over industrial cable/bus networks (Modbus, Profibus, Fieldbus and others) to
provide monitoring and control to a foreman’s desk. Dials, gauges and idiot lights were replaced by a pictorial
representation of the process with fields displaying real-time information. The available systems were
“proprietary,” capturing market share by staying incompatible with competitive systems. By 1998, however,
customers were beginning to demand open systems, common protocols and vendor interoperability. This closely

mirrors the way that computer network standardization developed, but industrial networks have been far more
resistant to open system competition. They remained largely incompatible.
It is also true that any given facility, be it a public utility, process, or production line, will contain a mix of old and
new technologies. There will be rudimentary systems that remain in place because they still work, and new high
speed processes that reflect the latest developments in efficiency and reduced cost. The oldest systems may have
been designed or installed by long-departed engineers, and the documentation on these systems may be sketchy, as
will be the documentation of modifications made over time.
Ethernet
It was obvious from the beginning of the new millennium that the next logical step would be the requirement of
Ethernet connectivity between the front office and the plant or processes. Ethernet triumphed as the de facto
network choice for corporate administration more than a decade ago. It was only a matter of time before it
migrated to the management of the factory floor.
Ethernet offers instant access to shared data for multiple departments – inventory, shipping and receiving,
purchasing, accounting, production, sales, CAD/CAM engineering and process control. Standardization, real-time
access and better communication across the entire enterprise are some of the driving forces. Other drivers are
that Ethernet network equipment and applications are readily available, less expensive, easier to install, maintain
and administrate.6
A new industrial revolution is taking place on the factory floor as corporations discover the economic benefits of
integrating their Information Technology (IT) networks with legacy process control and production systems.
Moore’s Law effectively predicted that processor speeds will double every 18 months. This means that new
gadgets and smaller, better, faster computers have been developed with revolutionary speed. But while the IT and
computer-based markets evolve rapidly, the industrial side of the end-user market is fairly slow to adapt. It is
sometimes considered too expensive to do so, or too disruptive to the process or production. NASA’s Space
Shuttle control systems and the FAA Air Traffic Control systems are antiquated by decades because it is too
expensive and disruptive to update them.
Capital equipment is intended for long-term use, and is likely to remain in use for 10-20 years, until the capital
expenditure has been amortized. As a result, it is not uncommon to find that the processors used in the
equipment controls may be older versions, such as Intel 486, 386, or even 286 chips, as well as older versions of
operating systems. These obsolete, reduced performance processors have long been grandfathered, and there is a
lack of support for upgrades or software-based security solutions for obsolete technology. Even more critical are
the security risks for older Windows operating systems such as Windows 98, because Microsoft no longer
supports these versions with security updates.
It should be noted that mainstream support for Windows 2000 has expired and extended support will be dropped
by July 2010. Security issues with Windows Vista are currently being reported with considerable frequency.
Similar problems exist for PCs running on the operating systems from other manufacturers. Often, older versions
are no longer supported and security holes can no longer be closed through software patches. And some
processes or production lines cannot easily be interrupted to install frequent patches or software upgrades. An
upgrade must be tested and proven “to do no harm” before incorporated into a production line.
There are a wide range of security technologies that can be used to protect the corporate network, but these are
less successful within a production network. Traditional hardware-based systems (routers, bridges) used in the
corporate network have the drawback that they can always be identified based on their Internet Protocol (IP)
address – and are therefore highly susceptible to attack. This is particularly due to the fact that in many systems,
specific numbered ports are left open in order to ensure unproblematic data transfer via the Internet connection.7

Unfortunately, software-based solutions (personal firewalls, anti-virus software) have other limitations: namely,
they cannot run on some proprietary operating systems, due to lack of compatibility. Moreover, they often can’t
be integrated into systems which use older processor technology – because these lack the necessary performance.
Blocking a virus attack would demand so much of the processor’s abilities that the whole system would be
paralyzed. It should be mentioned that vulnerable software constantly requires updates – otherwise viruses can
easily attack the operating system time and again through newly detected security holes. Yet such updates are
complex, requiring extensive resources in manpower and capital.
Figure 1 illustrates a brief chronological history of publicly reported hacking incidents that provide a chilling insight
into the problems and their potential for disruption and disaster. Some of these damaging exploits were kept
secret for years. Many more incidents go unreported for reasons of national security or corporate embarrassment.
Even more go undetected. Properly executed, successful hacks are undetectable and untraceable. Professional
hackers, criminal organizations, terrorists and nation states can conceal their attacks by using fast-flux to bounce
their actions through thousands of botnet zombie computers located in other nations. Critical industrial design
information can be stolen, stored on remotely enslaved computers, and resold or ransomed back to the owner.8

The threat comes in many forms. It does not need to be an intelligently directed attack. The non-intelligent
Slammer worm covered the globe in 30 minutes, infected business and Pentagon computers in the first eight
minutes, and caused $3 billion worth of damage to Wall Street.10 Amateur soviet “kiddie-scripters” brought down
“the most wired country in Europe” for two weeks through denial-of-service attacks by simply using botnets
located in Egypt, Vietnam and Peru.11 Attacks on electrical and pipeline networks may seize the popular
imagination, but the same industrial control networks are used in the production of everything from cars to candy
bars. Worms and viruses can cause damage as easily as direct hacks.

Common Objections and Rationalizations
“Our production systems are completely isolated from outside access.”
In the 1980s, when almost everything was analog, this was largely true. But since that time, plant operators and
engineers have migrated to PC-based monitoring and controls, using graphical overlays to illustrate the facility
processes in real time. Engineering and management PCs also have access to the larger corporate network, as well
as the Internet and Intranet. In his book “The Art of Intrusion,” expert Kevin Mittnick clearly explains how a
hacker, even a neophyte, can easily gain root (administrator) access to the entire network through the
corporation’s public website, from anywhere in the world.12
It is common practice to include access to Web-based services on most programmable logic controllers.
According to a major manufacturer of PLCs, the majority of their products are ordered with Web services
enabled. Yet their own study indicated that only 13% of customers actually configured and used the Web services.
So 87% of users left the Web servers in the PLCs active with factory default passwords, like “1111.”13
“Our system is secure because it would be impossible for an outsider to understand it.”
This is nicknamed “security by obscurity” and has repeatedly been shown to be a false assumption. If the
weaknesses in millions of lines of “indecipherable” computer operating system code can be hacked, the
rudimentary logic instruction of a Digital Control System offers few obstacles. Engineered for safety, systems are
designed to perform an emergency shutdown when any or all of a string of dangerous conditions are detected by
instruments. These may include high/low limits of pressure, flow, temperature, liquid level, voltage, speed,
explosivity or other parameters that could lead to a condition that damages equipment or threatens personnel
safety. Recognizing and identifying such logic strings or icons on a ladder diagram is simplicity itself, even if the
entire process is not completely understood.
There are only 5-6 leading DCS and SCADA systems used throughout the world, and there are millions of US and
foreign engineers who have been trained in their use and implementation. Any suburban library will have on its
shelves a dozen technical books on the precise methods of computer hacking. Cisco publishes a respected
textbook titled “Penetration Testing and Network Defense,” which can be applied to penetrate corporate
systems.14 And a new textbook titled “Hacking SCADA – Industrial Network Security from the Mind of the
Attacker” is being offered on the Internet.15 Most of the SCADA manufacturers are foreign owned and most of US
critical infrastructure technology products are now manufactured overseas.16
“We’re not a likely target. We’re not important or interesting enough to attract hackers.”
Individual personal computers are pinged and probed and tested every day while they are connected to the
Internet. Regardless of the quality of antivirus software installed, malware (Trojans, viruses and worms) can be
inadvertently downloaded from the Internet, and these can replicate themselves on portable memory devices of all
types. In 2008, it was determined that digital picture frames, imported from China and sold by major big-box
retailers (Best Buy, Sam’s Club, Target, Costco) were infected with a program that disabled antivirus software and
then sent passwords and financial information to servers in China.17 And the software was analyzed as being far
more capable and more sophisticated than required for these simple tasks.18 Two colonels of the Chinese People’s
Liberation Army (PLA) had previously published “Unrestricted Warfare,” noting the use of computer network
attacks, and the PLA has since coined the term “Integrated Network Electronic Warfare.”19

“We’ve never had a problem. There has been no intrusion or disruption in our production network.”
Following the successful “Eligible Receiver” attack on U.S. Department of Defense networks, new computer
hardware and software was installed to see if anyone was getting in without permission. Within weeks of
installation they showed that thousands of attempted illegal penetrations were going on daily. One general was
incensed. “Before we had these IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems), we were never attacked. Now that we got
them on the network, people are attacking our nets every day thousands of times trying to get in! And some of
them are getting in!” 20
“It hasn’t happened yet, so it seems unlikely. I don’t think it will happen.”
No one thought that commercial passenger jets would be hijacked and simultaneously flown into skyscrapers
either. Or that a mediocre storm, Hurricane Katrina, would largely destroy New Orleans for years. Or that a
sudden financial crisis would bring worldwide production to a virtual standstill.
“We can’t justify the expense and manpower.”
The expense of protection is a fraction of 1% of the IT budget. With the latest generation of equipment, a network
of protection can be installed, plug and play, by a handful of technicians rather than IT managers. Production need
not be interrupted. A security template, chosen by IT personnel from a CD loaded onto a server will automatically
configure the parameters and level of protection for whole groups of thousands of devices. While Return on
Investment (ROI) is in the range of several hundred percent a year, the simplest justification is “What will we
suffer if a disaster shuts us down?”

Figure 2: Applications and Systems at Risk
Industry Recommendations
The consequences of production interruption in the industrial sector are much more serious than failures within
the office network. If a production line fails for several hours, it can result in a much higher cost to the company
than when a PC crashes in the office.
In 2005, the Zotob worm simultaneously attacked 175 major corporations including Caterpillar, General Electric,
DaimlerChrysler and United Parcel Service.21 Thirteen U.S. DaimlerChrysler plants had to be shut down, idling

their assembly lines and 50,000 workers.22 What do you think that cost per hour? The worm was later determined
to have originated in Turkey, and linked with a credit card fraud ring.23

“Thirteen U.S. DaimlerChrysler plants had to be shut down, idling their assembly lines and 50,000
workers. What do you think that cost per hour?”

Corporate firewalls provide access security against Internet attacks from the outside world. Firewalls can protect
corporate networks from most external intruders. But the most harmful programs, capable of paralyzing
automation systems, are often introduced internally. Surveys reveal that roughly 40% of security incidents involved
insiders.24
External service technicians and contractors may need to be given network access, and employees and visiting
consultants with laptops can inadvertently (or deliberately) introduce malicious software behind the external
firewall. The so-called security cordon of firewalls at border crossings between departments often does not
provide adequate protection. Effective decentralized approaches - referred to as “defense-in-depth” and “endpoint
security” in the literature - are required, as are corresponding systems for the security of endpoint devices. In
principle, architectures with small, distributed security systems are preferred.
The latest recommendation by the ARC Advisory Group (Automation Research Corporation) and the U.S.
National Laboratories chartered to protect the economic technical infrastructure is to provide “defense-in-depth”
by employing a distributed architecture with multiple firewalls and/or layers of firewalls.25 Just as mainframe
computing evolved into PC networks, “defense-in-depth” security protection offers greater security, flexibility and
lower cost.
How much money would be lost if production is interrupted for an hour, a day, or a month? It is a simple Return
on Investment equation. But establishing production network security bears a close relationship to the logic of
adhering to fire codes. If production capability is lost or irreversibly damaged, the total damage to the organization
and its employees is multiplied, widespread and very expensive.
The Solution
A 2006 study by industrial network planners Röwaplan AG compared the total costs of distributed versus
centralized security architectures.26 In a centralized approach, production system wiring leads to high first
investment costs. The concentration of data terminals in the production area is usually low, so the utilization of
switch and router modules for a centralized architecture is not high enough to provide a cost-effective solution. A
distributed architecture is more economical.
The ideal solution would require several unique features. It should provide distributed “defense-in-depth” as a
second or third layer of protection. It should be capable of providing various levels of security. It should be easy to
implement, by technicians rather than network administrators, without modification to the network’s existing
configuration.
Templates for devices should be configurable for single units or very large groups from a central location. It should
be available in various appliance configurations, such as industrial mount, PCI card, patch cord dongle, and hotswap blades for a rack mounted backplane. It should be applicable in various network configurations. And it should
provide hardware and software-based security concepts in a single component that can be seamlessly patched
between the network and the segment to be protected. No drivers or additional software should be required.

It should be capable of protecting network, broadband, ISDN or dial-up modem connections. It should provide a
“Stateful Inspection Firewall” that monitors incoming and outgoing data packets based on pre defined rules offering
secure and confidential communication via Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnels. Ideally, the solution and firewall
should be invisible to detection by intruders attempting to map the network. It is also much harder for worms and
viruses to attack the system if they cannot see it. Network Address Translation (NAT) could be used to provide
protection by IP address masquerading.
Specific industrial solutions exist. They may be lesser known in the IT world because they exist in the industrial
space, and they may be lesser known in the security world, where there is a tendency to concentrate on physical
security and physical access. They are fairly known and marketed through industrial control suppliers, but there
often exists a legacy misconception that the industrial network remains independent of the IT network, or that IT
firewalls are sufficient. Having just one firewall as a gateway to the entire production network is insufficient
protection.

Figure 4: Various Network Configurations
Remote maintenance and diagnostics by vendor/supplier partners, for complex equipment provided by them, has
become popular because it is far more economical than flying a technician halfway around the world to resolve a
problem. Unfortunately, dedicated modems have previously been employed to provide access, and modems are
notorious as unprotected backdoors into the network. The ideal solution would be one that denies access, even
by the original manufacturer of the equipment, except when the equipment operations people request it, and when
the connection is strictly authenticated, preferably via digital certificates of authority.
Some industrial-based solutions are already available. Products include Phoenix Contact FL mGuard™, Byers
Tofino, Siemens Scalance, Weidmüller IE, Emerson Delta V firewall, Hirschmann Eagle mGuard™, and Innominate
mGuard™. But it was only Innominate Security Technologies AG, the original developer of mGuard, that won the
Frost & Sullivan “2008 Global Ethernet Security Product Value Leadership of the Year Award,” for their mGuard™
product family.27
Some of the products listed above are derived from the Innominate product set or licensed and rebranded OEM
products based on earlier Innominate software releases.28 For the protection of individual production cells, the
mGuard™ security devices are used in a decentralized, distributed architecture. These security appliances, a
combination of hardware and software, have been designed specifically for use in industrial environments. They
combine the characteristics of a “Stateful Inspection Firewall” that offers options for encrypted, authenticated
communication via VPN connections. An internationally patented “Stealth Mode” conceals the existence of the
device, making it invisible to unauthorized detection via NAT IP masquerading. It offers high security for remote
maintenance applications and an anti-virus engine with free updates. High availability is provided through built-in
router redundancy. The excellent suitability for industrial applications lies in the fulfillment of relevant industrial

standards and the ability to integrate with industrial controls, such as controllers, IPCs, Panel PCs, machinery and
plant networks. It is IP 20 rated for harsh industrial environments.

Figure 5: A remote services unit for DIN rail mounting with integrated analog modem or ISDN
terminal adapter
Users are often concerned about the costs of design, configuration and maintenance of the network components.
But the cost is not linear and decreases as the number of security devices rises, provided there is a central device
management solution. Such a software-based Innominate Device Manager™ provides sophisticated templates,
automated hierarchy, and an integrated Certificate Authority to produce VPN certificates with a high degree of
automation in the configuration and updating of individual devices.
Thus, with a push-pull mechanism, a central management console supplies needed information to the decentralized
components.
Figure 6 illustrates a variety of application points within the zones of a typical office/factory network. Physically
different versions of the product are incorporated as required. In a telecommunications room, a backplane
mounted in a 19” frame can effectively handle multiple paths from a single location. Multiple PCs, such as in an
engineering group, can be protected with a slimline, rackmount unit. Individual PCs can be protected with PCI
cards. HMI (Human Machine Interface) stations on the factory floor can be protected by modules that can be DIN
rail mounted into NEMA cabinets. And portable dongle-style patchcord units can be used by remote technicians,
engineers and consultants whenever they access the Internet or the network.
