Hunting Libyan Scorpions

Executive Summary
Libya maybe known in non-stable political system, civil war and militant groups fighting for the land and oil
control but it is definitely not known in cyber malicious activities, cyber espionage and hacking groups. No
parties in Libya before this analysis reported to use cyber attacks, malwares nor recruit hackers to spy on their
rivals. Today we have a different story.
In the past weeks on 6 August 2016, Cyberkov Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) received a numerous
Android malwares operating in different areas in Libya especially in Tripoli and Benghazi.
The malware spreads very fast using Telegram messenger application in smartphones, targeting high-profile
Libyan influential and political figures.
The malware first discovery was after a highly Libyan influential Telegram account compromised via web
Telegram using IP address from Spain.
The following day, the attackers spread an Android malware binded with legitimate Android application from
the compromised Telegram account to all his contacts pretending it is an important voice message (misspelled
it by “Voice Massege.apk”) which indicates a non-english (maybe an Arabic) attacker.
After spreading the malware, more Android smartphones has been infected using the same technique (via
Telegram) and then repost the malware again and again making a network of victims.
Analysis of this incident led us to believe that this operation and the group behind it which we call Libyan
Scorpions is a malware operation in use since September 2015 and operated by a politically motivated group
whose main objective is intelligence gathering, spying on influentials and political figures and operate an
espionage campaign within Libya.
Also, the analysis of the incident led to the discovery of multiple malwares targeting Android and Windows
machines.

„

„

Libyan Scorpions threat actors used a set of methods to hide and operate their malwares. They appear not to
have highly technical skills but a good social engineering and phishing tricks. The threat actors are not
particularly sophisticated, but it is well-understood that such attacks don’t need to be sophisticated in order
to be effective.

Using malwares as weapon in an active warzone such as Libya, make
the victims easy targets for assassination or kidnapping by tracking
their physical locations and monitoring them day and night.

Hunting Libyan Scorpions

Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs)
Libyan Scorpions is believed to be a political motivated group targeting a high-level influential and political
figures in multiple cities within Libya.
Libyan Scorpions first compromised a personal Telegram account for a Libyan influential person with
unknown vector. The victim received a push notification from his Telegram app that someone from Spain is
logged into his account:

The victim mistakenly deleted Telegram application from his phone thinking that this is going to stop the
attacker(s).
Second day, the attacker used the victim phone number to spear phish his contacts in Telegram by pretending
that the real person is sending a voice message while the file is actually a malicious APK (Android Package) file.

This APK file targets only Android-based smartphones. Once the new victim click on the APK file, the
application installs itself in the device without any problem and is fully functional. The icon of the application
appears in the Apps menu named (URL Shortener).

Malware Analysis
Cyberkov Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) started analyzing the APK file (malware) and the first step
was to unpack it.

After unpacking with apktool and reading (AndroidManifest.xml) file, it appears that the application is a
malware injected inside a legitimate application having java package name:
de.keineantwort.android.urlshortener.

The application exists in the store and the Libyan Scorpions hacking group took an instance of the APK and
injected their malware into that legitimate application to spread it.
The real application is created by keineantwort.de and we have verified it from their main website:

Going back to (AndroidManifest.xml) file, the malware register itself as receiver of almost all intents and
request almost all permissions available in Android system!

The malware can access location, network state, battery status, Bluetooth, camera, capturing audio,
internet, …, etc.
After launching the malicious application for the first time, it checks if the Android device is rooted or not
and if rooted, it asks for root permission.

Carrying on the reverse engineering of the malware, we found a file called “config.json” which is a base64
encoded json file containing the configuration of the malware and its Command and Control (C2). The
characteristics of the malware (“a.txt” and “config.json” files) and the functionality of it is very similar to
JSocket and AlienSpy famous Android Remote Access Tools (RATs).

Decoding the “config.json” file using base64 decoder shows that the C2 hostname/domain is:
winmeif.myq-see.com using the port 64631
Resolving the hostname gives: 41.208.110.46 which is a static Libyan IP address owned by Libya Telecom
and Technology Backbone.

The picture below showing that the malware is capable of taking pictures from the camera of the
compromised device and upload it to the C2.

The malware begins by implementing a Trust Manager that accepts all certificates so that Libyan Scorpions
hackers are sure no victim left disconnected due to SSL certificates issues.

The malware uses Allatori Java Obfuscator to protect the code and make it harder to reverse engineer and it
obviously uses communication protocol based on Java JSON objects encapsulated in SSL connection wrapper.
Again, this behavior and characteristics of the malware is very similar to JSocket and AlienSpy Android RATs.

After finalizing the analysis of the Android malware, Cyberkov uploaded it to VirusTotal to see if it has been
uploaded before and what information we can get from it:

Cyberkov discovered that the malware has not been uploaded to VirusTotal before and the first sample of
this malware has been uploaded by us. However, 8 out of 54 AntiVirus engines detect it which is a very low
detection rate (15%). Most and major American top Gartner Antivirus companies did not detect it!!

Command and Control Communication
Cyberkov tried to discover the attacker behind this malicious application by sinkholing the malware and
analyzing the real C2.

Sinkhole
Cyberkov created a fake server simulating the real C2 of the Libyan Scorpions hacking group and sinkholed
the malware to study the behavior of the malware deeply.
Upon connection to the C2, the malware sends a lot of information about the target including: Country,
Malware Path, Local IP Address, RAM, Android Version, Device Name, …, etc.

Real C2
By connecting to the real C2 IP address, Cyberkov found that the malware is really of JSocket/AlienSpy family
of RATs since that family of RATs open the port 1234 with a self-signed certificate of “assylias”2.

According to Shodan, the port (1234) has been spotted open since 12-07-2016 which is 25 days before the
first discovery.

Threat Actor and Attribution
Seems like the Libyan Scorpions threat actors are running multiple Android RATs since numerous ports
protected by SSL layer are open in (winmeif.myq-see.com) machine.

Also, the Libyan Scorpions threat actors left phpinfo.php script on the webserver running on port 80 with
useful information that could expose them. Their machine is running Windows 7 Professional Service Pack 1.

Threat Actors Infrastructure
Going back to the IP address of the attackers (41.208.110.46), it is very important to discover the attackers
infrastructure that maybe used to launch wider attacks using multiple RATs on multiple platforms.
By using Threat Intelligence Platforms and Feeds such as PassiveTotal, Cyberkov was able to discover more
activities and campaigns run by Libyan Scorpions.
The following Heatmap shows that the IP address (41.208.110.46) has been used to launch attacks since
9/9/2015 until the time of writing this report using 5 different hostnames and multiple malicious malwares.

The following table summarizes the list of hostnames used by the attacker(s):
