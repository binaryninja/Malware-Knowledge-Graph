Encryption Process for The First Data
1.

RSA encryption
○
○

2.
3.

Encrypt by RSA + Invert

Base64 encoded public key is hardcoded
The public key is different in each sample

Inverting encrypted data
Adding junk data at the end (ver.2 or later）
○

Two types of calculation methods for the
size of the junk data were observed:
i. (address of encrypted data + address of
collected data from victim) % 0x50 + 5
ii. (address of encrypted data + returned value of
GetTickCount) % 0x50 + 5

○

Unnecessary data added to the end of data

Add data extracted from encrypted data by
unique algorithm to the end

Japan Security Analyst Conference 2022 - What We Can Do against the Chaotic A41APT Campaign

Jackpot Webshell
●

Webshell malware firstly reported by Trend Micro with
their deep analysis
○

●

It was used as a payload of SigLoader in 2021

Works as a standalone HTTP sever
○

Jackpot receives commands via a POST request for the
specific URL
■

A domain/IP address of victim organization is
hardcoded

○

Jackpot tends to be found at the IIS servers, because
the infected host must be the internet-facing server
■

Even if the IIS service is running, Jackpot works
on the same port

35

Japan Security Analyst Conference 2022 - What We Can Do against the Chaotic A41APT Campaign

Challenge to Know Your Own Organization
Fighting against Opportunistic Compromise, Targeted Deployment
●

The actor attempts to compromise every organizations who seem to be related to their goals,
then the actor will choose (an) organization(s) from among the victims as a start point
○
○

●

Not only HQ, subsidiaries and overseas branches will be affected
Incidents will happen at organizations who don't have enough security controls for internet-facing
systems

Do you have a true understanding of your organization from security perspective?
○

Infrastructure/Security controls of overseas branches, subsidiaries
■
■
■

○
○

Different systems from HQ
Low-budget security controls
Network/System sharing between HQ and subsidiaries

Nothing changed from
2020

Leave maintenance and operation of system SI vendors
Network management, Account management, Endpoint management, etc.
36

Japan Security Analyst Conference 2022 - What We Can Do against the Chaotic A41APT Campaign

Conclusion
●

Chaotic A41APT campaign
○
○
○

●

The campaign is still ongoing and expanding its TTPs
Multiple threat groups seem to be involved
The actor always intruded via Internet-facing systems

Countermeasure should be the same with post-intrusion
ransomware attacks
○

Protect internet-facing systems of whole your company
including branch offices and subsidiaries
■

○
○

●

Cooperate with SI vendors

Detect usage of hacking tools or AD related tools for lateral
movement after establishing C2
Hunt the threats by using EDR, auditing various logs, checking
ASEP

Information sharing like this would be helpful for everyone?
○
○

Difficult to reveal a whole picture of a campaign by a single
vendor
Organizing information can preserve the anonymity of victims
