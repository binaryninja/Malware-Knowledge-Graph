Avast has released a decryptor for the HermeticRansom ransomware strain used in
targeted attacks against Ukrainian systems over the past ten days.
The decryptor is offered as a free-to-download tool from Avast's website and can help
Ukrainians restore their data quickly and reliably.
The first signs of HermeticRansom's distribution were observed by ESET researchers on
February 23, mere hours before the invasion of Russian troops unfolded in Ukraine.

A weak decoy
The ransomware strain was delivered along with a computer worm named HermeticWizard
and served more as a decoy in wiper attacks rather than a tool to support financial
extortion. Still, its infections have disrupted vital Ukrainian systems.
Crowdstrike was quick to spot a weakness in the cryptographic schema of the GO-written
strain and offered a script to decrypt the files encrypted by HermeticRansom (aka
PartyTicket).
"The ransomware contains implementation errors, making its encryption breakable and
slow. This flaw suggests that the malware author was either inexperienced writing in Go or
invested limited efforts in testing the malware, possibly because the available development
time was limited," explains Crowdstrike in a new blog post released on Tuesday.
As BleepingComputer explained on Twitter, the HermeticRansom contains numerous
politically oriented string names in the ransomware binary, ransom note, and contact emails
(vote2024forjb@protonmail.com and stephanie.jones2024@protonmail.com).

The malware itself has functions/project names that appear to reference the
403ForBiden meme:

HermeticRansom was never meant to serve as a modern ransomware strain that would lay
the ground for double extortion, inflicting financial and reputational damage.

Still a danger
The above doesn't mean that HermeticRansom infections don't impact the targeted
machines.
On the contrary, this strain can still encrypt valuable files outside the Program Files and
Windows folders, using an RSA-2048 key.
The ransom note seen by the victims has a typical form and content, asking them to contact
a ProtonMail address to acquire a decryptor.

New decryptor recovers files
Although Crowdstrike's script is reliable, it's not easy for everyone to use it in this situation.
To make it easier, Avast has released a GUI decryptor that makes it easier to decrypt files
encrypted by HermeticRansom.
Also, the tool offers the option to backup the encrypted files to avoid ending up with
irreversibly corrupted files if something goes wrong with the encryption process.

WOW!!!! It is nice to see a another company that effortly made a decryptor for the
victims of the said ransomware. I just hope that they will make an another one for
other ransomwares like Conti, or even STOP.

They can’t just make them, weakness have to be found or the keys for the big boys eg
revil have to be leaked in order for this to happen.
