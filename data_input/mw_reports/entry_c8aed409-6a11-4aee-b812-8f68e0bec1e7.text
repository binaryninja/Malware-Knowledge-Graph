After installing the service, "CoinGoTradeUpdate.exe" has similar behavior to the updater component for AppleJeus version 4 "Kupay Wallet." On

Similarly, to previous AppleJeus variants, "CoinGoTradeUpdate.exe" collects some basic information from the system as well as a timestamp, and
information in hard-coded format strings. Specifically, the timestamp is placed into a format string “ver=%d&timestamp=%lu” where "ver" is set as
referring to the CoinGoTrade version previously mentioned. This basic information and hard-coded strings are sent via a POST to the C2

The postinstall script is identical in functionality to the postinstall scripts from previous AppleJeus variants and is identical to the AppleJeus variant
