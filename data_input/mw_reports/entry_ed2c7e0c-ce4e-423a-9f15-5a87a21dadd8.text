Telsy Threat Intelligence team has observed a spear-phishing campaign conducted by cyberespionage group SideCopy against critical government entities in India.
As previously published by 'TALOS Cisco Security Research' also in this campaign, in
addition to the military themes, SideCopy used publications, invitations to submit
documents/proposals and reproduced phishing portals posing as Indian government webmail
to trick victims into divulging their e-mail credentials.
SideCopy‘s delivery infrastructure consists of using compromised websites to deliver
malicious artefacts to specific victims. In this campaign, the portal
'hxxp://assessment.mojochamps.com' was compromised, the WebShell named 'WSO
version 4.2.5' was uploaded, and the infection chain began to spread.
The infection chain for Windows systems has remained relatively consistent with minor
variations, but unlike previous observations an infection chain for *nix systems has been
introduced. SideCopy continued to send spear-phishing e-mails with malicious file
attachments ranging from WEB links to LNKs that installed remote access trojans (RATs) on
infected systems.
In addition, SideCopy used the BackNet agent in some infection chains. BackNet is a
Python Remote Access Tool. It is made of two main programs:

– A Command and Control server, which is a Web interface to administer the agents
– An agent program, which is run on the compromised host, and ensures communication
with the Command and Control.
The agent can be compiled to native executables using pyinstaller and is therefore
compatible with both Windows and *nix operating systems.
The portal 'hxxp://assessment.mojochamps.com', compromised by the threat actor, had
malconfigured open directories that allowed access to directories and files saved by the
cyber-espionage group.
The analysis of the files on the compromised website made it possible to draw up a timeline
of the activities conducted by the SideCopy group. Between the upload of the first WebShell
and the last reported activity, which appears to be the creation of the Indian government’s
webmail phishing page, there were various activities such as uploading PHP and ELF files
along with decoy documents.
The following storyline omits the decoy documents upload.

Depending on the context and modus operandi, all PHP and other files are consistent with
each other, which makes it possible that the compromised site was used by the same threat
actor to target only India.
Typically, the purpose of the PHP pages was to record the source IP and user agent of the
visitor in a text file and then redirect the user to the malicious file or a decoy file depending
on the purpose of the page.

Map of visitors’ IPs
Analysis of the log files generated by the PHP pages was able to identify around 400 unique
IPs, most of which were concentrated in India. Some of these IPs were attributed to Indian
governmental and civil organisations by analysing the information contained in the Whois
registry databases. For example:
– M.P. Power Management Company Limited
– Power System Operation Corporation Limited
– Inspector General of Police
– Chief of Naval Staff
– National Remote Sensing Agency.
