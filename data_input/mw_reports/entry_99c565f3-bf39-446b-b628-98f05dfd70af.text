Goznym Indictments – action following on from
successful Avalanche Operations

May 16, 2019
We have previously reported on multiple phases of the operations against the Avalanche
platform, in late November 2016, 2017 and 2018. To recap: Avalanche was a long running
criminal malware delivery platform that was used to provide difficult to disrupt, fast flux botnet
command and control (C2) capabilities, to over 20 different malware strains. During the past
3 years, the Shadowserver Foundation has been supporting multiple international Law
Enforcement Agencies in helping to keep roughly 2 million unique IP addresses of the
victims of one or more of these strains protected from cybercrime every day, through court
ordered and voluntary sinkholing of malicious C2 domains and victims remediation via our
free daily network reporting,
As part of ongoing investigations into the operators and customers of the Avalanche
platform, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI),
together with Europol, Eurojust and many Law Enforcement partners in Germany, Georgia,
Ukraine, Moldova and Bulgaria, today announced a significant new case development. The
malware known as Goznym was one of the malware strains being controlled through the
Avalanche platform at the time of the takedown. The Pittsburgh FBI Field Office and LE
partners have now reached a point in their investigation into Goznym where they can reveal
their work to the world. The Goznym malware and the criminal actors behind it were
allegedly responsible for over 41,000 infected computers used in $100 million USD of
attempted fraud. So far 10 suspects have been indicted, with 5 arrested internationally and 5
still at large.

crimes here, as well as a map showing the location of the indicted defendants. The
defendants join the FBI’s wanted list. You can view the full DoJ indictment here
The graph below shows the number of unique IP addresses connecting each day to the
Avalanche sinkhole for active Goznym infections:

We often find that major cybercrime investigations require effective collaboration and
partnerships on a truly international scale. Whilst the Internet spans international borders as
if they were irrelevant, Law Enforcement Agencies still have to work within nation-state legal
frameworks. These factors provide considerable logistical and legal challenges. So
congratulations to all involved in this case for using all of the available tools to best effect. No
one should underestimate the scale of the achievement here.
We can’t say it any better than the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office Special Agent in Charge –
Robert Jones: “Successful investigation and prosecution is only possible by sharing
intelligence, credit and responsibility. Our adversaries know that we are weakest along the
seams and this case is a fantastic example of what we can accomplish collectively.” We
salute the work in this case and we’re happy to have been able to support this investigation.
In turn, we would also like to thank all those who support the work of the The Shadowserver
Foundation. Your continued support means we can quietly provide Law Enforcement with
impartial, free specialist advice and assistance to help them achieve these major successes
and reduce the exposure to risk faced by Internet users.
