AbereBot Returns as Escobar
blog.cyble.com/2022/03/10/aberebot-returns-as-escobar/
March 10, 2022

During Cyble’s routine Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) research, we came across a Twitter post
wherein researchers mentioned a malware that has a name and icon similar to the legitimate anti-virus
app, McAfee. While analyzing the malware we observed that the package name of the malicious app was
com.escobar.pablo. Further research helped us identify this malware as a new variant of the popular
banking Trojan, Aberebot. Besides stealing sensitive information such as login credentials using phishing
overlays, Aberebot has also targeted customers of 140+ banks and financial institutions across 18
countries.
Cyble Research Labs has identified new features in this Aberebot variant, such as stealing data from
Google Authenticator and taking the control of compromised device screens using VNC, etc. Threat
Actors (TAs) have named the new variant as Escobar and published the feature details of the variant in a
cybercrime forum, as shown in the figure below.

Source Code Review
Our static analysis indicated that the malware steals sensitive data such as Contacts, SMSes, Call logs,
and device location. Besides recording calls and audio, the malware also deletes files, sends SMSes,
makes calls, and takes pictures using the camera, etc., based on the commands received from the C&C
server.
The code snippet shown below is used by the malware to access the contacts data such as phone
numbers and email addresses from the victim’s device, as shown in Figure 5.

The malware can take pictures and also has the code to send text SMSes to a specific phone number or
to all the contacts saved in the victim’s device without the user’s knowledge. Refer to figure 13 for the
code used by the malware for this purpose.

Conclusion
Banking threats are increasing with every passing day and growing in sophistication. Escobar is one such
example. The newly added features in the Escobar malware allow the malicious app to steal information
from the compromised device. According to our research, these types of malware are only distributed via
sources other than Google Play Store. As a result, practicing cyber hygiene across mobile devices and
online banking applications is a good way to prevent this malware from compromising your system.

Our Recommendations
We have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against
attackers. We recommend that our readers follow the best practices given below:

How to prevent malware infection?
Download and install software only from official app stores like Google Play Store or the iOS App
Store.
Use a reputed anti-virus and internet security software package on your connected devices, such as
PCs, laptops, and mobile devices.
Use strong passwords and enforce multi-factor authentication wherever possible.
Enable biometric security features such as fingerprint or facial recognition for unlocking the mobile
device where possible.
Be wary of opening any links received via SMS or emails delivered to your phone.
Ensure that Google Play Protect is enabled on Android devices.
Be careful while enabling any permissions.
Keep your devices, operating systems, and applications updated.

How to identify whether you are infected?
Regularly check the Mobile/Wi-Fi data usage of applications installed in mobile devices.
Keep an eye on the alerts provided by Anti-viruses and Android OS and take necessary actions
accordingly.

What to do when you are infected?
Disable Wi-Fi/Mobile data and remove SIM card – as in some cases, the malware can re-enable the
Mobile Data.
Perform a factory reset.
9/10

Remove the application in case a factory reset is not possible.
Take a backup of personal media Files (excluding mobile applications) and perform a device reset.

What to do in case of any fraudulent transaction?
In case of a fraudulent transaction, immediately report it to the concerned bank.

What should banks do to protect their customers?
Banks and other financial entities should educate customers on safeguarding themselves from
malware attacks via telephone, SMSes, or emails.
