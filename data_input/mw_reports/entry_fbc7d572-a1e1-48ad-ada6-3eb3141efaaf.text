December 2, 2021

Update [5/9/2022]: In line with the recently announced expansion into a new service
category called Microsoft Security Experts, we’re introducing the availability of Microsoft
Defender Experts for Hunting for public preview. Defender Experts for Hunting is for
customers who have a robust security operations center but want Microsoft to help them
proactively hunt for threats across Microsoft Defender data, including endpoints, Office 365,
cloud applications, and identity.
Today’s threat landscape is incredibly fast-paced. New campaigns surface all the time, and
the amount of damage that they can cause is not always immediately apparent. Security
operations centers (SOCs) must be equipped with the tools and insight to identify and
resolve potentially high-impact threats before attackers set up persistence mechanisms,
exfiltrate data, or deploy payloads such as ransomware.
Every day at Microsoft, threat hunters work alongside advanced systems to analyze billions
of signals, looking for threats that might affect customers. Due to the sheer volume of data,
we’re meticulous about surfacing threats that customers need to be notified about as quickly
and accurately as possible. This helps ensure that customers can respond to the most
critical threats in their environments through our products and services, such as Microsoft
Threat Experts, a managed threat hunting service that provides expert-level monitoring and
1/8

analysis. With Microsoft Threat Experts, customers get Targeted Attack Notifications, which
are designed to identify the most important risks and provide technical information, as well as
hunting and mitigation guidance. Customers can also consult with our analysts through
Experts on Demand.
Microsoft Threat Experts allows organizations to collaborate with Microsoft analysts to
benefit from their expertise in tackling critical incidents. This collaborative relationship also
gives Microsoft analysts the opportunity to gain invaluable insight into real-world threats, how
attackers operate inside enterprise networks, and how security operations teams function.
This creates an environment conducive to mutual learning and innovation, which helps
improve our processes, protections, and services.
One way we support this close collaboration with customers is through a structured approach
to threat hunting. Human analysts are augmented by AI in the search for potential threats to
our customers. AI helps our human analysts tease out which events in our data require
closer examination. Humans drive the initial hunt, then validate the AI’s findings, and provide
deeper analysis and context for each potential threat. By combining what humans and AI are
each individually good at, we’re able to process data at speed and scale. The process
ultimately decides which potential threats to address first.
Our strategy is designed to evaluate impact and escalate potential threats for investigation,
based on how damaging the potential threat would be if it was found to be valid. Our strategy
is also designed for speed: due to the highly time-sensitive nature of the threat response, our
security analysts need to be confident that the most dangerous potential threats are
analyzed first.
This process starts with Microsoft analysts formulating hypotheses to explain suspicious
behavior discovered within our data. If the hypotheses pass our initial quality checks, we
perform an automated hunt for and collect observations that could ultimately confirm or deny
our suspicions.
Once we’ve gathered more evidence, the observations are grouped into potential threats and
run through a variety of computations to evaluate the possible impact. One of the key figures
we use for evaluating potential threats is the amount of diversity we see across our
observations. A more diverse set of observations indicates that a potential threat is more
likely to have a broad impact.

The computations on the impact of the potential threat are then combined, to calculate a final
priority score. The priority score is used to sort potential threats according to how likely they
are to require urgent attention. Potential threats that are more likely to have a devastating
impact are given higher priority scores, so that they can be addressed more quickly.
Seasoned threat experts investigate and analyze the potential threat once it is ready. If the
threat is found valid, our analysts conduct a deep-dive investigation, gathering the
information our Microsoft Threat Experts customers need to keep themselves safe. They
collect technical details and develop security recommendations. Affected customers are
immediately notified with targeted attack notifications, containing detailed information on
what the threat is, and what they can do to defend themselves. These steps are summarized
in Figure 1.
Our process uses automated hunting and AI to speed up the decision-making, while humans
define the observables, adjust and tune the parameters, perform triage, and craft the
targeted attack notifications sent to affected customers. A deeper look at our process will
show how analysts work closely alongside automation to help protect customers.

Hunting for potential threats
As the first step in our process, threat hunters formulate a hypothesis around data related to
a potential threat, such as, “The attacker remotely executed code by exploiting a vulnerability
in a system process.” After validating the soundness of the hypothesis by measuring the
signal-to noise ratio and using known data sets to ensure that the accuracy is within
acceptable limits, the hypothesis is modeled in our hunting systems, which automatically
perform data collection, correlation, and enrichment.
These automated systems collect observations through our telemetry, from multiple devices
and often from different stages of an attack. Each observation represents a single instance of
a hypothesis – in our example, here is the system process, here is what the system process

3/8

did, and here are the arguments that were passed to it. Examining the observations
associated with the hypothesis helps analysts determine if that instance of the hypothesis is
valid.
Observations are then grouped into potential threats that represent our best current
understanding of a collection of observations. If these observations truly reflect malicious
behavior, the picture they paint is that of an attack on a customer’s computing infrastructure.
Looking at data associated with these observations can help us understand which potential
threats may wreak the most havoc, and prioritize the investigation of more critical threats.

Developing priorities
If a potential threat is malicious, it is more likely to cause critical damage if it involves many
devices inside an organization and is associated with many distinct attack stages. A
confirmed threat that involves a single observation and is confined to an isolated machine is
less likely to have the same level of impact.
Similarly, a potential threat is more likely to have more impact if it involves observations
supporting many different hunting hypotheses. If the potential threat is malicious, a greater
variety of hypotheses reflects a broad-ranging attack that hits many parts of the
organization’s infrastructure in many different ways.
Therefore, a potential threat with more diverse hypotheses is more likely to have a big impact
on our customers, and is prioritized for investigation by Microsoft Threat Experts.

Using diversity to prioritize potential threats
How can we measure the diversity of different aspects of a potential threat? Microsoft Threat
Experts uses entropy, borrowed from information theory. Entropy measures how many bits
(or yes/no questions) it would take, on average, to identify a random element of a set if we
know the elements of the set.

Figure 2. A visual representation of entropy, demonstrating how sets with many distinct
elements have higher entropy than sets with fewer distinct elements.
A set containing elements that are all alike has zero entropy. Meanwhile, a set with more
distinct elements, or the distinct elements in more equal proportions, will have higher entropy.
We use entropy to help decide which potential threats need swift attention, by calculating it
for several attributes that the observations in each potential threat might have. For example,
we calculate the entropy for the hypotheses associated with observations for each potential
threat. We also calculate the entropy for the MITRE techniques associated with the
observations in the potential threat.
After the AI automatically calculates an entropy value for each of these categories, and
values for other factors, such as the severity of the hypothesis for each of the observations
involved, it combines these values together to create an overall priority score for the threat.

Calculating the final priority score
Since our final score takes into consideration many different kinds of information about the
potential threat, we need a way to combine these values. To do this, we convert each the
results of each calculation into a p-value.

5/8

A p-value represents the percentage of potential threats we’d expect to have a certain value
or larger in that category. For example, if only 5% of the MITRE technique entropy values
were larger than the value from our calculation, then the p-value for our potential threat’s
hypothesis entropy would be 0.05.
We do this same p-value conversion using other numbers we’ve generated from the same
potential threat, some based on entropy and others not. We then combine all of these pvalues into a final priority score.

Validating the potential threat
The final prioritization score is used to sort potential threats, so that the most critical potential
threats are analyzed the most quickly. When a potential threat is ready, a dedicated team of
security experts look over the results and perform deep analysis to determine the threat’s
validity.
The analysts closely investigate suspicious activity related to the potential threat, using
information from possibly-affected devices and networks. They search for unexpected events
on the device timeline, indicators of compromise, and other evidence that something
malicious may have occurred.
If the threat is validated and the activity is found to be malicious, our experts set to work to
determine the full scope and protect customers. Related activity surrounding the validated
threat is tracked down, technical details about the systems affected are gathered, and the
team develops security recommendations to defend against the threat.

Microsoft Threat Experts: Helping defenders help themselves
Whenever we discover and validate a critical threat in the environment of a Microsoft Threat
Experts customer, we immediately send out a targeted attack notification. These are special
alerts that provide deep context about the threat, with details specific to each customer’s
unique environment.
Targeted attack notifications aim to help SOCs formulate a response before a critical attack
can wreak havoc on their network. They help highlight the most critical threats, and clearly
identify the ones that need aggressive handling. They also contain key technical details,
which can assist SOCs in swiftly handling an ongoing threat. Customers receive a timeline of
observed events in their organization, as well as advanced hunting queries for surfacing
threat activities. These details can aid in understanding the attack flow and discovering the
scope of the threat.

A case study in prioritization

6/8

Our process can fill the gaps to realize the true scope of a potential threat. Recently, there
was a potential threat involving pre-ransomware activity detected by our machine learning.
Outside of the context provided by Microsoft Threat Experts, it appeared as if this was just
another instance of a widespread Qakbot campaign. It did not initially appear that this threat
was any more dangerous than similar instances of the same campaign.
However, the Microsoft Threat Experts prioritization process had pieced together the
evidence to suggest that the threat could represent one of the most impactful attacks seen
that month. The potential threat was associated with a diverse collection of hunting
hypotheses, as measured by entropy, and thus held a high priority for active investigation by
Microsoft Threat Experts. Since the process evaluated it to be very high priority, Microsoft
Threat Experts quickly assessed the potential threat.
The potential threat was found not only to be valid, but to be every bit as dangerous as
suggested: although the techniques were largely typical of the ongoing Qakbot campaign,
there was an especially swift progression to reconnaissance and credential theft. In addition,
because of the method the attacker used to launch the backdoor, the activity was detected
and alerted on, but not fully remediated.

Figure 3. The flow of a more typical Qakbot infection. In this atypical case, human operators
began late stage, hands-on-keyboard reconnaissance soon after initial entry.
This sort of progression was not normally associated with the flow of an initial entry
campaign, but with human operators attempting lateral movement. The attacker seemed to
be rushing to find out as much as they could, to deal out maximum damage. Furthermore,
Microsoft hunters had identified these same techniques being used in ransomware attacks,
strongly indicating that the operators might soon move to ransom the organization’s devices.
Qakbot has been known to facilitate ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) activity. In the RaaS

7/8

model, a RaaS operator works with affiliates and provides tools for launching ransomware
attacks. The affiliates deploy ransomware payloads by purchasing access to networks with
existing malware infections like Qakbot.
Analysts at Microsoft Threat Experts immediately alerted the organization and provided
advice on how to deal with the validated threat. Security researchers and experts at
Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) and Microsoft Detection and Response Team
(DART) provided further help to prevent the attack from escalating. This aided the defenders
at the targeted organization as they moved to remediate the threat. The collaboration
between Microsoft and the targeted organization ultimately succeeded in stopping the attack.
In spite of the attackers achieving broad lateral movement across the organization and
nearly achieving their objective, the organization was not ransomed and were able to
recover.

Empower your organization
In this example, and many others, notifications from Microsoft Threat Experts can be
invaluable to decreasing the damage threats pose to organizations. Thoroughly warned of
the threat at hand, organizations can take immediate action to remediate the threat using
information from the notification, and perform further analysis with the suite of investigation
tools available through Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
Targeted attack notifications aren’t the only kind of assistance available through Microsoft
Threat Experts. Organizations can also send inquiries to our analysts, through purchasing
Experts on Demand. By consulting with analysts through Experts on Demand, customers
can get more context on an alert, gain clarity on the root cause of an incident, or receive
personalized guidance on how to protect their organization.
Through Microsoft Threat Experts, SOCs are empowered to act quickly and decisively. Learn
how your organization can get expert level monitoring and analysis through Microsoft Threat
Experts.
