CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS | CHINA

Recorded Future analyzed data from the Recorded Future® Platform, social media
sites, local and regional news sites, academic studies, information security reporting,
and other open sources (OSINT) for updates on Chinese state-sponsored influence
operations targeting the 2020 Taiwanese presidential elections and Hong Kong protests.
This report covers topics and information from September 21, 2019 through March 20,
2020 and will be of most value to government departments, geopolitical scholars and
researchers, and all users of social media.

Executive Summary
As outlined by previous Insikt Group research, Chinese influence
operations often aim to present a positive, benign, and cooperative
image of China to foreign audiences. However, we have discovered
that there is a more aggressive and coercive side of Chinese
influence operations when it comes to the targeting of Taiwan
and Hong Kong, regions that China has long viewed as domestic
territory.
This research focuses on emerging tactics, techniques, and
procedures (TTPs) that Chinese state-affiliated or state-friendly
actors have deployed in campaigns targeting the 2020 Taiwan
presidential election and the 2019-2020 Hong Kong protests. In the
context of Taiwan, we observed Chinese state-affiliated activities
stealthily targeting every segment of the influence operations
lifecycle, from production and amplification to dissemination. With
respect to the 2019 Hong Kong protests, we observed new attack
methods, infrastructure, and grassroot groups being deployed in
nontraditional ways to defend and promote Chinese nationalistic
propaganda and state interests.

Key Judgments
• We assess that content farms will continue to play a leading
role in enabling mainland Chinese disinformation efforts
targeting Taiwan.
• Taiwan’s unique efforts to discover, identify, and counter
Chinese state-sponsored influence operations will likely
force Chinese influencers to innovate and use more covert
operational TTPs. We believe that these new tactics will likely
include recruitment of overseas Chinese nationals, co-option
of Taiwanese content farms and social media influencers, use
of cover organizations, procurement of aged social media
accounts, and more.

• We assess that Chinese influence operators will likely employ
artificial intelligence (AI) and bulk social media management
software to ease the propagation of weaponized content at
scale, especially on closed messaging platforms such as LINE
or WhatsApp. Western social media platforms will also be
likely targets for such automated campaigns during sensitive
periods such as elections and global events, on issues that are
relevant to China’s national image and state interests.
• We judge that China will seek to identify local collaborators in
Taiwan and Hong Kong, or those with policy or political views
sympathetic to China, such as public figures, politicians, and
marketing firms, to obfuscate China as the information source
and increase its perceived authenticity.
• We assess that new TTPs used to target Hong Kong protesters
— crowd-sourced doxxing of anti-government protesters and
social media “rallies” to support Chinese state interests — are
likely to become regularly deployed tools in Chinese domestic
and overseas influence operations.
• We assess that the Chinese government is likely to start
leveraging the existing patriotism and capabilities of online
grassroot groups to promote and defend state interests
abroad through explicit direction and implicit nudging.

Background
Taiwan and Hong Kong have long been geopolitical flashpoints for
the mainland Chinese government, which has struggled to build
and maintain a legitimate standing with the people of these two
special-status “regions,” both of which Beijing views as its sovereign
territory and key elements of overall domestic stability.
From a tactical standpoint, the mainland Chinese government views
both Taiwan and Hong Kong as domestic information space. As a
result, it is not unusual to observe active Chinese intelligence and
influence tactics in use that have not been traditionally employed
in other foreign spaces.

In this research, Insikt Group focuses on new TTPs that have been
used to target the most important political events in Taiwan and
Hong Kong this past year — namely, the 2020 Taiwan presidential
elections, which were held on January 11, 2020, and the series of
large-scale Hong Kong protests that started in June 2019 in reaction
to the 2019 Hong Kong Extradition Bill. The data sets we used were
from September 21, 2019 through March 20, 2020 for the Hong
Kong protests, and from October 1, 2019 through January 22, 2020
for the Taiwanese elections.

Taiwan’s 2020 Presidential Elections
Recorded Future observed a spike in references to “disinformation,”
“fake news,” and “influence operations” in the context of Taiwan
between October 2019 and January 2020. In the first half of
January alone, our analysts observed 1,223 references, compared
with the 775 references observed in December 2019, with peak
volume immediately following the Taiwanese presidential elections
on January 11, 2020, in which incumbent president Tsai Ing-wen
successfully won a second term.
Despite the conclusion of the 2020 Taiwanese election cycle and the
subsequent drop in references to disinformation campaigns and
fake news targeting Taiwan, Recorded Future assesses it is highly
likely that Chinese influence operations aimed at dividing Taiwanese
society and promoting pro-China narratives and political candidates
persist. Beijing has adopted this approach toward Taiwan since
President Tsai of Taiwan’s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) 1 first
unseated the pro-China Kuomintang (KMT, the Chinese Nationalist
Party) in 2016.
However, it is important to note that different parties in Taiwan
also engage in online campaigns to sway public opinion to their
respective interests, some of which are aligned with Chinese
Communist Party (CCP) interests and employ similar TTPs. This
convergence in interests, policy goals, and TTPs occasionally
presents difficulties in distinguishing between Chinese (mainland)
interference activity and Taiwanese political activity. We distinguish
between the two types of activities to the best of our knowledge in
the following analysis.
The DPP is one of two major political parties in Taiwan, and has been traditionally
associated with promoting human rights, anti-communism, a distinct Taiwanese identity,
and Taiwan’s sovereignty.

Covert Influence
This section describes TTPs used by Chinese covert influence
operators to target Taiwanese users across Facebook, the popular
messaging app LINE, and YouTube. We also assess the role and
impact of Chinese content farms in the disinformation supply chain
targeting Taiwan, and highlight associated TTPs:
• Content Farms: Publishing fake news stories in English, AIgenerated content, and China-friendly Taiwanese content
farms
• Facebook: Employment of PR firms for Facebook influence
operations, recruitment of Taiwanese influencers, and the use
of Chinese software for monitoring and batch posting
• LINE: Use of Chinese software for monitoring and batch
posting
• YouTube: Use of Chinese influencers to shape narratives on
Taiwanese affairs, and the recruitment of Taiwanese YouTube
influencers
Content Farms
Chinese and Taiwanese content farms 2 have become one of the
biggest sources for misleading, intentionally biased, and false
content in Taiwan. According to the database of Taiwanese
fact-checking website MyGoPen (which translates to “don’t lie”
in Taiwanese), at least 60% of false or misleading information
forwarded to the site are from foreign sources, the majority of
which are from mainland China. Oftentimes, Taiwanese content
farms also source content from Chinese sources, including Chinese
content farms, Weibo posts, WeChat posts, and Chinese state media
or state-affiliated platforms.

We make a distinction between Chinese-originated and Taiwanese-originated content
farms. Either may propagate material in simplified or traditional Chinese, or in any
number of dialects, so the key factor in our determination is who the owners and/or
operators are.

Aside from common tactics to generate internet traffic from
Taiwanese users, such as crafting sensational titles for news articles
copied from local news outlets, Taiwanese researcher Puma Shen
has observed an evolution of tactics, with Chinese operators
creating English-language content farms. In these content farms,
English articles are first translated to written simplified Chinese and
then to traditional Chinese (the official written characters of Hong
Kong and Taiwan, rather than the simplified Chinese characters
used by mainland Chinese) before being disseminated to Taiwanese
users. We believe this evolution is likely for the purpose of deceiving
the growing pool of Taiwanese internet users who have learned to
verify news sources.
While we have not observed instances of content from Englishlanguage content farms being disseminated to Western audiences,
we assess that such infrastructure and English-language content
creation capabilities could be leveraged to target Western audiences.
Another emerging tactic used by both Chinese and Taiwanese content
farms is the use of AI to generate massive volumes of content. In a May
2019 report on how to combat disinformation, Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs
Council — the agency responsible for China policy — speculated that
China had been using AI technology in influence operations targeting
Taiwan. This speculation was corroborated by Taiwanese online
marketer and renowned public opinion manipulator Peng Kuan Chin (彭
冠今). Peng created a “Content Farm Automatic Collection System” that
crawls the internet for Chinese articles and posts and reorganizes the
words and sentences into new text, generating thousands of articles
per day. Peng’s software is modeled on automation software he saw
in China, which he believes no one else outside the mainland has.
Additionally, while Recorded Future has not observed evidence of
Chinese manipulation of Taiwanese content farms, we assess that
operators of popular Taiwanese content farms are likely to be seen
as valuable assets for Chinese influence operations. One example is
Lin Cheng Kuo (林正國), the owner and active contributor to one of
Taiwan’s most popular content farms, Mission (密訊).3 Mission is one of
the most shared sources on Facebook Taiwan (zh-tw.facebook[.]com),
at times surpassing major local news outlets. Investigative news outlet
The original Mission domain was mission-tw[.]com, but it has frequently changed
domains to circumvent Facebook filters since being tagged as a content farm and banned
from Facebook’s News Feed in October 2019.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS | CHINA

The Reporter recently revealed that Lin Cheng Kuo is an active member
of Taiwan’s New Party, which supports unification with Mainland China.
Additionally, he has been photographed attending events held by
China’s provincial-level state-owned news station Hai Xia Dao Bao (
海峡导报), alongside Chinese media personalities. We assess that,
because popular Taiwanese content farms are so vital to spreading
information to the Taiwanese public, owners and operators are likely
to be seen as potential assets for Chinese influence operators.
Facebook
Social media penetration in Taiwan is the highest in Asia, with 89%
of the population using social media at least once per day. Facebook
is one of the most popular social media outlets in Taiwan, with 89%
of Taiwanese internet users reported to use the platform. Facebook
has become a prime target for Chinese influence operations in
Taiwan, probably because of its wide reach and product stickiness.
According to Taiwanese researcher Puma Shen, many content farms
have relied on Facebook “fan” pages to spread disinformation.
However, many of these pages were banned or deleted in 2019, so
content farmers have resorted to employing freelance individuals
in Malaysia, or other overseas Chinese nationals, to disseminate the
content farm’s misleading content across Facebook. We assess that
this trend toward employing more covert means of disseminating
disinformation via local third parties on Facebook will accelerate as
Facebook tightens enforcement of its content policies.
In the first half of 2019, multiple owners of popular Taiwanese
Facebook fan pages disclosed screenshots of strangers attempting
to purchase their fan pages. While speculation is rife on social
and traditional media that the purchasers are mainland Chinese
citizens, these attempts have not been directly attributed to Chinese
nationals. However, according to the testimony of the owner of a
Taiwanese online marketing firm that specializes in PTT4 influence
campaigns, other marketing firms in the industry are conducting
Facebook influence campaigns on behalf of the CCP, mostly through
disseminating images and short commentaries criticizing the
current administration.

Additionally, we have identified Chinese provincial governments
recruiting “mainland-friendly, pro-unification” Taiwanese
influencers through Facebook posts, with the aim of “training a
group of Taiwanese influencers with distinct political affiliations.”
The listings are often posted on behalf of the Chinese government
agencies by Taiwanese locals, with one listing offering a base salary
of ¥5,000 to ¥10,000 RMB (approximately $730 to $1,460 USD).

LINE
LINE is the most popular messaging app in Taiwan, with 21 million
users (about 90% of Taiwan’s population). According to research
revealed by LINE in October 2019, Taiwanese users are unique in
their love of using the “share” feature, which allows users to forward
text, image, or video messages to other users and message groups
within LINE. The share feature is used approximately a hundred
million times per month by Taiwanese users, which is 40% of the
total “shares” globally. This feature operates similarly to the “share”
feature in WhatsApp, which is widely used by Indian nationals
and has facilitated the mass dissemination of disinformation in
India. We assess that the speed and breadth of sharing on LINE
may render Taiwanese users particularly susceptible to Chinese
influence operations.
Chinese operators may also benefit from social media management
technologies, including a Chinese-developed software called “CrossBorder Cloud/Mass Management System” (跨境云/群控系统), which
allows users to batch manage thousands of social media accounts
at once (including Facebook, Instagram, WeChat, WhatsApp, LINE,
QQ, and TikTok). The software allows users to breach the Great
Firewall, change their IP addresses, batch create and translate
posts (including converting written simplified Chinese content to
traditional Chinese), batch manage groups, batch “like” and “share”
posts, and more.
At this time, links between this software and mainland Chinese
influence operations targeting Taiwan remain speculative and
unsubstantiated; however, we believe that these technologies are
likely currently being employed. That is because these technologies
can ease the spread of weaponized content at scale, especially on
closed messaging platforms such as LINE, where Taiwanese users
frequently reshare content.

YouTube
YouTube is also one of the most popular social media platforms in
Taiwan, with 90% of Taiwanese internet users using the platform
and 70% of those users visiting every day.
Researchers have observed that Chinese influence activity on
YouTube has increased in 2019. 10 YouTube channels were created
between August and October 2019 that all focused on attacking
the administration of President Tsai Ing-wen. These researchers
believe that some of the channels, which have more than 10,000
subscribers, are likely content farms run by Chinese nationals.

One example is the YouTube channel “Xida speaks on Taiwan at the
foot of Yushan” (Yushan is the tallest mountain in Taiwan), which
features China National Radio journalist and show host Zhang Xida
(张希达). On the channel, Zhang attempts to speak Mandarin with
a Taiwanese accent and comments on Taiwanese politics, mostly
attacking the country’s ruling DPP administration. China National
Radio is the national radio station of China, and is under the purview
of the Central Publicity Department of the CCP and the State Council
of the People’s Republic of China. The videos on the channel feature
subtitles and graphics in traditional Chinese characters, which we
assess is because the channel is highly likely to be targeting a
Taiwanese audience. 15 videos were posted between August 23
and October 18, 2019, although the channel itself was created on
August 3, 2014. At the time of this writing, the channel had 638,000
subscribers.

Influence operations researcher Puma Shen has also observed
advertisements listed by organizations affiliated with the United
Front Work Department of the CCP (the agency responsible for
coordinating influence operations to neutralize opposition to the
CCP) recruiting Taiwanese YouTube influencers.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS | CHINA

While none of these observed activities have been attributed directly
to the CCP, Recorded Future assesses that we will see more Chinese
and Taiwanese channels on YouTube promoting issues and political
stances that are in the Chinese national interest in the few years
leading up to the next Taiwanese presidential election.
Overt Influence
Between October 1, 2019 and January 22, 2020, Recorded Future
observed 801 references to Taiwan, “Tsai Ing-wen,” and “Han Kuoyu” (the KMT presidential candidate) from the social media accounts
of Chinese state-owned and state-affiliated media. Consistent with
the roles of state media as mouthpieces of the CCP, messaging from
these accounts falls into several major themes that are aligned with
China’s overall “carrot and stick” strategy towards Taiwan: criticism
of the DPP administration and their policies, threats to deter
Taiwanese independence or any deviation from the “One China”
policy, and promotion of economic and cultural opportunities that
come with closer cross-strait ties.
In terms of emerging trends in overt influence by state media, we
believe that two factors will be key in the coming years: first, the
increased targeting of the younger generation of Taiwanese internet
users, and second, the state media’s leveraging and amplification
of false or biased content from social media and content farms.
Increased Targeting of Taiwanese Youth
Recorded Future observed a steady rise of references to Taiwanese
“youth” and “young people” from the same set of accounts over the
past five years, with a spike in references in the past year, peaking
right before the January 2020 Taiwan elections. Most references
centered around career opportunities and testimonies offered by
young Taiwanese that have found success in mainland China.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS | CHINA

Immediately following the January 2020 re-election of President
Tsai, PRC state media Xinhua News Agency published a statement
on social media made by Taiwan Affairs Office spokesperson Ma
Xiaoguang, stating that “[...] young people on both sides of the
strait should communicate more and more. We will never give up
on the Taiwanese young people. We will continue to introduce a
series of policies through continuous exchanges. The measures
will create conditions for cross-strait youth to increase mutual
understanding, improve the correct understanding of cross-strait
relations, and promote a more objective and correct understanding
of the mainland.”
While these posts account for a small subset of the posts mentioning
Taiwan, we assess that this may indicate that the Chinese state has
realized the deciding role that the younger generation of Taiwanese
voters is increasingly playing in public opinion and elections.

Leveraging and Amplifying Social Media and Content Farms
Not only do both Taiwanese and Chinese content farms copy
content originating from Chinese state media, but investigations
have also shown that state media reference and amplify fake or
biased content that originates from social media and content farms.
Examples include the 2018 Banana Crisis, during which Xinhua News
referenced “Taiwanese public opinion,” saying that “deteriorating
relations with mainland China brought on by the current
administration” was one of the main drivers of plunging banana
prices. The Xinhua article was further shared by Chinese content
farms including KKNews. Investigative news outlet The Reporter
later discovered that the false information had originated from the
Taiwanese content farm Mission and morphed as it was shared and
copied between anti-DPP Facebook groups and different content
farms. A false news story smearing President Tsai published by the
Global Times had followed a similar creation and dissemination
process and been shared by numerous content farms.

Hong Kong Protests
Between September 21, 2019 and March 20, 2020, Recorded Future
observed approximately 230,000 references to Hong Kong protests,
an 11.9% drop from the approximately 261,000 references observed
in the prior six months (March 21 to September 20, 2019). However,
it is worth noting that the first mentions appeared in June 2019, when
the protests started. Of the 228,000 references, 692 mentions were
related to “disinformation,” “fake news,” or “influence operations.”
Much of the reporting was focused on influence operations — some
attributed to the Chinese government — carried out on social media
(such as Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube), which Recorded Future
assesses will continue to be a common TTP employed by Chinese
state-sponsored groups.

Recorded Future ® | www.recordedfuture.com | CTA-CH-2020-0429 | 13

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS | CHINA

We highlight two new TTPs observed in the past six months that
have been employed by Chinese state-backed groups or groups
that are supportive of the state: first, the crowd-sourced doxxing
of anti-government protesters, and second, social media “rallies” to
support Hong Kong police and authorities, and the Chinese state.
Recorded Future assesses that these are likely to become regularly
deployed tools in Chinese influence operations due to the general
rise of Chinese grassroot patriotism and national pride that are the
driving forces behind these campaigns.
Crowd-Sourced Doxxing of Protestors
Since August 2019, Recorded Future has observed multiple websites
and Telegram channels or groups created for the purpose of “doxxing”
anti-government protesters, publicly revealing their PII and possibly
exposing them to cyberbullying or other malicious targeting. These
websites collect submissions of doxxing information via an official
contact email and publish doxxed profiles in well-designed, uniform
templates without revealing their sources. In this report, we focus
on two of the biggest doxxing websites: HKLeaks and Hong Kong
Mob.

HKLeaks is the most prominent and widely reported doxxing site
targeting anti-government protesters. It has been referenced by
Chinese state media and foreign news outlets alike. The site has
used at least 12 known top-level domains (full list in Appendix A)
since its creation, likely to avoid takedown requests by Hong Kong
authorities, as it is illegal to disclose certain personal details of an
individual without their consent.

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS | CHINA

HKLeaks includes pages that “debunk (anti-government) rumors,”
list out entities branded as “accomplices of protesters” (including
churches, restaurants, corporations, and schools), and break down
doxxed targets into seven different categories. Doxxed targets
include eight teachers that are seen as supporters of the protests
(such as the principal of the Chinese University of Hong Kong), 61
journalists and editors of Apple Daily (one of Hong Kong’s biggest
newspapers), 23 individuals who allegedly doxxed the Hong Kong
police, numerous pro-democracy lawmakers and opinion leaders,
and more than 900 protesters. A doxxed profile would include a
headshot and information such as the individual’s full name, current
occupation, date of birth, telephone numbers, Facebook accounts,
address, and a brief description of their “misdeeds.”
According to data from social media monitoring platform
CrowdTangle, as of November 2019, more than two million people
follow Facebook pages that have shared HKLeaks’s posts. HKLeaks is
also promoted by Twitter accounts, Telegram groups and channels,
and Weibo accounts.
The doxxing has real-life consequences for some of the victims — a
female reporter from Apple Daily, for instance, received hundreds
of threatening calls. Anecdotal evidence presented by some of the
victims allege that authorities from mainland China may be involved.
A victim told AFP that he gave a “fake address I’ve never given to
anyone” to Chinese police while he was questioned at the border
when returning to Hong Kong from a business trip in mainland
China in August, which showed up as his address on HKLeaks.
Another victim told Apple Daily that his photo on the website was
the photo he used on his China travel card.
While we are unable to attribute the creation and management
of the site to an individual or group of individuals, we assess that
HKLeaks is almost certainly the result of a highly coordinated effort
and heavy resource investment.
• The continuous curation of doxxing information and
production of customized, professional-quality graphics over a
period of months show a sustained resource investment.

• The constant shift of domains, the use of bulletproof hosting,
and the use of anonymous registration indicate an intent to
evade takedown and prosecution. A prominent message on
the top of the homepage reads, “We declare that this site will
never shut down!”
• HKLeaks has been promoted on social media by accounts
similar to those taken down by platforms for coordinated
inauthentic behavior linked to state-backed actors. Some
social media accounts were created shortly before the website
was created in August 2019; others were old, idle accounts
that were revived around the same time.

Hong Kong Mob is a doxxing site that provides cash rewards to
people who provide either new doxxing targets or information on
existing targets. Individuals can submit new doxxing targets via
the official contact email address, and can provide information of
existing targets through an online form on the website.
Information requested includes Facebook and other social media
accounts, and the misdeeds of the target. The first person to
provide “useful information” will receive the reward; if multiple
people provide useful information, the cash reward would be split
among the individuals. The website accepts donations for its cash
reward fund.
While Hong Kong Mob is no longer active, the most recent capture
from WayBack Machine on January 14, 2020 shows a banner on the
homepage stating that 62 protesters have been doxxed, 46 doxxing
targets are outstanding, and 78,019 HKD (approximately $10,048
USD) worth of cash rewards have been awarded.
Hong Kong Mob also includes a page that lists out links to similar
pro-Hong Kong government and anti-protester websites, Telegram
groups and channels, and Facebook groups and pages.
According to its “About Us” page, the website was created by two
groups: “Global Volunteers Against Hong Kong’s Pro-Independence
Mob” (全球反港獨暴徒志願者聯盟), and “Volunteers to Protect Hong
Kong” (守護香港志願者聯盟). Recorded Future is unable to attribute
these two groups, nor are we able to confirm that they are indeed
two separate groups. However, we assess that the actors behind
Hong Kong Mobs are likely not Hong Kong natives, but are attempting
to pass off as such. Although most of the website is written in
traditional Chinese characters (rather than the simplified Chinese
characters used by mainland Chinese) and the content mirrors
written and spoken Cantonese (which uses distinct characters and
wording that is different from the written Chinese of Taiwan and
mainland China), some terms and wording used on the website are
not commonly used by Hong Kong-born Cantonese speakers.

Possible Connections Between Doxxing Websites
Recorded Future has observed similarities between HKLeaks and
Hong Kong Mob:
• Same Hosting Infrastructure: Both sites were hosted by a
Russian bulletproof host service, DDoS-GUARD. Initial domains
were hosted on the same IP address block, with hkleaks[.]org
hosted on 185.178.208[.]149 and hongkongmob[.]com hosted
on 185.178.208[.]143.
• Same Domain for Contact Email: Both contact emails are
hosted by Russian email service provider Yandex.
While these similarities are not sufficient evidence to support a
connection between these two websites, Recorded Future notes that
these similarities are not shared with other doxxing websites such
as jophk[.]com. We assess that the use of Russian hosting services
and email hosts by the websites’ creators are likely to maintain
anonymity and evade takedown or data disclosure requests from
the Hong Kong government or other relevant jurisdictions rather
than attempting to pose as Russian actors.

It is also worth noting that many of these doxxing websites and social
media groups and channels also promote similar anti-protester,
or doxxing, websites and social media channels as resources.
We assess that this is due to the political motivation behind the
creation of these websites and groups, which eliminates the sense
of competition between different websites for online traffic and
exposure, as they are all supporting the same cause.

Interactions With State Media
On September 18, 2019, the official Weibo account of CCTV, China’s
state-owned TV network, published a video showcasing the HKLeaks
website, and urged followers to “act together” and “tear off the masks
of the rioters.” The post was subsequently shared by the Weibo
accounts of local Chinese police, local media outlets, branches of
Chinese Communist Youth League, and others. While this does not
establish a direct connection between doxxing websites such as
HKLeaks and the Chinese state, we believe this endorsement by
state organizations has, at the very least, supported and encouraged
these anti-protester doxxing efforts.

Social Media ‘Rallies’ to Support Hong Kong Police and
Chinese Authorities
China has a history of internet patriotism. The past several years
have yielded several examples of Chinese netizens rallying to
use VPNs to circumvent the Great Chinese Firewall and leave
angry comments on social media accounts of public figures
and brands that have “wronged” China and “hurt the feelings of
Chinese people.” Several online rallies have been observed since
the summer of 2019, targeting Hong Kong pro-democracy social
media pages and accounts. These rallies differ from usual internet
activism from individual Chinese online “patriots,” as they involve
the congregations of individuals which assume a common identity
(other than just patriotism) and often have a fixed start date and
time when participants engage in certain online behavior together.
Rather than one-off actions of individuals, participation in these
rallies is based on and can cultivate a sense of community, rather
similar to attending events in the offline world. We highlight two
netizen groups that have been most active: “Diba” (帝吧) and
“Fangirls” (饭圈女孩).
Diba ‘Expeditions’
One of the more coordinated Chinese netizen groups is Diba, a
forum with more than 30 million followers on China’s largest search
engine Baidu, which has organized at least 10 online “expeditions,”
or “rallies,” since 2005. One of Diba’s recent expeditions was in 2016
after the election of Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen. The group
called upon Chinese netizens to flood prominent Taiwan-related
Facebook pages with anti-Taiwan independence comments to
“show the patriotism of the Chinese youth.” Diba users also rallied
to flood the Facebook pages of the Swedish national broadcaster
SVT and Sweden’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs after SVT ran a satirical
sketch about Chinese tourists in 2018.

On July 22, 2019, Diba organized its first online rally targeting the
Hong Kong protests with the objective to “Support Hong Kong
police, maintain rule of law, denounce violence and chaos, and
sustain ‘one country two systems’.” Netizens flooded two prodemocracy Facebook pages with comments supporting the Hong
Kong police and “One China.” Another rally was planned for the next
evening to show support for a pro-China lawmaker in Hong Kong,
but was abruptly called off due to “Diba management receiving
phone calls from relevant authorities,” as outlined in a post on the
Diba official Weibo account. No concrete explanations were given
but Diba members speculated that the Chinese government may
have intervened.
Fangirl ‘Rallies’
A new group of Chinese netizens that has sprung out of the Hong
Kong protests is called the “fangirls.” In China, “fangirls” used to be
a slightly demeaning reference to fan groups of celebrities, who
have a reputation of pulling crazy stunts to support their “idols”
(爱豆) and often get into fierce online arguments with fans of other
celebrities. The demographic profile of these fan groups are usually
young women born after 1990 (the so-called “post-’90s” generation).
As the entertainment industry in China became more competitive,
these fan groups have professionalized online rallying and showing
support for their celebrities, as these overt expressions of support
serve as an indicator for how popular the celebrities are and boosts
their careers. On August 14, 2019, numerous groups of fangirls
rallied together to show support for a new idol, “Brother China”
(阿中哥哥/阿中), an imaginary personification of the Chinese state.
According to local news reports, fangirls had become upset that their
beloved celebrities were being attacked online and boycotted by
Hong Kong anti-government protesters for speaking out in support
of the Hong Kong police and the Chinese state. As a result, fan
groups that usually supported different celebrities temporarily put
aside their differences and supported the Chinese state. According
to Southern Metropolis Daily, a local newspaper, at least 12 different
fan groups were created to support the personified “Brother China.”
Some fan groups had more than 200 people. Within two days, the
topic “We all have an idol called Brother China” (我们都有一个爱豆名
字叫阿中) was trending on Weibo, and had 790 million views.

The groups were well organized, and had specific teams for image
creation, copywriting, translating, and even technical support. They
also provided tools and manuals, teaching newcomers how to
register for Instagram and Facebook accounts and how to use VPNs.
The fangirls not only flooded the social media accounts of pro-China
celebrities and public figures with supporting comments, they also
flooded Instagram hashtags with pro-China images and memes.
Through comments and images, the fangirls created personas for
the Chinese state as a male celebrity that “has been active for 5,000
years,” “has 1.4 billion fans,” “was born into power and influence,”
but “was bullied by others and lost his status” and had “a son and
a daughter that were kidnapped and now refuse to recognize him
as their father.” These fictional personas of Brother China mirror
the common CCP propaganda narratives, including concepts such
as the “century of humiliation” and fundamental lore about the
Chinese nation.

Interactions Between Diba and Fangirls
On August 16, 2019, Diba launched its own “Expedition of Patriotic
Youths” to support the fangirls’ rally. It also promoted the QQ
messaging group chat accounts of 17 fangirl groups so that Diba
users could join in the ongoing efforts. Diba’s call for online
patriotism amplified the exposure of the fangirls’ online rally, and
was shared by many Weibo opinion leaders, including Hong Kong
pro-China lawmaker Junius Ho.

Interactions With the Chinese State
State media and state-affiliated organizations played an important
role in instigating, encouraging, and promoting the online rallies of
fangirls and Diba.
• The August 14 fangirl rally was in part inspired by a Weibo
post from CCTV’s official account with the title “[Hong Kong
Celebrity] Jackson Wang targeted by pro-democracy forces
for being patriotic and protecting [the Chinese] flag.” The
post warned pro-democracy protesters to “immediately stop
unlawful, violent behavior, or face dire consequences.”

• The fangirl rally was encouraged and promoted by the official
Weibo accounts of People’s Daily, Communist Youth League,
and the Global Times. It was also highlighted on national
television, as a segment of CCTV news.
• The August 17 Diba expedition was encouraged and promoted
by the official Weibo account of the Communist Youth League.
Recorded Future assesses that the online netizen groups Diba and
fangirls are likely grassroot movements that are initiated from
the bottom up rather than being directed by the Chinese state.
However, it is likely that the Chinese government will start leveraging
the existing patriotism and capabilities of these online grassroot
groups to promote and defend state interests abroad through
explicit direction (such as the phone calls to Diba management
by authorities) and implicit nudging (such as encouraging fangirls
rallies).

Emerging Chinese TTPs Targeting Taiwan and
Hong Kong
Based on the analysis of influence operations targeting the 2020
Taiwan presidential elections and 2019-2020 Hong Kong protests,
we have identified the following TTPs employed by Chinese statesponsored actors or actors supportive of the Chinese state since
September 2019.
• Creation of simplified Chinese-, traditional Chinese-, and
English-language influence content for dissemination across
a wide variety of both traditional social media and messaging
applications
• AI-generated content
• Use of social media management software to ease the
propagation of influence messaging
• Co-option of witting and unwitting collaborators, such as
public figures, politicians, and marketing firms, in spreading
Chinese influence information on social media
• Exploitation of the “share” function in LINE to quickly spread
misleading, intentionally biased, or false content before it can
be countered

• Use and creation of YouTube channels propagating
misleading, intentionally biased, or false content designed to
look like commentary from domestic citizens
• Employing state-run media to amplify misleading, intentionally
biased, or false content
• Microtargeting of specific audiences on other Western social
media platforms, such as younger voters in Taiwan
• Crowd-sourced doxxing of anti-government protesters
• Grassroot social media “rallies” to support Chinese state
interests

Outlook
Our research here examining recent Chinese state-run influence
operations reveals that Chinese operational TTPs, targets, and
methodologies continue to evolve.
We assess that these campaigns demonstrate that Chinese influence
operators are willing to adopt more aggressive tactics that exploit
weaknesses in targeted societies or manipulate patriotic sentiments
of their own people.
In particular, Chinese influence operations targeting Hong Kong
and Taiwan have been able to outmaneuver counter-disinformation
efforts in Taiwan and effectively exploit gaps in the terms of service
of several social media platforms. The Chinese state also makes use
of patriotic individuals and grassroot groups who are both proactive
and passionate about their cause, and possess advanced technical
and organizing capabilities to execute and sustain influence
operations over long periods of time. Another key theme that has
surfaced in both the Taiwan and Hong Kong case studies is the role
that Chinese state media organizations play in creating, amplifying,
and supporting various influence operations that might otherwise
not be directly linked to the state.

We expect more of these resources and tactics to be deployed in
overseas influence operations on social media platforms over the
course of the next year. In particular, automated content creation
and dissemination in local languages are likely to be used in
targeting foreign audiences for Chinese state interests, especially
during sensitive times such as elections and global events. An
ongoing example during the current COVID-19 pandemic is the use
of botnets to promote Chinese-friendly content in Serbia.
