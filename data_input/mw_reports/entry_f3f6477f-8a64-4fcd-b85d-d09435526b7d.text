Abstract
ISFB is also known as Gozi2/Ursnif, sometimes Rovnix. ISFB reappeared in early 2013
attracting some attention from the research community and a lot of confusion in the naming
convention and to what was being analyzed. Then suddenly, it went dark again. However,
dark does not mean dead. With attention of the world focused on Dridex and Dyre, ISFB
silently evolved, hiding from the spotlight to become one of the most complex and fully
featured banking trojans out there In this paper, we break the silence surrounding ISFB,
giving a full description of this malware capabilities which are beyond those of the average
banking trojan: 4 ways of communicating with the CC, half a dozen tricks to steal your
money, the ability to create movies of your activity and naturally numerous ways of
manipulating your web traffic.
