Countermeasures that detect malicious Cobalt Strike activity enabled a compromised
organization to mitigate a GOLD LAGOON intrusion before the threat actors deployed
ransomware. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 By: Counter Threat Unit Research Team
Many cybercriminals that operate malware use the ubiquitous Cobalt Strike tool to drop
multiple payloads after profiling a compromised network. Cobalt Strike is a commercially
available and popular command and control (C2) framework used by the security community
1/3

as well as a wide range of threat actors. The robust use of Cobalt Strike lets threat actors
perform intrusions with precision.
Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers conducted a focused investigation
into malicious use of Cobalt Strike to gain insights about when and how the tool has been
used. This knowledge can help to secure organizations that may be targeted by threat actors
with diverse motives.
Understanding a threat actor's end goal is important. For example, the financially motivated
GOLD LAGOON threat group leverages the Qakbot botnet to deploy Cobalt Strike. CTU™
researchers frequently observe GOLD LAGOON deploying Cobalt Strike to Qakbot-infected
hosts that are identified as members of an Active Directory domain. The threat actors then
use Cobalt Strike to move laterally throughout the network, establish persistence, and
ultimately facilitate damaging post-intrusion ransomware attacks. GOLD LAGOON provides
access to other threat groups that deploy various ransomware families in compromised
environments.
The value of early detection is highlighted by two similar incidents. In the first incident,
Secureworks incident responders helped the victim recover from a REvil ransomware attack.
The organization did not have an endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution that
identified the preceding Qakbot and Cobalt Strike activity, which enabled the threat actors to
achieve their objectives. In the second incident, Secureworks Taegis™ XDR
countermeasures detected and alerted on the malicious Qakbot and Cobalt Strike activity in
the environment, enabling network defenders to respond quickly to contain and mitigate the
intrusion before ransomware was deployed.
In this second incident, a user opened an Excel 4.0 macro worksheet attached to a phishing
email. The attachment downloaded and installed Qakbot. Qakbot profiled the infected host,
sent the profiled data to its C2 servers, and then downloaded and executed Cobalt Strike
Beacon. The threat actor used Cobalt Strike Beacon's remote code execution capability to
execute the ping utility. Ping identified additional accessible servers within the network. The
threat actor deployed Cobalt Strike Beacon on those targets and then executed arbitrary
commands on those systems via the Rundll32 execution utility. One of these commands
attempted to discover domain administrator accounts.
This process of deploying Cobalt Strike Beacon to additional servers from a compromised
host lets network defenders detect the service established on the remote host, the admin
share launching content, and the resulting command execution:
By default, Cobalt Strike always leverages the Rundll32 utility for command execution.
Cobalt Strike always launches Rundll32 as a service via the 'ADMIN$' share on the
remote host.
The binary that Cobalt Strike uses to launch Rundll32 via the 'ADMIN$' share always
has a filename that is exactly seven alphanumeric characters.

The threat actor also installed Cobalt Strike PowerShell stagers on servers accessed when
moving laterally through the compromised network. These stagers allowed the Cobalt Strike
Beacon payload to execute in memory. Cobalt Strike PowerShell stager's default execution
pattern is always configured to launch as a service and is invoked from the command line
with the parameters "/b /c start /b /min powershell -nop -w hidden". The stager executes and
decodes a byte sequence in memory to launch Cobalt Strike via a reflected loaded library.

The availability of unauthorized Cobalt Strike versions on the dark web means that threat
actors can abuse it. Network defenders must attempt to answer the "friend or foe" question
when they detect Cobalt Strike in their environment, as the tool can be used for both
legitimate and malicious purposes. Taegis XDR, which is continually updated with
intelligence gained through CTU research, helps organizations differentiate noise, legitimate
use, and actionable alerts. Preview Taegis XDR to explore more coverage for MITRE
