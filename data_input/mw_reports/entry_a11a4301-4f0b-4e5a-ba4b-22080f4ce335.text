SNAKEMACKEREL:
Threat Campaign Likely Targeting NATO
Members, Defense and Military Outlets

Main Topic from Title Page

SUMMARY
This report details iDefense's analysis of a macro-enabled Microsoft Corp. Word document found in
the wild that is likely associated with the SNAKEMACKEREL threat group. iDefense assesses with
moderate confidence that the actors may be targeting attendees and sponsors of the upcoming
Underwater Defence & Security 2019 event occurring March 5-7, 2019, in Southampton, United
Kingdom.1 This event draws attendees from government, military and private sector entities across
the globe, allowing this global event to represent a unique opportunity for SNAKEMACKEREL actors
to conduct targeted intrusion operations against a wide array of organizations falling under its
collection requirements.

OVERALL ANALYSIS
Intended Audience
This Intelligence Alert (IA) is intended to better inform decision makers operating in targeted regions
and verticals; such decisionmakers include security operations center (SOC) and intelligence
analysts, security engineers and senior leadership.

How to Use This Intelligence
This Intelligence Alert (IA) is intended to provide technical information about SNAKEMACKEREL
threat activity to help cybersecurity professionals better understand its threat behavior and help
identify indicators of compromise (IoCs). SOC and intelligence analysts may use the information
provided in this report for hunting activities, such as infrastructure enumeration and malware
analysis. Additionally, security engineers may use this information to create or add to existing
capabilities to detect suspicious network activity that may indicate initial compromise by and lateral
movement of the adversary. Finally, management and executive leadership may use this information
to assess the risk associated with the threat described herein to make operational and policy
decisions. The information and suggested actions in this IA, however, are general in nature and do
not take into account the specific needs of your IT ecosystem and network, which may vary and
require unique action.

How This Intelligence Helps Address Existing or Potential Threats
Understanding SNAKEMACKEREL tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) may help to detect
initial compromise and could prevent the spread of malware, ransomware or other threats
throughout a company's internal network.

Key Assessment and Findings
•

Defense analysts recently discovered a macro-enabled Microsoft Word document that
appears to reference the Underwater Defence & Security 2019 event, which is scheduled to
occur March 5-7, 2019, in Southampton, United Kingdom. The specific venue for the event is
the Ageas Hilton hotel.

•

According to the event website, this is a three-day global event focused on how NATO
members and affiliated nation states can respond to sea-based threats, including what role
manned, unmanned and autonomous systems can be effectively used to conduct dangerous
mission operations.2

•

The document is used to drop a DLL file that is believed to be a version of SedUploader, a
first-stage reconnaissance tool thought to be developed and used by SNAKEMACKEREL
actors.

•

At this time, based on analysis of available malware samples, in addition to the observed TTPs
used by the actors behind this Word document, iDefense has high confidence that this
activity is associated with the SNAKEMACKEREL threat group.

•

This report is intended to provide early indication and warning (I&W) notice to public and
private sector organizations sponsoring or attending this event, as it represents a unique
opportunity for this adversary to conduct targeted attacks against entities aligned with what
appears to be its collection requirements.

MALWARE ANALYSIS
Exhibits 1 and 2 show images of the content within the macro-enabled Microsoft Word document,
which has a filename of “UDS 2019 Current Agenda.doc.”3

The following are the properties of this Word file:
•

MD5: f8a778d21003098075c9aef8ed58c6c3

•

Filename: UDS 2019 Current Agenda.doc

•

File Type: MS Word Document

•

Creation Date Stamp: 2018-12-11 14:17:00 (December 11, 2018, 2:17 p.m.)

•

Last Saved Date Stamp: 2018-12-12 20:30:00 (December 12, 2018, 8:30 p.m.)

Based upon iDefense analysis, it appears that SNAKEMACKEREL actors stole content for the lure
document directly from the following link, which hosts the official conference agenda for 2019:
•

http://www.underwater-defence-security.com/files/agenda13.pdf?version=1.0

The document writes two files, which are identical, shown in Exhibit 3.

Exhibit 3: Macro Code That Drops SedUploader and Illustrates Document's Two Identical Files

This DLL file has the following properties:
•

MD5: ebdc6098c733b23e99daa60e55cf858b

•

Filename: adobe.dll or clnb.dat

•

Compiler/Packer: Borland Delphi 3.0

•

Compilation Date Stamp: 2018-12-07 20:49:45 (December 7, 2018, 8:49:45 p.m.)

The macro-based document then executes the clnb.dat file (which is actually a DLL) using rundll32
and calling the first export. Last, it sets the registry key shown below for persistence; this key will
start adobe.dll with the same export upon system reboot:
•

HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\AdobeAcrobat

Exhibit 4 shows an example of this macro code.

Adobe.dll
This DLL file, which is identical to clnb.dat, is believed to be a variant of the SedUploader malware. It
sends command-and-control (C2) communications to photopoststories[.]com, as shown in Exhibit 5.

Exhibit 5: Example Connection to C2 Server (values redacted)

XOR Encryption
Throughout the execution of this DLL, a method is called that decodes XOR-encoded strings that are
hardcoded into the malware. This code uses the following XOR key, as shown in Exhibits 6 and 7:

Infrastructure Enumeration
Based upon available WhoIs data, SNAKEMACKEREL appears to have created the C2 server
photopoststories[.]com on December 7, 2018. iDefense analysts also observed another domain
(proposalprogram[.]com) hosted on the same IP address (185.86.150.193); this domain was listed as
the aforementioned C2 server for which clients were advised to proactively monitor network activity,
although iDefense did not observe any malicious content being hosted on this site as of December
21, 2018.
The SLL certificate (e979d63a80f96ec06e7308541713d201813927a6) issued for the C2 server also
appears to be new; it was first observed on December 7, 2018.
Exhibit 11 shows more information for this SLL certificate.

GEOPOLITICAL ANALYSIS
The Word document was uploaded to a third-party anti-virus vendor on December 20, 2018, by an
unknown entity likely based in Macedonia. This observation is notable, as Macedonia is currently
pending admission to NATO as its thirtieth member; this admission is expected to become official
sometime in 2020. This activity aligns with prior SNAKEMACKEREL threat activity, as the group
allegedly targeted government officials in Montenegro back in 2017 prior to that country's accession
to NATO.
iDefense analysts note that this event draws attendees from government, military, and private sector
entities across the globe, including those located in the US, Western and Eastern Europe, Middle
East and Asia-Pacific regions. As such, this global event represents a unique opportunity for
SNAKEMACKEREL actors to conduct targeted intrusion operations against a wide array of
organizations falling under what appear to be its collection requirements.
Exhibit 12 provides a brief synopsis of the conference agenda, which appears to emphasize the need
for NATO members and affiliate nation states to improve naval capabilities (e.g. fleets and
submarines) to address increasing global instability.

Exhibit 12: Conference Agenda Synopsis4

This agenda would likely be of high interest to Russian intelligence agencies for several reasons:
It may provide them with detailed information on how NATO members and its allies plan to develop
new underseas capabilities to counter Russia's continued focus on new, stealth classes of
submarines.
It may provide them with detailed information on new technologies that could be reverse
engineered and implemented into their current and future classes of submarines, some of which
have the capability to launch nuclear-powered ballistic missiles.

CONCLUSION
At this time, iDefense has high confidence that this activity is associated with the SNAKEMACKEREL
threat group. iDefense analysts will continue to monitor for new activity related to this global event
and will provide additional updates as necessary.
