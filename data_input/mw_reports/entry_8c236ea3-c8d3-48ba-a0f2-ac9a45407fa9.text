Foreign hackers have breached and stolen information from Russian federal executive
bodies, the Russian government said in a report published last week.
The attacks were identified in 2020.
They were detailed in a joint report authored by Rostelecom-Solar, a cybersecurity division of
Russian telecom giant Rostelecom, and the National Coordination Center for Computer
Incidents (NKTsKI), a CERT-like organization created by the Russian Federal Security
Service (FSB) in 2018.
“Evaluating attackers in terms of training and qualifications (used technologies and
mechanisms, the speed and quality of the work done by them), we are inclined to classify
this group as cyber mercenaries pursuing the interests of a foreign state,” the report
reads.

Attackers used novel malware

To breach Russian federal agencies, Rostelecom and NKTsKI said the attackers used a
broad set of entry vectors that included spear-phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities in web
applications, and hacking the IT infrastructure of government contractors.
“After a complete compromise of the infrastructure, the attackers proceeded to collect
confidential information from all sources of interest: such as mail servers, electronic
document management servers, file servers, and workstations of various levels,” the report
said.
Once they breached a victim, the attackers would deploy two never-before-seen malware
strains named Mail-O and Webdav-O, both stealthy backdoors that the intruders used to
execute commands on infected hosts and steal data.
Both strains exfiltrated data to command and control infrastructure hosted on local Russian
cloud providers, with Mail-O uploading data to Mail.ru Cloud servers and Webdav-O to the
Yandex.Disk cloud.
Both Mail-O and Webdav-O were also designed to bypass Kaspersky antivirus software,
which is usually installed on Russian federal networks, and disguised their network traffic as
legitimate communications for Mail.ru’s Disk-O and the Yandex.Disk applications.
The joint report contains additional technical details about the inner workings of both
malware strains.
Russian authorities did not attribute the attack to any specific country as of yet.
The report comes a month after the US government formally attributed the SolarWinds
supply-chain attack to a cyber-espionage operation carried out by the Russian Foreign
Intelligence Service.
