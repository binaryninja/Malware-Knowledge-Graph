§ Automated Teller Machine
§ Cash disposing & dispensing
§ 2.2 million devices worldwide
§ Different hardware & software vendors

The first ATM was installed in 1939 in
New York City, known as “Bankograph”.
Removed after 6 months because
it was not used J

It was reintroduced in Ohio in 1959,
with huge success.
There are currently more then 2.2
million ATM’s worldwide.

The ATM is a “stupid” device, part of the bank’s overall architecture.
It relies on back-end services for “important” decisions.

Attack failed

Using openly available forensic toolkits we managed to
recover the majority of the original hard disk content.

Sweet... But I don’t have a bank back-end (yet)

The amount is specified
dynamically by a command
line argument

Specify how many notes you
want per cassette

tDispense.lpDenomination= &tDenomination;
HRESULT hResult =
WFSExecute(service,WFS_CMD_CDM_DISPENSE,&tDispense,WFS_INDEFINIT

Load the dispense with the specified
denomination & execute the dispense operation

TODO: Make it generic for different ATM devices
(read custom config from registry J)

Modern ATMs are standard, Windows-based, computers full of money
ATM software is developed according to open standards

Highly interesting target, protection is required!
