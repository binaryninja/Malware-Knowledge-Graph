SECREPAGEORA-
(U) As to the reasons for TRANSCOM’s lack of knowledge regarding these intrusions, :
the committee found gaps in requirements that result in many cyber intrusions not being reported |
to the command and a lack of common understanding between TRANSCOM and its contractors
as to the scope of cyber intrusions that must be reported. The committee also found that FBI and |
Department of Defense (DOD) components were frequently unaware that companies they had
identified as victims of cyber intrusions were TRANSCOM contractors, In addition, the inquiry |
revealed misperceptions about the rules governing how cyber intrusion-related information
identifying a particular victim may be shared and a lack of communication between i
TRANSCOM and other DOD components regarding TRANSCOM’s need to know about cyber
intrusions, In the end, these shortcomings left TRANSCOM uninformed about the
overwhelming majority of cyber intrusions affecting contractor networks by APT actors.
I, The Cyber Threat to Defense Operations |
(U) Foreign governments regularly probe DOD and private contractor computer networks i
to identify vulnerabilities that could allow them to compromise systems in order to steal
intellectual property, collect intelligence, or establish a foothold for future exploitation. The
theft through cyberspace of U.S. companies’ intellectual property risks long-term damage to U.S,
economic security. The damage inflicted by compromises of the defense industry goes well
beyond economic impacts. As the Director of National Intelligence has said, cyber theft “is
almost certainly allowing our adversaries to close the technological gap between our respective
militaries, slowly neutralizing one of our key advantages in the international arena.” /
(U) Cyber intrusions into private sector networks also have the potential to impact :
military operations. The private sector plays a crucial role in force mobilization, deployment, |
and sustainment operations. For example, private airlines provide more than 90 percent of
DOD’s passenger movement capability and more than one-third of its bulk cargo capability. In
addition, the overwhelming majority of DOD deployment and distribution transactions occur
over unclassified networks, many of which are owned by private companies, In fact,
TRANSCOM’s Commander has estimated that “over 90 percent of DOD deployment and :
distribution transactions are handled on unclassified systems,” ;

(U) Chinese military analysts, for example, have identified logistics and mobilization as :

potential U.S. vulnerabilities “given the requirements for precision in coordinating
transportation, communications, and logistics networks,” In fact, Chinese military doctrine

“advocate(s] targeting adversary command and contro! and logistics networks to impact their

ability to operate during the early stages of conflict." U.S, experts on Chinese military planning
have raised the prospect of China using cyber capabilities to impede U.S, force deployment in
the event ofa contingency,

(U) In discussing China's cyber capabilities, DOD has pointed out “the accesses and |
skills required for (stealing information) are similar to those necessary to conduct computer
network attacks. As the Defense Science Board (DSB) said in its 2013 report:

SEECREENOFORN-
Ik Cyber Threat Information-Sharing |
(U) Information sharing is one key to combating cyber threats. As Chairman of the Joint |
Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey has said, “every day, adversaries are injecting malware into our |
networks, the worst of this malware is equivalent to cyber bullets and bombs, We must share |
what it looks like so that we can stop it before it detonates.” |
|
(U) While TRANSCOM can monitor its own network for possible cyber intrusions, the i
command’s knowledge of intrusions into contractor computer networks depends on reporting i
from the contractors themselves, other DOD components, the FBI, and other government |
agencies, The committee's inquiry found, however, that TRANSCOM is only aware of a small |
fraction of APT intrusions into its contractors. In fact, TRANSCOM was aware of only one of |
11 APT intrusions detected by a subset of TRANSCOM contractors from whom the committee
. requested information. In addition, TRANSCOM was only aware of one of at least nine
successful APT intrusions and none of six other cyber events targeting TRANSCOM contractor
networks that were known to the U.S. government,
A. TRANSCOM Contractor Intrusion Reporting |
(U) Beginning in 2010, in what may be the first effort by a DOD component to use |
contract language to improve cyber intrusion information-sharing, TRANSCOM began including
a clause in its contracts requiring that certain cyber security incidents be reported to the
command. While more than 80 companies are subject to the clause, up until August 2013,
TRANSCOM had received only two cyber intrusion reports from those contractors. In order to |
assess how companies were complying with reporting requirements, the committee requested ‘
information from 11 TRANSCOM contractors about cyber intrusions they experienced between
January 1, 2013 and June 30, 2013 and how they determined whether or not the intrusions were
reportable, The group included six Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) airlines, three shippers who /
are participants in the Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement (VISA) and two companies that i
provide the command with logistics systems support services. '
|
. (U)Ofthe 11 contractors, eight said that they were not aware of any cyber intrusions
having occurred during the period in question. (That does not necessarily mean the eight
contractors were not victims of a successful intrusion during that period, only that they were not |
aware of such an intrusion.) The remaining three companies identified a total of 32 intrusions,”
As reflected in the chart below, of the 32 intrusions, 11 were associated with an advanced |
persistent threat (APT) actor. In describing APTs, the FBI has said “the sophistication,
resources, and types of information sought [by APT actors] suggest governmental support.” i
(U) €8All 11 were attributed to China. |
|
j One of those intrusions occurred in August 2013, which Is outside the period Initially covered by the committee's
inquiry,

| |
(U) Of those 11 APT intrusions, TRANSCOM was aware of only one. One reason for |
that was a lack of common understanding between the command and its contractors as to the
scope of cyber intrusions that must be reported. In fact, none of the contractors with whom the
committee discussed the issue interpreted their reporting obligation in a manner consistent with
TRANSCOM’s intent. In addition, TRANSCOM’s contract clause limits the scope of what must
be reported, only requiring companies to report intrusions into networks that are storing or |
communicating DOD data at the time of the compromise. That limitation could be highly
problematic when, in the event of a major contingency, a contractor’s ability to support defense :
requirements depended on the efficient functioning of computer networks normally reserved for :
commercial business. A prior or preexisting compromise of such networks could be exploited to |
affect the contractor and potentially TRANSCOM operations.
B. Intra-governmental Information Sharing
(U) Ensuring that defense contractors inform DOD about cyber intrusions into their |
networks is critical to mitigating cyber threats, However, that alone will not solve the problem,
Timely intra-governmental information sharing about private sector network compromises is i
also essential, particularly when network compromises involve an APT.
(U) The commitltee’s inquiry identified at least 20 successful intrusions or other events |
targeting TRANSCOM contractors that occurred between June 1, 2012 and May 31, 2013 and

were known to the FBI, DSS, DC3, or AFOSI. Fifteen of those 20 were associated with an
advanced persistent threat actor (APT) and at least nine of those 15 were successful intrusions
into a contractor network. TRANSCOM was aware of only one of those intrusions and none of |
the other events.

(U) The reasons TRANSCOM was unaware of those intrusions include misperceptions |
about the rules governing how cyber intrusion-related information may be shared and a lack of
common understanding between the command and other DOD components about what cyber
information TRANSCOM needs to know.
(U) A 2011 FBI-DOD Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) requires the Bureau to
share information on cyber intrusions with DOD when an intrusion is attributed to an APT and |
the Bureau knows that the victim is a defense contractor. While the FBI is in the process of
integrating the full list of more than 10,000 cleared DOD contractors into their information-
sharing database, no DOD component had provided the Bureau a list of specific operationally
critical contractors about whom they would like to be informed when they have been the victim
of a cyber intrusion. On January 30, 2014, TRANSCOM provided the FBI a list of 80
companies. That list, however, included all command contractors who are subject to
TRANSCOM’s cyber incident reporting clause and did not identify which of the 80 are |
operationally critical contractors.
vi
SECRET/NOFORN SECREFANOFORA-

(U) Depending on the identity of the victimized company and whether the FBI knows
which military service has a contract with the victim, the DOD recipient of FBI information may
include DSS and AFOSI, the military department counterintelligence office responsible for
TRANSCOM. In fact, of the 15 APT intrusions and other cyber events identified by the FBI, |
AFOSI said that it was aware of 11. As to DSS, while the agency said that it was aware of eight |
intrusions affecting victims on the FBI's list, its records were not sufficient to determine whether |
the actual /nfrusions matched those identified by the FBI or whether DSS had been made aware |
of additional intrusions.

(U) The information sharing MOU requires DOD recipients of FBI information to seek
the Bureau’s permission in order to share FBI information outside of their organizations. The
FBI did not receive a single request for a DOD agency to share information relating to the 15
APT intrusions and other events targeting TRANSCOM contractors. Neither DSS nor AFOSI
identified a connection between TRANSCOM and victimized contractors on their own. Not
until January 30, 2014 did TRANSCOM provide FBI and AFOSI a list of contractors about |
whom the command would like to be alerted when they were compromised by an APT.
TRANSCOM was made aware of only one of the APT-attributed intrusions identified by the
FBI.

(U) While it may receive cyber intrusion reports from the FBI, the Defense Cyber Crime
Center (DC3) aiso receives reports of intrusions directly from companies who are members of
the agency’s Defense Industrial Base Cyber Security and Information Assurance (DIB CS/IA)
Program. In fact, DC3 was informed of 10 successful intrusions affecting six TRANSCOM |
contractors who were DIB CS/IA members during the period covered by the committee's
inquiry. TRANSCOM, however, was aware of only one of those 10 intrusions. While DC3
does not normally share the identity of DIB CS/IA members who have been victimized by the |
cyber intrusion, DOD has said that identity information may be shared when a national security
interest is at stake. As of February 1, 2013, however, TRANSCOM had not requested that DC3
notify the command about cyber intrusions into specific operationally critical contractors.
TRANSCOM did provide the FBI and AFOSI with a list of about 80 contractors on January 30,
2014, though that list did not specify which of the contractors were operationally critical. |

(U) Cyber intrusions into operationally critical contractors pose a threat to defense
operations. It is essential that potentially-affected commands, such as TRANSCOM, be aware of
such intrusions so that they can take steps to mitigate the threat. The committee's inquiry |
identified serious gaps in intrusion reporting and information sharing that left TRANSCOM
uninformed about the overwhelming majority of intrusions by APT actors into computer |
networks of its contractors. That is a problem that must be fixed. As General Dempsey put it
“[W]e can't stop an attack unless we can see it.”

Conclusions of the Senate Armed Services Committee
(U) Conclusion 1: Cyber intrusions by foreign countries into the computer networks of
U.S, Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) contractors pose a threat to U.S. military
operations. The private sector plays a crucial role in force mobilization, deployment, and
sustainment operations and the overwhelming majority of Department of Defense (DOD)
deployment and distribution transactions occur over unclassified networks, many of which are
owned by private companies. That reliance on the private sector is not lost on potential US. ; |
adversaries, For example, according to DOD, Chinese military analysts have identified logistics
and mobilization as potential U.S. vulnerabilities “given the requirements for precision in
coordinating transportation, communications, and logistics networks.” U.S. experts, meanwhile,
have raised the prospect of China using cyber capabilities to impede U.S. force deployment in
the event of a contingency. Peacetime cyber compromises of the networks of operationally
critical contractors could prove valuable to foreign governments as a source of intelligence about
network operations or to establish a foothold in contractor networks, either of which could be
exploited in a contingency.

(u) <SF)-Conclusion 2: Advanced persistent threat (APT) actors associated with the Chinese |
government successfully penetrated TRANSCOM contractor computer networks on more
than 20 occasions during a single year. The committee's inquiry identified approximately 50
successful intrusions or other cyber events targeting TRANSCOM contractor computer networks
that occurred between June 1, 2012 and May 30, 2013. Of those, at least 20 were successful
intrusions attributed to an “advanced persistent threat” (APT), a term used to distinguish |
sophisticated cyber threats that are frequently associated with foreign governments, All of those i
APT intrusions were attributed to China, Among those companies victimized by the intrusions i
were operationally critical contractors including airlines and shipping companies. i
(U) Conclusion 3: TRANSCOM was unaware of the overwhelming majority of successful
cyber intrusions by advanced persistent threat (APT) actors into the computer networks of |
their contractors, While nearly all of the at least 20 successful APT intrusions identified in the
committee's inquiry were known to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Air Force
Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), the Defense Security Service (DSS), or the Defense
Cyber Crime Center (DC3), TRANSCOM was aware of only two of those APT intrusions.

(U) -~#OUO}Conclusion 4: Rules governing information sharing do not preclude defense
agencies from informing TRANSCOM about APT cyber intrusions such as those identified :
in the committee’s inquiry, TRANSCOM has said that information sharing rules have, at i
times, prevented the command from learning whether one of their contractors has been the
victim of a cyber intrusion. Of the at least 20 successful APT intrusions discussed in the
committee's report, about half were identified by the FBI, Most of those were known to DSS, |
AFOSI, or both. The committee’s review did not identify any rules that should have prevented :
those defense agencies from informing TRANSCOM of the identity of the victimized
contractors. While they may have had to seek FBI approval to do so, the committee identified no

Introduction |
(YU) Numerous government and private sector reports have identified Department of Defense
(DOD) contractors as high priority targets for foreign government cyber operations. While much |
of the discussion about the national defense implications of that targeting has focused on the
theft of DOD information, cyber intrusions pose operational risks as well, In discussing China’s
cyber capabilities, for example, DOD has said that “the accesses and skills required for
[intrusions targeted at stealing information] are similar to those necessary to conduct computer |
network attacks.” Given that, it is critical that DOD be aware of cyber intrusions into contractor i
networks, particularly when those intrusions affect contractors on whom the department relies to .
meet critical military requirements in contingency situations.
(U) In April 2013, the committee initiated an inquiry into how much is known about |
cyber intrusions into private DOD contractors that support U.S. Transportation Command |
(TRANSCOM). The committee focused on TRANSCOM because of the central role that the
command plays in contingency mobilization, deployment, and sustainment operations and the |
critical capabilities that TRANSCOM contractors provide to meet military requirements in |
contingency operations. |
(U) In the course of the inquiry, the committee reviewed information provided by i
TRANSCOM, !1 command contractors, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Defense |
Security Service (DSS), the Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3), and the U.S. Air Force Office |
of Special Investigations (AFOSI), The committee also reviewed TRANSCOM's cyber incident
reporting requirement, cyber intrusion reporting provisions included in the Fiscal Year 2013
National Defense Authorization ACT (NDAA), and a number of executive branch guidelines, |
directives, and agreements to assess their impact on cyber threat information sharing. This report
describes the committee’s findings.
|
(U) The committee's inquiry identified about 50 successful intrusions and other cyber i
events targeting TRANSCOM contractors between June 1, 2012 and May 30, 2013. Of those, at :
least 20 were successful intrusions into TRANSCOM contractor networks attributed to an
“advanced persistent threat” (APT), a term used to distinguish sophisticated cyber threats that are
frequently associated with foreign governments. Of those APT-linked intrusions, TRANSCOM |
was aware of only one, |
(U) Part | of the report is focused on the threat that cyber intrusions pose to defense
operations. The report discusses TRANSCOM’s reliance on unclassified computer networks and
private contractors to conduct operations and describes intelligence assessments of the cyber
threat to operations. Part I also discusses the importance of information sharing about intrusions |
to mitigate the cyber threat,
(U) Part I] of the report discusses the committee's finding that TRANSCOM was nol
aware of the overwhelming majority of cyber intrusions known to have affected the sample of
command contractors between June 1, 2012 and May 30, 2013. Those intrusions were known,

however, to the contractors themselves, to the FBI, ora DOD component. Part I! details several
factors that contributed to TRANSCOM’s lack of awareness of the intrusions, including gaps in :
cyber intrusion reporting requirements; differences in understanding between TRANSCOM and
its contractors as to the scope of cyber intrusions that must be reported; a lack of common |
understanding between TRANSCOM and other DOD components about what cyber information
TRANSCOM needs to know; and misperceptions about the rules governing how cyber intrusion-

1 The Cyber Threat to Defense Operations |
(U) Foreign governments regularly probe U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) and private
contractor computer networks to identify vulnerabilities that could allow them to compromise
systems and steal intellectual property (including weapons designs and other sensitive business
information), collect intelligence on U.S, military capabilities and intentions, and establish a
presence that could be exploited to degrade the U.S, response in the event of a contingency. |
|
(U) The theft through cyberspace of U.S, company intellectual property risks long-term |
damage to U.S. economic security. The cyber theft of defense-related information and
technologies, much of which also resides with private companies, threatens to erode U.S. i
military technical superiority, placing national security and the safety of our troops at risk. The j
national security implications of cyber intrusions into private U.S. companies go beyond those
related to the theft of intellectual property, Such intrusions also have the potential to adversely
impact military operations.
(U) The private sector plays a crucial role in force mobilization, deployment, and
sustainment operations. For example, private airlines provide more than 90 percent of DOD's
passenger movement capability and more than one-third of ils bulk cargo capability. In addition,
the overwhelming majority of DOD deployment and distribution transactions occur over |
unclassified networks, many of which are owned by private companies. Private companies also :
play an integral role in the development of software and systems to support military logistics.
These arrangements, while necessary, create vulnerabilities that could be exploited to degrade or |
disrupt the U.S. military’s response to contingencies,
(U) Information sharing about cyber intrusions into private sector computer networks is
one key to combating such threats. As Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey
has said, “every day, adversaries are injecting malware into our networks; the worst of this
malware is equivalent to cyber bullets and bombs. We must share what it looks like so that we
can stop it before it detonates.” As General Dempsey put it, “We can’t stop an attack unless we |
can see it.” I
A. Defense Intellectual Property Theft
(U) Every day, U.S companies face an onslaught of cyber attacks targeting their
intellectual property. Though it is difficult to estimate the economic losses suffered by |
companies who have their intellectual property stolen, General Keith B, Alexander, head of the |
National Security Agency and U.S, Cyber Command, has called the theft of intellectual property
through cyberspace “the greatest transfer of wealth in history,”
(U) In March 2013, Mandiant, a company that investigates private sector cyber security
breaches, published a report describing how a cyber-espionage unit of the Chinese People’s
Liberation Army (PLA) had raided the computers of at least 141 different organizations, stealing
“technology blueprints, proprietary manufacturing processes, test results, business plans, pricing
> Statement of General Keith Alexander, American Enterprise Institute Guly 9, 2012).

documents, [and] partnership agreements,” Industries identified in the Mandiant report as being
compromised by the PLA included many critical to U.S. national defense, such as information
technology, aerospace, and satellites and telecommunications.” In fact, companies that develop,
manufacture, and sustain critical weapons and information systems for DOD are a frequent target
of cybertheft and the Mandiant report was only one among many accounts of defense industrial
base companies being raided by the PLAS
B. Operational Implications of Cyber Intrusions |
(U) The damage inflicted by compromises of the defense industry goes well beyond
economic impacts, as the theft has operational implications as well, As the Defense Science
Board stated in a January 2013 report:
The DOD, and its contractor base are high priority targets that have sustained :
staggering losses of system design information incorporating years of combat
knowledge and experience. Employing reverse engineering techniques, j
adversaries can exploit weapon system technical plans for their benefit, Perhaps
even more significant, they gained insight to operational concepts and system use
... developed from decades of U.S. operational and developmental experience....
Such information provides tremendous benefit to an adversary, shortening time |
for development of countermeasures by years.”
|
(U) Likewise, the Director of National Intelligence has said that cybertheft “is almost |
certainly allowing our adversaries to close the technological gap between our respective
militaries, slowly neutralizing one of our key advantages in the international arena.’® |
|
(U) Network intrusions that enable the theft of defense information and erode our
operational advantage in the long term may pose more immediate threats to defense operations.
In discussing China’s cyber capabilities, DOD has stated that “the accesses and skills required i
for [intrusions targeted at stealing information] are similar to those necessary to conduct
computer network attacks,” As the Defense Science Board (DSB) said in its 2013 report:

sensitive technology involving drones, satellites, the U.S. Army's combat helicopter fleet, and military robotics,
both already-deptoyed systems and those still in development." According to Bloomberg, “hackers had burrowed
into almost every corner of QinetiQ's U.S. operations, including production facilities and engineering labs in St,
Louis, Pittsburgh, Long Beach, Mississippi, Huntsville, Alabama and Albuquerque, New Mexico, where QinetiQ

Should the United States find itself in a full-scale conflict with a peer adversary, i
attacks would be expected to include denial of service, data corruption, supply
chain corruption, traitorous insiders, kinetic and related non-kinetic attacks at all |
altitudes from underwater to space. U.S. guns, missiles, and bombs may not fire,
or may be directed against our own troops. Resupply, including food, water,
ammunition, and fuel may not arrive when or where needed. Military :
Commanders may rapidly lose trust in the information and ability to control U.S.
systems and forces. Once lost, that trust is very difficult to regain,'°
(U) As the DSB suggests, the ability to establish a foothold in DOD or contractor |
computer networks could provide a valuable position from which to target operations and affect |
the U.S. military’s ability to respond quickly or effectively in the event of a contingency.
C, Network-Dependent Military Logistics
(U) The Department of Defense relies heavily on the private sector for logistics support.
In fact, the head of U.S. Cyber Command has estimated that “more than 80 percent of our
logistics are transported by private companies.”!' The overwhelming majority of that business
activity takes place on unclassified networks. The Commander of U.S. Transportation
Command (TRANSCOM), which provides transportation services and logistical support to DOD
and the military services, has estimated that “over 90 percent of DOD deployment and
distribution information transactions are handled on unclassified systems.”""* TRANSCOM’s
Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) and Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement (VISA) programs {
are two examples of how DOD relies on private sector capabilities to meet military mobilization, f
deployment, and sustainment requirements. f
1, Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF)
(U) The Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) is a voluntary cooperative program between
private airlines, the Department of Transportation, and TRANSCOM to augment Department of
Defense airlift assets with commercial aircraft during emergencies such as war or natural
disasters. In exchange for making their aircraft available for deployments of military forces or
supplies during contingencies, CRAF companies are eligible to receive preference for DOD
peacetime business.'? Approximately 30 airlines participate in the program, although that

program is a partnership between the government and private shipping companies to meet
military sealift requirements, In exchange for their commitment to make ships and intermodal
facilities available during contingencies, VISA participants receive preference for DOD i
peacetime business, DOD is extremely dependent on commercial shippers to deploy and sustain
forces. According to TRANSCOM, in 2012 commercial vessels moved 95 percent of DOD dry

(U) Like the CRAF program, VISA is activated in three stages based on military

(U) The critical role of defense logistics in military operations and the Department's :

TRANSCOM’s ability to mobilize, deploy and sustain forces depends on the efficient
functioning of computer networks at both the command and the private sector service providers

a presence that could be exploited to impact operations.

Section II, between May 30, 2012 and August 15, 2013, there were at least 20 successful :
intrusions into TRANSCOM contractors that were attributed to advanced persistent threat actors. |
The term “advanced persistent threat” (APT) is used to distinguish sophisticated cyber threats |
from hackers or cyber criminals, While not limited to threats associated with foreign
governments, the FBI has said “the sophistication, resources, and types of information sought [by
APT actors] suggest governmental support," |
F. Cyber Information Sharing :
i
(U) While TRANSCOM can monitor its own network for possible cyber intrusions, the
command’s knowledge of intrusions into the computer networks of private sector service |

compromises that could impact TRANSCOM operations and strengthening network defenses to |
keep potential adversaries at bay.

(U) There are concerns about the amount of cyber threat information that the private
sector shares with the government. According to General Dempsey:
Right now, threat information runs primarily in one direction; from the
government into the operators of critical infrastructure, Very little information
flows back to the government.”
(U) There have been efforts to remedy that situation.
e (U) The Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3), a center within the Air Force’s |
Office of Special Investigations, stood up the Defense Industrial Base Cyber
Security and Information Assurance (DIB CS/IA) Program.” Through the DIB
CS/IA program, DOD contractors voluntarily report cyber intrusions they
experience to DC3.

contractors to report certain cyber intrusions.°> (Those requirements are described
in more detail in Section II.)
[
e (U) In July 2013, the Defense Security Service (DSS), a DOD component that |
acts as an interface between the government and cleared defense contractors,
issued guidance requiring cleared defense contractors, some of which have
contracts with TRANSCOM, to report certain cyber intrusions,
|
o (U) The Senate Armed Services Committee included a provision in the 2013
National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) requiring cleared defense
contractors to report certain cyber intrusions into their networks.
(U) These initiatives have increased the amount of information that private companies
share with the government about cyber intrusions that affect private networks, However, as I
discussed in Section II, critical gaps remain,
(U) It is also crucial that the government agency that receives such reports shares them
with the potentially affected military commands, That is particularly important when a
compromise involves an advanced persistent threat such as a foreign government.
Unfortunately, as discussed in Section II, intra-governmental information sharing about cyber
intrusions affecting DOD contractors is lacking.

however, even in those cases where command data was unaffected, intrusions into the computer :

I. SASC Inquiry
{
|

(U) In April 2013, the Senate Armed Services Committee initiated an inquiry into how |
much information was known to the U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) about

successful cyber intrusions affecting the command's contractors, In the course of the inquiry, the

committee reviewed information provided by TRANSCOM itself, 11 TRANSCOM contractors,

the FBI, the Defense Security Service (DSS), the Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3), and the i

US. Air Force Office of Special Investigations. i

(U) The committee also reviewed TRANSCOM's cyber incident reporting requirement, |
cyber intrusion reporting provisions included in the Fiscal Year 2013 National Defense |

Authorization ACT (NDAA), and a number of executive branch guidelines, directives, and i

agreements to assess their impact on cyber threat information sharing. |
(U) With respect to contractor cyber incident reporting, the committee found a lack of |
common understanding between TRANSCOM and its contractors as to the scope of cyber
intrusions that must be reported. The committee also identified gaps both in contractual |
reporting requirements and in the law that leave TRANSCOM uninformed about successful |
compromises of contractor networks by advanced persistent threat (APT) actors, including
foreign governments,
(U) As to intra-government information sharing, the committee found that TRANSCOM
is frequently unaware of reports of cyber intrusions that have been identified by the government
in the course of investigations or have been provided by contractors to the FBI or other DOD
components. The reasons for TRANSCOM being unaware of intrusions affecting its contractors
include a lack of common understanding between TRANSCOM and other DOD components |
about what cyber information TRANSCOM needs to know and misperceptions about the rules f
governing how cyber intrusion-related information identifying a particular victim may be shared. :
A. Cyber Incident Reporting from TRANSCOM Contractors

(U) In 2010, TRANSCOM began including a clause in its information technology |
contracts requiring contractors to report certain cyber security incidents to TRANSCOM. In
October 2012, the command expanded that requirement to its transportation contracts,>” As of
late 2012, more than 80 companies were subject to the cyber incident reporting clause as prime
or subcontractors,**

(U) The cyber reporting clause requires companies to report any intrusion event that
“affects DOD information resident on or transiting the contractor's unclassified information |
systems” and lists reportable cyber intrusions as those appearing to be an advanced persistent
threat; intrusions involving the exfiltration, manipulation or loss of DOD data; or those allowing
5° U.S. Transportation Command list of contracts containing cyber incident reporting clause (April 30, 2013).

unauthorized access to an unclassified information system on which DOD information is resident
or transiting,©*
(U) Between October 2010, when TRANSCOM first began inserting the clause in its |
contracts, and August 2013, the command received only two reports of cyber intrusions directly
from contractors subject to the clause.
(U) 48H3-The first of those was [EERNamamEme report from a commercial transportation

Poise neon ie a The company that submitted the report told the committee that it advised |
TRANSCOM of the incident even though the intrusion did not meet the reporting threshold in |
the company’s contract with TRANSCOM.” .
(U) The second of the two incidents reported to TRANSCOM affected a commercial
airline that is a TRANSCOM Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) contractor. (The CRAF program
is described in Section I.) The affected company advised the committee that the incident was
not determined to be reportable under the company’s contract with TRANSCOM but that they i
reported it anyway “out of an abundance of caution.”
(U) *64H9-That intrusion was attributed to China. |
(U) That only two incidents were reported by TRANSCOM contractors contrasts with |
reports suggesting widespread targeting of private sector computer networks, including those of
defense industrial base companies.
(U) In order to assess how companies were complying with TRANSCOM’s clause, the
committee requested information from 11 TRANSCOM contractors who are subject to the |
clause, about cyber intrusions they experienced in the first five months of 2013, and how they
determined whether or not the intrusions were reportable. The 1] companies included six Civil !
Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) contractors and three contractors who are participants in the
Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement (VISA) program, As discussed above, CRAF and
VISA members provide essential capabilities for deploying and sustaining U.S. forces, The |
committee also sought information from two contractors that provide services to support |
TRANSCOM logistics systems. |

SECRIFENGEORA-
1, Cyber Intrusions Known to TRANSCOM Contractors |
(U) Of the 11 contractors from whom the committee sought information, eight said that
they were not aware of any cyber intrusions affecting their networks between January 1, 2013
and June 10, 2013. The three remaining contractors, two of which provide information
technology support and one of which was a CRAF contractor, identified a total of 31 intrusions :
during that period. The CRAF contractor also identified an additional intrusion that occurred
later, in August 2013, bringing the (otal to 32 intrusions experienced by the three companies, |
(U) One of the two information technology support contractors experienced 24 of the 32 |
intrusions. [lowever, while the cyber incident reporting requirement was included in
TRANSCOM’s contract with the company, it was included as an option that TRANSCOM did
not exercise, Asa result, the company did not report any of the 24 incidents to TRANSCOM. /
Nor did the company evaluate the incidents to determine whether they would have been
reportable had they been subject to the requirement. The company did report those intrusions i
deemed significant to the Defense Cyber Crime Center's (DC3) Defense Industrial Base
Collaborative Information Sharing Environment (DCISE). DCISE is discussed in more detail
below.
(U) The second of the two information technology support contractors identified four
intrusions into their computer networks during the period in question. The company did not
report any of the four intrusions to TRANSCOM. The company advised the committee that it |
interpreted the cyber incident reporting clause to only apply to intrusions affecting a single :
computer network operated by a subcontractor, an interpretation that appears inconsistent with |
the reporting clause’s requirements and that TRANSCOM has subsequently said was not
reasonable,” The company did report the intrusions to DC3’s DCISE, though the company
failed to do so for anywhere from four to nearly seven months after they were discovered,
(U) The CRAF contractor advised the committee that it was also the victim of four
intrusions, none of which it determined were reportable under TRANSCOM's reporting clause.
The company, however, reporied one of the four intrusions to the Defense Security Service :
(DSS) and provided the same report to TRANSCOM “out of an abundance of caution.

deployment phase in contingency operations as potential U.S. vulnerabilities. Asa result, it is :

restrictions that would have otherwise prevented DSS or AFOSI from providing FB}-related
victim information to TRANSCOM. Nor is the committee aware of any internal DOD policies
or guidelines that would have prevented those agencies from sharing information about the cyber |
intrusions with TRANSCOM. DC3 learned of eight “probable” APT intrusions from |
TRANSCOM contractors during the period covered by the committee's inquiry. While
agreements between DC3 and companies that participate in its cyber intrusion information
sharing program restrict the dissemination of victim identities, those agreements do not preclude
such sharing when national security is at stake.
|
(U) Conclusion S: Prior to January 30, 2014, when the committee's inquiry was nearing
completion, TRANSCOM had not identified for FBI or DOD agencies a list of contractors
about whom the command would like to be alerted when an APT compromise occurred. It
is important that government agencies that receive information about private sector cyber
intrusions be aware when a victim of an APT-attributed intrusion is an operationally critical
contractor, However, when the FBI or a DOD component acquires information identifying a
U.S. company as a victim, it may not always be apparent that the company is a defense
contractor. Even in cases where a victimized company is known to be a defense contractor, it i
may not always be easy to identify the DOD component with which the company has a contract
or to determine whether the contractor provides a critical operational capability. That awareness
would be facilitated if commands, such as TRANSCOM, identified contractors about whom they
would like to be alerted when an APT compromise occurs, Prior to January 30, 2014, when it
supplied FBI and AFOSI with a list of 80 contractors, TRANSCOM had not provided FBI or any
of the defense agencies a list of contractors about whom the command would like to be alerted
when an APT compromise occurred. That list, however, included all command contractors
subject to TRANSCOM's cyber incident reporting requirement and did not specify which are !
operationally critical.
(U) Conclusion 6: TRANSCOM’s cyber intrusion reporting clause and reporting
requirements contained in the Fiscal Year 2013 National Defense Authorization Act
(NDAA) contain gaps that leave TRANSCOM uninformed about cyber intrusions affecting
operationally critical contractors. The intent of both TRANSCOM’s cyber reporting clause
and the cyber incident reporting provision contained in the 2013 NDAA was to require defense i
contractors to report cyber intrusions impacting systems that contain or process DOD |
information at the time of the compromise. In the event of a major contingency, however, a
contractor’s ability to support defense requirements might depend on the efficient functioning of :
computer networks normally reserved for commercial business. A prior or preexisting
compromise of a commercial network could be exploited to affect TRANSCOM operations |
when the contractor was called upon to support defense operations. |
(U) Conclusion 7; TRANSCOM and its contractors lack a common understanding about |
contractual cyber incident reporting requirements. Beginning in 2010, TRANSCOM began
including a clause in its contracts requiring that certain cyber security incidents be reported to the
command, However, the contract language is ambiguous and none of the contractors with whom
the committee discussed the clause interpreted their reporting obligation in a manner consistent
with TRANSCOM’s intent. Even if contractors shared TRANSCOM’s interpretation,

particularly important that TRANSCOM be aware of APT intrusions into the networks of
companics who enable logistics and support contingency operations. |
(U) As reflected in Chart 1. of the 32 intrusions reported to the commitice by the three
TRANSCOM contractors, | 1 were determined by either DOD or FBI to be associated with an |
APT threat. The remaining 21 were determined not io be associated with an APT.” As
discussed above, only one of the 1] intrusions associated with an APT was reported lo
TRANSCOM. ‘That intrusion, however, was not determined by the vielimized company to be
reportable under the cyber incident reporting clause and was only reported in “an abundance of |
caution”!

3. Cyber Incident Reporting Clause |

(U) In addition to asking the TRANSCOM contractors to identify cyber intrusions, the
committee also asked them how they determined whether or not the intrusions were reportable
under the requirements of the cyber incident reporting clause contained in their contracts with i
TRANSCOM. The committee's analysis of contractor responses and the contract clause itself
revealed that a lack of common understanding of contractor reporting obligations, the clause’s

limited scope, and some contractors’ inability to distinguish APT from other cyber threats, limit

the clause’s effectiveness. The discussion below focuses on the 11 intrusions reflected in Chart |

as having been attributed to an APT as those intrusions pose a particular threat to defense |

operations.
a. Common understanding of reporting obligations is lacking |

(U) In 2010 TRANSCOM began including a clause in its contracts requiring contractors |
to report certain cyber security incidents.” The clause states: ;

The contractor shall report...any suspected cyber intrusion events that affect DOD

information resident or transiting the contractor’s unclassified information

systems... Reportable cyber intrusion events include the following:

|

1, A cyber intrusion event appearing to be an advanced persistent threat. |
2. A cyber intrusion event involving data exfiltration or manipulation or

other loss of any DOD information resident on or transiting the |

contractor’s, or its subcontractors’, unclassified information systems,
3. Intrusion activities that allow unauthorized access to an unclassified

information system on which DOD information is resident or

transiting.” :

(U) While the first sentence in the clause refers to intrusions that “affect DOD
information,” TRANSCOM has said that it intended the clause to require contractors to report
any intrusion that allow access to a system on which DOD information resides or is transiting,
However, none of the contractors with whom the committee discussed the clause interpreted
their reporting obligation in a manner consistent with TRANSCOM’s intent.

|

(U) One CRAF participant advised the committee that it interpreted the clause to require
reporting of intrusions into their systems only if those intrusions affected DOD information, for
example through data exfiltration or corruption.”” Another CRAF contractor told the committee
that the clause required reporting of cyber intrusions that affect nonpublic DOD information.”

Executive Summary
“We can't stop an attack unless we can see it."
General Martin E. Dempsey

Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff i

June 27, 2013

(U) In April 2013, the Senate Armed Services Committee initiated an inquiry into how
much information was known to the U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) about
successful cyber intrusions affecting command contractors. The committee focused on |
TRANSCOM because of the central role that the command plays in mobilization, deployment, H
and sustainment operations and the critical capabilities that private companies contribute to |
TRANSCOM’s ability to meet military requirements in contingencies.

(U) Over the course of the inquiry, the committee reviewed information provided by
TRANSCOM, 11 command contractors, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Defense |
Security Service (DSS), the Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3), and the U.S. Air Force Office /
of Special Investigations (AFOS]), The committee also reviewed TRANSCOM's cyber incident i
reporting requirement, cyber intrusion reporting provisions included in the Fiscal Year 2013 |
National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), and a number of executive branch guidelines,
directives, and agreements to assess their effectiveness in promoting information sharing.

(U) The committee's inquiry identified approximately 50 successful intrusions or other
cyber events! targeting TRANSCOM contractors between June }, 2012 and May 30, 2013. Of |
those 50, at least 20 were successful intrusions into contractor networks attributed to an
“advanced persistent threat” (APT), a term used to distinguish sophisticated cyber threats that are
frequently associated with foreign governments. Of those APT-linked intrusions, TRANSCOM
was made aware of only two, a troubling finding given the potential impact of cyber intrusions
on defense information and operations.

. |
(U) <SA4)-Of the at least 20 successful cyber intrusions attributed to an APT, all were
attributed to China.
' Cyber events include incidents that may not be confirmed successful intrusions but which the FBI determined that !
a victim notification was warranted, /
i
BSECREPNOFORA- |
“SECREFNCFORE-

(U) In any case, complying with the reporting clause depends on a contractor knowing |
the systems on which DOD information resides or transits. Given the extent to which |
information is exchanged electronically, contractors may not always know where all contract- :
related documents and information are held and what networks are used to exchange them, For
example, one TRANSCOM prime contractor advised the committee that it subcontracted most i
contract tasks to another company. The prime contractor only considered intrusions into a |
computer network operated by that subcontractor as reportable.” In response to a committee |
request, however, the prime contractor found that contract deliverables were produced, circulated |
and maintained outside of that subcontractor network. In fact, the prime contractor found that
contract-related documents were not only maintained on multiple subcontractor networks but
were also maintained on the prime contractor's own systems.”

(U) Setting aside the lack of common understanding between the command and its |
contractors about the cyber incident reporting clause, TRANSCOM'’s own view that reportable
intrusions are limited to those that affect systems on which DOD information resides or transits |
leaves a critical gap.

b, Clause language limits scope of reporting :

(U) With respect fo intrusions attributed to an APT, TRANSCOM has said that it |
intended the cyber incident reporting clause to “require contractors to report cyber intrusions that :
appear to be an APT, and that affect systems on which DOD information is residing or |
transits.”®° Requiring companies to report only those APT-attributed intrusions that affect |
systems on which DOD information is resident or transits at the time of the compromise risks the |
command being uninformed about intrusions that could affect future operations. |

(U) For example, some commercial airlines that participate in the CRAF program may fly
either no or only a small number of CRAF flights in peacetime.®* Such airlines are likely to
retain only a relatively small amount of DOD information in the normal course and the number
of systems that information transits are likely similarly limited.®? Under TRANSCOM's i
reporting clause, an intrusion into an airline computer network that is not storing or |
communicating DOD data at the time of the compromise is not reportable, even if the intrusion is
extensive and linked to an advanced persistent threat such as a foreign government. Meanwhile,
unbeknownst to TRANSCOM, the foreign government that perpetrated the intrusion could be
performing reconnaissance or establishing a foothold in the compromised contractor’s network,
either of which could potentially be exploited to impact defense operations.

2. Defense Security Service |
(U) The Defense Security Service (DSS) oversees cleared defense contractor facilities to
ensure that classified information is protected, In a 2013 report to Congress, DSS stated that in
2012 it “began personal outreach to the cleared contractors to emphasize the requirement to
report suspicious contacts, including cyber incidents."'"” In July 2013, DSS issued an Industrial |
Security Letter (ISL) describing cyber incident reporting requirements for cleared defense
contractors. The ISL states: i
Although this requirement is not directed to unclassified information or systems,
contractors must report [to DSS] activities that otherwise meet the threshold for |
reporting,!"* including activities that may have occurred on its unclassified |
information systems,’
(U) In addition to reports of cyber intrusions that the agency receives directly from
cleared defense contractors, DSS also receives reports of cyber intrusions from the FBI. As
discussed above, the FBI and DSS frequently coordinate efforts to notify victims of cyber attacks
that they have been compromised and DSS is designated by an FBI-DOD information-sharing |
MOU to receive FBI counterintelligence information, including information relating to cyber |
intrusions, if the information pertains to a cleared DOD contractor,'?° |
|
a. Cyber incidents known to DSS |
(U) As discussed above, the FBI identified 20 intrusions or other cyber events targeting
16 of 79 TRANSCOM contractors. The committee asked DSS to review those 20 events and
identify how many of which the agency was aware, |

(U) In the event of a major contingency requiring the activation of CRAF Stage II or IJ, :
an airline’s ability to support defense requirements might depend on the efficient functioning of
computer networks that are normally reserved for commercial business. A prior compromise of
such networks could be exploited to affect the airline and potentially TRANSCOM operations. |

(U) To illustrate the limited scope of TRANSCOM's reporting clause, the committee |
reviewed the clause’s applicability to certain CRAF airlines, |

e. Analysis of cyber reporting clause gap

(U) As discussed above, the CRAF program was established to ensure DOD access to
critical airlift capabilities in contingency operations, TRANSCOM calculates “Mobility Value
Points” (MVP) to determine the value of aircraft that individual airlines commit to the CRAF |
program.” For example, total airline commitments to the international long-range passenger
component of CRAF were valued at 9,000 MVP in calendar year 2011. The value of
commitments made by individual airlines to that program ranged from zero to nearly 1,800 MVP
per airline. |

(U) The committee’s analysis indicates that more than 57 percent of the nearly 9,000 :
MVP for the 2011 international long-range passenger component of CRAF were assigned to :
airlines whose 2011 CRAF-related business, measured by block hours flown, composed less than |
0.01 percent of their total business for that year, Because they flew few or no CRAF flights, it is |
likely that those companies received or retained only limited CRAF-related DOD information |
during that period. As discussed above, TRANSCOM's cyber incident reporting clause extends |
only to intrusions that affect systems on which DOD information resides or transits as a result of
the company accomplishing CRAF-related tasks, As such, the number of systems implicated by
the reporting clause for companies who flew few or no CRAF-related flights in 2011 was likely
very small.

i

(U) This gap in the scope of intrusions that defense contractors are required to report is i

not limited to TRANSCOM's reporting clause, The information sharing provision that the |
committee included in the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act is similarly limited. The |
NDAA provision requires DOD to establish procedures requiring cleared defense contractors to
report when a network or information system is successfully penetrated, However, the reporting |
requirement applies only to networks or information systems that “contain[] or precess[] |
information created by or for the Department of Defense with respect to which such contractor is
required to apply enhanced protection.”

(U) When DSS receives a report that a cleared defense contractor’s computer network |
has been compromised, it memorializes the incident in a suspicious contact report (SCR). It is
DSS practice to share SCRs at the NCIJTF with all DOD and FBI components represented.!2 |
As discussed above, several DOD components are members of the NCITF, including AFOSI, :
the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), the Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3), U.S.
Cyber Command (CYBERCOM), and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).!°
(U) DSS may also circulate SCRs through “letterhead memoranda” (LHM). LHM may be

in DSS field offices and shared with local FBI and service investigative counterparts in the field,
They are sometimes shared with counterpart headquarter offices.""! DSS determines what
agencies should be copied on LHM based on a number of factors, including an assessment of :

(U) DSS told the committee that available records indicated that the agency was aware of
eight intrusions affecting TRANSCOM contractors. That number could be higher, however, as
DSS records are incomplete. DSS was unable to determine how many suspicious contact reports
associated with the eight intrusions were shared at the NCITF, However, DSS records indicate i
that the agency produced letterhead memoranda for four of those eight intrusions. Three of those

SEGCREFNOEORN—
(U) While the NDAA provision can be expected to advance information sharing about
cyber intrusions that result in the theft or manipulation of certain DOD information residing on |
contractor systems, it is not clear that it will increase contractor reporting about intrusions into |
commercial networks, like those of companies in the CRAF program, that may not typically :
contain or process DOD information. Further, the NDAA provision limits reportable intrusions :
to those that affect DOD information to which a contractor is required to apply “enhanced
protection.” It seems unlikely that intrusions affecting information maintained by a contractor in
the course of conducting their commercial business would fall within the scope of the law's
reporting requirement. As described above, however, even networks that typically conduct
commercial business and process little or no DOD information may be critical to military |
operations in the event of a contingency. :
(U) The NDAA provision is further limiting in that, even when a contractor does report a
cyber intrusion, it explicitly prohibits the report’s dissemination outside the DOD, unless that
dissemination is approved by the contractor that submitted the report.®” That prohibition could
impede the efficient flow of time-sensitive information relating to cyber intrusions to other
government agencies such as the FBI or other components of the Intelligence Community.
d, Ability to Identify TRANSCOM-Defined Advanced Persistent Threat
(U) Among reportable events listed in TRANSCOM's cyber incident reporting clause are
intrusions appearing to be an advanced persistent threat (APT). The contract clause defines an
APT as “an extremely proficient, patient, determined, and capable adversary, including two or |
more adversaries working together."®® The committee's review found that contractors are not
always able to determine whether an intrusion is APT-related, or meets TRANSCOM’s
definition.” |
(U) According to one TRANSCOM contractor, after reporting an intrusion to
government, the company was advised verbally by the FBI that the intrusion was APT-related.
However, the contractor told the committee that they “were not able to confirm that the incident
met the definition of APT specified in [the company’s] contract with USTRANSCOM,"™
Another contractor told the committee that, with respect to four intrusions they experienced,
indicators of compromise “did not provide sufficient evidence to enable [the company] to
conclude whether the attack was or was nol APT related."”! (The Department of Defense
subsequently advised the committee that the intrusions at issue were APT-related, 2)

B. Intra-Governmental fnformation Sharing
(U) As discussed in Section I, some private sector network compromises have the |
potential to impact defense operations. Increasing the amount of cyber threat information that
the private sector shares with the government is critical to mitigating such threats. However, |
improving the flow of cyber threat information for the private sector will not, on its own, solve
the problem. Timely intra-governmental information sharing about private sector network
compromises is also critical, particularly when network compromises involve an APT threat such
as a foreign government.
(U) To assess the state of intra-government information sharing, the committee sought
information from U.S. Transportation Command, the FBI, the Defense Security Service (DSS),
the Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3), and the Air Force Office of Special Investigations about |
cyber intrusions experienced by 79 TRANSCOM contractors, how information about those i
intrusions was shared within the government, and how current law, agency practices and |
preexisting agreements with defense contractors impact information sharing.
(U) As reflected in Chart 2, the committee found that TRANSCOM is frequently unaware
of reports of cyber intrusions that have been identified by other DOD components and
government agencies, The reasons for that include a lack of common understanding between :
TRANSCOM and other DOD components about what cyber information TRANSCOM needs to i
know and misperceptions about the rules governing how cyber intrusion-related information that i
identifies a particular victim may be shared.

(U) As discussed in Section I, computer networks that support defense logistics and :
mobilization are seen as potential U.S. vulnerabilities in cyberspace. However, AFOSI did not i
request approval to share information with TRANSCOM relating to any of cyber intrusions the |
FBI identified as having affected a TRANSCOM contractor and attributed to an APT." Nor |
had TRANSCOM provided AFOSI with a list of operationally critical contractors or requested |
that they be informed about cyber intrusions of specific contractors."“° On January 30, 2014,
TRANSCOM provided AFOSI a list of 80 companies, That list, however, included all command i
contractors who are subject to TRANSCOM's cyber incident reporting clause and did not i
identify which of the 80 are operationally critical contractors, 4 |
(U) As to why it, did not seek to share information with TRANSCOM relating to the |
intrusions of which it was aware, AFOS! told the committee that: |
[I]nvestigative actions on each incident were dependent on the level of DOD

(U) The committee requested information from DC3 about 79 TRANSCOM contractors
subject to the cyber incident reporting clause. Of those 79 TRANSCOM contractors, nine were
members of the DIB CS/IA program for at least some portion of the period between June 1, 2012 |
and May 30, 2013.'3_ During that period, seven of those nine companies reported a total of 146 |
“incidents” to DC3.'* Among those 146 incidents were ten successful intrusions involving a |
network on which DOD information was stored. Those ten successful intrusions impacted six
companies, '*5
(U) Each of the six companies who were the victims of intrusions was also represented
on the fist of 16 companies that the FBI identified as having been the victim of an intrusion or
other cyber event during that same period. However, DC3 was unable to determine whether
FBI-identified incidents corresponded with incidents reported to DC3 by those same
companies, ®°
(U) Bight of the 10 intrusions known to DC3 and involving a network on which DOD |
information was stored were determined to be “probable” APT intrusions. The remaining two

SECREPNOFORN—
a, Cyber Intrusions of TRANSCOM Contractors Known to the FBI
[
(U) The committee provided the FBI a list of 79 TRANSCOM contractors and
subcontractors subject to the cyber incident reporting requirement and asked the Bureau to
identify how many were notified between June |, 2012 and May 30, 2013 that they were the
victim of a cyber-intrusion.
(U) In response, the FBI told the committee that it notified 16 contractors on the list that i
they were victims of a cyber-intrusion or other cyber events during the period in question.” The
FBI notified four of those 16 companies of two discrete events each, bringing the total number of
cyber intrusions or other events known to FBI and affecting companies of the list of |
TRANSCOM contractors to 20.°7
(U) =€$}Of the 16 targeted companies identified by the FBI, six were airlines, two were
shipping companies, and eight were providers of technical services and other support to enable
TRANSCOM operations.” As discussed in Section 1, DOD relies on commercial airlines and
shipping companies to meet military requirements in contingencies. i
(U) Of the 20 total events, FBI advised the committee that 15 appeared to be associated |
with an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actor.” Nine of those 15 were successful intrusions |
of a TRANSCOM contractor. TRANSCOM was only aware of one of those.' |
(U) <8}FBI attributed all those 15 APT-linked events, including all nine successful
intrusions, to China,'®! |
b. FBI Information Sharing
i
(U) +F@¥O>}Information sharing between the FBI and DOD, including information relating
to counterintelligence, counterterrorism, and foreign intelligence, is poverned by a Memorandum |
of Understanding (MOU) signed by the Attorney General and the Secretary of Defense in
2011." An annex to that MOU that includes procedures for sharing counterintelligence
information and specifically addresses cyber threat information sharing states: i

advisory describes APT threats. “Advanced persistent threat actors differ from common hackers or cyber criminals |
by conducting targeted, rather than opportunistic, attacks that seek precise information rather than monetary gain, /
more closely resembling espionage. While the activity cannot often be definitively linked to any particular nation
state, the sophistication, resources, and types of information sought suggests governmental support.” Federal

(U) The timely sharing of information about cyber intrusions is critical for the DOD to
keep pace with the evolving cyber threat environment and to ensure DOD is aware of any
compromise that could impact military operations, To that end, the DCISE Framework
Agreement states that members of the DIB CS/IA program “will provide initial reports to |
DC3/DCISE within 72 hours of discovery or as soon as reasonably practicable.” The |
committee found, however, that companies do not always report intrusions consistent with the
Framework Agreement. In fact, one TRANSCOM contractor who was member of the DIB
CS/IA program reported intrusions to DC3 anywhere from four to nearly seven months after the
company discovered them, '®! : .
b. DCISE Framework Agreement
(U) Under terms of the DCISE Framework Agreement, contractors are required to report
cyber incidents involving the compromise or potential compromise of certain unclassified |
defense information on an information system “that processes, stores, or transmits” such i
information.'@ If an intrusion does not involve the compromise or potential compromise of
DOD information or such systems, the DIB CS/IA company is not obligated to report the
event,'® In that respect, the agreement contains a similar limitation to TRANSCOM'’s cyber
incident reporting clause, i.e, companies that may not currently store or process DOD
information but on whom TRANSCOM operations depend do not have to report certain i
intrusions ~ even when those intrusions are associated with an APT threat.
e, DC3 Information Sharing
(U) The DCISE Framework Agreement outlines the terms under which information |
reported by contractors may be shared outside DC3/DCISE.
(U) Under the Agreement, DC3 may share information, other than the identity of the
victimized company, with other companies who are members of the DIB CS/IA and with other f
government agencies, It states that identifying information will be maintained at DC3 “to the
maximum extent practicable” and that such information will be made available on a need-to-
know basis and upon the submission by a government agency of a written request and
justification.’
|
(U) According to TRANSCOM, because intelligence products, such as those produced
from contractor reports to DCISE, do not normally include the identity of the company that has |
been compromised, it is difficult for the command to determine whether a compromise is |
relevant to the TRANSCOM mission. The inability to make such a determination makes it :
difficult for the command to know when it should request the identity of a victimized company
and also to justify such requests. TRANSCOM advised the committee that it has not requested

When FBI investigations, including assessments, collect any information which |
indicates that a DOD organization or a contractor providing services to a DOD |
organization has been targeted by a foreign power using the cyber domain, the
FBI will report this to DOD in accordance with the procedures identified in
paragraph 5 below. The FBI shall provide information needed by DOD to
effectively assess the impact of the intrusion on DOD operations and to defend i
against the intrusion activity. Thereafter, DOD will coordinate all investigative
and operational activity with the FBI,!®
(U) RQWO}In cases where the FBI knows that an identified victim of a cyber intrusion is a |
DOD contractor, information sharing procedures contained in the annex state that FBI will report |
DOD-related counterintelligence information to the Defense Counterintelligence and Human |
Intelligence Center (DCHC) and the Military Department Counterintelligence Investigative
Organization (MDCO) “if specific military service affiliation is known” and to DCHC alone if it :
isnot. The Air Force is the Executive Agent!’ for TRANSCOM and the Air Force Office of
Special Investigations (AFOSI) is the Air Force MDCO.

information to DCHC and the Defense Security Service (DSS) “if the information pertains to a
cleared DOD contractor."!% |
|
(U) According to DSS, there are approximately 10,000 cleared contractors,'"” The FBI
Cyber Division has said that they are in the process of integrating the full list of cleared
contractors into their information-sharing database so they will be better able to determine when
an identified victim isa DOD contractor. However, even in cases where the FBI knows that a |
company compromised by a cyber intrusion is a defense contractor, the Bureau may not be aware |
which DOD component does business with the victimized contractor. No DOD component has
provided the FBI with a list identifying specific operationally critical contractors about whom
they would like to be informed when they were the victim of a cyber intrusion,’ On January |
