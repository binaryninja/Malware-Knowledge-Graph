2/30

In this intrusion from May 2022, the threat actors used BumbleBee as the initial access
vector. BumbleBee has been identified as an initial access vector utilized by several
ransomware affiliates.
In this intrusion, we see the threat actor use BumbleBee to deploy Cobalt Strike and
Meterpreter. The threat actor then used RDP and SMB to move around the network looking
at backup systems and file shares before being evicted from the network.

Case Summary
The intrusion began with the delivery of an ISO file containing a LNK file and a BumbleBee
payload in the form of a hidden DLL file. A user on a workstation mounted the ISO file and
executed the LNK file, running the Bumblebee payload.
Around 15 minutes after the execution of BumbleBee, multiple processes were spawned with
the goal of injecting Meterpreter into each of them. After the threat actors gained access with
Meterpreter, they began conducting reconnaissance on the workstation and network,
including querying domain controllers, mapping domain joined computers, enumerating
Active Directory trusts, and listing Domain Admin accounts. All of this first wave of discovery
relied on built in Windows utilities like nltest, arp, net, ping, nbtstat, and nslookup.
BumbleBee executed under a user with local administrator privileges on all workstations in
the environment. At around six hours after initial execution, we observed a new process
created that was then used to host a Cobalt Strike beacon, from the same command and
control server observed in a prior BumbleBee case. This beacon reprised discovery activity,
but also cut a common command short net user /dom instead of /domain , whether
from keyboard laziness or a trick to trip-up detections. The threat actor then used their
access to execute procdump via a remote service creation with the intention of dumping
credentials from LSASS from an adjacent workstation on the network.
Next, the threat actors moved laterally via RDP to a server. A new local user, sql_admin, was
created and added to the local administrator‚Äôs group and AnyDesk remote access software
was installed. Through the AnyDesk session, the threat actor was observed connecting to a
file share and accessing multiple documents related to cyber insurance and spreadsheets
with passwords.
A second round of enumeration was observed on the beachhead using AdFind, which was
executed via the Cobalt Strike beacon on the system. Following this second round of
enumeration, the threat actor moved latterly to a server hosting backups, via RDP and
interacted with the backup console. From the backup system, the threat actors also opened
internet explorer and attempted to load the environment‚Äôs mail server, likely checking for
Outlook Web Access.

3/30

A third round of enumeration, this time taking place from the first lateral server host, was
observed via a script named ‚Äò1.bat‚Äô that would ping all computers in the environment.
Following this third round of enumeration the threat actors were evicted from the
environment and no further impact was observed.
We assess with medium confidence this intrusion was related to pre-ransomware activity due
to the tool set and techniques the actor displayed.

Services
We offer multiple services including a Threat Feed service which tracks Command and
Control frameworks such as Cobalt Strike, BumbleBee, Covenant, Metasploit, Empire,
PoshC2, etc. More information on this service and others can be found here.
We also have artifacts and IOCs available from this case such as pcaps, memory captures,
files, event logs including Sysmon, Kape packages, and more, under our Security
Researcher and Organization services.

Initial Access
The BumbleBee malware has been following the trend of using the effective combination of
utilizing an .iso image containing a .lnk and .dll file. We have observed the same behavior
with other major malware distributors in previous reports:
IcedID ‚Äì Stolen Images Campaign Ends in Conti Ransomware
BazarLoader ‚Äì Diavol Ransomware
Using the event log, ‚ÄúMicrosoft-Windows-VHDMP-Operational.evtx‚Äù, we can quickly find
when the user mounted the .iso.

Upon clicking the LNK file the BumbleBee payload was executed.

"C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe" rundll32.exe tamirlan.dll,EdHVntqdWt

Execution
Following the user mounting the .iso file, they clicked on a .lnk file documents.lnk . As
noted in previous reports, the .dll is hidden from the user unless they display hidden items in
explorer like so:

6/30

The .lnk contains instructions to execute a specific exported function with the BumbleBee
DLL file.

When the .lnk was doubled clicked by the user, the BumbleBee malware tamirlan.dll
was executed:
C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe tamirlan.dll,EdHVntqdWt

The output of LECmd.exe, when used on documents.lnk , provided additional context to
where and when this .lnk file was created:
>> Tracker database block
Machine ID: user-pc
MAC Address: 9a:5b:d6:3e:47:ec
MAC Vendor: (Unknown vendor)
Creation: <REDACTED DATE>

Approximately 5 seconds after execution, the rundll32.exe process contacted the IP
154.56.0.221 . More information on this traffic is covered in the Command and Control
section below.
An interesting tactic of note, was the use of WMI and COM function calls to start the process,
used to inject into. The BumbleBee loader uses WMI to start new process by calling COM
functions to create a new process. Below you can see the COM instance creation followed
by defining the WMI namespace and WMI object being created ‚Äì ‚ÄúWin32_Process‚Äù.

7/30

Analysis of the loader found that a function of the malware chooses 1 of 3 target processes
before injecting the supplied code:
C:\Program Files\Windows Mail\wabmig.exe
C:\Program Files\Windows Mail\wab.exe
C:\Program Files\Windows Photo Viewer\ImagingDevices.exe

8/30

This resulted in new processes not being a child of BumbleBee, but rather WmiPrvSE.exe.

In this intrusion, an instance of C:\Program Files\Windows Photo
Viewer\ImagingDevices.exe was created and accessed by the BumbleBee
rundll32.exe process. Shortly after this interaction, the process started communicating to
a Meterpreter C2 3.85.198.66 . This process spawned cmd.exe and several typical
discovery commands that are covered in more detail below.
The second process, was spawned the WMI technique was an instance of C:\Program
Files\Windows Mail\wabmig.exe . This process was used to host both a session to
another Meterpreter C2 50.16.62.87 and a Cobalt Strike C2 server 45.153.243.142,
which was then used to conduct the majority of additional activity including credential
dumping and discovery exercises highlighted below. The pivot to using Cobalt Strike began
around 6 hours after the execution of the BumbleBee loader.

10/30

Persistence
A new local administrator user was created on a server to facilitate persistence on the
machine. The user account was observed to be accessed via an AnyDesk session on the
same machine.
C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe
‚ûù net user sql_admin [email protected]! /add
‚ûù net localgroup Administrators sql_admin /ADD

In addition, AnyDesk was installed as a service:

Defense Evasion
The BumbleBee loader itself uses several defense evasion and anti-analysis techniques. As
detailed in the Execution section, the use of WMI to spawn new processes is a known
technique to evade any parent/child process heuristics or detections.
Anti-Analysis
Once the malware is unpacked, it becomes quite apparent to what the malware author(s)
were looking for‚Äì
Known malware analysis process names running:

Known sandbox usernames (Sorry if your name is Peter Wilson, no malware for you
):

13/30

Specific Virtualization Software files on disk and registry keys (Virtual Box, Qemu,
Parallels), example:

Process Injection
Create Remote Thread ‚Äì The malware used the win32 function CreateRemoteThread in
order to execute code in rundll32.exe.

14/30

Named Pipes ‚Äì Two named pipes were created in order to establish inter-process
communications (IPC) between rundll32.exe and wabmig.exe.

\postex_515f
\postex_7c7b

Credential Access
ProcDump
A remote service was created on one of the workstations in order to dump lsass.

15/30

Event 7045 from Service Control Manager

C:\programdata\procdump64.exe -accepteula -ma lsass.exe C:\programdata\lsass.dmp

Discovery
The first discovery stage includes TTPs that we have seen in multiple cases, such as trusts
discovery, domain admin group discovery, network discovery and process enumeration.
C:\Program Files\Windows Mail\wabmig.exe
‚ûù C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C ipconfig /all
‚ûù C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C ping -n 1 <REDACTED_DOMAIN_NAME>
‚ûù C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C nltest /dclist:
‚ûù C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C nltest /domain_trusts
‚ûù C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C net group "domain admins" /domain
‚ûù C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C tasklist /v /s <REDACTED_IP>

AdFind
AdFind.exe was renamed to af.exe and was used by threat actors in order to enumerate AD
users, computers, OU, trusts, subnets and groups.
C:\Program Files\Windows Mail\wabmig.exe
‚ûù C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C af.exe -f "(objectcategory=person)" > ad_users.txt
‚ûù C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C af.exe -f "objectcategory=computer" >
ad_computers.txt
‚ûù C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C af.exe -f "(objectcategory=organizationalUnit)" >

‚ûù C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C af.exe -sc trustdmp > trustdmp.txt
‚ûù C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C af.exe -subnets -f (objectCategory=subnet) >
subnets.txt
‚ûù C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C af.exe -f "(objectcategory=group)" > ad_group.txt
‚ûù C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C af.exe -gcb -sc trustdmp > trustdmp.txt

Lateral Movement

16/30

The threat actor was observed moving via RDP throughout the network with a Domain
Admin account.

As mentioned in Credential Access, the threat actor used remote services to execute
commands on remote hosts.

SMB was used to transfer the various tools laterally, as needed in the environment, like
procdump.exe and AnyDesk executables.

17/30

Collection
The threat actor accessed multiple documents and folders from a remote file server. The
SMB share was accessed through a compromised server via an AnyDesk session.

The lsass dump file ran remotely, was copied to the beachhead through the admin share C$.
After being copied, the file was zipped using 7za.exe (7-zip), in preparation for exfiltration.

18/30

AnyDesk
AnyDesk was installed to facilitate interactive desktop command and control access to a
server in the environment.
Reviewing the ad_svc.trace logs from Anydesk located in %programdata%\AnyDesk reveal
the logins originating from 108.177.235.25. This was again the same IP observered in the
prior Bumblebee case.
info REDACTED 19:07:21.173 gsvc 1160 408 24 anynet.any_socket - Logged in from

Exfiltration
No exfiltration methods were observed beyond the established command and control
channels, which can be assessed as likely used to take data like the lsass dump out of the
network.

Impact
The threat actors were evicted from the network before any further impact.

Behavioral
The threat actor delivers the BumbleBee loader in the form of a DLL (tamirlan.dll)
via an ISO file named document.iso and tricks a user into executing it via an LNK
(document.lnk).
The threat actor dumps lsass using procdump and copies it over an admin share before
using 7zip to zip it.
BumbleBee is used to load both Meterpreter and Cobalt Strike into memory and
communicate with the C2 server.
