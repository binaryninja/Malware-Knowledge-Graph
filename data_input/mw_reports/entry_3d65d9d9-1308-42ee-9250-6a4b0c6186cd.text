Attackers believed to be linked to North Korea have Trojanized 3CX's DesktopApp, a widelyused voice and video calling desktop client. In an attack reminiscent of SolarWinds, installers
for several recent Windows and Mac versions of the software were compromised and
modified by the attackers in order to deliver additional information stealing malware to the
user’s computer. The information gathered by this malware presumably allowed the attackers
to gauge if the victim was a candidate for further compromise.

Attack chain
The attackers compromised installer files for at least two Windows versions (18.12.407 and
18.12.416) and two Mac versions (8.11.1213 and latest) of 3CX DesktopApp. The installers
contained clean versions of the app along with malicious DLLs. The app was used to
sideload the malicious DLLs, which then installed information-stealing malware on the
computer.
In two variants analyzed by Symantec (SHA256:
aa124a4b4df12b34e74ee7f6c683b2ebec4ce9a8edcf9be345823b4fdcf5d868 and
59e1edf4d82fae4978e97512b0331b7eb21dd4b838b850ba46794d9c7a2c0983), the clean
executable was used to load a malicious DLL named ffmpeg.dll (SHA256:
7986bbaee8940da11ce089383521ab420c443ab7b15ed42aed91fd31ce833896)
This DLL contains code that will load and execute a payload from a second DLL named
d3dcompiler_47.dll. (SHA256:
11be1803e2e307b647a8a7e02d128335c448ff741bf06bf52b332e0bbf423b03)
D3dcompiler_47.dll contains an encrypted blob appended to the file, suggesting that it is
possibly a Trojanized version of a legitimate file. The blob starts with the hex value
“FEEDFACE” which the loader uses to find the blob. The decrypted blob contains shellcode
and a third DLL (SHA256:
aa4e398b3bd8645016d8090ffc77d15f926a8e69258642191deb4e68688ff973).
The shellcode loads and executes this third DLL, export DLLGetClassObject with
parameters:
1200 2400 "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)
AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) 3CXDesktopApp/18.11.1197
Chrome/102.0.5005.167 Electron/19.1.9 Safari/537.36”
It will then attempt to download an ICO file from the following GitHub repository:

Mac versions

2/8

At last two macOS versions of the affected software were compromised in a similar fashion.
In this case a dynamic library named libffmpeg.dylib was Trojanized. There are at least two
variants of this file (SHA256:
a64fa9f1c76457ecc58402142a8728ce34ccba378c17318b3340083eeb7acc67 and
fee4f9dabc094df24d83ec1a8c4e4ff573e5d9973caa676f58086c99561382d7) and they seem
to relate to different versions of the software.
The malicious code is in the InitFunc_0 function of libffmpeg.dylib, it calls _run_avcodec
which starts a thread, in this thread it decodes some shellcode with XOR key 0x7A and then
will make a http request.
It attempts to download a payload from:
URL: https://msstorageazure[.]com/analysis
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML,
like Gecko) Chrome/108.0.5359.128 Safari/537.36

Mitigation
3CX is aware of the compromise and is advising users to immediately uninstall the app. It
said that it is working on an update to the software that will be released within hours. It
advised users to consider using its PWA client as an alternative until a clean version of
DesktopApp is released.
