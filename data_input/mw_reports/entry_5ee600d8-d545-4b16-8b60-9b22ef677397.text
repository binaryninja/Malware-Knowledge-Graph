Executive Summary
Warzone aims to be the Remote Access Trojan (RAT) of choice for aspiring
miscreants on a budget. It is sold on a publicly available website as opposed to on the
dark web, as a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) subscription-based platform. The initial
subscription to the malware’s basic RAT builder starts at only $22.95 per month, a
price-point which is more likely to attract novice threat actors (aka “script kiddies”).

Advanced features such as a rootkit, hidden process capability, premium dynamic
DNS (DDNS), and customer support are available with the upgraded subscription.
This premium version is called “Poison,” and it’s sold at a higher fee of $879 for a
three-month subscription.

Threat actors can also choose to purchase builders for document-based exploit
delivery, including a recently disclosed 2021 XLL Excel exploit that the malware author
claims is fully undetected, for $2100 per month.

Operating System

Risk & Impact

Technical Analysis
Warzone is marketed as a “C++ Native RAT” built for Windows®, as seen in the image
below of a post by @Solmyr of Hack Forums, which boasts of continuous updates, support,
and reliability. The RAT first appeared in 2018 and has received several updates since then.
This threat is often called “Ave Maria” due to a string it uses, but analysis by yoroi shows
that the command-and-control (C2) was using Warzones’ DDNS at
anglekeys.warzonedns[.]com.

As is common with malware building kits like this, there are multiple versions that have
been cracked and disseminated. These cracks often have Trojans or backdoors added, in
which case it is necessary to handle analysis even more carefully.
The latest major builder release is Warzone 2.7, which brought a Hidden Remote Desktop
Protocol (HRDP) update and support for Windows® 10 Home. HRDP functionality allows
the attacker to access the system at the same time as the victim without alerting them. This
version has been cracked (as shown in Figure 2) and is easily found on VirusTotal.

Figure 2 - Cracked folder file listing
This RAT is highly configurable. The malware operator can specify things like the IP
address and port for the C2 server, as well as payload name, startup options, Alternative
Data Stream (ADS) usage, and numerous other features as shown below.

Figure 3 - Configuration details pane
Changes that are made to the build options do not necessarily change the overall malicious
code, per se. Instead, changes are reflected in a set of configuration information options
that are stored in the build payload itself.
Due to this approach, the most recent release (2.7) builder produces all payloads with the
following Import Hash: 51a1d638436da72d7fa5fb524e02d427

4/14

The configuration information is stored in the BSS section RC4-encrypted, with the first
dword being the length of the key, followed by the key, then the data in Unicode.
The payload of the configuration information (as of 2.7) has been decoded as follows. All
flags are 01 if set, 00 if unset.

Figure 4 - Password capture management
Upon connection, the malware searches known file paths, as shown in Figure 4, for stored
credentials that it can automatically harvest. This can allow an attacker to potentially score
quick wins, such as escalating privileges or stealing financial information.

Figure 5 - Warzone keylogging
To extend the password stealing capacity, a silent keylogger (as shown in Figure 5) includes
functionality to track which files are opened, and which control keys have been typed.

6/14

The keylogger can be set up to continue collecting logs when the victim is not connected.
This is offered as an alternative to the automatic password stealer, allowing the malware
operator to attempt to catch logins not stored in the system.

Figure 6 - Post exploit options menu
The post exploitation options menu contains many robust choices for stealing
information/lateral movement. As shown in Figure 6 above, these options include the
following:
VNC connection
Reverse Shell
File explorer with option to download
Process manager
Remote webcam to access the victim’s camera
Password manager, configurable to dump stored credentials when the client connects
Uninstall remote client
Reverse SOCKS proxy
Download and execute, to push further malware to the system
Remote keylogger, configurable to continue storing keys when the client is offline
Hidden RDP
Privilege escalation options, in case the initial client was not configured to attempt
these
If the malware was not already run with elevated privileges, it will attempt to escalate its
privileges using an “sdclt” User Access Control (UAC) escalation. Sdclt is a file used in
Windows systems to allow the user to perform backup and restore operations.

7/14

Sdclt is used to automatically elevate privileges by calling another copy of itself as a
process with High Integrity level, bypassing the UAC prompt. Most program calls come from
a context of Medium Integrity; with an sdclt process running in High Integrity, it is now less
restricted on file and process access, as though it had been run by an administrator. This
elevated process then calls control.exe – the Windows Control Panel – which then attempts
to open the following registry key: HKCU\Software\Classes\Folder\shell\open\command.
Having done this, the malware sets the path to itself in this key, and it will now be run by the
sdclt process.
When run as an already privileged user, the malware runs the command “powershell AddMpPreference -ExclusionPath C:\” to create Windows Defender exclusions for the entire C
drive. This exclusion ensures the malicious actor can move more malware on to the system
without detection.
Persistence can be achieved by copying the payload to “%APPDATA%\\Roaming” and
writing a registry key in the path
“HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run.” This ensures that the RAT will
be run again each time the user logs in, such as during a system restart. Warzone allows
for customization of the install and startup names.
The malware also includes a configurable watchdog that will place a copy of itself in
“%ProgramData%” that will run in the event of an unexpected termination.
On its own, the builder attempts no evasion, and generates payloads which are readily
detected as malicious. To prevent such easy detection, many authors opt to use “crypters,”
which are programs that obfuscate the true nature of the malware until runtime. This author
has likewise written a crypter that is available for sale, which the author claims can bypass
most antivirus (AV) products.

XLL Exploit

8/14

Figure 7 - Advertising for XXL Excel exploit delivery
The author of Warzone has also made an XLL exploit builder for sale, which could be used
to embed a generated payload into an Excel file for delivery via phishing. While we were
unable to obtain a copy of this builder, XLL files are typically add-in files that allow thirdparty code to add extra functionality to Excel. They are intended to be structured like DLL
files and loaded in similar fashion.

9/14

The use of XLL files rather than traditional Excel XLS files for phishing is rare, so it’s
possible that malware authors may have taken notes from the Buer malware – which also
uses XLL files – and complicated analysis by signing their files.
