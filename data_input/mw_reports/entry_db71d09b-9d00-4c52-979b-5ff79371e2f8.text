RansomEXX
By Trend Micro Research
RansomEXX is a ransomware variant that gained notoriety after a spate of attacks in 2020 and continues
to be active today. With its targeted nature and history for choosing high-profile victims, we shine our
spotlight on RansomEXX to reveal its tactics, techniques, and procedures.

RansomExx is a ransomware variant that debuted as Defray777 in 2018. It made a name for itself in 2020,
after it was used in widely reported attacks on government agencies, manufacturers, and other such highprofile only months apart. By then, it was dubbed RansomEXX after the string “ransom.exx” was found in
its binary. In 2020, the group also started a leak site for publishing stolen data.
Today, RansomEXX remains an active name among other ransomware variants like LockBit and Conti.
Like other groups, the one running RansomEXX appears to have no qualms about publishing data stolen
from its targets. It has also published information stolen from government agencies — a recent case was an
attack on a Scottish mental health charity in March 2022, where they published 12GB worth of data that
included the personal information and even credit card details of the charity’s volunteers.
This paints a picture of how RansomEXX operates and why it should be thwarted. To help in this regard,
this report looks into its specific tactics, tools, and methods, so that organizations can be better prepared to
defend against it.

What do organizations need to know about RansomEXX

RansomEXX is another ransomware variant that runs on a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model and has
been consistently active since its discovery. Up to the present, RansomEXX has been responsible for
attacks and publishing stolen data on its leak site. Here is an overview of what RansomEXX is known for:
It has both a Windows and Linux variant. RansomEXX’s Linux version, discovered in late
2020, marked the first known time a major Windows ransomware variant expanded to Linux. This
move allows modern ransomware variants to target core infrastructure that are often running on
Linux.
Linked to the threat group Gold Dupont. The threat group has been active since 2018. They are
a financially motivated cybercriminal group with a main arsenal that includes RansomEXX or
Defray777, Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, and Vatet Loader.
Uses trojanized legitimate tools. RansomEXX campaigns, as typical of Gold Dupont attacks,
involve malware like Vatet Loader, PyXie RAT, TrickBot, and post-intrusion tools like Cobalt Strike
as part of their arsenal. The use of trojanized legitimate tools is common among modern ransomware
variants, allowing them to deploy payloads faster while avoiding detection.
Hardcoded name of the target in its binary. One of the key indicators of RansomEXX’s
targeted nature is how it has its target’s name hardcoded in its binary. It demonstrates how
RansomEXX attacks involve a certain amount of preparation and are tailored to their chosen victim’s
profile.
Aside from these known characteristics of RansomEXX, an interesting development in its more recent
history is its attack on a mental health charity. Prior to this particular attack, RansomEXX targeted larger
organizations like a government agency, a major clothing store in Brazil, and many others. Ransomware
groups are known to choose targets based on their ability to pay hefty ransoms, making the attack on the
charity organization a particular departure.
Operating as an RaaS, the actors behind RansomEXX conduct reconnaissance before each campaign to
help them choose the right tools from their arsenal to build an efficient attack. For example, RansomEXX
has employed IcedID and Vatet loader, among others, for an attack in which deploying the ransomware
only took five hours after initial access. The next sections look at the regions and industries the group has
targeted most often, based on our detections.

Our telemetry shows data on RansomEXX activity or attack attempts from March 31, 2021 to March 31,
2022. We observed RansomEXX activity from all over the globe, but the heaviest concentration was in USA
in France followed by Brazil. The reason behind this observation is the 2021 RansomEXX attack on a major
hardware manufacturer in Taiwan.

Infection chain and techniques

4/18

Given that RansomEXX operates on the RaaS model, its infection chain can vary depending on the target
and the affiliate carrying out the various stages of the attack.

Figure 3. RansomEXX infection chain

Initial Access
RansomEXX has been known to use Malspam to infiltrate machines and deliver multiple tools and
related malware before finally deploying the actual ransomware payload.

Execution and Exfiltration
The threat actors make use of different pieces of malware for execution. From our telemetry, we saw
IcedID, TrickBot, Cobalt Strike beacons, and PyXie RAT. These are known to be used in other
campaigns as well. PyXie RAT also has the capability to exfiltrate data and obtain information from
the target machine.

Lateral Movement
For lateral movement, multiple server message block (SMB) hits were seen on our telemetry. This has
been used to deliver VATET loader.

Discovery
Similar to other campaigns, RansomEXX also makes use of Mimikatz and LaZagne to extract
credentials from the target machine.

5/18

Impact
The deployment of the final ransomware payload ensures that files are encrypted in the machine.
RansomEXX encrypts files using advanced encryption standard (AES), while the AES key is
encrypted using RSA encryption.

Recommendations
RansomEXX is not as active as it had been in 2020, when its consecutive attacks made it one of the newer
ransomware families to watch out for. However, being a highly targeted and human-operated ransomware,
its attacks affect its victims and their reputation significantly. The combination of memory-based
techniques, legitimate Windows tools, and post-intrusion contribute a lot to RansomEXX’s successes.
Preventing the attacks from the outset is key to avoiding the worst of ransomware campaigns.
Organizations should learn from past RansomEXX campaigns and be vigilant against initial access tactics.
Users should be wary of enabling macros, and of documents that prompt them to do so.
To help defend systems against similar threats, organizations can establish security frameworks that can
allocate resources systematically for establishing solid defenses against ransomware.
Here are some best practices that can be included in these frameworks:

Audit and inventory
16/18

Take an inventory of assets and data.
Identify authorized and unauthorized devices and software.
Make an audit of event and incident logs.

Configure and monitor
Manage hardware and software configurations.
Grant admin privileges and access only when necessary to an employee’s role.
Monitor network ports, protocols, and services.
Activate security configurations on network infrastructure devices such as firewalls and routers.
Establish a software allowlist that only executes legitimate applications.

Patch and update
Conduct regular vulnerability assessments.
Perform patching or virtual patching for operating systems and applications.
Update software and applications to their latest versions.

Protect and recover
Implement data protection, back up, and recovery measures.
Enable multifactor authentication (MFA).

Secure and defend
Employ sandbox analysis to block malicious emails.
Deploy the latest versions of security solutions to all layers of the system, including email, endpoint,
web, and network.
Detect early signs of an attack such as the presence of suspicious tools in the system.
Use advanced detection technologies such as those powered by AI and machine learning.

Train and test
Regularly train and assess employees on security skills.
Conduct red-team exercises and penetration tests.
A multilayered approach can help organizations guard possible entry points into the system (endpoint,
email, web, and network). Security solutions that can detect malicious components and suspicious
behavior can also help protect enterprises.
Trend Micro Vision One™ provides multilayered protection and behavior detection, which helps
block questionable behavior and tools early on before the ransomware can do irreversible damage to
the system.

17/18

Trend Micro Cloud One™ Workload Security protects systems against both known and unknown
threats that exploit vulnerabilities. This protection is made possible through techniques such as
virtual patching and machine learning.
Trend Micro™ Deep Discovery™ Email Inspector employs custom sandboxing and advanced analysis
techniques to effectively block malicious emails, including phishing emails that can serve as entry
