Key Findings
Anomali Threat Research has discovered an open server to a directory listing that we
attribute with high confidence to the German-speaking threat group, TeamTNT.
The server contains source code, scripts, binaries, and cryptominers targeting Cloud
environments.
Other server contents include Amazon Web Services (AWS) Credentials stolen from
TeamTNT stealers are also hosted on the server.
This inside view of TeamTNT infrastructure and tools in use can help security operations
teams to improve detection capabilities for related attacks, whether coming directly from
TeamTNT or other cybercrime groups leveraging their tools.

Overview
Anomali Threat Research has identified a TeamTNT server open to directory listing. The
server was used to serve scripts and binaries that TeamTNT use in their attacks, and also
for the IRC communications for their bot. The directory appears to have been in use since
at least August 2021 and was in use as of October 5, 2021. The contents of the directory
contain metadata, scripts, source code, and stolen credentials.

2/19

TeamTNT is a German-speaking, cryptojacking threat group that targets cloud
environments. The group typically uses cryptojacking malware and have been active since
at least April 2020.[1] TeamTNT activity throughout 2021 has targeted AWS, Docker, GCP,
Linux, Kubernetes, and Windows, which corresponds to usual TeamTNT activity.[2]

Technical Analysis
Scripts (/cmd/)

3/19

Figure 1 - Overview of /cmd/
Contained on the server are approximately 50 scripts, most of which are already
documented, located in the /cmd/ directory. The objective of the scripts vary and include the
following:
AWS Credential Stealer
Diamorphine Rootkit
IP Scanners
Mountsploit
Scripts to set up utils
Scripts to setup miners
Scripts to remove previous miners

4/19

Figure 2 - Snippet of AWS Credential Stealer Script
Some notable scripts, for example, is the script that steals AWS EC2 credentials, shown
above in Figure 2. The AWS access key, secret key, and token are piped into a text file that
is uploaded to the Command and Control (C2) server.

Figure 3 - Chimaera_Kubernetes_root_PayLoad_2.sh
Another interesting script is shown in Figure 3 above, which checks the architecture of the
system, and retrieves the XMRig miner version for that architecture from another open
TeamTNT server, 85.214.149[.]236.

Binaries (/bin/)

6/19

Figure 4 - Overview of /bin
Within the /bin/ folder, shown in Figure 4 above, there is a collection of malicious binaries
and utilities that TeamTNT use in their operations.
Among the files are well-known samples that are attributed to TeamTNT, including the
Tsunami backdoor and a XMRig cryptominer. Some of the tools have the source code
located on the server, such as TeamTNT Bot. The folder /a.t.b contains the source code for
the TeamTNT bot, shown in Figures 5 and 6 below. In addition, the same binaries have
been found on a TeamTNT Docker, noted in Appendix A.

7/19

Figure 6 - Bot Commands
Lasty, the /bin/ folder also contains utilities including masscan, ngrok, peirates, pnscan,
wget, zgrab. These utilities will be used to aid in carrying out the malicious activity.

Metadata (/in/)
The folder /in/, shown below in Figure 7, contains interesting data which includes two
subfolders, AWS/ and results/. Inside of this folder appears to contain lists of S3 buckets
and stolen AWS credentials shown in Figure 8 and Figure 9 below, coming from the scripts
mentioned above. A file named “ngrok.authkeys.txt”, shown in Figure 10 below, displays an
error of a failure to bind to a TLS tunnel with an account name. Although it is unclear if
these are stolen credentials, TeamTNT have previously been reported to scan targets to
steal ngrok credentials.[3] Two text files, docker_ips.txt and weave_uniq.txt, contain lists of
IPs, with the Docker file totaling 13,282 IP addresses. Another file “HoneyPots.txt” contains
data referring to 484 Docker containers.

Conclusion
TeamTNT is a highly-active group that continues to evolve and target cloud infrastructure.
The discovery of their infrastructure gives insight into their toolsets. It is unknown at this
time whether TeamTNT have purposefully left this server open to directory listing, and why.
However this is not the first time TeamTNT server has been open, as reported by Unit42 in
June 2021.[4] Furthermore, the group appears unbothered with having their toolset
publicized, and will engage with security researchers on Twitter, even giving
recommendations of how the tools should be utilized.[5]

Appendix A
Docker Images
TeamTNT are also hosting malicious docker images on a Docker repo named “alpineos”.
The account contains 25 images, which includes XMRig, a reverse shell, moneroocean,
kubepwn, and TeamTNTbot builder. In some of these images the scripts are reaching out to
the scripts described above. In September 2021, CounterCraft released research on the
“alpinos/dockerapi” image.[6]
