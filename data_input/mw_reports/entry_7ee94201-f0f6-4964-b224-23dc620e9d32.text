Many thanks to Val Saengphaibul who contributed to this blog.
Affected platforms: Microsoft Windows
Impacted parties: Windows Users
Impact: Encrypts files on the compromised machines and demands ransom from the victim
to recover the encrypted files.
Severity level: High

1/11

Ranion is a Ransom-as-a-Service (RaaS) that has enjoyed unusual longevity as it has been
active since at least February 2017. While its activities and purpose—encrypting files on
compromised machines and receiving ransom payment from the user to recover their files—
may seem the same as other ransomware in the public’s eyes, the truth is that the inner
workings of Ranion RaaS are unlike other ransomware.
In this blog, FortiGuard Labs will explain how Ranion RaaS works.
The opening lines of The Tale of Heike, a martial epic about the civil war between the Taira
and Minamoto clans in 12th-century Japan, help describe the rise and fall of various
ransomware groups in 2021.
“The Jetavana Temple bells
ring the passing of all things.
Twinned sala trees, white in full flower,
declare the great man's certain fall.
The arrogant do not long endure:
They are like a dream one night in spring.
The bold and brave perish in the end:
They are as dust before the wind.”
― Royall Tyler, The Tale of the Heike

Ransomware Operations are Short-Lived
For those of us monitoring cybercriminal organizations and malware, ransomware often has
a very short shelf life. Some of the most notable ransomware movements in 2021 include:
Disappearance:
The REvil (aka Sodinokibi) gang that had been active since 2019 went dark in June.
The Avaddon ransomware group halted its operations in June. It had begun its
operations in 2019.
The Ragnarok ransomware gang, in operation since 2019, shut itself down in August
and released its decryption key.
Darkside first appeared in 2020 and closed in May after compromising a major US
pipeline company.
FonixCrypter ransomware gave up its criminal life in January and released a decryption
tool and its master decryption key. The master decryption key can decrypt all files,
regardless of the victim, that had previously been encrypted by FonixCrypter.
Debut and Rebranding:
Ads for Blackmatter ransomware went up on cyber underground forums in July. While
Blackmatter is not a rebrand of another ransomware, affiliation with the Darkside gang
is rumored.
2/11

Haron ransomware debuted in July and is based on Thanos and Abaddon
ransomware.
Doppelpaymar ransomware was rebranded as Grief (PayOrGrief).
SynAck ransomware was rebranded as El_Cometa in August.
Figure 1. Active Period for ransomware that halted/started operation in 2021
The average life span of the ransomware listed above, that either disappeared or rebranded
itself in 2021, is a bit less than two years. Reasons for halting operations vary from one
ransomware group to another, but they usually do so to escape the unwanted attentions of
law enforcement and security researchers.

Ranion Still Going Four Years Later
The Ranion ransomware variant that FortiGuard Labs recently came across bucks that trend.
The Ranison ransomware family appears to have been around since at least early 2017,
giving it more than four years of longevity. In February of that year, Daniel Smith at Radware
Security shed the first light on the Ranion ransomware, describing it as Ransomware-as-aservice. Surprisingly, its website on the Dark Web has remained relatively unchanged: the
Ranion developer still maintains its claim that Ranion was created for educational purposes
and asks users not to use the ransomware for illegal activities.
The latest version of Ranion, version 1.21, was released in July 2021. Amazingly, the Ranion
developer has updated the ransomware every month in 2021 (except for May), including
updates for detection evasion, which casts doubt on the claim that the ransomware is for
educational purposes. Another interesting data point is that version 1.08 was released in at
least January 2018 and was only updated seven times over a 35-month period (January
2018 – December 2020). However, it has seen rapid acceleration in its development in 2021,
with six updates over a seven-month period for unknown reasons. Each update made in
2021 contains additional code using an open-source program named ConfuserEx to evade
detection and protect the security vendors’ identities. We will touch on this part later.

Ranion RaaS Explained

Figure 2. Top of the Ranion ransomware web page on the dark web
The latest version of Ranion ransomware is designed to encrypt files on a compromised
machine using the following 44 file extensions, an increase of five new file types over
previous analyses (newly added extensions are highlighted in orange):

3/11

.wallet, .txt, .rtf, .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, .pptx, .odt, .ods, .pdf, .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .bmp,
.csv, .sql, .mdb, .db, .accdb, .sln, .php, .jsp, .asp, .aspx, .html, .htm, .xml, .psd, .cs, .java,
.cpp, .cc, .cxx, .zip, .rar, .pst, .ost, .eml, .pab, .oab, .msg
Although the ransomware is not designed to encrypt executable files, the Ranion developers
state that users “can request other additional file types/extensions to encrypt for free as any
files can be a target of Ranion ransomware.”

How Ranion Makes Money
Originally, back in 2017, Ranion offered users two support packages (a 1-year and a 6months service). Today, the Ranion team offers four support packages: Elite, Premium,
Standard, and Test.

Figure 3: Ranion ransomware packages and prices
Previously, the most expensive package was offered for 0.95 bitcoin and the cheapest for
0.60 bitcoin. In February 2017, one bitcoin was worth about 1,200 US dollars, which means
these packages sold for around 1,140 USD and 720 USD, respectively. As of September
2021, one bitcoin exchanged for around 50,000 USD so Ranion developers have adjusted
their prices, and they also now offer discounts for easy-to-buy add-on options.
Ranion’s business model is quite different from other RaaS vendors. Typically, Ransomwareas-a-Service vendors pay out 60%-80% of any ransoms collected to their “affiliates” that
have successfully installed their ransomware onto a victim’s machine. The Ranion
developers do not take a middleman’s cut. Instead, their affiliates pay for the RaaS service
upfront, and they then receive 100% of any ransoms collected. And while some RaaS
vendors try to recruit experienced affiliates, and often screen potential affiliates before
allowing them to sign up for the service, Ranion developers do not. This is one of the
reasons why many inexperienced affiliates start with Ranion. It allows then to get used to the
ransom operation. It is also a choice for affiliates who were unable to pass the screening
process imposed by other ransomware gangs, thereby lowering the bar for entry.
5/11

To see how well this model works, we tracked some Bitcoin wallets used by one of the older
Ranion samples for ransom payment. Two moderate payments, totaling about USD $153
and $460 worth of Bitcoin, were made to the wallet within a week of the Ranion sample being
made available. But a Bitcoin wallet used by Ranion has recorded transactions from two
other Bitcoin wallets. About $4.7 million USD worth of Bitcoin was transferred to one of those
wallets from over 300 different Bitcoin wallets.

Dropper Add-On
Another notable characteristic of Ranion is that it provides an opportunity for buyers to
purchase a dropper add-on. At first glance, a “dropper” may sound like a malware add-on
that Ranion affiliates can use to deliver ransomware, but it’s not. According to an FAQ posted
on the purchase site, the add-on dropper has the following description: “RANION can
download a program of yours (exe file) and execute it after encryption process ended.”
For example, an attacker might use this add-on to silently download and install a remote
access tool “RAT” on a victim’s machine infected with Ranion. Even if the victim opts to pay
ransom, the Ranion decrypter only decrypts the encrypted files but does not remove the RAT.
The Ranion affiliate can then turn to other RaaS services that are willing to purchase existing
corporate access (recent Lockbit 2.0 and Blackmatter RaaS quickly come to mind) and sell
that compromised victim for additional profit. This scheme can surely be “educational,” but
it’s only good for ransomware affiliates.

The Ranion Ransomware Delivery Method
The Ranion ransomware’s delivery method recently observed by FortiGuard Labs is very
straightforward. It was done through a spearphishing email with a zip file attachment that
included the Ranion ransomware executable. As Ranion is more suited for beginner threat
actors, the lack of sophistication in their ransomware delivery might be a reason why Ranion
has not gained household status in the ransomware realm. This may also be why they have
managed to stay under the radar for more than four years.
Figure 6: Recent spearphishing emails (in Spanish and French) used to deliver the Ranion
ransomware
Ranion’s ransom message supports eight languages by default (English, Russian, German,
French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, and Persian). Any regions in which those languages are
primarily used can be a target of Ranion.

Ranion Ransomware Origin: HiddenTear Copycat?
Ranion bases its code on the open-source proof-of-concept ransomware known
as HiddenTear. There are some code similarities between the two projects.
Figure 7: HiddenTear AES encryption
The above screenshot is from HiddenTear’s implantation of an encryption function. It can be
found at https://github.com/goliate/hidden-tear/blob/master/hidden-tear/hiddentear/Form1.cs. For comparison, Ranion’s implementation is below:
Figure 8: Ranion AES encryption
To encrypt files, HiddenTear uses this function.
Figure 9: HiddenTear file encryption
Ranion implements its encryption in a similar fashion.
Figure 10: Ranion file encryption
These are just two examples. Overall programming resemblance can be seen in a variety
places. In addition, Ranion kept their resource section similar to HiddenTear’s as well.
Figure 11: Ranion resource
NOTE: This Ranion variant is from 2017 and has a SHA256 hash value
of eed03a9564aee24a68b2cade89d7fbe9929e95751a9fde4539c7896fda6bdcb5

To Be FFFFUUUUDDDD
To be fully undetectable, the Ranion team has consistently relied on the ConfuserEx project,
which is the successor of the now defunct Confuser project. It is a free and open-source
obfuscator that makes malware harder to analyze by “protecting” .NET applications through
symbol renaming, anti-debugging, encryption, compression, and other functions. (For more
info, please see the github project page here.)
The 2017 Ranion variant analyzed below was “protected” by the Confuser project.
Figure 12: 2017 Ranion using Confuser
The following 2021 variant of Ranion was “protected” using the ConfuserEx project.
Figure 13: 2021 Ranion using ConfuserEx
While ConfuserEx is able to do what it says, which is “protect” .NET applications, in this case
it is protecting malware from being detected by the AV industry via evasion techniques.

Conclusion - Ranion Ransomware
HiddenTear-based Ranion is a low-profile, low-cost RaaS that has not achieved the same
success of other, more notorious ransomware gangs. However, this ransom service provides
enough basic features for new threat actors to use it as a steppingstone for working with
more sophisticated malicious services. Ranion is only “educational” in that it helps train
wannabe cyber criminals inflict the same damage as other ransomware variants that have
simply adopted more polished and sophisticated delivery and propagation mechanisms.
