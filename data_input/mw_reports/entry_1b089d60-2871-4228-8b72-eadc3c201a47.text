Vengeance Justice Worm (Vjw0rm) first emerged in November 2016; it's a hybrid
worm/Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that is publicly available and has modular functionality.
In January 2019 our team wrote about Vjw0rm here when it was being propagated by a
phishing campaign utilizing a banking lure.
Vjw0rm has 3 primary malicious capabilities:
1. Information Stealing - Exfiltrating cookie session data, clipboard strings, and attempts to
steal user credentials.
2. Self Propagation - Copies itself throughout the operating system and in the startup folder
and can spread via removable drive.
3. Denial of service (DOS) - Domain Name Service (DNS) request manipulation, and the
ability to send and receive spam email including advertisement flooding.

This time around we're seeing this malware group using RAR (compressed files created by
the WinRAR archiver) files with malicious JS (text file containing javascript code) files
embedded. In this campaign the bad actors are spoofing Maersk Shipping Line - A Danish
international container shipping company and the largest operating subsidiary of the Maersk
Group. Maersk is commonly spoofed because of its wide reach of customers and
prevalence in the shipping industry. The lure being used in today's is a shipment bill of
lading

Mitigation Tactics
1. If your organization doesn't regularly receive legitimate RAR files then we suggest
banning that file extension globally.
2. User education has never been more important, malicious actors are constantly
innovating and pivoting, users need to be on their game and know what to look for and what
not to click on. Establish an easy process in your company where users can submit
anything suspicious to your IT/Helpdesk team for review.
3. Defense in depth is something that your company should constantly strive for. A great
start would be by signing up for our Advanced Email Security!
