The ASEC analysis team recently identified Orcus RAT being distributed on file-sharing sites disguised as a cracked version of Hangul Word
Processor. The threat actor that distributed this malware is the same person that distributed BitRAT and XMRig CoinMiner disguised as a
Windows license verification tool on file-sharing sites.[1] The malware distributed by the threat actor has a similar form as those of the past,
except for the fact that Orcus RAT was used instead of BitRAT. Furthermore, the new malware is highly more sophisticated than the past
versions, considering the fact that it includes a complicated process to evade behavior detection by antivirus software and registers
PowerShell commands on the task scheduler to periodically install the latest malware.
File-sharing sites are the main platform alongside torrents used by threat actors to distribute malware to Korean users. Registered users
upload media files such as movies and TV series, as well as programs such as games and utilities, and also adult content. Other users can
pay a set fee and download the uploaded files. The ASEC analysis team is monitoring malware being distributed via file-sharing sites and has
shared information over multiple blog posts in the past.[2] [3] [4]
Unlike cases of malware distributed randomly by various threat actors using malware that can easily be found on the internet, the threat actor
that was distributing BitRAT and XMRig CoinMiner continues targeting Korean users, developing their malware themselves and making
attempts to evade AhnLab’s V3 products. Additionally, a cracked version of BitRAT has not yet been found, which shows us that although the
threat actor develops the malware themselves, the latest malware strains are sometimes purchased.
Orcus RAT is a Remote Access Trojan malware that has been sold since around 2016.[5] Orcus Technologies, which developed this program,
described this as a remote administration tool when selling the software, but as to be covered later on, it includes not only the remote control
feature, but also malicious features such as keylogging, collecting webcam and account information, and executing commands. Accordingly,
there has been a news article about Canadian authorities raiding the developers in 2019.[6]
Like other RAT malware, there is a cracked version of the Orcus RAT, and thus various threat actors are taking advantage of this in their
attacks. In this post, we will summarize the process from the initial distribution method where the threat actor induces the user to install the
malware, to ultimately having Orcus RAT and XMRig CoinMiner installed.

1. Distribution Method
The malware that installs Orcus RAT and XMRig CoinMiner is uploaded to multiple file-sharing sites under the disguise of a crack for Hangul
Word Processor 2022. Hangul Word Processor is a major Korean word processing program like Microsoft Office Word.

Figure 1. Malware uploaded to a file-sharing site
When the downloaded compressed file is decompressed, we can see a folder named “install” and a program named “install.exe”. This
“install.exe” file is the malware, and running this will execute an obfuscated PowerShell command and run the actual installer program in the
“install” folder.

Figure 2. The malware found upon

decompressing the file (install.exe)

2. Installer
Like other compressors, 7z supports SFX formats. Upon compressing a file using this format, .exe executable is created instead of .zip or .z
compressed file. This is often used in installation programs because of its convenience, like its ability to let the creator install programs to the
path of their choice simply by running the file. Not only does 7z SFX allow the installation of the included files, but it also has an additional
feature. If this feature is used, a specific command can be executed during the installation process.
The following is the installation script of “install.exe” (7z SFX). Besides the feature that runs the actual installer program, it also includes
encoded PowerShell commands. The malware copies the original PowerShell program to the current installation directory under the name of
the original program, “VC_redist.x86.exe” and uses this to run the encoded PowerShell commands. Going through this process instead of
directly running PowerShell seems to be an attempt to evade behavior detection by antivirus software.

Installation script of the 7z SFX portable executable
Decoding the encoded PowerShell command reveals the following. First, with the “Add-MpPreference” command, certain process names and
paths are set as exceptions to evade detection by Windows Defender Antivirus. While this is a commonly used method, the threat actor also
includes a process of allowing threats detected by Windows Defender.

Figure 4. Decoded PowerShell command
Afterward, it downloads files uploaded to Google Docs. Instead of directly downloading and installing the malware, the threat actor installs it by
first installing the 7z files, “7z.exe” and “7z.dll”, before downloading a compressed file, giving it the password “x”, and decompressing then
running it. This is also seen as an attempt to evade behavior detection by antivirus software.

3. Downloader
The initially installed malware is a downloader, and according to the set conditions, it installs different types of malware. The following is a
diagram showing the general flow.

Figure 5. Malware infection flow

The malware that is installed initially checks for a virtual machine environment and if the “asdmon” process is running, and if it is determined to
be an analysis environment, it is terminated. Afterward, it checks if an anti-malware software is currently installed, and its scan targets include
AhnLab V3 (“v3l4sp”, “V3UI”, “v3csp”) and Naver Antivirus (“Nsavsvc.npc”).

Figure 6. Main

function of the downloader malware
Before moving on to the installation process, the malware collects basic information such as the infected system’s username and IP address
and transmits this information via Telegram API.

Figure

7. Transmittal of the collected information via Telegram API
When all of the above processes are complete, it then copies the PowerShell executable to “C:\ProgramData\KB5019959.exe” and uses this
file. The PowerShell commands executed according to whether or not V3 is installed are mostly similar. The difference is that when V3 is
installed, XMRig CoinMiner is installed, and if V3 is not installed, a second downloader malware is installed.

Figure 8. A command that installs additional malware from Google Docs
Out of the files installed, 7z is the same as the one covered above, and the “GoogleUpdate.exe” file is a tool called NirCmd from NirSoft.
NirCmd is a command line tool that offers various features. With just simple commands, it can perform behaviors such as capturing
screenshots, emptying the recycle bin, and device control.

Figure 9. NirCmd installed by the threat actor
It is deemed that the threat actor installs NirCmd in the infected system in order to evade behavior detection by antivirus software. The
PowerShell command registered to the task scheduler is also run through NirCmd and a copy of the PowerShell executable. Examining the
task scheduler file downloaded from Google Docs and registered in the system reveals that it uses “GoogleUpdate.exe” (NirCmd) to execute
“Kb5019959.exe”, a PowerShell command, as shown below. The registered tasks are PowerShell commands encoded in a similar way to the
commands covered above, and they are responsible for installing XMRig or an additional downloader.

4. XMRig CoinMiner
The XMRig CoinMiner malware is installed under the name “software_reporter_tool.exe”. It executes explorer.exe, a normal program, before
injecting XMRig CoinMiner. This means that the actual mining behavior is performed in the explorer process. Additionally, it has the
characteristic of giving the following encrypted string as an argument to the target explorer for injection before running it.

Figure 11. XMRig

CoinMiner that receives an encoded string as an argument
XMRig, seen to have been created by the threat actor, decodes the strings it receives as arguments in the initial routine. The overall options
transmitted when XMRig is run are as follows.
–algo=rx/0
–url=xmr.2miners[.]com:12222
–user=”4AKATTrazYSEKTQhqwmH1Z9tu2jqF1pLzSEsRbTx9oMSPsBEGNSxPoV89vTajjEd3vbNfWLZPwvrkWURhZ194osPKJ3wDbC”

–cinit-version=”2.5.0″
–tls
–cinit-idle-wait=1
–cinit-idle-cpu=100
–cinit-id=”mijzwzakiitazgng”
Examining each option reveals that there are various settings including the mining pool address, user ID, and password. First, the “–cinitstealth-targets” option is used to designate management tools such as task manager, process hacker, and process explorer, so that when the
user runs these, the mining process is halted, making it difficult for users to notice that CPU usage has increased. There are multiple other
games that are also included, and the malware is set so that the mining process stops when the user is playing a game, in order to prevent the
user from finding out.
The “–cinit-kill-targets” option has the V3 product designated in it, so that when the user installs V3, it force-closes it, hindering the malware
treatment process. It also force-terminates grid-type PUP programs.

5. Orcus RAT
In the past, the threat actor installed XMRig in environments where V3 was installed, and BitRAT in other environments. However, it has
recently been identified that Orcus RAT is being installed instead of BitRAT. Additionally, the following condition must also be met; Orcus RAT
is only installed in environments that have Telegram or Visual Studio installed.

installing Orcus RAT

Figure 13. Settings data of the installed Orcus RAT
Like other RAT malware, Orcus RAT offers various features that let the treat actor control the infected system. The following is the Orcus RAT
management tool, cracked and disclosed.

Figure 14. Orcus RAT management tool
Orcus RAT has some differences from other simple types of RAT malware. Generally, RAT malware have the builder and management
program like those shown above act as the C&C server. In the case of Orcus RAT, however, instead of directly establishing a connection to
these management tools, it accesses the Orcus server. Thus, the management tools used by the threat actor to control the infected system
and the Orcus server which acts as the C&C server are separate.
This is similar to the structure of Cobalt Strike’s TeamServer. Orcus RAT communicates with the following Orcus server, and the Orcus
management tools used by the threat actor also establish a connection to the Orcus server. This allows the operator to control the Orcus RATs
connected to the Orcus server.

Figure 15. Orcus

RAT’s server
The following is a summary of the features offered by Orcus RAT. Orcus RAT can distinguish an infected system, and when “logged in” to the
system, it allows the threat actor to use basic control features such as collecting system information, file/registry/process tasks, and executing
commands.

control features offered by Orcus RAT – 2

Besides these, Orcus RAT also supports remote desktop, keylogging, webcam control, and RDP control feature. The RDP control feature
involves installing RDP Wrapper and creating an account named “OrcusRDP”. Afterward, the threat actor can use this account to log in
remotely.

Figure 18.

Account created after RDP Wrapper
Because Orcus RAT by default uses the TLC protocol in communications with the C&C server, packets are encrypted. The following is a
packet in communication between the Orcus RAT used in attacks and the C&C server. Here, we can see that the “Orcus Server” string used in
the certificate remains.

Conclusion
As malware is being distributed actively via Korean file-sharing sites, users need to take caution. Users must be wary when running
executables downloaded from file-sharing sites, and it is recommended to download products such as utility programs and games from their
official websites. Users should also apply the latest patch for OS and programs such as internet browsers, and update V3 to the latest version
to prevent malware infection in advance.
