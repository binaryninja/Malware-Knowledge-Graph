An Adversary Playbook by FortiGuard Labs
Adversary Playbooks provide detailed threat research on specific malicious campaigns or
threat actors so organizations may better understand the threats they face and align their
defenses accordingly.

Introduction
FortiGuards Labs recently discovered a malicious campaign targeting verticals in the
governmental monetary and financial sectors in Asia. This campaign poses as a central bank
of an Asian nation to compel a victim to open a compressed attachment containing a malicious

1/15

HTA file. Once the HTA file is executed, it contains heavily obfuscated JavaScript that
ultimately installs and runs a remote access trojan or RAT. What makes this unique from other
attacks in this space is that it utilizes JsOutProx.
The attacker has also been careful to ensure that the campaign goes undiscovered. This
playbook highlights the observed campaigns, the attack infrastructure, as well as provide new
updates about this unique threat.

Background
The world continues to shift towards working from home, with the pandemic accelerating this
shift. As a result, hybrid communications between corporate and home environments have
seen an uptick, becoming the norm for many organizations. Before the pandemic, it was
estimated that 3 percent of the United States workforce was working from home. That number
is now forecast to be around 30 percent after 2021.i
Because of this radical shift, attackers now have a greater attack surface to target than ever
before, including remote workers, personal devices, and home networks. Naturally, this
includes the use of email, via spearphishing attacks. Scouring our feeds, were able to locate
an interesting spearphishing attack and decided to investigate further, eventually leading us to
identify a newly updated JsOutProx campaign.
JsOutProx is a fully functional JavaScript remote access trojan (RAT) first discovered in
December of 2019. The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPS) of the attackers behind
JsOutprox indicate that these are experienced and sophisticated threat actors. Such indicators
include the time and effort the attackers have taken to create this RAT, as well as regular
updates that have made it more powerful. The actors also use specially-crafted social
engineering campaigns that leverage specific technical jargon unique to the verticals being
targeted in their spearphishing efforts.
JsOutProx also incorporates heavily obfuscated code and the use of Powershell to further
along their endeavours. This playbook highlights updates not noted elsewhere for this
relatively new malware family, as well as obeservations from FortiGuard Labs on the reuse of
the infrastructure in other historical campaigns.
Not much is known of JsOutProx campaigns as occurrences of this family have been few and
far between. First discovered by the YOROI team in December 2019, this malware family
again resurfaced in another campaign spotted by the ZScaler team in May 2020. ZScaler
observed that JsOutProx was infecting both governmental and financial institutions in India.
Based on our findings, this latest run follows the same exact model.
The names of the files containing malicious content attached to this most recent spearphishing
campaign are called:

2/15

Pilipina_Anti-Money_Laundering_Council_Resolution_pdf.hta
SHA256 – [c10ea9b5aade9e98b7c87a6926fed6356d903440a17590c519aec7a54e1e5165]
Information_on_Compliance_officer_xlsx.hta
SHA256 - [f1027d6f01718030a66872a82134418984c2de82e1aff32cb7cc106bf8d3375a]
The first file was sent to users in the Philippines working in the finance sector. It is specific to
anti-money laundering and countermeasures. This is consistent with a similar campaign we
found that used a forged email claiming to originate from an Asian government that offered
training in this specific vertical as well.

Why is this important?
RATs are usually portable executable (PE) files. JavaScript RATs are not common, mostly
because JavaScript simply does not offer as much flexibility as a PE file does. However, as
JavaScript is used by many websites, it appears to most users as benign, as individuals with
basic security knowledge are taught to avoid opening attachments that end in .exe. Also,
because JavaScript code can be obfuscated, it easily bypasses antivirus detection, allowing it
to filter through undetected.
The attackers in this case are most likely familiar with their targets. You can see this in the
findings reported by YOROI (including the capability to intercept the one time password (OTP)
token of a well known security vendor), the specially crafted emails from the Indian campaign
observed by Zscaler, and from the usage of terms specific to a niche sector (Anti Money
Laundering/FINTECH). At the very least, they’ve done their homework. They are not blindly
sending emails to random organizations but have taken the time to hone their spearphishing
efforts to compel unsuspecting victims into opening the malicious attachment.
In this playbook, we will present our findings on not only the latest campaigns, but also newly
discovered updates made to JsOutProx and its infrastructure. For a list of detailed indicators of
compromise, please visit our Playbook Viewer.

Technical Details
In this latest example, the attackers are using an Asian government entity as a lure for their
spearphishing tactics. It appears that the attackers are able to bypass spam filters by spoofing
the email headers. A cursory analysis of the domains indicate that they originated from a wellknown webhosting company with a large subnet. Investigating the headers, we see the
attackers are utilizing the SMTP service of the webhosting company.
Figure 1. Spearphishing email
In keeping with their previous government and financial themes, this email was allegedly sent
from the central bank of a country in Asia. The appeal of the email’s request for information
relies on the fact that with more people coming back to work, it is not unheard of to want more

3/15

information about prospective employees and employee training. At the very least, the email
appears to have been custom-tailored to increase the effectiveness of this attack—not just in a
technical sense, but also with the verbiage used in the spearphishing email. It contains terms,
such as AML/CFT, which is the abbreviation for Anti Money Laundering/Countering Financial
Terrorismii that would be familiar to receipients.
The attached archive contains the following Microsoft .HTA file:
Information_on_Compliance_officer_xlsx.hta
SHA256 - [f1027d6f01718030a66872a82134418984c2de82e1aff32cb7cc106bf8d3375a]
Once run, it communicates with the following command and control server using dynamic DNS
(DDNS):
hxxp://myabiggeojs.myftp[.]biz:9895
185.195.79[.]210
It then launches the malicious JsOutProx JavaScript, which is a fully developed and functional
remote access trojan (RAT).

Variations on a Theme
This next section provides an analysis of the changes to JsOutProx that we have observed in
this latest version versus the December and May variants. JsOutProx’s encoding and
encryption routines largely remain similar to past variants.
Figure 2. Obfuscation contains 5,000 lines
The attackers went to great lengths to make sure that their tradecraft would not be easily
understood. For example, we observed that the sample has over 5000 lines of obfuscated
code. Because of this, FortiGuard Labs had to develop a custom tool to de-obfuscate the
JavaScript to help us analyze the file, which saved us a great amount of time.
For example, when we ran our tool against the following sample
Information_on_Compliance_officer_xlsx.hta
SHA256 - [f1027d6f01718030a66872a82134418984c2de82e1aff32cb7cc106bf8d3375a]
it took over five hours to de-obfuscate and provide us with human readable strings for later
analysis.
Standard JavaScript engines and emulators may not necessarily be able to display the
relevant strings. A decryptor must be used to figure out what this threat does. Depending on
resources, it may take several hours to decrypt the script. In the end, however, it becomes
more readable.
Figure 3. Connecting to C2 along with hiding window size to 0x0
4/15

One of the first things we noticed is that this RAT can be executed both as a JavaScript file on
the command line, or as a .HTA file inside a window (in this case, inside mshta.exe). If it is
inside a window, the threat tries to hide the window by resizing it to a height of zero pixels and
a width of 0 pixels. Moreover, it gets moved to outside of the user’s viewable desktop for
further evasion.

New Additions to JsOutProx
Looking at the capabilities of this RAT, we see that it supports several commands. Newer
commands have been highlighted in GREEN and commands that have been deprecated are
highlighted in RED.

This new version accepts a new command called ‘rmz’ that modifies the zone identifier
contained in the alternate data stream of downloaded files.
Figure 5.
The malware may have had issues in the past with executing downloaded files. This newly
added functionality helps fix that problem by attempting to move the downloaded files across
different security zones.
JsOutProx can also use plugins. This allows the threat to be more modular and easier to
update and maintain. Once again, new plugin commands are in GREEN while the deprecated
plugin commands are in RED.

Figure 6. Table of plugins
Looking at the two previous tables, several commands and plugins have been removed. While
this may initially indicate that the malware is less powerful, the addition of the PowerShell
plugin actually makes the malware more extensible, requires less overhead to maintain, and
enables it to remain under the radar – aka “living off the land.” The following screenshot
displays some of the capabilities of this new plugin:

Figure 7. New capabilities added that allow for remote control/monitoring
Its ’capture’ function can take a screenshot of the user’s desktop in order to monitor what the
user is seeing. The plugin also allows the attacker to operate the infected machine using a
virtual keyboard and mouse. Previously, attackers could execute shell commands and file
manager functionality such as copy and execute. With this new plugin however, the attacker is
virtually sitting in front of the infected machine. Interestingly enough, the screenshell plugin
also lumps in the option to execute either .HTA files or java (.jar) files, as seen in the
screenshot below.

Connecting the Dots - JsOutProx Infrastructure – Same IP addresses,
Different DDNS Domains
Example #1
The following sample
Pilipina_Anti-Money_Laundering_Council_Resolution_pdf.hta
[SHA256- c10ea9b5aade9e98b7c87a6926fed6356d903440a17590c519aec7a54e1e5165]
was calling back to a C2 server at: hxxp://afghphae.gotdns[.]ch:9060 (185.19.85[.]156).
Historical DNS queries for this IP address yield two additional DDNS C2 servers that resolve to
the same IP address at:
hxxp://dirhaeednotrtup.hopto[.]org:9097

Further investigation into this domain [dirhaeednotrtup.hopto[.]org:9097] yielded no results.
The domain martinluther[.]tk doesn’t have a historical DNS entry, nor is any of the malware
being run associated with it that we can see.
[On a side note of interest, the Dot TK domain extension can be registered free of charge,
making it a favorite of phishers and attackers alike. Please reference our blog from 2019 that
highlights our findings on the abuse of these free services.]
However, as we dug deeper into our passive DNS records for the third DDNS domain
[bushaka009.duckdns[.]org], we discovered a completely different campaign altogether, one
that was leveraging multiple samples utilizing shipment schemes and leveraging the likeness
of an international shipping company. Campaigns began originating from this DDNS domain as
early as June 2020, with the last one seen in August. In the June campaigns, we saw that the
attackers used the same infrastructure to distribute the Netwire RAT:
Document Second Page.exe
SHA256
[F17B89058372618DB540C2A8D16A13F59F21C88E21B651D196556207AB54E10C
In July, the following sample
Dhl Shipment Receipt.exe
SHA256 [43192b0a36d887844309b79dafa88bb2493539093d17bf7296e4bda2fe72dc49]
communicated with 185.19.85[.]156 under the same bushaka009.duckdns[.]org using the
Formbook malware.
An expansion of this domain led us to this:
Figure 10. Malware related to bushaka009.duckdns[.]org
Our findings revealed 34 recent samples, from July to August of this year, which indicates that
this is a recent campaign. Our analysis revealed a variety of malware families being used,
such as Netwire, Remcos, Formbook, and other backdoors—all pointing to the same domain
but resolving to different IP addresses at the same time.

Activity of [185.19.85[.]156] spans more than five years
Because of the multitude of samples and dynamic DNS domains tied to this one specific IP
address [185.19.85[.]156], and to further satisfy our curiousity, we decided to investigate. As
threat researchers, it is not unusual to research an attacker infrastructure to deduce any
possible correlation to previous attacks. This can be a time consuming and exhausting
process, because there are a lot of data points to pivot off of. Sometimes we come to a dead
end as well. However, we sometimes find items of interest that help “paint a picture” that

9/15

identify previous campaigns likely conducted by the same threat actor. Ultimately, this helps
provide historical insight into the attackers’ TTPs, or identify a webhosting company allowing
this activity to occur for years on end, thereby enabling multiple attackers without any
repercussion.
Despite being a recently discovered campaign, our further research in this case revealed that
the infrastructure used by the attacker, [185.19.85[.]156], has been in operation for over five
years (as noted in this Dynamoo Blog.) We don’t know if this is the same group or if it is simply
a bulletproof host catering to threat actors. The usage of RATs, the same DDNS services, and
the same IP address 185.19.85[.]156 may be merely coincidental, but it raises some
suspicion.
Regardless of whether there is an actual connection, one assumption can be made: Based on
the specific language contained in the spearphishing attacks, the infrastructure used, and the
techniques seen in the evolving malware, this JsOutProx campaign is not your run-of-the-mill
cybercrime operation. It is highly sophisticated, and notably, one that has significant resources
available.
Example #2
Findings for this DDNS Domain were limited to the HTA files of JSOutProx and nothing else.
We discovered during passive DNS analysis from our own Central Threat System (CTS) that
the [185.195.79[.]210] IP address is shared between the two DDNS domains shown in the
table below.
Associated Files:

Other than this, no other historical campaigns nor historical data could be found for either the
domain or IP address used in this attack. It could be surmised that the attacker may be
switching back and forth between hosts and DDNS aliases to thwart further analysis.
Regarding the 151.106.60[.]163 IP address, only myabiggeojs.myftp[.]biz:9895 URLs were
associated.
