From WikiLeaks:
Today, 9 November 2017, WikiLeaks publishes the source code and development logs
to Hive, a major component of the CIA infrastructure to control its malware.
Hive solves a critical problem for the malware operators at the CIA. Even the most
sophisticated malware implant on a target computer is useless if there is no way for it
to communicate with its operators in a secure manner that does not draw attention.
Using Hive even if an implant is discovered on a target computer, attributing it to the
CIA is difficult by just looking at the communication of the malware with other servers
on the internet. Hive provides a covert communications platform for a whole range of
CIA malware to send exfiltrated information to CIA servers and to receive new
instructions from operators at the CIA.
Hive can serve multiple operations using multiple implants on target computers. Each
operation anonymously registers at least one cover domain (e.g. "perfectly-boringlooking-domain.com") for its own use. The server running the domain website is rented
from commercial hosting providers as a VPS (virtual private server) and its software is
customized according to CIA specifications. These servers are the public-facing side of
the CIA back-end infrastructure and act as a relay for HTTP(S) traffic over a VPN
connection to a "hidden" CIA server called 'Blot'. source: https://wikileaks.org/vault8/
