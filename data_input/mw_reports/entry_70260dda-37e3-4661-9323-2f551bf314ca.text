Keep up to date with latest blog posts
On February 15th, 2022, the FBI and US Secret Service issued a joint adversary on BlackByte ransomware and its indicators of compromise
(IOCs). According to the alert, BlackByte ransomware attacks on critical US infrastructures are on the rise. In this blog, we explained TTPs
used by the BlackByte ransomware group in detail.
Test your security controls against ransomware

BlackByte Ransomware Group
The BlackByte group is a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) operator and started its ransomware operation in July 2021. Since then, they
have targeted US-based organizations in critical infrastructure sectors such as government, finance, and food & agriculture. Also, they
compromised the network of the famous American football team, San Francisco 49ers, and released some of the confidential data belonging to
the team as proof of the attack.

Joint cybersecurity advisory from FBI and US Secret Service warns organizations that beware of the IOCs of BlackByte ransomware attacks
and take necessary precautions as the number of attacks is expected to increase.

What is BlackByte Ransomware?
BlackByte ransomware is the collective name of the ransomware variants from the BlackByte RaaS group. The ransomware was first reported
back in July 2021. It exploits ProxyShell vulnerabilities found in Microsoft Exchange Server for initial access. The patch for these vulnerabilities
is available. However, unpatched systems are falling victim to these ransomware attacks. Check out our blog post and learn how to prevent the
exploitation of ProxyShell vulnerabilities.
The ransomware does not attack the infected systems if the language setting is Russian or the languages of former Soviet republics. This
behavior is similar to some other ransomware threat groups, as explained in our previous ransomware blog, LockBit 2.0.
BlackByte ransomware variants only use symmetric encryption. In their earlier ransomware variants, The BlackByte threat group distributed
the encryption key to every victim from their command and control (C2) server in a .png file. Since the same encryption key is used for every
victim, Trustwave was able to devise a global decryptor [2]. After the release of the global decryptor, the ransomware group stopped delivering
the encryption key from the C2 server and changed the key. Although the decryptor might not work in some cases, it is worth a try as it does
not harm already encrypted files.
After encrypting the victim files, BlackByte ransomware appends the .blackbyte extension. The ransomware leaves the same ransom note in
all encrypted directories, and the ransom note includes a .onion link that instructs the victim how to pay the ransom and receive the decryption
key. Also, the ransom note claims that the ransomware has exfiltrated data from its victims to scare its victims to pay the ransom.

How Picus Helps Simulate BlackByte Ransomware?
Using the Picus Continuous Security Validation Platform, you can test your security controls against the BlackByte ransomware. We advise
you to simulate BlackByte ransomware attacks and determine whether your security controls can prevent them or not. Picus Threat Library
includes the following threats to simulate BlackByte ransomware.

MITRE ATT&CK Techniques Used by the BlackByte Ransomware

2/7

Reconnaissance
T1595.002 Active Scanning: Vulnerability Scanning
The Blackbyte ransomware group exploits several vulnerabilities in the Microsoft Exchange Server. The ransomware threat actors scan the
network of their targets and check whether the network has CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523, and CVE-2021-31207 vulnerabilities.

Initial Access
T1190 Exploit Public Facing Application
BlackByte ransomware threat actors exploit ProxyShell vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523, CVE-2021-31207) found in
Microsoft Exchange Server to gain initial access to the target network. Using ProxyShell vulnerabilities, the BlackByte RaaS group drops a
webshell with the .aspx extension.

Execution
T1053.005 Scheduled Task/Job: Scheduled Task
BlackByte ransomware utilizes Scheduled Tasks to launch its executable and print ransom notes using the printers in the victim’s network.
Scheduled Tasks used by
BlackByte

Description

complex.exe -single
<SHA256_hash>

The ransomware executable is named “complex.exe”. The purpose of the hash value is unknown; it might
be the identifier of the victim.

cmd.exe /c for /l %x in
(1,1,75) do start

This command attempts to open tree.dll in Wordpad 75 times and then prints the contents. tree.dll contains
the ransom note.

wordpad.exe /p
C:\Users\tree.dll.

T1059.001 Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell
T1059.003 Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell
