Mitigate Microsoft Exchange On-Premises Product
Vulnerabilities
cisa.gov/ed2102

CISA partners have observed active exploitation of vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange onpremises products. Neither the vulnerabilities nor the identified exploit activity is currently
known to affect Microsoft 365 or Azure Cloud deployments. Successful exploitation of these
vulnerabilities allows an attacker to access on-premises Exchange Servers, enabling them to
gain persistent system access and control of an enterprise network.
CISA has determined that this exploitation of Microsoft Exchange on-premises products
poses an unacceptable risk to Federal Civilian Executive Branch agencies and requires
emergency action. This determination is based on the current exploitation of these
vulnerabilities in the wild, the likelihood of the vulnerabilities being exploited, the prevalence
of the affected software in the federal enterprise, the high potential for a compromise of
agency information systems, and the potential impact of a successful compromise.
CISA issued ED 21-02 requiring federal civilian departments and agencies running Microsoft
Exchange on-premises products to update or disconnect the products from their networks
until updated with the Microsoft patch.
Currently, the vulnerabilities related to this known exploitation activity include CVE-202126855, CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858, CVE-2021-27065. According to Microsoft and
security researchers, the following vulnerabilities are related yet not known to be exploited:
CVE-2021-26412, CVE-2021-26854, CVE-2021-27078.
CISA published a Remediating Microsoft Exchange Vulnerabilities web page that strongly
urges all organizations to immediately address the recent Microsoft Exchange Server
product vulnerabilities. As exploitation of these vulnerabilities is widespread and
indiscriminate, CISA strongly advises organizations follow the guidance laid out in the web
page. The guidance provides specific steps for both leaders and IT security staff and is
applicable for all sizes of organizations across all sectors.

until updated with the Microsoft patch.

Alerts and Guidance
MAR-10330097-1.v1: DearCry Ransomware identifies ransomware that has been used to
exploit compromised on-premises Exchange servers. The malware encrypts files on a device
and demands ransom in exchange for decryption.
MAR-10331466-1.v1: China Chopper Webshell identifies a China Chopper webshell
observed in post-compromised Microsoft Exchange Servers. After successfully exploiting a
Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerability for initial accesses, a malicious cyber actor can
upload a webshell to enable remote administration of the affected system.
On March 31, CISA issued supplemental guidance to ED 21-02. The supplemental guidance
provides additional forensic triage and server hardening requirements for federal agencies.
Specifically, the supplemental direction requires agencies to run newly developed tools—
Microsoft’s Test-ProxyLogon.ps1 script and Safety Scanner (MSERT)—to investigate
whether their Microsoft Exchange Servers have been compromised.
Updates on Microsoft Exchange Server Vulnerabilities: On March 13, CISA has added seven
Malware Analysis Reports (MARs) to Alert AA21-062A: Mitigate Microsoft Exchange Server
Vulnerabilities.
FBI-CISA Joint Advisory on Compromise of Microsoft Exchange Server: On March 10, CISA
and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have released a Joint Cybersecurity Advisory
(CSA) to address recently disclosed vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server.
