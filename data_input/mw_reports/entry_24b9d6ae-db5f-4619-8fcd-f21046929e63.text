The following release statement provides a brief summary of
information related to the “1.php” Group dating from 2008 to
present. This Group’s methods tend to be spear-phishing emails
with malicious PDF attachments or web links to binary executables
with a Poison Ivy remote administration tool (RAT) payload. The
Group’s targeted victims included China/US relations experts,
Defense entities, and the Geospatial industry. Zscaler detected
repeated infections from this Group to a customer related to this
target list. The following report summarizes the incident details to

Introduction
Zscaler provides inline security and policy enforcement of web
and email transactions to include full-content inspection and
comprehensive transaction logging and analysis. Given that
many of Zscaler’s customers are large enterprises, it is not
surprising that some have been the target of so called Advanced

Persistent Threats (APTs). During the course of our daily activities
researching various threats, Zscaler ThreatlabZ often uncovers
infected hosts that we believe have been compromised via
attacks that bear the signature of an APT attack. While there is no
universally accepted definition of APT attacks, for the purposes
of this paper we will leverage Richard Bejtlich’s blog post on the
subject1.

of computer intrusion. They can use the most pedestrian
publicly available exploit against a well-known vulnerability, or
they can elevate their game to research new vulnerabilities and
develop custom exploits, depending on the target’s posture.
• Persistent means the adversary is formally tasked to
accomplish a mission. They are not opportunistic intruders. Like
an intelligence unit they receive directives and work to satisfy
their masters. Persistent does not necessarily mean they need
to constantly execute malicious code on victim computers.
Rather, they maintain the level of interaction needed to execute
their objectives.
• Threat means the adversary is not a piece of mindless code.
This point is crucial. Some people throw around the term
“threat” with reference to malware. If malware had no human

data, etc.), then most malware would be of little worry (as long
as it didn’t degrade or deny data). Rather, the adversary here
is a threat because it is organized and funded and motivated.

“1.php” Group Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)
There is a good deal of information in the public domain related to
“1.php” Group incidents (malware and C&Cs) that can be correlated with
incident activity that we identify and detail within this report. Intrusion
activities related to this Group date back at least to 2009, if not earlier
(there is one sample we found dating back to 2008). For example, a
December 7, 2009 blog post by Contagio2 details a malicious phishing
email regarding United States troop deployment in Afghanistan that

“

Once unzipped,
the malware is a
Windows executable
with an SCR extension
that is identified as a
Poison Ivy RAT variant.

provides a malicious link to:
File name: WWW.DREAMLIFES.NET/Afghanistan/Afghanistan.zip.
MD5: 052E62513505A25CCFADF900A052709C
Once unzipped, the malware is a Windows executable with an SCR
extension that is identified as a Poison Ivy RAT variant. Beyond simple
phishing attacks with links to malware, the Group also sends spearphishing emails with malicious PDF attachments to their targets. For
example, the SANS ISC Handler’s Diary drew attention to this Group’s
phishing campaign exploiting CVE-2009-4324 in January 2010. A
screenshot of their story headline is below in: Figure 1 SANS ISC Diary
Headline related to “1.php” malware campaign3.

This file received commands from: CECON.FLOWER-SHOW.ORG.
More recently, in July 2011, open-source reports4 exist of Poison Ivy
usage surrounding the FLOWER-SHOW.ORG domain. This incident
exploited PDF vulnerabilities (CVE-2010-2883) in attached spear-phishing
emails targeting experts on Japan, China, Taiwan / USA relationships.
See a screenshot of the email in: Figure 2 Spear-phishing email with

information may be garnered from the open-source community, but the
above should be a sufficient introduction into the tactics, techniques, and
procedures (TTPs) of this Group.

Alleged APT Intrusion Set: “1.php” Group

Zscaler has observed on-going attacks from June 2010 to present,
involving a Cleared Defense Contractor. Given the entity involved and the
characteristics of the traffic observed, Zscaler believes that the attack is
directly related to the “1.php” Group. While these attacks appear related
to the “1.php” Group, the beacons do not bear the previously mentioned
“1.php” HTTP path. However, there are many similarities regarding
these “new” beacons as well as direct relationships regarding previously

ongoing attacks against

identified domains and IPs used by the “1.php” group. Presumably,
these “new” beacon behaviors have been altered to evade any
signatures designed to detect the previous “1.php” beaconing behavior.

2.1 GET Beacons with Modified XOR Parameters
One of the first variations that we noticed in the attacks, was that the
infected hosts sent HTTP GET request check-ins to URLs with the
general pattern of:
FQDN/css.ashx?sc=[data1]&sp=[data2]&ad=[data3]&dh=[data4]&mr=[d
ata5]&tk=
The data parameters contained the same victim information as
mentioned in the “1.php” beacons and were also base64 encoded
and XORed with a key. Examples of C&Cs that we observed for this
particular check-in variant include:
•
•
•
•
•
•

HOUSE.SUPERDOGDREAM.COM
HOME.ALLMYDEARFRIENDS.COM
GOOGLETIME.SERVEIRC.COM *
INFO.SPORTGAMEINFO.COM
PEOPLE.ENJOYHOLIDAYS.NET
PEARHOST.SERVEHALFLIFE.COM *
(June 2010 – 1st C&C observed in infection)

Page 8

Alleged APT Intrusion Set: “1.php” Group

The next variation that we noticed in attacks, involved the infected hosts
sending HTTP GET request check-ins to URLs with the general pattern of:
FQDN/[data1]/[data2]/[data3]/[data4]/[data5]
The data did not appear to be XORed in the same manner as the beacons
that were previously identified. However, based on size and number of
data blocks, it appears that the beacons contain similar information from
the victims. Examples of C&Cs used in this infection variant include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

SATELLITE.QUICKSEARCHMOVIE.COM
WWW.TOYHOPING.COM
WORK.FREETHROWLINE.NET
SEA.ANIMALFANS.NET
WWW.SEARCHSEA.NET
LOVE.ANIMALFANS.NET
WWW.JOBCALL.ORG

“

…it is currently
believed that the
infection point was
through malicious email
attachments (as was the
case in many of
the “1.php” OSINT
incidents).

2.2 GET Beacons with Data moved to URL path

-Zscaler ThreatLabZ

2.3 HTTPS CONNECTs to C&Cs
The latest variations on these attacks are related to customer infections
beginning on August 3, 2011. Prior to infection for this incident, as well
as the previous ones listed, web transaction logs did not provide any
strong evidence of the infection point – it is currently believed that the
infection point was through malicious email attachments (as was the
case in many of the “1.php” OSINT incidents). Following infection, many
web transactions were witnessed each hour to the C&C servers via
HTTPS with the following behaviors:
•
•
•
•
•

CONNECT on port 443/TCP with 200 HTTP response code
HTTP request version 1.0 with HTTP response version 1.1
Request size for “keep-alive” beacons were primarily 227 – 228 bytes
Response size is most commonly between 969 – 990 bytes
Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 user-agent string (hard-coded into
malware, as this is not a standard browser for this customer)

Section 3: Incident Inter-Relationships
There are a number of domains and IP addresses that have been tied to
the previously mentioned incidents. Toward the beginning of the report
it was stated that we believed all of these incidents to be related. As
has already been seen, there are some similarities across the incidents,
such as same victim organization, similar beaconing data blocks, and
infection believed to be from malicious email attachments. However, the
strongest evidence for their relationship is the fact that related domains
and IPs are used for C&Cs across these incidents.

Past experience with APT-style incidents show that hostnames may be
used to identify the C&C for particular victims of interest. For example,
in bakerhughes.thruthere.net9 was a C&C used against Baker Hughes
in the disclosed Night Dragon10 attacks. There have been a number
of interesting hostnames used with “1.php” C&C domains that may
indicate other potential victims. These hostnames potentially identify
victims within the US Government (USG), Defense Industrial Base (DIB),
and Geospatial industry. The above link-graph provides one example of
such an entity that has information about its attacks already disclosed in

the open-source (QinetiQ).
“QINETIQ” or “QNAO” (QinetiQ North America Operations) for example,
was an HBGary customer. HBGary supported QinetiQ in detection
and analysis of on-going targeted attacks against them. Following the
Anonymous compromise and leakage of HBGary information, there is
significant information in the public domain regarding the attacks against
QinetiQ. One such example is HBGary’s Incident Response Technical

Report Supplement for QinetiQ11 . Page 8 of that report, in the “History
of the strain” section states:
HBGary has code-named this threat group as “Soysauce”. This group
is also known as “Comment Crew” by some, and also as “GIF89a” by
some. The choice of codename is completely arbitrary in this context
and is simply meant to identify a group of Chinese hackers who have
a consistent agenda to target the defense industrial complex.
The name “Comment Crew” and “GIF89a” has been used by
researchers because of the behavior of this group to enclose C&C
commands within comments on HTML pages or hidden within image
files, a technique known as steganography. These indicators have not
been witnessed in the attacks previously listed in this report.
Beyond a likely QinetiQ attack relation, there are a number of other
hostnames that indicate potential attack targets of the “1.php” Group.
Disclosure of other possible victim names is intentionally omitted from
this report.

Section 4: Lessons Learned
A number of lessons can be learned from analyzing incidents within
this intrusion set. In the following section, we will discuss analytical
techniques that enterprises should be adopting, in order to uncover
similar attacks on their organizations.

4.1 Conduct logging and analytics within your environment
This report shows an evolution of the beaconing behavior from the
“1.php” Group. Relying solely on existing signatures of known threats
would not have triggered detections. By identifying transactions that
are anomalous, it is possible to detect previous or recurring incidents,
such as those identified above. Some of the anomalies, which led to the
findings in this report, include:
•

HTTP version 1.0 requests with version 1.1 responses

•

Numerous transactions to an unknown / uncategorized domain
– Some of these transactions were to No-IP dynamic DNS domains

		

• Blocking or heavily monitoring the communication to dynamic
DNS domains is recommended

– Some of these domains were parked
– Transactions occur during non-standard times (nights / weekends)
– Some transactions (in particular the GET beacons) had a larger 		
request size than response size
•

Microsoft IE 6 user-agent (UA) string usage in an environment that
does not typically use this UA

Alleged APT Intrusion Set: “1.php” Group

By leveraging data sources such as passive DNS, domain registration
information, other open-source reports, and other research - it is possible
to derive information about probable domains and infrastructure used,
in other attacks by the same group of attackers. In some cases, this
information may provide indicators as to the targets or purpose of the
attacks. It should also be noted that making too many assumptions or
believing unverified indicators as fact can lead to misleading information.
Anyone can set a hostname for a C&C to be “QINETIQ” for example.
However, by correlating these domains with a group that has been
identified as being involved in APT attacks, provides a stronger indication
into their possible target.

“

4.2 Correlate with other sources

-Zscaler ThreatLabZ

4.3 APTs are not always that ‘Advanced’
The above incident reports document (spear-) phishing with a malicious
PDF attachment, or link to a binary executable with a Poison Ivy RAT
payload. While the exploitation used in some of the crafted PDF
attachments may be considered advanced, for the most part the attack is
one of social-engineering. This is nothing new and something that other
fraudsters / criminals have been leveraging for many years. RSA recently
wrapped up their APT summit and their first finding concluded that the
“attack vector [is] shifting from technology to people”.12

4.4 APTs are not limited to the United States Government
or Defense Industrial Base
The victim related to this report is neither a Government agency, nor
an entity that would normally be associated with the Defense Industrial
Base. While this report does list USG (United State Government) and
DIB (Defense Industrial Base) entities as possible victims, there are many
more commercial entities within the Geospatial and Telecommunication
industries that appear to have been victims of this Group. Zscaler has
noted both foreign and domestic entities that have been victims of other
APT incidents as well.

4.5 APT Information Disclosure Remains a Challenge
Incident Information Disclosure is an extension to the heated debate
around vulnerability information disclosure, and full-disclosure versus
responsible-disclosure. Responsible-disclosure is fairly well defined and
adopted within the vulnerability space, but it is not within the incident
space.
Here are some arguments for “full disclosure” of incident information:
• A larger community of awareness (and thus potential detection
possibility), particularly if there are more organizations impacted
• A general philosophy that information should be public and that the
Government or information security community should not have
secrets kept from the public
• The public should be made aware of which organizations have been
victimized so that this information and their response can be weighed
before trusting them again in the future
Here are some arguments for “responsible disclosure” (the
selective release of information to specific parties) of incident information
• Public release will cause the attacker to alter their TTPs and possibly
allow them to make changes to infected systems prior to incident
response action, making detection more difficult
• Public release of information can be viewed as attempting to garner
the spotlight for financial motives versus genuine concerns about
security
• There may be law enforcement (or other) investigations that are
on-going and such a release of information could compromise the
investigation
Zscaler adheres to the following general principals for incident/
vulnerability disclosure:
• Customer specific information is disclosed only to the impacted
customer

© 2011 Zscaler. All Rights Reserved.

Page 15

Alleged APT Intrusion Set: “1.php” Group

• Customer information will be redacted prior to public disclosure
or disclosure to other impacted parties, stake-holders, and trusted
groups within the information security community
• Public disclosure will provide high-level indicators of compromise
(such as general network behavior and malicious domains) without
the release of specifics as to which organizations were impacted and
is done so when it is believed that such information will benefit others
in protecting against similar threats
• Based on feedback/approval from the impacted parties, stake-holders,
and information security community – additional information may be
released to the public
Zscaler is willing to share additional details of the incidents discussed
in this report with trusted groups within the information security
community to help further their research with regard to similar incidents.
If you are interested in sharing data on this and other incidents, we
encourage you to contact us at threatlabz@zscaler.com.

Conclusion
By interrogating Zscaler’s comprehensive logging repository for
anomalous activity and indicators of compromise, a Zscaler ThreatLabZ
researcher identified a high-risk entity victimized by a possible APT attack
linked to the “1.php” Group. The conclusion that these attacks should be
classified as an APT attack are based on the following indicators:
• The victim enterprise is a high risk target, involved in an industry that
has regularly been targeted in similar attacks
• Linkages were identified among several previous incidents from 2010
to present, showing persistence
• There remains little to no open-source information on the domains /
IPs used in the attack, and the linkage to open-source reports shows a
correlation with past APT incidents

APT incidents
• Some No-IP dynamic DNS domains used (while a weak APT indicator,
dynamic DNS domains have often been used among documented APT
incidents, such as Aurora and Night Dragon)
• Hostnames related to victims are used, which is a technique
previously documented in other APT attacks
• Nameserver and domain registration information indicates likely
Chinese origin of attacks
• VPS/hosting servers used match some of those previously used in
alleged APT attacks.
The sum of these indicators has led to our conclusion that this was

an attack performed over a significant period of time that focused on
a specific target, given the sensitive nature of their work. Based on
information in the public domain, it appears that these attacks correlate
with others, previously identified as being the work of the “1.php”
Group. Identified targets of these attacks include China/US relations
experts, USG / DIB entities, and the Geospatial industry. Based on
the targets, it is our belief that corporate espionage was the goal of
the attacks. Open-source reports suggest that these attacks are more
widespread than many realize and that the same or similar actors
are compromising numerous organizations in order to steal sensitive
intellectual property. As stated within the Lessons Learned section, it
is important that those concerned about such attacks be vigilant in their
log collection and analysis to identify anomalies or other indications of
compromise.
