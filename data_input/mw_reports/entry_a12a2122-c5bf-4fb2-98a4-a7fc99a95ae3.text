UPDATE: Premera Latest Healthcare Insurance Agency to be Breached
[http://www.threatconnect.com/news/premera-latest-healthcare-insuranceagency-to-be-breached?utm_campaign=Anthem-Hack-BlogPost&utm_source=from-anthem-post]
When news of the Anthem breach was reported on February 4th, 2015, the
security industry quite understandably went wild. A breach of this
magnitude was certainly unprecedented. Naturally, many industry
professionals were keenly interested in digging into this incident to see what
could be uncovered, and the research team at ThreatConnect was no
exception. Thanks to our powerful API
[http://www.threatconnect.com/product/threatconnect_API] and third-party
partner [http://www.threatconnect.com/partners] integrations, we were
able to use ThreatConnect to quickly uncover a wealth of intelligence even

when initially hindered by a relative lack of investigative lead information
and context, a key requirement of any Threat Intelligence Platform

[http://www.threatconnect.com/why_threat_connect/what_is_threat_intelligence_platform
(TIP). However, before we delve into what we were able to uncover, let’s
briefly review the facts as they stood in the wake of the initial discovery
announcement.

What We Know:

account/]
On the morning of February 4th, 2015, several major
news outlets broke the story
[http://www.wsj.com/articles/health-insurer-anthem-hitby-hackers-1423103720] that Anthem, Inc.’s network
defenses had been breached. According to a statement
from Anthem’s CEO [https://www.anthemfacts.com/ceo]
, the company fell victim to a “very sophisticated external
cyber attack,” and the hackers “obtained” the personally
identifiable information (PII) of approximately 80M
customers. This included social security numbers,
birthdays, street addresses, phone numbers and income
data – plenty of information to enable identity theft. This
was a significant event for several reasons:
 Anthem, formerly known as Wellpoint, is the largest managed healthcare
company in the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, and by extension, one
of the largest healthcare organizations in the United States. As such, any
compromise, no matter how insignificant, would likely impact countless
individuals.

 Blue Cross Blue Shield provides healthcare coverage for about half the
U.S. federal workforce. This means that their information was potentially
compromised too.

 Unlike the Sony hack which was destructive in nature and meant to send
a message for coercive purposes, the Anthem compromise was
purportedly very covert, a fact which may suggest something about the
adversary’s motives.

 As of late February 2015, there have not been any indications that the
exfiltrated PII data was immediately commoditized on the black market
for the purpose of enabling identity theft, as was the case in the Home
Depot Breach.

Filling the Gaps:
Obviously, these high-level observations do not provide cybersecurity

researchers a great deal of information to work with. However, when
presented within the context of a Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP), an
incomplete trail of evidence can highlight intelligence gaps, a study of which
can orient threat researchers towards their analytic objectives. To this end,
let’s examine what we wanted to discover in the context of the Anthem
breach:

 Who was responsible for the attack?
 What was the objective of the attack? Was it cyber theft, an espionage
operation, or something different?

 Who was targeted in the attack? The answer to this question, obscured as
it may be, would likely shed some light on the objective of the breach.

 What was the timeline of the activity?
The real power of a Threat Intelligence Platform is demonstrated when you
are able to collect and maintain a robust dataset of threat indicators, both
past and present, which can help orient you in the right direction in the
wake of a newly discovered breach. Even when you do not have a good deal
of information to start with (for example a file hash, or an IP address), you
may find leads by pivoting through archived datasets until you uncover key
pieces of the puzzle. In the case of the Anthem breach, we were able to do
just that.

Anthem Themed Infrastructure &
Signed Malware:
In September 2014, the ThreatConnect Research Team

[http://threatconnect.com/why_threat_connect/threatconnect_intelligence_research_tea
observed a variant of the Derusbi APT malware family, MD5:
0A9545F9FC7A6D8596CF07A59F400FD3

[https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/77421106548e69e9666c538ad628918cad7cfcf8f6aa7
, which was signed by a valid digital signature from the Korean company
DTOPTOOLZ Co. Derusbi is a family of malware used by multiple actor
groups but associated exclusively with Chinese APT. ThreatConnect
Research began tracking the DTOPTOOLZ signature for additional signed
https://www.threatconnect.com/the-anthem-hack-all-roads-lead-to-china/

4/25

2016/3/3

The Anthem Hack: All Roads Lead to China - ThreatConnect | Enterprise Threat Intelligence Platform

malware samples and memorialized them within our Threat Intelligence
Platform over time.

Analyst Comment: The DTOPTOOLZ signature has also been observed in
association with Korean Adware that is affiliated with the actual
DTOPTOOLZ Co. This adware should not be confused with the APT malware
that is abusing the same digital signature.
Later, in mid-November we discovered another implant that was digitally
signed with the DTOPTOOLZ signature. This implant, MD5:
98721c78dfbf8a45d152a888c804427c

[https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/8d168092d5601ebbaed24ec3caeef7454c48cf21366c
, was from the “Sakula” (aka. Sakurel) family of malware, a known variant of
the Derusbi backdoor, and was configured to communicate with the
malicious command and control (C2) domains extcitrix.we11point[.]com and
www.we11point[.]com. Through our Farsight Security passive DNS
[http://www.threatconnect.com/news/press-releases/cyber-squared-incannounces-expansion-data-services-powerful-domain-passive-dnsintelligence/] integration, we uncovered that this malicious infrastructure
was likely named in such a way to impersonate the legitimate Wellpoint IT
infrastructure.
Passive DNS and historic DomainTools Whois data also provided insights
that helped establish an initial timeline dating back to April 2014, when the
faux domains came into existence and were later operationalized by the
attackers. A Threat Intelligence Platform should allow for analysts to easily
put together and organize such insights, collaborate around relevant
analysis internally, and share the finished analysis with external industry
groups and organizations. In the hopes that our community members could
benefit from or provide further insight into this suspicious incident, we
immediately shared our threat intelligence including indicators, signatures
and analytical context to the ThreatConnect Medical and Health Community
[http://www.threatconnect.com/news/threatconnect-enables-healthynetworking-biomed-life-sciences-industry/] on November 13, 2014. This
included sending out a notification to all stakeholders as well as our
followers on Twitter [https://twitter.com/threatconnect] .
When the Anthem breach later came to light in early February, we re-shared
https://www.threatconnect.com/the-anthem-hack-all-roads-lead-to-china/

5/25

2016/3/3

The Anthem Hack: All Roads Lead to China - ThreatConnect | Enterprise Threat Intelligence Platform

the signatures, indicators and context freely to the entire ThreatConnect
user base. As we dug further, we expanded our understanding of the
malicious we11point[.]com infrastructure, taking particular interest to the
subdomains such as “extcitrix.we11point[.]com and
“hrsolutions.we11point[.]com”. Note the “citrix” and “hr” (human resources)
prefixes that the adversary used to mirror legitimate remote infrastructure
and employee benefits resources in the May 2014 timeframe. This provided
initial insights as to the likely targeting themes and or vectors in which the
adversary may have used when initiating their targeting campaign.

[http://www.threatconnect.com/wpcontent/uploads/2015/12/wellpoint-evil2legit1.jpg]
The fact that the malicious infrastructure closely mirrored other legitimate
Wellpoint infrastructure supported our hypothesis that the Derusbi / Sakula
malware was configured to operate and persist within a specific target
enterprise.

Possible Premera Blue Cross
Infrastructure:
Retrospective analysis of other targeted malware samples using the
DTOPTOOLZ Co. digital signature led to the identification of an
“HttpBrowser” / “HttpDump” implant MD5:
02FAB24461956458D70AEED1A028EB9C

[https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/3fe208273288fc4d8db1bf20078d550e321d9bc5b9ab
(OpenOfficePlugin.exe), which was first observed on December 11, 2013.
Although this malware sample is not Derusbi / Sakula, it too is strongly
https://www.threatconnect.com/the-anthem-hack-all-roads-lead-to-china/

6/25

2016/3/3

The Anthem Hack: All Roads Lead to China - ThreatConnect | Enterprise Threat Intelligence Platform

believed to be associated with Chinese APT activity and in fact may have also
been involved in a Blue Cross Blue Shield targeting campaign as early as
December 2013.

[http://www.threatconnect.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/premeraupdate.jpg]
This particular binary is configured to connect to the static IP address
142.91.76[.]134. Passive DNS of this IP indicates that on December 11th,
2013, the same date as the malware sample was observed, the domain
prennera[.]com also resolved to 142.91.76[.]134. It is believed that the
prennera[.]com domain may have been impersonating the Healthcare
provider Premera Blue Cross [http://www.premera.com] , where the
attackers used the same character replacement technique by replacing the
“m” with two “n” characters within the faux domain, the same technique that
would be seen five months later with the we11point[.]com command and
control infrastructure.

Section Summary:
 The Derusbi / Sakula malware implant types are unique in that they have
traditionally been seen within Chinese APT espionage campaigns.

 The “HttpBrowser” / “HttpDump” malware implant (while a different family
of malware than Derusbi / Sakula) is also believed to be of Chinese origin,
and was also digitally signed with the DTOPTOOLZ digitalsignature. This
implant connected to a C2 node that overlapped with prennera[.]com.

 We believe that the prennera[.]com domain may be impersonating
Premera Blue Cross (premera.com), using a similar character replacement
technique seen in the we11point[.]com campaign.

VAE Inc. Themed Infrastructure &
Signed Malware
Another powerful attribute of ThreatConnect is the ability for analysts to
logically group items such as atomic indicators, related documents or
signatures, all of which may include individualized custom context
enrichments and associations. Over time, the ability to memorialize
groupings of related or like activity allows analysts to quickly uncover nonobvious relationships within their private datasets. This is exactly what
happened as we continued to investigate these incidents.
As industry analysts and media speculated Chinese APT involvement
[http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/investigators-suspectchina-may-be-responsible-for-hack-of-anthem/2015/02/05/25fbb36e-ad5611e4-9c91-e9d2f9fde644_story.html] in the Anthem breach, our focus into
the Derusbi / Sakula malware signed with the DTOPTOOLZ Co. digital
signature shifted from the we11point[.]com incident to another cluster of
activity that occurred later in May 2014. We immediately reviewed Incident
20140526B: vaeit APT
[https://app.threatconnect.com/tc/auth/incident/incident.xhtml?
incident=708926] , an incident that we initially shared to our Subscriber
Community on September 29, 2014 after conducting retrospective analysis.

2016/3/3

The Anthem Hack: All Roads Lead to China - ThreatConnect | Enterprise Threat Intelligence Platform

[http://www.threatconnect.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Well-VAEOverlaps.jpg]
Just as was the case with the we11point[.]com and prennera[.]com
incidents, the VAE, Inc. incident is also believed to be associated with
Chinese APT espionage activity. In this case the adversary also used Derusbi
/ Sakula malware that was signed with the DTOPTOOLZ Co. digital signature
and configured to communicate with faux infrastructure appearing to be
masquerading as internal resources for the Department of Defense
Contractor VAE, Inc. Additionally, in response to an inquiry from
KrebsOnSecurity, VAE, Inc. would later confirm
[http://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/02/anthem-breach-may-have-started-inapril-2014/] that it had indeed been a target of a failed spearphishing
attempt in May 2014 which used the malicious faux VAE, Inc. themed
domain.
The targeted incident relied upon the Sakula executable MD5:
230D8A7A60A07DF28A291B13DDF3351F

[https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/d4be6c9117db9de21138ae26d1d0c3cfb38fd7a19fa0
which had a XOR 0x9A encoded C2 callbacks to the IP address
192.199.254[.]126 (registered to Wehostwebsites[.]com – “Tom Yu” of Baoan,
https://www.threatconnect.com/the-anthem-hack-all-roads-lead-to-china/

9/25

The Anthem Hack: All Roads Lead to China - ThreatConnect | Enterprise Threat Intelligence Platform

Shenzhen City, Guangdong Province, China) as well as a hardcoded callback
to sharepoint-vaeit[.]com. Passive DNS of the static C2 IP 192.199.254[.]126
revealed a single suspicious domain of interest – topsec2014[.]com. This
domain had historic resolution around May 8, 2014 within a month of the
first observed Sakula activity using the IP 192.199.254[.]126 as C2.

[http://www.threatconnect.com/wpcontent/uploads/2015/12/li-regoverlaps1.jpg]
Using historic Whois, we discovered that topsec2014[.]com was initially
registered by li2384826402@yahoo[.]com on May 6th, 2014. Although the
li2384826402@yahoo[.]com registrant is likely a reseller given that it has
been observed registering several thousands of other domains, the fact that
it was used to register both the faux VAE, Inc. C2 infrastructure and the
overlapping domain topsec2014[.]com within the same month suggests that
there may be a relationship between the client of the reseller for the VAE,
Inc. infrastructure and the client for topsec2014[.]com.

The Anthem Hack: All Roads Lead to China - ThreatConnect | Enterprise Threat Intelligence Platform

[http://www.threatconnect.com/wpcontent/uploads/2015/12/topsec2014-hist.png]
Just four minutes after the initial registration of topsec2014[.]com, the
Whois records were updated from the initial registrant, Li Ning –
li2384826402@yahoo[.]com to TopSec China – TopSec_2014@163[.]com.
This domain record has been unchanged since May 7th 2014. The
we11point[.]com infrastructure and by extension the faux VAE Inc.
infrastructure is associated with Cluster 2 of the ScanBox framework
[http://pwc.blogs.com/files/cto-tib-20150223-01a.pdf] by PwC. The latest
PwC update to ScanBox states that there are “links between the domain

allegedly used in the Anthem hack (we11point.com) to Cluster 2 through
shared WHOIS details.”

OPM Themed Infrastructure
One notable pattern was how the domain Whois registration information
for the VAE, Inc. themed infrastructure was quickly updated and obfuscated
with pseudorandom 10 character gmx.com email addresses and using the
names of various comic book characters from the Iron Man franchise. This
comic-themed naming convention has been previously documented by our
friends at Crowdstrike [http://blog.crowdstrike.com/ironman-deep-pandauses-sakula-malware-target-organizations-multiple-sectors/] in what they
characterize as being associated with a Chinese APT group they have
dubbed “Deep Panda”.
Leveraging our DomainTools partnership, we were able to correlate the
outlier domain opm-learning[.]org. This domain was also purportedly
registered by the Iron Man movie hero “Tony Stark” on July 28, 2014. This
infrastructure naming convention suggests a possible Office of Personnel
Management (OPM) theme. However, in this case we lacked any specific
sample of malware to verify our initial suspicions that this infrastructure
was operational. The possible OPM reference in the domain name is
noteworthy considering it was revealed in July of 2014 that OPM had been
compromised [http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/nationalsecurity/chinese-hackers-go-after-us-workers-personaldata/2014/07/10/92db92e8-0846-11e4-8a6a-19355c7e870a_story.html] by a

11/25

The Anthem Hack: All Roads Lead to China - ThreatConnect | Enterprise Threat Intelligence Platform

likely state-sponsored Chinese actor in mid-March of that year. The fact this
domain was registered after the breach occurred suggests that OPM could
be an ongoing direct target of Chinese state-sponsored cyber espionage
activity.
Our attention then turned to the FBI Flash Report A-000049-MW
[http://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/FBI-FlashWarning-Deep-Panda.pdf] that was publicly reported by Brian Krebs
[http://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/02/china-to-blame-in-anthem-hack/] on
February 6th, 2015. This FBI Flash Report was issued on January 27th, 2015,
the same day an Anthem administrator detected suspicious activity
according to an internal memo
[http://www.csoonline.com/article/2880352/disaster-recovery/anthemconfirms-data-breach-but-full-extent-remains-unknown.html] . This memo
goes on to indicate that the FBI would not be party to the Anthem breach
until they were notified on January 29th, 2015; based on these facts we
assess with high confidence that it is very unlikely that the FBI Flash Report
was directly related to the Anthem breach. Rather, we suspect that the FBI
flash report likely references the USIS breach that was announced
[http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/dhs-contractorsuffers-major-computer-breach-officials-say/2014/08/06/8ed131b4-1d8911e4-ae54-0cfe1f974f8a_story.html] on August 6, 2014, or the previous OPM
breach, considering the statement that the breach involved “compromised

and stolen sensitive business information and Personally Identifiable
Information (PII) from US commercial and government networks through
cyber espionage.”
The malware referenced within the FBI Report is associated with a Derusbi
backdoor subvariant named “InfoAdmin” / “Kakfum” where the FBI
specifically references open source reporting of “Deep Panda” as being
related to the malware observed in the attack. The malicious infrastructure
highlighted in the report are the domains images.googlewebcache[.]com
and smtp.outlookssl[.]com. Both of these top level domains were included
with other related domains, all of which were shared on September 16th,
2013 to the ThreatConnect Subscriber Community in Incident 20130823C:
Some.Trouble APT Domains

The Anthem Hack: All Roads Lead to China - ThreatConnect | Enterprise Threat Intelligence Platform

incident=39083] , roughly a year and half prior to the FBI Flash report.
It is important to mention that both the domains
images.googlewebcache[.]com and smtp.outlookssl[.]comas were also
previously identified in an October 2014 PwC blog post
[http://pwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2014/10/scanbox-frameworkwhos-affected-and-whos-using-it-1.html] as seen within Cluster 1 of the
Scanbox framework, while the Sakula activity with we11point and VAEIT is
contained within Cluster 2 of that report. This implies that the actor
referenced within the FBI Flash report uses shared capabilities (in this case
the ScanBox kit) with the Sakula / we11point actor.

Section Summary:
 The Derusbi / Sakula malware seen in both the we11point[.]com and VAE
Inc. campaigns were structurally the same and digitally signed with the
DTOPTOOLZ signature.

 The emerging theme is that this particular signature and family of
malware is highly indicative of a particular Chinese APT activity.

 Within this web of malicious infrastructure, there is an interesting overlap
with the topsec2014[.]com domain and attack infrastructure.

 ThreatConnect Research identified a domain opm-learning[.]org that had
a similar superhero themed WHOIS registrant to the Sakula / VAE Inc.
infrastructure. The possible OPM reference is noteworthy considering the
Office of Personnel Management (OPM) was compromised in March 2014.
Additionally, an FBI Flash Report 0000-49MW referenced indicators that
were possibly associated with the USIS hack and a Derusbi variant called
“Kakfum” / “InfoAdmin”. Both the FBI Flash infrastructure and the Sakula /
VAE Inc. infrastructure are tied to the capability usage of the ScanBox
framework, residing in Clusters 1 and 2 respectively.

Unveiling Song Yubo and Southeast
University:
The Professor
We conducted open source research in pursuit of further information on the
TopSec_2014@163[.]com email registrant. A keyword search returned

The Anthem Hack: All Roads Lead to China - ThreatConnect | Enterprise Threat Intelligence Platform

several results for “topsec2014@163[.]com” in association with a number of
academic institutions in Nanjing, China. Although the email address wasn’t
an exact match to the topsec2014[.]com domain registrant (notice the
absence of the underscore), such a similarity warranted further
investigation.

[http://www.threatconnect.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot2015-02-25-at-5.20.37-PM.png]
We examined the links for any relevant intelligence, and discovered that
nearly all of the search results led to pages that contained an
announcement for an information security competition sponsored by the
Southeast University-Topsec Information Security and Mobile Internet

Technology Joint Research Center. This entity appears to be a joint research
venture between the University and Chinese networking giant Beijing
Topsec Network Security Technology Co., a.k.a. Beijing Topsec.

[http://www.threatconnect.com/

The announcements list a Professor “Song Yubo” as the point of contact for
the event, and directs interested parties to his email address,
topsec2014@163[.]com, for further questions.

[http://www.threatconnect.com/wpcontent/uploads/2015/12/Translation.png]
According to his LinkedIn page, Song is a Teacher at the Southeast
University, specifically interested in the field of telecommunications.
Additionally, he is an avid researcher, and has published numerous
academic papers on computer network exploitation on various e-journal
publication sites, such as Google Scholar
[https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BoorASIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN] .
Further, he lists skills such as “cryptography,” “penetration testing” and
“computer network security,” etc. on his Research Gate profile
[http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Song_Yubo] .

[http://www.threatconnect.com/wpcontent/uploads/2015/12/yubo-stacked.png]
As we continued to develop a profile on Professor Song, we began to have
the sense that his interest in information security research strongly
overlapped with that of someone who might be interested in or at least
capable of conducting sophisticated cyber attacks. However, interests alone
are not enough to warrant reasonable suspicion, so we had to do more
digging.
Additionally, the soft link between TopSec_2014@163[.]com and
topsec2014@163[.]com alone was not sufficient to make associations with
any reasonable confidence, but as it turns out, Yubo has in fact been
previously named as a person of interest in the context of offensive Chinese
cyber activity.

The University
In March 2012, Northrop Grumman presented a commissioned report to
Congress
[http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB424/docs/Cyber-066.pdf]
detailing Chinese cyber warfare capabilities. The report asserts with high
confidence that both Song and the Information Security Research Center at
Southeast University have received numerous state-sponsored research
grants, and by extension, cooperated with the Government of China in
conducting information security research and development (R&D). As
https://www.threatconnect.com/the-anthem-hack-all-roads-lead-to-china/

16/25

The Anthem Hack: All Roads Lead to China - ThreatConnect | Enterprise Threat Intelligence Platform

stated on Southeast University’s own website, the main purpose of these
grants are to develop technical acumen amongst its students via providing
support for “state-owned scientific research institutions, state key
enterprises, government agencies and People’s Liberation Army (PLA) units.”

[http://www.threatconnect.com/wpcontent/uploads/2015/12/relationships.jpg]
Southeast University is one of only three Chinese academic institutes that
receives funding from all five of the State grant programs. Song himself has
also conducted his fair share of state-sponsored research, notably under
the National Ministry of State Security 115 Program – a highly sensitive
research grant to fund ambiguous information warfare R&D, almost
certainly in support of PLA programs.

The Competition
As we can see, the evidence continued to stack up. The real smoking gun,
however, was when we began to notice a strong temporal overlap with the
various stages of the TOPSEC Cup that Song and Beijing Topsec were
organizing, and the registration dates of malicious infrastructure as well as
the malware compilation dates.

[http://www.threatconnect.com/wpcontent/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-02-26-at4.12.20-PM.png]
Based upon the translated registration form that we obtained from Song
Yubo’s personal Baidu document sharing account, open registration for the
“TOPSEC Cup” began on May 4th, 2014 and would close on May 14th, 2014.
The details of the competition that were shared on the announcement are
extremely ambiguous, and probably for good reason. The introductory
paragraph mentions that the primary goal of the event is to facilitate the
training and discovery of new talent, noting that exceptional participants
would receive priority consideration for internships and jobs with Beijing
Topsec.
The event itself was broken down into several distinct rounds of
competition. Firstly, the preliminary round required that all eligible
registrants would attempt to remotely access and navigate through the
network. Should a participating team perform exceptionally in the
preliminary qualifying round, they would be invited to participate in the
final round on-site in Nanjing.
In this final round, participants would be required to build their own
“information systems and network environments.” The announcement
notes that the students must rely upon their own laptop and software tools
to accomplish this task. Further, the announcement notes that participants
are prohibited from attacking the provided server as well as their
competitors.

The Anthem Hack: All Roads Lead to China - ThreatConnect | Enterprise Threat Intelligence Platform

Section Summary:
 Song Yubo and his research center at Southeast University appear to be
central players in this narrative, as highlighted by their financial
connections to the government of China, in particular the Ministry of State
Security (MSS), China’s premier human intelligence agency.

 If the MSS was involved, we can deduce that the Anthem hack could have
been for the purposes of gathering sensitive information for followon HUMINT targeting via blackmail, asset recruitment or technical
targeting operations against individuals at home.

 Song’s use of the topsec email alias suggests a greater association w/
TOPSEC.

 It seems as if the competition is almost certainly the cause for the
topsec2014[.]com domain. What is very curious, however, is the initial
registration by the reseller li2384826402@yahoo[.]com, which is a tactic
seen within the confirmed malicious faux VAE Inc.infrastructure.

 The overlap between the competition website and the static command
and control infrastructure seen in the Derusbi / Sakula implant is was
likely an error made by the attackers.

Tianrongxin, a.k.a. Beijing Topsec
Technology Co:
The Company
To enhance our open-source capabilities, we partnered up with Dr. James
Mulvenon [http://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Mulvenon_Bio.pdf] and
his team of China experts at Defense Group, Inc. (DGI)
[http://www.defensegroupinc.com/index.html] . We shared with them
everything that we knew at the time, walking through the technical details
which led us all the way to Song Yubo and the competition announcement.
From there, they were able to uncover a wealth of very consequential
background information on Beijing Topsec Technology Co (Beijing Topsec),
the sponsoring organization for Song Yubo’s information security
competition.
DGI’s research indicated that Beijing Topsec is one of the largest information

security hardware providers in China. In 1996, they were the first Chinese
company to break into the market with the release of China’s first
indigenously-manufactured firewall. Since then, they have expanded their
business to include a consulting practice focused on issues such as
vulnerability mining, software code analysis, threat intelligence, and
encryption R&D, amongst other things.
The company served as a core technical support unit for network security at
the 2008 Olympic Games – an event which was tightly controlled by the
state. Additionally, Beijing Topsec is a known partner of the Chinese
military. Since 2009, the company has possessed information publication
credentials for military network procurement. Since 2013, they have been
publicly recognized as the Chinese equivalent of a cleared defense
contractor.
The links between Beijing Topsec and the Chinese government are fairly
substantial, highlighted by long-standing partnerships between even the
most shadowy elements of the Chinese military.

The Leaked Cable
A very compelling piece of evidence is found in the contents of a leaked
2009 diplomatic security cable from the Department of State, published by
The Guardian. [http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cablesdocuments/214462] The cable is a daily digest of Diplomatic Security alerts
– essentially a situational awareness primer for State Department
employees to inform them of new and existing threats. In one section, the
cable highlights that the Founder of Beijing Topsec, He Weidong, had openly
talked about receiving directives from the PLA in an interview with China
News Network. In the interview, the founder quite curiously states that
Topsec is less a commercial entity, but rather a research institute, and that
the company received about half of its start-up capital directly from the PLA.
The cable further claims that Topsec actively recruits for the PLA cyber
army.

It would also appear that not only does Beijing Topsec have deep ties to
state-run cyber activity, but also within the independent hacker community
as well. Of note, the company hired the notorious hacker Lin Yong, a.k.a.
“Lion” (of the Honker Union of China
[http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2011/10/05/patriotic-chinese-hackinggroup-reboots/] ) in the early 2000s as a security service engineer and to
conduct network training.

Section Summary:
 It is not surprising that the Chinese government would be interested
in partnering with a private organization such as Beijing Topsec for use as
a front for state-sponsored activity.

 The association between Southeast University and Beijing Topsec as
manifested in the joint information security research center highlights the
possibility of growing links between state-sponsored activity and
academic institutions, particularly those that receive funding from the
central government.

 All in all, it would seem that China is pursuing a unified approach to cyber
operations, relying on all unique facets of the workforce: academia,
private industry, and independent hackers, as well as the PLA to achieve
their strategic goals.

Conclusion:
The Anthem breach exposes the insidious reality of modern Chinese cyber
espionage as it continues its unrelenting strikes at the soft underbelly of the
American way of life. Moreover, it demonstrates the imposing yet

increasingly common reality of conducting threat intelligence analysis
without substantial threat intelligence to start with. Fortunately for us, we
were able to deduce informed answers to some of the outstanding
questions to this breach by scrutinizing our archival data troves that are
efficiently stored within our Threat Intelligence Platform and partner
integrations. In the field of cyber security, industry professionals must learn
to play the long game in order to generate a proactive sense of situational
awareness, allowing for greater efficiency and flexibility in mitigating future
threats.
Additionally, this incident underscores the frustrating disparity of the
industry when it comes to naming conventions. With so many threat actors
and indicators floating around, it is can be frustrating to keep track of all the
disparate pieces of evidence, especially when countless naming conventions
are applied. Without the use of a Threat Intelligence Platform to keep track
of the flood of incoming threat data, this task would be extraordinarily time
consuming at best and crippling at worst.
Moving forward, it is important to bear in mind that the adversary,
regardless of country of origin, shall almost certainly leverage our every
weakness against us. Even something as seemingly innocuous as confusion
over names can easily consume analytical bandwidth, creating a window of
opportunity to strike. We – that is security professionals, private industry
and governments alike – must proactively harden our network defenses and
hasten our incident responses as a united, synchronous entity.
We have shared details on Song Yubo

Common Community. This share also includes the full-text DGI “BLUE
HERON” research
[https://app.threatconnect.com/tc/auth/document/document.xhtml?
document=726190] which provides greater insight into Song Yubo,
Southeast University and Beijing Topsec.
All things considered, industry must learn to adopt a cooperative defense
mindset in the hopes of rebuffing future attacks. The most resolute defense
we have is each other, so be like ThreatConnect Research and start actively
