When the 7th July indictment was released naming two Chinese hackers affiliated with the
Guangdong State Security Department, it grabbed our interest. Hackers… in China…working
with the MSS. Sounds right up our street. But who are Li Xiaoyu (李啸宇) and Dong Jiazhi
(董家志)? How do they conduct their activity? The indictment also mentions an unnamed
MSS Officer 1. Who could this be? Let’s start with the named hackers…

Former classmates, Li Xiaoyu and Dong Jiazhi studied Computer Application Technologies
at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in Chengdu. Mr
Dong and Mr Li are not individuals we have come across before in our investigations into
Chinese APTs. However, we do love a challenge. So, we set about getting to work and
decided to start in the city Li and Dong are based: Chengdu.
Our findings reveal a number of spurious science and technology companies linked to the
indicted actors. A familiar pattern is once again emerging…

Chengdu Shirun Technology Company Ltd (成都诗润科技有限公司)
Let’s start with Dong Jiazhi. There is very little to go on from the indictment. However, we
know Chinese APTs follow a common blueprint: One of contract hackers and specialists,
front companies and an intelligence officer.
We know Mr Li and Mr Dong are the contract hackers. So we set about digging into their
connections to front companies based in Chengdu.
It turns out Dong has been investing in a company called Chengdu Shirun Technology
Company Ltd. Specifically, 30,000RMB came from Dong, who invested in the company when
it was registered. This roughly equates to $4,5000 or £3,500.

Registrant of Chengdu Shirun Technology Company Ltd: Dong Jiazhi
A deeper look into this company reveals its location is 16 Tongsheng Rd, Qingyang District,
Chengdu. It also provides a contact number: 18828070461.

Interestingly, this is not the only company that is linked to this contact number. It seems a
number of other companies in Chengdu also share this point of contact.

Chengdu Hanke Technology Company Ltd. (成都撼科科技有限公司)
This company shares the same contact number as Chengdu Shirun but lists this as an email
contact (18828070461@139.com). Additional contact numbers (18980738906 and
18190696626) are also provided.

Contact details for Chengdu Hanke Technology Company Ltd.
Even more interesting is the change record for the company. Prior to 2019, Dong Jiazhi was
listed as the company contact.

Change record for Chengdu Hanke listing Dong Jiazhi on line 3
Chengdu Hanke doesn’t have much of a presence. The website domain
51409903.1024sj.com does not exist. However, we did come across a LinkedIn profile for
someone who claims to be the project manager and lead programmer – a Kevin Lynx.
Further digging did not reveal anything more on this person or the company. Kevin, if you are
out there – feel free to get in touch…

Chengdu Xinglan Technology Company Ltd. (成都兴蓝科技有限公司)
It seems 18828070461 is a theme. The number from Shirun and the 139 email from Hanke
was also used to register another Chengdu-based technology company: Chengdu Xinglan.
So who is behind this company? Well, as we mentioned, it shares contact details with
companies linked to Dong. And Mr Dong is mentioned as the company’s primary point of
contact.

Company registration details listing Dong Jiazhi as a contact person for Chengdu Xinglan on
line 2.
Furthermore, records show Li Xiaoyu as Chengdu Xinglan’s legal representative, CEO and
Executive Director, having a 99% stake in the company. It seems the pair intertwined at
University, and expanded together into their business ventures and criminal activity
concealed by front companies based in Chengdu.

legal representative.

Li and Dong haven’t learnt to mix things up – reusing the same email number for their
multiple front companies.
And once again, this number (18828070461) was used as the registrant contact number for
a domain: ‘chengdulzy.com’.
The registrant of this domain? Dong Jiazhi. Unfortunately, we haven’t found out what this
domain was used for, and it now appears to have been deleted.

Chengdu’s many Science and Technology companies
We are finding a similar pattern to previous investigations. An overlap of numbers and emails
linking to contract hackers (Dong and Li), and subsequently to a number of technology
companies based in Chengdu. All with little to no online presence suggests – you guessed it
– front companies.
However, what about the individuals themselves? They clearly have been busy investing in,
and creating multiple technology businesses within Chengdu to act as fronts for their hacking
activity. But what else have they left on the internet for us to find?

Oro0lxy
The handle used by Li, and named in the indictment provides a helpful starting point. A quick
scan of the internet shows various accounts with this handle, most now defunct or empty but
the majority pertaining to hacking forums, such as the Chinese Software Developers Network
8/10

(CSDN).
It seems oro0lxy has had a long standing interest in ColdFusion, using this knowledge
(according to the indictment) to develop vulnerabilities in support of his APT activity.

oro0lxy posts question on CSDN ColdFusion sub forum
In keeping with his interest in this vulnerability, Li was appointed moderator of a website for
ColdFusion developers, CFwindow.com, in 2012.
However, oro0lxy was later flagged for posting scams on CSDN.

QQ account links
Looking into Li and Dong’s QQ accounts, we attempted to identify their actions and any
overlaps that were interesting or of note. According to leaked databases, QQ 3120988 was
associated with the display name Li Xiaoyu, whilst QQ 191956463 had historically used the
username Dong Jiazhi.
We also pulled out a number of QQ groups that crossed the two hackers profiles. Specifically
their QQ accounts linking to university groups such as ‘Class of 2005, Class 5’ (2005 级5
班),‘Information Security Lab’ (信息安全实验室) and ‘Computer Applications Technology
Class 2’ (计算机应用技术 2 班).
These are historic but provide useful context for what we know about the pair. Get in touch
with us if you have any further information or leads pertaining to these accounts.
So… we know that Li and Dong have been indicted as hackers working to the MSS.
Contract hackers – check.
We know that they set up a number of front companies based in Chengdu to shield
their APT activity. Front companies – check.
And we know they have been working together for a number of years, having met at
university and remained active on Chinese hacker forums. But who specifically is
behind their activity with the Guangdong State Security Department? Who is MSS
Officer 1?
Tune in next week to find out…
