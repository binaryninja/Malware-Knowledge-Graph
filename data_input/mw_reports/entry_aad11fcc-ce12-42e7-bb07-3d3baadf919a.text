JhoneRAT: Cloud based python RAT targeting Middle Eastern
countries
blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/01/jhonerat.html

By Warren Mercer, Paul Rascagneres and Vitor Ventura with contributions from Eric Kuhla.
Updated January 17th: the documents do not exploit the CVE-2017-0199 vulnerability.

Executive Summary
Today, Cisco Talos is unveiling the details of a new RAT we have identiﬁed we're calling
"JhoneRAT." This new RAT is dropped to the victims via malicious Microsoft Ofﬁce documents.
The dropper, along with the Python RAT, attempts to gather information on the victim's machine
and then uses multiple cloud services: Google Drive, Twitter, ImgBB and Google Forms. The RAT
attempts to download additional payloads and upload the information gathered during the
reconnaissance phase. This particular RAT attempts to target a very speciﬁc set of Arabicspeaking countries. The ﬁltering is performed by checking the keyboard layout of the infected
systems. Based on the analysed sample, JhoneRAT targets Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Egypt, Libya,
Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Oman, Yemen, Syria, UAE, Kuwait, Bahrain and Lebanon.
What's new? The campaign shows an actor that developed a homemade RAT that works in
multiple layers hosted on cloud providers. JhoneRAT is developed in Python but not based on
public source code, as it is often the case for this type of malware. The attackers put great effort
to carefully select the targets located in speciﬁc countries based on the victim's keyboard layout.
How did it work? Everything starts with a malicious document using a well-known vulnerability to
download a malicious document hosted on the internet. For this campaign, the attacker chose to
use a cloud provider (Google) with a good reputation to avoid URL blacklisting. The malware is

divided into a couple of layers — each layer downloads a new payload on a cloud provider to get
the ﬁnal RAT developed in Python and that uses additional providers such as Twitter and ImgBB.
So what? This RAT is a good example of how a highly focused attack that tries to blend its
network trafﬁc into the crowd can be highly effective. In this campaign, focusing detection of the
network is not the best approach. Instead, the detection must be based on the behaviour on the
operating system. Attackers can abuse well-known cloud providers and abuse their reputations in
order to avoid detection.

Opsec and targeted countries
The fact that this attacker decided to leverage cloud services and four different services — and
not their own infrastructure — is smart from an opsec point of view. It is hard for the targets to
identify legitimate and malicious trafﬁc to cloud provider infrastructure. Moreover, this kind of
infrastructure uses HTTPS and the ﬂow is encrypted that makes man-in-the-middle interception
more complicated for the defender. It is not the ﬁrst time an attacker used only cloud providers.

User-agent #1

User-agent #2

User-agent #3
Even while using these services, the authors of this JhoneRAT went further and used different
user-agent strings depending on the request, and even on the downloaders the authors used

other user-agent strings.
We already published a couple of articles about ROKRAT (here, here, here and here) where
another unrelated actor, Group123, made the same choice but with different providers.
The attacker implemented ﬁltering based on the keyboard's layout.

Keyboard layout check
The malware is executed only for the following layout, the country is based on the Microsoft
website:
'0401' -> Saudi Arabia
'0801' -> Iraq
'0c01' -> Egypt
'1001' -> Libya
'1401' -> Algeria
'1801' -> Morocco
'1c01' -> Tunisia
'2001' -> Oman
'2401' -> Yemen
'2801' -> Syria
'3801' -> UAE
'3401' -> Kuwait
'3c01' -> Bahrain
'3001' -> Lebanon

Malicious documents

Decoy document
We identiﬁed three malicious Microsoft Ofﬁce documents that download and load an additional
Ofﬁce document with a Macro. The oldest one from November 2019, named "Urgent.docx," is
shown below:

The author of the document asks to enable editing in English and in Arabic.
The second document from the beginning of January is named "fb.docx" and contains usernames
and passwords from an alleged "Facebook" leak:

Second decoy document
The more recent document is from mid-January and alleged to be from a United Arab Emirate
organization. The author blurred the content and asks the user to enable editing to see the
content:

Macro loading
In the three documents, an additional Ofﬁce document containing a Macro is downloaded and
executed. The documents are located on Google Drive.

Malicious documents on Google Drive

Infection workﬂow

Stage No. 1: Malicious template on Google Drive
The template located on Google Drive contains a macro. The macro contains a virtual machine
detection technique based on the serial number of the disks available in the victim environment.
Indeed, some VMs do not have serial numbers and the macro is executed only if a serial number
exists. A WMIC command is executed to get this information on the targeted system.

If a serial number exists, the rest of the code is executed. The purpose is to download an image
from a new Google Drive link:

Image download
It is interesting to note that the ﬁlename of the downloaded image is randomly generated based
on a dictionary: Array ("cartoon," "img," "photo"). The ﬁlename will be cartoon.jpg or img.jpg or
photo.jpg and the image usually depicts a cartoon.

Stage No. 2: Image ﬁle on Google Drive
The image ﬁle is a real image with a base64-encoded binary appended at the end.

Image No. 1
The malware author has a curious sense of humor.

Image No. 2
The base64 data and image are separated by the "****" string:

Image and payload separation
The decoded binary ﬁlename is also randomly generated based on a dictionary: Array ("proc",
"chrome", "winrar"). It can be proc.exe or chrome.exe or winrar.exe.

Stage No. 3: Autoit ﬁle
The decoded base64 data is an AutoIT binary. This binary downloads a new ﬁle on Google Drive.

AutoIT downloader
The ﬁlename is also randomly generated based on a dictionary $ARRAY[5]=
["prc","winrar","chrome","sync","COM surr"].

Stage No. 4: Python RAT using cloud providers
The ﬁnal payload is a remote access tool (RAT) written in Python. We named this RAT
"JhoneRAT." The Python code is wrapped into an executable using pyinstaller. It uses minimal
obfuscation applied only on variables and function naming.

RAT startup
The RAT starts by launching three threads. The ﬁrst is responsible for checking if the system has
the targeted keyboard layout — this is exclusively in Arabic-speaking countries. The second will
create the persistence and, ﬁnally, the last one to be started is the main cycle for the RAT. As we
explained before, the RAT targets speciﬁc countries by checking the keyboard's layout. In fact,
this is one of the ﬁrst checks it performs when it is executed. The persistence is achieved by
adding an entry with the name "ChromeUpdater" to the
'Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run' .

This RAT uses three different cloud services to perform all its command and control (C2)
activities. It checks for new commands in the tweets from the handle @jhone87438316
(suspended by Twitter) every 10 seconds using the BeautifulSoup HTML parser to identify new
tweets. These commands can be issued to a speciﬁc victim based on the UID generated on each
target (by using the disk serial and contextual information such as the hostname, the antivirus and
the OS) or to all of them:

Command fetching

Command parsing
The exﬁltration, however, is done via other cloud providers. The screenshots are exﬁltrated via
the ImgBB website:

The remaining commands send feedback by posting data into Google Forms:

Finally, the RAT is able to download ﬁles encoded in base64 on Google Drive:

Feature-wise, the RAT has three commands:
Take a screenshot and upload it to ImgBB.
Download binary disguised has a picture from Google Drive and execute it.
Execute a command and send the output to Google Forms.

Anti-VM, anti-decompiler and no header
The attacker put a couple of tricks in place to avoid execution on virtual machines (sandbox). The
ﬁrst trick is the check of the serial number of the disk. The actor used the same technique in the
macro and in the JhoneRAT. By default, most of the virtual machines do not have a serial number
on the disk.

The attacker used a second trick to avoid analysis of the Python code. The actor used the same
trick that FireEye in the Flare-On 6: Challenge 7: They removed the header of the Python
bytecode. It can be perfectly executed without the header, but tools such as uncompyle6 need
this header:
$ uncompyle6 ﬁnal2
ImportError: Unknown magic number 227 in ﬁnal2
Additionally, the generated code by uncompyle6 varies depending on the version and the impact
is important.
Here is a condition generated with uncompyle6 version 3.3.5:

The same code generated with uncompyle6 version 3.6.2:

Based on our analysis and the behaviour of the executed malware, the correct interpretation is
the ﬁrst one based on the oldest version of uncompyle6.
For this speciﬁc condition, it is important because it's ﬁltering on the keyboard layout to identify
the targets.

This campaign shows a threat actor interested in speciﬁc Middle Eastern and Arabic-speaking
countries. It also shows us an actor that puts effort in opsec by only using cloud providers. The
malicious documents, the droppers and the RAT itself are developed around cloud providers.
Additionally the attackers implemented anti-VM (and sandbox) and anti-analysis tricks to hide the
malicious activities to the analyst. For example, the VM or the sandbox must have the keyboard
layout of the targeted countries and a disk serial number. This campaign started in November
2019 and it is still ongoing. At this time, the API key is revoked and the Twitter account is
suspended. However, the attacker can easily create new accounts and update the malicious ﬁles
in order to still work. This campaign shows us that network-based detection is important but must
be completed by system behaviour analysis.
