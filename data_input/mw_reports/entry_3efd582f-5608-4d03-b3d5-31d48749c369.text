Caught in the middle are the users. But now, it appears
they not only are the targets, but also the complicit
enablers of attacks.
The Cisco 2015 Annual Security Report, which presents
the research, insights, and perspectives provided by
Cisco® Security Research and other security experts
within Cisco, explores the ongoing race between
attackers and defenders, and how users are becoming
ever-weaker links in the security chain.
Cybersecurity is a broad and complex topic that has a
far-reaching impact on users, companies, governments,
and other entities around the world. The Cisco 2015
Annual Security Report is divided into four areas of
discussion. These sections, and the issues explored
within them, may at first glance seem disparate, but
closer examination reveals their interconnectedness:

1. Threat Intelligence
This section provides an overview of the latest threat research
from Cisco, including updates on exploit kits, spam, threats
and vulnerabilities, and malvertising (malicious advertising)
trends. Online criminals’ growing reliance on users to help
launch their attacks is also examined. To produce their
analysis of observed trends in 2014, Cisco Security Research
utilized a global set of telemetry data. The threat intelligence
provided in the report represents work conducted by top
security experts across Cisco.
2. Security Capabilities Benchmark Study
To gauge perceptions of security professionals on the state of
security in their organizations, Cisco asked chief information
security officers (CISOs) and security operations (SecOps)
managers in nine countries and at organizations of different
sizes about their security resources and procedures. The
study’s findings are exclusive to the Cisco 2015 Annual
Security Report.
3. Geopolitical and Industry Trends
In this section, Cisco security, geopolitical, and policy
experts identify current and emerging geopolitical trends that
organizations—particularly, multinational companies—should
monitor. In focus: how cybercrime is flourishing in areas of
weak governance. Also covered are recent developments
around the world related to the issues of data sovereignty,
data localization, encryption, and data compatibility.

4. Changing the View Toward Cybersecurity—From Users
to the Corporate Boardroom
Cisco security experts suggest that it is time for organizations
to start viewing their approach to cybersecurity differently if
they want to achieve real-world security. Strategies include
adopting more sophisticated security controls to help
defend against threats before, during, and after an attack;
making security a topic at the corporate boardroom level;
and implementing the Cisco Security Manifesto, a set of
security principles that can help organizations become more
dynamic in their approach to security—and more adaptive and
innovative than adversaries.
The interconnectedness of the security topics covered
in the Cisco 2015 Annual Security Report comes down
to this: Attackers have become more proficient at taking
advantage of gaps in security to hide and conceal their
malicious activity. Users—and security teams—are both part
of the security problem. While many defenders believe their
security processes are optimized—and their security tools
are effective—in truth, their security readiness likely needs
improvement. What happens in the geopolitical landscape,
from legislation to security threats, can have a direct impact
on business operations and how an organization addresses
security. And taking into consideration all these factors, it
has never been more critical for organizations of all sizes
to understand that security is a people problem, that
compromise is inevitable, and that the time to take a new
approach to security is now.

Key Discoveries

Following are key discoveries presented in the
Cisco 2015 Annual Security Report.
Attackers have become more proficient at taking
advantage of gaps in security to hide and conceal
malicious activity.
► In 2014, 1 percent of high-urgency common vulnerabilities
and exposure (CVE) alerts were actively exploited.
This means organizations must prioritize and patch that
1 percent of all vulnerabilities quickly. But even with leading
security technology, excellence in process is required to
address vulnerabilities.
► Since the Blackhole exploit kit was sidelined in 2013, no
other exploit kit has been able to achieve similar heights of
success. However, the top spot may not be as coveted by
exploit kit authors as it once was.
► Java exploits have decreased by 34 percent, as Java
security improves and adversaries move to embrace new
attack vectors.
► Flash malware can now interact with JavaScript to help
conceal malicious activity, making it much harder to detect
and analyze.
► Spam volume increased 250 percent from January 2014
to November 2014.
► Snowshoe spam, which involves sending low volumes of
spam from a large set of IP addresses to avoid detection,
is an emerging threat.
Users and IT teams have become unwitting parts of the
security problem.
► Online criminals rely on users to install malware or help
exploit security gaps.

► Users’ careless behavior when using the Internet, combined
with targeted campaigns by adversaries, places many
industry verticals at higher risk of web malware exposure. In
2014, the pharmaceutical and chemical industry emerged
as the number-one highest-risk vertical for web malware
exposure, according to Cisco Security Research.
► Malware creators are using web browser add-ons as a
medium for distributing malware and unwanted applications.
This approach to malware distribution is proving successful
for malicious actors because many users inherently trust
add-ons or simply view them as benign.
The Cisco Security Capabilities Benchmark Study reveals
disconnects in perceptions of security readiness.
► Fifty-nine percent of chief information security officers
(CISOs) view their security processes as optimized, compared
to 46 percent of security operations (SecOps) managers.
► About 75 percent of CISOs see their security tools as very
or extremely effective, with about one-quarter perceiving
security tools as only somewhat effective.
► Ninety-one percent of respondents from companies
with sophisticated security strongly agree that company
executives consider security a high priority.
► Less than 50 percent of respondents use standard
tools such as patching and configuration to help prevent
security breaches.
► Larger, midsize organizations are more likely to have highly
sophisticated security postures, compared to organizations
of other sizes included in the study.

► Heartbleed, the dangerous security flaw, critically exposes
OpenSSL. Yet 56 percent of all OpenSSL versions are older
than 50 months and are therefore still vulnerable.

Attackers vs. Defenders:
An Ongoing Race

VS.

Security professionals and online criminals are in an ongoing
race to see which side can outwit the other.
On the security side, organizations appear to have upped their
game by adopting more sophisticated tools for preventing
attacks and reducing their impact. They’ve recognized the
business necessity of a strong security posture—and express
confidence that their security processes are optimized.
Technology vendors are also more attentive toward finding
and fixing vulnerabilities in their products, giving criminals
fewer opportunities to launch exploits.
But at the same time, adversaries are becoming more
sophisticated not only in their approaches to launching
attacks, but also in evading detection:
► They change their tactics and tools from moment to moment,
disappearing from a network before they can be stopped, or
quickly choosing a different method to gain entry.
► They devise spam campaigns using hundreds of IP
addresses in an attempt to bypass IP-based anti-spam
reputation products.
► They design malware that relies on tools that users trust, or
view as benign, to persistently infect and hide in plain sight
on their machines.
► They find new vulnerabilities to exploit if vendors shut down
weaknesses in other products.
► They work at establishing a hidden presence or blend in
with the targeted organization, sometimes taking weeks or
months to establish multiple footholds in infrastructure and
user databases. Only when they are ready will they execute
their core mission.
According to the new Cisco Security Capabilities Benchmark
Study (see page 24), security professionals say they’re optimistic
that they’re well prepared to hold back online attackers. Yet
adversaries continue to steal information, make money through
scams, or disrupt networks for political goals. In the end, security
is a numbers game: Even if an organization blocks 99.99 percent
of billions of spam messages, some will make it through. There is
no way to ensure 100 percent effectiveness.
When these messages or exploits manage to reach users, it
is the users themselves who become the weak point in the

network. Since enterprises have become more adept at using
solutions that block network breaches, malware, and spam,
malicious actors may instead exploit users through tactics
such as sending them a fake request for a password reset.
With users becoming ever-weaker links in the security
chain, enterprises have choices to make when implementing
security technologies and policies: As developers try to make
applications and software more intuitive and easy to use, do
organizations open new loopholes for cybercriminals to exploit?
Do enterprises bypass users, assuming they cannot be trusted
or taught, and install stricter security controls that impede
how users do their jobs? Do they take the time to educate
users on why security controls are in place, and clearly explain
how users play a vital role in helping the organization achieve
dynamic security that supports the business?
As the principles outlined in the Cisco Security Manifesto
on page 45 suggest, it is the latter. Technology solutions
rarely empower users to take charge of security as active
participants. Instead, they force them to work around security
tools that get in the way of their workday—thus leaving the
business less secure. Security is no longer a question of if
a network will be compromised. Every network will, at some
point, be compromised. What will an organization do then?
And if security staff knew the network was going to be
compromised, would it approach security differently?
The Cisco 2015 Annual Security Report presents the latest
research from its Cisco Security Research group. The team
examines security industry advances designed to help
organizations and users defend against attacks, and the
techniques and strategies employed by adversaries hoping
to break through those defenses. The report also highlights
key findings from the Cisco Security Capabilities Benchmark
Study, which examines the security posture of enterprises
and their perceptions of their preparedness to defend against
attacks. Geopolitical trends, global developments around data
localization, the value of more sophisticated secure access
controls, segmentation based on role-based access, and the
importance of making cybersecurity a boardroom topic are
also discussed.

1. Threat Intelligence

Cisco Security Research has assembled and analyzed security insights in this report based
on a global set of telemetry data. Cisco security experts perform ongoing research and
analysis of discovered threats, such as malware traffic, which can provide insights on
possible future criminal behavior and aid in the detection of threats.

Web Exploits: For Exploit Kit Authors, Holding
the Top Spot May Not Mean You’re the Best
In the business world, companies strive to be known as
industry leaders. But for exploit kit authors operating in the
so-called “shadow economy,” maintaining fourth or fifth
position among leading exploit kits may be an even more
telling sign of success, according to Cisco Security Research.
As reported in the Cisco 2014 Midyear Security Report,
there has been no clear leader among exploit kits since late
2013.1 That’s when authorities sidelined the widely used,
well-maintained, and highly effective Blackhole exploit kit
after arresting its alleged creator and distributor, known as
“Paunch.” Cisco Security Research suggests that a key
reason no dominant exploit kit exists—yet—is simply because
no other kit has emerged as a true technological leader
among contenders. Another trend observed: Since takedown
of Paunch and Blackhole, more exploit kit users appear
to be taking care to invest in kits known to be technically
sophisticated in terms of their ability to evade detection.
Throughout 2014, Angler, Sweet Orange, and Goon were
the exploit kits observed most often “in the wild,” according
to Cisco security experts. Among all exploit kits, Angler was
detected in the field most frequently during 2014, and for
reasons that are unclear, was especially prevalent in late
August. Cisco Security Research attributes Angler’s popularity
to the decision by its author(s) to eliminate the requirement of
downloading a Windows executable to deliver malware.
Angler’s use of Flash, Java, Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE),
and even Silverlight vulnerabilities makes this exploit kit the
“one to watch,” say Cisco researchers. Once the exploit is
triggered, the malware payload is written directly into memory
in a process such as iexplore.exe, instead of being written to
a disk. The payload delivered by Angler looks like a blob of
encrypted data, which makes it harder to identify and block.

Cisco 2015 Annual Security Report | 1. Threat Intelligence

To learn more about Angler, and how malvertising
(malicious advertising) is used as a primary avenue
for delivering the exploit kit to users, see the Cisco
Security blog post, “Angling for Silverlight Exploits.”

The Sweet Orange exploit kit is also very dynamic; its
components, ports, and payload URLs change constantly so
that Sweet Orange can remain effective and avoid detection.
This positions Sweet Orange as the “most likely to succeed”
among exploit kits, according to Cisco Security Research.
Sweet Orange distributes a range of malware to unpatched
end-user systems, and includes exploits for vulnerabilities
in Adobe Flash Player, IE, and Java. Adversaries who use
Sweet Orange often rely on malvertising to redirect users to
websites—including legitimate sites—that host the exploit kit.
Users are usually redirected at least twice in the process.
Compromised websites running outdated versions of content
management systems (CMS) such as WordPress and Joomla
are other locations known to be ripe for hosting the Sweet
Orange exploit kit.2
As for the Goon exploit kit, Cisco Security Research points to
its reputation for reliability as the likely reason for its modest
but consistent popularity in 2014; it also has earned the
distinction of being “the most organized” compared to other
exploit kits. Originally discovered by security researchers in
2013, Goon—known also as the “Goon/Infinity exploit kit”—is
a malware distribution framework that generates exploits for
browser vulnerabilities pertaining to Flash, Java, or Silverlight
components on Windows and Mac platforms.3

Read the Cisco Security blog post, “Fiesta Exploit
Pack Is No Party for Drive-By Victims,” to find out
how companies can defend against the Fiesta
exploit kit. This kit delivers malware through attack
vectors such as Silverlight and uses dynamic DNS
domains (DDNS) as exploit landing pages.

While the overall number of exploit kits detected in the
field had dropped by 87 percent in the months following
the demise of the Blackhole exploit kit, the number of kits
detected by Cisco Security Research increased over the
summer of 2014 (see Figure 1). In the last two weeks of
August, they observed a significant spike in the number of
detections in the field of the Angler exploit kit. However, by
November, the overall number of detections of known exploit
kits had once again declined, with Angler and Goon/Infinity
still showing up most frequently. The overall average decline
in the number of exploit kits detected between May and
November 2014 is 88 percent.

Threats and Vulnerabilities:
Java Declines as an Attack Vector
In recent years, Java has played an unwanted starring role
in lists of the most prevalent and severe vulnerabilities to
exploit. However, Java appears to be falling out of favor
among adversaries searching for the fastest, easiest, and

least detectable ways to launch exploits using software
vulnerabilities, according to Cisco Security Research.
Of the top 25 vendor- and product-related vulnerability alerts
from January 1, 2014, to November 30, 2014, only one was
Java-related (see Table 1’s Common Vulnerability Scoring
System [CVSS] chart on page 10). In 2013, Cisco Security
Research tracked 54 urgent new Java vulnerabilities; in 2014,
the number of tracked Java vulnerabilities fell to just 19. This
should not detract online criminals from the popularity and
effectiveness of attacking these older vulnerabilities that
persist today.
Data from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) shows a
similar decline: NVD reported 309 Java vulnerabilities in 2013
and 253 new Java vulnerabilities in 2014. (Cisco Security
Research tracks significant vulnerabilities that score high on
the CVSS scale, hence the lower number, while the NVD
includes all reported vulnerabilities.) Figure 2 outlines top
vulnerability exploits by vendor and product in 2014.

Exploits involving client-side vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash
Player and Microsoft IE have taken the lead away from
Java, along with exploits that target servers (for example,
exploits involving vulnerabilities in Apache Struts Framework,
the open-source web framework). The growing number of
Apache Struts Framework exploits is an example of the trend
toward criminals compromising online infrastructure as a way
to expand their reach and ability during their attacks.

Annual alert totals, the cumulative new and updated product
vulnerabilities reported in 2014 and compiled by Cisco
Security Research, appear to be on the decline (Figure 4). As
of November 2014, total alerts fell below 2013 totals by 1.8
percent. The percentage may be small, but it is the first time
in recent years that alerts have fallen in number compared to
the previous year.
The most likely reason for the decline is the growing attention
to software testing and development on the part of vendors.
Improved development lifecycles appear to reduce the
number of vulnerabilities that criminals can easily exploit.

New Alerts vs. Updated Alerts
The number of new alerts for 2013 and 2014 indicates
that more new vulnerabilities continue to be reported than
in previous years, meaning that vendors, developers, and
security researchers are finding, fixing, and reporting more
new vulnerabilities in their products. As shown in Figure 5, the
total number of new alerts and the annual total are even or
slightly declining in 2014 compared to 2013.
Table 1 illustrates some of the most commonly exploited
vulnerabilities, according to the Common Vulnerability Scoring
System (CVSS). The U.S. National Institute of Standards and
Technology’s (NIST) National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
provides a framework for communicating the characteristics
and impacts of IT vulnerabilities and supports the CVSS.
The “Urgency” score in the CVSS table indicates that these
vulnerabilities are being actively exploited, which corresponds
to the “Temporal” scores indicating active exploits. By
scanning the list of products being exploited, enterprises
can also determine which of these products are in use and
therefore need to be monitored and patched.
Figure 6 depicts the vendors and products with the highest
CVSS scores. Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that a
proof-of-concept exploit code exists; however, the code is
not known to be publicly available.
Note: The vulnerabilities in Table 1 were those showing initial signs
of exploit activity during the period observed. The majority of these
vulnerabilities had not yet gone mainstream, meaning they had not
made their way into exploit kits for sale.

Analysis: Likely Factors for Adversaries
Abandoning Java Exploits
Cisco Security Research suggests that the decline in Java
exploits can be tied partly to the fact that there were no new
zero-day Java exploits disclosed and available for adversaries
to take advantage of in 2014. Modern versions of Java
automatically patch, and older, more vulnerable versions of
the Java Runtime Environment are being blocked by default
by browser vendors. Apple is even taking the extra step of
disabling old and vulnerable versions of Java and patching
them through automatic updates. In addition, the U.S.
Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) has been
recommending since January 2013 that computer users
secure, disable, or remove Java.
The latest version of Java, Java 8, has stronger controls
than previous releases. It is also harder to exploit because it
now requires human interaction, like code signing and a user
dialogue that asks the user to enable Java. Online criminals
have discovered easier targets and have turned their attention

to non-Java vectors that deliver higher return on investment.
For example, many users fail to update Adobe Flash and PDF
readers or browsers regularly, providing criminals with a wider
range of both old and new vulnerabilities to exploit. And as
reported in the Cisco 2014 Midyear Security Report, the
number of exploit kits that include Microsoft Silverlight exploits
is growing.4
Figure 7 shows that Java’s reign as the top attack vector
has been on a steady downward trend for more than a year.
The use of Flash to launch exploits has been somewhat
erratic, with the biggest spike occurring in January 2014. PDF
use has been constant, as many malicious actors appear
to remain focused on launching highly targeted campaigns
through email using PDF attachments. Silverlight attacks,
while still very low in number compared to more established
vectors, are on the rise—especially since August.

Flash and JavaScript: Better Together?
In 2014, Cisco Security Research observed growth in the use of Flash malware that interacts with JavaScript.
The exploit is shared between two different files—one Flash, one JavaScript. Sharing exploits over two different
files and formats makes it more difficult for security devices to identify and block the exploit, and to analyze it
with reverse engineering tools. This approach also helps adversaries to be more efficient and effective in their
attacks. For example, if the first stage of an attack is entirely in JavaScript, then the second stage, the payload
transmission, would not occur until after the JavaScript executes successfully. This way, only users who can run
the malicious file receive the payload.

Uncovering the Archaeology of Vulnerabilities:
The Dangers of Outdated Software—and Why
Patching Isn’t the Only Solution
As explained in the discussion about vulnerabilities (see
page 8), adversaries take the easiest path available when
determining how and where their exploits will succeed.
They choose products that present more attack surface
opportunities; those opportunities are generally created by
the use of unpatched or outdated software. For example,
appliance patching remains a challenge since there are many
systems still vulnerable to the SSL Poodle attack.5 Based on
observed trends, Cisco Security Research suggests that the
proliferation of outdated versions of exploitable software will
continue to lead to security issues of great magnitude.

Cisco Security Research used scanning engines to examine
devices connected to the Internet and using OpenSSL. The
team determined that 56 percent of devices surveyed used
versions of OpenSSL that were more than 50 months old.
This means that despite the publicity given to Heartbleed,6
the security flaw in the handling of Transport Layer Security
(TLS) discovered in 2014, and the urgent need to upgrade
to the latest version of OpenSSL software to avoid such
vulnerabilities, organizations are failing to ensure that they
are running the latest versions. Figure 8 shows the age of
OpenSSL versions.

Possible Solutions: Automatic Updates and Patching
Greater use of automatic updating may be one solution to
the outdated software problem. Cisco Security Research
examined data from devices that were connected online and
using either the Chrome or IE browser. The data showed
that 64 percent of Chrome requests originate from the latest
version of that browser. As for IE users, just 10 percent of
requests originated from the latest version.
Cisco Security Research suggests that the Chrome
automated update system may be more successful in
ensuring that as many users as possible have the most recent
software version. (Also, it’s possible that Chrome users are
more technically proficient than IE users and thus, are more
likely to update their browsers and install updates.)
When combined with the downturn in Java vulnerabilities
and exploitation, the research clearly indicates that software
that automatically installs its own updates seems to have
an advantage in creating a safer security framework. To
overcome the guaranteed eventual compromise that
results from manual update processes, it may be time
for organizations to accept the occasional failure and
incompatibility that automatic updates represent.

Industry Vertical Risk Report: Targeting by
Adversaries and Users’ Careless Practices
Are a Potent Combination for Companies
in High-Risk Verticals

While the retail vertical might be expected to have a higher
ranking on this list given recent high-profile attacks that have
plagued the industry, it is malicious encounters, and not actual
breaches, that are used to create the rankings.
To determine sector-specific malware encounter rates, Cisco
Security Research compares the median encounter rate for all
organizations that use Cisco Cloud Web Security to the median
encounter rate for all companies in a specific sector that are
using the service (Figure 9). An industry encounter magnitude
above 1 reflects a higher than normal risk of web malware
encounters, whereas a magnitude below 1 reflects a lower risk.
For example, a company with a 1.7 encounter magnitude is
at a 70 percent increased risk than the median. Conversely, a
company with a 0.7 encounter magnitude is 30 percent below
the median risk of encounter.

Encounter vs. Compromise
An “encounter” is an instance when malware is
blocked. Unlike a “compromise,” a user is not
infected during an encounter because a binary is
not downloaded.

The pharmaceutical and chemical industry has emerged
as the number-one high-risk vertical for web malware
encounters in 2014. For the first half of the year, media
and publishing held the top spot, but had edged down to
second place by November. Rounding out the top five are
manufacturing, transportation and shipping, and aviation,
respectively. All of these verticals placed in the top five for
the first half of 2014.

Cisco Security Research examined eight types of attack
methods (Figure 10) to determine whether targeting by
adversaries or how people use the web was the key factor for
increasing an industry vertical’s risk for malware encounters.
They found a perfect storm, with the combination of targeted
attack methods and careless user behavior online both having
an impact on the level of risk.

To determine whether there was in fact a difference between
high- and low-risk vertical user behavior, Cisco Security
Research looked at four types of non-targeted attack
methods users often encounter when browsing the Internet:
adware, clickfraud, scam, and iframe injections. The team
also looked at four types of more advanced attack methods
that adversaries often employ in targeted campaigns: exploit,
Trojan, OI (detection malware), and downloader.
Note: The eight attack methods have been categorized by Cisco
Security Research into heuristic buckets.

Using the top and bottom four most malware-exposed
verticals, according to Cisco Cloud Web Security data, Cisco
Security Research then took the percentage of incidents for
each type of attack method and created average rates for
the top and bottom four verticals. The comparison shown
in Figure 10 was derived by dividing the top average by
the bottom average. A ratio of one indicates that the same
patterns of activity are observed between the most- and
least-targeted groups.
The data shows that the most high-risk industry verticals
encounter sophisticated downloader attack methods at a
frequency seven times higher than that of the bottom four
high-risk industry verticals. This is consistent with what one
would expect if targeted attack methods against the highestrisk verticals were taking place.
The rate of encounters with clickfraud and adware is also
higher in the most-targeted and high-risk industry verticals
compared to the less-targeted and lower-risk verticals. This
suggests that the difference may be more complex than just
targeting by malicious actors. User behavior may also be

implicated in the increased exposure to malware, possibly
through differences in how users engage with the Internet and
their browsing habits, and are therefore contributing to the
higher frequency of web malware attack method encounters
in high-risk industry verticals. Also, users in industries where
the quick embrace of new media is encouraged and necessary
for competition and innovation are likely encountering web
malware attack methods at higher rates than users in other
industries, such as government, where Internet use may be
more limited and/or strictly controlled.
For example, Cisco Security Research suggests that because
users in the media and publishing industry are typically heavy
users of the Internet, they are at risk of encountering web
exploits more often than users in other industry verticals.
Note: In 2014, the media and publishing industry experienced
significantly higher than normal rates of web malware encounters
than previously observed by Cisco Security Research, which
has been compiling this data since 2008. Users’ exposure to
more widespread malvertising on legitimate websites could be a
contributing factor to this increase.

Malware Encounters by Region
Following is web malware encounter risk data for high-risk
industry verticals according to region. The three regions are
defined as follows:

► Users in the real estate and land management industry in
APJC, and users in the automotive industry in that region,
are both 3.5 times more likely to be exposed to malware.

► North America, Central America, and Latin America (AMER)

► Users in the transportation and shipping industry in APJC
are 3.25 times more likely to be exposed to malware.

► Asia-Pacific, China, Japan, and India (APJC)
► Africa, Europe, and the Middle East (EMEA)
Cisco Security Research identified the highest-risk localized
industry verticals (see industries listed in Figure 11) across
the world and determined that:
► Users in the insurance industry in APJC are six times more
likely to be exposed to malware compared to the 12 verticals
examined in all three regions. (Baseline average: 1.5.)
► Users in the aviation industry in AMER are five times more
likely to be exposed to malware.

Cisco Security Research cites skyrocketing land and housing
prices, recent natural disasters, and heavy export and
manufacturing activity in APJC as factors for adversaries
targeting users in that region who work in or do business with
the automotive, insurance, real estate and land management,
and transportation and shipping industries. Theft of customer
data, intellectual property (including targeting by nation
states), and air freight data are likely top motivations for
targeting users in the aviation industry in AMER.

Attack Methods for Distributing Malware, by Region
Figures 12a through 12c reveal, by region, the techniques
adversaries are using most often to distribute malware. The
findings in these charts are based primarily on where blocks
of web malware occurred (that is, encounters), according to
Cisco Cloud Web Security data, versus types of threats on
the web.
During the year 2014, users in AMER were targeted primarily
by malicious scripts; iframe injections were a distant second.
In APJC, adversaries have been relying heavily on scams,
malicious scripts, and web-based exploits over the past year
to compromise users in all verticals. And in EMEA, web-based
exploits are especially prevalent.

Spam Update: Spammers Adopt the
“Snowshoe” Strategy
Phishing continues to prove its value to criminals as a tool for
malware delivery and credential theft because users still fall
prey to familiar spam tactics. Attackers have become aware
that it is often easier to exploit users at the browser and
email level, rather than compromising servers—which means
spammers continue to innovate.

The snowshoe messages examined by Cisco researchers
show some standard hallmarks of spam. For example, they
have misspelled subject lines such as “inovice 2921411.pdf,”
and include a randomly generated number. Attachments were
typically PDF files containing a Trojan exploiting a vulnerability
in Adobe Reader.

It is not uncommon to see an anti-spam system catch more
than 99 percent of the spam passing through it. Most of the
best anti-spam systems catch more than 99.9 percent of
spam. In this environment, spammers try just about anything to
evade spam filters. To ensure that spam reaches its intended
audience, spammers are increasingly using these tactics to
avoid detection by IP-based anti-spam reputation technologies.

Figure 14. Snowshoe Spam Campaign Incident

Enter snowshoe spam: The comparison is apt because
snowshoes allow a person to walk over deep snow by distributing their weight over a larger surface area, thus preventing
the wearer’s foot from sinking. Snowshoe spam is unsolicited
bulk email that is sent using a large number of IP addresses,
and at a low message volume per IP address, thus preventing
some spam systems from sinking the spam. Figure 13
highlights the rise in snowshoe spam from 2013 to 2014.
In a recent snowshoe spam campaign observed by Cisco
Security Research, a blitz approach was used. This means
the total spam campaign took place over just three hours, but
at one point accounted for 10 percent of global spam traffic
(Figure 14).

To learn more about snowshoe spam, see the
Cisco Security blog post, “Snowshoe Spam
Attack Comes and Goes in a Flurry.”

To mitigate snowshoe spam, security professionals cannot
simply rely on solutions that are based on reputation, since the
same messages in a campaign can originate from hundreds
or even thousands of places in the case of botnet-derived
campaigns. Examining other hallmarks of spam, such as email
server hygiene, can provide more precise detection. In the
campaigns observed by Cisco Security Research, for instance,
many of the IP addresses lacked matching forward and reverse
domain name systems (DNS), which is generally considered an
obvious indicator that a mail server is not legitimate.
Many of these IP addresses also lacked records of sending
emails prior to the start of the snowshoe campaign, further
indicating that online criminals are using compromised
machines to create an infrastructure for snowshoe spam.

Spammers Expand Tactics to Outwit Consumers
Worldwide spam volumes are on the rise, indicating that
spam is still a lucrative vector for online criminals (Figure 16).
Adversaries continue to refine messages so that spam is
more likely to fool recipients into clicking on dangerous links,
often using social engineering tactics.
While spam volume has generally been on the decline in the
United States in 2014, levels rose in other countries during
the same time period (Figure 15). Cisco Security Research
suggests that this indicates some malicious actors may be
shifting their base of operations. The rise in spam volume
in some countries may also be a sign that other regions are

catching up to the United States in terms of spam production,
as the country has long been a leading source of worldwide
spam. Ultimately, the United States ended the year higher.
Spear-phishing messages, a staple of online criminals for
years, have evolved to the point where even experienced
end users have a hard time spotting faked messages among
their authentic emails. These messages, which target specific
individuals with a well-crafted message, appear to come from
well-known vendors or service providers from whom users
commonly receive messages—for example, delivery services,
online shopping sites, and music and entertainment providers.
Emails with a trusted name and a logo, even if spoofed, carry
more weight than the old-school spam messages touting
pharmaceuticals or watches. And if the messages have a call
to action that is familiar to recipients, such as a notice about
a recent order, or a delivery tracking number, users will be
further enticed to click on links contained in the email.
Cisco Security Research recently observed a small number of
spear-phishing messages purporting to originate from Apple
Inc., claiming that the recipients had downloaded a popular
game for mobile iOS devices. The email subject line included
a randomly generated receipt number, another seemingly
authentic touch, since legitimate emails would usually
contain such a number. A link in the message suggested that
recipients log in and change their passwords if they had not
initiated the game download, and the link redirected the user
to a known phishing website.

Spammers Morph Messages to Evade Detection
When spammers find a formula that succeeds—meaning they
are able to convince users to click on links within spam, or
purchase fake products—they will tweak messages so that
their basic structure remains the same. But the messages are
different enough that they can evade spam filters, at least for

a short time. In Table 2, Cisco researchers tallied the number
of times during a sample period that the spammers attempted
to change message content in order to evade ongoing
mitigations. The table lists those threats that required Cisco
Email Security Appliance (ESA) rule changes.

Malvertising from Browser Add-Ons:
Inflicting Slight Damage Per User to
Collect Big Rewards
Cisco Security Research recently conducted in-depth analysis
of a web-based threat that uses malvertising (malicious
advertising) from web browser add-ons as a medium for
distributing malware and unwanted applications. The group
discovered that the threat has strong characteristics that
resemble the behavior of a botnet. Through the team’s
research, which included the examination of the activity of
more than 800,000 users at 70 companies from January
1 through November 30, 2014, Cisco Security Research
measured the overall size of the threat and corroborated the
intention and structure.
The analysis revealed that this family of browser add-ons
is far more extensive than expected and that the malware
creators are using a combination of highly sophisticated,
professionally written code and a refined business model
to keep their malware in profitable operation for the long
term. In other words, full control over the targeted host is
not necessary for successful monetization. This leads to
increased prevalence of malware deliberately engineered for
lower impact on the affected host, and optimized for longterm monetization over a large affected population.
Compromised users are infected with these malicious browser
add-ons through the installation of bundled software (software
distributed with another software package or product) and
usually without clear user consent. Applications such as PDF
tools or video players downloaded from untrusted sources
are installed knowingly by users believing they are legitimate.

The applications can be “bundled” with unwanted and malicious
software. This approach of distributing malware follows a payper-install (PPI) monetization scheme, in which the publisher
gets paid for every installation of software bundled in the
original application.
Many users inherently trust add-ons or simply view them as
benign, which is why this approach to malware distribution
is proving successful for malicious actors. This method of
distributing malware allows adversaries to decrease their reliance
on other techniques, such as exploit kits, that may be more
detectable. (See “Web Exploits: For Exploit Kit Authors, Holding
the Top Spot May Not Mean You’re the Best,” page 7.)
Cisco Security Research observed that the web traffic
generated by this browser add-on family has specific
characteristics, and can be identified by two well-defined
patterns. The query string usually contains encoded data, in
which information such as the add-on name and the URL the
user previously visited (including intranet links), is exfiltrated.
During its analysis, Cisco Security Research found
more than 4000 different add-on names, including
PassShow, Bettersurf, Bettermarkit, and associated SHAs
(bee4b83970ffa8346f0e791be92555702154348c14bd8
a1048abaf5b3ca049e35167317272539fa0dece3ac1a60
10c7a936be8cbf70c09e547e0973ef21718e5). Because
more than one add-on name may be used per installation,
the malware is very difficult to track (Figure 17).

Malware Detects OS Types, Serves Up Appropriate Exploits
Cisco security researchers observed that the malicious add-ons they analyzed will display a certain type of
advertising depending on the browser “fingerprint” of a user. Injected ads for Linux users were usually about
online gaming sites. Users who had Microsoft IE installed were redirected to ads that lead to the download of
seemingly legitimate software, which actually turns out to be malicious.

Based on analysis of 11 months of user activity at 70
companies, the number of users affected by this threat has
been rising. In January, 711 users were affected, but in the
second half of the year the number of affected users went
above 1000, with a peak in September, of 1751 (Figure 18).
One of the reasons for the significant spike in September and
October could be the increase in online activity, with people
back to work after summer vacations.

Through research, Cisco security experts learned that
adversaries are employing several different servers to support
their malware campaigns. This likely means that either one
cybercriminal organization skilled at keeping its activities
segmented is responsible for the threat, or one “technology
provider” is selling its product to several groups. Regardless,
whoever is responsible for distributing the malware appears to
be attempting to create a botnet of substantial size.

Tips for Prevention and Remediation

Cisco Security Research also found more than 500 unique
domains associated with this threat; 24 of them are ranked
on Alexa below the top 1 million domains. Many are also
relatively highly ranked domains (Figure 19). This means they
are popular domains, yet very dangerous for users to visit due
to the risk of compromise.

To avoid being compromised by the browser ad-don
scheme, or to address an existing infection, users
should apply the following tips:
► Download applications from trusted sources
► Unselect unwanted software in bundle installs
► Use threat analytics, sandboxing technologies,
and web security technologies to help prevent and
detect this type of threat
► Manually remove add-ons if possible; also, use
antispyware tools to clean up unwanted programs

Some of the domains have been active for more than a year,
but most have a much shorter lifecycle—only a few weeks,
in many cases (Figure 19). All of the domains share one
characteristic: They become popular very quickly.

2. Cisco Security Capabilities
Benchmark Study

To gauge perceptions of security professionals on the state of security in their organizations,
Cisco asked chief information security officers (CISOs) and security operations (SecOps)
managers in several countries and at organizations of different sizes about their security
resources and procedures. The Cisco Security Capabilities and Benchmark Study, completed
in October 2014, offers insights on the sophistication level of security operations, and
security practices currently in use.
Cisco Security Capabilities: How Well Do
Organizations Measure Up?
How do enterprise security professionals view their organizations’ readiness to handle security breaches? The answer
may depend on the role they play within an organization, and
which industry they work in, according to the new Cisco

Another gap in confidence appeared when respondents
were asked about their confidence in their organizational
security policies. Both CISOs and SecOps managers show
high levels of confidence in policies (see Figure 21); yet they
have less confidence in their abilities to scope and contain
compromises (see Figure 28).

The study surveyed CISOs and SecOps managers to
learn about the resources their companies are devoting
to cybersecurity; their security operations, policies, and
procedures; and the sophistication level of their cybersecurity
operations. The good news from the survey is that a majority
of security professionals believe they have the tools and
processes in place to maintain security effectively. However,
CISOs are notably more optimistic than their SecOps
colleagues about the state of their security. For example,
62 percent of CISOs said they strongly agree that security
processes in their organization are clear and well understood,
compared to only 48 percent of SecOps managers. CISOs
also view their security processes in a more favorable light.
Fifty-nine percent of those surveyed strongly agree that these
processes are optimized, and that they now focus on process
improvement, compared to 46 percent of SecOps managers.

A similar gap appeared when respondents were asked about
their security controls: Nearly all respondents said they had
good security controls, but about one-quarter perceive their
security tools to be only “somewhat” rather than “very” or
“extremely” effective (see Figure 29).
Confidence in security processes and practices also seems
to vary by industry. CISOs and SecOps managers for utility/
energy companies and telecommunications businesses
seem to be the most confident, while government, financial
services, pharmaceuticals, and healthcare organizations
seem less confident. For instance, 62 percent of
telecommunications and utility/energy security executives
strongly agree that their security processes are optimized,
compared to 50 percent of those working in financial services
and 52 percent in government.

Why the gap in confidence levels? It’s likely due to the fact that
CISOs are more removed from day-to-day security activities,
whereas SecOps staff are working closely to resolve both major
and minor security incidents. A CISO of a very large organization
might not realize that a thousand machines are infected by
malware in a typical day, whereas the SecOps manager would
have devoted much more time to mitigating the infection, hence
his or her less optimistic outlook on organizational security.

Utilities/energy and telecommunications security professionals
seem to be the most sophisticated in their security practices,

Signs of Security Sophistication
The Cisco Security Capabilities Benchmark Study also
highlighted the hallmarks of organizations that are more
sophisticated in their security posture than others. These
hallmarks include:
► Executive leadership that prioritizes security
► Clear, well-documented policies and procedures
► Integrated tools that work together

Ninety-one percent of respondents from sophisticated
companies strongly agree that company executives
consider security a high priority, while only 22 percent of
respondents from the least-sophisticated companies agree
with this statement. In addition, 88 percent of respondents
from sophisticated companies strongly agree that security
processes are clear and understood, compared to 0 percent
of respondents from the least-sophisticated companies.

The high level of organizations with a security point person is encouraging: Without security leadership, process are less defined,
communicated and enforced. It’s likely that recent high-profile security breaches have spurred on organizations to carve out
a place for security management in their executive ranks.

CISOs (and equivalent) are more optimistic than SecOps managers about the state of security in their
companies, perhaps because they’re further from day-to-day realities.

Figure 23 shows that 91 percent of respondents report
having an executive with direct responsibility for security,
most often a CISO or a chief security officer (CSO). The
high level of organizations with a security point person is
encouraging: Without security leadership, processes are less
defined, communicated, and enforced. It is likely that recent
high-profile security breaches have spurred on organizations
to carve out a place for security management in their
executive ranks.
Seventy-eight percent of respondents from more
sophisticated companies strongly agree that security
technologies are well integrated to work effectively together,
compared to 17 percent of respondents from the leastsophisticated companies.

The positive news for organizations hoping to boost the
sophistication of their security processes is that assembling
a large team of hard-to-find security talent isn’t necessarily
a requirement. In the least-sophisticated organizations, the
median number of security professionals is 32; in those with
the highest levels of sophistication, the median number of
security staff is also 32. Therefore, employing more people
does not seem to directly correlate to better management
of security processes. A better approach to staffing security
personnel would be to find an optimal ratio of security staff to
the number of overall employees in the company.

Less-sophisticated security organizations generally do not believe that executives consider security a high priority, nor do they
believe that security processes are clear and well-understood

Figure 24 reveals that less-sophisticated security organizations
generally do not believe that executives consider security a
high priority, nor do they believe that security processes are
clear and well understood.
In comparing the security sophistication level of organizations
by country, there’s more good news: Highly sophisticated
organizations are the majority in every segment. However,
respondents in some countries appear to have a more
positive view of their own security stance than the outside
world does. Overly confident perceptions from respondents
in some countries may be due in part to core social values
of a culture, such as the need to present one’s self—and thus,
one’s organization—in a positive light.

Beware of Overconfidence
While CISOs and SecOps managers are showing
confidence in their security operations, they also
indicate that they do not use standard tools that
can help thwart security breaches. Less than 50
percent of respondents use the following tools:
► Identity administration or user provisioning
► Patching and configuration
► Penetration testing
► Endpoint forensics
► Vulnerability scanning

Midmarket Organizations Appear Well Positioned for
Security Readiness
Very large organizations are expected to successfully manage
security because they have access to the most resources:
budget for buying the latest technology, and skilled staff
to manage it. Larger midsize enterprises (defined for the
purposes of the study as having 500 to 999 employees)
might be assumed to lag behind their larger counterparts
(1000 or more employees) in terms of their readiness to
respond to security incidents. However, according to the Cisco
Security Capabilities Benchmark Study, larger midmarket
enterprises appear to not only mirror enterprises in security
readiness in many areas, but often rate even higher than large
organizations, perhaps due to increased organization flexibility
and greater agility.
In fact, according to the study, larger midsize organizations
are more likely to have highly sophisticated security
postures. As illustrated in Figure 36, significantly more

large midsize organizations rate in the upper midlevel and
high level of sophistication than do smaller midmarket
organizations (250-499 employees) and enterprise
organizations (1000 or more employees).
The mostly level playing field for midmarket enterprises is
promising news, since midmarket companies are the engine
of the recovering economy.
Key findings from the benchmark survey on midmarket
enterprises and their security readiness:
► Ninety-two percent of midsize organizations have internal
incidence response teams, as opposed to 93 percent of
large enterprises.
► Ninety-four percent of midsize organizations have an
executive directly accountable for security, as opposed to
92 percent of larger enterprises.

Large midsize organizations show a high level of sophistication in their security posture.

3. Geopolitical and Industry Trends

Cisco security, geopolitical, and policy experts identify current and emerging geopolitical
trends that organizations, particularly multinational companies, should monitor. These same
experts also examine recent and potential developments around the world related to the
issues of data sovereignty, data localization, encryption, and data compatibility.
Cybercrime Thriving in
Areas of Weak Governance
While CISOs and other security leaders may not always think
to pay close attention to geopolitical dynamics, they should,
especially if they work for a multinational organization. What
happens in the geopolitical landscape can have a direct impact
on global supply chains, and how the business manages
customer and employee data in different countries; it also can
create more legal and regulatory costs, risk of trade secret
theft, and physical and reputational risks.
Cybercrime is flourishing around the world, especially in areas
of weak governance. Eastern Europe, which has long been a
hotbed of organized crime, is one example. In areas of weak
governance, it is not unusual to find evidence of strong ties
between government intelligence services and organized
groups involved in cybercrime.

Transnational Terrorist Groups Leveraging the Internet
The emergence of transnational terrorist groups, such as the
so-called Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL), is another
geopolitical trend to watch. While groups like ISIS do not appear
to be engaged in any significant cybercrime activity, they do
rely heavily on the Internet—namely, social media—to recruit
members. For now, it appears that leading transnational terrorist
groups are making enough money through traditional fundraising
activities such as extortion, human trafficking, and oil. But as
these organizations grow, they could turn to cybercrime as a way
to fund their efforts around the world. There is also the potential
that budding terrorist organizations that do not have access to
the same resources as more established groups may explore
cybercrime as a fast path to growth.

According to U.S. authorities, some recent high-profile attacks
that targeted assets in the United States likely originated from
such areas. Some of the attacks appeared not to be profitoriented, but politically motivated campaigns or attempts to
gather intelligence or infiltrate infrastructure.7 This could be an
indication that the campaigns were state-sponsored and/or
orchestrated by sophisticated cybercrime organizations.

See the Cisco blog post “Cupcakes and
Cyberespionage,” to read about a suggested new
approach for defending against cyberespionage.

More governments are making a concerted effort to implement
increased cyber-governance through legislation and regulation.
China, for example, made “rule of law” the theme for the
fourth plenum of the 18th Communist Party of China (CCP)
Congress.8 Beijing has committed to rooting out corruption and
enforcing laws in business and within government. This effort
may strengthen law enforcement and international efforts to
track down cybercriminals and make it harder for them to hide.

Cisco 2015 Annual Security Report | 3. Geopolitical and Industry Trends

The Conundrum of Data Sovereignty,
Data Localization, and Encryption
Edward Snowden’s allegations about U.S. government
surveillance overreach, data sovereignty (the concept that
data is subject to the jurisdiction of the country where it is
located and not that of foreign governments or courts that
may be seeking unilateral access to it), and data localization
(a government mandate that data be stored in a certain place)
have become hot-button issues.
Some countries are beginning to seek the ability to localize
their data as a way to prevent foreign governments from
gaining access to their citizens’ data. They are drafting
requirements that data remain inside of their country, or be
routed in certain ways, and that companies use domestically
manufactured equipment.
Brazil, as an example, recently implemented a new law that
“contains privacy requirements that broadly restrict [covered]
companies from the sharing of users’ personal information,
their communications, and certain online logging data.”9
Russia, meanwhile, recently amended its data protection and
information legislation to require all data operators processing
personal data of Russian citizens, including Internet data, to
keep copies of such data on servers and databases within
Russia; the law is slated to go into effect in 2015.10
A potential negative consequence of countries mandating
data localization—creating legislation that is not interoperable—
is that multinational companies could be subjected to
conflicting legal requirements. An obligation to comply with
the demands of one nation to produce, retain, or destroy data
could violate the laws of another country.
Figure 37. The Conundrum of Balancing Data Sovereignty,
Localization, and Encryption

Access
Data Sovereignty
Data Localization
Data Encryption

Aside from potentially causing conflicting legal obligations,
data localization requirements also have the potential to
restrict the flow of data across borders. This can create
confusion, as well as significant challenges in administering
networks. There is a supply chain aspect here as well: More
global supply chain operators are adopting cloud-based
technology to connect all of their partners around the world.
Data localization could hinder, or prevent data exchange in
those business networks, and potentially hinder cross-border
activities to police cybercrime activity.
Additionally, as some countries opt to use only homegrown
technologies, or place significant restrictions on who can
handle their citizens’ data, there is the potential that they will cut
themselves off from the global talent pool and possibly risk a loss
of innovation that comes from cross-pollination of new ideas.
Some leading technology companies in the United States are
hoping that use of end-to-end encryption will be a way to
satisfy their customers’ concerns that their data be protected
as it traverses the borderless Internet. The U.S. government
has raised concerns, however, that such encryption will
prevent its ability to protect citizens. The new director of the
GCHQ, Britain’s premier signals intelligence organization,
similar to the U.S. National Security Agency, even suggested
that U.S. social media technology giants are aiding the
efforts of terrorists by enabling them to send encrypted
communications around the world.11
Despite these criticisms, technology companies are likely
to continue to pursue the development and adoption of
technological measures aimed at restoring customer trust
until governments have adopted policies that more effectively
reflect the importance of enabling free speech and secure
commerce while they protect against threats to public safety
and national security.
Trust in technology products, and in the companies that develop
them, will go a long way toward countries and their governments
and citizens having confidence that they, and their data, are
protected. As Mark Chandler, Cisco senior vice president,
general counsel, and secretary, noted in a Cisco blog post
earlier this year, “A serious effort to address these issues can
build confidence, and most importantly, result in the promise of
the next generation of the Internet being met, a world in which
the connection of people and devices drives greater freedom,
prosperity, and opportunity for all the world’s citizens.”12

Data Privacy Compatibility
A person’s or organization’s attitudes about data privacy
can vary greatly depending on where in the world they live
and work. These varied viewpoints affect how governments
regulate data privacy, and how enterprises do business when
these regulations are at odds with each other. The Data
Protection Heat Index Survey Report, sponsored by Cisco
and prepared by the Cloud Security Alliance, details some of
the challenges faced by enterprises working with data outside
of their own countries, or data that belongs to individuals
outside of the country in which the business operates.
The conversation around data privacy compatibility—that is,
creating consistent global approaches to data privacy—has
become more urgent due to the growth of cloud services.
For example, if a company based in the United States
purchases cloud storage from a company in India, and used
that cloud to store data for customers residing in Germany,
which region or country’s privacy laws apply?
Figure 38. Meeting Diverse
Regulatory and Consumer Expectations

Expectations

Cloud Sharing

Consumer
Expectations

Other drivers of data privacy compatibility are the Internet of
Things (IoT) and big data. As enterprises consider new ways
to connect devices to each other, and use massive datasets
to make business decisions, they need structure and rules for
how this data may be handled on a global scale.
Various efforts are under way aimed at harmonizing data
privacy requirements across a region or group of countries.
For example, European Union legislation is currently
being shaped that will update the existing data protection
framework—the General Data Protection Regulation, calling
for a harmonization of data protection regulations. Efforts
to achieve consensus around data privacy and data
sovereignty laws are intensifying. Greater harmonization
would be welcome, but it is also important that the final text
is outcome-oriented, interoperates with other regions, and is
appropriate for the new technology realities. The Asia-Pacific
region has developed the Cross-Border Privacy Enforcement
Arrangement from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC), which facilitates data sharing in local economies.
More work must be done by governments to meet the
larger goal of creating compatible regimes for data privacy
and security anchored in globally recognized standards that
promote an open Internet with free flows of data across both
national and regional borders.
As countries and regions clarify their data privacy approaches,
enterprises will be better able to apply consistent privacy
practices globally, and implement more effective “privacy
by design” frameworks, in which privacy capabilities are
built into products and services right from the start. Clear
and consistent privacy regulatory frameworks would help
companies meet and exceed privacy requirements, no
matter where their offerings are being deployed, thereby
encouraging innovative product development and use of data.

Data Privacy: A Shared Understanding
The data protection survey asked global privacy experts in
North America, the European Union, and the Asia-Pacific
region about regulation of data in their region, governmental
practices, user content, and security standards. Responses
showed a high level of consistency in respondents’
understanding of the meaning of data privacy, and in the
value of global privacy standards.
► Data residency and sovereignty: Respondents identified
personal data and personally identifiable information (PII) as
the data that is required to remain resident in most countries.
► Lawful interception: Respondents showed a universal
interpretation of when and how data may be intercepted—for
example, when it’s needed for a criminal investigation.
► User consent: Seventy-three percent of respondents
agreed that there should be a consumer privacy bill of rights
that is global in nature as opposed to regional. Sixty-five
percent said that the United Nations should play an active
role in the creation of such a bill.

In sum, the data privacy survey seems to show that many
experts agree on basic privacy principles that, if adopted
and standardized globally, can be an enabler of business,
not an obstacle. The results also indicate that data privacy
experts share an interest in “baking in” privacy principles for
new technology solutions, instead of trying to retrofit these
solutions to accommodate privacy requirements. However,
current privacy regulatory frameworks are relatively nascent
and evolving rapidly.
Should a greater level of harmonization advance, companies
and individuals will benefit. But to the extent that industry
continues to see discordant privacy frameworks globally,
companies will need to think through privacy and data
protection issues carefully, and proactively adapt their
offerings and processes to meet diverse customer and
regulatory expectations.

► Privacy principles: Respondents were asked if privacy
principles from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation
and Development would facilitate data harmonization, or
would instead create greater tension. The data privacy
experts surveyed were largely in favor of the adoption of
these principles.

4. Changing the View Toward Cybersecurity—
From Users to the Corporate Boardroom

Cisco security experts suggest that it is time for enterprises to start looking differently at
how they approach cybersecurity so they can truly make their organizations more secure.
Strategies include considering new approaches to help align people, processes, and
technology, making security a topic at the corporate boardroom level, and adopting more
sophisticated security controls that can reduce the endpoint and attack surface—and harden
the network after an attack.
Secure Access: Understanding Who Is on
Your Network, When, and How
CISOs and other security professionals are faced with
complex challenges regarding access to network information
and services. Thanks to the trends toward mobility and
bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policies, they must ensure
that employees can gain access to enterprise resources, no
matter where they happen to be, and no matter how they
join the network.
Security professionals also need to protect the network from
unapproved users or criminal attacks, and they must do so
in a way that doesn’t impede access by legitimate users.
For example, virtual private networks (VPNs) used to be
the standard solution for providing network access control.
However, some VPNs call for complicated login procedures
by users as well as special software, limiting when and how
people join the network. In addition, many VPNs don’t help IT
departments identify who is gaining access and from where,
nor can VPNs identify the devices in use. VPNs are evolving
to provide more visibility, while producing a more transparent
user experience in order to provide better endpoint security.
Network access controls (NACs) are evolving away from basic
security protection to more sophisticated endpoint visibility,
access, and security (EVAS) controls. Unlike older NAC
technologies, EVAS use more granular information to enforce

access policies, such as data about user role, location,
business process considerations, and risk management. EVAS
controls also help grant access beyond computers, allowing
network administrators to provide access through mobile and
IoT devices.
EVAS help enable a network-as-a-sensor approach to
security enforcement, granting or halting access throughout
the extended network, whether from a remote device (VPN),
prior to connecting to network services, or even within the
network itself across sensitive resource pools. EVAS can also
help organizations reduce the endpoint and network attack
surface, limit the scale and scope of an attack, remediate
problem resolution processes, and even harden the network
after an attack has occurred.

For more information about EVAS solutions and
how they can help organizations improve security,
see the Cisco Security blog post, “New White
Paper from Enterprise Strategy Group on the
Evolution of and Need for Secure Network Access.”

Before an attack, EVAS can:

After an attack is detected, EVAS can:

► Identify risky assets. Monitor all assets connected to
the network at any time, identifying non-compliant users,
devices, and applications, and correlate this information with
third-party vulnerability assessment tools.

► Assess endpoint profiles for vulnerabilities. Share
information from the EVAS database with vulnerability
analysis tools, which can help IT operations prioritize a fix.

► Improve risk mitigation. Gather actionable intelligence
that can be shared with other security and network
applications to improve workflows, streamline operations,
and prioritize remediation activity.
► Enforce granular network access policies. Provide
contextual information for granular policy enforcement, and
limit access to sensitive content, assets, or network segments.
During an attack, EVAS can:
► Integrate with advanced network-based threat defense
systems. Share knowledge when malicious activity is
detected for the purpose of correlating attack data endpoint
connections, configurations, and behavior patterns over time.
► Block “kill chain” tactics from compromised systems.
Limit lateral attack movement by stopping compromised
systems from reaching out to policy-controlled, nonauthorized network assets to steal credentials, escalate
privileges, and exfiltrate valuable data.

► Remediate compromised systems. When integrated
with security information and event management (SIEM)
systems, and endpoint security systems, EVAS can
automate fixes and monitor progress.
► Fine-tune access policies and security controls.
Work with networking and security equipment to segment
application traffic or add new firewall rules or IPS signatures.
Unlike overly complex network access controls of the past,
EVAS solutions are business enablers. As organizations
embrace BYOD policies, cloud computing, and mobility
initiatives, gaining visibility, improving context into connected
users and devices, and effectively enforcing security policies
become more imperative. Cisco security experts predict that
CISOs will increasingly turn to EVAS solutions to manage
the complex web of connections among users, devices,
networks, and cloud services.

The Future of Cybersecurity Hinges on
Boardroom Engagement Today
According to the Cisco Security Capabilities Benchmark
Study, 91 percent of organizations have an executive with
direct responsibility for security. But for modern businesses,
security leadership needs to ascend even higher in the
organization: to the boardroom.

inevitable compromise? And perhaps, the most important
question: What else should we know? CIOs need to be
prepared to answer those questions from the board, in
terms that are meaningful to board members, and also
outline business implications.

Recent, massive data breaches involving well-known
companies, more legislation and regulation related to data
security, geopolitical dynamics, and shareholder expectations
are all factors making cybersecurity an agenda item in the
boardroom. A report by the Information Systems Audit and
Control Association (ISACA) revealed that 55 percent of
corporate directors now have to personally understand and
manage cybersecurity as a risk area.13

In a recent interview with FORTUNE magazine,14 Cisco Chief
Security and Trust Officer John Stewart said that the board
asking these types of questions will help spark “an interesting
set of downstream effects” that ultimately will lead to the
security industry maturing. From there, he said, the next vital
step—the hope—will be that manufacturers finally recognize
that they must build security into their products.

This is a positive development, but one that Cisco security
leaders believe is long overdue. In the modern economy,
every company runs on IT. That makes security the business
of every person in the organization, from the chief executive
to the newest hire, and not just personnel with “security” in
their title or job description. Everyone should be accountable,
and learn how not to be a victim.
Cisco security leaders assert that a core component of the
future of cybersecurity will be greater engagement by the
board. Corporate boards of directors across industries need to
know what the cybersecurity risks to the business are and their
potential impact. To truly understand the scope of cybersecurity
issues that affect the organization, some boards may need to
add members with technology and cybersecurity expertise.
Boards also need to start asking tough questions about
security controls: What controls do we have in place?
How well have they been tested? Do we have a reporting
process? How quickly can we detect and remediate the

Stewart predicts that as the Internet of Things (IoT) evolves,
and there are more “people-less devices on the Internet than
people-with devices” there will be inevitable “accidents” of
potentially great magnitude. Designing security into products
will help to avoid many of these issues, or at least, lessen
their impact.
Therefore, the boards of technology manufacturers should
ask their security leaders: Are we building security into our
products? And if not, how soon can we start?

Trust Officer John Stewart on the importance of

Cisco Security Manifesto: Basic Principles for
Achieving Real-World Security

This inaugural security manifesto can help security teams,
and the users in their organizations, to better understand and
respond to the cybersecurity challenges of today’s world.
These principles can serve as a baseline for organizations
as they strive to become more dynamic in their approach to
security, and more adaptive and innovative than adversaries:

3. Security must be transparent and informative. Users
should be presented with information that helps them
understand why security is stopping them from taking a
particular action. They also need to know how they can do
what they want to do safely, instead of bypassing security
in the name of doing their jobs. As an example, when a
user attempts to access a web page and is met with the
message, “Access to this site has been denied by your
administrator,” there is no context as to why they can’t
access the page. But if the message said, “Access to this
site has been denied because it has served malware in
the last 48 hours,” the user would be better informed and
understand the potential risk not only to the organization,
but to them, as an individual user. Security technologies
also should help users to achieve their goals safely through
clear recommendations or by directing them to appropriate
resources for timely assistance.

1. Security must be considered a growth engine for
the business. Security should never be a roadblock or
hassle that undermines user productivity and stands in
the way of business innovation. Yet security teams impose
technological solutions that do exactly that. A primary
reason: They are not invited in time, or at all, to discussions
about business projects that require the deployment of
new technology. However, security professionals are also
guilty of waiting for an invitation they may never receive.
They instead must take proactive steps to ensure they are
involved in technology conversations, and understand how
security processes can enable the organization’s agility and
success, while also protecting its data, assets, and image.

4. Security must enable visibility and appropriate action.
Security solutions with open security architecture enable
security teams to determine whether those solutions are
truly effective. Security professionals also need tools for
automating visibility into the network so they not only can
see traffic, but also the assets that make up the network.
By understanding how security technologies operate, and
what is normal (and not normal) in the IT environment,
security teams can reduce their administrative workload
while becoming more dynamic and accurate in identifying
and responding to threats and adapting defenses. In taking
this approach, security teams can take full advantage of
more relevant and targeted controls to aid in resolution.

2. Security must work with existing architecture, and
be usable. Security teams should not have to build an
architecture to accommodate new technology solutions
that are meant to improve security. Architectures, by
nature, are constraining. Organizations should not have
to change the way they do business to accommodate
new security technologies, or be prevented from making
changes in how they operate because of the technologies
they already have in place. The end result of “architecture
overload” is that users will circumvent security architecture,
leaving the organization less secure. In addition, if a security
technology is too difficult for users to understand, and
must be maintained by hard-to-find, specialized security
talent, it is not useful to the organization.

5. Security must be viewed as a “people problem.” A
technology-centric approach to security does not improve
security; in fact, it exacerbates it. Technologies are merely
tools that can enhance the ability of people to secure their
environment. Security teams need to educate users about
safe habits that they should apply no matter where they
are using technology—at the office, at home, on the road—
so they can make good decisions and feel empowered
to seek timely assistance when they think something is
wrong. Improved dialogue between security professionals
and users will also help users see that technology alone
cannot assure security. People, processes, and technology,
together, must form the defense against today’s threats.
Commitment and vigilance by all users in the organization,
from the top down, empower security success.

Today’s CISOs need to answer hard questions: How do
I make my security team the first point of contact for the
business when potential security issues arise? How can I
ensure my team has the tools and visibility to determine what
security issues are most relevant, and require action? And
how do I keep users—the key to business success—safe, and
not just when they are working on-site?
Cisco security experts suggest that CISOs can address these
questions by implementing and following a set of security
principles known as the Cisco Security Manifesto.

Cisco 2015 Annual Security Report | 4. Changing the View Toward Cybersecurity

45

The Cisco Security Manifesto is a call for a change. In the
real world, security technology, policies, and best practices
should raise the average level of security for everyone in the
organization, and help the business make more informed
risk decisions—down to each individual user. And with strong
principles to guide them, users can gain a clear understanding
of why they are prevented from taking certain actions, and what
the impact likely would be if they decide to bypass security.
The Cisco Security Manifesto, or one that echoes its core
principles, can help both users and security practitioners to
see the “big picture” on security: While many threats can
be avoided, compromise is inevitable—but remediation can
be swift. The goal is to reduce the time to resolution when a
compromise is eventually successful, and not focus solely on
trying to prevent these events.

About Cisco

Cisco delivers intelligent cybersecurity for the real world,
providing one of the industry’s most comprehensive
advanced threat protection portfolios of solutions across the
broadest set of attack vectors. Cisco’s threat-centric and
operationalized approach to security reduces complexity and
fragmentation while providing superior visibility, consistent
control, and advanced threat protection before, during, and
after an attack.

Threat researchers from the Collective Security Intelligence
(CSI) ecosystem bring together, under a single umbrella, the
industry’s leading threat intelligence, using telemetry obtained
from the vast footprint of devices and sensors, public and
private feeds, and the open source community at Cisco.
This amounts to a daily ingest of billions of web requests and
millions of emails, malware samples, and network intrusions.
Our sophisticated infrastructure and systems consume
this telemetry, enabling machine-learning systems and
researchers to track threats across networks, data centers,
endpoints, mobile devices, virtual systems, web, email, and
from the cloud to identify root causes and scope outbreaks.
The resulting intelligence is translated into real-time
protections for our products and services offerings that are
immediately delivered globally to Cisco customers.
