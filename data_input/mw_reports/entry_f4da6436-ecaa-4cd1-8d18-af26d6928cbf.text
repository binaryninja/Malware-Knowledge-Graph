FBI, DHS, HHS Warn of Imminent, Credible Ransomware
Threat Against U.S. Hospitals

On Monday, Oct. 26, KrebsOnSecurity began following up on a tip from a reliable source that
an aggressive Russian cybercriminal gang known for deploying ransomware was preparing
to disrupt information technology systems at hundreds of hospitals, clinics and medical care
facilities across the United States. Today, officials from the FBI and the U.S. Department of
Homeland Security hastily assembled a conference call with healthcare industry executives
warning about an “imminent cybercrime threat to U.S. hospitals and healthcare providers.”

The agencies on the conference call, which included the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services (HHS), warned participants about “credible information of an increased
and imminent cybercrime threat to US hospitals and healthcare providers.”
The agencies said they were sharing the information “to provide warning to healthcare
providers to ensure that they take timely and reasonable precautions to protect their
networks from these threats.”
The warning came less than two days after this author received a tip from Alex Holden,
founder of Milwaukee-based cyber intelligence firm Hold Security. Holden said he saw online
communications this week between cybercriminals affiliated with a Russian-speaking
ransomware group known as Ryuk in which group members discussed plans to deploy
ransomware at more than 400 healthcare facilities in the U.S.
One participant on the government conference call today said the agencies offered few
concrete details of how healthcare organizations might better protect themselves against this
threat actor or purported malware campaign.
“They didn’t share any IoCs [indicators of compromise], so it’s just been ‘patch your systems
and report anything suspicious’,” said a healthcare industry veteran who sat in on the
discussion.
However, others on the call said IoCs may be of little help for hospitals that have already
been infiltrated by Ryuk. That’s because the malware infrastructure used by the Ryuk gang is
often unique to each victim, including everything from the Microsoft Windows executable files
that get dropped on the infected hosts to the so-called “command and control” servers used
to transmit data between and among compromised systems.
Nevertheless, cybersecurity incident response firm Mandiant today released a list of
domains and Internet addresses used by Ryuk in previous attacks throughout 2020 and up
to the present day. Mandiant refers to the group by the threat actor classification “UNC1878,”
and aired a webcast today detailing some of Ryuk’s latest exploitation tactics.
Charles Carmakal, senior vice president for Mandiant, told Reuters that UNC1878 is one of
most brazen, heartless, and disruptive threat actors he’s observed over the course of his
career.
“Multiple hospitals have already been significantly impacted by Ryuk ransomware and their
networks have been taken offline,” Carmakal said.
One health industry veteran who participated in the call today and who spoke with
KrebsOnSecurity on condition of anonymity said if there truly are hundreds of medical
facilities at imminent risk here, that would seem to go beyond the scope of any one hospital
group and may implicate some kind of electronic health record provider that integrates with
many care facilities.

So far, however, nothing like hundreds of facilities have publicly reported ransomware
incidents. But there have been a handful of hospitals dealing with ransomware attacks in the
past few days.
–Becker’s Hospital Review reported today that a ransomware attack hit Klamath Falls, Ore.based Sky Lakes Medical Center’s computer systems.
–WWNY’s Channel 7 News in New York reported yesterday that a Ryuk ransomware attack
on St. Lawrence Health System led to computer infections at Caton-Potsdam, Messena and
Gouverneur hospitals.
–SWNewsMedia.com on Monday reported on “unidentified network activity” that caused
disruption to certain operations at Ridgeview Medical Center in Waconia, Minn. SWNews
says Ridgeview’s system includes Chaska’s Two Twelve Medical Center, three hospitals,
clinics and other emergency and long-term care sites around the metro area.
–NBC5 reports The University of Vermont Health Network is dealing with a “significant and
ongoing system-wide network issue” that could be a malicious cyber attack.
-A story at BleepingComputer.com says Wyckoff Hospital in New York suffered a Ryuk
ransomware attack on Oct. 28.
This is a developing story. Stay tuned for further updates.
Update, 10:11 p.m. ET: The FBI, DHS and HHS just jointly issued an alert about this,
available here.
Update, Oct. 30, 11:14 a.m. ET: Added mention of Wyckoff hospital Ryuk compromise.
