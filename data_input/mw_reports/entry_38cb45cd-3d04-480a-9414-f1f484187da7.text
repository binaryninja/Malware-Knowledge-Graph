Egregor – Prolock: Fraternal Twins ?

Equipe CERT

November 12, 2020

CERT Intrinsec has faced since the beginning of September several cases involving Egregor and Prolock ransomwares. This article aims at
presenting Egregor and Prolock techniques, tactics and procedures, as well as sharing indicators of compromise and highlighting actions of
the threat actor operating both ransomwares, according to collected intelligence and TTPs analysis.
On one hand, Egregor has a similar strategy to other ransomwares, as it exfiltrates data, encrypts files and publishes them on its website in
order to make victims pay the ransom. It is active since the beginning of September 2020 and impacts many sectors from insurance to
transport. Its goal is lucrative.
On the other hand, Prolock, successor of PwndLocker, is active since March 2020. As many other ransomwares, it targets big companies with
ransoms going from 35 to 255 bitcoins (400 000 to 3 000 000 $). Its goal is, as far as we know, only lucrative. Prolock is active mainly in
Northern America and in Europe and impacts several sectors, such as health, construction, finance, legal, etc.

Egregor ransomware analysis

1/9

Initial access
We were not able to find identified specific initial accesses, we found traces of Qakbot during investigations but we could not identify how it
was dropped on information systems. We observed many potential intrusion vectors on patient 0 (many malwares were found on the machine).
Internal reconnaissance
Prior to privilege escalation, Egregor proceeds to Active Directory reconnaissance using tools such as Sharphound or AdFind. These tools are
used to gather information about users, groups, computers, and so on. They aim as well at finding the best compromission paths.
Privilege escalation
During investigations, Egregor compromises Active Directory in order to become domain admin.
Lateral movement
Egregor moves laterally on information systems using CobaltStrike SMB beacons. This feature allows an attacker to use SMB named pipes
(logical connections between a client and a server) to communicate commands through the information system revealing C2 IP address.
The following command line is a service created by CobaltStrike and can be found in Windows Event Logs (event id 7045). It runs an encoded
powershell command.

CobaltStrike service execution
It is possible to deobfuscate CobaltStrike payloads (base64, gunzip and XOR operations) using CyberChef[1]:

CobaltStrike payload deobfuscation
C2 Communication
Once settles on victim’s information systems, Egregor communicates with its Command and Control servers via HTTPS protocol so as to drop
scripts or dynamic link libraries on infected hosts. You can find the list of C2 identified during investigations in section “IP Addresses”.
Data exfiltration
Egregor masquerades svchost.exe process to launch an RClone client in order to exfiltrate data. RClone aims at managing files in cloud, it
deals with multiple systems and protocols. The RClone configuration file, in plain text, is dropped by the attacker with the binary. Based on
investigations and OSINT, we know that Egregor used at least three different configurations to exfiltrate data.

2/9

RClone Configuration File (WebDav)

RClone Configuration File (sFTP)

RClone
Configuration File (DropBox)
Defense evasion
To evade protections, Egregor create a Group Policy Object to disable Windows Defender and try to takedown any anti-virus console prior to
ransomware execution:
Display name: New Group Policy Object
Version: 1
registry.pol content:
Key path: Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender
Data name: DisableAntiSpyware
Value type: 0x04 (REG_DWORD)
Data value: 0x01

Ransomware execution
Egregor downloads custom dynamic link libraries (b.dll, q.dll, etc) using bitsadmin and execute them on victim’s systems to encrypt data.

DLL download and execution

Prolock ransomware analysis
Initial Access
One of the intrusion vectors is malspam. Indeed, Emotet is used to initiate infection on several user workstations and to drop Qakbot. Emotet
used legitimate documents after taking control of some user’s email accounts. These documents contain a payload which tries to download a
binary file from different URLs, as following. On infected systems, after the execution of the binary retrieved by Emotet code, few files are
created (typical Qakbot operation):
\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Jfayae\vatgrcxt.exe
\koyxogldypnalvvlyxpw.exe
\AdFind.exe

Code embedded in the malicious document

3/9

Powershell payload (decoded from base64)

Deobfuscated powershell code (used to download F889k6.exe)
Unfortunately, we were not able to retrieve F889k6.exe neither from compromised systems nor from URLs, which were already down by that
time.
Internal reconnaissance
Prolock proceeds to Active Directory reconnaissance AdFind tool to gather information about users, groups, computers so as to prepare
exfiltration and ransomware execution.
Privilege escalation
During investigations, Prolock compromises Active Directory in order to become domain admin.
Lateral movement
Prolock uses batch scripts to enable RDP on targeted hosts. We found the script below during one of our cases. The same script has already
be found on Prolock cases.
Following actions are performed by the script:
Enable Remote Desktop connections by setting fDenyConnections to 0.
Start Microsoft Protection Service.
Set a rule in Windows firewall to activate RDP service.
Modify RDP-Tcp registry key.

rdp.bat script (enable RDP connections)
Data exfiltration
We did not see any use of RClone during incident responses involving Prolock.

4/9

Ransomware execution
Prolock uses different scripts and files to encrypt victim’s data. It retrieves all these files from 185.238.0[.]233, the latter hosting as well
Egregor dynamic link libraries. The first script wmi_md.bat (wmi_u.bat works the same way) proceeds the following actions on each host
whose IP address is in the file list_md.txt (or list_u.txt):
Connect to the host using a compromised account
Drop connect.bat and office.txt on the host
Execute connect.bat using WMI command-line
Write host IP address in log.dat file
Cancel the network connection

Script deploying ransomware on information system (wmi_md.bat)
In addition, we found a script that uses bitsadmin to download office.txt and connect.bat from 185.238.0[.]233.

Code from eb1.bat
The script connect.bat contains the following encoded powershell payload.

Powershell payload from connect.bat
After decoding and deobfuscating it, we got to know that it is used to load office.txt in memory and execute it.

Decoded and deobfuscated payload
Office.txt analysis is not yet complete, but we believe that it is the ransomware, based on system events correlation.

Relations between Egregor & Prolock
During recent investigations, we observed common indicators of compromise and techniques between Egregor and Prolock. These common
points are presented below:
The IP address 185.238.0[.]233 hosts both Egregor’s dynamic link libraries and Prolock files (especially scripts used to run the
ransomware). You can find more information about Prolock TTP in the next section.
Both WIN-799RI0TSTOF and WIN-4K804V6ADVQ hostnames of potential VPS have been seen during Prolock and Egregor cases.
list_md.txt and list_u.txt files were involved in both Egregor and Prolock cases (of course, their content depends on the victim’s
information system).
The use of bitsadmin in eb*.bat scripts to download dll (Egregor) or scripts (Prolock) is another common point between these threat
actors.

5/9

md.exe binary has been seen on both Egregor and Prolock cases.
Even if we did not notice exfiltration using RClone in our Prolock cases, we know that this threat actor uses it[2].
