APT & Targeted Attacks
What happens in Carbanak and FIN7 attacks? Here are some techniques used by these
financially motivated threat groups that target banks, retail stores, and other establishments.

Constant monitoring of threat groups is one of the ways that security researchers and law
enforcement agencies are able defend systems against cybercrime. Among these
cybercriminals are financially motivated threat groups Carbanak and FIN7. Although both
names have at times been used to refer to the same group, organizations such as MITRE
identifies them as two separate entities that wield the Carbanak backdoor in their attacks.
However, the groups use not just the Carbanak backdoor but also other types of malware
such as Pillowmint, a point-of-sale malware, and Tirion, which is said to be geared to replace
Carbanak.
MITRE also identifies different main targets for each group: While Carbanak focuses on
banking institutions, FIN7 targets food, hospitality, and retail establishments.

This week, the results of this year's round of the MITRE Engenuity ATT&CK Evaluations
were released, which focused on Carbanak+FIN7. We also separately discussed how Trend
Micro solutions deal with these threats.
For more background on what happens in attacks launched by Carbanak and FIN7, we
pieced together information from our studies of these groups as well as information from
ATT&CK tactics and techniques (a total of 65 techniques across 11 tactics) identified by
MITRE to be related to these threat groups.

What happens in Carbanak and FIN7 attacks?
In our analysis of a related past campaign, we observed that attackers enter the system
through spear phishing. After gaining a foothold in the system, the dynamic data exchange
(DDE) feature in Windows and legitimate cloud-based services will then be abused to deliver
the malware or to establish command-and-control (C&C) communication.
After this, the Carbanak backdoor can then be used to log keystrokes and capture
screenshots, steal and delete cookies, inject malicious code on sites, and monitor various
traffic. For lateral movement, the malware abuses remote and system administration tools.
To be more specific in terms of ATT&CK® techniques, Carbanak and FIN7 share a notable
number of similarities. However, some techniques are only used by one of them, as we
discuss in the subsequent sections.

Figure 1. ATT&CK® tactics shared between Carbanak and FIN7
The following are the tactics and techniques that are employed by Carbanak and FIN7, as
shared by MITRE.
Initial Access
Both groups use spear-phishing campaigns with attachments that are embedded with
exploits as an entry point to the target system.
Execution
3/6

Successfully entering the system leads to the next step: executing the attack. For code and
behavior execution, both groups use a variety of techniques through native API, PowerShell,
service execution, user execution, Windows Component Object Model (COM) and
Distributed COM, and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).
Carbanak also abuses command-line interface and DDE client-server protocol.
On the other hand, FIN7 takes advantage of Mshta, a utility that can execute VBScript, and
scheduled tasks to run malicious code on user systems.
Persistence
Once the malicious behavior is executed, the attackers will attempt to keep their presence in
a system. To maintain persistence, the groups create new services. They also add programs
to a startup folder that can be referenced with a registry run key. We detected a variant of the
Carbanak malware that adds registry entries and keys as an autostart technique. Credentials
of existing valid accounts were also abused.
In the case of FIN7, the use of application shimming databases (which can allow developers
to apply fixes to applications without rewriting code) and hooking processes that allow the
modification of program behaviors are some of the techniques that can be applied. The
former has been utilized in a campaign involving the Pillowmint malware.
Privilege Escalation
Some functions that are needed for the attack require admin privileges. To elevate privileges,
the groups bypass Windows User Account Control (UAC) mechanisms, new services, and
valid accounts to elevate process privileges.
For the same purpose, on Linux systems, Carbanak attacks can use sudo, a program that
permits users to execute the programs of a superuser.
FIN7 attacks can and inject code into processes and hijack the search order used to load
DLL files.
Defense Evasion
After a series of malicious behavior, attackers need to remain stealthy and undetected by
using security solutions that can remove threats out of the system. For defense evasion, both
groups create or acquire tools for code signing the malware, or deobfuscate or decode files
or information by using malware functions or utilities in the system. Both groups also employ
masquerading to make features appear benign to security solutions, files or information
obfuscation to make these files and information difficult to discover, software packing to
conceal code, and process injection to evade process-based defense.

Carbanak also performs techniques for disabling security tools, deleting files that are left in
malicious activity, and modifying registry to hide configuration information.
FIN7 utilizes guardrails to restrict execution and abused utilities that allow indirect command
execution that can go past security restrictions. The group also evades virtualization and
sandboxes and injects malicious code into hollowed processes to dodge process-based
defenses.
Credential Access
Some portions of the system are protected by credentials. To steal these, both groups
employed credential dumping and input capture. The former involves credentials that are
usually in the form of hash or clear text, while the latter involves API or web portals.
Carbanak also performs brute force tactics or takes advantage of credentials that are saved
in web browsers.
On the other hand, FIN7 performs hooking.
Discovery
For the discovery phase, the Carbanak and FIN7 campaigns gain more knowledge about the
system by gathering listings of various information: open application windows, running
processes, IP addresses and other network identifiers in remote systems, detailed hardware
and system information, system network configuration and settings, and system owners and
users.
Carbanak also collects information on accounts, files and directories, group permissions, and
registries.
FIN7 gathers information on network shares.
The gathered information can aid in the next step: lateral movement.
Lateral Movement
The groups move through the network and identify key assets and data by logging in via
RDP, copying files to upload adversary tools through remote file copy, and abusing Window
admin shares.
In Carbanak attacks, the groups’ attacks can involve logging into services that accept remote
connections and using stolen password hashes through the “pass the hash” method.
Collection

5/6

After moving through the network and identifying assets to target, the next step would be to
gather key data. At the collection phase, Carbanak and FIN7 campaigns harvest data from
local system sources and through input and screen capture (as performed in a related
campaign using the Tirion malware).
FIN7 attacks can stage collected data in a particular location in preparation for exfiltration.
Command and Control
In both Carbanak and FIN7 attacks, communication with users’ compromised systems is
done through bypassing firewalls or network detection systems via commonly used ports,
using connection proxies to avoid direct connections to the threat group’s infrastructure,
employing the command-and-control channel to remotely copy files from an external system,
blending in with existing network traffic by using standard application layer protocol, and
taking advantage of standard cryptographic protocol to disguise command-and-control traffic.
Carbanak campaigns can also use legitimate programs and remote access software for
command and control. They also employ standard non-application layer protocols for
communication.
Exfiltration
In the final phase of the attack, the groups exfiltrate the stolen data into the normal
communications channel via command-and-control channels.
For FIN7 attack routines, data can be compressed and/or encrypted before being exfiltrated.
ATT&CK® tactics and techniques for Linux were also shared by MITRE.
Continuous vigilance against threat groups is an important aspect of keeping up with — if not
being one step ahead of — threats. Solutions such as Trend Micro Vision One™ provide
visibility, correlated detection, and behavior monitoring across multiple layers: email,
endpoints, servers, cloud workloads.
