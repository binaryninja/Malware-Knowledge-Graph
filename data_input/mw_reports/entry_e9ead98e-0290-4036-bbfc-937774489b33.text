The shadow knows: Malvertising campaigns use
domain shadowing to pull in Angler EK

Most online ads are displayed as a result of a chain of trust, from the publishers to the malicious
advertiser via ad agencies and/or ad networks.
For “traffers” (that is, actors bringing trafﬁc to a malicious destination; for example, exploit kits) that rely
on malvertising, one of the goals is to gain access to a high-proﬁle ad network such as DoubleClick,
Bing Ads, AdTech or AppNexus. A reputable, high-proﬁle ad network provides traffers with access to
higher-quality trafﬁc, and the more reputable an ad network appears, the easier it is for traffers to reach
this target trafﬁc.

Uncovering domain shadowing
In early November, one of those high-proﬁle ad agencies appeared in Proofpoint sensors as “referrer”
to Angler exploit kit. Further investigation by Proofpoint researchers determined that the creative in
question (ad banners) was pointing to content from https://ads.mikeholt[.]com and landing at
www.mikeholt[.]com.".

A disparity in the SSL certiﬁcate used by both servers is the ﬁrst hint that something is suspicious about
this ad.

Figure 3 Shadowed domain SSL certiﬁcate vs legitimate site owner's domain SSL certiﬁcate
Comparison of the SSL certiﬁcates for two domains is a clue that this could be a case of “domain
shadowing” [3].
Domain shadowing is a technique for generating malicious subdomains from a legitimate domain,
typically using stolen registration credentials for the domain owner. With the stolen credentials, the
threat actor can create a large number of fraudulent subdomains (for example, ads.mikeholt[.]com)
below the legitimate domain mikeholt[.]com. (The domain owners for these examples were contacted
as part of this investigation and alerted to the fact that their registration credentials have probably been

compromised.) The attacker can then conﬁgure servers on the fraudulent subdomain to perform ﬁltering
and redirection actions that pull in their preferred exploit kit.

Multiple parallel campaigns
Further investigation identiﬁed other campaigns employing other compromised domains and abused ad
agencies. For example:
adv.mtcharlestonlodge[.]com

An exploit kit out of nowhere
Researchers who have the opportunity to replay this attack in a controlled environment will not be able
to see much without SSL man-in-the-middle capabilities (Fig 6); instead the attack will appear to be
Angler EK materializing ‘out of thin air’.

A look in the SSL tunnel
One of the reasons that malvertising is appealing to threat actors is that the ad agency / network itself
performs a signiﬁcant portion of the targeting, including geo, browser and other options. However, the
malicious ad server also includes ﬁltering settings, and as a result non-targeted clients (such as known

IP address, wrong country) will receive harmless ad code.

Figure 7: Harmless code served by the server if the client does not match the ﬁltering options or if the
campaign is on hold
When a targeted client visits a site served by the infected content delivery network (CDN), the attack
follows these steps:
1. Send a post to ﬁlter proxied trafﬁc.
2. A global JavaScript reads the results of the ﬁltering;
3. If the reply is as expected, decode a bogus GIF (Fig. 8).
4. Check the system using two information disclosure bugs in Microsoft Internet Explorer to avoid
researchers, sandboxes and some security products.
5. Abuse an HTTPS open redirect by DoubleClick. [2]
6. Land the browser on Angler EK without a referrer.

Figure 8: Malicious code sent by the fake ad server, including fake GIF image ﬁle
Decoding the fake GIF produces a JavaScript function (Fig. 9).

Client ﬁltering
The decoded JavaScript function leverages two information disclosure bugs in Internet Explorer in
order to ﬁltering potential victims. (Fig. 10)

In order, these checks are:
A variation of a technique used by Magnitude and Angler EKs and is used to ﬁlter the client by
certain security products.
A MimeType check in order to ﬁlter certain shellex associations, including .py, .pcap and .saz
(Fig. 10).
Both of these bugs were reported to Microsoft in May.
All replay attempts of this threat revealed ﬁleless Angler EK [4] [5] threads loading Bedep in memory.
The Bedep in action is "buildId" 1926. Over the course of November, Proofpoint researchers have
observed this Bedep version loading a variety of malware payloads including Fileless Ursnif [4],
Ramnit, Blowcrypt, some Vawtrak campaigns 13 and 60 [7], and most recently Reactor Bot.

Conclusion
Malvertising is by now a well-known attack vector and organizations, web sites, and ad network

operators have adapted their defenses to detect and defend against it. As this example, shows,
however, threat actors are also evolving their techniques, using more sophisticated attack chains that
make it more difﬁcult for even diligent ad agencies and ad network operators to detect malvertising in
their ad streams. These adaptations will enable malvertising to remain an effective malware distribution
method for months to come.
