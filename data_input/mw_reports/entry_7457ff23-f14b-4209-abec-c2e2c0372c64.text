INTRODUCTION
Taiwan and the Philippines have become the targets
of an ongoing campaign called “Operation Tropic
Trooper.” Active since 2012, the attackers behind
the campaign have set their sights on the Taiwanese
government as well as a number of companies in
the heavy industry. The same campaign has also
targeted key Philippine military agencies. Though
the motivations behind the operation are still unclear,
the tools and tactics used reveal potential areas of
weakness both countries should look into.

Operation Tropic Trooper took advantage of two of
the most-exploited Windows® vulnerabilities to date—
CVE-2010-3333 and CVE-2012-0158—to infiltrate
their chosen networks. Part of its success could be
attributed to the use of basic steganography or image
file attachments laced with malicious code, combined
with clever social engineering.
This research paper provides in-depth technical
information on Operation Tropic Trooper’s targets,
components, tools, and tactics.*

Targets
Malware used in Operation Tropic Trooper shared similar characteristics
with those used in attacks targeting various organizations in Vietnam and
India as early as 2011. [1]
Operation Tropic Trooper targets government institutions, military
agencies, and companies in the heavy industry in Taiwan and the
Philippines. [2]

Operation Tropic Trooper

Research Paper

Campaign
Components
Point of Entry
The actors behind Operation
Tropic Trooper used spearphishing emails with weaponized
attachments to exploit old
vulnerabilities, particularly CVE2010-3333 and CVE-20120158. [3–5] These bugs have
been two of the most exploited
vulnerabilities since their
discovery. [6–7]
To infiltrate target networks, the
Spear-phishing email sample
attackers relied on crafty social
engineering tricks. They used
contextually relevant subjects, content, and aptly named attachments
such as “Statement” to convince chosen recipients to download and
open the files supposedly sent for review.
The following filenames were also used:
•

3AD 28 March 2013, SI re ASG Plan Bombing in Zamboanga
City.doc

•

Opening the attachment runs an embedded malicious
executable file, normally a downloader that accesses
a malicious site to download an image file. Some
attachments open decoy documents to hide their
malicious nature.

Sample decoy documents (left: for Filipino targets; right:
for Taiwanese targets)

Initial Payload: TROJ_YAHOYAH
The downloader typically attached to emails related to
Operation Tropic Trooper is detected by Trend Micro
as TROJ_YAHOYAH, a downloader with 32- and 64bit support. It has an encrypted configuration file and
uses HTTP GET requests to download other files that
are then decrypted and executed in memory.

3 | Page

Installation Routine
When executed, TROJ_YAHOYAH checks if the
infected system’s Windows OS is 64-bit capable or
not. If it is, the Trojan will decrypt a 64-bit copy of itself
using a simple XOR cipher with a single-byte key at
“0x90.”
If the infected system
is not 64-bit capable,
the Trojan will just drop
a 32-bit executable
copy of itself (%APP
DATA%\Microsoft\
Credentials\Credentials.
exe, detected as
TROJ_YAHOYAH),
along with an encrypted
configuration file
(%APP DATA%\
Microsoft\Credentials\
Code that decrypts the
Credentials.dat). The
configuration file using
configuration file was
“0x95,0x99,0x9d,0xc3,0xc7,
encrypted using the
0xcb,0xd7,0xe5,0xbd,0xa9,
same simple algorithm
0xb5,0xeb,0xf7,0xe3,0xe7,
featured in the
previously cited Rapid7 0xed” as key
report on KeyBoy.
Unlike the KeyBoy Trojan though, which searches
for the string, “IJUDHSDJFKJDE,” TROJ_YAHOYAH
searches for “MDDEFGEGETGIZ.” These strings,
found at the beginning of the decrypted code,
represent the configuration file. Absence of the said
file terminates the infection process.

NA: Checks for the system’s hostname

•

VR: Hard-coded string only used when
accessing download sites to track which
downloader was used on a target.

TROJ_YAHOYAH’s decrypted configuration file

TROJ_YAHOYAH’s configuration file, when
decrypted, contains the links to sites from which it can
download the files it needs to continue its routines.
After decryption, it executes a dropped copy using the
-Embedding parameter then attempts to delete itself.
The downloader’s name was inspired by its selfdeletion routine after dropping its payload. YAHOYAH
was derived from the Visayan term “hayohay,” which
loosely translates to an easily discarded “servant” in
English. [8]

Download Routine
TROJ_YAHOYAH attempts to access links and
download files via HTTP GET requests. To move to
another attack phase, it uses the following user-agent
strings:

TROJ_YAHOYAH temporarily saves downloaded files
in a specially created folder named “%APP DATA%\
tasks\up{random characters}.msi.”

Sample .MSI file opened on Microsoft Paint

Sample .MSI file with a malicious .JPG header

The image is supposed to be an 800 x 600 wallpaper
that is way heavier than the real one named “Wind.
jpg” normally found in Windows XP systems’
%WINDOWS%\wallpaper\web folder. The actors
behind Operation Tropic Trooper may be using
a simple steganography technique to mask the
backdoor’s routines in order to evade antimalware
and network perimeter detection. [9] We have seen
the actors use other images found in the same folder
such as “Ascent.jpg,” “Friend.jpg,” and “Home.jpg.”

A more in-depth analysis
of the downloaded file
reveals that malicious
code has been
appended to it. This
allows TROJ_YAHOYAH
to check offset 0x0F
bytes from the end of
the file code to identify
a marker where the
malicious binary code
will be added, thus
increasing the file’s size.
TROJ_YAHOYAH
looks for the string,
“EHAGBPSL,” and
decrypts the appended
binary code. When
decrypted, an .EXE file
is executed in memory. It
automatically runs if the
user has administrator
privileges. If the user has Other images used in
limited privileges though, attacks
it will first attempt to
obtain administrator privileges by bypassing User
Account Control (UAC) but only on Windows 7. It will
then decrypt another XOR-encrypted file using the
key “0x90” in memory then check if the “StartWork”
function was exported then execute it.

Malicious code appended to that of the .JPG file

Maintaining Persistence
The last file that TROJ_YAHOYAH executes in
memory is the main installer. It contains two more files
that install a .DLL file detected as TROJ_YAHAMAM.
This file is registered as a service named “INCS” to
maintain persistence. It also drops the following XORencrypted malware-laced image files:
•

% windows %\System32\mfc41.dll (detected
as TROJ_YAHAMAM)

•

% windows %\inf\mfc41.inf (a configuration
file)

•

% windows %\Fonts\mfc41.tff (a copy of the
configuration file)

•

%windows%\Web Wallpaper\images.jpg
(contains BKDR_YAHAMAM)

A batch (.BAT) file is used to start the INCS service.
TROJ_YAHAMAM uses a trick similar to that of
TROJ_YAHOYAH in order to decrypt files. When
decrypted, TROJ_YAHAMAM executes the backdoor
payload.

© 2015 Trend Micro Incorporated

Backdoor Payload: BKDR_
YAHAMAM
BKDR_YAHAMAM is usually encrypted then
embedded in an image file. When decrypted, it is
loaded and executed in memory by a .DLL file that
is registered as a service (TROJ_YAHAMAM). It
exfiltrates data from infected systems, downloads and
uploads files, and has a remote shell. It also drops
a rootkit component named “usb.sys,” detected as
RTKT_HIDEPORT.ZTCA-XO. The rootkit creates
the service, usb30, and hides evidence of port
communication to evade detection and remain
persistent.

Command-and-Control
Communication
When executed, BKDR_YAHAMAM checks if it runs
under svchost.exe. It uses the configuration file,
%windows %\Fonts\mfc41.tff, which contains the
following information:
•

C&C1

•

C&C2

•

C&C3

•

ControlPort

•

DownloadURL1

•

DownloadURL2

•

DownloadURL3

•

LoginPass (for authentication purposes)

•

Port1

•

Port2

•

Port3

•

•

UserMark

BKDR_YAHAMAM encrypts C&C communication
using multiplication with a 1-byte key. Attackers can
use the “?” and “Help” commands to see the various
options the backdoor offers as shown in its code.

Tool used to emulate command-and-control (C&C)
communication with a 64-bit version of BKDR_
YAHAMAM

We were able to download some files from two of the
C&C servers that TROJ_YAHAMAM accesses. These
had some image files that the 32- and 64-bit versions
of the backdoor can choose from for use in attacks.

BKDR_YAHAMAM can steal practically any type of file saved on infected systems. Apart from stealing data,
it can also perform more harmful actions like kill processes and services, delete files and directories, and put
systems to sleep, among others.
BKDR_YAHAMAM also attempts to install an accompanying executable rootkit (%windows %\system32\
drivers\usb30.sys, detected as RTKT_HIDEPORT.ZTCA-XO). RTKT_HIDEPORT.ZTCA-XO is also XOR
encrypted and found at byte key, “0x90,” to hide the port that the backdoor should use according to the
configuration file. It will only hide communication activities occurring in the first of three port entries indicated in
the configuration file. After creating and starting the rootkit service, BKDR_YAHAMAM then attempts to delete
the rootkit and the related service. This will not stop the rootkit from running in the background.
BKDR_YAHAMAM variants with rootkits for 32-bit systems run on 32-bit versions of Windows XP. On Windows
7 64-bit systems, however, the backdoor works but the rootkit does not.

Lateral Movement
In the course of doing research, we also managed to get hold of the following tools that the actors behind
Operation Tropic Trooper used in an attack:
•

HKTL_GETOS: Detects a target system’s OS version. [10]

•

HKTL_SHARESCAN: Performs the following:
 -pr: Scans for open ports on target systems.
 -letmein: Scans for saved usernames and passwords on
target systems.
 -arp: Views the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) on each
target system.
 -netview: Scans target systems for shared resources.

routine

HKTL_SHARESCAN’s routines (top left: -pr; top right: -letmein; bottom left: -arp; bottom right: -netview

These hacking tools were possibly remotely downloaded by the attackers onto infected systems. They aided in
lateral movement and further intelligence gathering. Data such as credentials saved on infected systems can
be stolen via Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning or main-in-the-middle (MiTM) Layer 2 and passthe-hash attacks. [11–12] The stolen credentials allow attackers laterally move throughout a network. The threat
actors no longer have to hack their way in, they have the ability to log in as legitimate users.

CONCLUSION
Operation Tropic Trooper is not highly sophisticated.
But the fact that it has attained some degree of
success and has managed to infiltrate crucial
organizations in both Taiwan and the Philippines
shows the urgent need for targeted entities to rectify
their shortcomings in terms of security.
As with other targeted attacks, Operation Tropic
Trooper brings great risks, especially since its
targets include government institutions and military
agencies. Although we were not able to collect
enough information to determine the identities and
motivations of the actors behind Operation Tropic
Trooper, we were able to gather enough intelligence
to help potential victims defend against the campaign.
Knowing that attackers are still using old techniques
and exploiting known vulnerabilities will make it easier

for the targeted organizations to pinpoint and fix
security gaps in their networks.
Building threat intelligence is crucial in the fight
against targeted attacks. Identifying the tools,
tactics, and procedures (TTPs) that threat actors
use based on external reports and internal historical
and current monitoring can help create a strong
database of indicators of compromise (IoCs) that can
serve as basis for action. Using the right tools for
advanced threat protection should also be part of an
expanded security monitoring strategy. This includes
establishing and empowering incident response
teams and training employees, partners, and vendors
on social engineering and computer security. [14]
