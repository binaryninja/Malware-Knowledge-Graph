Recently, 360 Security Center has detected that a new banking Trojan BBtok has become
popular in Mexico through its file-less attack protection function. The Trojan sends a
compressed package containing malicious lnk files to users through phishing emails or other
means. When the user clicks on the malicious lnk, the carried powershell script will be
activated to execute subsequent attack payloads.
The overall virus operation process is as follows:

The content of the opened pdf is as follows:

After BBtok is deployed on the victim’s machine, it will run a backdoor module. The attacker
can execute different malicious functions by issuing control commands, including creating a
false bank security detection window to trick the user into entering login credentials, thereby
stealing the user’s account password.

File-less Attack
The file of Lnk carries malicious powershell commands to trick the user into clicking, activate
the malicious code, download and execute the subsequent malicious payload:

Base64 encrypted and stored the downloaded shellcode. After decryption, it is a Loader
written by .Net.

Persistence
Loader will replace winmm.dll in the system directory to realize virus residency and self-start:

Winmm.dll loads malicious dynamic libraries:

Anti-virus
Loader will then load the anti-virus driver. When the user is a 64-bit system, it uses the open
source KDU (Kernel Driver Utility) to load:

KDU (https://github.com/hfiref0x/KDU) uses a vulnerable driver of legitimate software to
access arbitrary kernel memory with read/write attributes:

The loaded confrontation driver will violently enumerate and remove all registry callbacks:

Then delete all the registry entries of mainstream anti-virus software to make the anti-virus
software invalid:

BBtok extracts the main backdoor control program from the compressed package. Hackers
can control the victim’s machine by issuing the backdoor instructions in the picture, including
window control, process management, key logger, clipboard hijacking and other functions.

Banker Trojan
Hackers can also choose to simulate different bank false security verification interfacs
through backdoor control commands, and steal user login credentials for Santander,
BanBajio, ScotiaBank, AFIRME, Banregio, Banco Azteca, Multiva, Inbursa, HSBC, Banorte,
CitiBanamex, BBVA, etc.
