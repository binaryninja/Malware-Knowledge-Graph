WHY ATTACKER TOOLSETS
DO WHAT THEY DO
(or.. “Reasons they just keep working”)

Matt McCormack

OVER THE LAST YEAR
50+ engagements
Good chunk of different verticals, industries, etc.
Varying qualities and effectiveness of defenses
Collective noun of different Threat Groups
… but really? Similar tools and tactics

THE MAGIC OF INTERPRETIVE DANCE
Pick through this year’s interesting engagements
Construct a convenient narrative
Discuss the common blind-spots the tools keep
leveraging
Explore Reasons They Just Keep Working (RIJKW)

OUR SCENARIO

RTJKW #1: AD HOC DEPLOYMENTS
Deploy and forget (bonus: default configurations)
External teams not looping in the security team
Third-party systems without patch management
Cloud infrastructure: the new frontier of terrible

THE VOLUME GAME
Scan and exploit; because eventually it will work

CHINACHOPPER POST
Webshell all the things

OWA: WHO NEEDS THE DC?
ISAPI filter (.NET)
OwaAuth.Application_EndRequest()
- Receives request after submitted
- Extract username and password from login, save to
text file
- Parse traffic for magic key, password, and params for
backdoor

OwaAuth.ShowError()
-

List, read, write, delete, modify, files and directories
Timestomp file or directory
Download file from URL
Launch process
Connect, query, write to SQL server

OUR SCENARIO… SO FAR

ACEHASH: ALL THE HASHES
Mimikatz

Custom-compiled PE executes sekurlsa::
logonpasswords command automatically

Ace1

Custom DLL, uses samsrv.dll APIs to dump hashes
from disk/registry

Ace2

Custom DLL, based on WCE, uses msv1_0.dll APIs for
LM/NTLM

InjectMemDll

Inject above when required

OUR SCENARIO… SO FAR

RTJKW #2: CREDENTIAL “ISSUES”
Golden images are convenient, as is scripting installs
Same local Admin passwords is … not great
Failing to restrict local Admin over network
Insecurely storing passwords on network

"whoami"
"ipconfig" /all
"net" time /domain
"net" start query
"netstat" -an
"ping" -n 1 www.nba.com
"net" view /domain
"net" localgroup administrators
"net" user adm_it /domain
"cmd" /c dir C:\users\
"net" group "Domain Admins" /domain
"C:\Windows\system32\net1 group "Domain Admins" /domain
"nltest" /trust_domain

OUR SCENARIO… SO FAR

RTJKW #3: BOTTLENCK BRO?
Chokepoints using (authenticating) proxies
Central point to log, gather/apply intel, block, etc.
Many basic RATs/Toolsets/Malware won’t work
Unfettered internet access is a terrible idea

POISON IVY
Grandfather of Chinese targeted RATs (circa 2004)
Custom TCP C&C protocol
Still deployed, updated but only basic proxy support
seen this year
Volatility + Chopshop + metasploit modules available

OUR SCENARIO… SO FAR

RTJKW #4: DOMAIN SEPARATION
Strict separation, limited accounts, hardcore logging
Extends to shared infrastructure, third parties, BYOD
Trying to avoid these points being like those really
fun ball pits, but for privileged credentials

OUR SCENARIO… SO FAR

RTJKW #5: POROUS FIREWALLS
Don’t forget about the non-TCP protocols
Unit test and regression test the perimeter
Segmentation is a thing

EXPOSING YOUR BITS
Windows update component for file transfer

PLUGX
Been around since 2011, actively developed
Modular construction to evade sandboxing, etc.
C&C via UDP, DNS over UDP, CUSTOM over TCP,
HTTP, HTTPS, ICMP, customer over IP
Plugin infrastructure

PLUGINS
- Read/write/enumerate files, registry
- Download/execute files
- Enumerate, read, write, inject, kill processes
- Port forward/proxy traffic, enumerate network
- Full SQL driver interface
- RDP, keylog, screenshot, video ..

OUR SCENARIO… SO FAR

RIJKW #6: INTERNAL BLINDNESS
Some visibility inside the network is … useful
Common for newer RATs to have P2P
Routing traffic through the network to reach other
targets

RBDOOR
Alternative to PlugX, full RAT functionality too
Both 64 and 32 bit versions
C&C via TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS, ...
Traffic relay is also built in ...

RBDOOR ROUTING
Everything done via IP/TCP header modification
Main functionality:
- Drop packets from blacklist
- Route packets to new destination port in whitelist
- Capture session cookies by routing to magic port

NOT EVEN NORTON DSE WILL SAVE YOU
Sometimes you just want to load your dodgy network
driver on an x64 system
DSE from Vista onwards “stops” that
Unless … it doesn’t?

OUR SCENARIO… SO FAR

TL; DR
“APT”s - mostly not very A, but usually very P
80/20 of network security will thwart the average
intruder
The adversary reuses tools and tactics; if they get in,
you should have home ground advantage. Use it.
