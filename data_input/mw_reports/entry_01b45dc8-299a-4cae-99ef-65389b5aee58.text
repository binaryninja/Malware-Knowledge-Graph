Elastic Security Labs details a recent ICEDID GZip variant

ICEDID is a malware family first described in 2017 by IBM X-force researchers and is
associated with the theft of login credentials, banking information, and other personal
information. ICEDID has always been a prevalent family, but has achieved even more
growth since EMOTET’s temporary disruption in early 2021. ICEDID has been linked to the
distribution of other distinct malware families including DarkVNC and COBALT STRIKE.
Regular industry reporting, including research publications like this one, help mitigate this
threat.
Elastic Security Labs analyzed a recent ICEDID variant consisting of a loader and bot
payload. By providing this research to the community end-to-end, we hope to raise
awareness of the ICEDID execution chain, highlight its capabilities, and deliver insights
about how it is designed.

Execution Chain
ICEDID employs multiple stages before establishing persistence via a scheduled task and
may retrieve components from C2 dynamically. The following diagram illustrates major
phases of the ICEDID execution chain.

Research Paper Overview
Elastic Security Labs described the full execution chain of a recent ICEDID sample in a
detailed research paper hosted at Elastic Security Labs. In addition, we provide a
comprehensive analysis of this malware sample and capabilities, including:
Virtualization detection and anti-analysis
C2 polling operations
Shellcode execution methods
Credential access mechanisms
Websocket connections
Installing a web browser proxy to capture all user traffic
Reverse shell and VNC server installation
Certificate pinning
Data validation
ICEDID observable TTPs
