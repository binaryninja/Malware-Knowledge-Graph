Executive Summary
Emotet is one of the most prolific email-distributed malware families in our current threat
landscape. Although a coordinated law enforcement effort shut down this malware in
January 2021, Emotet resumed operations in November 2021. Since then, Emotet has
returned to its status as a prominent threat.
This blog provides a background on Emotet, and it reviews activity from this malware family
since its return in November 2021. The information covers changes in Emotet operations
from its revival through the end of January 2022. These examples will provide a more
comprehensive picture and better indicate the worldwide threat Emotet currently poses.

Background on Emotet
Sometimes referred to as Geodo or Feodo, Emotet is Windows-based malware that first
appeared in 2014 as a banking Trojan. Since then, Emotet has evolved into modular
malware that performs various functions, including information stealing, spambot activity and
loading other malware.
The threat actor behind Emotet is known through different designators, like Mealybug,
MUMMY SPIDER or TA542.
Emotet’s primary method of distribution is through email.
Emotet is a prolific spammer. Emotet-infected computers often act as spambots, sending a
dozen or more emails every minute that push more Emotet. This means thousands of
Emotet emails can be sent by a single host every day. If hundreds of Emotet-infected hosts
are active at any given time, this means hundreds of thousands of Emotet emails can be
generated each day Emotet is actively spamming.

2/27

Emotet is evasive. Through a technique called hashbusting, Emotet generates different file
hashes for malware distributed through its botnets. This ensures a malware sample’s
SHA256 hash is different on each infected system. Emotet also uses obfuscated code in
scripts used during its initial infection process.
Emotet is nimble. Its botnets frequently update IP addresses and TCP ports used for
command and control (C2) communications. Emotet also frequently changes URLs hosting
its malware, sometimes using dozens of different URLs each day.
Emails distributing Emotet contain malicious attachments, or they contain links to malicious
files. These messages most often contain Microsoft Office files like Word documents or Excel
spreadsheets. These Office documents contain malicious macro code. The code is designed
to infect a vulnerable Windows host after a victim enables macros.
As it rose to prominence, Emotet began distributing other malware like Gootkit, IcedID,
Qakbot and Trickbot.
By September 2019, Emotet's infrastructure was running on three separate botnets. These
botnets were designated by the security research team Cryptolaemus as epoch 1, epoch 2
and epoch 3. The epoch designators are often abbreviated as E1, E2 and E3.
By 2020, a significant portion of malicious spam pushing Emotet used thread hijacking.
Thread hijacking is a technique that utilizes legitimate messages stolen from infected
computers' email clients. Emotet emails have frequently spoofed legitimate users and
impersonated replies to these stolen emails.
Emotet occasionally takes a break from delivering malicious emails. Emotet's longest
absence from the threat landscape occurred in early February 2020 and lasted more than
five months. Emotet resumed operations in mid-July 2020, and it quickly surpassed other
threats in sheer volume of malicious spam.
In January 2021, a collaborative effort by law enforcement agencies and other authorities
disrupted Emotet operations. This effectively stopped the threat actor, and Emotet
disappeared from our threat landscape.
Approximately 10 months later, Emotet resumed operations in mid-November 2021.

Visual Timeline
Figure 1 presents a timeline of Emotet operations from its return in mid-November 2021
through January 2022. The timeline highlights notable Emotet activity during the three month
period covered in this blog.

Emotet in November 2021
On Sunday, Nov. 14, 2021, security researcher Luca Ebach discovered a new Emotet binary
delivered through a Trickbot infection. By Monday, Nov. 15, the Emotet infrastructure had
resumed normal operations and began generating a large volume of malicious spam.
The new Emotet infrastructure is running on two separate botnets designated as epoch 4
and epoch 5. These designators are often abbreviated as E4 and E5.
On Nov. 15, malicious spam for Emotet had one of three types of attachments: a passwordprotected ZIP archive, a Word document or an Excel spreadsheet. This follows the same
method we had typically seen with previous Emotet infections. Examples and more details
can be found in my post, “Emotet Returns.” See Figure 2 for a flow chart documenting the
chain of events.

Appendix A lists indicators of compromise from an infection on Wednesday, Nov. 18.
By Monday, Nov. 23, a batch file was added to the infection process as shown below in
Figure 3.

Figure 3. Chain of events for Emotet infections seen on Monday, Nov. 23, 2021.
Emotet targets include various areas around the world. But even if victims are non-English
speakers, templates for the Office documents are still in English as shown below in Figures 4
and 5 from an email targeting Italy.

Figure 5. Attachment from Italian email contained Excel spreadsheet for Emotet with an
English template.
At this time, enabling macros did not directly download and run the Emotet DLL. Instead, the
macro code dropped a batch file shown in Figure 6 and ran it with the following command:
C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe /c c:\programdata\sdfhiuwu.bat

7/27

Figure 6. Batch file dropped after enabling macros for an Emotet infection on Nov. 23, 2021.
As an evasion technique, obfuscated script in the batch file generates a PowerShell
command to retrieve an Emotet DLL and run it on the victim’s host. The PowerShell
command uses a base64-encoded string as shown below in Figure 7.

8/27

Figure 7. PowerShell command using base64 encoded string.
Converting the base64 string to ASCII text reveals the script shown below in Figure 8. This
script is designed to retrieve an Emotet DLL from one of seven URLs and save it to the
C:\ProgramData\ directory. The Emotet DLL is run with rundll32.exe using a random string of
characters as the entry point.

Figure 8. Deobfuscated script from the base64 string in Figure 4.

9/27

The new Emotet DLL is similar to Emotet DLLs before the January 2021 takedown. Emotet is
made persistent under a randomly named folder under the infected user’s
AppData\Local\Temp directory. The modified date of the persistent DLL is backdated exactly
one week prior to the infection. Emotet is made persistent through a Windows Registry
update. Figure 9 shows an example from Nov. 23.

Figure 9. Registry update to keep Emotet persistent after a reboot.
Since Emotet reappeared in November 2021, post-infection C2 activity consists of encrypted
HTTPS traffic. Certificate issuer data for Emotet C2 HTTPS traffic uses generic values often
seen with other malware families. Figure 10 shows an example of Emotet C2 activity filtered
in Wireshark to reveal the certificate issuer data.

10/27

Figure 10. Reviewing certificate issuer data of Emotet HTTPS C2 traffic in Wireshark.
As shown above in Figure 10, certificate issuer data for Emotet C2 HTTPS traffic is:
id-at-countryName=GB
id-at-statOrProvinceName=London
id-at-localityName=London
id-at-organizationName=Global Security
id-at-organizationalUnitName=IT Department
id-at-commonName=example.com
Of note, other malware families have used similar certificate issuer data, so this is not
necessarily unique to Emotet.
On Nov.r 30, Emotet switched tactics again and began abusing Microsoft’s App Installer as
part of its infection chain.

Emotet Abuses Microsoft App Installer
Now disabled by Microsoft, App Installer is a protocol for Windows 10 used to install software
directly from a web server, and it used XML-based app installer files with the extension
.appinstaller. This protocol had been previously abused for BazarLoader malware attacks in
November 2021. Figure 11 shows the flow chart for this type of Emotet infection.

11/27

Figure 11. Flow chart for Emotet infections abusing Microsoft’s App Installer Protocol.
The attack technique starts with complaint report-themed emails with links to malicious
pages. These malicious pages are hosted on compromised websites, and they spoof Google
Drive by using the same style of Google Drive pages, including a Google Drive icon that
appears in the browser tab. The pages have links to supposedly preview a PDF-based
complaint report. The link actually leads to a malicious .appinstaller file designed to infect a
vulnerable Windows 10 host with Emotet.
Below, Figure 12 shows a thread-hijacked email from Nov. 30 with the malicious link, and
Figure 13 shows the associated complaint page with a link to the malicious .appinstaller file.

13/27

Figure 13. Fake complaint report page with link to .appinstaller file for Emotet.
As shown above in Figure 13, the .appinstaller file pretends to be an Adobe PDF component.
In this case, criminals were abusing Microsoft Azure to host the malicious files. Below, Figure
14 shows a malicious .appinstaller file opened in a text editor.

Figure 14. Malicious .appinstaller file used for Emotet on Nov. 30.
The malicious .appinstaller file shown above in Figure 14 retrieves a malicious ZIP archive
appended with an .appxbundle file extension from the same server. Below, Figure 15 shows
contents of the malicious .appxbundle.

14/27

Figure 15. Malicious .appxbundle used for Emotet infection on Nov. 30.
The malicious .appxbundle impersonating an Adobe program contains various files including
ZIP archives with an .appx file extension. Together, the entire .appxbundle is designed to
retrieve an Emotet DLL and run it on a vulnerable Windows host.
Indicators and further details from the Nov. 30 activity can be found at Malware Traffic
Analysis. Due to the nature of these app installer files, this infection method was initially
difficult to detect. Fortunately, Microsoft quickly shut down Azure file servers hosting the app
installer files. Microsoft has also disabled the app installer protocol, so this no longer remains
an avenue of attack for Emotet or other malware.
Appendix B lists indicators of compromise from an Emotet infection abusing Microsoft’s App
Installer on Nov. 30.

Emotet in December 2021
Throughout November 2021, examples of Emotet infections revealed data exfiltration and
spambot activity. No indicators of followup malware were publicly reported until December
2021. By Dec. 7, the Cryptolaemus research team confirmed Cobalt Strike had been
deployed to Emotet-infected Windows hosts.
December 2021 saw at least one more wave of emails from Emotet attempting to abuse
Microsoft’s App Installer protocol. However, Emotet quickly moved on to other infection
patterns and used different templates for Office documents, mostly Excel spreadsheets.
In the week leading to Christmas day, Emotet emails contained links to web pages on
various compromised websites. These pages also pretended to be from Google Drive, and
they had links to download malicious Excel files. In this case, Emotet started using a new
infection pattern as shown in Figure 16.
15/27

Figure 16. Emotet infection pattern seen from Dec. 21-Dec. 24.
Above, Figure 16 reveals a process Emotet occasionally used through at least February
2022. We previously reported details on one such variation from January. Appendix C lists
indicators of compromise from an Emotet infection using this method on Dec. 21.
Below, Figure 17 shows an email from Dec. 23 pushing Emotet, Figure 18 displays the
website from the email link, and Figure 19 reveals the downloaded Excel spreadsheet.

On Thursday, Dec. 24, we saw similar emails with Christmas-themed subject lines and
holiday wishes in the message text. This wave of emails delivered the same style of Excel
spreadsheet shown above in Figure 19.
Below, Figure 20 shows one of these Christmas-themed emails, and Figure 21 displays the
associated web page that delivered an Excel spreadsheet.

After Dec. 24, Emotet stopped spamming until after the new year.

Emotet in January 2022
On Tuesday, Jan. 11, 2022, Emotet resumed spamming after its holiday break. The emails
continued with links to fake complaint pages, and the pages were sometimes customized to
include the recipient’s name. This method was prevalent until Jan. 20.
Figures 22-24 show one such example from Jan. 20. In this example, the recipient’s name
has been sanitized to read as “Solomon Grundy” with an AOL email address, and the
spoofed sender has been sanitized to read as alan.scott@thegreenlantern[.]net.

Appendix D lists indicators of compromise from an Emotet infection using this method on
Jan. 11.
By Friday, Jan. 21, Emotet emails went back to using attached Excel spreadsheets or
password-protected ZIP archives containing Excel spreadsheets. Throughout the rest of the
month, Excel spreadsheets for Emotet alternated between the template shown above in
Figure 24 and the template shown below in Figure 25.

21/27

Figure 25. Excel spreadsheet template seen during the last full week of January 2022.
In January, we continued to see reports of Emotet pushing Cobalt Strike. During our lab
tests, we routinely saw Emotet-infected hosts generate spambot activity starting from 35-45
minutes after the initial infection.

Conclusion
Since its return in November 2021, Emotet has once again become one of the most prolific
malware families in our current threat landscape. Hundreds of thousands of emails can be
generated each day Emotet is actively spamming. Hashbusting, code obfuscation and other
evasion techniques make Emotet a significant threat.
Windows users can lower their risk from Emotet through spam filtering, proper system
administration and ensuring their software is patched and up to date. Palo Alto Networks
customers are further protected from Emotet through Cortex XDR and our Next-Generation
Firewall with WildFire and Threat Prevention subscriptions.
Palo Alto Networks has shared these findings, including file samples and indicators of
compromise, with our fellow Cyber Threat Alliance members. CTA members use this
intelligence to rapidly deploy protections to their customers and to systematically disrupt
malicious cyber actors. Learn more about the Cyber Threat Alliance.

Indicators of Compromise

22/27

Due to hashbusting, daily changes in malware URLs and frequent changes for infection
patterns, we can see hundreds of new indicators for Emotet every day. These indicators are
too numerous and changes are too frequent to be useful in any single list. However,
abuse.ch is a research project that provides free trackers for Emotet botnet command and
control servers, URLs hosting Emotet malware and Emotet malware samples.
Appendices A, B, C and D provide a small selection of indicators referenced in this blog post.
