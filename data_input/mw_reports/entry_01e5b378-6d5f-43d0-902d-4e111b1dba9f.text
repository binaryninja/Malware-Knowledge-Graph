Introduction:
Prevailion’s Adversarial Counterintelligence Team (PACT) is using advanced infrastructure
hunting techniques and Prevailion’s unparalleled visibility into threat actor infrastructure
creation to uncover previously unknown domains associated with UNC1151 and the
“Ghostwriter” influence campaign. UNC1151 is likely a state-backed threat actor [1] waging
an ongoing and far-reaching influence campaign that has targeted numerous countries
across Europe. Their operations typically display messaging in general alignment with the
security interests of the Russian Federation; their hallmarks include anti-NATO messaging,
intimate knowledge of regional culture and politics, and strategic influence operations (such
as hack-and-leak operations used in conjunction with fabricated messaging and/or forged
documents). PACT assesses with varying degrees of confidence that there are 81
additional, unreported domains clustered with the activity that FireEye and ThreatConnect
detailed in their respective reports [1,2,4]. PACT also assesses with High Confidence that
UNC1151 has targeted additional European entities outside of the Baltics, Poland, Ukraine
and Germany, for which no previous public reporting exists.
Situation Overview:
In July of 2020, FireEye’s Mandiant released a threat intelligence report [1] on an influence
campaign they dubbed “Ghostwriter,” wherein they detailed a cluster of activity that
demonstrated an “anti-NATO agenda” that “primarily targeted audiences in Lithuania, Latvia,
1/10

and Poland with narratives critical of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO)
presence in Eastern Europe.” In April of 2021, ThreatConnect published a Threat Intel
Update [2] that included possible related Ghostwriter infrastructure spoofing military
organizations in Poland and Ukraine, and quotes German investigative reporting [4] detailing
Ghostwriter activity against members of the German government and claiming a possible
connection to the Russian state. Later in April of 2021, Mandiant released an update to their
initial report [3], wherein they attributed at least some of the Ghostwriter activity to UNC1151,
“a suspected state-sponsored cyber espionage actor that engages in credential harvesting
and malware campaigns.” In May of 2021 (the following month), DomainTools released a
report consisting of UNC1151 infrastructure [5] that corroborated previous findings and
included previously unreported infrastructure and network-based IOCs related to UNC1151.
Finally, in August of 2021, VSQUARE released an exhaustive analysis [6] of the Ghostwriter
influence campaign that corroborated previous findings linking Ghostwriter/UNC1151 activity
to the Kremlin and detailing the group’s activity back to 2017 (and possibly earlier), during
which time the group was identified using its phishing infrastructure to send targeted
spearphishing messages and engaging in politically-destructive hack-and-leak operations.
It may assist the reader to detail a brief timeline of notable events of interest that were
reliably reported and attributed [6]:
in 2014, attempts to gain access to the Polish Ministry of National Defence using the
phishing domain `poczta.mon.q0v[.]pl` (later attributed to APT28).
in 2016, similar attempts were made leveraging a phishing domain displaying a similar
pattern: `poczta.mon-gov[.]pl`. The systems of the United States Democratic National
Committee were breached by APT28 (Fancy Bear) and APT29 (Cozy Bear), likely
operating independently. This access led to an infamous hack-and-leak operation to
damage the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton.
in 2017, from March onward, an unidentified group was observed waging a European
disinformation campaign dubbed “Ghostwriter” by FireEye.
in 2018, UNC1151 registers phishing domains, among them `poczta.mon-gov[.]ml`
“with the clear intention of stealing data from the address employees used to log into
their email.” The Lithuanian CERT also publishes a report on an attack later attributed
to Ghostwriter [3].
in 2019, the Lithuanian CERT publishes another [3] report on an attack later attributed
to Ghostwriter.
in 2020 phishing domains were registered and structured in order to
spoof poczta.ron.mil.pl, used by “employees of Poland’s Ministry of National Defence
working remotely.” [6]. Additional phishing infrastructure is registered. Attackers gain
access to the personal email of the chief of the Chancellery of the Prime Minister of
Poland. Various influence operations take place in Poland.

2/10

in 2021, UNC1151 was identified targeting the login credentials of German politicians
[3]. Influence operations continue, but now inauthentic messaging is being spread from
hijacked accounts as well as fake personas. Influence operations take place in
Lithuania [6]. As a result of domestic strife, a well-known Belarusian opposition
blogger’s flight is hijacked while en route to Lithuania and imprisoned. Previously
observed phishing and influence operations continue into the summer.
PACT identified overlapping TTPs throughout this investigation, notably the techniques used
to carry out influence operations (e.g., phishing for credentials to engage in hack-and-leak)
and domain and subdomain naming themes such as `poczta` and other Polish and Ukrainian
words. Previous reports [6] have attributed these overlaps in behavior displayed by distinct
groups (APT28, APT29, and UNC1151) to hypothesize that all this activity is related in some
way to the Russian state generally and its intelligence apparatus specifically; PACT agrees
with this assessment: it is likely that UNC1151’s activity is either controlled or influenced by
Russian intelligence services. PACT is not attributing the activity of APT28 and APT29 to
UNC1151 or vice versa.
Actor Overview:
UNC1151 and the associated Ghostwriter campaign are broad in both scope and target;
previous reporting indicates targeting of audiences within the Baltic nations (Estonia, Latvia,
and Lithuania) as well as Germany, Poland, and Ukraine. Analysis of phishing infrastructure
from these reports indicates the group was targeting official government accounts (both civil
and military) as well as personal accounts. Additional analysis by PACT indicates the
targeting of yet other audiences.
Previous reporting and additional analysis suggest that one of UNC1151’s behaviors is to
use root domains with common, seemingly-legitimate words and themes (e.g., `netaccount[.]online` or `login-telekom[.]online`) and then build upon them with specific, targeted
subdomains to create long URLs that make their phishing domains look legitimate (e.g.,
`gmx.net-account.online` or `verify.login-telekom[.]online`). Additional examples appear
elsewhere in this report and demonstrate UNC1151’s ability to craft convincing domains that
allow them to capture credentials in highly-targeted spearphishing campaigns that can then
be used for follow-on influence operations: hack-and-leak and inauthentic messaging
(sending forged or manipulated messages or posting inflammatory material from hijacked or
fake accounts). This ability, combined with UNC1151’s reported capacity to understand and
exploit pre-existing socio-cultural fissures to sow discord and angst in the targeted states (in
accordance with Moscow’s security goals) can prove damaging and difficult to counteract,
and therefore should be underscored.
PACT identified domain and subdomain naming themes that indicated targeting of the
following audiences: Ukrainian and Polish government (particularly the defense sector)
(image 1,2), European iPhone and iCloud users (image 3), the French Defense Information
and Communication Delegation (DICoD) (a department of the French Ministry of the Armed
3/10

Forces) (image 4), and users of popular regional web service providers across Europe and
Russia (images 5-8), as well as global tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Apple, Twitter, and
Facebook (images 9,10).

media and tech giants.

UNC1151 has proven the effectiveness of these tactics, as hundreds of victims, including
members of the Polish Parliamentary Intelligence Committee and the chief of the
Chancellery of the Prime Minister of Poland, took the bait and gave attackers access to their
private email accounts [6]. Unfortunately, the successful phishing of its targets is only an
initial, enabling feature of UNC1151’s operational methodology. The actor then uses that
access for follow-on influence operations.
Investigative Methodology
4/10

PACT leveraged Prevailion’s unique visibility and proprietary intelligence platform, along with
previous public reporting, to identify patterns and cross-reference web infrastructure (e.g.,
historical domain registration, TLS certificate, DNS, and hosting data) to aid in the
identification of additional UNC1151 infrastructure. PACT identified an additional 83 domains
associated with UNC1151 that have not been previously reported: 52 of which PACT
assesses with High Confidence are or were part of UNC1151’s operational infrastructure,
and 31 that PACT assesses with Moderate Confidence to be previously-used phishing
infrastructure for the actor’s targeted phishing campaigns.
The High Confidence cluster has been cross-referenced with previous public reporting and is
listed at the bottom of this blog; PACT also included the rest of the UNC1151 infrastructure
from previous reporting for defenders’ and researchers’ convenience. This cluster includes
the phishing domains that PACT assesses with high confidence were intended to gain login
credentials for members of the French Defense Ministry’s DICoD. Much of this cluster
appears designed to capture login credentials for official and personal accounts of Polish and
Ukrainian audiences (images 11,12); common subdomain themes are shared throughout
(images 13-16). Activity related to this cluster of domains is ongoing, as evidenced by the
registration of `login-inbox[.]site` on 2021-08-20.

Polish audience.
Image 12: Phishing domain crafted to target personal accounts of a
Ukrainian audience.
Image 13-16: Phishing domains displaying common subdomain
themes.

The Moderate Confidence cluster was identified using observed hosting commonalities,
previous reporting on widespread phishing campaigns [6], and commonalities of domain and
subdomain naming themes [2]. This cluster of activity was active as recently as July 2021,
but most of the domain registrations occurred in 2019 with expirations in 2020. The naming
themes indicate a targeted audience of Apple (iPhone and iCloud) users in Europe; nearly all
root domains have at least one subdomain that includes the words “apple” or “icloud”
5/10

(images 17,18). Additional subdomains appear to target Paypal and OVH Telecom logins as
well (images 19,20). If PACT is correct in attributing this activity to UNC1151, this cluster of
mostly-expired Moderate Confidence activity indicates a change in targeting around
2020/2021, as Ghostwriter was primarily aimed at an audience in Poland, Ukraine, and the
Baltics (as one can easily see with a quick glance at the subdomains in the High Confidence
cluster). This Moderate Confidence cluster, by contrast, appears to have explicitly targeted
European iCloud users.

Conclusion
PACT is unable to verify that UNC1151 is a homogenous group with central direction; PACT
also cannot verify that all Ghostwriter activities were conducted by UNC1151, as PACT
analysts only have visibility into the web-based infrastructure. It is possible that phishing
infrastructure creation, credential gathering, access, and the influence operations were
centrally directed or controlled but carried out by different groups. It is clear, however, that
there is an overarching theme and direction to these activities. It is this theme and direction
that PACT has identified and continues to track under the UNC1151 actor, which
corroborates the reports cited below.
PACT continues to track UNC1151 and the Ghostwriter campaign by leveraging Prevailion’s
unique and unparalleled visibility into malicious infrastructure creation, and will publish
follow-on updates as they are identified and corroborated.
