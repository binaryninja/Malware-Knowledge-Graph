Threat Actors leveraging Telegram to build malware
During our routine threat hunting exercise, Cyble Research Labs came across a TOR website listing a
variety of malware for sale. This includes stealers, clippers, worms, miners, ransomware, and DDoS Bots
which the Threat Actors (TAs) have named ‘Eternity Project.’

Figure 1 – Product Information
Upon further investigation, the TAs also have a Telegram channel with around 500 subscribers, where they
have provided information about the malware’s operation and features through detailed videos. The
Telegram channel also shares information about the malware’s updates, which shows that the TAs are
actively working to enhance the features of the malware.

Interestingly, individuals who purchase the malware can utilize the Telegram Bot to build the binary. The
TAs provide an option in the Telegram channel to customize the binary features, which provides an
effective way to build binaries without any dependencies.

Gaming software: Steam session, Twitch, OBS broadcasting keys.
System credentials: Credman passwords, Vault passwords, Networks passwords).
Figure 4 demonstrates the steps to build Eternity Stealer malware through the Telegram Bot. Initially, the
Telegram channel shows available products to users who purchased the malware when they enter a
command /Product.
Once the users select the stealer product, they are presented with further options for features such as
AntiVM and AntiRepeat. Finally, the user has the option to select the available payload file extension such
as .exe, .scr, .com, and pif. After selecting the file extension, the user can download the stealer payload
from the Telegram channel.

program that uses the resources of an infected computer to mine cryptocurrency.
The features of the miner malware mentioned on the TA’s website and Telegram channel are:
Startup
Small size
Silent Monero mining
Restart when killed
Hidden from the task manager
Figure 6 demonstrates the steps to build Eternity Miner malware through the Telegram Bot. Here, the users
can enter their Monero wallet address and Monero pool URLs while building the binary.

Eternity Clipper
The developer sells the clipper malware for $110. The Eternity Clipper is a malicious program that monitors
the clipboard of an infected machine for cryptocurrency wallets and replaces them with the TA’s cryptowallet addresses.
The features of the Clipper malware mentioned on the TA’s website and Telegram channel are:
Startup
Small size
Hidden from the task manager
Reporting to Telegram Bot
Prevents second reporting of replacement to prevent spam
Support of multiple address formats for BTC, LTC, ZEC, and BCH
Figure 7 demonstrates the steps to build the Eternity Clipper malware through a Telegram Bot. Here, users
can enter their crypto wallet addresses while building the binary.

Eternity Ransomware
The developer sells the Eternity Ransomware for $490. Eternity Ransomware is a malicious program that
prevents users from accessing their machine, either by locking the system’s screen or encrypting the users’
files until a ransom is paid.
The features of the ransomware mentioned on the TA’s website and Telegram channel are:
Encrypts all documents, photos, and databases on disks, local shares, and USB drives.
Offline encryption (Doesn’t requires network connection)
Uses a very strong algorithm of encryption utilizing both AES and RSA.
The ability to set a time limit after which the files cannot be decrypted.
Execution on a specific date
Currently, FUD (0/26)

Figure 8 depicts the steps to build Eternity Ransomware through the TA’s Telegram channel. Here, users
can enter text to be shown once the victims open an encrypted file. The TAs can mention the ransom notes
and payment details etc., for further communication with victims.
Additionally, users have the option to enter the time limit for the ransom payment. If victims fail to pay the
ransom within the time limit, the encrypted files can’t be decrypted. This is set as a default feature while
compiling ransomware binary.

Eternity Worm
The developer sells the Eternity Worm for $390. It is a virus that spreads through infected machines via
files and networks. The features of the worm dropper malware mentioned on the TA’s website and
Telegram channel are:
USB Drives
Local network shares
Local Files (py, zip, exe, bat, jar, pdf, Docx, xlsx, pptx, mp3, mp4, png)
Cloud Drives (GoogleDrive, OneDrive, DropBox)
Python Interpreter (Injects worm loader into all compiled python projects)
Discord Spam (Sends your messages to all channels and friends)
Telegram Spam (Sends your messages to all channels and contacts)
Figure 10 depicts the steps to build Eternity worm malware through the TAs Telegram channel. Here, users
can provide the URL where the worm payload will be located and also provide direct download URLs to
download the worm payload. Eternity Worm can infect local files and spread through Discord and Telegram
channels.

Eternity DDoS Bot
According to the TA’s website, the DDoS Bot malware is currently under development.
We suspect the developer behind the Eternity project is leveraging code from the existing Github repository
and then modifying and selling it under a new name.
Our analysis also indicated that the Jester Stealer could also be rebranded from this particular Github
project which indicates some links between the two Threat Actors.

Conclusion
Cyble Research Labs has observed a significant increase in cybercrime through Telegram channels and
cybercrime forums where TAs sell their products without any regulation. We have encountered the Eternity
products being sold on one such Telegram channel and TOR website.
Cyble will continue to monitor Eternity Project’s products and update our readers with the latest
information.

Our Recommendations
We have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against
attackers. We recommend that our readers follow the best practices given below:

Safety measures needed to prevent malware attacks
Conduct regular backup practices and keep those backups offline or in a separate network.
10/12

Turn on the automatic software update feature on your computer, mobile, and other connected
devices wherever possible and pragmatic.
Use a reputed anti-virus and Internet security software package on your connected devices, including
PC, laptop, and mobile.
Refrain from opening untrusted links and email attachments without verifying their authenticity.
