LuckyMouse, TA428, HyperBro, Tmanger and ShadowPad linked in Mongolian supplychain attack
UPDATE (December 14, 2020): We have no reason to believe that Able Desktop updates
or trojanized installers are still being used to distribute malware. The last instance we saw
occurred in July 2020 as described in our blogpost.
On December 11th, Able Soft stated in an email to us that the trojanized installers and Able
Desktop’s updates have not been used since the incident was reported to them. They also
stated that, as a precaution against further attacks, Able Soft halted the Able Desktop
updates, and that the last occurrence they observed of such attacks was in July 2020.
ESET has no information that allows us to corroborate or dispute these statements.
ESET researchers discovered that chat software called Able Desktop, part of a business
management suite popular in Mongolia and used by 430 government agencies in
Mongolia (according to Able), was used to deliver the HyperBro backdoor (commonly used
by LuckyMouse), the Korplug RAT (also known as PlugX), and
a RAT called Tmanger (which was first documented by NTT Security and was used during
Operation Lagtime IT campaigns attributed to TA428 by Proofpoint). A connection with the
ShadowPad backdoor, which is now used by at least five different threat actors, was also
found.
Two different trojanized installers, as well as a likely compromised update system, were
used to deliver the payloads. According to our telemetry we think the Able update
system has been compromised since at least June 2020 and trojanized installers delivered
since at least May 2018.
Additionally, yesterday, Avast published a blogpost documenting a
campaign targeting government agencies and a national data center in Mongolia.
During that campaign, the attackers compromised an unknown company that was providing
government institutions in East Asia and leveraged that compromise to deliver HyperBro by
email. We believe that compromised company was Able, as the filename used in
that malicious email attachment is probably AbleTimeAccess_Update.exe, and we observed
such a file being used to drop the same HyperBro sample as described in Avast’s blogpost.
A diagram summarizing the connections between LuckyMouse, TA428 and
the ShadowPad backdoor C&C infrastructure is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Summary of the connections between LuckyMouse, TA428 and the ShadowPad backdoor

Regarding the attribution of Operation StealthyTrident, considering that HyperBro is
commonly attributed to LuckyMouse, that Tmanger was attributed to TA428 and that it uses
one of the ShadowPad C&C servers, multiple competing hypotheses exist:
LuckyMouse has access to Tmanger and ShadowPad.
LuckyMouse share its access to the compromised Able Desktop update server with
the TA428 group or some other group having access to Tmanger.
HyperBro is now shared with TA428 or some other group having access to
Tmanger and ShadowPad.
LuckyMouse and TA428 are subgroups of the same threat actor.
Although originally only known to be used by the Winnti Group, it should also be noted here
that since at least October 2019, ShadowPad has been shared amongst multiple threat
actors including the Winnti Group, CactusPete, TICK, IceFog and KeyBoy.
Additional elements regarding the connection between Tmanger and TA428 will be
published in a second blogpost documenting another campaign where the attackers used
both Tmanger and ShadowPad.
We called this campaign Operation StealthyTrident because the attackers make extensive
use of a three-pronged “trident” side-loading technique.

Compromised Able Desktop
Able Desktop is chat software included
as part of the Able business management suite used in Mongolia. It is a Chromiumbased JavaScript app making use of the NodeJS library. According to Able, their software

3/15

suite is used by 430 government agencies in Mongolia.
In mid-2018, we observed a first occurrence of the
legitimate Able Desktop application being used to download and execute HyperBro.
HyperBro is a backdoor commonly attributed to LuckyMouse (also known as Emissary
Panda or APT27). Able Desktop was also used to download and execute Tmanger; in that
case, the Able Desktop software itself was not trojanized (i.e. it did not contain malicious
code). The most likely hypothesis is that the Able Desktop update system was
compromised.
In addition to legitimate Able Desktop applications used to drop and execute HyperBro,
likely using its update system, we also found two Able Desktop installers that
were actually trojanized and contained the HyperBro backdoor and the Korplug RAT. The
first occurrence of this trojanized Able Desktop installer dates back to December 2017. A
timeline of these events is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2. Timeline of the various implants used with either a trojanized Able Desktop installer or
likely delivered through Able Desktop update

We notified Able about these compromises.

Able Desktop update mechanism
To update itself, Able Desktop downloads the update installer through HTTPS. The code
responsible for the update is shown in Figure 3.

4/15

Figure 3. JavaScript code responsible for Able Desktop updates

The downloaded update installer is saved to %USERPROFILE%\Documents\Able\Able
Desktop.exe. Once downloaded, the installer is executed. In the case of a legitimate update
installer, a new version of Able Desktop will be installed. We observed,
however, that starting in mid-2018, the executable downloaded wasn’t a legitimate
installer, but rather the HyperBro backdoor. Since, in that case, the executable is not an
Able Desktop installer but plain malware, no update installation takes place and HyperBro is
executed instead —and Able Desktop is not updated anymore.
Multiple elements support the hypothesis of a compromise of the update server:
The filename and the path used to download HyperBro are the filename and path
used by the update system.
The update is downloaded through HTTPS, so a man–in–the–middle attack is
unlikely.
HyperBro was dropped on all computers using Able Desktop during the same
timeframe as previous legitimate updates.
The malicious Able Desktop.exe is dropped by the real Able Desktop software and
not malware masquerading as Able Desktop.
No legitimate updates have been installed since the beginning of the campaign.
We believe this is enough to state that the update mechanism was compromised. It should
be noted that Able Desktop has multiple update servers, some of them hosted at customer
organizations. Since we have no information on which update server was
used by these victims, we don’t know whether Able was compromised, or one of
their customer’s update servers.

The list of update servers used by Able Desktop is shown in Figure 4. We can see from that
list that Able Desktop is indeed used by several government entities such as the Mineral
Resource Authority of Mongolia, the Ministry of Justice and Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of
Construction and Urban Development, the Development Bank of Mongolia or the Mongolian
State University of Education.

Then, in July 2020, we saw a shift from HyperBro being delivered by the update system to a
backdoor attributed to TA428 and called Tmanger.

Trojanized Able Desktop
6/15

In addition to HyperBro and Tmanger being downloaded by legitimate Able Desktop
software, we also found two different trojanized installers. It is unknown to us whether these
installers were downloadable from the Able website or from another source.
Able Desktop installers, both legitimate and trojanized, are 7-Zip SFX installers and are not
signed. In the case of trojanized installers, the legitimate Able Desktop software is bundled
with either HyperBro or Korplug. The payload and its side–loading host are packaged in
a data1.dat file which is a 7-Zip SFX archive while Able Desktop is packaged
in a data.dat file which is an Advanced Installer. The content of the trojanized installer is
summarized in Figure 5. The same IntgStat.exe side–loading
host and pcalocalresloader.dll are used in both the root of the Able Desktop.exe archive
and data1.dat archive.

7/15

Figure 5. Trojanized Able Desktop installer content

The 7-Zip SFX installer first executes IntgStat.exe, a legitimate Symantec executable, which
is a DLL side–loading host used to load pcalocalresloader.dll. This DLL is used to decrypt
and load the XOR-encoded payload stored in thumb.db. This payload, XOR encoded
with 0x04, once mapped into memory by the payload loader, will decompress and execute
an embedded, LZNT1–compressed PE executable that is used to rename data.dat (the
legitimate installer) and data1.dat (the malicious payload) as Able
Desktop.exe and data1.exe respectively, and then execute them.
8/15

Once executed, the newly renamed data1.exe 7-Zip SFX archive will extract its
contents and execute the second IntgStat.exe side–loading host, which then
loads pcalocalresloader.dll. Again pcalocalresloader.dll is used to load the XORencoded payload stored in the thumb.db file. As before, this payload will decompress and
execute an embedded LZNT1–compressed PE executable, which is actually HyperBro.
Note that, in the case of the Able Desktop installer trojanized with Korplug, the same side–
loading host and DLL are used to execute data1.dat, while the side–loading host used to
execute Korplog itself is not IntgStat.exe, but siteadv.exe – a legitimate
executable from McAfee – and the loader DLL is called siteadv.dll. Apart from this change of
side–loading host, the payload delivery mechanism is the same.

HyperBro
The HyperBro backdoor is LuckyMouse’s custom backdoor used since at least 2013 and in
continuous development. The variant being used here is similar to the variant described
by Palo Alto Networks and Kaspersky. HyperBro was delivered to victims by both the
legitimate Able Desktop software and a trojanized Able Desktop installer.
Similar to the version used with the trojanized Able Desktop installer, in the case of the
HyperBro implant downloaded by the legitimate Able Desktop, its first stage consists in a 7Zip SFX containing:
thinprobe.exe, a legitimate Symantec executable used for DLL side–loading
thinprobe.dll, a HyperBro loader
thumbs.db, the XOR-encoded payload
HyperBro’s loader DLL, thinprobe.dll, is executed by DLL side–loading
using the thinprobe.exe executable, which is a legitimate, signed Symantec
executable. While the side–loading host used with the downloaded HyperBro is different,
the DLL used to decode and execute the thumbs.db payload is exactly the same.
This technique is very similar to the three–pronged trident attack reported by a Kaspersky
researcher. Both thinprobe.exe and Intgstat.exe side–loading hosts were previously used
by LuckyMouse to load HyperBro.
Note, however, that contrary to previously documented HyperBro droppers employing such
a trident, the payload here is not Shikata Ga Nai encoded but XOR encoded with the
value 0x04.
The C&C URL of the HyperBro implant used with the trojanized Able Desktop installer
is https://developer.firefoxapi[.]com/ajax, while the C&C URL used by the one downloaded
by the legitimate Able Desktop is https://139.180.208[.]225/ajax.

9/15

Considering HyperBro’s compilation timestamps, the version used with the trojanized
installer was compiled Fri Dec 08 05:22:23 2017 while the version downloaded by Able
Desktop was compiled Mon Mar 11 03:23:54 2019. This suggests that the trojanized
installer was used before the version downloaded by the Able Desktop updater. The
trojanized installer was first seen in our telemetry in May 2018, while the version
downloaded by Able Desktop was first seen in June 2020 (see the timeline in Figure 2).

Korplug
The Korplug RAT (also known as PlugX) is used by multiple different threat groups. In
this case, it was only delivered via the trojanized Able Desktop installer and we have seen
no occurrence of Korplug being downloaded by legitimate Able Desktop software.
As mentioned previously, and similar to installers trojanized
with HyperBro, Korplug is bundled in the installer with the legitimate Able Desktop and
executed twice via the trident model by DLL side–loading using IntgStat.exe as host
executable and then siteadv.exe. The identical DLL is used to decode and execute
the thumbs.db XOR-encoded payload as the one used with the installer trojanized
with HyperBro, providing a strong link between these two trojanized installers.
The C&C address used by Korplug is 45.77.173[.]124:443. Interestingly, this address was
also used by a CobaltStrike implant targeting a school in Mongolia during the same
timeframe.
Its compilation timestamp (Sun Dec 08 06:22:34 2019) as well as the compilation
timestamp of the installer (Wed Sep 04 16:52:04 2019) suggest that it was used after the
Able Desktop installer trojanized with HyperBro and before HyperBro was downloaded by
legitimate Able Desktop software. See the timeline in Figure 2.

Tmanger
Tmanger is a RAT that was first documented by NTT Security and
that was used in Operation Lagtime IT which was attributed to TA428 by Proofpoint. It is
called Tmanger because it is apparently the name given by its developer, as we can see
from its PDB path, as an example:
c:\users\waston\desktop\20190403_tmanger\20191118 tm_new 1.0\release\mloaddll.pdb
Considering the variant we observed during Operation StealthyTrident no PDB path was
present but it is still very similar to the one documented by NTT Security in
their blogpost. As an example of similarity between the two samples, the connection
procedure used by one of the Tmanger samples documented by
NTT Security (14140782A68FF20000C7E9F58336620A65D4D168) and the one dropped
by Able Desktop are shown side-by-side in Figure 6.
10/15

Figure 6. Comparison of the connection routine in Tmanger sample dropped by legitimate Able Desktop
(left) and one of the samples documented by NTT SecurityOne notable difference is that in the case of
the Able Desktop variant, Tmanger is packaged is one single executable, while the variant described by
NTT Security consists of three DLLs.

ESET telemetry shows the first download of this Tmanger variant by the legitimate Able
Desktop software in July 2020. Tmanger replaced HyperBro on that system and HyperBro
was not seen downloaded to it after that.
The C&C addresses used by this Tmanger implant, downloaded by Able Desktop, are
stored in an RC4-encrypted configuration and are the following:
45.77.55[.]145:80
45.77.55[.]145:443
45.77.55[.]145:8080
The communication protocol is TCP and the messages are RC4 encrypted.

11/15

Interestingly, the first address is part of the ShadowPad network infrastructure and, to the
best of our knowledge, none of these addresses are overlapping with LuckyMouse
infrastructure.

Conclusion
ESET Research discovered a campaign targeting Mongolian
organizations that relied on compromised Able Desktop installers and compromises to the
Able update system to deliver HyperBro, Korplug and Tmanger malware.
This campaign shows a connection with the ShadowPad backdoor, as we observed network
infrastructure overlaps between the ShadowPad C&C network infrastructure and one of the
Tmanger C&C addresses.
Apart from the use of HyperBro, developed and commonly used by LuckyMouse, we found
no significant overlap with the LuckyMouse toolset or network
infrastructure. Does this mean that LuckyMouse has access to ShadowPad and Tmanger or
did LuckyMouse share their access to a compromised Able Desktop update
server with the TA428 group? Another hypothesis could be that, similarly to
ShadowPad, HyperBro is now shared with other threat actors. Finally, one last hypothesis
could be that LuckyMouse and TA428 are closely related threat actors or are actually
the same.
Indicators of Compromise can also be found on GitHub. For any inquiries, or to make
sample submissions related to the subject, contact us at: threatintel@eset.com.
