As we’ve previously written, adversaries continue to ramp up DNS-based attacks to support
a wide range of criminal activities. As part of our mission to leverage our network visibility to
both help protect customers and keep the internet clean, Black Lotus Labs monitors global
DNS traffic for anomalous behavior that may be malicious. One of our machine learning
models recently flagged unusual queries to the domain akamai-technologies[.]com1, and

1/7

upon decoding the information contained in the subdomains of these queries, uncovered
what was revealed to be credit card information being exfiltrated by the Alina Point of Sale
(POS) malware.
Credit card processing systems typically run in Windows environments, allowing them to be
targeted by the existing skills of the crimeware markets. Due to the strict security restrictions
applied to credit card processing, HTTP and other common outbound traffic may be highly
restricted in these environments. However, DNS is often left available, and too commonly
goes unmonitored. This makes DNS an attractive choice for outbound communication in
POS malware, including the exfiltrating of stolen credit card information. Malware authors
encode the stolen information and issue a DNS query to the actor-controlled domain name.
The encoded data is placed in a subdomain, which the malicious actors then extract when
they receive the DNS query.

The malicious actors then sell this information in underground criminal markets. The number
of credit card numbers for sale in underground forums tripled in the second half of 2019
compared to the first six months of the year, making POS malware an opportunity to
participate in an unfortunately thriving criminal market2.

Alina Malware Deep Dive
After identifying the akamai-technologies[.]com domain, we found three other domains with
similar DNS queries. Further research showed these domains as being used by the Alina
POS malware3.

akamai-analytics[.]com
akamai-information[.]com
akamai-technologies[.]com
The POS devices that complete credit card transactions can vary greatly. They may be
separate hardware devices, but in smaller retail environments it may be a regular desktop
computer running the POS software. During the credit card transaction, the data is typically
decrypted and is temporarily in the POS software’s memory in unencrypted form. The
malware searches the RAM of the POS device for this unencrypted credit card information
and sends it back to a Command and Control (C2) server. To ensure that only real credit
card data is found when searching the RAM of the device, the malware verifies that the last
digit of the card number is the correct check digit4 using the Luhn checksum algorithm5.

Since it was first discovered in 2012, the malware authors behind Alina have evolved their
Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) to evade detection. While earlier samples of the
malware used HTTPS or a combination of HTTPS and DNS for the exfiltration of the stolen
credit card information, samples seen starting in late 2018 use DNS exclusively for
communication3.
Below are the volume of queries Black Lotus Labs observed to each of the C2 domains since
January 2020. We can see that after a decrease in traffic in April, there has been an increase
in traffic to all the domains, especially akamai-technologies[.]com, since the beginning of
May. This increase in traffic is due to queries originating from a single victim from the
financial services industry.

DNS queries to the C2 domains are all type A queries, meaning they are expecting an ipv4
response. They all have random-looking subdomains, such as the following query:
yeTLxcbvkOjr6eH_-pCYkPrDxM0.akamai-technologies[.]com
Black Lotus Labs was able to decode the encoded subdomains. First, characters that are not
allowed in DNS queries according to the DNS protocol specification must be replaced by
their original characters:
“-” is replaced with “/”
“_” is replaced with “+”
Then the resulting subdomain can be base64 decoded, by adding trailing “=” characters if
necessary. Finally, this decoded data is XORed with the byte 0xAA. This XOR value was
used in previous versions of the malware that utilized HTTP POST messages for

communication6. Using this algorithm, we can see the exfiltrated data from the decoded
subdomains.
cNaolE:BACKTT:2:Ping
YaKNsY:BACKOFFICEz2::ddcdsrv1.exe::<Credit card digits removed>
The first six characters of the decoded queries appear to be an ID value consisting of upperand lower-case letters that is unique to each victim. Every communication from the victim
starts with this unique ID. This is similar to the random characters chosen by the malware as
a unique identifier in previous versions6.
The character “:” is used as a delimiter in the decoded data. Following the ID field is a
descriptor or location field, such as “BACKTT” or “BACKOFFICEz2” in the above data. We
have also observed values such as “TERMINAL1.” It is unclear what this represents, but
given the names observed this may be the system name of the computers infected with the
malware.
Each of the DNS queries uncovered are either checking in with the C2, such as the “Ping”
query above, or they contain credit card information. The queries that contain credit card
numbers contain an executable name in the field following the location or descriptor field.
This appears to be the process which the malware identified as containing the credit card
information in memory. Earlier samples of the malware either contained a list of processes to
examine, or examined every process running except for those contained in a list of
processes to ignore7.
Some of the processes found in the decoded data, which are shown below, were seen in the
list of processes to examine in previous versions of the malware7.
CreditCardService.exe
DSIMercuryIP_Dial.exe
EdcSvr.exe
fpos.exe
Below are other processes we observed in the decoded data. Some of these, such as
“ddcdsrv1.exe,” have been targeted by other POS malware8.
Brain.exe
Focus.exe
appidt.exe
ddcdsrv1.exe
4/7

fontdvrhost.exe
tcopy.exe
The final field in the decoded data begins with the credit card number, followed by “=” and
the expiration date, in the following format. The final seven digits are unclear.
<Credit card digits removed>=DDMMYYYY<Unknown seven digits>
For most of the queries, the response given in DNS by the actor’s authoritative name server
is 127.0.0.1. Examining the IPs hosting the name servers for the C2 domains, we came
across another suspicious domain, sync-akamai[.]com. The name server for this domain was
hosted on the same IP as ns1.akamai-analytics[.]com. While we have not seen any data
exfiltration to this domain yet, it should be monitored as well.
DNS is a popular choice for malware authors to bypass security controls and exfiltrate data
from protected networks. Point of Sale malware continues to pose a serious security threat,
and malicious actors regularly update their malware in efforts to evade detection. At Black
Lotus Labs, we use machine learning algorithms to identify data exfiltration and other
anomalous DNS traffic. We have reached out to our customers impacted by the Alina
malware and the registrars of the malicious domains, and will continue to monitor the
malicious domains as we work to eliminate the exfiltration of data in the CenturyLink global
DNS traffic. We recommend all organizations, including retailers using point of sale systems,
to monitor DNS traffic for suspicious queries.

managed by Akamai. As of the date of this publication, Akamai was actively collaborating
with Black Lotus Labs to take down the imposter domains.
