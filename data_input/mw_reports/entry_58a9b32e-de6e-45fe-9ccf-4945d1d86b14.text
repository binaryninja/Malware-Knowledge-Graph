APT42: Crooked Charms, Cons, and Compromises
mandiant.com/resources/blog/apt42-charms-cons-compromises

Today, Mandiant is releasing a comprehensive report detailing APT42, an Iranian statesponsored cyber espionage group tasked with conducting information collection and
surveillance operations against individuals and organizations of strategic interest to the
Iranian government. We estimate with moderate confidence that APT42 operates on behalf
of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)’s Intelligence Organization (IRGC-IO)
based on targeting patterns that align with the organization’s operational mandates and
priorities.
The full published report covers APT42’s recent and historical activity dating back to at least
2015, the group’s tactics, techniques, and procedures, targeting patterns, and elucidates
historical connections to APT35. APT42 partially coincides with public reporting on TA453
(Proofpoint), Yellow Garuda (PwC), ITG18 (IBM X-Force), Phosphorus (Microsoft), and
Charming Kitten (ClearSky and CERTFA).

APT42.

APT42 Operations
APT42 uses highly targeted spear-phishing and social engineering techniques designed to
build trust and rapport with their victims in order to access their personal or corporate email
accounts or to install Android malware on their mobile devices. In addition, APT42
infrequently uses Windows malware to complement their credential harvesting and
surveillance efforts.
APT42 operations broadly fall into three categories:
Credential harvesting: APT42 frequently targets corporate and personal email
accounts through highly targeted spear-phishing campaigns with enhanced emphasis
on building trust and rapport with the target before attempting to steal their credentials.
Mandiant also has indications that the group leverages credential harvesting to collect
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) codes to bypass authentication methods and has
used compromised credentials to pursue access to the networks, devices, and
accounts of employers, colleagues, and relatives of the initial victim.

Surveillance operations: As of at least late 2015, a subset of APT42’s infrastructure
served as command-and-control (C2) servers for Android mobile malware designed to
track locations, monitor communications, and generally surveil the activities of
individuals of interest to the Iranian government, including activists and dissidents
inside Iran.
Malware deployment: While APT42 primarily prefers credential harvesting over
activity on disk, several custom backdoors and lightweight tools complement its
arsenal. The group likely incorporates these tools into their operations when the
objectives extend beyond credential harvesting.
Mandiant has observed over 30 confirmed targeted APT42 operations spanning these
categories since early 2015. The total number of APT42 intrusion operations is almost
certainly much higher based on the group’s high operational tempo, visibility gaps caused in
part by the group’s targeting of personal email accounts and domestically focused efforts,
and extensive open-source industry reporting on threat clusters likely associated with
APT42.

APT42 Targeting Patterns
The targeting patterns for APT42 operations are similar to other Iranian cyber espionage
actors, with a large segment of its activity focused on the Middle East region. However,
unlike other suspected IRGC-affiliated cyber espionage groups that have focused on
targeting the defense industrial base or conducting large-scale collection of personally
identifiable information (PII), APT42 primarily targets organizations and individuals deemed
opponents or enemies of the regime, specifically gaining access to their personal accounts

and mobile devices. The group has consistently targeted Western think tanks, researchers,
journalists, current Western government officials, former Iranian government officials, and the
Iranian diaspora abroad.
Some APT42 activity indicates the group alters its operational focus as Iran’s priorities
evolve, to include targeted operations against the pharmaceutical sector at the onset of the
COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 and pursuing domestic and foreign-based opposition
groups prior to an Iranian presidential election. This indicates that APT42 is trusted by the
Iranian government to quickly react to geopolitical changes by adjusting their flexible
operations to targets of operational interest to Tehran.

Potential Ties Between APT42 and Ransomware Activity
Mandiant further highlights open-source reporting from Microsoft claiming a connection
between intrusion activity clusters that generally align with APT42 and UNC2448, an Irannexus threat actor known for widespread scanning for various vulnerabilities, the use of the
Fast Reverse Proxy tool, and reported ransomware activity using BitLocker. Notably,
Mandiant has not observed technical overlaps between APT42 and UNC2448.

In November 2021, Microsoft reported that “Phosphorus” had targeted Fortinet FortiOS
SSL VPN and unpatched on-premises Exchange servers globally with the intent of
deploying ransomware such as BitLocker on vulnerable networks, aligning with activity
we track as UNC2448. Previous reporting on Phosphorus generally aligned with
APT42’s credential harvesting and spear-phishing operations.
While Mandiant has not observed technical overlaps between APT42 and UNC2448, the
latter may also have ties to the IRGC-IO. We assess with moderate confidence that
UNC2448 and the Revengers Telegram persona are operated by at least two Iranian front
companies, Najee Technology and Afkar System, based on open-source information and
operational security lapses by the threat actors. Public leaking campaigns from the Lab
Dookhtegan Telegram account further allege these companies are responsible for threat
activity aligned with UNC2448 and operate on behalf of the IRGC-IO.
Mandiant identified links between UNC2448, the Revengers persona, an individual
named Ahmad Khatibi, and a likely Iranian front company named Afkar System.
The Revengers persona had offered data and access to primarily Israeli companies for
sale on its Telegram channel between February and September 2021.
Additionally, infrastructure overlaps likely caused by human error indicate that
UNC2448 has connections to a second front company, Najee Technology.
Public posts by the Lab Dookhtegan Telegram channel in July 2022 claim Afkar System
and Najee Technology are front companies conducting cyber operations on behalf of
the IRGC’s Intelligence Organization.

Looking Ahead
APT42 activity poses a threat to foreign policy officials, commentators, and journalists,
particularly those in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Israel, working on Iranrelated projects. Additionally, the group’s surveillance activity highlights the real-world risk to
individual targets of APT42 operations, which include Iranian dual-nationals, former
government officials, and dissidents both inside Iran and those who previously left the
country, often out of fear for their personal safety.
We do not anticipate significant changes to APT42’s operational tactics and mandate given
the long history of activity and imperviousness to infrastructure take downs and a media
spotlight on operational security failures. Nevertheless, the group has displayed its ability to
rapidly alter its operational focus as Iran’s priorities change over time with evolving domestic
and geopolitical conditions. We assess with high confidence that APT42 will continue to
perform cyber espionage and surveillance operations aligned with evolving Iranian
operational intelligence collection requirements.
