Notes on Linux/BillGates
bartblaze.blogspot.com/2017/12/notes-on-linuxbillgates.html

In a previous blog post, I wrote some (extensive) notes on Linux/Xor.DDoS, also known as
just Xor.DDoS, an interesting type of Linux malware.
You can find that particular blog below, in which I give some history, details, remediation and
prevention in regards to the specific threat Xor.DDoS poses:
Notes on Linux/Xor.DDoS
This post will include some notes on Linux/BillGates, hereafter referred to as just 'BillGates',
and rather than being very in-depth as the previous blog, I will mostly list high-level notes
and remediation or disinfection steps. Additionally, after the conclusion, you will find other
resources if necessary. In case of questions, comments or feedback, leave a comment or
contact me on Twitter.
What is BillGates?
BillGates is malware designed primarily for Linux, and since it is a botnet, it is mostly used
for DDoS purposes.
However, just as Xor.DDoS, it has limited rootkit and backdoor functionality and thus it's
possible remote commands are executed as well as additional malware downloaded.
How can I identify BillGates artefacts?
Please find below a table with indicators.

Indicator

Notes

/etc/cmd.n
/etc/conf.n
/etc/init.d/DbSecuritySpt
/etc/init.d/selinux
/etc/rcX.d/97DbSecuritySpt

Where X is a number, usually symlinks to
/etc/init.d/DbSecuritySpt

/home/ll2

Identify all files with random names in /home/

/tmp/.bash_root.tmp3
1/4

/tmp/.bash_root.tmp3h
/tmp/bill.lock

Identify all .lock files in /tmp/

/tmp/bill.lod

Contains Process ID (PID) of malware main module

/tmp/gates.lod
(or gates.lock)

Contains PID of malware main module

/tmp/moni.lod
(or moni.lock)

Contains PID of malware 'watchdog'

/tmp/notify.file
/usr/bin/*.lock

Identify all .lock files in /tmp/

/usr/bin/bsd-port/.sshd
/usr/bin/bsd-port/*.lock
/usr/bin/bsd-port/getty
/usr/bin/bsdport/getty/*.lock

Identify all .lock files in /usr/bin/bsd-port/getty/

/usr/bin/pojie

Identify all files with random names in /usr/bin/

/usr/lib/libamplify.so

Configuration file

How can I identify BillGates DDoS modules?
These modules are usually stored in /etc/, and will have the following names:
atddd
cupsdd
cupsddh
ksapdd
kysapdd
sksapdd
skysapdd

It may however be useful to use the find command in conjunction with these names, in case
they are residing in a different location than /etc/.
How can I identify other modifications BillGates made?
BillGates does create aliases and/or modifies/replaces files which are typically used to
monitor processes or the network. The following may be replaced:
2/4

/bin/lsof
/bin/netstat
/bin/ps
/bin/ss
/usr/bin/lsof
/usr/bin/netstat
/usr/bin/ps
/usr/bin/ss
/usr/sbin/lsof
/usr/sbin/netstat
/usr/sbin/ps
/usr/sbin/ss

A copy of the legitimate files is normally stored in:
/usr/bin/dpkgd/
Additionally, check for any potentially created jobs by looking in:
/etc/cron.X where X is a name or folder, for example /etc/cron.daily.
You may also wish to look in:
/var/spool/cron/
Removal instructions
While the ps command may be replaced, top is not. Run the top command and verify any
illegitimate processes, usually they will be randomly named. Alternatively, identify the *.lod
and *.lock files, and use cat for example to read them, and identify the PID of the malware.
Then, use kill to end the malicious process(es), and remove the files or artefacts as
indicated in the table above.
Afterwards, use mv to move the legitimate files back to their original location. You can also
use a file manager to easily move them, if you have one.
You may also use an anti-virus to identify and remove any malicious files, for example
ClamAV does a great job - BillGates is a rather older botnet by now and thus most
antiviruses should have coverage for it. Don't forget to update the anti-virus' signatures first,
if needed.
This same explanation but step-by-step to make it easy:
Identify malicious processes: use top or check the PID in BillGates' config files;
Killmalicious processes: use kill -9 to kill any of its processes;
Remove malicious files and folders, see the sections above;
3/4

Replace potentially hijacked files and restore them to their original location, see also
above:
Identify any malicious tasks and delete them as indicated above;
Run top again to verify there are no malicious processes left;
Run an anti-virus or anti-malware as a secondary opinion;
Change your passwords, better be safe than sorry!

Conclusion
While Linux/BillGates may not be the biggest player on the market anymore, or even not as
popular or common nowadays, the threat still exists, just like Xor.DDoS.
Practice proper security hygiene and take appropriate preventative measures.
