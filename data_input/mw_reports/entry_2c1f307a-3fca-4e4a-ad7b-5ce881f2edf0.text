Maksim Viktorovich Yakubets (Russian: Маҝсим Виҝторович Яҝубец) is a Russian[1]
computer expert and alleged computer hacker. He is alleged to have been a member of the
Evil Corp, Jabber Zeus Crew, as well as the alleged leader of the Bugat malware conspiracy.
[2][3][4] Russian media openly describe Yakubets as a "hacker who stole $100 million", friend
of Dmitry Peskov and discussed his lavish lifestyle, including luxury wedding with a daughter
of FSB officer Eduard Bendersky and Lamborghini with "ВОР" (Russian for "thief")
registration plate.[5][6][7] Yakubets impunity in Russia is perceived as clue of his close ties with
FSB, but also criticized by domestic information security experts such as Ilya Sachkov.[8]

Indictments
On November 13, 2019, Yakubets was charged in the United States District Court for the
Western District of Pennsylvania for allegedly conspiring in the development, maintenance,
distribution, and infection of Bugat malware. The following day, he was charged in the United
States District Court for the District of Nebraska for his alleged involvement in the installation
of Zeus.[9]

Specifically, Yakubets was involved in the installation of malicious software known as
Zeus, which was disseminated through phishing emails and used to capture victims’
online banking credentials. These credentials were then used to steal money from the
victims’ bank accounts. On August 22, 2012, an individual was charged in a
superseding indictment under the moniker “aqua” in the District of Nebraska with
conspiracy to participate in racketeering activity, conspiracy to commit computer fraud
and identity theft, aggravated identity theft, and multiple counts of bank fraud. On
November 14, 2019, a criminal complaint was issued in the District of Nebraska that
ties the previously indicted moniker of “aqua” to Yakubets and charges him with
conspiracy to commit bank fraud. Yakubets is also allegedly the leader of the
Bugat/Cridex/Dridex malware conspiracy wherein he oversaw and managed the
development, maintenance, distribution, and infection of the malware. Yakubets
allegedly conspired to disseminate the malware through phishing emails, to use the
malware to capture online banking credentials, and to use these captured credentials
to steal money from the victims’ bank accounts. He, subsequently, used the malware to
install ransomware on victims’ computers. Yakubets was indicted in the Western
District of Pennsylvania, on November 13, 2019, and was charged with Conspiracy,
Conspiracy to Commit Fraud, Wire Fraud, Bank Fraud, and Intentional Damage to a
Computer.
