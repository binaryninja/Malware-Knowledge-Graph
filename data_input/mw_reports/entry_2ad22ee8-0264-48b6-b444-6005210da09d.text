Introduction
In June of 2022 Qualys Threat Research Unit (TRU) wrote an in-depth report on Redline, a
commercial off the shelf infostealer that spreads via fake cracked software hosted on
Discord’s content delivery network. Since then, we have continued to track similar threats to
identify their evolving capabilities. In this blog, we will highlight our findings on another
commercial off the shelf malware – BitRAT.
BitRAT is a fairly recent, notorious remote access trojan (RAT) marketed on underground
cybercriminal web markets and forums since Feb 2021. The RAT is particularly well known
for its social media presence and functionality such as:
1. Data exfiltration
2. Execution of payloads with bypasses.
3. DDoS
4. Keylogging
5. Webcam and microphone recording
6. Credential theft
7. Monero mining
8. Running tasks for process, file, software, etc.
These features along with its relatively low cost of 20$ make BitRAT a pervasive threat.

Breach details
While investigating multiple lures for BitRAT we identified that, an adversary had hijacked a
Columbian cooperative bank’s infrastructure. Moreover, the lures themselves contain
sensitive data from the bank to make them appear legitimate. This means that the attacker
has gotten access to customers’ data. While digging deeper into the infrastructure we
identified logs that point to the usage of the tool sqlmap to find potential SQLi faults, along
with actual database dumps. Overall, 4,18,777 rows of sensitive data have been leaked of
customers with details such as Cedula numbers (Columbian national ID), email addresses,
phone numbers, customer names, payment records, salary, address etc. As of today, we
have not found this information shared on any of our darkweb/clearweb monitored lists.
We are following standard breach disclosure guidelines with the identified victims and will
update this article with additional data as things progress.

The data from the tables was reused in Excel maldocs as well as part of the database
dump.

Fig.1 Excel Maldocs
These Excel sheets act as lures for BitRAT. All of them are authored by “Administrator”.

Sample Analysis
The excel contains a highly obfuscated macro that will drop an inf payload and execute it.
The .inf payload is segmented into hundreds of arrays in the macro. The de-obfuscation
routine performs arithmetic operations on these arrays to rebuild the payload. The macro
then writes the payload to temp and executes it via advpack.dll.

Fig.2 Macro content
The .inf file contains a hex encoded second stage dll payload which is decoded via certutil,
written to %temp%\ and executed by rundll32. The temp files are then deleted.

Fig.3 inf payload
This dll uses various anti-debugging techniques to download and execute the final BitRAT
payload. It uses the WinHTTP library to download BitRAT embedded payloads from GitHub
to the %temp% directory.

Fig.4 Writing BitRAT from GitHub.
The dll then uses WinExec to start the %temp% payload and exits. The GitHub repository
was created in mid-November and the account is a throwaway created just to host multiple
payloads.

Fig.6 Adversary GitHub repository
Each of these files are BitRAT loader samples obfuscated via DeepSea. The BitRAT sample
is embedded into the loaders and is obfuscated via SmartAssembly. The loader decodes the
binary and reflectively loads them.

They also contain hijacked resources from two different companies to appear legitimate.

Fig.8 Hijacked resources
The BitRAT sample starts and relocates the loader to user’s startup for persistence. It has
the following configuration:
"Host": "<C2 IP>",
"Port": "7722",
"Tor Port": "0",
"Install Dir": "0",
"Install File": "0",
"Communication Password": "c4ca4238a0b923820dcc509a6f75849b",
"Tor Process Name": "tor"

Conclusion

5/6

Commercial off the shelf. RATs have been evolving their methodology to spread and infect
their victims. They have also increased the usage of legitimate infrastructures to host their
payloads and defenders need to account for it. We at Qualys Threat Research Unit will
continue to monitor and document such threats to understand their evolving TTPs.

Qualys solutions
Qualys provides a whole suite of solutions to help protect your environment against
advanced threats like BitRAT.
Qualys Multi-Vector Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) is a dynamic detection and
response service powered by the Qualys Cloud Platform. Qualys Multi-Vector EDR detects
malware like BitRAT by unifying multiple context vectors to spot its insertion into a network
endpoint. Qualys Cloud Platform provides asset management, vulnerability detection, policy
compliance, patch management, and file integrity monitoring capabilities – all delivered with
a single agent and cloud-based delivery for a lower total cost of ownership.
Qualys External Attack Surface Management (EASM) enables organizations to continuously
monitor and reduce the entire enterprise attack surface including internal and internet-facing
assets and discover previously unidentified exposures. It also helps synchronize with
CMDBs, detect security gaps like unauthorized or end-of-support software, open ports,
remotely exploitable vulnerabilities, digital certificate issues, unsanctioned apps and
domains, and mitigate risk by taking appropriate actions.
