Key Takeaways
The prominent TA505 has returned to distributing large volumes of malicious
emails affecting most industries.
New tools include a KiXtart Loader, the MirrorBlast loader, an updated
FlawedGrace variant, and updated malicious Excel attachments.
One of the region-specific campaigns targeted German-speaking countries, notably
Germany and Austria.
The campaigns share many similarities with TA505 campaigns from 2019 and
2020.

Overview
Since early September 2021, Proofpoint researchers are tracking renewed malware
campaigns by the financially driven TA505. The campaigns, which are distributed across
a wide range of industries, started with low volume email waves that ramped up in late
September, resulting in tens to hundreds of thousands of emails.
Many of the campaigns, especially the large volume ones, strongly resemble the historic
TA505 activity from 2019 and 2020. The commonalities include similar domain naming
conventions, email lures, Excel file lures, and the delivery of the FlawedGrace remote

access trojan (RAT). The campaigns also contain some noteworthy, new developments,
such as retooled intermediate loader stages scripted in Rebol and KiXtart, which are used
instead of the previously popular Get2 downloader. The new downloaders perform
similar functionality of reconnaissance and pulling in the next stages. Lastly, there is an
updated version of FlawedGrace.

Evolving Campaigns
The initial campaigns observed by Proofpoint in September 2021 were comparatively
small in volume, several thousand emails per wave, and delivered malicious Excel
attachments. In late September and in early October 2021 this changed, and TA505 began
sending higher email volumes, tens to hundreds of thousands, to more industries.
Additionally, the actor began leveraging both URL and attachment-based email
campaigns and diversified from targeting predominantly North America to also targeting
German-speaking countries, including Germany and Austria.

September 2021 Campaigns
The early campaigns identified by Proofpoint in September 2021 were low volume
compared to typical TA505 activity, with only several thousand messages per wave.
TA505 used more specific lures that did not affect as many industries as the more recent
October 2021 campaigns. Example lures included legal, media release, situation report,
and health claim themes. These early campaigns also largely focused on targets in North
America, such as United States and Canada.
The emails contained an Excel attachment that, when opened and macros enabled, would
lead to the download and running of an MSI file. The MSI file in turn would execute an
embedded Rebol loader, dubbed by Proofpoint as MirrorBlast.

In late September and throughout October 2021, Proofpoint observed a shift to familiar
TA505 tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that are reminiscent of the actor’s 2019
and 2020 campaigns. An additional intermediary loader scripted in KiXtart was
introduced, and the attack chain evolved to the following:
An email containing one of the below:
Excel attachment
HTML attachment that links to the download of an Excel file
URL linking to a landing page that redirects to the download of an Excel file
URL directly linking to an Excel file
The Excel file macros download and run an MSI file
The MSI file executes an embedded KiXtart loader
The KiXtart loader receives a command from the C&C server to download another
MSI file that executes MirrorBlast
MirrorBlast then downloads additional Rebol script stagers
The follow-on Rebol stagers drop ReflectiveGnome
ReflectiveGnome in turn downloads more shellcode, that will then drop and
detonate FlawedGrace
The email lures moved away from the detailed lures seen initially in this spate of
campaigns. They became more generic, with subjects such as “SECUREFILE,” “SECURE
DOCUMENT,” and “You’ve been sent a secure message.” Additionally, the themes and
abused brands included COVID-19, DocuSign, insurance, invoices, and Microsoft.

There is much similarity between the new and historic TA505 campaigns, starting with
the emails.

Figure 6. The OneDrive shared file email lure used in August 21, 2020 (left) strongly
resembles a similar email from October 7, 2021 (right). Note the additional use of a
COVID-19 theme in the recent campaign.
The landing pages in historic and current TA505 campaigns contain “IP Logger” links
that likely enable TA505 to track the IP addresses of the machines downloading the
malicious files. Additionally, TA505 is still mimicking file hosting services in the landing
pages.

while the landing page used in the October 7, 2021 campaign is shown on the right.
While the Excel macros VBA code in the recent TA505 campaigns is different, some of the
Excel graphic lures are similar or identical to those previously used by TA505.

Figure 8. The Excel sheet lure spoofing Microsoft logos remained identical from
September 2, 2020 (Left) to October 6, 2021 (Right).
Domain naming conventions: It is also notable that TA505 has historically used
domains that mimic various file hosting service providers and structured them in formats
with hyphen separated terms. The domains used in late September 2021 and onward
follow this structure.
Code reuse: Proofpoint researchers found code reuse in parts of the delivery chain such
as in multiple parts of the landing page (see an example mentioned here).

Excel Macros Analysis
For TA505’s 2021 campaigns to be successful, potential victims must enable macros after
opening the malicious Excel files. The code responsible for downloading the next stage
MSI file was typically lightly obfuscated with filler characters, string reversing or similar
simple functions and hidden in the document Comments, Title, in a Cell or other
locations.

TA505 now uses multiple intermediate loaders before the delivery of the FlawedGrace
RAT. The new loader stages are coded in uncommon scripting languages—Rebol and
KiXtart. They appear to serve the same purpose as Get2—a downloader that has been in
use by TA505 since 2019 to deliver a variety of secondary payloads. The loaders perform
minimal reconnaissance of an infected machine, such as collecting user domain and
username information, and download further payloads.

Figure 12. Attack paths ultimately leading to FlawedGrace.
In the attack chain, the Excel macros download the first MSI file, which executes the first
loader, encoded in KiXtart scripting language. The KiXtart interpreter then receives a
command from the C&C server to download a follow-on MSI package. Of note, KiXtart
loader is not always part of the attack chain. The second MSI package contains multiple
files that may have different names, for example, AudioDriver.exe (the Rebol interpreter),
AudioDriver.exe.lnk (command that informs .ico execution), and image.ico (the Rebol
script). This Rebol script is the second new downloader in the chain, that Proofpoint
dubbed MirrorBlast.

Figure 13. Example of MirrorBlast script, it may be slightly different in different
campaigns.
MirrorBlast in turn downloads additional Rebol script stagers that execute simple
downloaders, dubbed by Proofpoint as ReflectiveGnome. ReflectiveGnome in turn
downloads more shellcode, that will then drop and detonate FlawedGrace.

Updated FlawedGrace RAT
Proofpoint researchers first observed FlawedGrace in November 2017. It is a full-featured
RAT written in C++ that can receive the following commands from its C&C via a custom
binary protocol on TCP port 443:
target_remove
target_update
target_reboot
target_module_load
target_module_load_external
target_module_unload
target_download
target_upload
target_rdp
target_passwords
target_servers
target_script
destroy_os

While Proofpoint researchers are still investigating the updates to this version of
FlawedGrace, some notable changes include:
Encrypted strings
Obfuscated API calls
Configuration is now stored as an encrypted resource (initial/default config), then it
is stored both in a mapped memory region (current configuration instance) and in
the registry (persistence)

Attribution
Proofpoint attributes the campaigns discussed in this blog to TA505 with high confidence.
Proofpoint's assessment that TA505 is responsible for this renewed activity is based on
the aforementioned similarities between historic TA505 campaigns and this new activity,
including, but not limited to, code similarities, domain naming patterns and the use of
FlawedGrace, which has been almost exclusively linked to TA505 activity.

Outlook
TA505 is an established threat actor that is financially motivated and known for
conducting malicious email campaigns on a previously unprecedented scale. The group
regularly changes their TTPs and are considered trendsetters in the world of cybercrime.
This threat actor does not limit its target set, and is, in fact, an equal opportunist with the
geographies and verticals it chooses to attack. This combined with TA505’s ability to be
flexible, focusing on what is the most lucrative and shifting its TTPs as necessary, make
the actor a continued threat.
Proofpoint researchers expect TA505 to continue to adjust its operations and methods
always with an eye to financial gain. Using intermediate loaders in its attack chain is also
likely to become a longer-term technique employed by the threat actor.
