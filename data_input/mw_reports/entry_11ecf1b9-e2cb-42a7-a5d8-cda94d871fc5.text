Following a short hiatus, Astaroth came back to life in early February sporting significant
changes in its attack chain. Astaroth is an info-stealing malware that employs multiple fileless
techniques and abuses various legitimate processes to attempt running undetected on
compromised machines. The updated attack chain, which we started seeing in late 2019,
maintains Astaroth’s complex, multi-component nature and continues its pattern of detection
evasion.

encounters recorded in Brazil
When we first blogged about Astaroth’s methods, we noted how it completely lived off the
land to avoid detection: only system tools that are already existing on the machine are ever
executed. In fact, it was an unusual spike in activities related to Windows Management
Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC) that prompted our investigation and eventually
exposed the Astaroth campaign.
Astaroth now completely avoids the use of WMIC and related techniques to bypass existing
detections. Instead, the attackers introduced new techniques that make the attack chain
even stealthier:
Abusing Alternate Data Streams (ADS) to hide malicious payloads
Abusing the legitimate process ExtExport.exe, a highly uncommon attack vector, to
load the payload
Astaroth exemplifies how living-off-the-land techniques have become standard components
of today’s attacks intent on evading security solutions. However, as we mentioned in our
previous blog on Astaroth, fileless threats are very much observable. These threats still leave
a great deal of memory footprint that can be inspected and blocked as they happen. Nextgeneration protection and behavioral containment and blocking capabilities in Microsoft
Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP) lead the charge in exposing
threats like Astaroth.

In this blog, we’ll share our technical analysis of the revamped Astaroth attack chain and
demonstrate how specific Microsoft technologies tackle the multiple advanced components
of the attack.

Dismantling the new Astaroth attack chain
The attackers were careful to ensure the updates didn’t make Astaroth easier to detect; on
the contrary, the updates only make Astaroth’s activities even more invisible.
One of the most significant updates is the use of Alternate Data Stream (ADS), which
Astaroth abuses at several stages to perform various activities. ADS is a file attribute that
allows a user to attach data to an existing file. The stream data and its size are not visible in
File Explorer, so attacks abuse this feature to hide malicious code in plain sight.

In the case of Astaroth, attackers hide binary data inside the ADS of the file desktop.ini,
without changing the file size. By doing this, the attackers create a haven for the payloads,
which are read and decrypted on the fly.

Figure 3. Desktop.ini before and after infection
The complex attack chain, which involves the use of multiple living-off-the-land binaries
(LOLBins), results in the eventual loading of the Astaroth malware directly in memory. When
running, Astaroth decrypts plugins that allow it to steal sensitive information, like email
passwords and browser passwords.
In the succeeding sections, we describe each step of Astaroth’s attack chain in detail.

Arrival
The attack begins with an email with a message in Portuguese that translates to: “Please
find in the link below the STATEMENT #56704/2019 AND LEGAL DECISION, for due
purposes”. The email contains a link that points to URL hosting an archive file,
Arquivo_PDF_<date>.zip, which contains a LNK file with a similarly misleading name. When
clicked, the LNK file runs an obfuscated BAT command line.

Figure 4. Sample email used in latest Astaroth attacks
The BAT command drops a single-line JavaScript file to the Pictures folder and invokes
explorer.exe to run the JavaScript file.

The dropped one-liner script uses the GetObject technique to fetch and run the much larger
main JavaScript directly in memory:

BITSAdmin abuse
The main script then invokes multiple instances of BITSAdmin using a benign looking
command-line to download multiple binary blobs from a command-and-control (C2) server:

The downloaded payloads are encrypted and have the following file names:
masihaddajjaldwwn.gif
masihaddajjalc.jpg
masihaddajjala.jpg
masihaddajjalb.jpg
masihaddajjaldx.gif
masihaddajjalg.gif
masihaddajjalgx.gif
masihaddajjali.gif
masihaddajjalxa.~
masihaddajjalxb.~
masihaddajjalxc.~
masihaddajjal64w.dll
masihaddajjal64q.dll
masihaddajjal64e.dll

Alternate Data Streams abuse

5/13

As mentioned, the new Astaroth attacks use a clever technique of copying downloaded data
to the ADS of desktop.ini. For each download, the content is copied to the ADS, and then the
original content is deleted. These steps are repeated for all downloaded payloads.

Another way that Astaroth abuses ADS is when it runs a script to find installed security
products. A malicious script responsible for enumerating security products is dropped and
then copied as an ADS to an empty text file. The execution command-line looks like this:

ExtExport.exe abuse
The main script combines three separately downloaded binary blobs to form the first-stage
malware code:

The script then uses a LOLBin not previously seen in Astaroth attacks to load the first-stage
malware code: ExtExport.exe, which is a legitimate utility shipped as part of Internet
Explorer. Attackers can load any DLL by passing an attacker-controlled path to the tool. The
tool searches for any DLL with the following file names: mozcrt19.dll, mozsqlite3.dll, or
sqlite3.dll. Attackers need only to rename the malicious payload to one of these names, and
it is loaded by ExtExport.exe.

Userinit.exe abuse
The newly loaded DLL (mozcrt19.dll, mozsqlite3.dll, or sqlite3.dll) is a proxy that reads three
binary ADS streams (desktop.ini:masihaddajjalxa.~, desktop.ini:masihaddajjalxb.~, and
desktop.ini:masihaddajjalxc.~) and combines these into a DLL. The newly formed DLL is the
second-stage malware code and is loaded in the same process using the reflective DLL
loading technique.
The newly loaded DLL is also a proxy that reads and decrypts another ADS stream
(desktop.ini:masihaddajjalgx.gif) into a DLL. This DLL is injected into userinit.exe using the
process hollowing technique.
6/13

The newly loaded DLL inside userinit.exe is again a proxy that reads and decrypts another
ADS stream (desktop.ini:masihaddajjalg.gif) into a DLL. This DLL is the malicious info-stealer
known as Astaroth and is reflectively loaded inside userinit.exe. Hence, Astaroth never
touches the disk and is loaded directly in memory, making it very evasive.

Astaroth payload
When running, the Astaroth payload then reads and decrypts more components from the
ADS stream of desktop.ini (desktop.ini:masihaddajjaldwwn.gif,
desktop.ini:masihaddajjalc.jpg, desktop.ini:masihaddajjala.jpg,
desktop.ini:masihaddajjalb.jpg, and desktop.ini:masihaddajjali.gif).
Some of these components are credential-stealing plugins hidden inside the ADS stream of
desktop.ini. Astaroth abuses these plugins to steal information from compromised systems:
NirSoft’s MailPassView – an email client password recovery tool
NirSoft’s WebBrowserPassView – a web browser password recovery tool
As mentioned, Astaroth also finds installed security products. It then attempts to disable
these security products. For Microsoft Defender Antivirus customers, tamper protection
prevents such malicious and unauthorized changes to security settings.

Comprehensive, dynamic protection against living-off-the-land,
fileless, and other sophisticated threats with Microsoft Threat
Protection
Attackers are increasingly turning to living-off-the-land techniques to attempt running
undetected for as long as possible on systems. Because these attacks use multiple
executables that are native to the system and have legitimate uses, they require a
comprehensive, behavior-based approach to detection.
Microsoft Threat Protection combines and orchestrates into a single solution the capabilities
of multiple Microsoft security services to coordinate protection, detection, response, and
prevention across endpoints, email, identities, and apps.
In the case of Astaroth, Office 365 ATP detects the malware delivery via email. Using
detonation-based heuristics and machine learning, Office 365 ATP inspects links and
attachments to identify malicious artifacts.
On endpoints, next-generation protection capabilities in Microsoft Defender ATP detect and
prevent some components of Astaroth’s new attack chain. Notably, through Antimalware
Scan Interface (AMSI), Microsoft Defender ATP can inspect the encrypted malicious scripts
used in the initial stages of the attack.

For the more sophisticated sections of the attack chain, behavioral blocking and containment
capabilities provide dynamic protection that can stop malicious behaviors and process trees.
Behavior-based protections are key to exposing living-off-the-land threats that abuse and
hide behind legitimate processes. These protections identify suspicious behavior sequences
and advanced attack techniques observed on the client, which are used as triggers to
analyze the process tree using real-time machine learning models in the cloud.

Figure 5. Preventive and behavior-based blocking & containment protections against
Astaroth
These behavior-based detections raise alerts in Microsoft Defender Security Center. With
behavioral blocking and containment, not only are evasive threats exposed, detected, and
stopped; security operations personnel are also notified so they can thoroughly investigate
and remediate the root cause.

Microsoft Defender ATP’s EDR capabilities also have very strong coverage of advanced
techniques employed by Astaroth, including cross-process migration, code injection, and use
of LOLBins.

We expect Astaroth to further develop and increase in complexity, as long-running malware
campaigns do. We will continue to watch this evolving threat and ensure that customers are
protected from future updates through durable behavior-based protections.
