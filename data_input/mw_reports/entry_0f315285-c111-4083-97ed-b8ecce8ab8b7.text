Carbanak is an APT-style campaign targeting (but not limited to) financial institutions,[1] that
was discovered in 2014[2] by the Russian cyber security company Kaspersky Lab.[3] It utilizes
malware that is introduces into systems running Microsoft Windows[4] using phishing emails,
[3][5] which is then used to steal money from banks. The hacker group is said to have stolen
over 900 million dollars, from the banks as well as from over a thousand private customers.
The criminals were able to manipulate their access to the respective banking networks in
order to steal the money in a variety of ways. In some instances, ATMs were instructed to
dispense cash without having to locally interact with the terminal. Money mules would collect
the money and transfer it over the SWIFT network to the criminals’ accounts, Kaspersky
said. The Carbanak group went so far as to alter databases and pump up balances on
existing accounts and pocketing the difference unbeknownst to the user whose original
balance is still intact.[6]
Their intended targets were primarily in Russia, followed by the United States, Germany,
China and Ukraine, according to Kaspersky Lab. One bank lost $7.3 million when its ATMs
were programmed to spew cash at certain times that henchmen would then collect, while a
separate firm had $10 million taken via its online platform.
Kaspersky Lab is helping to assist in investigations and countermeasures that disrupt
malware operations and cybercriminal activity. During the investigations they provide
technical expertise such as analyzing infection vectors, malicious programs, supported
command and control infrastructure and exploitation methods.[7]
FireEye published research tracking further activities, referring to the group as FIN7,
including an SEC-themed spear phishing campaign.[8] Proofpoint also published research
linking the group to the Bateleur backdoor, and expanded the list of targets to U.S.-based
chain restaurants, hospitality organizations, retailers, merchant services, suppliers and
others beyond their initial financial services focus.[9]
On 26 October 2020, PRODAFT (Switzerland) started publishing internal details of the
Fin7/Carbanak group and tools they use during their operation.[10] Published information is
claimed to be originated from a single OPSEC failure on the threat actor’s side.[11]
On March 26, 2018, Europol claimed to have arrested the "mastermind" of the Carbanak and
associated Cobalt or Cobalt Strike group in Alicante, Spain, in an investigation led by the
Spanish National Police with the cooperation of law enforcement in multiple countries as well

as private cybersecurity companies. The group's campaigns appear to have continued,
however, with the Hudson's Bay Company breach using point of sale malware in 2018 being
attributed to the group.[12]

Controversy
Some controversy exists around the Carbanak attacks, as they were seemingly described
several months earlier in a report by the Internet security companies Group-IB (Russia) and
Fox-IT (The Netherlands) that dubbed the attack Anunak.[13] The Anunak report shows also
a greatly reduced amount of financial losses and according to a statement issued by Fox-IT
after the release of The New York Times article, the compromise of banks outside Russia did
not match their research.[14] Also in an interview conducted by Russian newspaper
Kommersant the controversy between the claims of Kaspersky Lab and Group-IB come to
light where Group-IB claims no banks outside of Russia and Ukraine were hit, and the
activity outside of that region was focused on Point of Sale systems.[15]
Reuters issued a statement referencing a Private Industry Notification issued by the FBI and
USSS (United States Secret Service) claiming they have not received any reports that
Carbanak has affected the financial sector.[16] Two representative groups of the US banking
industry FS-ISAC and ABA (American Bankers Association) in an interview with Bank
Technology News say no US banks have been affected.[17]
