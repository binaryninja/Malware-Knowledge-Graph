THREAT PROFILE: AN ANALYSIS OF THE EGREGOR RANSOMWARE

INTRODUCTION
Egregor is considered to be one of the most prolific ransomware threat groups. Yet it
gained this reputation in a very short time due to its uncompromising double extortion
methodology.
In this report, we will provide a detailed and anonymized coverage of Egregor’s tactics,
techniques, and procedures (TTPs) following an incident response activity that was conducted
at the end of November 2020.
The goal of this report is to shed light on some very different techniques for initial access,
persistence, and exfiltration than what is typically reported on with respect to the Egregor
group. In this report, you will not find any indication of Qbot or Cobalt Strike beacons.
Though we are not going to provide an exact attribution, you will find evidence in the report
that may indicate a connection to the Revil group. We will provide evidence such as upload
accounts, download links, and services that can result in additional community wide research
which hopefully can lead to further conclusions.
We invite the research community to share additional insights that may correlate with the
published IOCs.

TECHNICAL INTRODUCTION
Any incident response involving business compromise usually starts with the end - the impact. When the impact
is ransomware, incident investigation is particularly difficult as it is done in parallel to containment activities.
This investigation wasn’t different from most that involve ransomware;
•

The AD is compromised and the ransomware is deployed directly from the AD.

•

A search and mapping of suspicious connections to the AD are correlated to legitimate activities and
connections of privileged users. RDP, pass the hash, and other techniques are taken into account.

•

Compromised credentials or/and a lateral movement chain is established and patient zero is identified.
Obviously, if logs exist, SIEM, event viewers, VPN, AV, and other logs are considered.

•

In the case of ransomware, the customer would usually like to know what was exfiltrated to be able to
calculate business continuity risks.

•

In the last stage, victims like to have a recommendation report for corrective actions that can be applied to
the network.

Our incident investigation revealed that the Egregor threat group most probably exploited a VPN vulnerability
to access the internal network from a Tor exit node. The attackers then scanned the network while looking for
a vulnerable server. They quickly identified and exploited a second vulnerability on an old 2003 application
server. This application server became our patient zero. The attackers then moved laterally between file
share, application, virtualization, update, and secondary AD servers until they infiltrated to the AD. Next,
they exfiltrated data through known services such as MegaUpload directly from the AD. As a final step, they
encrypted the network.

THREAT PROFILE: AN ANALYSIS OF THE EGREGOR RANSOMWARE

INITIAL ACCESS
The current assumption is that the adversaries successfully exploited a non-patched VPN as no SSL login event
was registered while the attackers had been assigned with a local IP. The local IP was assigned to a Tor exit
node; 162.247.74.74 which belongs to a Calyx Institute. Immediately following an assignment of the local IP, the
adversaries initiated a standard network scan as part of a discovery process. Though different users, passwords,
and domains were used, we successfully identified the attacker machine VM:
Device name: MAVERIK-PC, Client OS version: Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate Edition Service Pack 1, 64-bit
As soon as the adversaries identified an older unpatched server (2003), they exploited a second vulnerability
which allowed them to log in as a new user ”Lalartu”. Lalartu immediately triggered our suspicion of a possible
connection to the Revil and GandCrab groups. At first the attackers tried to exploit other servers in the network
using the same username.
The vulnerable application server became
our patient zero, and our goal was to
identify as much as possible by correlating
indicators from within and outside the
server. This became extra difficult as the
attackers wiped the logs from the server.
Figure 2: The vulnerable application server.

Nevertheless, we succeeded to rebuild the timeline and
identify most of the artifacts that were used by the attackers.
We assume that at least 3 attackers were working on this
environment in parallel.

PERSISTENCE & BACKDOORS
As with most similar attack chains, the adversaries needed to maintain access to the servers in case they
would lose the connection. They surely needed to avoid the re-exploitation of the network. Due to an opened
outbound connection to the internet, they were able to install legitimate remote connection software:
•

AnyDesk - was dropped on the first login on almost every server that has been compromised

Figure 4: Anydesk dropped

•

SupRemo (supremocontrol.com) - was installed in parallel to AnyDesk and was used as a backup.

Figure 5: SupRemo installed

In addition to having a remote control using the mentioned applications, the attacker logged in through VPN
using legitimate domain administrator credentials as soon as they were gathered from the servers.

DOWNLOADED TOOLS
As most communication has been outgoing from within the target business, attackers needed a way to
download the ransomware and the tools they would use for discovery and lateral movement without leaving
any trace of the C2 IP.
Just after installing Chrome, they downloaded a 7zip installer and a net scanner from known sources:
•

https://www.7-zip.org/download.html

•

https://www.softperfect.com/download/files/netscan_portable.zip
(have been also downloaded under different names such as old.exe)

In other cases, the attackers downloaded Mimikatz and PowerTool executables:
•

Mimikatz used for credential collection was downloaded only on the “patient” zero server (2003).

•

PowerTool was downloaded on a small number of servers under different names with slight executable
modifications (e.g. 777.exe and kaav32.exe). This was to identify and tamper with already installed and
running security solutions.

File.io
Most of the tools have been downloaded using the file.io file share service with a one time download link.
E.g. hxxps://file[.]io/WmCH77xcKmbJ
7zip archive was downloaded through file.io, the archive included:
•

PsExec (SysInternals)

•

Sdelete.exe (SysInternals)

•

BAT file to execute the ransomware (described later in the report)

•

BAT file to deploy / distribute the ransomware (described later in the report)

AES.ONE
Attackers also used an intriguing backup option for file sharing. Once the first variant of the ransomware was
detected by an installed leading AV solution, attackers turned to a less popular and highly questionable AES.
ONE file sharing solution. They specifically used it to download only the ransomware component with the other
described tools in a previous bullet.

pc3/2iopi0o8coob22n8s60pn6b7ps/b6bbf78b901c1fdf/

Figure 7: The downloaded ransomware component.

AES.ONE was previously associated with Russian
campaigns within the US and conveniently vanished
and was replaced by fghj.su on December 3
through December 7 (10 days after the massive
attacks). Some fghj.su links still point back to aes.
one.
Figure 8: fghj.su and AES.ONE

EXFILTRATION
As the attackers had access to multiple servers including file share servers and ADs we have established a
partial timeline for exfiltration of memory dumps and files. We identified exfiltration attempts mainly from the
primary AD following a successful share of folders from the file share servers with the AD.

File share services - lsass dump
As soon as the attackers compromised the primary AD, they installed Chrome and decided to generate lsass
memory dump using PowerShell and exfiltrate it through known sharing services;
•

https://wetransfer.com/

•

https://www.sendspace.com/

Further evidence that this group could be associated with other Russian based attacks is the misspelling of the
word “space” in Google a search that one of the attackers made, typing “sendspase.”
Unfortunately for the attacker, the network was extremely slow and the upload broke the existing connection to
the AD.
During the next couple of hours, attackers tried
to reconnect to the AD using all available domain
administrator’s credentials both through RDP and
through PSEXEC service which eventually worked.

Figure 9: Attackers tried to reconnect.

This led the attacker to execute a speed test while trying to identify the issue and then to install a MegaUpload
service on the AD.

MegaUpload
The decision to install a MegaUpload service required the attackers to
register a new user for this service (MEGAsyncSetup64.exe).
Luckily we were able to recover the user “Tacok” and his temp email by
tjuln.com. “Tjuln” mail is handled by mail.mailerhost.net, a known shared
service that is hosted on AWS. This is why the IP can not be blacklisted.
This is also likely the reason the attackers used the email.
Figure 10: The Tacok user and email.

Additional investigation of the email domain revealed a high abuse rate on the same date of the attack. This could
indicate that the attackers executed the same attack on multiple targets at the same time.

RANSOMWARE
Following a successful exfiltration, ransomware was deployed from an AD shared folder. We succeeded in identifying
many of the scripts, but not all as many of the artifacts have been either overwritten by sdelete or re-encrypted by
the ransomware itself.

Figure 12: The ransomware scripts.

The attackers deployed the ransomware in 3 ways depending on the endpoint environment - the differentiator
is usually the deployment BAT file (nur.bat, nur2.bat, nur3.bat):
•

Nur3.bat - direct execution of local BAT file that executes the ransomware locally (on a set of selected
targets such as file shares)

•

Nur.bat - Task scheduler with remote execution of the ransomware (most servers)

Figure 13: Deployment of the ransomware.

•

Nur2.bat - most endpoints - direct remote psexec with remote BAT execution from remote (AD) share (will
be described below)

wc.bat
The Egregor deployment script is a .bat file that remotely executes Egregor in chunks using psexec (about 20
local IPs per execution line). Every command is executed with a connection timeout of 10 seconds.

Figure 14: The Egregor deployment script.

wc_1.txt
As mentioned above, every execution line has a unique input
file that contains about 20 unique local IP addresses that were
previously identified through the netscan tool.

Nur2.bat

Figure 15: Unique local IP addresses

The command that is executed on a remote machine, Salsa.dll, is the Egregor ransomware that requires a
decoding password for its successful execution. As mentioned above (the Downloaded Tools section) we have
identified more than a single version of the ransomware dropped on the servers due to a previous detection of
the first variant.

Figure 16: The Salsa.dll file.

s.bat
To remove the attacker traces, sdelete was used to overwrite the trace files (32 overwrites).

Figure 17: Sdelete

As we already know, the Egregor group threatens to leak sensitive data as part of their double extortion
attempts where they actually release chunks of exfiltrated information to the public. Their demands are also
extremely high and can lead to more than $40 million.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
As can be seen from the latest waves of ransomware campaigns; extortion, human-operated propagation,
exploitation of VPN applications, and meteoric encryption are a landmark change in the current attack
landscape.
Enterprises must adhere to the zero trust principles in order to minimize the risk of exposure to a ransomware
attack, basic recommendations would be:
•

Deny network communication to all and from all, allow only on demand (minimize the risk for backdoors).

•

Apply MFA to minimize lateral movement risk.

•

Deploy runtime zero trust preventive technology such as Morphisec to keep your runtime applications safe.

•

Minimize administrator privileges.

•

Implement basic attack surface reduction rules such as script prevention and psexec prevention.

•

Isolate your backups and test those regularly.
