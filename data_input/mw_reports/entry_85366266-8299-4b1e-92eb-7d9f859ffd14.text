Ransomware is dominating the eCrime landscape and is a significant concern for
organizations, as it can cause major disruptions. ECrime accounted for over 75% of
interactive intrusion activity from July 2020 to June 2021, according to the recent
CrowdStrike 2021 Threat Hunting Report. The continually evolving big game hunting (BGH)
business model has widespread adoption with access brokers facilitating access, with a
major driver being dedicated leak sites to apply pressure for victim compliance. Ransomware
continues to evolve, with threat actors implementing components and features that make it
more difficult for victims to recover their data.

Lockbit 2.0 Going for the Popularity Vote
The LockBit ransomware family has constantly been adding new capabilities, including
tampering with Microsoft Server Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) by interacting with the
legitimate vssadmin.exe Windows tool. Capabilities such as lateral movement or destruction
of shadow copies are some of the most effective and pervasive tactics ransomware uses.

The LockBit 2.0 ransomware has similar capabilities to other ransomware families, including
the ability to bypass UAC (User Account Control), self-terminate or check the victim’s system
language before encryption to ensure that it’s not in a Russian-speaking country.
For example, LockBit 2.0 checks the default language of the system and the current user by
using the Windows API calls GetSystemDefaultUILanguage and
GetUserDefaultUILanguage . If the language code identifier matches the one specified,
the program will exit. Figure 2 shows how the language validation is performed (function call
49B1C0 ).

LockBit can even perform a silent UAC bypass without triggering any alerts or the UAC
popup, enabling it to encrypt silently. It first begins by checking if it’s running under Admin
privileges. It does that by using specific API functions to get the process token
( NTOpenProcessToken ), create a SID identifier to check the permission level
( CreateWellKnownSid ), and then check whether the current process has sufficient admin
privileges ( CheckTokenMembership and ZwQueryInformationToken functions).

If the process is not running under Admin, it will attempt to do so by initializing a COM object
with elevation of the COM interface by using the elevation moniker COM initialization method
with guid: Elevation:Administrator!new:{3E5FC7F9-9A51-4367-9063A120244FBEC7} . A similar elevation trick has been used by DarkSide and REvil ransomware
families in the past.
LockBit 2.0 also has lateral movement capabilities and can scan for other hosts to spread to
other network machines. For example, it calls the GetLogicalDrives function to retrieve a
bitmask of currently available drives to list all available drives on the system. If the found

drive is a network share, it tries to identify the name of the resource and connect to it using
API functions, such as WNetGetConnectionW , PathRemoveBackslashW ,
OpenThreadToken and DuplicateToken .
In essence, it’s no longer about targeting and compromising individual machines but entire
networks. REvil and LockBit are just some of the recent ransomware families that feature this
capability, while others such as Ryuk and WastedLocker share the same functionality. The
CrowdStrike Falcon OverWatch™ team found that in 36% of intrusions, adversaries can
move laterally to additional hosts in less than 30 minutes, according to the CrowdStrike 2021
Threat Hunting Report.
Another interesting feature of LockBit 2.0 is that it prints out the ransom note message on all
connected printers found in the network, adding public shaming to its encryption and data
exfiltration capabilities.

VSS Tampering: An Established Ransomware Tactic
The tampering and deletion of VSS shadow copies is a common tactic to prevent data
recovery. Adversaries will often abuse legitimate Microsoft administrator tools to disable and
remove VSS shadow copies. Common tools include Windows Management Instrumentation
(WMI), BCDEdit (a command-line tool for managing Boot Configuration Data) and
vssadmin.exe. LockBit 2.0 utilizes the following WMI command line for deleting shadow
copies:
C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c vssadmin delete shadows /all /quiet & wmic shadowcopy
delete & bcdedit /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures & bcdedit /set
{default} recoveryenabled no

The use of preinstalled operating system tools, such as WMI, is not new. Still, adversaries
have started abusing them as part of the initial access tactic to perform tasks without
requiring a malicious executable file to be run or written to the disk on the compromised
system. Adversaries have moved beyond malware by using increasingly sophisticated and
stealthy techniques tailor-made to evade autonomous detections, as revealed by
CrowdStrike Threat Graph®, which showed that 68% of detections indexed in April-June
2021 were malware-free.

VSS Protection with CrowdStrike
CrowdStrike Falcon takes a layered approach to detecting and preventing ransomware by
using behavior-based indicators of attack (IOAs) and advanced machine learning, among
other capabilities. We are committed to continually improving the efficacy of our technologies
against known and unknown threats and adversaries.

5/9

CrowdStrike’s enhanced IOA detections accurately distinguish malicious behavior from
benign, resulting in high-confidence detections. This is especially important when
ransomware shares similar capabilities with legitimate software, like backup solutions. Both
can enumerate directories and write files that on the surface may seem inconsequential, but
when correlated with other indicators on the endpoint, can identify a legitimate attack.
Correlating seemingly ordinary behaviors allows us to identify opportunities for coverage
across a wide range of malware families. For example, a single IOA can provide coverage
for multiple families and previously unseen ones.
CrowdStrike’s recent innovation involves protecting shadow copies from being tampered
with, adding another protection layer to mitigate ransomware attacks. Protecting shadow
copies helps potentially compromised systems restore encrypted data with much less time
and effort. Ultimately, this helps reduce operational costs associated with person-hours spent
spinning up encrypted systems post-compromise.
The Falcon platform can prevent suspicious processes from tampering with shadow copies
and performing actions such as changing file size to render the backup useless. For
instance, should a LockBit 2.0 ransomware infection occur and attempt to use the legitimate
Microsoft administrator tool (vssadmin.exe) to manipulate shadow copies, Falcon
immediately detects this behavior and prevents the ransomware from deleting or tampering
with them, as shown in Figure 4.

In essence, while a ransomware infection might be able to encrypt files on a compromised
endpoint, Falcon can prevent ransomware from tampering with shadow copies and
potentially expedite data recovery for your organization.

vssadmin is used to list the shadow copies. Notice the shadow copy has been deleted after
execution.

Below is the same Lockbit 2.0 execution, now with Falcon and VSS protection enabled. The
shadow copy is not deleted even though the ransomware has run successfully. Please note,
we specifically allowed the ransomware to run during this demonstration.

CrowdStrike prevents the destruction and tampering of shadow copies with volume shadow
service backup protection, retaining the snapshots in a recoverable state regardless of threat
actors using traditional or new novel techniques. This allows for instant recovery of live
systems post-attack through direct snapshot tools or system recovery.
VSS shadow copy protection is just one of the new improvements added to CrowdStrike’s
layered approach. We remain committed to our mission to stop breaches, and constantly
improving our machine learning and behavior-based detection and protection technologies
enables the Falcon platform to identify and protect against tactics, techniques and
procedures associated with sophisticated adversaries and threats.

CrowdStrike’s Layered Approach Provides Best-in-Class Protection
The Falcon platform unifies intelligence, technology and expertise to successfully detect and
protect against ransomware. Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered machine learning and
behavioral IOAs, fueled by a massive data set of trillions of events per week and threat actor
intelligence, can identify and block ransomware. Coupled with expert threat hunters that
proactively see and stop even the stealthiest of attacks, the Falcon platform uses a layered
approach to protect the things that matter most to your organization from ransomware and
other threats.

intelligence and expertise needed to successfully stop breaches. For fully managed detection
and response (MDR), Falcon Complete™ seasoned security professionals deliver 403% ROI
and 100% confidence.
