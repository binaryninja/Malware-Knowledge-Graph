In summer 2019, Kaspersky ICS CERT identified a new wave of phishing emails containing
various malicious attachments. The emails target companies and organizations from different
sectors of the economy that are associated with industrial production in one way or another.
We reported these attacks in 2018 in an article entitled “Attacks on industrial enterprises using
RMS and TeamViewer”, but recent data shows that the attackers have modified their attack
techniques and that the number of enterprises facing the threat of infection is growing.
Before publishing this report, we waited for the vendor of the RMS software to make changes
to its services to ensure that the results of this research could not be used to exploit
vulnerabilities.

This report in a nutshell


From 2018 to at least the early fall of 2020, attackers sent phishing emails laced with
malware.



The attacks make use of social engineering techniques and legitimate documents, such
as memos and documents detailing equipment settings or other industrial process
information, which have apparently been stolen from the company under attack or its
business partners.



The attacks still use remote administration utilities. The graphical user interface of these
utilities is hidden by the malware, enabling the attackers to control infected systems
without their users’ knowledge.



In the new version of the malware, the attackers changed the notification channel used
after infecting a new system: instead of malware command-and-control servers, they use
the web interface of the RMS remote administration utility’s cloud infrastructure.



Stealing money from the organization under attack remains the main objective of the
attackers.



During an ongoing attack, the cybercriminals use spyware and the Mimikatz utility to steal
authentication credentials that are subsequently used to infect other systems on the
enterprise network.

Technical Analysis
Since we described the technical details of this series of attacks in our previous report, Attacks
on industrial enterprises using RMS and TeamViewer, in this document we only list the main
stages of an attack and describe the changes to the attackers’ tactics and toolset that have
been implemented since the publication of the previous report.

Spreading
Phishing emails used in this attack are in most cases disguised as business correspondence
between organizations. Specifically, the attackers send claim letters on behalf of a large
industrial company.

Phishing email disguised as a claim letter
In the earlier attack series, the attackers used a sender email address with a domain name
that was similar to the official website address of the organization on whose behalf their
phishing emails were sent. Now they use public email services to send their phishing emails
and they use a different technique to mislead message recipients and persuade them to open
a malicious attachment: they pretend to be a real business partner or to represent a real
subsidiary of the company under attack and ask the recipient to view the documents attached
by the deadline specified in the email, explaining the request by the approaching end of a
purchase tender, possible penalties or the need to review equipment configuration data as
soon as possible.
It should also be emphasized that the phishing emails are individually crafted for each specific
company that is attacked. This is demonstrated by the fact that the name of the company
under attack is mentioned in the email text, as well as by the documents used by the attackers
as attachments (descriptions of the documents are provided below). In some of the cases
identified earlier, the attackers also addressed the recipient by his or her full name.

Phishing email sent on behalf of a contractor
Attachments used in phishing emails are password-protected archives, with the password
provided in the message body. The attackers explain this method of sending information by
referring to confidentiality considerations in the message body, but in reality password
protection prevents files stored in the archive from being scanned with antivirus tools.

Malware Features
The archive attached to a phishing email contains several malicious obfuscated JS scripts that
have an identical functionality but slightly different structure due to different code obfuscation
techniques being used. The script names are usually disguised as document names.
If a user runs one of these scripts, two files are unpacked and opened: a malicious program
detected as HEUR:Backdoor.Win32.Generic, and a legitimate PDF file. Some JS script
variants found in phishing emails download these files from a remote server rather than
extracting them from the script’s body.
In earlier attacks, to ensure that the user didn’t have questions regarding the absence of the
documents mentioned in the message body and to distract the user while installing the
malware, the attackers opened a damaged PDF document or image or launched a legitimate
software installer.

In their later attacks, the threat actor began to use actual documents related to the attacked
organization’s area of work. A document can look like one created by a business partner or
even the attacked organization itself. Specifically, documents used in attacks include scan
copies of memos, letters to subsidiaries and contractors, as well as procurement
documentation forms that were apparently stolen earlier.

PDF document containing instructions for subsidiaries, used by the attackers
A fact of particular interest is that in some cases, the attackers used documents containing
industrial equipment configuration data and other information related to the industrial process.
Specifically, screenshots from the DIGSI application have been used. The application is
designed to configure relay systems manufactured by Siemens.

DIGSI is used by electric power facilities, such as substations, to configure their relay
protection systems.

We also found screenshots with transformer oscillograms in documents used by the attackers:

Vector diagrams with oscillograms
It is worth noting that the last screenshot shows oscillograms for a system at the moment of an
accident.
Phishing emails with such screenshots do not call for the settings shown in attached
documents to be implemented. It is most likely that the attackers use documents with the
above screenshots to distract the personnel while the malware is being installed. Since the
data mentioned above can provide a relay protection expert with information on standard
settings used at the facility, the fact that the attackers have such screenshots at their disposal
is cause for concern.
The JS script then launches the malware, which installs a version of TeamViewer, a remote
administration tool (RAT), modified by the attackers. As in earlier attacks, the attackers use a
malicious DLL library to hide the graphical user interface in order to control the infected
system without the user’s knowledge.
If additional information needs to be collected, the attackers download an additional set of
malware selected specifically for each victim. This can be spyware designed to collect
credentials for a variety of programs and services, including email clients, browsers,
SSH/FTP/Telnet clients, as well as recording keypresses and making screenshots. In some
cases, the Mimikatz utility is used to collect account credentials for Windows accounts entered
on the compromised system. The use of Mimikatz poses a particular danger, because it can
provide the attackers with access to a large number of systems on the enterprise’s network.
In most cases, the attackers disguise malware components as Windows components to hide
traces of malicious activity on the system.

Infrastructure
While analyzing the new series of attacks, we noticed two ways in which the infrastructure is
organized differently from that used in earlier attacks.
First, the attackers use resources disguised as websites of existing Russian-speaking
companies to store files downloaded by malicious JS scripts at the system infection stage.
The second and more important difference is that the attackers no longer use a malware
command-and-control server in their communication with infected systems.
The main reason for having a malware command-and-control server in this type of attack was
the need to get the infected machine’s ID in the TeamViewer system. The attackers already
had any other information they needed (the password required to connect was provided in a
special configuration file). In the new series of attacks, the attackers sent the infected
machine’s TeamViewer ID using the legitimate infrastructure of the RMS remote
administration system.
This was possible because the RMS remote administration infrastructure has a dedicated web
service designed to notify the administrator that an RMS distribution package has been
installed on a remote system. To send the notification, the RMS server generates an email
message that contains the machine’s ID in the RMS system in the message body. For the
message to be generated, it is sufficient for the RMS client to send an HTTP POST request to
the dedicated web page, providing the following data: product name, ID of the language pack
used in the system, user name, computer name, email address to which the notification should
be delivered, and the machine’s ID in the RMS system assigned after installing the program.

Attack kill chain
The underlying mechanism of the web service contained a vulnerability: it did not use any kind
of authorization procedure. The malicious DLL responsible for hiding the TeamViewer graphic
interface included code for sending the request described above to the RMS server. However,
it sent the machine’s ID in the TeamViewer system instead of its ID in the RMS system.

RMS AND TEAMVIEWER: NEW DATA

The ID length in the TeamViewer system is different from the ID length in the RMS system;
however, since there is no verification of the contents of fields sent to the server in the HTTP
POST request, a notification message with information on a newly infected machine was
successfully delivered to the attacker’s address.
Kaspersky ICS CERT has notified RMS developers that their infrastructure is being used for
criminal purposes, providing them with all the technical details needed to close the
vulnerability. To date, the vulnerability has not been closed by the developers, but a
workaround, filtration based on an address whitelist, has been implemented.
In other words, the functionality still works, but notification emails are only sent to email
addresses included in a special list of customers ‘verified’ by RMS developers.
For technical details about this vulnerability please contact: ics-cert@kaspersky.com

Victims
As mentioned above, the vast majority of attacked systems are industrial enterprises in Russia
representing various sectors of the economy. We identified attacks on companies from the
following industries:


Manufacturing



Oil and gas



Metal industry



Engineering



Energy



Construction



Mining



Logistics

Consequently, this is not a case of an attack narrowly targeting one specific industry; however,
since most legitimate documents used in the attacks are from the energy sector, it can be
assumed that the attackers have a particular interest in the sector.

Attribution
We are convinced that a Russian-speaking group is behind these attacks.
The main arguments in favor of this theory were offered in our previous report, “Attacks on
industrial enterprises using RMS and TeamViewer”.
Note also that the code used to send requests to the RMS server, which was identified in the
process of analyzing the new version of the malicious DLL, contains a language ID for the
Russian localization of the operating system.
According to available information, the main objective of the criminals is to steal money from
victim organizations’ accounts. This means that the attackers must have a good understanding
of the financial workflow, which differs in some of its aspects from country to country, and
support the appropriate infrastructure for cash withdrawal.

The group does not use any sophisticated tactics or technologies, but it carefully prepares
each attack and expertly uses social engineering techniques, as well as technologies that are
already known from attacks staged by other criminal groups.
We believe that the group includes people responsible for the technical aspect of infecting
victims’ systems, as well as people responsible for financial operations, i.e., for stealing money
from the group’s victims.

Conclusions
The threat actor continues to attack industrial enterprises successfully using relatively simple
techniques, but its methods are evolving. To persuade users of the legitimacy of phishing
emails, criminals have begun to use documents that were apparently stolen during earlier
attacks. It is worth noting that some of the documents used for this purpose contain
information on industrial equipment settings and industrial process parameters. This is one
more reason to believe that these attacks specifically target industrial enterprises.
The main technical change in the attacks is that the attackers have discarded the most
vulnerable stage in data collection and transmission – that is, malware command-and-control
servers, which can be disconnected by the hosting provider or blocked by information security
systems. Instead, new system infection notifications are delivered via the legitimate web
interface of the RMS remote administration utility’s cloud infrastructure. Resources disguised
as legitimate websites of existing organizations are used to store malware samples.
The attackers have full control of an infected system from the moment it becomes infected.
Stealing money from the organization’s accounts remains their main objective. When the
attackers connect to a victim’s computer, they look for financial and accounting software
(1C accounting software, bank-client, etc.). In addition, they find and analyze procurementrelated accounting documents and peruse the email correspondence of the enterprise’s
employees. After that, the attackers look for various ways in which they can commit financial
fraud. We believe that the criminals are able to substitute the bank details used to pay
invoices.
Clearly, the attackers’ remote access to infected systems also poses other threats, such as
the organization’s sensitive data being leaked, systems being put out of operation, etc. As the
latest events have shown, the attackers use documents that were probably stolen from
organizations to carry out subsequent attacks, including attacks on victim companies’
partners.

Recommendations


Train employees at enterprises in using email securely and, specifically, in identifying
phishing messages



Restrict the ability of programs to gain SeDebugPrivilege privileges (wherever possible)



Install antivirus software with support for centrally managing the security policy on all
systems; keep the antivirus databases and program modules of security solutions up to
date



Use accounts with domain administrator privileges only when necessary. After using such
accounts, restart the system on which the authentication was performed



Implement a password policy with password strength and regular password change
requirements



If it is suspected that some systems are infected: remove all third-party remote
administration utilities, scan these systems with antivirus software and force a change of
passwords for all accounts that have been used to log on to compromised systems



Monitor network connections for any traces of remote administration utilities installed
without proper authorization. Make a special emphasis on the use of RMS and
TeamViewer utilities



Use network activity filtration systems to block connections to servers and IP addresses
listed in Appendix I – Indicators of Compromise



Never use obsolete versions of the TeamViewer utility (versions 6.0 and earlier). To
discover any instances of obsolete versions of TeamViewer being used, the YARA rule
provided in Appendix I – Indicators of Compromise can be used



It should be noted that, since the attack uses legitimate remote administration software,
that software can remain on the victim’s computer and continue operating even when the
malicious downloader has been removed. If remote administration software has been
identified at the stage of scanning corporate systems, it should be determined in each
case whether it was installed legitimately
