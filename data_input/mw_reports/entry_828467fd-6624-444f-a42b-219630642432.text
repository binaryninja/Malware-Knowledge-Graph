The Australian Cyber Security Centre Threat Report 2015
Foreword
The cyber threat to Australian organisations is undeniable, unrelenting and continues to grow. If an
organisation is connected to the internet, it is vulnerable. The incidents in the public eye are just the tip
of the iceberg.
Australia must be vigilant and proactive in its approach to cyber security, investing resources to meet
the challenges of a complex cyber environment.
Compromise is expensive. It can include financial losses, damage to reputation, loss of intellectual
property and disruption to business. Australia cannot afford this.
This is the first unclassified Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) Threat Report. All ACSC partner
agencies have contributed to provide information tailored for Australian organisations about the threats
their networks face from cyber espionage, cyber attacks and cybercrime. It also contains mitigation
and remediation information to assist organisations to prevent, and respond to, the threat.
To combat the threats detailed in this report and reduce the risk of compromise, organisations must
move now to implement cyber security measures to make Australia a harder target, increase the
confidence of Australians when they are online, and maximise the benefits of the internet for
Australian organisations.
Ultimately, this will see organisations and their users taking greater responsibility for the security of
their networks and information. The ACSC has been established to help in this process.
The information in this report is designed to assist the achievement of a more cyber secure Australia.
Your feedback is welcome.

Introduction
The number, type and sophistication of cyber security threats to Australia and Australians are
increasing. Due to the varied nature of motivations for cyber adversaries targeting Australian
organisations, organisations could be a target for malicious activities even if they do not think the
information held on their networks is valuable, or that their business would be of interest to cyber
adversaries.
This first unclassified report by the ACSC describes the range of cyber adversaries targeting
Australian networks, explains their motivations, the malicious activities they are conducting and their
impact, and provides specific examples of activity targeting Australian networks during 2014. This
report also offers mitigation advice on how organisations can defend against these activities.
The ACSC’s ability to detect and defend against sophisticated cyber threats continues to improve. But
cyber adversaries are constantly improving their tradecraft in their attempts to defeat our network
defences and exploit the new technologies we embrace.
There are gaps in our understanding of the extent and nature of malicious activity, particularly against
the business sector. The ACSC is reaching out to industry to build partnerships to improve our
collective understanding. Future iterations of the Threat Report will benefit from these partnerships
and help to close gaps in our knowledge.

The Australian Threat Environment
Australian government and businesses increasingly rely on the internet to deliver products and
services. This comes with risks – Australian networks and their users are vulnerable to malicious cyber
activity such as cyber espionage, cyber attack and cybercrime.
Australia’s information and communications technology (ICT) security community, academia and
decision makers in government and business need to:


keep pace with developments



identify new vulnerabilities



advise Australian organisations on how to mitigate emerging threats.
Internet subscribers in Australia
At the end of December 2014 there were:


more than 12.6 million internet subscribers in Australia



21 million subscribers to mobile services with an internet connection. 1

Cyber adversaries targeting Australia
What is a cyber adversary?
A cyber adversary is an individual or organisation (including an agency of a nation
state) that conducts cyber espionage, crime or attack.

Cyber adversaries are aggressive and persistent in their efforts to compromise Australian networks
and information. They are constantly improving their tradecraft in an attempt to defeat our network
defences and exploit new technologies.
Australia is an innovative country with a globally important resources sector. We are a regional leader
with global interests and important partnerships. This makes Australia a target-rich environment for
cyber adversaries.
There are a range of cyber adversaries motivated to target Australian networks.
Foreign state-sponsored adversaries
Foreign state-sponsored adversaries, including nation-states, seek economic, foreign policy, defence
and security information for strategic advantage. Such adversaries have traditionally possessed the
most advanced and sophisticated tools to conduct their activities, sometimes maintaining access to an
organisation’s network for years at a time to steal the information they require. These adversaries are
most frequently identified as Advanced Persistent Threats (APT).
Serious and Organised Criminals
Financially motivated criminals that exploit and access systems for financial gain are a substantial
threat to Australia. Transnational serious and organised cybercrime syndicates are of most concern,
specifically those which develop, share, sell and use sophisticated tools and techniques to access
networks and systems impacting Australia’s interests.

Issue motivated groups and individuals with personal grievances
Hacktivists and individuals causing nuisance, attempting to draw attention to themselves and their
causes, while usually less capable and sophisticated, are still able to cause disruption to Australian
government and businesses.

Cyber espionage
What is cyber espionage?
Cyber espionage is offensive activity designed to covertly collect information from a
user’s computer network for intelligence purposes.

Cyber espionage can have a significant impact on Australia’s national security and economic
prosperity. Foreign state-sponsored adversaries are targeting the networks of the Australian
government (including state and territory), industry and individuals to satisfy requirements for
economic, foreign policy, defence and security information, and gain advantage over Australia.
Australia is an attractive target for cyber espionage due to our:



resource wealth



range of commercial interests in Australia and internationally



expertise in certain fields of scientific research, manufacturing and technology



particular bilateral relationships and alliances



prominent role in the Indo-Pacific region.

Significant compromises can also cause economic harm, damage Australia’s reputation and
undermine international and domestic confidence in Australian network security.
An increasing number of countries are developing cyber espionage capabilities as this type of activity
offers high returns with relatively low cost and risk. Many countries will continue to deny they have a
cyber espionage program, however, as more cyber security firms publicise these activities, it is
becoming more difficult for adversaries to plausibly deny their capabilities.
The ACSC is aware that cyber espionage adversaries target industry networks in addition to
government networks to acquire desired information. Cyber adversaries will target the weakest link; if
the network security of their primary target is robust, they will move to secondary targeting of other
networks that may hold the same information but are easier to compromise.
The cyber espionage threat to Australia continues to evolve and expand. The ACSC is aware of
foreign state-sponsored adversaries using malicious software typically used by cybercriminals. In
some cases, their activity appears to be financially motivated cybercrime, making it difficult for the
victim to identify the true adversary, assess how much damage has resulted from the activity and
remediate the damage.
Cyber espionage does not always happen in isolation, with cyber espionage activities efforts
sometimes combined with other means of collection. As such, organisations need to work within their
own organisations to consider how cyber defences are integrated with other security measures as part
of a broader security posture.

Cyber espionage against Australian Government networks
The ACSC sees daily cyber espionage activity targeting Australian Government networks.
Australian Government agencies that have implemented ASD’s Top 4 Strategies to Mitigate Targeted
Cyber Intrusions and a selection of the remaining strategies based on internal risk assessments, are
improving their protection against cyber espionage activities.2 In addition, they are reducing the
consequences of these activities to Australia’s national security and economic prosperity.
While the overall number of cyber security incidents increased in 2014, the number of confirmed
significant compromises of federal Australian Government networks has decreased since 2012.
Improving network security forces cyber adversaries to either develop their capability or find alternative
targets.
Cyber espionage against Australian businesses
Australian businesses are increasingly being identified as targets of cyber espionage. The theft of
intellectual property or commercially sensitive information can:


seriously impair reputations, profitability and ability to compete in the global economy



limit business opportunities and reduce a company’s economic competitiveness



undermine a company’s business model and viability.

Targeting of systems of national interest and critical infrastructure
What are systems of national interest and critical infrastructure?
Systems of national interest are those systems that, if rendered unavailable or
otherwise compromised, could result in significant impacts on Australia’s economic
prosperity, international competitiveness, public safety, social wellbeing or national
defence and security.
Critical infrastructure is a subset of systems of national interest.

Australia’s systems of national interest and critical infrastructure are vulnerable to malicious cyber
activity. In 2014, CERT Australia responded to 11,073 cyber security incidents affecting Australian
businesses, 153 of which involved systems of national interest, critical infrastructure and government.
In 2014, the top five non-government sectors assisted by CERT Australia in relation to cyber security
incidents were: energy, banking and financial services, communications, defence industry, and
transport.
The ACSC relies primarily on voluntary self-reporting for information about cyber security incidents
affecting these networks. Some sectors have not yet invested heavily in cyber security, and therefore
may not understand the level of risk or potential economic harm to their business. Furthermore, some
businesses may be hesitant to report incidents due to the perceived impact or harm to their reputation.
The ACSC is working to forge stronger relationships with Australian businesses to better assess cyber
security practices and support improved cyber security.

Cyber attack
What is a cyber attack?
A cyber attack is a deliberate act through cyber space to manipulate, destruct, deny,
degrade or destroy computers or networks, or the information resident in them, with
the effect, in cyber space or the physical world, of seriously compromising national
security, stability or prosperity.

The ACSC treats cyber attacks as extremely serious and provocative events. Destructive cyber
attacks could be considered equivalent to an armed attack, and therefore, an act of war.
Australia has not yet been subjected to any activities that could be considered a cyber attack. A
destructive cyber attack against Australian networks or critical infrastructure – that would seriously
compromise national security, stability or prosperity – is unlikely outside a period of significant
heightened tension or escalation to conflict with another country.
Due to some overlap in the tools and techniques used in cyber attack and cyber espionage, efforts by
organisations to improve network resilience and better protect their networks from cyber espionage
will reduce the effectiveness of cyber attacks that target Australia.
As the technological and financial barriers to developing an effective attack capability diminish,
Australia faces the threat of a more diverse set of state and non-state-based cyber attacks in the
future. Although some non-state adversaries – such as terrorist and issue-motivated groups – have
expressed intent to conduct cyber attacks, they will probably continue to use disruption and vandalism
to gain publicity and further their causes.

Cybercrime
What is cybercrime?
In Australia, cybercrime refers to criminal acts involving the use of computers or
other ICT, or targeted against computers or other ICT.
Pure cybercrime: Crimes directed at computers or other ICT such as
unauthorised access to, modification of or impairment of electronic
communications or data.
Technology-enabled crime: Crimes where computers or ICT are an integral
part of an offence, such as online fraud, online identity theft and the online
distribution of child exploitation material.

Cybercrime affects individuals, businesses and governments. Australia’s relative wealth and high use
of technology – including social media, email and online banking and government services – make it
an attractive target for organised criminal syndicates. Misreporting and under-reporting of cybercrime
make it difficult to assess the prevalence and impact of offences.
Although it is difficult to establish an accurate figure for the cost of cybercrime in Australia, an
October 2013 industry estimate put the cost over the previous 12 months at A$1 billion.3 This is likely
to be an underestimation as it is based on adult individuals affected and does not include the cost to
business and government.

3 Symantec, 2013 Norton Report: Total Cost of Cybercrime in Australia amounts to A$1.06 billion, 13 October 2013,

symantec.com/about/news/resources/press_kits/detail.jsp?pkid=norton-report-2013

8 of 27

There are direct and indirect costs to cybercrime victims including:


damage to personal identity and reputation



loss of business or employment opportunities



impact on emotional and psychological wellbeing of individual victims.

The actual costs of cybercrime at the systemic level encompass the:


financial losses from fraud



costs of immediate responses



system remediation costs



flow-on costs to government support programs that assist cybercrime victims.

The complexity, sophistication and impact of cybercrime evolves as technology evolves, making it
difficult to track the technological advancements of cyber criminals. Furthermore, the complexity and
sophistication of malware used for cybercrime now rivals the capabilities of some state-sponsored
adversaries. As mentioned previously, foreign state-sponsored adversaries are using malicious
software typically used for financially motivated cybercrime to mask their identities and activities.
The ACSC assesses that cybercrime activity will continue to increase over the next five years.
Organised crime groups are using sophisticated malware to improve their success, and avoid
detection, in gaining unauthorised access to computer systems. Previously considered a niche
capability, malware used for cybercrime is now readily available through the online criminal
marketplace, often with ongoing technical support, making it accessible to people with minimal ICT
knowledge.

Disruption
The disruption of services or networks can affect Australian government and businesses. Hacktivists
and individuals causing nuisance favour activities such as denial of service, web defacement and
electronic graffiti to disrupt business and government activities. These activities are frequently
opportunistic in nature rather than targeted, taking advantage of a victim’s poor cyber security posture.
Issue-motivated groups can be particularly active around high profile events that attract significant
media attention, as these often result in the disruption gaining maximum visibility. The capabilities of
adversaries conducting these activities, while not as sophisticated as that of foreign state-sponsored
adversaries, can still be very effective in achieving their limited aims.
Hacktivism and denial of service activities are explained later in the report.

Cyber security incidents reported to ACSC agencies
What is a cyber security incident?
A cyber security incident is any activity that may threaten the security of a system or
its information. A compromise is an incident where the security of a system or its
information was successfully harmed. Examples of compromises include the
extraction of information from a computer network, defacement of a website, or
degradation in the reliability of an online service.

Attempts to compromise government, business and other networks of national importance are
regularly identified by, or reported to, the ACSC. Cyber adversaries are constantly adapting their
techniques in an attempt to breach security and compromise Australian networks.
ACSC partner agencies continued to compile separate statistics until the ACSC was officially opened
in November 2014. Consequently the following cyber security incident response statistics for 2014
have been presented separately in this publication.
ASD is predominantly responsible for responding to cyber security incidents involving Australian
Government networks and other networks of national importance; consequently, ASD statistics may
reflect this bias. The 2014 ASD statistics reflect cyber security incidents that were triaged through the
former Cyber Security Operations Centre.

CERT Australia is predominantly responsible for responding to cyber security incidents involving
Australian businesses and systems of national interest, including critical infrastructure operators;
CERT Australia statistics may reflect this bias.

Activity Targeting Australian Networks
Cyber intrusions
What is a cyber intrusion?
A cyber intrusion, also referred to as unauthorised access or hacking, occurs when
someone gains access to a computer or device without the owner’s permission.

Foreign state-sponsored actors conduct targeted cyber intrusions, seeking information about
Australia’s business dealings, intellectual property, scientific data and government policy decisions.
These activities can give them a diplomatic, political, military or economic advantage over Australia.
Adversaries that conduct intrusions for cybercrime purposes gain unauthorised access to computers,
networks and devices to illicitly obtain funds. This can involve extortion as well as extracting
usernames, passwords and other information to undertake theft and fraud.
Cyber adversaries exploit security vulnerabilities in a targeted computer or network to gain access,
and frequently use social engineering techniques such as carefully crafted emails to entice a user to
click on a link or open an attachment. These techniques, also known as spear phishing, remained a
prevalent method used to target Australian organisations in cyber intrusions during 2014. The
sophistication of these emails continues to grow, making them more difficult to detect.

Case study: Spear phishing
Organisations with poor cyber security are particularly susceptible to compromises
resulting from socially engineered emails.
An employee at an Australian business received an email that appeared to have
been sent from another business with which they dealt regularly. However, the email
had been sent from an unfamiliar webmail account. Although the recipient of the
email was suspicious and attempted to check the legitimacy of the email, they
opened an email attachment without waiting for a response.
The attachment was an executable (.exe) file masked as a MS Excel file.
Consequently, the network was compromised, and it is believed that intellectual
property, personnel records, business development proposals and project
information may have been stolen.
The compromise could have been prevented if application whitelisting had been
adequately implemented on the network, including on the laptop that the employee
was using when the attachment was opened.

Remote Access Tools
A Remote Access Tool (RAT) is an administration tool that allows someone to access a computer from
a remote location. While RATs have legitimate purposes, they can also be associated with malicious
activity. In 2014, the ACSC observed RATs being used in targeted cyber intrusions.
Case study: RAT
In 2014, the ACSC received a report from an Australian state government agency
that had discovered a compromise of one of its servers when performing an annual
penetration test.
An ACSC investigation confirmed the presence of Java ServerPage RAT (jRAT) on
four servers. This had allowed remote administrator-level access to the servers and
confidential files stored on them. The default administrator credentials had not been
changed after a recent software upgrade. To remediate, the servers were removed
from the network and rebuilt.

Watering-hole techniques
What is a watering-hole?
A watering-hole is a compromised legitimate website, frequented by a cyber
adversary’s intended targets. Malware placed on the website is intended to
compromise the computers of visitors to the site.

The use of watering-hole techniques by cyber adversaries targeting Australian networks continues to
grow. Taking full advantage of a user’s trust in a website, the watering-hole technique provides an
effective method for exploitation.
In 2014, the ACSC noted incidents involving watering-hole exploitation of websites regularly visited by
Australian government employees. These incidents were mitigated successfully, as the malware was
attempting to exploit a vulnerability to which the visitor was not exposed. It is important to understand
however that this type of activity is no longer opportunistic; it is now an activity targeting Australian
government and business.
During 2014, CERT Australia handled more than 8,100 incidents involving compromised websites.
Websites can often be compromised due to poor maintenance or security configuration. Cyber
adversaries often target these websites to distribute malware, host phishing websites or build denial of
service botnets.
While these issues are relatively easy to remedy from a technical perspective, the potential impact to
the website owner and visitors can be significant. In many cases, the owner of the website was not
aware of the compromise until they were notified or the website had been blacklisted by a security
organisation. A blacklisted website can experience a significant drop in regular traffic and therefore a
drop in revenue.
Case study: Watering-hole
In October 2014, CERT Australia issued an advisory warning of watering-hole
activity specifically targeting organisations in the energy sector. The advisory listed
websites that had likely been compromised, and encouraged clients to report any
suspicious activity. CERT Australia clients were able to use the information provided
to successfully detect and block communications to watering-hole sites.

Malware
What is malware?
Malware is MALicious softWARE designed to facilitate unauthorised access to a
system, or cause damage or disruption to a system.
In 2014, malware, including ransomware, was the predominant cybercrime threat in Australia. It is a
persistent threat because new malware types are developed and released regularly, and antivirus
software cannot detect all new variants. Some malware remains dormant on a system for a period of
time, circumventing security and running undetected until achieving its objectives.
The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) operates the Australian Internet Security
Initiative (AISI) program. The AISI provides participants with daily notifications of IP addresses on their
networks observed as potentially vulnerable to malicious exploits or infected by malware. 4
Between 17 October 2014 and 14 January 2015, the AISI reported over 15,000 malware compromises
daily to Australian Internet Service Providers (ISPs) for them to action.5
Data collected by the AISI between April and December 2014 indicates the three malware variants
most frequently detected on Australian IP ranges were:


Zeus



ZeroAccess



Conficker.

Zeus
Discovered in July 2007, Zeus is a Trojan that steals banking details through keylogging and
form-grabbing. It is spread through drive-by downloads and socially engineered emails. Zeus
GameOver is a variant of this Trojan.
In June 2014, approximately 1 million computers worldwide were thought to be infected with Zeus
GameOver, causing an estimated loss of US$100m.
Case Study: Zeus GameOver takedown
In 2014, the AFP assisted in operational activity led by the US Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI), which resulted in the takedown of Zeus GameOver infrastructure.
The US obtained civil and criminal orders authorising measures to sever
communication between the infected computers and redirect them from criminal
servers to government controlled servers. Additionally, these orders authorised the
FBI to identify victim IP addresses and provide this victim information to international
CERTs, ISPs and other private sector organisations to assist victims in removing the
malware from their computers.
Evgeniy Bogachev, the leader of a cybercrime group based in Russia and the
Ukraine, was responsible for developing and operating Zeus GameOver, as well as
a type of ransomware named CryptoLocker.

Security/Australian-Internet-Security-Initiative/australian-internet-security-initiative

14 of 27

Case Study: Zeus GameOver takedown (continued) The takedown of Zeus
GameOver demonstrates that international collaboration across government and
industry can successfully disrupt serious and organised cybercrime activity.6
ZeroAccess
ZeroAccess is another type of malware used for financially motivated cybercrime. ZeroAccess causes
computers that are infected to generate ‘clicks’ on advertisements to receive commission from the
advertising companies (also known as ‘click fraud’). These companies are not usually aware that the
click activities are not legitimate. Infection by this malware is typically through drive-by downloads and
socially-engineered emails. While ZeroAccess is currently used for click fraud and bitcoin mining, the
threat arises from its ability to undertake any activity desired by its controller. The large network of
ZeroAccess botnets can be used as the delivery mechanism for any other desired activities that may
pose significant risks to Australian interests.

Case Study: ZeroAccess
ZeroAccess is highly commercialised and highly profitable malware with a ‘pay-perinstall’ incentive that has contributed to its growth. The amount paid is based on the
country in which the installation occurs, with installations on Australian computers
earning US$75. According to AISI data, ZeroAccess malware compromised an
average of 4,000 devices per day between October and December 2014.
ZeroAccess targets a range of devices, and uses an advanced method of selfprotection by disabling any security tool trying to detect and remove it. In 2014, it
affected Point of Sale systems in 60 Australian Pizza Hut outlets. During these
incidents, stores were unable to serve customers for up to two hours. In some cases,
stores were offline for an entire day while computers were re-imaged.
Despite law enforcement interdiction, ZeroAccess remains resilient to disruption due
to the complexity of its network. It continues to be a threat in Australia, through
bitcoin mining and click fraud, and it has the potential to be used for other types of
cybercrime activity.7 8 9
Conficker
First detected in November 2008, Conficker is a worm that targets Microsoft Windows operating
systems, using vulnerabilities to gain privileged access to a network. Although security patches to
address these vulnerabilities have existed for years, many computers remain vulnerable and infected.

Ransomware
What is ransomware?
Ransomware refers to extortion through the use of malware that typically locks a
computer’s content and requires victims to pay a ransom to regain access. It can
also be accompanied by a threat that the computer has been locked as a result of
illegal or questionable conduct by the victim.

Ransomware campaigns against computers in Australia and overseas are increasing. There are a
variety of campaign methodologies and themes, but most types of ransomware encrypt files on a
computer so that they cannot be accessed until a ransom has been paid. Some types of ransomware
will also activate the webcam to try to convince the user that their computer is under real-time
surveillance. This may be reinforced by an accompanying message (frequently purporting to be from a
law enforcement or government agency) claiming that the computer has been used for illegal activity
and demanding payment of a fine.
In July 2014, a number of ACSC partner agencies issued alerts notifying their customers of an
aggressive encrypting ransomware campaign. The campaign was targeting government and nongovernment organisations through phishing emails with links to a website hosting a .zip file containing
malicious executable content.
In separate activity during 2014, it was discovered that CryptoWall 2.0 ransomware was using
‘malvertising’ to infect computers visiting popular Australian websites. These malvertisements
exploited Adobe Flash vulnerabilities in web browsers to covertly install CryptoWall 2.0 on the
computers of visitors to these websites. The ransomware then encrypted the hard drive and disabled
access until the victim paid a fee for the decryption key.10 It is important to note that the websites
themselves were not compromised. Rather, it was the advertising network connected to the websites
which did not have sufficient screening detection against advertisements originating from malicious
sources.
Many large organisations and some members of the community were able to remove the ransomware
infections by restoring computers and data from a backup. However, organisations that had not
performed a recent backup experienced much greater disruption (the ACSC was aware of one
organisation that had not performed a network backup in the previous 12 months). Some
organisations found that, despite restoration from backup, roaming profiles were continuing to execute
the malware and re-compromising their networks.

16 of 27

Case study: TorrentLocker
TorrentLocker was first identified as a new variant of ransomware in February 2014.
Masquerading as CryptoLocker, it initially only targeted Australia but by the end of
the year had been observed targeting a total of 13 countries. Australian victims
received a ransom message specifying the ransom fee, and demanding that they
purchase bitcoins from specified Australian websites and send the payment to the
address provided. The ransom amount ranged from A$500 to A$600.
TorrentLocker used the branding of trusted and well-known Australian corporations
as part of its social engineering techniques.
Misappropriation of business names and counterfeiting of legitimate brands harms
the reputation of these businesses and impacts customer loyalty. Businesses need
to invest time and resources to inform customers about scams that exploit their
identity, and then incur further costs to improve security.
One prominent Australian corporate victim, whose brand has been exploited,
estimates that its response to TorrentLocker, including monitoring, takedown actions
against malicious domains, and brand protection, has so far cost A$185,000.
The ACC estimated in December 2014, that approximately 16,000 victims had been
affected and paid a cumulative ransom of approximately A$8 million. The numbers of
those systems that were infected without a ransom being paid are much higher, and
a cost may be associated with each infection for the subsequent system repairs.11 12

Distributed Denial of Service
What is a Denial of Service (DoS)?
A DoS is an attempt by a cyber adversary to prevent legitimate access to online
services (typically a website), by consuming the amount of available bandwidth or
the processing capacity of the computer hosting the online service. A DoS can also
occur unintentionally through misconfiguration or a sudden and unexpected surge in
legitimate usage. When multiple computers are used to conduct these activities,
such as through the use of a botnet, it is referred to as Distributed Denial of Service
(DDoS).

The impact of DDoS activities can be amplified when they are bounced off other internet services.
Cyber adversaries are now using infrastructure that can turn small requests into large responses
(some up to 500 times larger), meaning that even relatively small botnets can cause significant
problems for Australian organisations.
The number of DDoS activities identified by or reported to the ACSC during 2014 remained steady
compared to 2013. The ACSC assesses that DDoS activities will remain a threat to Australian
networks and organisations, particularly from issue-motivated groups and individuals demanding
attention. Cyber adversaries are increasingly finding ways to monetise activities that were previously
considered to be solely nuisance value.

17 of 27

A growing trend observed by the ACSC is DDoS extortion, where an adversary will threaten to launch
DDoS activity against an organisation unless a fee is paid. These threats can be accompanied by a
small-scale DDoS activity to demonstrate intent.
The ACSC advises Australian organisations not to respond to threats. There is no way to determine if
the threat is credible, or to guarantee that the DDoS will not occur if the fee is paid.
The ACSC has recently updated its advice on DDoS, including information on preparing for and
responding to such activities, see asd.gov.au/publications/protect/preparing-for-responding-to-ddosactivities.htm.

Case study: DDoS
A major Australian organisation was the victim of a sustained DDoS targeting its
main website. An issue-motivated group purporting to oppose the work of this
organisation claimed responsibility for the activity. The group had exploited poorly
configured domain name system (DNS) infrastructure to conduct the activity.
CERT Australia provided advice to the organisation on how to protect itself from a
DDoS activity, and analysed logs of the activity. As a result of the analysis, CERT
Australia identified DNS servers utilised in the activity, and contacted the system
owners to help them improve the configuration so that those systems would not be
used in further DDoS activity.

Hacktivism
What is hacktivism?
Malicious cyber activity conducted by issue-motivated groups or individuals for the
purpose of promoting a particular cause or targeting a particular person or
organisation associated with an issue or cause.

Another type of malicious activity occasionally observed in Australia is issue-motivated hacking, also
referred to as hacktivism. Hacktivists use cyberspace to sustain political debate and engage in protest.
This can include electronic graffiti such as offensive propaganda postings on social media platforms
and defacement of web pages, unauthorised computer intrusions and other acts of digital tampering.
This type of activity can cause disruption for affected organisations.
Over the past two years, the AFP has disrupted activities and arrested individuals involved in the
compromise and defacement of government websites and theft of personal and corporate data
holdings. While cyber adversaries can operate from anywhere, arrests can be a significant deterrent to
hackers in Australia.

Mitigation advice
Mitigating cyber intrusions
Key publications such as the Australian Government Information Security Manual (ISM) and the
Strategies to Mitigate Targeted Cyber Intrusions are regularly updated to reflect the increasing
sophistication of cyber adversaries targeting Australian networks. When implemented as a package,
the Top 4 Strategies to Mitigate Targeted Cyber Intrusions can mitigate at least 85% of targeted cyber
intrusions responded to by the ACSC. See both asd.gov.au/infosec/ism/index.htm and
asd.gov.au/infosec/mitigationstrategies.htm.

Mitigating watering-hole techniques
Education will not necessarily prevent a user from visiting a legitimate website that has been
temporarily compromised as part of a watering-hole attack. Visiting such a website might compromise
a user’s computer without any obvious indications of the compromise.
It is essential that organisations implement technical measures to defend against this type of activity.
In addition to implementing the Top 4 Strategies to Mitigate Targeted Cyber Intrusions, organisations
should consider introducing additional technical measures such as:


Strategy 5: User application configuration hardening



Strategy 6: Automated dynamic analysis



Strategy 7: Operating system generic exploit mitigation



Strategy 18: Web content filtering.

Organisations should also ensure that their own websites and web applications cannot be
compromised and used as watering-holes.
Mitigation strategies for malware
The ACSC recommends Australian government and businesses defend against malware infections by
implementing the Strategies to Mitigate Targeted Cyber Intrusions, with particular attention to the Top
4 strategies. In addition:


educating staff about cyber security can assist in preventing and identifying an initial
system infection



using up-to-date antivirus software configured to perform internet-based reputation
checking can help detect malware if it does make its way onto the system



disabling AutoRun and AutoPlay features may help to prevent malware from propagating
through a network via removable media.

Mitigation strategies for ransomware
Avoid paying a ransom if you experience this type of infection, as this perpetuates the incentive for the
cyber adversary to continue their activities. Data loss can be minimised by taking the appropriate
steps to prevent this type of infection from occurring in the first place.
The ACSC recommends the following to avoid falling victim to ransomware:


implement the Top 4 Strategies to Mitigate Targeted Cyber Intrusions



block executable files from entering a corporate network through email or web downloads



inspect compressed file formats for executable content



create regular offline backups, including backups of peripheral data storage devices.

If you do experience a cyber security incident involving encrypting ransomware, the ACSC offers the
following remediation advice:


identify any compromised workstations and remove them from the network



block known indicators to prevent an immediate re-compromise, check for profile-resident
malware and clean profiles



restore from backup.

Key Cyber Security Alerts
Heartbleed
In April 2014, Heartbleed, a serious vulnerability in OpenSSL’s implementation of the TLS/SSL
Heartbeat extension, was publicly disclosed. OpenSSL is commonly used in Apache software running
on Linux/Unix web servers, and other Linux/Unix services. Exploitation of this vulnerability causes the
memory contents to leak, allowing a cyber adversary to gain access to private keys, usernames,
passwords and protected content that could facilitate further cyber activities. The vulnerability also
allows cyber adversaries to repeatedly access the data by sending a series of commands to
vulnerable servers. Within four hours of the vulnerability becoming public, adversaries were taking full
advantage of it, much faster than vendors were able to create and release patches.
OpenSSL released a patch for the Heartbleed vulnerability the day it was publicly disclosed.
Organisations using a vulnerable version of OpenSSL were advised to upgrade their OpenSSL, install
a new certificate and revoke old certificates.
A problem associated with the vulnerability was that users of affected web servers had to wait for
instructions from the organisations prior to changing their passwords. Changing passwords before the
servers were patched and old certificate revoked would still expose the users to exploitation.
Communicating this message and ensuring that users adhered to the specific instructions presented a
challenge.
In April 2015, 12 months after Heartbleed was first publicised, it was revealed that an estimated 84%
of Australian businesses had yet to fully remediate this vulnerability.13
The ACSC urges Australian organisations to check that they are not affected by Heartbleed, and take
appropriate action as required.

Case study: Heartbleed
After Heartbleed was publicised, the ACSC saw numerous adversaries conduct
testing against a range of systems in Australia.
During an investigation by the AFP in May 2014, analysis of an alleged offender’s
computer showed that they made over 360 attempts to access data exploiting
Heartbleed. The offender targeted remote access servers in an effort to extract
usernames and passwords, in an attempt to gain access to more sensitive data.
Victims that had implemented intrusion detection/prevention systems were able to
mitigate the activity. The alleged offender was charged with several counts of
attempted unauthorised access to twelve Australian servers.

Bash / Shellshock
In September 2014, an extreme risk vulnerability in the Bash shell was made public. Bash is the
default shell on Linux and Apple OS X systems used to execute command lines and scripts. It is
widely present in the firmware of common devices such as routers and wireless access points. The
vulnerability affects UNIX based platforms, including Apple Mac. This vulnerability can be exploited to
remotely execute arbitrary code, potentially permitting full system control for cyber adversaries. The
vulnerability allows malicious commands to be included, which can then download and run malicious
programs.
Patches for this vulnerability are available for download; however, this vulnerability may still be present
in third party applications and programs that are embedded in the systems. Vendors must first
upgrade the firmware of their appliances and programs for the systems to be considered fully patched.

End of Support for Windows XP and MS Office 2003
In April 2014, Microsoft ended support for Windows XP and Microsoft Office 2003. Organisations still
using this software are urged to review the threat and risk assessments for their ICT environments and
implement additional controls to reduce their risk exposure.
The ACSC has produced tailored advice for organisations using Windows XP and MS Office 2003,
highlighting which Strategies to Mitigate Targeted Cyber Intrusions can offer additional security
improvements until they upgrade their standard operating environment. This advice is available at
asd.gov.au/publications/protect/win_xp_office_2003_end_support.htm.

Microsoft Active Directory Group Policy Preferences Vulnerability
In July 2014, the ACSC notified Australian Government customers of a vulnerability associated with
Microsoft Active Directory Group Policy (CVE-2014-1812).
Several months prior to this, Microsoft had released a patch to prevent easy privilege escalation by a
cyber adversary. The patch prevented a cyber adversary from creating new local accounts with
passwords but did not remove existing vulnerable local accounts from systems or existing group
policies.
If the vulnerability is not fully mitigated, a cyber adversary can move laterally across a network. They
are able to obtain clear text credentials of local administrator accounts. As such, this vulnerability
presents a high level of risk for Australian Government agencies in particular, and other organisations
valuable to cyber adversaries.
The ACSC recommends organisations ensure that this vulnerability is patched, or that this feature not
be used to store credentials in group policy preferences.

Cloud Computing Security
What is cloud computing?
Cloud computing is a service model that enables network access to a shared pool of
computing resources such as data storage, servers, software applications and other
ICT services.
There are three types of cloud service offerings: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS);
Platform as a Service (PaaS); Software as a Service (SaaS). Any of these services
can be provided through community, hybrid, private or public cloud models.14

Cloud computing can be a cost-effective option for providing information technology services,
delivering a superior service and greater security in some circumstances. Many Australian public and
private sector organisations are already using cloud services to enable their business, a trend that is
certain to continue.
Cloud services are subject to similar threat vectors as traditional ICT service models, and can
introduce additional cyber security threats to an organisation’s information. In June 2014, a company
was put out of business when a cyber adversary used the company’s legitimate cloud login credentials
to irretrievably delete company data from the Cloud Service Provider (CSP).15
It is essential that organisations conduct comprehensive risk assessments to identify and manage
jurisdictional, governance, privacy, technical and security risks. Some points to consider include but
are not limited to:


Where your data may reside (onshore versus offshore), and therefore whether that data is
subject to a foreign government’s lawful access, as well as jurisdictional laws. Foreignowned CSPs operating in Australia may also be subject to a foreign government’s lawful
access. Major cloud service providers acknowledge that they have to disclose customer
data in response to legally binding requests, and may not be able to notify customers
beforehand.



Storing information in multiple disparate locations and allowing more people to access it
can increase the opportunities for information and networks to be compromised.



The multi-tenancy nature of cloud computing (ie hosting multiple customers on the same
infrastructure), increases the likelihood of unauthorised access or network compromise.
Proof-of-concept exploits have been developed to circumvent virtualisation software that
underpins cloud computing technologies.



Some security measures that were previously visible to and controlled by an organisation
will become the responsibility of the CSP. However, organisations must still consider the
security of virtualised environments, including implementation of the Top 4 Strategies to
Mitigate Targeted Cyber Intrusions.

Mitigation strategies for risks associated with cloud computing
Although mitigating the risks associated with cloud computing is a responsibility shared between the
tenant and the CSP, organisations are ultimately responsible for protecting their information. While
cloud computing may be a daunting prospect for some organisations, many of the risks can be
mitigated through mechanisms such as the contract with the CSP and specific security measures.
The ACSC has updated its cloud computing security advice for both tenants and CSPs, including
identified risks and mitigation advice for managing these risks. The Australian Government ISM has
also been updated to include information and controls on Outsourced Cloud Services. These
publications are complemented by ASD’s new Certified Cloud Services List, a list of CSPs that have
been assessed and certified against security and governance requirements.
Refer to the following for further information about cloud computing:

Finance website at finance.gov.au/cloud/.

Incident Reporting
Australian organisations are urged to report cyber security incidents to the ACSC by following the links
on the ACSC website acsc.gov.au. Australian government agencies and businesses reporting cyber
security incidents to the ACSC can request advice and assistance on how to remediate these
incidents.
The ACSC uses cyber security incident reports as the basis for identifying and responding to cyber
security incidents across Australia. These reports can also be used to develop new policies,
procedures, techniques and training measures to prevent the recurrence of similar cyber security
incidents.
Organisations that have outsourced ICT services may request that their service provider report cyber
security incidents to the ACSC. This could be specified in either a memorandum of understanding or
as part of the service contract. In these cases, it is recommended the service provider inform the
organisation’s IT Security Advisor about any reporting of cyber security incidents to the ACSC.
ACORN is the primary method for Australians to report cybercrime. ACORN is a national policing
initiative of the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments and has been designed to make it
easier for Australians to recognise, report and avoid common types of cybercrime. Visit the ACORN
website at acorn.gov.au.
In January 2015, the ACSC released a video, Recognise. Report. to encourage reporting of cyber
security incidents. This video may assist organisations in reinforcing important cyber security
messages to staff. Visit the ACSC website to watch the video.

Outlook
The ever-changing nature of technology offers significant opportunities and challenges for Australia’s
cyber security. Robust cyber defences will continue to allow a high degree of confidence in network
and information security. However, the ability of cyber adversaries to create, identify and exploit
vulnerabilities in networks and ICT-enabled capabilities will continue to provide opportunities to take
advantage of networks. Through support and collaboration, cyber defenders can make it more difficult
for adversaries to succeed.

Trends for 2015 and beyond
While the ACSC is still developing a detailed understanding of the full spectrum of threats to Australian
networks, we predict the following trends to manifest globally in the near future:


The number of state and cyber criminals with capability will increase.



Due to the limited number of quality software developers, cybercrime-as-a-service is likely
to increase, reducing the barriers for entry for cybercriminals.



The sophistication of the current cyber adversaries will increase, making detection and
response more difficult.



Spear phishing will continue to be popular with adversaries, and the use of watering-hole
techniques will increase.



Ransomware will continue to be prominent.



There will be an increase in the number of cyber adversaries with a destructive capability
and, possibly, the number of incidents with a destructive element.



There will be an increase in electronic graffiti, such as web defacements and social media
hijacking, which is designed to grab a headline.

Ensuring a resilient, cyber secure Australia requires the expertise and collective capabilities of the
ACSC, government and industry network owners, operators and users, academia and our
international partners.
In our approach to cyber security, Australia must remain vigilant, proactive and resourced to meet the
challenges of a complex cyber environment.
Cyber security efforts should aim to make Australia a harder target and thereby increase the trust and
confidence of all Australians to engage in the benefits the internet brings. Effective cyber security
requires a partnership between government and the private sector, with organisations and their users
taking greater responsibility for the security of their networks and information.

Denial of Service (DoS)

Definition
Application whitelisting is one of the top four strategies in ASD’s
Strategies to Mitigate Targeted Cyber Intrusions. It is designed to
protect against unauthorised and malicious programs executing on a
computer. It aims to ensure that only specifically selected programs
and software libraries (DLLs) can be executed, while all others are
prevented from executing.
A collection of infected computers remotely controlled by a cyber
adversary to conduct malicious activities without the user's
knowledge, such as to send spam, spread malware, conduct denial
of service activities and steal data.
A service model that enables network access to a shared pool of
computing resources such as data storage, servers, software
applications and services.
A type of file format which compresses data to consume less storage
space and network bandwidth. Examples of compressed file formats
include .zip files, .rar files and .jar files.
The physical facilities, supply chains, information technologies and
communications networks which if destroyed, degraded or rendered
unavailable, damage national security, or the social or economic
wellbeing of the nation.
An individual or organisation (including an agency of a nation state)
that conducts cyber espionage, crime or attack.
Includes deliberate acts through cyber space to manipulate, destruct,
deny, degrade or destroy computers or networks, or the information
resident in them, with the effect, in cyber space or the physical world,
of seriously compromising national security, stability or prosperity.
Offensive activity designed to covertly collect information from a
user’s computer network for intelligence purposes.
Occurs when someone gains access to a computer or device without
the owner’s permission. Also referred to as unauthorised access or
hacking.
An occurrence or activity that may threaten the confidentiality,
integrity or availability of a system or the information stored,
processed or communicated by it. A compromise is an incident where
the security of a system or its information was successfully harmed.
Criminal acts involving the use of computers or other ICT, or targeted
against computers or other ICT.
 Pure cybercrime: Crimes directed at computing or other ICT such
as unauthorised access to, modification of or impairment of
electronic communications or data.
 Technology-enabled crime: Crimes where computers or ICT are an
integral part of an offence, such as online fraud, online identity theft
and the online distribution of child exploitation material.
An attempt by a cyber adversary to prevent legitimate access to
online services (typically a website), by consuming the amount of
available bandwidth or the processing capacity of the computer
hosting the online service. A DoS can also occur unintentionally
through misconfiguration or a sudden and unexpected surge in
legitimate usage. When multiple computers are used to conduct these
activities, such as through the use of a botnet, it is referred to as
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS).

Definition
Occurs when a user visits a malicious website or a legitimate
website that has been compromised, involving malicious software
designed to automatically run on the user's computer typically
without requiring any additional user interaction.
A piece of software, a chunk of data, or sequence of commands that
takes advantage of a bug, glitch or vulnerability in order to cause
unintended or unanticipated behaviour to occur on computer
software, hardware, or something electronic (usually computerised).
This frequently includes such actions as gaining control of a computer
system, allowing privilege escalation or a denial-of-service attack.
A more advanced type of keylogging where the data is captured from
browser forms, before data is sent over the internet to a secure
server. This method is able to acquire data regardless of input method
(i.e. through the use of virtual keyboard, auto-fill or copy and paste).
It only records data specified by the cyber adversary, and logs which
website data origin, such as IP address and URL.
Malicious cyber activity conducted by issue-motivated groups or
individuals for the purpose of promoting a particular cause or
targeting a particular person or organisation associated with an issue
or cause.
A coalition of communities or individuals, often loosely formed, that is
primarily drawn around a common interest.
Software on a system that records what a user types on their
keyboard or the use of their mouse.
MALicious softWARE designed to facilitate unauthorised access to a
system, or cause damage or disruption to a system.
A drive-by download primarily affecting legitimate websites, where
the malicious software is delivered to the user via an advertisement.
Extortion through the use of malware that typically locks a computer’s
content and requires victims to pay a ransom to regain access. It can
also be accompanied by a threat that the computer has been locked
as a result of illegal or questionable conduct by the victim.
Storage media that can be easily removed from a system and is
designed for removal, for example USB flash drives or optical media.
Manipulating a person into performing actions or divulging sensitive
information. Cyber adversaries use a wide variety of tools such as
email and social media to conduct social engineering against target
personnel.
An adversary with a full range of access, expertise and operational
reach. Sophisticated state-sponsored adversaries fully integrate
cyber, information operations programs and traditional signals and
human intelligence collection capabilities.
Also referred to as socially-engineered emails, spear phishing emails
are constructed to target specific people, often containing a hyperlink
or an attachment which, when clicked on or opened, attempts to
download malicious code to a workstation to enable a cyber
adversary to conduct further malicious activities. The email is crafted
to look like a legitimate email from a legitimate sender. Targeted
communication (usually email) to members of an organisation as a
group or as an individual in order to acquire sensitive information or
infect with malware.
