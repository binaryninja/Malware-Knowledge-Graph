investigated activities associated with the BRONZE BUTLER (also known as Tick)
threat group, which likely originates in the People's Republic of China (PRC).
BRONZE BUTLER's operations suggest a long-standing intent to exﬁltrate
intellectual property and other conﬁdential data from Japanese organizations.
Intrusions observed by CTU™ researchers indicate a focus on networks involved
in critical infrastructure, heavy industry, manufacturing, and international
relations.
CTU researchers divided the threat intelligence about this threat group into
two sections: strategic and tactical. Executives can use the strategic assessment
of the ongoing threat to determine how to reduce risk to their organization's
mission and critical assets. Computer network defenders can use the tactical
information gathered from incident response investigations and research to
reduce the time and effort associated with responding to the threat group's
activities.

Key points
Analysis of BRONZE BUTLER's operations, targeting, and capability led CTU
researchers to assess that it is likely that the group is located in the PRC.
The group has used spearphishing, strategic web compromises (SWCs),
and an exploit of a zero-day vulnerability to compromise targeted systems.
After exﬁltrating targeted data from a network, BRONZE BUTLER typically
deletes evidence of its activities. However, it maintains access to
compromised environments when possible, periodically revisiting
compromised sites to identify new opportunities for data exﬁltration.

The threat actors seemingly have the capability to develop and deploy
their own proprietary malware tools. The group's command and control
(C2) protocols are encrypted, presenting challenges for network defenders
and incident responders.

Strategic threat intelligence
Analysis of a threat group's targeting, origin, and competencies can determine
which organizations could be at risk. This information can help organizations
make strategic defensive decisions regarding this threat.

Intent
CTU analysis indicates that BRONZE BUTLER primarily targets organizations
located in Japan. The threat group has sought unauthorized access to
networks of organizations associated with critical infrastructure, heavy industry,
manufacturing, and international relations. Secureworks analysts have observed
BRONZE BUTLER exﬁltrating the following categories of data:
Intellectual property related to technology and development
Product speciﬁcation
Sensitive business and sales-related information
Network and system conﬁguration ﬁles
Email messages and meeting minutes
The focus on intellectual property, product details, and corporate information
suggests that the group seeks information that they believe might be of value
PDF generated automatically by the PDFmyURL HTML to PDF API

to competing organizations. The diverse targeting suggests that BRONZE
BUTLER may be tasked by multiple teams or organizations with varying
priorities.

Attribution
The following characteristics led CTU researchers to assess that it is likely that
BRONZE BUTLER originates in the PRC:
Use of T-SMB Scan tools published on a Chinese developer's website
Chinese characters in the installation service name of an early version of
the xxmm backdoor
Documented links between BRONZE BUTLER's Daserf tool and the PRCbased NCPH hacking group, and a decrease in BRONZE BUTLER activity
during PRC national holidays
PRC-based cyberespionage groups have historically sought intellectual property
and economic intelligence from competing economies to deliver information
which can provide a competitive advantage domestically. The demand for this
type of intelligence gathering could be inﬂuenced by China’s ambitious
economic growth goals.

Capability
BRONZE BUTLER has used a broad range of publicly available (Mimikatz and
gsecdump) and proprietary (Daserf and Datper) tools. It appears to have been
PDF generated automatically by the PDFmyURL HTML to PDF API

sufﬁciently resourced to continuously develop and replace its proprietary tools
over a long period of time. The threat actors developed remote access tools
and malware that generate and use encrypted C2 communication, presumably
to complicate detection and mitigation. The threat actors are also ﬂuent in
Japanese, crafting phishing emails in native Japanese and operating
successfully within a Japanese-language environment.
CTU analysis indicates that BRONZE BUTLER purchases a subset of its C2
infrastructure. A large percentage of this infrastructure is hosted in Japan,
possibly to avoid scrutiny from security agencies that monitor international
communications. The group periodically changes the C2 IP addresses and
domains for each compromised network, which can limit the effectiveness of
blacklisting the group's infrastructure. The group also supplements its
operational infrastructure with access to compromised websites. The breadth
and complexity of BRONZE BUTLER's operational infrastructure suggests that
the group may have access to a dedicated infrastructure acquisition function.
The group has demonstrated the ability to identify a signiﬁcant zero-day
vulnerability within a popular Japanese corporate tool and then use scan-andexploit techniques to indiscriminately compromise Japanese Internet-facing
enterprise systems. The threat actors appear to use these initial footholds to
select organizations of interest for further compromise. The group is attentive
to changes in compromised networks and proactively attempts to avoid scrutiny
from network defenders by modifying tools and methods. It has remained
undetected in several compromised networks for up to ﬁve years.

Tactical threat intelligence
Incident response engagements have given CTU researchers insight into the
tools and tactics that BRONZE BUTLER employs during intrusions.

Tools
CTU researchers have observed BRONZE BUTLER leveraging the following tools
that appear to be exclusive to the group. Figure 1 shows the threat group's
use of some proprietary tools between 2012 and 2017.

Daserf — This backdoor has the functionality of a remote shell and can be
used to execute commands, upload and download data, capture
screenshots, and log keystrokes. It uses RC4 encryption and custom
PDF generated automatically by the PDFmyURL HTML to PDF API

Base64 encoding to obfuscate HTTP trafﬁc. CTU researchers identiﬁed two
versions of Daserf written in Visual C and Delphi. Analysis of the compile
timestamps suggest that Delphi version is the successor to the Visual C
version. CTU analysis suggests that the following registry entry is an
indication of a Delphi-based Daserf infection:
Key: HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer
Value: MMID = <random hex string>
Datper — BRONZE BUTLER likely created this Delphi-coded RAT to replace
Daserf. Datper uses an RC4-encrypted conﬁguration to obfuscate HTTP
trafﬁc.
xxmm (also known as Minzen) — This RAT and likely successor to Daserf
AES-encrypts HTTP communications using a one-time encryption key. As of
this publication, BRONZE BUTLER demonstrates a preference for
concurrently using Datper and xxmm in its operations. CTU researchers
identiﬁed an xxmm builder for xxmm (see Figure 2), which suggests that
the threat actors customize the xxmm malware settings based on the
target.

xxmm downloader (also known as KVNDM) — This simple downloader's
code is similar to the main xxmm payload.
Gofarer — This downloader uses the “Mozilla/4.0+
(compatible;+MSIE+8.0;+Windows+NT+6.1;+Trident/4.0;” User-Agent in its HTTP
communication (see Figure 3).

MSGet — This persistent downloader uses a dead-drop resolver (DDR) to
download and execute another malicious payload. MSGet typically
downloads encoded binaries from hard-coded URLs. After decoding,
MSGet saves the binary as %TEMP%\ms<hex string>.exe and executes it.
DGet — This simple downloader (see Figure 4) is similar to the wget web
server retrieval tool.

Screen Capture Tool— This tool can capture the desktop of a victim's
system (see Figure 5).

RarStar — This custom tool uploads RAR archives to a speciﬁed URL as
POST data (see Figure 6). RarStar encodes the POST data using Base64
and a custom XOR algorithm.

BRONZE BUTLER has also used the following publicly available tools, but CTU
researchers determined that the group modiﬁed most of them. Analysis of the
ﬁles identiﬁed the use of multiple packers, adjusted functionality in the source
code, and recompilation.

Mimikatz — This tool retrieves passwords from memory.
Windows Credential Editor (WCE) — This tool obtains passwords from
memory.
gsecdump — This tool obtains passwords from memory.
T-SMB Scan — This SMB scanning tool was originally published on a
Chinese program-sharing website (pudn.com). BRONZE BUTLER removed its
help message functionality.
WinRAR — This tool extracts tools for lateral movement and compresses
data for exﬁltration.

Tactics, techniques, and procedures
Incident response engagements have given CTU researchers insight into the
tactics that BRONZE BUTLER employs during intrusions.

Delivery

BRONZE BUTLER uses spearphishing emails and SWCs to compromise target
networks, often leveraging Flash. The group has used phishing emails with
Flash animation attachments to download and execute Daserf malware, and has
also leveraged Flash exploits for SWC attacks.
CTU researchers observed BRONZE BUTLER using compromised websites,
typically located in Japan and South Korea, as part of its attack infrastructure.
The group has demonstrated a capability to compromise and leverage a large
number of websites in its campaigns. Based on the large quantity of C2
PDF generated automatically by the PDFmyURL HTML to PDF API

servers and varying IP addresses used during the same operation, the group
also appears to purchase attack infrastructure. BRONZE BUTLER has leveraged
a distinct attack infrastructure for different targets, suggesting that the group
proactively segments operational infrastructure to minimize the risk of attribution
by security researchers.

Exploitation

While investigating a 2016 intrusion, Secureworks incident responders identiﬁed
BRONZE BUTLER exploiting a then-unpatched remote code execution
vulnerability (CVE-2016-7836) in SKYSEA Client View, a popular Japanese
product used to manage an organization's IT assets. SKY Corporation
announced the vulnerability on December 21, 2016, but entries in the victim's
SKYSEA Client View default log (CtlCli.log) show that the group had exploited
the issue since at least June 2016 (see Figure 7).

Figure 7. SKYSEA Client View log entries resulting from CVE-2016-7836
exploitation. (Source: Secureworks)
This vulnerability can be exposed when a portable connection device, such as
an LTE USB modem, is connected to corporate devices. It is common for
remote Japanese workers to use portable connection devices to connect to
PDF generated automatically by the PDFmyURL HTML to PDF API

the Internet and corporate VPNs. However, some of these devices assign the
ISP's global IP address to the connected laptop. Threat actors could exploit
the vulnerability to impersonate the management console, and compromise the
laptop's SKYSEA agent that is exposed on the Internet.
BRONZE BUTLER conducted periodic Internet scans to ﬁnd vulnerable hosts.
CTU researchers veriﬁed that some exploited systems were not subject to
further compromise or lateral movement. This outcome suggests that the group
may deploy malware to all identiﬁed vulnerable systems, but then pursues
speciﬁc targets after validating the system's association with organizations of
interest.

Installation

The threat actors use multiple custom downloaders that rely on executable
ﬁles (Gofarer, MSGet, and xxmm downloader), PowerShell scripts, or VBS/VBE
scripts. These downloaders use HTTP trafﬁc, download an additional payload
such as Daserf, Datper, or xxmm in a compressed and encoded format, and
typically execute the downloaded malware after decoding the ﬁle.
CTU researchers identiﬁed the code in Figure 8 within a downloader program.
This code inserts ‘0' characters at the end of the executable ﬁle to inﬂate the
ﬁle size to 50-100 MB, likely to evade antivirus software detection. When
analyzing BRONZE BUTLER incidents, CTU researchers observed several antivirus
tools skip scanning of inﬂated ﬁles.

CTU researchers also observed BRONZE BUTLER copying downloader source
code to a ﬁle (do.cs) on a compromised system and then compiling it into an
executable ﬁle (do.exe). The decrypted proxy log shows the threat actors
compiling custom code on the compromised system (see Figure 9).

compromised endpoint. (Source: Secureworks)

Command and control (C2) communication

Daserf, Datper, and xxmm communicate with C2 servers via HTTP, encrypting
commands and data using the algorithms in Table 1. The tools use an Internet
Explorer component to bypass proxy authentication as long as the
compromised system communicates during the authorized times deﬁned by the
proxy server.

BRONZE BUTLER uses unique C2 servers for each tool and changes C2
servers periodically. A large proportion of the group's C2 servers are hosted in
Japan. The presence of certain URL patterns in proxy logs (see Table 2) can
reveal BRONZE BUTLER activity.

BRONZE BUTLER leverages the remote access capabilities in these tools, often
using existing PC vendors' directories such as C:\DELL and C:\HP as working
directories in compromised environments. CTU researchers have also observed
threat actors using the following working directories:
C:\Intel\
C:\Intel\Logs\
C:\Intel\ExtremeGraphics\CUI\
C:\PerfLogs\Admin\

Credential access

BRONZE BUTLER uses credential theft tools such as Mimikatz and WCE to steal
authentication information from the memory of compromised hosts. Several
xxmm samples analyzed by CTU researchers incorporate Mimikatz, allowing the
threat actors to issue Mimikatz commands directly from xxmm (see Figure 10).
In addition, xxmm incorporates a UAC bypass tool for privilege escalation prior
to stealing passwords.

Figure 10. Mimikatz command in xxmm. (Source: Secureworks)
CTU analysis revealed BRONZE BUTLER creating forged Kerberos Ticket
Granting Ticket (TGT) and Ticket Granting Service (TGS) tickets (also called
PDF generated automatically by the PDFmyURL HTML to PDF API

golden and silver tickets, respectively) to maintain administrative access. Figure
11 shows an example of the threat actors creating a golden ticket.

Figure 11. Kerberos golden ticket created by BRONZE BUTLER. (Source:
Secureworks)
Golden tickets require a username, but the domain controller does not validate
that it is legitimate. CTU researchers detected BRONZE BUTLER using the
following usernames for golden tickets:
bgtras
bgtrs
kkir
kisetr
netkin
orumls
wert

Host enumeration

The threat actors typically use built-in Windows ping and net commands for
network and host enumeration activity to eventually contact the ﬁle-share
server (see Figure 12). BRONZE BUTLER also uses the T-SMB Scan tool to list
available SMB hosts, and screen-capture tools to obtain additional information.

Lateral movement

After compromising a host, the threat actors attempt to compromise other
connected systems to move within the network. BRONZE BUTLER typically uses
the following procedure for lateral movement:
1. Use ‘net use' and ‘copy' commands to transfer a malicious ﬁle (such
as malware) from the compromised host to a target system on the
same network.
2. Use the ‘net time' command to check the local time on the target
system.
3. Use the ‘at' or ‘schtask' commands to register a scheduled task to
be executed in a few minutes.
4. After a few minutes, execute the malicious ﬁle on the system.
The malicious ﬁle is typically a batch ﬁle that downloads malware and registers
the malware's automatic execution in the registry. Figure 13 shows the
PDF generated automatically by the PDFmyURL HTML to PDF API

scheduled task that executes zrun.bat (a batch ﬁle) using the at command.

Figure 13. Scheduled task registration. (Source: Secureworks)
Figure 14 shows the batch ﬁle (zrun.bat) executing, which adds a registry entry
that auto-executes the malware.

Figure 14. Registry entry added to auto-execute malware. (Source:
Secureworks)
CTU researchers have also observed BRONZE BUTLER giving malware the same
name as an existing document ﬁle on the ﬁle share server to cause users to
unwittingly launch and install the malware on additional systems (see Figure 15).

Exﬁltration

BRONZE BUTLER typically creates a list of ﬁles (i.e., a shopping list) from
compromised hosts and ﬁle-share servers. If the list is short, the group
exﬁltrates the ﬁles directly. For large lists, the threat actors use the following
procedure:
1. Use malware to upload the large list of enumerated ﬁles to the C2
server.
2. Select speciﬁc ﬁles to steal, creating a new list.
3. Use downloaders or other malware to send the new list to a
compromised host.
4. Use archiving software to collect ﬁles in a password-protected
archive.
5. Use an uploader or other malware to send the archived ﬁles to an
attacker-controlled server. The uploader software is proprietary to
this group, but Datper and xxmm also contain an uploading feature.
When exﬁltration is complete, the uploader (or Datper or xxmm)
immediately uses the del command to delete the RAR archives.
Figure 16 shows BRONZE BUTLER extracting a new list of ﬁles and archiving a
speciﬁc ﬁle into RAR format for exﬁltration.

The group uses a password to encrypt ﬁles for RAR archiving. CTU researchers
have observed the following passwords used in BRONZE BUTLER network
compromises:
1234qwer
1234qwer!
1234$%qwer
1qazxsw2
1qazxcde32ws

Conclusion
BRONZE BUTLER compromises organizations to conduct cyberespionage,
PDF generated automatically by the PDFmyURL HTML to PDF API

primarily focusing on Japanese enterprises. Initial attack vectors include
spearphishing emails, SWCs, and exploiting vulnerability in software commonly
used by Japanese businesses. The group can override security controls to
exﬁltrate intellectual property, and victims should formulate a solid eviction plan
before engaging with the threat actors to prevent them from reentering the
network.
CTU researchers recommend that organizations, particularly those whose assets
and intellectual property could be valuable to BRONZE BUTLER, implement the
following security practices:
Review proxy log settings to ensure they capture information such as HTTP
parameters and User-Agents for future analysis. Search proxy log ﬁles for
evidence of web server scanning using the URL patterns associated with
BRONZE BUTLER activity.
Use an advanced endpoint threat detection (AETD) solution to monitor
activity on network endpoints. Install a background monitor tool (e.g.,
Sysmon) to log detailed Windows event information to assist with incident
response.
Implement timely vulnerability patching and system updates. Update
SKYSEA Client View implementations to the latest version as soon as
possible.
Review network access control. In particular, review network access for
use of mobile USB modems on corporate systems. Also implement strict
security controls for privileged accounts such as Active Directory
administrator to prevent access by an unauthorized user.
