Last week we talked about the Remote Administration Trojan DarkComet and all the
wonderful and scary things it can do. In response to the twitter post announcing the blog, the
author of DarkComet tweeted an answer to my big bold question:
“Considering that this is a Remote Administration Tool, to be used for good and what
not….WHY DOES IT HAVE DDOS FUNCTIONALITY!?”
His answer was that he typically uses it for “Performing tests on his personal network to
make sure it can protect against those kinds of attacks.” To simplify the answer, it’s like he
built a bomb in order to see if his house was explosion-proof. He isn’t lying, it is possible to
test your own defenses with such a weapon. I will leave it up to you, the reader, to decide
whether or not that is a good enough reason to include the capability to perform Distributed
Denial of Service attacks in his software.
Moving on, I know that I talked about how dangerous DarkComet was and that while there
were a lot of illegitimate uses for it, it was mostly designed as a network administration tool
and therefore, could be used for legitimate purposes. This week I am going to tell you about
the opposite of DarkComet, a very powerful and very dangerous RAT Trojan known as
BlackShades NET.

1/12

Introduction:
There are quite a few different types of RAT malware floating around in the wild right now
that are used by people ranging from amateur hackers all the way up to cyber-crime
organizations. DarkComet is one of them and BlackShades NET is another, more
dangerous one.
BlackShades is a very powerful RAT which sports all the functionality of DarkComet and then
some. The methods in which it infects its victims spread over a large band of different
methods, to name a few:
Fake torrent downloads on Person to Person (P2P) sites
Malicious links spread in chat rooms
Drive-by attacks
Java exploits
Spreading via hacked social media/chat accounts
Phishing e-mails
This list applies to most methods of spreading RATs and malware in general.

Background:
BlackShades NET is developed (I say IS because new versions are always coming out) by
BlackShades the company, their official “About Us” is:
“BlackShades is mainly an IT surveillance and security-based company, directed at making
your PC experiences easier. Our main goal is to offer affordable software solutions
comparable to bigger names out there.”
They also mention the reasons people should buy and use their products including:
Spying on spouses or children
Being suspicious about possibly cheating partners
Being paranoid about people using your PC in unwanted ways
Finally, to ease the tension about whether or not their software is legal, for the paranoid
delusional with a conscience, they include a legal notice about an Act passed in 2004
allowing people to spy on their own systems:
“… according to the Spy Act passed in October 5th 2004 by US houses, installation of
advertising or data gathering spyware without authorization or the computer owner’s consent
is prohibited, but it is still legal to install any program you want to your own computer. Main

2/12

part of the Spy Act is about adware and spyware related software and website which use to
gather user information for advertisement. It’s 100% legal for you to install spy software on
your own computer.”
The BlackShades website offers a variety of products which can help to accomplish the
goals listed above; however the only one we are interested in is the BlackShades Remote
Controller or BlackShades NET. While there are multiple methods available to obtain free or
cracked versions of the RAT, the BlackShades website includes a method to buy the up-todate software from them for only $40!

Terms of Use

In order to keep their product legal and keep themselves out of any sort of trouble or blame
for the actions of the users of the product, BlackShades includes a Terms of Use, basically
requiring the user to agree to not stealing their software and not using it in the wrong way, for
example:
“INTENTIONALLY SPREADING APPLICATIONS FOR MALICIOUS OR DAMAGING
PURPOSES IS A CRIME PUNISHABLE BY FINE OR IMPRISONMENT. BY USING
BlackShades NET PRODUCTS FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES YOU ARE BREAKING THE
TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET IN THIS AGREEMENT AND THEREFORE ACCEPT FULL
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY CONSEQUENCES WHICH MAY RESULT FROM YOUR
ACTIONS.”
This is just one piece of a very long use agreement; it even makes the user wait a few
seconds before they can click the “I Agree” button, I suppose to make them read at least
some of it.

What does it do?

3/12

Last week I listed a lot of different kinds of functionality used by DarkComet including spying
on the webcam, uninstalling programs, fun functions, etc. Well BlackShades can do nearly
all of these things so I am not going to repeat any previously mentioned functionality in any
detail. Instead, I will discuss a few interesting things that BlackShades can do that
DarkComet cannot…also, when I say interesting I mean frightening.
The BlackShades web site mentions a lot of the functionality the RAT is capable of, from
various system administration functions to surveillance functions and computer security. It
doesn’t actually mention ALL of its functionality, as we will discuss, and I think that they might
have a hard time explaining on their website the purpose of some of the following functions.
Ransomware

You might be aware of all the attention Ransom Malware, or Ransomware, has been getting
lately. To refresh anyone’s memory, Ransomware is used to hijack a system, sometimes by
locking the user out entirely, sometimes by encrypting all the files with a unique key. A notice
like the one above will show up and the user has the choice to either pay a Ransom fee or
lose access to their files and/or system. Named the ‘File Hijacker’, BlackShades has the
ability to use its server implant to create a Ransomware situation.
The configuration interface includes customization of the ransom message, screen colors,
timer, encryption key and the target path of the files to be encrypted as well as which file
extensions to encrypt. Depending on how many files the ‘Hijacker’ has to encrypt
determines how long it will take for the ransom functionality to encrypt all requested files and
show the ransom information screen (above) to the user. If, for example, the attacker decides
to encrypt all .EXE files in the root C:\ partition and all the folders included in that partition,
then it might take a while. In that time the user might experience some system lag and an
inability to access certain files or applications. Once the demands of the attacker are met,
they repeat the exact same encryption process and it fixes everything; which makes me
believe that the encryption process is probably nothing more than a simple encryption
algorithm (XOR, Bit Shifting, etc).

4/12

To add to how much BlackShades wants the attacker to really think about how severe a
ransom attack is, he/she must click the “I’m responsible for whatever this action results in”
button and type ‘YES” into a confirmation popup.

If the attacker clicks the “Help” button in the configuration window, it will give an explanation
of what the attack does, how to fix it and a little notice at the end stating:
WARNING!
You should be extremely careful when dealing with this feature.
Use this feature at your own risk.
However, one thing to put in mind:
This feature was made for educational purposes only.
This is another example of BlackShades removing all liability of anything done with this tool
from themselves and putting it on the user. Pretty slick if you ask me.
Facebook Controller
Have you ever wondered how hackers are able to control the Facebook posts of victim
users? Well there are a lot of ways to do that, including stealing saved credentials,
keylogging, etc. BlackShades has its own method, where it allows the attacker to post text on
the wall of the victim. The functionality is called ‘Facebook Controller’ and can be used as
long as the victim user is logged into Facebook.
When I say logged in, I of course mean having Facebook up in a window, etc. I also mean
that if you don’t properly log-out of Facebook, you just close your browser, your Facebook
credentials are still valid and you are still logged in. The RAT will secretly post whatever text
5/12

it wants to your Facebook wall. This can be something as simple as “Hello!” or it could be a
URL or link to a malicious website or executable which could spread the malware to your
friends and family.

The above screenshot is a view of the Facebook Controller configuration window. It allows
the attacker to customize what text to use for the wall post, it also gives the status of whether
the attack succeeded or not.
I wanted to do some more testing and see if the Facebook Controller actually worked. I
wouldn’t recommend doing this at home since I knew that I had full control of the RAT and
you might not be able to obtain that same confidence. I decided to log into my own Facebook
and try this out, notice the text at the bottom of the Facebook Controller configuration window
(above) and the new status update I apparently posted (below):

USB Infector / IM Spreader
You’ve probably heard in the news lately about USBs being infected to spread malware to
any systems they are plugged into, etc. etc. Well this particular type of attack has been
happening for at least 5 years now, with different methods being used to accomplish it.
Lucky for us, BlackShades uses an older method of USB infection that is easy to get around
by just disabling any auto-run feature in your version of Windows.

6/12

The above screenshot shows the configuration window for the USB infection/IM sending
function known as ‘Spreader’. The USB infector simply puts a copy of the originating
infections binary or ‘server’ onto any USB drive currently connected to the victim, it then
creates an ‘Autorun.inf’ script which is used to execute the file once run, both files are
hidden. If this USB driver were to be plugged into another system, one which did not disable
the auto-run feature, the auto-run file would run and execute the malware, the result being
that the attacker has another system to play with:

The other functionality of the ‘spreader’ is to send an IM to everyone on the contact list of the
victim using MSN or AIM/ICQ. This message is customizable and could include a link to a
malicious site or a download for the RAT infection binary.
Torrent Seeder

7/12

Torrents are most commonly referenced when talking about pirating software or movies and
music and as mentioned before, using P2P torrent sites, spreading malware! This
functionality allows the attacker to download a torrent file from somewhere on the web and
host it on the victims system or ‘seed’ it; allowing other people to download it directly from
the user. This could result in the malware, which is used to trick someone else into installing
a Blackshades implant binary, being downloaded from an already infected victim system.
There would be no trace of the identity of the hacker spreading the malware.
There are a few requirements for this functionality to work, first of all the victim must have
some kind of P2P file transfer software installed. If the victim does not have any installed, the
attacker could go through the effort of downloading and installing it for them by using the
download and execute functionality, as well as the remote desktop. There are also only a
certain group of P2P clients which can be used:
uTorrent
BitTorrent
Azerus/Vuze
LimeWire
There are multiple uses for this type of functionality; including being able to spread even
more malware with fake torrent descriptions. Using the user to host and spread pirated
movies and software, etc. If tracked down by a law enforcement agency, they would only
find the torrent file being seeded by the victim user and not be able to trace it back to the
attacker, unless of course the attacker was still running the BlackShades implant on the
victim system and beaconing back at regular intervals.
Bot Marketplace
As we know, the world of botnets and espionage is also very marketable. That’s why
BlackShades included a marketplace interface into their RAT controller:

Here the attacker can buy and/or sell bots to other BlackShades users to make their network
larger, the interface includes information on how to buy and sell and a listing of all current
buyers or sellers currently in the network:

8/12

You can also buy Crypters using this interface, which are essentially packers and obfuscation
tools to make it more difficult for antivirus engines to detect the implant binary:

This functionality, as well as some others mentioned, takes BlackShades out of the realm of
the personal use system administration tool. It elevates it to the same level as cybercrime
organizations.
DDOS
I said earlier that I wasn’t going to go into any detail about repeated functionality from
DarkComet to BlackShades, however I wanted to show you the configuration interface for
BlackShades RAT. It is very clean and streamlined and makes it very easy to send multiple
types of DDOS attacks:

Other Functions
I didn’t mention every function of BlackShades, just the ones I thought were the most
important to mention, I wanted to give a short list of the ones I left out and there might even
be some duplicates from DarkComet in there too:
Webcam Control
9/12

Screenshot/Remote Desktop Control
Keylogger (streamlined and much cleaner than DarkComet)
Proxy manager
Download and Execute Files (or more malware)
Visit a website numerous times
Redirect or Block URLs
Use victim as a reverse relay, meaning that the attacker can set their browser to
connect to the internet through the victim system.
Control MSN messenger, including add/remove/msg contacts.
Set an alarm for when a certain window title or keyword is present on the victim system
Ability to setup a web interface for remote use!
And much more!

How does it do it?
It does it in the same way that DarkComet did it, an encrypted stream of data going between
the client and the server, often with constant beaconing. Safe to say, RATs are not quiet
when it comes to network traffic, but when your targets are pirated movie downloaders or
click-happy social networking users, traffic detection is not really a huge concern.
Server Creation

The server creator for BlackShades comes with fewer options than the server creator for
DarkComet did:
Beacon IP/Hostname
Port / Transfer Port
Server ID
Filename
Install path – where the server will be stored upon installation
Application Data
Temp Directory
Install Mode

10/12

Install – copy the file to the designated directory (%AppData%, %Temp%)
Melt – Delete the file after it’s run
Protect Process – Do not allow the process to be killed
Delay – How long after execution to wait before installation
No Delay
10 Seconds
1 Min
5 Mins
HKCU – What Registry entry to use for installation.
ActiveX Key – Generate a unique value for the binary to use during operations and
installation
Mutex – Generate a unique value for the binary to use during operations and
installation, also keeps from multiple instances of the same server running at the same
time.
And the ability to:
Infect USBs
Compress the binary with the UPX packer
Change the Icon
Clone file information – For example the installed binary will match the same
properties of a legitimate file. The file to clone is chosen by the attacker.
Basically, DarkComet was able to configure various types of “Upon installation” actions as
well as the ability to make each server binary slightly different from the previous one.
Blackshades will produce nearly the same binary every time, as long as the default
configurations available with the server builder are used. This means that if the attacker
decides to purchase a new and undetected crypter, they could potentially avoid antivirus
detection and still obtain the same results of DarkComet.

How do you protect yourself?
If you have Malwarebytes Anti-Malware Pro installed, one of three things can happen to
protect you.
The web site you were sent to with the exploit would have never loaded thanks to
Malwarebytes Web Protection Module
Malwarebytes Anti-Malware definitions scan for unique features at a deeper level than
other AV vendors and are more likely to detect new variants of the same malware.
Malwarebytes Anti-Malwares active protection module would have detected the
malware being executed on your system and prevented it from going any further based
upon its functionality.

11/12

On top of that, RAT infection is usually the product of targeted attacks, though not always the
case. They do make a lot of noise and more often than not antivirus/Anti-Malware software
will detect and remove any infection. As a general precaution, here is a list of standard
security practices you can do to keep yourself safe:
Always keep up to date definitions of your Anti-Virus/Anti-Malware software
Always update your operating system
Never click on links in e-mails from people you do not know or trust
Always keep the most up to date security patches for your browser and extension
applications (Adobe products, Java, etc.)
While these measures seem simple enough, they are the best protection for your system
while not draining your ability to perform standard tasks and your wallet.
