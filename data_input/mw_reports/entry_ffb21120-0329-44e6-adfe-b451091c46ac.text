If you want to quickly find out how to use Splunk to find activity related to the DarkSide
Ransomware, skip to the “Detection and Remediation of DarkSide” section. Otherwise, read
on for a quick breakdown of what happened to the Colonial Pipeline, how to detect the
ransomware, and view MITRE ATT&CK mappings.

Introduction to the Colonial Pipeline Ransomware Attack
It might be more expensive for you to take that Great American Road Trip this summer
because filling up the tank of the Family Truckster may cost you some serious Dogecoin.
Let us give you a little bit more color on this:

2/16

Late on Friday, May 7th, one of the US’s largest gasoline pipelines was preemptively shut
down by operator Colonial Pipeline, because their corporate computer networks were
affected by Ransomware-as-a-Service authored and maintained by the group DarkSide.
This 5500 mile pipeline transports about 45% of the East Coast’s fuel supplies, and at the
time of this blog, Colonial Pipeline had not returned to full operation. Now, mind you, the
ransomware did not directly cause the pipeline to shut down - rather, Colonial shut
down operations voluntarily out of an abundance of caution. But until they can be sure that
the adversary leveraging the DarkSide ransomware for the attack does not have the ability
to affect operations, the pipeline will remain dry. Colonial is hoping to get the pipeline back
to operation by the end of this week.
Regardless of how all of this plays out, what Splunk customers want to know is how to
detect and mitigate DarkSide ransomware, especially if they work in critical infrastructure. In
fact, last year CISA released an alert about ransomware targeting pipeline operators - so
we know this is a big deal. And, they just updated it today with new alert guidance (AA21131A) specific to DarkSide.
After review, we’re happy to find that the behavior of this ransomware isn’t particularly
novel, and all of the guidance we’ve shared for years on ransomware detection and
mitigation applies. Let’s review that guidance, and update it where appropriate.

What You Need to Know
One of the last significant ransomware events was the Ryuk ransomware at the end of
October 2020, however our specialists pointed out that Ryuk wasn’t particularly novel in
terms of its operation. Our Threat Research team also posted about detecting the Clop
ransomware last month and recently updated further.
Is the DarkSide variant of ransomware more interesting than either of these? No, it isn’t!
However, there’s significant worldwide interest because of the target chosen. We also see
these “affiliate” actors attempt a “double extortion” where not only have they encrypted
critical business data, they’re also threatening to release it publicly if additional ransom is
not paid. DarkSide also contains a killswitch if it detects a Russian language environment.
There are also reports that the ongoing global pandemic has made infections like this
easier, because operational staff may be working from home and that may broaden the
attack surface. However, this is not new, as remote access for Operational Technology (OT)
networks is commonplace and long predates the pandemic.

Splunk & Ransomware: Not Our First Rodeo
As we’ve stated, this blog ain’t the first time we’re covering our approach to Ransomware.

Detection and Remediation of DarkSide Using Splunk
As regular readers of our blogs will expect, we normally fill this section with TTPs pulled
from the zero-day or possibly a breakdown of a new malware variant. But, after reviewing
the last six seven years of content that Splunk has created, we are again proud to say we
already have you covered. In the list of detections below, you will notice that we did not
break out IOCs. As David Bianco has pyramidized in the past, IOCs are ephemeral and
change often! I recommend working with a threat intel provider for any low-level IOCs like
hashes or IPs. Throw them into a Lookup table or ES threat intel framework, and off you go!
If you don’t have a threat intel provider, start skimming Twitter for some tremendous opensource lists.
The fine folks at CyberReason have a detailed walkthrough of how DarkSide behaves after
the initial foothold. From a Splunk detection perspective, here are some things we suggest
collecting:

4/16

Process execution logs, from our favorite Windows Security 4688 events, or Sysmon
EventCode 1, or any commercial EDR, are, as always, key to detection of the
parent/child process relationships involved in actions on intent and lateral movement
as well as the deletion of Volume Shadow Copies.
PowerShell Script Block Logging is also critical, so that you can detect certain
modules like WebClient.DownloadFile being used where you don’t expect, as well as
the use of encoded PowerShell.
Windows System events, so that you can detect Scheduled Tasks being created and
enabled (4698, 4700).

And as always, unusual network connections from servers and endpoints (can be
accomplished via firewall, proxy, Sysmon EventCode 3, or EDR logs) and DNS query
logging will be helpful.

Splunk Security Essentials
In case you are unaware (or living under a rock for the last two years), Splunk Security
Essentials is the place to get Splunk’s security content. And since our last-go round with
Ryuk, we’ve updated Splunk Security Essentials and made it a fully-supported Splunk
product (but it’s still free!). When you boot up the app, navigate to “Security Content
Library,” and search for Ransomware, you get a plethora of content!

Splunk Enterprise Security and ESCU
Know Thyself
While we have spent some time explaining this attack and effort needs to be put toward
investigating this, it is also important to note that the basics are important. Basic asset
management, hopefully via your asset and identity framework, will tell you where your
vulnerable systems reside. Running regular vulnerability scans that integrate into Splunk
will display which systems are vulnerable and can help you prioritize your patching
schedule and better focus your detection efforts.

6/16

Splunk Enterprise Security and ESCU

Threat Intelligence Framework
If you are using Splunk Enterprise Security (ES), many organizations are posting IOCs that
can be ingested easily into the threat intelligence framework. Perhaps you aren’t sure how
to do that? No worries, we published some guidance and a how-to on integrating lists of
IOCs into the Enterprise Security threat intelligence framework. We won’t be publishing a
list of IOCs along with this blog as they are quite ephemeral, but use of the Threat
Intelligence Framework (or standard lookups within Splunk) will allow you to easily perform
IOC matching.

Enterprise Security Content Updates (ESCU)

7/16

For folks using ESCU, our Splunk Threat Research team will release a new Splunk Analytic
Story called Darkside Ransomware by the end of this week containing detections for this
threat. Saying that, check out the MITRE ATT&CK table below. If you have ESCU running
today, you already have some great coverage!

MITRE ATT&CK
Reviewing one of the first blog posts on DarkSide Ransomware from Digital Shadows in
September 2020, we extracted their MITRE ATT&CK tactics and then linked to Splunk
Content to help you hunt for that information. Be aware; these searches are provided as a
way to accelerate your hunting. We recommend you configure them via the Splunk Security
Essentials App. You may need to modify them to work in your environment! Many of these
searches are optimized for use with the tstats command.
Finally, as more information becomes available, we will update these searches if more
ATT&CK TTPs become known.

Conclusion
We know that such a publicly visible example of the impact of Ransomware can stoke
visceral fear, but we’ve got your back. Hopefully, these searches, blogs, videos, conference
papers, and whitepapers will provide you the ability to have more visibility into your
environment and any malicious activity that you might be experiencing. If they don’t work
perfectly, think of them as “SplunkSpiration” :-). As soon as we have more information, we
will update this blog and, as we talked about earlier, be on the lookout for some more
detailed info about DarkSide and an Analytic Story delivered via ESCU from our Splunk
Threat Research team.
