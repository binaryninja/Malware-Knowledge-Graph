I analyzed a PCAP file from a sandbox execution of the Evil Extractor stealer malware earlier
today. This stealer collects credentials and files of interest from the victim’s computer and
exfiltrates them to an FTP server. It is designed to autonomously collect and exfiltrate data
rather than receiving commands from an operator through a command-and-control channel.
The EvilExtractor creators market this feature as a “golden bullet”.
Real hackers don’t use reverse shells right? If you have only one bullet, would you
waste with reverse shell? Try Evil Extractor to have golden bullet.
I downloaded the Evil Extractor capture file from Triage to a Windows Sandbox environment,
to avoid accidentally infecting my computer when extracting artifacts from the PCAP. I then
opened it up in the free version of NetworkMiner.
NetworkMiner shows that after checking its public IP on ipinfo.io EvilExtractor makes an
unencrypted HTTP connection to a web server on 193.42.33.232 to download KK2023.zip.
This zip archive contains a file called “Lst.exe” which is used to steal browser data, cookies
and credentials according to Fortinet.

Twenty seconds later an FTP connection is established to 89.116.53.55 on TCP port 21. The
username and password used to authenticate to the FTP server was “u999382941” and
“Test1234”.

On the FTP server EvilExtractor creates a directory named after the country and hostname
of the victim's PC, such as “(Sweden)DESKTOP-VV03LJ”, in which it creates the following
three sub directories:
1-Password-Cookies
2-Credentials
3-Files

3/7

After uploading browser cookies, browser history and cached passwords from Chrome,
Firefox and Edge to the “1-Password-Cookies” directory EvilExtractor sends a file called
“Credentials.txt” to the “2-Credentials” directory. The contents of this text file looks something
like this:
Public IP: [redacted]
Location: [lat],[long]
Computer Name: [redacted]
Username: Admin
RAM: 4 GB
OS Name: Microsoft Windows 10 Pro
OS Bit: 64-bit
Keyboard Language: en-US
GPU: [redacted]
CPU: Intel [redacted]
MAC Address: [redacted]
Extracted WIFI: [redacted]
The stealer also exfiltrates files with mpeg, docx, jpeg, pptx, zip, avi and rar extensions from
the victim PC to the “3-Files” directory on the FTP server. The directory structure of the
victim’s PC is maintained on the FTP server, so that files from the victim's desktop end up in
a folder called “Desktop” on the FTP server.

The stealer later downloaded a keylogger module (Confirm.zip) and a webcam module
(MnMs.zip), but no additional data was exfiltrated from this particular victim PC after that
point.

Update 2023-04-27
Jane tweeted a link to an execution of this same sample on ANY.RUN. This execution
showed very similar results as the one on Triage, but with an interesting twist. Not only did
the ANY.RUN execution exfiltrate images and documents from the Desktop and Downloads
folders, it also exfiltrated “vv9wvsfb2v_pw_infected.zip”, which contained the EvilExtractor
EXE file that was being run!
