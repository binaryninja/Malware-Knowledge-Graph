Operation AppleJeus: Lazarus hits cryptocurrency exchange with fake installer and macOS malware - Securelist

hits cryptocurrency exchange
with fake installer and macOS
malware
By GReAT on August 23, 2018. 8:00 am

Overview
Lazarus has been a major threat actor in the APT arena for several years. Alongside goals like
cyberespionage and cybersabotage, the attacker has been targeting banks and other ﬁnancial companies
around the globe. Over the last few months, Lazarus has successfully compromised several banks and
inﬁltrated a number of global cryptocurrency exchanges and ﬁntech companies.
Kaspersky Lab has been assisting with incident response eﬀorts. While investigating a cryptocurrency
exchange attacked by Lazarus, we made an unexpected discovery. The victim had been infected with the
help of a trojanized cryptocurrency trading application, which had been recommended to the company
over email. It turned out that an unsuspecting employee of the company had willingly downloaded a thirdparty application from a legitimate looking website and their computer had been infected with malware
known as Fallchill, an old tool that Lazarus has recently switched back to. There have been multiple reports
on the reappearance of Fallchill, including one from US-CERT.
To ensure that the OS platform was not an obstacle to infecting targets, it seems the attackers went the
extra mile and developed malware for other platforms, including for macOS. A version for Linux is
apparently coming soon, according to the website. It’s probably the ﬁrst time we see this APT group using
malware for macOS.

The fact that the Lazarus group has expanded its list of targeted operating systems should be a wake-up call
for users of non-Windows platforms.

Trojanized cryptocurrency trading application
Thanks to Kaspersky Lab’s malicious-behavior detection technology, implemented in its endpoint security
software, we were able to reassemble the stages of infection and trace them back to their origin. This
helped us understand that one of Lazarus’ victims was infected with malware after installing a
cryptocurrency trading program. We also conﬁrmed that the user installed this program via a download link
delivered over email.

Trojanized trading application for Windows
Including malicious code into distributed software and putting that on a website would be too obvious.
Instead, the attackers went for a more elaborate scheme: the trojan code was pushed out in the form of an
update for a trading application.
A legitimate-looking application called Celas Trade Pro from Celas Limited showed no signs of malicious
behaviour and looked genuine. This application is an all-in-one style cryptocurrency trading program
developed by Celas.

When we started this research, any user could download the trading application from the Celas website.
Checking the installation package downloaded from the website conﬁrmed the presence of a very
suspicious updater.

Installation package download page
We have analyzed the following Windows version of the installation package:
MD5: 9e740241ca2acdc79f30ad2c3f50990a
File name: celastradepro_win_installer_1.00.00.msi
File type: MSI installer
Creation time: 2018-06-29 01:16:00 UTC
At the end of the installation process, the installer immediately runs the Updater.exe module with the
“CheckUpdate” parameter. This ﬁle looks like a regular tool and most likely will not arouse the suspicion of
system administrators. After all, it even contains a valid digital signature, which belongs to the same vendor.
But the devil is in the detail, as usual.
The code writer developed this project under the codename “jeus”, which was discovered in a PDB path
included in the updater and used as unique HTTP multipart message data separator string. Because of this,

and the fact that the attacked platforms include Apple macOS, we decided to call this Operation AppleJeus.

Properties of the shady updater tool included in the package are:
MD5: b054a7382adf6b774b15f52d971f3799
File Type: PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows
Known ﬁle name: %Program Files%\CelasTradePro\Updater.exe
Link Time: 2018-06-15 10:56:27 UTC
Build path: Z:\jeus\downloader\downloader_exe_vs2010\Release\dloader.pdb
The main purpose of Updater.exe is to collect the victim’s host information and send it back to the server.
Upon launch, the malware creates a unique string with the format string template “%09d-%05d” based on
random values, which is used as a unique identiﬁer of the infected host. This malware collects process lists,
excluding “[System Process]” and “System” processes and gets the exact OS version from the registry value
at “HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion”. It seems that such values only exist from
Windows 10, so we assume that the author developed and tested it on Windows 10.
ProductName: Windows OS version
CurrentBuildNumber: Windows 10 build version
ReleaseID: Windows 10 version information
UBR: Sub version of Windows 10 build
BuildBranch: Windows 10 build branch information
The code encrypts the collected information with the hardcoded XOR key (“Moz&Wie;#t/6T!2y“) before
uploading it to the server.

Data encryption routine
The code sends the victim’s information to a webserver using HTTP and the following URL:
www.celasllc[.]com/checkupdate.php
The server is a legitimate looking website owned by the developer of the program: Celas LLC. At this point
we were not able to conclude with high conﬁdence whether the server was compromised by the threat
actor or had belonged to the threat actor from the beginning. To learn more about the server, please read
the “Infrastructure” section below.
The malware used a hardcoded User-Agent string “Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.1;
Trident/6.0)” and ﬁxed a multipart form data separator string “jeus“.
Using encryption, the custom separator string wouldn’t be a red ﬂag for a legitimate application, but
sending a request with the context-irrelevant string “get_conﬁg”, as well as uploading collected system
information as “temp.gif”, mimicking a GIF image with a magic number in the header, deﬁnitely made us
raise our eyebrows.

After successfully uploading data, the updater checks the server response. If the server responds with HTTP
code 300, it means the updater should keep quiet and take no action. However, if the response is HTTP
code 200, it extracts the payload with base64 and decrypts it using RC4 with another hardcoded key
(“W29ab@ad%Df324V$Yd“). The decrypted data is an executable ﬁle that is prepended with the
“MAX_PATHjeusD” string.
During our research, we found other similar ﬁles. One was created on August 3rd and another on August
11th. The PDB path shows that the author keeps improving this updater tool, apparently forked from some
stable version released on July 2, 2018 according to the internal directory name.

Trojanized trading program for macOS
For macOS users, Celas LLC also provided a native version of its trading app. A hidden “autoupdater”
module is installed in the background to start immediately after installation, and after each system reboot. It
https://securelist.com/operation-applejeus/87553/

8/23/2018

keeps contacting the command and control (C2) server in order to download and run an additional

executable from the server. The communication conforms to the Windows version of the updater and is
disguised as an image ﬁle upload and download, while carrying encrypted data inside.
We have analyzed the following installation ﬁle:
MD5: 48ded52752de9f9b73c6bf9ae81cb429
File Size: 15,020,544 bytes
File Type: DMG disk image
Known ﬁle name: celastradepro_mac_installer_1.00.00.dmg
Date of creation: 13 July 2018
Once the Cellas Trade Pro app is installed on macOS, it starts the Updater application on the system load via
a ﬁle named “.com.celastradepro.plist” (note that it starts with a dot symbol, which makes it unlisted in the
Finder app or default Terminal directory listing). The “Updater” ﬁle is passed the “CheckUpdate” parameter
on start.

Celas Trade Pro app plist ﬁle (Apple Property List)

The command-line argument “CheckUpdate” looks redundant from a code analysis perspective: there is no
other argument that the application expects. In the absence of all arguments, it doesn’t do anything and
quits. This may or may not be way to trick sandboxes that could automatically execute this trojan updater,
with no suspicious activity produced without such a “secret” extra argument. The choice of a benign string
such as “CheckUpdate” helps it to hide in plain sight of any user or administrator looking into running
processes.
The trojanized updater works similar to the Windows version in many ways. Both applications are
implemented using a cross-platform QT framework. Upon launch, the downloader creates a unique
identiﬁer for the infected host using a “%09d-%06d” format string template. Next, the app collects basic
system information, which for macOS is done via dedicated QT classes:
Host name
OS type and version
System architecture
OS kernel type and version
The process of encrypting and transferring data is the same as in the Windows version. This information is
XOR-encrypted with hardcoded 16-byte static key “Moz&Wie;#t/6T!2y”, prepended with GIF89a header
and uploaded to the C2 server via HTTP POST and the following URL:
https://www.celasllc[.]com/checkupdate.php

https://securelist.com/operation-applejeus/87553/

9/30

8/23/2018

Operation AppleJeus: Lazarus hits cryptocurrency exchange with fake installer and macOS malware - Securelist

POST request template strings
The module relies on a hardcoded User-Agent string for macOS:
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko)
Chrome/66.0.3359.139 Safari/537.36
Once the server replies, it checks the HTTP response code. HTTP response code 300 indicates that the
server has no task for the updater and the application terminates immediately. If the HTTP response is code
200, then the updater gets the data in the response, decodes it from base64 encoding and decrypts it using
RC4 with the hardcoded static key “W29ab@ad%Df324V$Yd“. It calculates the MD5 of the decoded and
decrypted data, which is compared to a value stored inside, to verify the integrity of the transferred ﬁle.
After that, the payload is extracted and saved to a hardcoded ﬁle location “/var/zdiﬀsec“, sets executable
permissions for all users and starts the app with another secret hardcoded command-line argument
“bf6a0c760cc642“. Apparently the command-line argument is the way to prevent the detection of its
malicious functionality via sandboxes or even reverse engineering. We have previously seen this technique
adopted by Lazarus group in 2016 in attacks against banks. As of 2018, it is still using this in almost every
attack we investigated.

Downloaded payload
According to data from Kaspersky Security Network, the threat actor delivered the malicious payload using
one of the shadowy updaters described above. We found a malicious ﬁle created at the same host:
MD5: 0a15a33844c9df11f12a4889ae7b7e4b
File Size: 104,898,560 bytes
File Type: PE32+ executable (GUI) x86-64, for MS Windows
Known ﬁle name: C:\Recovery\msn.exe
Link time: 2018-04-19 13:30:19
Note the unusually large size for an executable ﬁle. We believe that it was inﬂated with junk data on
purpose to prevent easy download or transfer over the internet.

Searching for the reason for the malware’s appearance on the system revealed that there was an additional
process responsible for producing several ﬁles before this malware was launched, suggesting a trojan
dropper in action. The main function of this malware is to implant the Fallchill backdoor loader linked to
several ﬁles. Upon launch, the malware checks one of the command-line arguments passed to it. The
malware chooses one of the service names located in the following registry value as a disguise:
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Svchost\netsvcs
This value includes a list of several dozen standard system service names.
The randomly chosen service name is used to name the dropped ﬁle and newly registered Windows service.
Let’s refer to this randomly chosen service name as [service]. The malware contains references to several
ﬁles inside:
The ﬁle passed as argument: contains a 16-byte key
msncf.dat: Encrypted conﬁguration data
msndll.tmp: Encrypted Fallchill loader
msndll.dat: Encrypted Fallchill backdoor (payload for the loader)
[service]svc.dll: Fallchill backdoor loader
[service].dat: Copy of msndll.dat
A mix of the above-mentioned ﬁles produces the ﬁnal backdoor known as Fallchill. A more detailed
procedure for technical specialists is as follows:
1. Check whether the command-line argument points to a ﬁle of 16 byte size.
2. Read the ﬁle passed via the command-line argument. The contents of this ﬁle contains a crypto key,
which we will call the main key.
3. Open the msncf.dat ﬁle (conﬁguration ﬁle). If the ﬁle size equals 192 bytes, read the content of the ﬁle.
4. Open msndll.tmp ﬁle and decrypt it using the main key.
5. Create the [service]svc.dll ﬁle and ﬁll it with pseudo-random data.

1. The malware ﬁlls the ﬁle with 10,240 bytes of pseudo-random data, and iterates (rand() % 10 +
10240) times. This is why it produces ﬁles which are at least 104,851,000 bytes.
6. Copy the 16-byte main key at the end of the [service]svc.dll ﬁle.
7. Encrypt the [service].dat ﬁle name with the main key and append it at the end of [service]svc.dll.
8. Overwrite the beginning of [service]svc.dll with data decrypted from msndll.tmp.
9. Move msndll.dat ﬁle to [service].dat.
10. Delete temporary ﬁles: msndll.tmp, msncf.dat, msndll.log.
11. Timestamp [service]svc.dll and [service].dat ﬁles.
12. Register [service]svc.dll as a Windows service.
13. Save a copy of data from msncf.dat ﬁle in the following registry value
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\TaskConﬁgs\Description.

Data at the end of the loader module
After decryption of the last 260-bytes, the malware retrieves the name or path of the ﬁle that contains the
actual backdoor body in encrypted form.

Decrypted ﬁle name in the end of loader module
The malware reads the speciﬁed ﬁle and decrypts it using the same decryption routine. This is how the
executable code of the backdoor is produced in memory and executed by the loader. Below is the meta

Loading the Fallchill backdoor
As mentioned previously, the ﬁnal payload belongs to a Fallchill malware cluster formerly attributed to the
Lazarus APT group. Upon launching, this malware resolves the API function addresses at runtime, and reads
the C2 server address from the registry value created during the installation stage:
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\TaskConﬁgs\Description
If there is no conﬁguration value, the malware falls back to a default C2 server address.

This is a full-featured backdoor that contains enough functions to fully control the infected host. Some of
its network protocol commands are described below.

While working on the incident of the cryptocurrency company’s breach, we were curious about the legal
status of the Celas LLC company that developed this trojanized trading application.

Celas LLC main homepage.
The website had a valid SSL certiﬁcate issued by Comodo CA. However, note that the certiﬁcate from this
webserver mentions “Domain Control Validated”, which is a weak security veriﬁcation level for a webserver.
It does not mean validation of the identity of the website’s owner, nor of the actual existence of the
business. When certiﬁcation authorities issue this kind of certiﬁcate they only check that the owner has a
certain control over the domain name, which can be abused in certain ways.

It looks at ﬁrst sight like a legitimate WHOIS record, but something doesn’t really add up here. The domain
celasllc.com was the only domain registered with this email address and was exclusively used for domain
registration.
The registrant used the Domain4Bitcoins service to register this domain, apparently paying with
cryptocurrency. According to open-source intelligence, the address of the WHOIS information is fake,
unless it’s the owner of a ramen shop running a cryptocurrency exchange software development studio on
the side.

WHOIS record of cellasllc.com server
Coincidentally, the Fallchill malware authors also preferred to use the same hosting company to host their
C2 server. Moreover, the Celas LLC web server and one of the C2 servers of the Fallchill malware are located
in the same network segment of this ISP:

Real estate history of that address
Pivoting the infrastructure a little further brings up some more suspicious things. It appears that the domain
referred to two IPs, one of which was linked to a few other suspicious domains, according to PassiveDNS.

Cellas LLC linked infrastructure
The owners of the linked infrastructural elements preferred to use several interesting services for hosting
domain registration. All these service providers oﬀer a certain level of anonymity to their customers. Most of
them accept Bitcoins as a main payment method to keep their customers anonymous. This is very
uncommon for companies running a legitimate business.

All the facts above can make the more sceptical among us doubt the intentions of Celas LLC and the

Attribution
Kaspersky Lab has previously attributed the Fallchill malware cluster to Lazarus group when it attacked the
ﬁnancial sector around the world. It was also conﬁrmed by other security vendors, and the national CERT of
US.

RC4 key from the older Fallchill
Fallchill malware uses a RC4 algorithm with a 16-byte key to protect its communications. The key extracted
from the Fallchill variant used in the current attack is DA E1 61 FF 0C 27 95 87 17 57 A4 D6 EA E3 82 2B.

Current RC4 key of Fallchill
We were able to conﬁrm that some of older Fallchill malware variants used exactly the same RC4 key.
Below are Fallchill malware samples that used the same key (the compilation timestamp may indicate the
date of malware creation).

We have conﬁrmed that the C2 server addresses (196.38.48[.]121, 185.142.236[.]226) used in this attack have
been used by the older variant of Fallchill.

Overlap of C2 infrastructure
Apparently, the attackers using the Fallchill malware continue to reuse code and C2 server infrastructure
over and over again.
According to Kaspersky Security Network, Fallchill was not the only malware used in this attack. There was
another backdoor that was used by the threat actor. We omit a full description of this backdoor in the
current report to keep the write-up to an acceptable length, but we would like to highlight two important
things discovered in it. First, this backdoor was created on 2018-07-12 and revealed an already familiar
directory, “TManager”, which we previously saw in the Updater.exe application from the Cellas Trading Pro
suite:

Second, what is probably one of the most interesting ﬁndings to come from this additional backdoor was
discovered hidden in hardcoded headers used to communicate with C2 server. The Accept-Language HTTP
header string revealed a language code associated with North Korea. In our experience, this is something
we normally don’t see in malware.
Accept-Language: ko-kp,ko-kr;q=0.8,ko;q=0.6,en-us;q=0.4,en;q=0.2

Accept-Language HTTP header value in the body of the backdoor

Conclusions
The Lazarus APT group’s continuous attacks on the ﬁnancial sector are not much of a surprise to anyone. A
lot of research has been done and published about such attacks. However, we think this case makes a
diﬀerence. Recent investigation shows how aggressive the group is and how its strategies may evolve in the
future.
First of all, Lazarus group has entered a new platform: macOS. There is steadily growing interest in macOS
from ordinary users, especially in IT companies. Many developers and engineers are switching to using
macOS. Apparently, in the chase after advanced users, software developers from supply chains and some
high proﬁle targets, threat actors are forced to have macOS malware tools. We believe that in the future
Lazarus is going to support all platforms that software developers are using as a base platform, because
compromising developers opens many doors at once.

We cannot say with full certainty whether Celas LLC was compromised and the threat actor abused it to
push malware through an update mechanism. However, the multiple successful Lazarus attempts to
compromise supply chain companies suggest that it will keep exploring this infection method. From all
angles, the Celas LLC story looks like the threat actor has found an elaborate way to create a legitimate
looking business and inject a malicious payload into a “legitimate looking” software update mechanism.
Sounds logical: if one cannot compromise a supply chain, why not to make fake one?
This should be a lesson to all of us and a wake-up call to businesses relying on third-party software. Do not
automatically trust the code running on your systems. Neither good looking website, nor solid company
proﬁle nor the digital certiﬁcates guarantee the absence of backdoors. Trust has to be earned and proven.
Stay safe!
