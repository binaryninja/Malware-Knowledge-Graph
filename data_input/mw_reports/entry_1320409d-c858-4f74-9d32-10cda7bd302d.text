When handling an incident, FortiGuard Labs security researchers noticed that Trickbot had
begun to deploy Conti and Diavol ransomware in the same attack. According to the
researchers, Conti and Diavol had striking similarities including:
“The two ransomware families’… use of asynchronous I/O operations for file encryption
queuing to using virtually identical command-line parameters for the same functionality (i.e.,
logging, drives and network shares encryption, network scanning).”
Despite the similarities, there is no direct connection that the Trickbot gang developed
Diavol like Conti and Ryuk. Because Trickbot is used for access as a service for ransomware
gangs it is affiliated with, the connection between Diavol and the Trickbot gang cannot be
assumed, but from a practical defense perspective, organizations should continue to focus
efforts on detecting Trickbot, Cobalt Strike, and domain profiling reconnaissance methods
used prior to ransomware deployment.
