ZooPark is a cyberespionage operation that has been focusing on Middle Eastern targets since at
least June 2015. T he threat actors behind the operation infect Android devices using several
generations of malware, with the attackers including new features in each iteration. We label them
from v1-v4, with v4 being the most recent version deployed in 2017 . From the technical point of view,
the evolution of ZooPark has shown notable progress: from the very basic first and second versions,
the commercial spyware fork in its third version and then to the complex spyware that is version 4.
T his last step is especially interesting, showing a big leap from straightforward code functionality to
highly sophisticated malware.

We have observed two main distribution vectors for ZooPark – T elegram channels and watering
holes. T he second one was the preferred vector: we found several news websites that have been
hacked by the attackers to redirect visitors to a downloading site that serves malicious APKs. Some
of the themes observed in campaign include “Kurdistan referendum”, “T elegramGroups” and
“Alnaharegypt news”, among others.

T arget profile has evolved during the last years of campaign, focusing on victims in Egypt, Jordan,
Morocco, Lebanon and Iran.
