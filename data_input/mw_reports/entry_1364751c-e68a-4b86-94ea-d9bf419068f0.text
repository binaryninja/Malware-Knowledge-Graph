What is
Magecart?

Also known as digital skimming, this crime has surged since 2015. Criminals steal
card data during online shopping. Who are behind these notorious hacks, how does it
work, and how have Magecart attacks evolved over time?
About Magecart
While an international retail chain closed its physical stores, attackers hacked its online
presence, Sansec research shows. Following common Magecart malpractice, payment
skimmers were injected and used to steal customer data and cards.

Timeline
Claire’s, a fashion retailer, closed all of its 3000 brick & mortar stores worldwide on March
20th. The next day, the domain claires-assets.com was registered by an anonymous
party:
Domain Name: CLAIRES-ASSETS.COM
Registrar URL: http://www.namecheap.com
Creation Date: 2020-03-21T21:26:17Z
Registrant Name: WhoisGuard Protected

For the next 4 weeks, Sansec did not observe suspicious activity. But in the last week of
April, malicious code was added to the online stores of Claire’s and its sister brand Icing.
The injected code would intercept any customer information that was entered during
checkout, and send it to the claires-assets.com server. The malware was present until
June 13th.

Analysis of the __preloader skimmer
The malware was added to the (otherwise legitimate) app.min.js file. This file is hosted
on the store servers, so there is no “Supply Chain Attack” involved, and attackers have
actually gained write access to the store code. Here is the heavily obfuscated copy:

Decoding this reveals the following malware:

The skimmer attaches to the submit button of the checkout form. Upon clicking, the full
“Demandware Checkout Form” is grabbed, serialized and base64 encoded. A temporary
image is added to the DOM with the __preloader identifier. The image is located on the
server as controlled by the attacker. Because all of the customer submitted data is
appended to the image address, the attacker now has received the full payload.
Immediately, the image element is removed.
We suspect that attackers have deliberately chosen an image file for exfiltration, because
image requests are not always monitored by security systems.
A sample exfiltration request, containing the base64 encoded customer payment data,
looks like this:

Comments
The timeline may indicate that attackers anticipated a surge in online traffic following the
lockdown. The period between exfil domain registration and actual malware suggests that it
took the attackers a good 4 weeks to gain access to the store.
The actual root cause is as of yet unknown. Possible causes are leaked admin credentials,
spearphishing of staff members and/or a compromised internal network.

Magecart & Salesforce Commerce Cloud
The affected stores are hosted on the Salesforce Commerce Cloud, previously known as
Demandware. This is a hosted eCommerce platform that serves some of the biggest stores
globally. While the actual root cause is yet unknown, it is unlikely that the Salesforce
platform got breached or that Salesforce is responsible for this incident.

Sansec monitors all global eCommerce platforms for security incidents. Previously
compromised stores that use the Salesforce platform are UK outlet Sweaty Betty in
November and Hanna Andersson in September.

Claire’s response
After we notified them, Claire’s management has quickly responded. They let us know:
Claire’s cares about protecting its customers’ data. On Friday, we identified an issue
related to our e-commerce platform and took immediate action to investigate and
address it. Our investigation identified the unauthorized insertion of code to our ecommerce platform designed to obtain payment card data entered by customers
during the checkout process. We removed that code and have taken additional
measures to reinforce the security of our platform. We are working diligently to
determine the transactions that were involved so that we can notify those individuals.
Cards used in our retail stores were not affected by this issue. We have also notified
the payment card networks and law enforcement. It is always advisable for
cardholders to monitor their account statements for unauthorized charges. The
payment card network rules generally provide that cardholders are not responsible for
unauthorized charges that are timely reported.
