Operation Poisoned Hurricane
Introduction
Our worldwide sensor network provides researchers at FireEye Labs with unique opportunities to detect
innovative tactics employed by malicious actors and protects our clients from these tactics. We recently
uncovered a coordinated campaign targeting Internet infrastructure providers, a media organization, a
financial services company, and an Asian government organization. The actor responsible for this
campaign utilized legitimate digital certificates to sign their tools and employed innovative techniques to
cloak their command and control traffic.
Hurricane Electric Redirection
In March of 2014, we detected Kaba (aka PlugX or SOGU) callback traffic to legitimate domains and IP
addresses. Our initial conclusion was that this traffic was the result of malicious actors
‘sleeping’ their implants, by pointing their command and control domains at legitimate IP
addresses. As this is a popular technique, we did not think much of this traffic at the time.
Further analysis revealed that the HTTP headers of the traffic in question contained a Host: entry for
legitimate domains. As we have previously observed malware families that forge their HTTP headers to
include legitimate domains in callback traffic, we concluded that the malware in this case was configured
in the same way.
An example of the observed traffic is as follows:
POST /C542BB084F927229348B2A34 HTTP/1.1
Accept: */*
CG100: 0
CG103: 0
CG107: 61456
CG108: 1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; SLCC2; .NET CLR

.NET4.0C)
Host: www.adobe.com
Content-Length: 0
Cache-Control: no-cache
As we continued to see this odd traffic throughout the summer we began a search for malware samples

responsible for this behavior. Via this research, we found a malware sample that we believe was
responsible for at least some of the strange traffic that we had observed. The identified sample had the
following properties:
MD5: 52d2d1ab9b84303a585fb81e927b9e01
Size: 180296
Compile Time: 2013-10-15 05:17:37

RT_VERSION: 9dd9b7c184069135c23560f8fbaa829adc7af6d2047cf5742b5a1e7c5c923cb9
This sample was signed with a legitimate digital certificate from the ‘Police Mutual Aid Association’. This
certificate has a serial number of ‘06 55 69 a3 e2 61 40 91 28 a4 0a ff a9 0d 6d 10’.
Analysis of this Kaba sample revealed that it was configured to directly connect to both www.adobe.com
and update.adobe.com. Obviously, this configuration does not make a lot of sense, as the actor would not
be able to control their implants from anywhere on the Internet since they did not have direct control over
these domains – unless the attackers were able to re-route traffic destined for these domains
from specific victims. Indeed, further analysis of this Kaba variant revealed that it was also configured
to use specific DNS resolvers. This sample was configured to resolve DNS lookups via Hurricane
Electric’s nameservers of 216.218.130.2, 216.218.131.2, 216.218.132.2 and 216.66.1.2.
We found this interesting, so we investigated how these Hurricane Electric’s nameservers were
configured. Subsequently, we found that anyone could register for a free account with
Hurricane Electric’s hosted DNS service. Via this service, anyone with an account was able to
register a zone and create A records for the registered zone and point those A records to any IP address
they so desired. The dangerous aspect of this service is that anyone was able to hijack
legitimate domains such as adobe.com. Although these nameservers are not recursors and
were not designed to be queried directly by end users, they were returning results if
queried directly for domains that were configured via Hurricane Electrics public DNS
service. Furthermore, Hurricane Electric did not check if zones created by their users were
already been registered or are otherwise legitimately owned by other parties.
As we continued this research, we identified 21 legitimate fully qualified domain names that had been

hijacked via this technique by at least one APT actor. In addition to the adobe.com domain mentioned
above, another one of the poisoned domains is www.outlook.com. A lookup of this domain via Google’s
DNS resolvers returns expected results:
$ dig +short @8.8.8.8 www.outlook.com
www.outlook.com.glbdns2.microsoft.com.
www-nameast.outlook.com.

157.56.232.182
157.56.241.118
157.56.240.22
A quick lookup of these addresses reveal that Microsoft owns them:

However, as recently as August 4, 2014 a lookup of the same www.outlook.com domain via Hurricane
Electric’s resolvers returned entirely different results[1]:

Additional researched uncovered more Kaba samples that were configured to leverage Hurricane Electric’s
public DNS resolvers. Another sample has the following properties:

This sample is signed with a recently expired digital certificate from ‘MOCOMSYS INC’. This certificate
has a serial number of ‘03 e5 a0 10 b0 5c 92 87 f8 23 c2 58 5f 54 7b 80’.
This sample used Hurricane Electric’s public DNS resolvers to route traffic to the hijacked domains of
www.adobe.com and update.adobe.com. We also noted that this sample was configured to connect directly
to 59.125.42.168 – one IP address away from the IP that received traffic from the hijacked
www.outlook.com domain.
Passive DNS research revealed that this IP hosted the same set of known APT domains listed above:

While this problem does not directly impact users of www.adobe.com, www.outlook.com, or users of the
other affected domains, it should not be dismissed as inconsequential. Actors that adopt this tactic
and obfuscate the destination of their traffic through localized DNS hijacks can
significantly complicate the job of network defenders.
Via our sensor network, we observed the actor responsible for this activity conducting a focused campaign.
We observed this actor target:
Multiple Internet Infrastructure Service Providers in Asia and the United States
A Media Organization based in the United States
A financial institution based in Asia
An Asian government organization
Google Code Command and Control
Furthermore, we also discovered this same actor conducting a parallel campaign that leveraged Google
Code for command and control. On August 1, 2014 we observed a malicious self-extracting executable (aka
sfxrar) file downloaded from 211.125.81.203. This file had the following properties:
MD5: 17bc9d2a640da75db6cbb66e5898feb1
Size: 282800 bytes
A valid certificate from ‘QTI INTERNATIONAL INC’ was used to sign this sfxrar. This certificate had a
serial number of ‘2e df b9 fd cf a0 0c cb 5a b0 09 ee 3a db 97 b9’. The sfxrar contained
the following files:
File
msi.dll
msi.dll.dat
setup.exe

11680
115218

MD5
029c8f56dd89ceeaf928c3148d13eba7

d00b3169f45e74bb22a1cd684341b14a

Setup.exe is a legitimate executable from Kaspersky used to load the Kaba (aka PlugX) files – msi.dll and
msi.dll.dat.
These Kaba files are configured to connect to Google Code – specifically code.google.com/p/udom/. On
August 1, this Google Code project contained the encoded command
“DZKSGAAALLBACDCDCDOCBDCDCDOCCDADIDOCBDADDZJS”.[2]

These Kaba files are configured to connect to Google Code – specifically code.google.com/p/udom/. On
August 1, this Google Code project contained the encoded command
“DZKSGAAALLBACDCDCDOCBDCDCDOCCDADIDOCBDADDZJS”.
def NewPlugx_C2_redir_decode(s):
rvalue = “”
for x in range(0, len(s), 2):
tmp0 = (ord(s[x+1]) – 0×41) << 4
rvalue += chr(ord(s[x]) + tmp0 – 0×41) return rvalue
The command ‘DZKSGAAALLBACDCDCDOCBDCDCDOCCDADIDOCBDADDZJS’ decodes to
222.122.208.10. In a live environment, the Kaba implant would then connect to this IP
address via UDP.
Further analysis of project at code.google.com/p/udom/ revealed the project owner, 0x916ftb691u,
created a number of other projects. We decoded the commands hosted at these linked projects and found
that they issued the following decoded commands:
112.175.143.22
59.125.42.167
153.121.57.213
61.82.71.10
202.181.133.169

112.175.143.16
222.122.208.9
27.122.13.204
It is likely that other yet to be discovered Kaba variants are configured to connect to these
related Google Code projects and then redirect to this list of IP addresses.
Passive DNS analysis of these IP addresses revealed connections to the following known malicious
infrastructure:

As mentioned above the Kaba variant eae0391e92a913e757ac78b14a6f079f shared a common import hash
of f749528b1db6fe5aee61970813c7bc18 with many of the samples listed in this post. This samples was to
use Hurricane Electric’s nameservers as well as connect directly to the IP address 59.125.42.168.
Note that we identified the same C2 IP 59.125.42.168 via our analysis of the malicious Google Code
projects. Specifically, the Google Project at code.google.com/p/tempzz/, which is linked to the project at
code.google.com/p/udom/, issued an encoded command that decoded to 59.125.42.168.
We also identified another related Kaba variant that connected to code.google.com/p/updata-server. This
variant had the following properties:

Conclusion
These coordinated campaigns demonstrate that APT actors are determined to continue operations. As
computer network defenders increase their capabilities to identify and block these campaigns by
deploying more advanced detection technologies, threat actors will continue to adopt creative evasion
techniques.
We observed the following evasion techniques in these campaigns:
The use of legitimate digital certificates to sign malware
The use of Hurricane Electrics public DNS resolvers to redirect command and control traffic
The use of Google Code to obfuscate the location of command and control servers
While none of these techniques are necessarily new, in combination, they are certainly
both creative and have been observed to be effective. Although the resultant C2 traffic can be
successfully detected and tracked, the fact that the malware appears to beacon to legitimate
domains may lull defenders into a false sense of security. Network defenders should continue to
study the evolution of advanced threat actors, as these adversaries will continue to evolve in pursuit of
their designated objectives.
