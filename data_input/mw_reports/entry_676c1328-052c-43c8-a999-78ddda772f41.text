Overview
Recently, an XLSM decoy document is captured by the RedDrip team of QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Center by utilizing public intelligence. After taking a
deeper analysis, we ﬁgure out that the C2 conﬁgurations are located on Github and Feed43. Multiple Github spaces have been exposed through correlation
analysis and the earliest one could trace back to July 2018. The relevant accounts were still in use when the report was completed.
Decryption algorithm for conﬁgurations retrieved from Github will be described in detail and the portrait of the attacker is partially based on statistics of the
decrypted data.

Sample Analysis
The related attack vector is an XLSM ﬁle, created on August 8 and uploaded to VT on August 13, that leverages CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability to release
MSBuild.exe to the %AppData% directory and then add registry Run key to stay persistent. To obtain C2 address, it reads data from Github and Feed43 where
the content could be controlled by attackers. HTTP/HTTPS protocols are used while communicating with available C2s.

Dropper Analysis
The sample was uploaded to VT at 5:05 on Aug 13, 2019 with below details:
MD5

0D38ADC0B048BAB3BD91861D42CD39DF

Name

India makes Kashmir Dangerous Place in the World.xlsm

Time

2019-08-13 05:05:15

After opening, a blurred picture shows up to lure the victim to enable macro. After that, a clear picture titled "India has made Kashmir the most dangerous place
in the world" gets displayed.

Figure 2.1 Images before and after enabling macro
In fact, the clear picture is covered with a vague one. When macro is enabled, the above picture will be deleted so that the clear one will be displayed:

Figure 2.2 Content of the macro
There is an OLE object embedded inside, and it seems that the attacker packed the .bak ﬁle by mistake:

Figure 2.3 The ole objects packed inside
Shellcode inside the OLE object performs below functions:
1.Correct the MZ header located at offset 0x558 of the shellcode entry point (add “MZ”)
2.Drop the PE ﬁle to "%AppData%\MSBuild.exe".
3.Add registry run key (key value: lollipop) to make "%AppData%\MSBuild.exe" persistent.

Figure 2.4 Shellcode to correct the header

MSBuild.exe Analysis
MSBuild.exe is released to the %AppData% directory, and the compilation time is August 8th, 2019 which coincides with the XML creation time on Github that
will be described later on:
Name

MSBuild.exe

Compile Time

The main purpose of this sample is to obtain C2 conﬁguration from the attacker's Github and feed43 space, and then performs decryption and connects to C2
for further communications.
After the malicious code is executed, it will “sleep” for a period of time. This is implemented by executing function in a loop for 80,000 times, to delay execution
in the sandbox:

Figure 3.1 Executing function in a big loop to achieve sleep purpose
It checks network connectivity by connecting to “https://en.wikipedia.org", then retrieves C2 conﬁguration from two hard coded addresses (one works as a
backup). The hard coded address is encrypted, each byte need to be subtracted by one to obtain the decrypted URL:

The Github account used by the attacker is created on August 7th, 2019, which matches the compilation time of the sample:

The C2 conﬁguration is located inside the “description” ﬁeld after encryption:

The Base64 encoded data get decoded ﬁrst, then performs ROL1((v11 + 16 * v9) ^ 0x23, 3) operation. After that, Base64 decode again and ﬁnally uses
Blowﬁsh (older version without Blowﬁsh decryption) by decryption key below:

The decrypted C2 address is 139.28.38.236 and the malware uses HTTP/HTTPS in network communication:

Data Analysis
After performing correlation analysis, we discovered 44 conﬁguration ﬁles hosted on Github and utilized by this APT group. All C2s have been decrypted and
extracted for investigation. From the time of ﬁle creation, the attacker started working at least as early as July 2018. The earliest created account was on July
3, 2018, and continued to August 2019 when the document was completed. In terms of the statistics of monthly creations, the number of creations in July 2018
is much higher than the follow-up. We give the following reasonable speculations based on the data distribution.
The attacker may conduct a concentrated attack from July to September in 2018.
Accounts are created on demand when the sample gets updated or related Github link is blocked.

Figure 4.1 Conﬁguration ﬁle distribution
Some extracted Github user names are listed as follows. We found that the names are generated based on some family names. So the attacks may be
completed by multiple attackers considering the different names being used. Many IDs can be found on social media, and most of them are located in
India and Pakistan:

Keywords such as “android” and “mobile” are used in the Github directory, perhaps it indicates there are samples for Android phones.

Conclusion
The link to feeds.rapidfeeds.com left in its XML conﬁguration ﬁle was also mentioned by Kaspersky’s report in the reference section, which conﬁrms that the
APT-C-09 group keeps updating its C2 conﬁguration channel and the recent one reserves some past features.
In the perspective of cyber wars, the conﬂict between India and Pakistan over the territory of Kashmir has lasted for decades, which makes it a perfect topic in
target attacks. For example, Donot and Bitter disguised as Kashmiri Voice to attack Pakistan, Transparent Tribe attacked India with decoy document regarding
terrorist attacks in Kashmir. These combats have proved that national power plays an important role in defending the national sovereignty and in the mean
while spying on the military intelligence.
India’s attempt to abolish India-controlled Kashmir is to detonate the conﬂict between the two countries. The two sides exchanged ﬁre and some soldiers have
died because of this. In terms of cyber attacks, related incidences will continue to rise up. Considering APT-C-09, Bitter and Donot have carried out targeted
attacks against China, we must take actions in advance and keep a close eye on their recent activities.
QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Center will provide customers with the latest attack trends in the ﬁrst time, helping government and enterprises to resist network
intrusions from foreign enemies.
