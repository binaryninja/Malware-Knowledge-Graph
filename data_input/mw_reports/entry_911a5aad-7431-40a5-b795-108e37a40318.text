Meet CrowdStrike’s Adversary of the Month for August: GOBLIN
PANDA
August 29, 2018
Adam Meyers Research & Threat Intel

CrowdStrike® first observed GOBLIN PANDA activity in September 2013 when
indicators of its activity were discovered on the network of a technology company operating
in multiple sectors.
Malware variants primarily used by this actor include PlugX and HttpTunnel. This actor
focuses a significant amount of its targeting activity on entities in Southeast Asia,
particularly Vietnam. Heavy activity was observed in the late spring and early summer of
2014 when tensions between China and other Southeast Asian nations were high, due to
conflict over territory in the South China Sea. GOBLIN PANDA targets have been
primarily observed in the defense, energy, and government sectors.
Last month, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed renewed activity from GOBLIN PANDA
targeting Vietnam. As part of this campaign, new exploit documents were identified with
Vietnamese-language lures and themes, as well as Vietnam-themed, adversary-controlled

infrastructure.
Two exploit documents with Vietnamese-language file names were observed with file
metadata unique to the GOBLIN PANDA adversary. Decoy content displayed in these
incidents used Vietnamese-language Microsoft Office Word documents with training-related
themes. These documents did not specifically reference Vietnamese government projects
or departments, however they could still be directed towards Government of Vietnam
personnel.
When opened, both documents use CVE-2012-0158 exploit code to drop malicious files
associated with a previously identified side-loading malware implant, tracked as QCRat by
CrowdStrike Falcon® Intelligence™.
Both exploit documents used a previously identified legitimate executable, and a sideloading implant Dynamic Link Library (DLL), as well as new implant configuration files
stored as a .tlb file.
Analysis of command and control infrastructure suggests that GOBLIN PANDA is targeting
entities in Laos, as well. CrowdStrike Intelligence has not directly observed Laotian
targeting, and cannot confirm targets in Laos for this campaign, however, previous activity
linked to GOBLIN PANDA has targeted this country.
Given major economic initiatives by China, such as the Belt and Road Initiative and
continued dispute over the Paracel Islands, it is unlikely that GOBLIN PANDA will abandon
efforts to collect intelligence from South East Asian neighbors and businesses operating in
that region.
There are no known community or industry names associated with this actor.
