Executive Summary:
On June 11, 2021, Avaddon ransomware responsible for numerous cyber incidents
since 2020 made a decision to not only suspend their operations but provide decryption
keys for all the victims who were targeted by them.

AdvIntel was able to achieve unmatched visibility into the Avaddon victimology by
obtaining their Master Key information. This visibility into all victims of the group (and
not only companies whose data was officially dumped on Avaddon’s shame blog)
enabled unique insights into Avadon’s patterns, strategies, and methods.
Through investigating victimology, AdvIntel assessed that the total income made by
one operator through the year of Avaddon activities could potentially equal 1,000
Russian median salaries which explains the foundation of ransonomics and why it
attracts more and more talented individuals in Russia and other states.
According to unique AdvIntel findings obtained through exhaustive investigations of the
Russian-speaking underground cybercrime community, Avaddon demise was likely
caused by political reasons - a sharp reaction of the US presidential administration on
the recent ransomware attacks, and the subsequent pressure applied by Russian law
enforcement against local cybercrime groups prior to the upcoming Bide-Putin summit.
Introduction - The Lost Empire

The three-letter Hebrew root “avad” (‫)אבד‬, from which the name is Avaddon derived, has two
main semantic interpretations- “to destroy” and “to lose / get lost”. Indeed, these two
meanings perfectly define the Avaddon ransomware - a destructive and malicious force which always managed to conceal itself and disappear.

Today we shed light on this lost and hidden criminal empire using unique datasets - the full
list of Avaddon victims ever targeted by the group over the year of its existence - discovered
by AdvIntel. This unique SIGINT data is supported by exclusive HUMINT findings statements made by the Eastern-European underground cybercommunity leaders who
worked with Avaddon - explaining and interpreting the groups’ rapid rise and even more
rapid downfall.

Avaddon & The Birth of “Ransonomics”

On June 11, 2021, Avaddon released keys for over 2,000 victims containing the exact
company breach names.

Our analysis of the confirmed victimology shows that some of them were the world’s leading
companies. How did this group succeed in hitting so many companies within a year? The
answer is - Avaddon created an entire ecosystem around themselves - a web of supply
chains, international affiliates, sellers, underground auction managers, and negotiators. They
have established an organic ecosystem of criminal extortion economy - a form of
“ransonomics.”

Of course, Avaddon was not the only group pursuing a diversified approach to building a
larger business system. However, they were likely the most creative ones. They were the
only Russian-speaking group that enabled but promoted international partners joining the
team as affiliates that directly represented the coverage of Avaddon’s attacks, reaching five
continents.

Avaddon operations targeted companies and governments all across the globe, with the
exception of Russia
One of Avaddon’s largest attacks - on a major financial institution occurring in May 2021 illustrates this integrated approach of building the ransomware-attacks economy.

While investigating the attack first, we discovered 141 unique indicators for RDP
compromises for the victim's domain. This means that Avaddon was using the services of
an RDP brute-forcing group. Moreover, two weeks before the attack, a threat actor
conveniently published a post on a major underground forum where Avaddon was based,
auctioning classified information on the future victim. This access seller happened to be
connected to a malware developer specializing in data exfiltration tools. In other words,
before Avaddon performed their data-stealing operation, they were able to utilize the entirety
of underground services and purchase the full set - RDP access, direct network access, and
malware for data exfiltration.

Victimology - Key to Understanding the Adversary

4/12

This innovative approach enabled Avaddon to perform several thousand attacks. AdvIntel
has analyzed Avaddon’s victim’s unique datasets to build the most definitive adversarial
profile.

Traditionally, while profiling the group’s victimology, companies rely on the data available in
public - i.e. ransomware websites. And indeed, even looking at this partial data, which only
includes companies whose information was dumped on the shame blogs, we can see that
Avaddon played a major role in the threat landscape.

by Avaddon group on the syndicate’s shame blog

However, the victims whose names were published on the shame blog are only the tip of the
iceberg. AdvIntel’s advanced dataset, covering all Avaddon victims, provides further
visibility into the gang’s operations.

For this statistical research, AdvIntel has selected a special high-value-target dataset. First,
we identified the industries which were the primary targets of the group - manufacturing,
retail, technology, and engineering being the most preferred sectors most likely because, for
the companies in these sectors, even a brief interruption of businesses can imply fatal
consequences.

For the next step, we performed market research of the victims’ revenue to identify the
potential pattern of Avaddon attacks.

The total revenue of all victims was around $35 Billion USD. This number is essentially the
segment of the market which has been in one way or another threatened by Avaddon
malicious operations.

Avaddon’s victims can be divided into three categories - small, medium, and large.
The average victim revenue was:
$13 Million USD for small businesses
$287 Million USD for medium-sized victims
$3.7 Billion USD for larger businesses

Avaddon ransomware victims by revenue

Ransonomics: Avaddon Ransomware Profits

Our next research goal was to calculate how much money the Avaddon group could
make before their rapid retirement. We have utilized our previous knowledge from threat
actor engagements to develop realistic formulas of ransom demand calculations supported
by the actual Avaddon cases.

Traditionally, all Russian-speaking actors are using the victims’ annual revenue to calculate
the ransom. After identifying the revenue, they investigate the sector within which the victim
operates. The most common calculation which according to our sensitive and credible
source intelligence as used by Avaddon was a so-called “5x5” rule when 5% of the annual
revenue is used to start the negotiations, with annual revenue estimated as one-fifth of the
total revenue. In other words, for a victim which has a total revenue of $7 Million USD, the
starting ransom price will be $70,000 USD. Typically, Avaddon dropped the price during the
bargaining, and the end ransom was around $50,000 USD for a successful operation.

However, not all companies out of the two thousand victim list were forced to pay such
ransom. In many cases, the negotiation failed or the ransom was minimal - several thousand
USD (especially in the very beginning). At the same time, bigger payments were demanded
7/12

from larger entities. Here, the “5x5” formula, however, was replaced by a more adequate
scale for larger ransom involving 0,01% margins for annual revenue instead of 5%, etc. For a
multi-billion dollar company, the demand was constrained by a few million dollars.
In other words, in one year of ransomware development, an Avaddon member made
the same amount of money as an average Russian would make in a millennium - the
best illustration of how lucrative ransomware could be for the region.
After finalizing all the calculations with a case-by-case study of each victim from the highvalue dataset, AdvIntel assessed that the bulk of ransom payments came from over a
thousand smaller-sized companies, which were demanded between $30,000 to $70,000
USD and constituted the overall payment of $55 million to Avaddon. Over 500 larger
businesses in the victim list constituted another $30 million, and the rest was divided
between smaller payments. As such, our total assessment of Avaddon income is
approximately $87 Million USD.

Our team has also attempted to calculate the revenue of a core Avaddon team member
based on these numbers. Within Avaddon RaaS over 70% of income went to affiliates,
therefore, the core team, and especially the leader of Avaddon, received around $26 Million
USD. This number was likely divided between at least four individuals, which made the
approximate annual income (Avaddon existed for a year) $7,000,000 USD. To compare - the
median annual income in Russia is estimated at $7,000 USD.

In other words, in one year of ransomware development, an Avaddon member made the
same amount of money as an average Russian would make in a millennium - the best
illustration of how lucrative ransomware could be for the region.

Avaddon Downfall - Black Mark of Cyber Pirates

If Avaddon was so successful, what could have motivated them to quit? The likely answer is
fear. The US law enforcement and the Biden administration became very upfront regarding
future retaliatory measures against ransomware and the new angle in which ransomware is
seen as essentially an act of terrorism. This new take on digital extortion from the world’s
leading superpower had a direct response within the underground community - the abovementioned ransonomics - a carefully and meticulously built web of alliances and supply
chains - started to rapidly fail.

8/12

Software brokers refused to sell malware to ransomware groups, forums banned RaaS
partnerships, and affiliates were left without means and services to disseminate the payload.
The cybercrime world was always similar to piracy and it has its own “black mark” - a
deadly stigma sign - after Colonial Pipeline, ransomware got this sign on itself. Avaddon,
which was in the center of the dynamic and turbulent ransomware ecosystem, quickly
realized the risks they may face.

When Politics Meets Cybercrime

This realization was likely caused by the recent intervention of politics into the cybercrime
domain. Overall, the inner logic of the Russian security landscape presumes that a
successful cyber group will at some point become prominent enough to attract the state’s
attention. Usually, law enforcement will turn a blind eye to cyber operations unless these
operations target Russian citizens or businesses. However, this status quo has changed in
May 2021.

After the admin of the largest XSS forum called for a ransomware ban justifying it for political
reasons, the community of digital extortionists in Russia was observed to go through stages
of paranoia. This was only supported by multiple statements made in the last three months
by the Russian government, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and by President Putin
personally about establishing an international Russian-American initiative to establish a
joint cybersecurity landscape. The Russian officials likely see this as a tool of de-escalating
the US-Russian relationships, especially in the light of the upcoming Biden/Putin summit
scheduled for June 16, 2021.

Indeed, the Russian government traditionally goes through rounds of escalation and
deescalation with the West. The escalation phase involving military maneuvers in the
proximity of the Russia-Ukraine border and in Northern Syria ended in April 2021. Now the
Kremlin aiming to address severe challenges of the post-covid economic recession and the
turbulent domestic situation is interested in creating a certain framework of stability in the
international arena and ensuring stabilized relationships with the US to avoid unnecessary
pressure. Cybersecurity - a controversial space or the Russia-US relationship is on the
frontlines of this de-escalation agenda.

9/12

It is also noteworthy that some of the jurisdictions targeted by Avaddon - Iran, China, and
Turkey have strong geopolitical ties with Russia and act as Russian allies or critical
economic partners. However, it is unclear if this could have led to any aggravation in the
relationship between Avaddon and the Russian state.

Usually, Russian security apparatus turns a blind eye to cyber operations unless these
operations target Russian citizens or businesses. However, this status quo has
changed in May 2021.

Whatever the true rationale of the Russian politicians calling for international cybersecurity
cooperation is, these recent statements have clearly had an impact on the underground
cybercrime community. AdvIntel has tracked multiple discussions between top-tier actors
working with Avaddon who mentioned that one of the group’s affiliates was apprehended by
the Russian law enforcement on the eve of the US-Russia summit and that further arrests
may follow against the ransomware leaders in order to secure the political landscape.
