Karma is a relatively new ransomware threat actor, having first been observed in June of
2021. The group has targeted numerous organizations across different industries. Reports of
a group with the same name from 2016 are not related to the actors currently using the
name. An initial technical analysis of a single sample related to Karma was published by
researchers from Cyble in August.
In this post, we take a deeper dive, focusing on the evolution of Karma through multiple
versions of the malware appearing through June 2021. In addition, we explore the links
between Karma and other well known malware families such as NEMTY and JSWorm and
offer an expanded list of technical indicators for threat hunters and defenders.

Initial Sample Analysis
Karma’s development has been fairly rapid and regular with updated variants and
improvements, oftentimes building multiple versions on the same day. The first few Karma
samples our team observed were:
Sample 1: d9ede4f71e26f4ccd1cb96ae9e7a4f625f8b97c9
Sample 2: a9367f36c1d2d0eb179fd27814a7ab2deba70197
Sample 3: 9c733872f22c79b35c0e12fa93509d0326c3ec7f

Sample 1 was compiled on 18th, June 2021 and Samples 2 and 3 the following day on the
19th, a few minutes apart. Basic configuration between these samples is similar, though
there are some slight differences such as PDB paths.
After Sample 1, we see more of the core features appear, including the writing of the ransom
note. Upon execution, these payloads would enumerate all local drives (A to Z) , and encrypt
files where possible.
Further hunting revealed a number of other related samples all compiled within a few days of
each other. The following table illustrates compilation timestamps and payload size across
versions of Karma compiled in a single week. Note how the payload size decreases as the
authors’ iterate.

Ransom Note is not Created in Sample 1.
Also, the list of excluded extensions is somewhat larger in Sample 1 than in both Samples 2
and 3, and the list of extensions is further reduced from Sample 5 onwards to only exclude
“.exe”, “.ini”, “.dll”, “.url” and “.lnk”.

Encryption Details
From Sample 2 onwards, the malware calls CreateIoCompletionPort, which is used for
communication between the main thread and a sub thread(s) handling the encryption
process. This specific call is key in managing efficiency of the encryption process
(parallelization in this case).
Individual files are encrypted by way of a random Chacha20 key. Once files are encrypted,
the malware will encrypt the random Chacha20 key with the public ECC key and embed it in
the encrypted file.

Chacha Encryption

Across Samples 2 to 5, the author removed the CreateIoCompletionPort call, instead
opting to create a new thread to manage enumeration and encryption per drive. We also
note the “KARMA” mutex created to prevent the malware from running more than once.
Ransom note names have also been updated to “KARMA-ENCRYPTED.txt”.
Diving in deeper, some samples show that the ChaCha20 algorithm has been swapped out
for Salsa20. The asymmetric algorithm (for ECC) has been swapped from Secp256k1 to
Sect233r1. Some updates around execution began to appear during this time as well, such
as support for command line parameters.
A few changes were noted in Samples 6 and 7. The main difference is the newly included
background image. The file “background.jpg” is written to %TEMP% and set as the Desktop
image/wallpaper for the logged in user.

Malware Similarity Analysis
From our analysis, we see similarities between JSWorm and the associated permutations of
that ransomware family such as NEMTY, Nefilim, and GangBang. Specifically, the Karma
code analyzed bears close similarity to the GangBang or Milihpen variants that appeared
around January 2021.

6/10

Some high-level similarities are visible in the configurations.
We can see deeper relationships when we conduct a bindiff on Karma and GangBang
samples. The following image shows how similar the main() functions are:

Victim Communication
The main body of the ransom note text hasn’t changed since the first sample and still
contains mistakes. The ransom notes are base64-encoded in the binary and dropped on the
victim machine with the filename “KARMA-AGREE.txt” or, in later samples, “KARMAENCRYPTED.txt”.

Your network has been breached by Karma ransomware group.
We have extracted valuable or sensitive data from your network and encrypted the data
on your systems.
Decryption is only possible with a private key that only we posses.
Our group's only aim is to financially benefit from our brief acquaintance,this is a
guarantee that we will do what we promise.
Scamming is just bad for business in this line of work.
Contact us to negotiate the terms of reversing the damage we have done and deleting
the data we have downloaded.
We advise you not to use any data recovery tools without leaving copies of the
initial encrypted file.
You are risking irreversibly damaging the file by doing this.
If we are not contacted or if we do not reach an agreement we will leak your data to
journalists and publish it on our website.

If a ransom is payed we will provide the decryption key and proof that we deleted you
data.
When you contact us we will provide you proof that we can decrypt your files and that
we have downloaded your data.
How to contact us:
{[email protected]}
{[email protected]}
{[email protected]}

Each sample observed offers three contact emails, one for each of the mail providers
onionmail, tutanota, and protonmail. In each sample, the contact emails are unique,
suggesting they are specific communication channels per victim. The notes contain no other
unique ID or victim identifier as sometimes seen in notes used by other ransomware groups.
In common with other operators, however, the Karma ransom demand threatens to leak
victim data if the victim does not pay. The address of a common leaks site where the data will
be published is also given in the note. This website page appears to have been authored in
May 2021 using WordPress.

Conclusion
Karma is a young and hungry ransomware operation. They are aggressive in their targeting,
and show no reluctance in following through with their threats. The apparent similarities to
the JSWorm family are also highly notable as it could be an indicator of the group being
more than they appear. The rapid iteration over recent months suggests the actor is investing
in development and aims to be around for the foreseeable future. SentinelLabs continues to
follow and analyze the development of Karma ransomware.
