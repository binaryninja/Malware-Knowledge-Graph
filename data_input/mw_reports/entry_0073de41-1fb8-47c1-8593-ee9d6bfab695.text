The data in this report was generated on March 2, 2023. Any additions to the CISA KEV
Catalog after that date are not reflected in this report.
In last week’s blog, we looked at the vulnerabilities the Cyber Security & Infrastructure
Agency (CISA) added to the Known Exploited Vulnerability (KEV) Catalog in 2022. In the
report,we mentioned CISA missed some actively exploited vulnerabilities that had been
assigned CVEs in 2022. The KEV Catalog is the driving force for vulnerability management
in the US federal civilian executive branch, and many private companies have adopted it as

1/7

the de facto standard. As such, excluding any exploited-in-the-wild vulnerability is a big deal
with potentially far-reaching effects. This blog will share 42 likely exploited-in-the-wild
vulnerabilities assigned CVEs in 2022 that haven’t been included in the KEV Catalog.

Key Takeaways
VulnCheck identified 42 vulnerabilities that were assigned CVEs in 2022 and reported to
have been, or likely to have been, exploited in the wild that were not added to the CISA
KEV Catalog.
Of the 42 CVEs, an overwhelming majority are related to botnets (64%). However, there are
also a number of ransomware (10%) and threat actor (12%) attributions.
Some missing vulnerabilities, specifically CVE-2016-20016, have been exploited in the wild
since 2017 and still have thousands of potential targets online.
76.2% of the missing vulnerabilities were initial access, which VulnCheck recommends
prioritizing.
The CISA KEV Catalog is undoubtedly helpful and a driving force in our industry. Still, as
long as it’s missing actively exploited vulnerabilities, it cannot be treated as the authoritative
catalog of exploited vulnerabilities.

The Missing Vulnerabilities
Using publicly-available reporting, VulnCheck identified 42 vulnerabilities that were assigned
CVEs in 2022 and reported to have been, or likely to have been, exploited in the wild. The
exploited-in-the-wild sources include a variety of world-class security organizations, including
Talos, ESET Research, Avast, FortiGuard Labs, Rapid7, and more.
The public reporting often tells us who was doing the exploitation: ransomware, botnets,
threat actors, etc. The “who” is essential, as it can change the criticality of a vulnerability. A
vulnerability exploited by ransomware is much more concerning than a vulnerability exploited
by a Mirai botnet. VulnCheck breaks down the “who” into four general “attacker-type”
categories:
1. Botnets (e.g. Mirai, Zerobot, etc.)
2. Ransomware (e.g Clop)
3. Threat Actors (e.g. APT32)
4. Unattributed (a source notes exploitation in the wild but doesn’t provide any attribution
information)
The following table contains all 42 vulnerabilities, the reported attacker type, and the publiclyavailable source indicating likely exploitation in the wild.

Botnets
Looking over the table, it’s probably obvious that an overwhelming majority of the
vulnerabilities are related to botnets (64%). However, there are also a number of
ransomware (10%) and threat actor (12%) attributions.
Attacker-Type of Exploited Vulnerabilities Assigned CVE in 2022 Missing From CISA
KEV
The high rate of botnet-exploited vulnerabilities is interesting. Mirai-like botnets are wellknown for flinging exploits all over the internet. That behavior is quickly picked up by
honeypots and intelligence-sharing organizations like Unit 42, 360 Netlab, and Fortiguard
Labs. The high volume of botnet vulnerabilities should be some of the easiest to classify as
exploited in the wild.

4/7

For example, one of the 42 vulnerabilities missing from the CISA KEV Catalog is CVE-201620016 (aka EDB-41471). This vulnerability, which finally received a CVE in 2022, has been
exploited in the wild for years, and still has thousands of potential targets online. It’s had a
Metasploit module since 2017 and is routinely one of the most widely attempted exploit
targets on both ShadowServer and Greynoise. The NVD entry even notes “exploited in the
wild in 2017 through 2022.” It’s obvious this vulnerability belongs in the KEV Catalog.

Vulnerability Classification and Exploits
Last week, we analyzed the type of vulnerabilities that were added to KEV in 2022. We found
about ⅓ of the vulnerabilities are Initial Access, ⅓ are Client Side, and the other ⅓ fell to the
remaining five vulnerability types that VulnCheck assigns. However, the 42 missing
vulnerabilities don’t match that pattern,likely due to the healthy helping of botnet-exploited
vulnerabilities.
Missing Exploited Vulnerabilities Classification
At VulnCheck, we’re very interested in initial access vulnerabilities specifically because they
are so dangerous. Many of these vulnerabilities appear to provide initial access to small
routers and IoT systems. Some will dismiss vulnerabilities in such targets. However, we
know those types of targets are used by advanced threat actors to create massive botnets
like VPNFilter, and(taken down just last year) Cyclops Blink. So, these vulnerabilities should
be taken seriously.
They should also be taken seriously because most of them are well-known. More than 30 of
the vulnerabilities have public exploits, and at least four of those have Metasploit modules.
Additionally, seven have commercially available exploits.

Individual Vulnerabilities
Each of the missing 42 vulnerabilities have interesting context around them too, partly due to
the many different sources and unique points of view shared in their public reporting. Going
through each would be tedious, but the following sections give insight into a few
vulnerabilities that should give readers a general feel for the top vulnerabilities CISA missed.

Chimay Red
CVE-2017-20149, also known as Chimay Red, is a peculiar case. The details of the
vulnerability were originally leaked in 2017 during the Vault 7 leak. The vulnerability affected
the HTTP interface of Mikrotik routers (of which, there are currently more than 600k visible

5/7

on Shodan). Shortly after the disclosure, a high quality exploit was developed by Lorenzo
Santina. Eventually attackers, including the Hajime botnet, exploited this vulnerability in the
wild.
While the vulnerability is getting old, Greynoise continues to see active scanning for the
vulnerability and, using Shodan, we can find approximately 10,000 internet-facing hosts that
are still vulnerable.
However, the most fascinating part of Chimay Redis that it didn’t receive a CVE until 2022
when VulnCheck requested one (MITRE chose to back-date the year). This vulnerability has
been exploited in the wild for approximately five years, and no one saw fit to request a CVE.
Having a CVE is a requirement to be included in the CISA KEV Catalog, and, sadly, appears
to be the only way to remain in the vulnerability historical record.
It’s also worth noting that back when the Shadow Brokers leak occurred, there was an effort
to identify and assign CVE to zero-day vulnerabilities that had been leaked. This was
obviously not the case here. The responsible parties should have done the right thing and
ensured this was assigned a CVE five years ago. Maybe there wouldn’t be any more
vulnerable internet-facing Mikrotik routers if they did.

CVE-2022-28810
CVE-2022-28810 is an authenticated unrestricted operating system command execution
vulnerability affecting ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus. ManageEngine products have
been included in several CISA advisories. For example, in October 2022, a ManageEngine
vulnerability, CVE-2021-40539, was included in a bulletin titled, Top CVEs Actively Exploited
By People’s Republic of China State-Sponsored Cyber Actors.
This vulnerability was first seen in the wild in April 2022 as a zero-day by Rapid7 (full
disclosure: this author was involved in the analysis of the vulnerability). Additionally, ESET
Research noted in their APT Activity Report T2 2022 report that a “defense contractor in the
US” was targeted using this vulnerability. Although ESET couldn’t attribute the attack to a
specific group, it was lumped in with “China-aligned” APT activity.

CVE-2022-2003
Dragos researchers shared a great writeup on finding CVE-2022-2003 in the wild. The
vulnerability was discovered in a PLC “password cracking” program advertised on social
media. Dragos found the cracking software actually worked as advertised, and the software
recovered passwords from AutomationDirect’s DirectLOGIC PLC by exploiting CVE-20222003. Also, hilariously, the cracking software drops malware on the host machine in order to
join it to the Sality botnet.

6/7

ICS-specific vulnerabilities exploited in the wild are few and far between. Dragos uncovered
an attacker specifically targeting PLC and engineering workstations. Given the attacker’s
active engagement on social media, this vulnerability seems like it should have been an easy
add to the KEV Catalog.

CVE-2022-31199
Cisco Talos was able to link CVE-2022-31199, a vulnerability in Netwrix Auditor, to Truebot
activity (and eventually Clop ransomware) in an early December 2022 blog.
An advisory for CVE-2022-31199 was published by Bishop Fox in July 2022. The advisory
has no CVE, but it is linked directly to NVD. To our knowledge, there is no public exploit for
this vulnerability. However, the Bishop Fox advisory, from our experience, provides sufficient
details to recreate the exploit with minimal effort. That’s likely why Talos saw the vulnerability
exploited a “few weeks” after the advisory was published.
Netwrix Auditor isn’t exactly a household name, and there are fewer than a dozen internetfacing targets. The fact that an attacker chose to weaponize this vulnerability and it was
exploited in the wild shows how valuable initial access vulnerabilities are to attackers.

Conclusion
In this blog, we shared 42 vulnerabilities assigned CVEs in 2022, which were publicly
reported to be exploited in the wild. Yet, none of these vulnerabilities are in the CISA KEV
Catalog. The CISA KEV Catalog is undoubtedly helpful and a driving force in our industry.
Still, as long as it’s missing actively exploited vulnerabilities, it cannot be treated as the
authoritative catalog of exploited vulnerabilities. Practitioners should augment vulnerability
management programs by seeking out additional sources or finding a source with a more
complete dataset.
