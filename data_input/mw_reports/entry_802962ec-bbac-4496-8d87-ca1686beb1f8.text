Mission: To serve as a vehicle to receive, develop and refer criminal complaints
regarding the rapidly expanding arena of cybercrime. The Internet Crime Complaint
Center (IC3) gives the victims of cybercrime a convenient and easy-to-use reporting
mechanism that alerts authorities to suspected criminal or civil violations. For
law enforcement and regulatory agencies at the federal, state, local, tribal and
international levels, IC3 provides a central referral mechanism for complaints
involving Internet-related crimes.

2012 Internet Crime Report

Executive Summary
Now in its 13th year of operation, the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3®) has firmly established its role as a valuable
resource for both victims of Internet crime and the law enforcement agencies investigating and prosecuting these crimes. For
the victims, the IC3 provides a convenient and easy-to-use reporting mechanism that alerts authorities to suspected criminal
violations. For law enforcement agencies, the IC3 serves as a conduit to receive Internet-related complaints, to conduct research
related to them and to develop analytical reports based on them for state, local, federal, tribal or international law enforcement
and/or regulatory agencies. These agencies then develop investigations based on the forwarded information, as appropriate.
In 2012, the IC3 received 289,874 consumer complaints with an adjusted dollar loss of $525,441,1101, which is an 8.3-percent
increase in reported losses since 2011. In recognition of this increase, the IC3 expanded its efforts to inform the general public
about online scams by publishing several public service announcements and providing additional tips for Internet consumers.
The IC3’s success has attracted international interest. Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany use the IC3 as a model for
similar cybercrime centers. In furtherance of its continuing support of foreign law enforcement, the IC3 prepared dozens of
country-specific statistical reports and disseminated hundreds of complaint referrals to FBI Legat offices throughout the world.
In 2013, the IC3 will continue to pursue its mission to serve both the online public and law enforcement and regulatory agencies
throughout the entire global community.

Complaint Totals By Year

Method of evaluating loss amounts: The FBI IC3 staff reviewed for validity all complaints that reported a loss of more than $100,000. Analysts also converted losses reported
in foreign currencies to dollars. The final amounts of all reported losses above $100,000 for which the complaint information did not support the loss amount were excluded
from the statistics.

Step-By Step Guide to IC3

Step-By-Step Guide to IC3
History of IC3
The Internet Fraud Complaint Center — a partnership between
the FBI and NW3C (funded by BJA) — was established May
8, 2000, to address the ever-increasing incidence of online
fraud. Just three years later, in response to the exponential
increase in cybercrime of all types, the Center changed its
name to the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3).

The IC3 analysts use automated matching systems to identify
links and commonalities between numerous complaints and
combine the respective complaints into referral groups for
law enforcement. Of the 289,874 complaints received in
2012, 39.64 percent (114,908) reported financial loss.
The IC3 offers remote access
capability, making data available to
law enforcement anywhere. This Webbased access provides users the ability
to aggregate victims and losses to
substantiate criminal activity within
the agency’s area of jurisdiction and
to enhance the development of cases.

Today, the IC3 accepts more

Lifecycle of a Complaint

Lifecycle of a Complaint
All complaints filed with the IC3 follow a specific algorithm.
The first step in this process includes someone filing a
complaint to www.ic3.gov. The complaint information is
either pulled by law enforcement who access the database or
analyzed and grouped with similar cases. While developing

a case, Internet crime analysts compile information from both
open- and closed-source information databases and confer with
state, local, tribal, federal and international law enforcement
personnel. The chart below highlights how the process works.

to wire full or partial payment to a third-party agent via a
wire transfer service, and to fax the payment receipt to the
seller as proof of payment. The criminal pockets the money
but does not deliver a vehicle.

In fraudulent vehicle sales, criminals attempt to sell vehicles
they do not own. An attractive deal is created by advertising
vehicles for sale on various online platforms at prices below
market value. Often the fraudsters claim they must sell
the vehicles quickly because they are relocating for work,
being deployed by the military, or have a tragic family
circumstance and are in need of money. Because of the
exigent circumstances, criminals refuse to meet in person
or allow inspection of the vehicles prior to the sale. To make
the deal appear legitimate, the criminal instructs the victim

In a new twist, the criminals have attempted to pose as
dealers instead of individuals selling a single car. This
allows them to advertise multiple vehicles for sale at one
time on certain platforms, potentially exposing more
victims to the scam.

FBI Impersonation E-mail Scam
The names of various government agencies and highranking government officials have been used in spam
attacks in an attempt to defraud consumers. Government
agencies do not send unsolicited e-mails. Complaints
related to spam e-mails purportedly sent from the FBI
continued to be reported with high frequency to the IC3.
In 2012, the IC3 received about 47 complaints per day of
this type. With an average adjusted loss of approximately
$141 per complaint, victims reported losing more than
$6,604 to this scam every day.

Complaints that directly spoof the name of FBI Director Robert
Mueller continue to make up a large part of the government
impersonation e-mail scams. Those complaints include elements
of Nigerian scam letters (also known as 419 scams) incorporating
get-rich inheritance scenarios, bogus lottery winning
notifications and occasional extortion threats. A vast majority
of the Mueller spoof complaints are simply reports of probable
fraud with no monetary losses incurred by the filer. Nevertheless,
the spoofs continue to pose a viable threat to national security by
undermining public trust that directly impacts law enforcement’s
ability to do its job.

2012 Frequently Reported Internet Crimes

Intimidation/Extortion Scams
Intimidation and extortion scams have evolved over the
years to include some of the following scams.

Telephone Calls
In a twist to the pop-up scareware scheme, victims began
receiving telephone calls from individuals allegedly claiming
to be from legitimate well-known software companies.
The victims of these calls were advised malware had been
detected on their computers and posed an impending threat.
The fraudsters tried to instill a feeling of urgency so victims
would take immediate action and log on to their computers.
Once the victims logged in, the fraudsters directed them
to the utility area of the computers, where they appeared
to demonstrate how the computers were infected. The
fraudsters offered to rid the computers of the malware for
fees ranging from $49 to $450. When the victims agreed
to pay the fees, they were directed to a website where they
entered a code or downloaded a software program that
allowed the fraudsters remote access to their computers.

Payday Loan
The payday loan scam involves victims receiving
harassing telephone calls from individuals claiming they
are delinquent in payments. The callers purport to be
representatives of federal government agencies, various law
firms and other legitimate sounding agencies. The callers
have accurate information associated with the victims,
including Social Security number, date of birth, address,
employer information, bank account numbers, and names
and telephone numbers of relatives and friends. The callers
claim to be collectors for debt-collecting companies.
The fraudsters are relentless in the number of calls made to
the victims’ homes, cell phones and places of employment.
The callers will not provide any details of the alleged payday
loans and become abusive when questioned. The fraudsters
threaten the victims with legal actions, arrests, and in some
cases, physical violence if they refuse to pay. Often, the
callers resort to harassment of the victims’ relatives, friends
and employers.
The fraudsters asked some victims to fax a statement
agreeing to pay a specified amount via a prepaid money
card. It also stated the victim would never dispute the debt.

10 |

Internet Crime Complaint Center

In a slight twist to the scam, the fraudster advised not only
were there warrants for the victims for non-payment, but
there were also warrants for hacking into a specific business
with the intent of obtaining customer information.

Process Server
The fraudsters added a somewhat different approach to
their intimidation tactics when a person purporting to be
a process server for the court appeared at a victim’s place of
employment and at the home of another victim allegedly to
serve papers for a court date. The process server requested
a debit card number for payment to be made in order to
avoid the court process.

The Grandparent Scam
A telephone scam targeting grandparents, and appropriately
named “The Grandparent Scam,” has continued to resurface
over the years. The scam involves fraudsters calling elderly
individuals claiming to be a grandson or granddaughter or
other young relative in a legal or financial crisis. The crises
generally involve claims of being arrested or in a car accident
in another country. The callers create a sense of urgency and
make a desperate plea for money, begging the grandparents
not to tell the parents while often crying to help prevent the
potential victims from discovering the scam.
The callers also impersonated third parties, such as an
attorney or an official, like a U.S. Embassy representative.
Once the potential victims appear to believe the caller,
they are provided instructions to wire money to a specified
individual, often referred to as a bail bondsman, in order for
their grandchild to be released by foreign law enforcement.
Investigations have determined potential victims were
identified via mass-produced lead lists that target specific
demographics.
Complaints reported the callers were from Canada, the
United States, Mexico, Haiti, Guatemala, Peru and the
Dominican Republic. To further obfuscate themselves,
the callers used telephone numbers generated by free
apps, so the bogus telephone number appears on the
recipient’s caller ID.

2012 Internet Crime Report | 13

2012 Frequently Reported Internet Crimes
Real Estate Fraud
Rental Scams
Criminals search websites that list homes for sale and take
information from legitimate ads and post it with their
own e-mail addresses on Craigslist® (without Craigslist’s
consent or knowledge) under the housing rentals category.
To sweeten the pot, the houses are almost always listed with
below-market rental rates. An interested party will contact
the “homeowner” via e-mail, and usually explain that he or
she had to leave the United States quickly because of some
missionary or contract work in Africa. Victims are usually
instructed to send money overseas—enough to cover the first
and last month’s rent—via a wire transfer service (scammers
often believe money cannot be traced once it gets picked
up on the other end). Renters might also be asked to fill
out credit applications asking for personal information like
credit history, Social Security numbers and work history. The
scammers then use this information to commit identity theft.

Timeshare Marketing Scams
Timeshare owners across the country are being scammed
out of millions of dollars by unscrupulous companies that
promise to sell or rent the properties. In the typical scam,
timeshare owners receive unexpected or uninvited telephone
calls or e-mails from criminals posing as sales representatives
for a timeshare resale company. The representative
promises a quick sale, often within 60 to 90 days. The sales
representatives frequently use high-pressure sales tactics
to add a sense of urgency to the deal. Some victims have
reported that sales representatives pressured them by
claiming there was a buyer waiting in the wings, either
on the other line or even present in the office. Timeshare
owners who agree to sell are told that they must pay an upfront fee to cover anything from listing and advertising fees
to closing costs. Many victims have provided credit cards to
pay the fees ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand
dollars. Once the fee is paid, timeshare owners report that

14 |

Internet Crime Complaint Center

the company becomes evasive — calls go unanswered,
numbers are disconnected and websites are inaccessible. In
some cases, timeshare owners who have been defrauded by
a timeshare sales scheme have been subsequently contacted
by an unscrupulous timeshare fraud recovery company
as well. The representative from the recovery company
promises assistance in recovering money lost in the sales
scam. Some recovery companies require an up-front fee for
services rendered while others promise no fees will be paid
unless a refund is obtained for the timeshare owner. The IC3
has identified some instances in which people involved with
the recovery company also have a connection to the resale
company, raising the possibility that timeshare owners are
being scammed twice by the same people.

Loan Modification Scams
A loan modification scam often starts when a bogus loan
company contacts a distraught homeowner and offers a
loan modification plan via phone call, e-mail or mailing. A
homeowner may reach out to these companies after seeing
an ad online or in the newspaper. The loan modification
typically includes a lower interest rate, an extension in the
length of the loan term, a change in the type of loan or any
combination of the three.
As a part of this scam, the company instructs the homeowner
to cease all communication with lenders and stop making
mortgage payments until the loan modification process
is complete. The homeowner is required to send money
to cover “processing fees” and “closing costs” in order
for the new loan to be processed and approved. After the
homeowner sends the money, the loan company ceases
communication, leaving the homeowner behind on actual
mortgage payments and unable to recover funds sent to the
bogus company.

Conclusion

The IC3 understands the importance of informing the public
about the dangers of cybercrime. The IC3’s public service
announcements (PSAs) and scam alerts are posted online
and distributed to law enforcement and various media
outlets. The PSAs keep consumers informed on the latest
cyber trends and keep industry partners up-to-date about
Internet fraud. The scam alerts are based upon information
from law enforcement and complaints submitted to the IC3.
These reports detail recent cybercrime trends and new twists
to previously existing cyber scams.

This report details the IC3’s efforts to prevent and reduce the
prevalence and impact of the crimes highlighted. Throughout
2012, the IC3 continued to support law enforcement officers
in their investigations of Internet-related crimes.

The IC3 maintains the website www.lookstoogoodtobetrue.
com, which is an educational site developed by a joint
federal law enforcement and industry task force. This site
gives consumers an opportunity to submit and review
testimonials. Testimonials include stories in which
consumers were defrauded by a scam, or they did not fall
victim to a scam, and how they avoided becoming a victim.
The PSAs, scam alerts and forms are all found on the IC3’s
website, www.ic3.gov.

In 2012, the IC3 processed 289,874 complaints, representing
more than a half-billion dollars in losses. In accordance with
its mission, the IC3 referred complaints to state, local, federal,
tribal and international law enforcement agencies. The IC3’s
support led to numerous investigations that resulted in
arrests, seizures, convictions and restitution, among other
actions. The IC3 also produced monthly trend analysis
reports, 23 public service announcements, scam alerts, and
other publications to alert law enforcement and the general
public about the pervasiveness of online crime.
The IC3 continually reviews its services and analytical tools to
incorporate the latest advances in technology and ensure law
enforcement needs are met.

Online Crime Prevention Tips
Auction Fraud

•

Beware when money is required up front for
instructions or products.

•

Before you bid, contact the seller with any questions
you have. Review the seller’s feedback.

•

•

Be cautious when dealing with individuals outside of
your own country.

Be suspicious when the job posting claims “no
experience necessary.”

•

•

Ensure you understand refund, return, and warranty
policies.

Do not give your Social Security number when first
interacting with your prospective employer.

•

•

Determine the shipping charges before you buy.

Be wary when replying to unsolicited e-mails for
work-at-home employment.

•

Be wary if the seller only accepts wire transfers or cash.

•

Consider insuring your item.

Credit Card Fraud
•

If purchasing merchandise, ensure it is from a
reputable source. Do research to ensure legitimacy
of the individual or company.

Identity Theft
•

Ensure websites are secure before submitting a
credit card number.

•

Never throw away credit card or bank statements in
usable form.

•

Be aware of missed bills, which could indicate the
account has been taken over.

•

Beware of providing credit card information through
unsolicited e-mails.

•

Be cautious of scams requiring personal
information.

•

Promptly reconcile credit card statements to avoid
unauthorized charges.

•

Never give a credit card number over the phone
unless you make the call.

•

Monitor credit statements monthly for any
fraudulent activity. Review a copy of your credit
report at least once a year.

•

Report unauthorized transactions to bank or credit
card companies as soon as possible.

Debt Elimination
•

Know who you are doing business with – do your
research. Contact the state Attorney General’s Office
or the State Corporation Commission to see if there
are any registered complaints.

•

Be cautious when dealing with individuals outside
of your own country.

•

Ensure that you understand all terms and
conditions of any agreement.

•

Be wary of businesses that operate from P.O. boxes
or mail drops.

Employment/Business Opportunities
•

Be wary of inflated claims of product effectiveness.

•

Be cautious of exaggerated claims of possible
earnings or profits.

Investment Fraud, Ponzi and Pyramid Schemes
•

If the opportunity appears too good to be true, it
probably is.

•

Beware of promises to make fast profits.

•

Be wary of investments that offer high returns at
little or no risk.

•

Be cautious when you are required to bring in
subsequent investors.

•

Do not invest in anything unless you understand
the deal.
2012 Internet Crime Report | 21

Appendix II

•

Independently verify the terms of any investment
that you intend to make. Beware of references given
by the promoter.

•

Do not assume a company is legitimate based on
the appearance of the website.

•

Be cautious when responding to investment offers
received through unsolicited e-mail.

Lotteries
•

Be wary if you do not remember entering a lottery
or contest.

•

Be cautious if you receive a telephone call stating
you are the winner of a lottery.

•

Beware of lotteries that charge a fee before
delivering your prize.

•

Be wary of demands to send additional money to be
eligible for future winnings.

•

Know that it is a violation of federal law to play a
foreign lottery via mail or phone.

•

Be wary if the ship-to address is yours but the name
on the package is not.

•

Do not accept packages you did not order.

•

If you receive packages you did not order, either
refuse delivery or contact the company that sent
the package.

Romance Scams
•

Be cautious of individuals who claim it was destiny
or fate and you are meant to be together, or claim
God brought you to him/her. They often claim to
love you within 24-48 hours.

•

These individuals want your address to send you
flowers, candy and teddy bears, often purchased with
stolen credit cards.

•

They ask for your phone number, but when they call,
you can barely understand them.

•

Be wary if an individual tells you they are so in love
with you that they cannot live without you but they
need you to send them some money so they can come
to see you. To them, love equals financial assistance.
If you do not send them money or help them out
with what they ask, you do not love them.

•

They typically claim to be from the United States (or
your local region) but they are overseas, or going
overseas, mainly to Nigeria, sometimes the United
Kingdom, for business or family matters.

Phishing/Spoofing
•

Be suspicious of any unsolicited e-mail requesting
personal information.

•

Avoid filling out forms in e-mail messages that ask for
personal information. This could be a phishing scam.

•

Always compare the link in the e-mail to the link
that you are actually directed to visit.

•

Log on to the entity’s official website instead of
“linking” to it from an unsolicited e-mail.

•

Contact the actual business that supposedly sent the
e-mail to verify if the e-mail is genuine.

Reshipping
•

Be cautious if you are asked to ship packages to an
“overseas home office.”

•

Be suspicious if an individual states that his country
will not allow direct business shipments from the
United States.

22 |

Internet Crime Complaint Center

Spam
•

Do not open spam. Delete it.

•

Never respond to spam because this will confirm to
the sender that it is a valid e-mail address.

•

Have a primary and secondary e-mail address
— one for people you know and one for all other
purposes.

•

Avoid giving out your e-mail address unless you
know how it will be used.

•

Never purchase anything advertised through
unsolicited e-mail.
