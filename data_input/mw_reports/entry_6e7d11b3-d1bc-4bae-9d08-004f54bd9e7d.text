The Iranian threat group blurs the line between financially motivated attacks and espionage.
Thursday, May 12, 2022 By: Counter Threat Unit Research Team
Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers are investigating attacks by the
Iranian COBALT MIRAGE threat group, which has been operating since at least June 2020.
COBALT MIRAGE is linked to the Iranian COBALT ILLUSION threat group, which
1/12

predominantly uses persistent phishing campaigns to obtain initial access. It is possible that
the two groups share tradecraft and access. Elements of COBALT MIRAGE activity have
been reported as PHOSPHOROUS and TunnelVision.
Based on intelligence gained from Secureworks incident response engagements and public
reporting, CTU™ researchers identified two distinct clusters of COBALT MIRAGE intrusions
(labeled as Cluster A and Cluster B in Figure 1). In Cluster A, the threat actors use BitLocker
and DiskCryptor to conduct opportunistic ransomware attacks for financial gain. Cluster B
focuses on targeted intrusions to gain access and collect intelligence, but some of the activity
has experimented with ransomware.

COBALT MIRAGE has demonstrated a preference for attacking organizations in Israel, the
U.S., Europe, and Australia. The threat actors obtain initial access via scan-and-exploit
activity. In 2021, COBALT MIRAGE scanned ports 4443, 8443, and 10443 for devices
vulnerable to Fortinet FortiOS vulnerabilities CVE-2018-13379, CVE-2020-12812, and CVE2019-5591. From late September 2021, the group used a broad scan-and-exploit campaign
targeting Microsoft Exchange servers. The threat actors exploited the ProxyShell
vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523, and CVE-2021-31207) to deploy Fast
Reverse Proxy client (FRPC) and enable remote access to vulnerable systems.
In November 2021, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
released an advisory (AA21-321A) pertaining to activity that CTU researchers attribute to
COBALT MIRAGE. The advisory does not name a specific group, instead referring to an
"Iranian government-sponsored APT group."
In January 2022, COBALT MIRAGE used access obtained through ProxyShell exploitation,
possibly conducted in late 2021, to enter the network of a U.S. philanthropic organization. On
January 6, the threat actors created and accessed a web shell named
aspx_okqmeibjplh.aspx. The format of this filename matches an established pattern
associated with COBALT MIRAGE ransomware operations: aspx_[a-z]{13}\.aspx. Attackerinitiated HTTP requests to the web shell used a User-Agent named python-requests/2.23.0,
2/12

indicating the use of scripts that leverage the Python Requests library. The Python reference
is likely due to the threat actors using a Python-based proof-of-concept ProxyShell exploit in
their initial attack and potentially additional scripted commands during the intrusion.
After the threat actors obtained access via the web shell, three files were dropped on the
web server: Wininet.xml, Wininet.bat, and dllhost.exe. CTU analysis of Wininet.xml revealed
it being used to create a scheduled task that launches C:\Windows\Wininet.bat. When
Wininet.bat is launched, it executes C: \Windows\dllhost.exe (see Figure 2).

Figure 2. Process tree showing the execution of dllhost.exe. (Source: Secureworks)
Dllhost.exe is a custom Go binary that references GitHub repositories associated with Fast
Reverse Proxy (FRP), indicating the binary is based at least in part on this tool. FRP is
routinely deployed by COBALT MIRAGE. However, dllhost.exe also includes code from other
projects and behaves differently from a typical FRPC binary.
When the threat actors execute dllhost.exe on a compromised Exchange server, the binary
executes three commands as child processes (see Figure 3). These processes collect basic
information about the host and establish a tunnel to the defined command and control (C2)
servers. There are two versions of the same PowerShell command. One version uses an
older PowerShell binary filename. The other uses the pwsh.exe filename implemented in
PowerShell Core 6.0, which was released in January 2018.

Figure 3. Commands executed by dllhost.exe. (Source: Secureworks)
Dllhost.exe uses the 'tcp443 . msupdate . us' and 'kcp53 . msupdate . us' subdomains for
command and control. The inclusion of a protocol (tcp, kcp) and port number (443, 53) is a
pattern across COBALT MIRAGE subdomain names. This binary has also been distributed
from http: //148 . 251 . 71 . 182/update_win. In December 2021, CTU researchers observed
COBALT MIRAGE experimenting with Log4j exploits hosted on 148 . 251 . 71 . 182.
3/12

The threat actors conducted a Local Security Authority Server Service (LSASS) dump soon
after dllhost.exe executed its commands. LSASS is a Windows process that stores local
usernames and passwords for authenticated users. Threat actors can use the data to derive
valid credentials by brute-force cracking New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM) hashes or
extracting passwords stored in plain text.
CTU researchers' observations and analysis of these attacks align with third-party reporting
of other activity that CTU researchers attribute to COBALT MIRAGE. Those reports describe
ProxyShell being used to deploy web shells and files with the same filenames around the
same time period as these attacks.
Three days after deploying dllhost.exe, the threat actors used Remote Desktop Protocol
(RDP) and a built-in user account (DefaultAccount) to log onto the compromised Exchange
server (see Figure 4). This was the first login to the server from DefaultAccount and could
indicate the beginning of threat actor hands-on-keyboard activity. The threat actors then
attempted to extract locally cached passwords by again dumping the LSASS process. They
enumerated the environment via the SoftPerfect Network Scanner tool using the filename
netscanold.exe.

The threat actors moved laterally and encrypted three user workstations with BitLocker,
rendering them inaccessible to the compromised organization's staff. Due to an absence of
logging and forensic artifacts, the methods used to trigger BitLocker in this environment are
unclear. However, other COBALT MIRAGE ransomware attacks used a script (see Figure 5)
to automate the attack.

This script performs the following actions:
Sets a 'mail=' variable to a defined contact email address
Enables Terminal Services (renamed Remote Desktop Services after Windows Server
2008)
Creates a firewall rule to enable RDP access to the host
Starts Terminal Services
Initiates BitLocker disk encryption
Defines a ransom message
Adds multiple registry keys related to BitLocker and creates a message that displays
the ransom message and contact email address
Creates a 'MSSQL' user account on the compromised system with password
_AS_@1394 and adds it to the administrators and Remote Desktop Users groups

5/12

The threat actors completed the attack with an unusual tactic of sending a ransom note to a
local printer. The note includes a contact email address and Telegram account to discuss
decryption and recovery (see Figure 6). This approach suggests a small operation that relies
on manual processes to map victims to the encryption keys used to lock their data. As of this
publication, CTU researchers are not aware of a COBALT MIRAGE leak site. Although some
Iranian-linked attacks against Middle Eastern organizations in 2020 and 2021 appeared to
use ransomware to cause fear and disruption, the victimology of the COBALT MIRAGE
attacks suggests that these threat actors are focused on financial gain.

In March 2022, CTU researchers attributed an intrusion in a U.S. local government network
to COBALT MIRAGE based on the use of a DefaultUser user account, deployment of FRPC
to the victim's network, and use of infrastructure that matches a pattern associated with
COBALT MIRAGE. However, ransomware was not used in the attack. This activity is part of
Cluster B.
Analysis of COBALT MIRAGE attacks is challenging because unrelated threat actors have
often also compromised the environment using the same vulnerabilities (e.g., ProxyShell,
Log4Shell). Many of these threat actors use the same publicly available proof-of-concept
code and may access the same environment multiple times, dropping redundant web shells.
Cryptominer infections are often observed alongside COBALT MIRAGE activity, but they may
have been deployed by another group.
The initial access vector in the March 2022 engagement is unclear, but the threat actors
likely exploited Log4j vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-44228, CVE-2021-45046) on the victim's
VMware Horizon infrastructure. In early 2022, CTU researchers observed multiple threat
actors exploiting Log4j vulnerabilities on VMware Horizon to deploy cryptominers. The initial
exploitation by COBALT MIRAGE may have occurred as early as late January 2022. After
obtaining access, COBALT MIRAGE used the DefaultAccount user to move laterally within
the environment via RDP.

Most of the intrusion activity spanned a four-day period in mid-March. At one point, the threat
actors used a system in the victim's environment to conduct Google searches for "upload file
for free" and then accessed filemail . com, ufile . io, mega . nz, and easyupload . io. Logs
indicate that one or more of these sites may have been used to exfiltrate data from the
environment. The threat actors also downloaded several files (e.g., 23.zip, pxy.zip, pxy.rar)
onto compromised systems using the easyupload . io and ufile . io file-sharing services.
The 23.zip file was not available for analysis, but pxy.zip includes a set of files to establish a
persistent remote tunnel to an attacker-controlled server via FRPC (see Figure 7). The hash
of the FRPC binary deployed by the threat actors is identical to the binary hash listed in the
November 2021 CISA advisory. Similar to other COBALT MIRAGE domains used in Cluster
B, the C2 domain in this incident (my-logford . ml) is registered with the Freenom registrar.
Domains in Cluster A are typically registered with Porkbun.

Figure 7. Contents and execution flow of files in pxy.zip. (Source: Secureworks)
Pxy.rar contains the same files as pxy.zip and also includes wmiexec.exe, which is a
compiled version of the Python-based wmiexec.py Impacket tool. The threat actors obtained
access to multiple accounts within the victim's environment and downloaded pxy.zip to
several hosts to provide redundant access. The Ngrok tunneling tool was also deployed
within the environment while the COBALT MIRAGE actors were present, but it is unclear if
they deployed the tool or if it was deployed by another threat group. Iranian threat groups
such as COBALT FOXGLOVE have used this tool in the past, but there is no indication that
COBALT FOXGLOVE was involved in this intrusion.
The threat actors downloaded a network scanner to enumerate the environment, performing
a Google search for "softperfect network scanner portable" and downloading
netscan_portable_v621.zip from mega . nz. The threat actors conducted multiple scans and
based the results filename on the IP address of the scanned system. The threat actors
uploaded the network scans and other tool output to ufile . io.

7/12

After the March 2022 intrusion was detected and disrupted, no additional malicious activity
was observed. CTU researchers have not directly observed ransomware attacks linked to
Cluster B, but there is evidence that those threat actors may be experimenting with
ransomware. A file (rsf.exe) uploaded to the VirusTotal analysis service from Iran on
December 29, 2021 appears to be an unfinished attempt at ransomware. It contains a PDB
string with an unusual username (C:\Users\pugna\) that was also identified in the
PowerLessCLR remote access trojan (RAT). This RAT has been hosted on the 162 . 55 . 137
. 20 IP address used by COBALT MIRAGE. CTU researchers have also observed COBALT
MIRAGE infrastructure hosting files related to the HiddenTear open-source ransomware
family but have not observed the ransomware being deployed to targets.
The January and March incidents typify the different styles of attacks conducted by COBALT
MIRAGE. While the threat actors appear to have had a reasonable level of success gaining
initial access to a wide range of targets, their ability to capitalize on that access for financial
gain or intelligence collection appears limited. At a minimum, COBALT MIRAGE's ability to
use publicly available encryption tools for ransomware operations and mass scan-and-exploit
activity to compromise organizations creates an ongoing threat. CTU researchers
recommend that organizations prioritize patching high-severity and highly publicized
vulnerabilities on internet-facing systems, implementing multi-factor authentication, and
monitoring for the tools and file-sharing services used by COBALT MIRAGE.
To mitigate exposure to this malware, CTU researchers recommend that organizations use
available controls to review and restrict access using the indicators listed in Table 1. Note
that IP addresses can be reallocated. The domains and IP addresses may contain malicious
content, so consider the risks before opening them in a browser.
