The resurgence of the Ursnif banking trojan

Earlier this month, Darktrace’s Cyber AI detected the Ursnif banking trojan, described as
May’s most wanted malware, making a resurgence across its customers’ networks. This blog
follows the malicious activity in one financial services company in the US, detailing how and
why Darktrace Antigena stepped in and autonomously stopped the attack in real time.
Banking trojans continue to present a credible and persistent threat to organizations of all
sizes across the globe. This attack was delivered via phishing email, which initiated a
download of an executable file masquerading as a .cab extension.
This specific banking trojan is particularly sophisticated, with multiple new command and
control (C2) domains registered – identifiable because several distinct Domain Generation
Algorithms (DGA) were observed across different networks – the majority of which were only
registered the day prior to the campaign.

Phishing email catches organizations unaware

The malware itself was delivered via phishing email. The attack was not recognized by
antivirus solutions at the time of delivery, slipping through the organization’s perimeter
solutions and landing in employees’ inboxes. Unknowingly, an employee opened a disguised
attachment containing macros, downloading an executable file masquerading as a .cab
extension.
Interestingly, the malware also used new User Agents imitating Zoom and Webex, a clear
attempt to blend in with assumed network traffic. After the malware was downloaded, several
devices were observed making connections using these Zoom or Webex User Agents to
non-Zoom and non-Webex domains, another attempt to blend in.

time of the executable file download
After the downloads, Darktrace’s AI observed beaconing to rare DGA domains. The majority
of these domains were Russian and registered within the previous 24 hours.

Figure 5: The External Sites Summary of one of the C2 domains observed,
tobmojiol2adf[.]com, which was identified as 100% rare for the network at the time of the
model breach.
This attack managed to evade the rest of the organization’s security stack since the domains
observed were recently registered and the majority of the file hashes and IoCs had not yet
been flagged by OSINT tools, thus bypassing all signature-based detections. The initial file
downloads also purported to be .cab files, but Darktrace’s AI identified that these were in fact
executable files.
Multiple Darktrace detections, including the ‘Masqueraded File Transfer’ model and the
‘Initial Breach Chain Compromise’ model, alerted the security team to this activity. At the
same time, the models triggered Darktrace’s Cyber AI Analyst to launch an automated
investigation into the security incident, which surfaced additional vital information and
dramatically reduced time to triage.

The case for Autonomous Response
The Ursnif banking trojan presents a particularly lethal threat: silent, stealthy, and capable of
stealing vital financial information, email credentials, and other sensitive data at machine
speeds. The rise of advanced malware like this demonstrates the need for security
technology that can stay ahead of attackers. For this organization, the malware download
and subsequent command and control activity could have represented the start of a costly
attack.
Luckily the organization had Antigena Network installed in active mode. The C2
communications from infected devices were blocked seconds after the initial connection,
preventing further C2 activity and the download of any additional malware. Using information
surfaced by the Cyber AI Analyst, the security team could catch up and the threat was
quickly contained.
This attack highlights the continuously evolving approaches used by malicious actors to
evade detection. In the same week as the events explained above, Darktrace identified the
Urnsnif malware in numerous other customers in the US and Italy, across multiple industries.
Attackers are targeting businesses indiscriminately and are not slowing down.
Thanks to Darktrace analysts Grace Carballo and Hiromi Watanabe for their insights on the
above threat find.
