State of Ransomware
Industry Update ANZ 2020

STATE OF RANSOMEWARE, ANZ 2020

The increased reporting of cyber incidents among large companies in ANZ in the
first half of 2020 has been clearly evident. A handful of ransomware families are
dominating these attacks. In this paper, we investigate some of the tactics used
by these ransomware families, their high profile victims, and the strategies used
to defend against these threats.
It is not uncommon for many organisations to fail to report breaches, or worse,
to be completely unaware that they have even taken place. Ransomware is
being used for much more than just blackmail. It can be used as a diversion; first
harvesting credentials for later use, and then encrypting the drive to keep IT staff
occupied while the attacker covers their tracks.

It is not uncommon for
many organisations to
fail to report breaches, or
worse, to be completely
unaware that they have
even taken place.

More recently, attackers have accomplished even more nefarious objectives, like
sending critical data to the dark web, or auctioning it to the highest bidder.

Everything as a service
Ransomware can be easily obtained and used by criminals that have little to no hacking skills, in what is known as
Ransomware as a Service (RaaS). By establishing a network of affiliate partners, malware authors are able to spread
their ransomware widely and scale earnings dramatically in the process.
Many threat actors have evolved from mass-volume consumer attacks, opting instead for more carefully planned
and targeted attacks aimed at maximising disruption. By using a RaaS model, the authors of malware are
significantly lowering the bar for launching such attacks, making this particular form of cybercrime accessible and
profitable for a larger pool of potential criminals.

Many of our customers sought out BlackBerry because
it is highly effective in preventing ransomware attacks.
In each case, BlackBerry was able to analyse, predict
and prevent the threat, with no updates required, on
average over 1000 days before the malware was first
discovered in the wild.

ANZ in the headlines

Toll Group, the Melbourne based global logistics company, has been hit
twice by ransomware attacks in 2020 - in January by MailTo and in June
by Nefilim. Also in June, government agency ServiceNSW, steel maker
BlueScope, and a financial services company, MyBudget, all made the
headlines due to high-profile cyber-attacks.

Anatomy of an attack – Emotet, Trickbot and Ryuk

There are a number of vectors ransomware can take to access a computer.
One of the most common delivery systems is phishing - attachments
that come to the victim in an email, appearing as a file from a trusted
source. Often clever social engineering is used to make the e-mail appear
legitimate. Emotet, as an example, can scrape mail files and craft mail to
colleagues using previous content. Emotet malware is typically used as a
loader for TrickBot campaigns. Once loaded, TrickBot uses several modules
to carry out various activities on the victim’s system. It allows for lateral
movement and enables utilities to be loaded manually by the operators.
Once post-exploitation tools are loaded, the domain controller (DC) is
attacked. When privileged access to the DC is acquired, Ransomware such
as Ryuk can be deployed across the network at the botnet operator’s will.

Another vulnerability that has been exposed is Remote Desktop Protocol
(RDP). Used to enable remote access, RDP has a history of insecurity,
leading to attacks either by brute force or exploitation. Perhaps the most
infamous instance of ransomware, WannaCry, also took advantage of
exploitable networking protocols.

Installation

Unfortunately, traditional defensive measures such as anti-virus agents are
unlikely to stop ransomware, since the attacker can easily disable them.
