How Flubot targets Android phone users and their money
nortonlifelock.com/blogs/research-group/flubot-targets-android-phone-users

Malware steals login credentials for banking and cryptocurrency
apps — and it could spread around the world
Flubot, also called Cabassous, is an Android banking malware (also a banking
trojan) that is pushed by cybercriminals in large-scale campaigns, targeting consumers
across Europe this spring.
Access to the botnet is being sold in underground forums by the operators to criminal
groups as a so-called malware-as-a-service (MAAS). The actors behind
the Flubot botnet sending Smishing (SMS phishing) messages with fake notices of
upcoming package deliveries and urge the victim to follow a link to track the shipment.
The landing page then presents a download button supposedly required to track the
package. After a victim falls for this social engineering trick, Flubot is downloaded to the
mobile device and requests various permissions, including access to the contact list, sending
SMS messages, and overlaying other applications.
The contact list is subsequently sent to a command-and-control (C&C or C2) server and
used to seed new waves of smishing messages that are sent through infected
phones (devices).

The Flubot malware does not exploit any vulnerabilities in the Android OS or
targeted devices but prompts the user to manually grant two powerful system
permissions. These permissions allow the attackers to
steal credentials from banking and cryptocurrency apps on infected devices, using overlays
and then exfiltrate one-time-password (OTP) and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes.

Campaigns and versions
From late 2020 and into early 2021, an initial Flubot campaign hit Spain
and reportedly infected more than 60,000 Android devices. Spanish police
investigated and eventually arrested four men suspected of being involved in the campaign.
As mentioned earlier, the Flubot operators had been renting out the botnet, so the suspects
arrested in Spain are likely just “customers” of the actual Flubot operators, trying to
monetize access to victims’ mobile phones. This is further evidenced by the fact that new
campaigns against additional countries started to emerge soon after.
The Flubot developers have been busy adding support for new target countries to the
malware as shown for version 3.6 to 4.1 in the visualization below.

The screenshot below shows an example of a SMS message targeting German users to lure
them into following a link to track a fictitious package shipment:

In some cases, the messages include the name of the recipient-— likely crafted using stolen
contact-list data from previous victims.
The respective links lead to country-specific landing pages, as can be seen in
the comparison of DHL-themed download sites below:

There are different variants of the Flubot app that disguise themselves by using the brand
names of package delivery services like DHL, FedEx, UPS, or the Spanish postal service
Correos.

Statistics

8/25

Norton Labs researchers analyzed the telemetry of our mobile protection technologies to
measure the prevalence of Flubot affecting our customers. The chart below shows the total
number of attempted installations of Flubot in blue. The orange line represents Flubot lure
SMS messages as a percentage of total blocked SMS messages from unknown senders for
the respective day.

The second wave of attempted Flubot installations in our statistics from around April 4 to
April 11 coincides with the campaign in Germany. The third wave of attempted installations at
the end of April corresponds with the start of the Flubot campaign targeting mobile phone
numbers in the UK. The related smishing attacks (orange line) peaking a few days earlier.
Shown below are metrics from sinkholing efforts (as provided by Shadowserver on May
11 (and previously on April 27) for seeds 1136, 1642, 1813, 1905, 1949, and 2931. These
efforts show a decline in infections (Refer to the table of countries and seed values below).
As with many sophisticated malware families, it’s reasonable to expect an ebb and flow in
the infection (and detection) rates as sinkholing and mitigation efforts are leapfrogged by the
operator’s improvements.

Analysis
The Flubot malware continues to evolve through active development since
its introduction to the cybercrime underground. Especially since March of 2021, several
versions were released ranging from 3.5 to 4.1. Even for samples
with the same version number, our analyses revealed differences and the addition of new
features. The research described in this section is the result of analyzing variants
of Flubot version 4.0 that only differed in the list of targeted countries but not in functionality.

Permissions
Flubot requests an extensive list of Android permissions through the system dialog upon
installation:

Once the app is executed, it prompts the user to grant two additional permissions by
following instructions to manually allow “Accessibility Service” and “Notification Access”
through the phone’s system settings.
10/25

Below screenshots show the app prompting the user to enable the “Accessibility
Service” and its respective setting screen. The Android “Accessibility Service” is supposed to
allow apps to assist users with disabilities. This app setting grants powerful
permissions to control what is shown on the phone display and to intercept user
input. Several Android malware families have integrated prompts to socially engineer the
user into willfully enabling the accessibility setting to then use it for keylogging of credentials
and overlay app screens (see below).

In the next step, the user is prompted to also enable “Notification Access” for the app in the
corresponding system dialog.

Flubot will use the “Accessibility Service” permission to register as the default
messaging app on the phone. This allows the malware to quietly send and intercept SMS
messages and thus capture OTPs used in online banking.

Overlays
The main functionality of the Flubot mobile banking trojan is to steal login credentials for
banking and cryptocurrency apps running on the phone. The malware achieves this using
the previously mentioned permissions and abusing existing Android APIs.
After installation, it will send a list of installed applications that the C2 server matches to a list
of package names targeted by the cybercriminals. Flubot will then download specifically
crafted HTML pages that will be displayed as an “overlay” when the respective app is

started. When the user then enters their credentials, they interact with Flubot instead of the
banking app and their credentials are harvested.
The following screenshot shows an overlay captured on an infected analysis device that
intercepts the login for Spanish Liberbank:

Domain generation algorithm
Instead of using a static list of C2 servers, the developers added a domain generation
algorithm (DGA) to Flubot. Early versions Flubot generated a list of 2,000 domains each
month, while the most recent version 4.0 can generate up to 5,000 domains. When
generating the domains, the algorithm alternates between appending the top-level
domains .ru (Russia), .su (Senegal), and .cn (China). This is notable, because it is more
difficult for network operators to sinkhole domains in these top-level domains.

The algorithm calculates the initialization value for the random number generator in the
function above using two parameters: the year/month and a static seed value.

18/25

Until Flubot version 3.7 the seed value remained static, while later versions include different
seed values depending on the country code of the infected Android phone as shown in the
screenshot below:

The current list of countries and seed values for Flubot in the analyzed variants are as
follows:

After generating the DGA domains, the malware will iterate through the list and try to
resolve each entry to an IP. While early versions of Flubot used the DNS service configured
in the phone, recent versions have switched to utilize encrypted DNS-over-HTTPS services
from Cloudflare and Google.

The communication from the C2 to the Flubot malware is encrypted using an XOR operation
with a static key. Communication in the opposite direction, from the malware to the
C2, uses RSA Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to encrypt the data. This also doubles as
a protection mechanism to prevent researchers or competitors from taking
over the botnet via C2. While the C2 is protected through this PKI
scheme, sinkholing predicted DGA domains is still possible.

20/25

The malware also generates a random “Bot ID” and retrieves device information such as
Device ID and manufacturer details which is then submitted to the botnet during
communication with the C2 server. The “Bot ID” and the first working DGA domain will then
be stored in an XML configuration file:

Botnet commands
When communicating with the C2 server, the botnet can respond with the following list of
commands:

Besides the overlays targeting specific applications, the malware also has a
generic mechanism to steal credit card information through social engineering. This is
triggered by a “CARD_BLOCK” command from the C2 server and displays a “Google Play
Verification Window” as shown below:

Evasion
The Flubot developers are using a custom packer and evasion mechanisms to complicate
detection and analysis of the malware. The main application is packed and stored under the
filename “assets/classes-v1.bin.” Once the app is executed, it unpacks the malware
into “app_apkprotector_dex/classes-v1.dex” of the application’s data directory. In addition,
text strings in the unpacked file are obfuscated likely using the opensource string obfuscator
framework Paranoid1.
The screenshots below show a list of strings in Flubot before and after manual deobfuscation:

Version 4.1
Shortly before the publication of this report, a version 4.1 of Flubot was discovered. However,
the analysis described above still apply to the new version as well.

Summary & Outlook
Mobile banking trojans like Flubot are becoming more popular among cybercriminals as
more consumers than ever before rely on mobile devices for internet banking, access to
financial services, and e-commerce. The Flubot malware is in active development and is
likely to continue to spread throughout the world as support for new regions and functionality
is implemented in future versions.
Flutbot can circumvent security controls by tricking the end-user into giving powerful
system permissions. Better user awareness training is key to combatting this type of attack:
23/25

Only install applications from trusted sources like the Google Play store.
Only grant permissions to trusted applications and understand what capabilities that
permission is granting before accepting them.
