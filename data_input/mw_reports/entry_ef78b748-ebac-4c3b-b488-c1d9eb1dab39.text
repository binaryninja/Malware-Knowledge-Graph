Executive Summary Ransomware attacks have been in the news
with increased frequency over the past few years. This type of
malware can be extremely disruptive and even cause operational
impacts in critical systems that may be infected. LockerGoga is yet
another example of this sort of malware. It is a ransomware variant
that, while lacking in sophistication, can still cause extensive
damage when leveraged against organizations or individuals. Cisco
Talos has also seen wiper malware impersonate ransomware, such
as the NotPetya attack.

Earlier versions of LockerGoga leverage an encryption process to remove the victim's ability
to access files and other data that may be stored on infected systems. A ransom note is
then presented to the victim that demands the victim pay the attacker in Bitcoin in exchange
for keys that may be used to decrypt the data that LockerGoga has impacted. Some of the
later versions of LockerGoga, while still employing the same encryption, have also been
observed forcibly logging the victim off of the infected systems and removing their ability to
log back in to the system following the encryption process. The consequence is that in
many cases, the victim may not even be able to view the ransom note, let alone attempt to
comply with any ransom demands. These later versions of LockerGoga could then be
described as destructive.
While the initial infection vector associated with LockerGoga is currently unknown, attackers
can use a wide variety of techniques to gain network access, including exploiting unpatched
vulnerabilities and phishing user credentials. Expanding initial access into widespread
control of the network is facilitated by similar techniques with stolen user credentials being
an especially lucrative vector to facilitate lateral movement. For example, the actors behind
the SamSam attacks leveraged vulnerable servers exposed to the internet as their means
of obtaining initial access to environments they were targeting.

LockerGoga Details Several of the LockerGoga samples observed in
the wild appear to have been signed using a certificate that was
issued to ALISA LTD by Sectigo:

This was likely an attempt by the malware author to minimize anti-malware detection, as
executables that are signed using valid certificates may not be analyzed as rigorously as
executables with no signature verification. The certificate has since been revoked by the
issuer.
During the infection process, the LockerGoga executable is copied to the %TEMP%
directory on the victim system and executed.
Talos has also observed versions of the LockerGoga ransomware that attempt to clear the
Windows Event Logs using the following command syntax:
The ransomware then creates the ransom note and begins the encryption process.
LockerGoga supports many of the common types of files that organizations typically use to
store important data. As files are encrypted, the originals are deleted and replaced with the
encrypted data, which is stored as files with the "*.LOCKED" file extension. Unlike many
ransomware variants commonly observed, LockerGoga also encrypts the contents of the
victim's Recycle Bin directory.
One other interesting aspect of the LockerGoga variant is that the files appear to be
encrypted individually. When interacting with the sample, Talos observed commands being
executed to encrypt each individual file, an example of which you can find below. This isn't
commonly done since it's inefficient and creates overhead.

LockerGoga Ransom Note Following a successful infection, the
LockerGoga ransomware writes a ransom note to the victim's
desktop as a text file called "README_LOCKED.txt." Note that, in
our research, we did find another campaign in January that was
using a ransom note filename of "README-NOW.txt." Opening the
ransom note with Notepad reveals the following:
Interestingly, unlike many of the more sophisticated ransomware variants seen in recent
years, the ransom note does not include instructions for using a payment portal to process
the ransom payment. It also does not include a Bitcoin or Monero wallet address and simply
includes instructions for contacting the malware distributor via two email addresses that are
included in the note. Talos has observed different emails listed across various samples that
were analyzed.
There also does not appear to be a dedicated command and control (C2) structure set up to
facilitate remote connectivity with the attackers. The attackers are also offering to decrypt a
small number of encrypted files for free as a way to further convince victims of the

legitimacy of the operation and maximize the likelihood that the victim will pay the ransom
demand. Additionally, Talos has observed no evidence to suggest that LockerGoga has the
ability to self propagate across hosts on a network where an infection has taken place.

Conclusion Data is a valuable resource on all of our systems,
whether that data is user photos or corporate documents.
Therefore, ransomware continues to be a significant threat because
it enables an attacker to steal that valuable data and hold it for
ransom. Talos has seen financially motivated cybercriminals using
ransomware in an attempt to generate a profit while other
adversaries have used ransomware as a cover (such as the Not
Petya attack) to disrupt the operation of the network, and hide their
tracks by making forensic analysis more difficult.
Between using active exploitation, sending a threat via email or over the web, or even using
stolen or bought credentials the possibilities are virtually endless. This is where some of the
basic tenets of security come into play. Organizations increasingly need to have near realtime visibility into their endpoints in addition to the protective capabilities that products like
AMP provide. Additionally, having multi-factor authentication (MFA) like Duo, enabled on
systems can help prevent initial infection or slow its spread by limiting lateral access.
Following established best practices with regard to network architecture and proper network
segmentation can also help minimize operational disruption from threats such as
ransomware, wiper malware, etc. Talos will continue to monitor this threat to ensure that
customers remain protected from any evolutions that will inevitably occur.
Note: This blog post discusses active research by Talos. This information should be
considered preliminary and will be updated as research continues.
