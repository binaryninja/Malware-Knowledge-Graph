Updated 23 Nov 1355 MST: Added some additional observations related to logon spoofing infrastructure.
Domain “hunting” is a process of identifying new (or at least, newly identified) network infrastructure associated with threat
actors of interest. Such a process does not start in a void, but rather requires understanding tendencies and patterns
associated with adversary infrastructure creation and management. This is especially effective when viewing individual
network observables – or indicators – as natural composite objects, items that accrue multiple sub-observations relating to
the given object’s creation, use, and potentially even intention.
One historical example of such activity is ThreatConnect’s analysis of (then) long-running infrastructure tendencies linked to
APT28, also known as FancyBear, but associated with Russian Military Intelligence (GRU) 85th Main Special Service Center
(GTsSS). ThreatConnect’s reporting publicized patterns used by intelligence professionals for several years prior, using a
combination of x509 certificate information, domain registration tendencies, and domain hosting patterns to identify new
APT28 infrastructure with high confidence as it was created. Unfortunately, the adversary largely migrated away from these
patterns shortly after the blog’s publication, but the overall idea remains a solid mechanism to systematize external threat
hunting as well as implementing an intelligence-driven pivoting process.
There are multiple ways to approach domain hunting and tracking. One reasonable mechanism is to utilize internal visibility of
newly-observed network objects or external feeds such as DomainTools to look for infrastructure objects fitting certain
patterns based on domain sub-characteristics. Using this methodology, the following domain came to light on 22 November
2022:
msn-imap[.]com

Even at first glance, this appears suspicious given naming conventions, spoofing a combination of MSN and IMAP services.
Further research, in this case using DomainTools Iris Investigate, shows further details that call this item out as likely
malicious:

We can spot several items that look suspicious here – anonymized registration, dedicated hosting (on IP address
92.38.135.213), suspicious authoritative name server use – but unfortunately there’s very little to pivot on to learn more about
this item (or identify related infrastructure) using just domain information.
We can dig further by looking at the hosting address. In this case, using Censys Search we can profile this further:

Now we’re starting to get more details on how this object might be used by an adversary, as well as other observables that
can be used for searching, hunting, and follow-on pivoting. Among other items, we’ve learned the following:
The adversary’s infrastructure characteristics:
Ubuntu Linux
Postfix SMTP server
Apache HTTP/HTTPS server
Use of Let’s Encrypt SSL/TLS certificates
JA3S hashes for various TLS services
Additional potential indicators, such as the domain onkrdot[.]info associated with the SMTP server

6/13

One item that immediately stands out is the SMTP server. Given our original domain’s email theme, we can hypothesize that
this server may be utilized for future phishing infrastructure or email relay activity. However, we also have HTTP/HTTPS
servers that appear active – but in a strange way. As seen in the above screenshot, an HTTPS request returns a status code
of 200 (success), but the page content (based on the HTML title) says “404 Not Found.” What is going on here?
To simplify our research, we can utilize another service – urlscan.io – to handle our interactions for us. And this serves up
something strange:

Website Capture from URLScan
This may seem unhelpful, but we’ve identified an interesting mismatch. Examination of the server through application
fingerprinting indicates we are interacting with an Apache webserver, while the server itself is displaying a custom webpage
modeled off of (but not exactly mirroring) an Ngnix webserver 404 landing page. While not a sign of obvious maliciousness,
this mismatch and customization provides an interesting foothold for further exploration. One easy follow-on item lies within
urlscan itself, where we can look for instances of similar landing pages based on the content hash of the delivered page –
9b43f670273b6a12b2b6894a9e29157c1859717594e98ccc5fb3eea05e71f4ed. This reveals something VERY interesting:

URLScan Pivot Results
We seem to have stumbled upon something reasonably unique, and linked to a variety of additional infrastructure – many of
which spoof a variety of legitimate services. Among the items covered in this, we can see:
Korean web portal Daum
Korean web portal Naver
Google services
Various mail, cloud, and certificate themes
Infrastructure is overwhelmingly concentrated in Korean or East Asian hosting providers, and all items appear to be created
between March and November 2022 (see Table 1 below for a list of all identified indicators).
Additionally, looking at pDNS records (in this case from VirusTotal) for the IP addresses from urlscan shows additional
infrastructure of interest likely linked to this campaign:

VirusTotal pDNS Information
At this stage we’ve collected a lot of information about various infrastructure created (and potentially used) in 2022 with
similar themes, characteristics, and other observables. Yet it is important not to lose overall context as to what we might be
looking at – so some external enrichment and research is required to learn more.
With no actual threat to go off of (yet), we can start our search looking for entities that typically host phishing infrastructure
(either for sending email, or as landing pages for links) in East Asia (and especially South Korea), that focus on spoofing
legitimate services with an emphasis on South Korean major web portals. Based on multiple reports from various entities,
one threat group stands out matching these characteristics: North Korean-related entity Kimsuky.
While we cannot be certain at this stage, based on an initial suspicious feeling around one suspect domain, we have
uncovered an entire ecosystem of related infrastructure that may be related to an in-progress Kimsuky-associated campaign,
likely with a focus on website spoofing and phishing. Defenders, especially those with reason to believe they may be targeted
by this North Korean-linked threat actor, should take the indicators provided in Table 1 and search historical logs to see if they
have interacted with any of these infrastructure items as an initial defensive measure. Going forward, threat intelligence
researchers can incorporate the characteristics in infrastructure creation documented in this report and the various linked
resources to build a new hunting-and-pivoting profile for infrastructure related to this entity. Overall, network indicator
research and refinement can yield fantastic results if you know both where to look, and what to look for.

Table 1 – Indicators Related To Identified Activity

Additional Research
One thing that bothers me about the above are the “N/A” items for hosting – so, I decided to do some pDNS lookups in
DomainTools to find out if there were subdomains hosted with these items. I was not disappointed:

Table 3 – pDNS Responses By IP Address
We can keep going back and forth between domains and IP addresses as long as we’d like, collecting indicators like so many
Pokémon. But more usefully, we continued to refine our understanding of adversary infrastructure creation tendencies.
Additionally, with the important caveat that pDNS data is not complete, we established rough timelines of when different
infrastructure items appear to be “active” – allowing us to guide defenders as to when activity was most likely to have
occurred.
Unfortunately, it appears most of the infrastructure identified is no longer “live.” But there’s more that we can do looking at
other resources. For example, we can attempt to find mappings to file objects through resources such as VirusTotal. Similar
to urlscan, we can search for the hash of the displayed, fake “404” page, which identifies additional items:

VirusTotal Result

For Fake Ngnix 404 Page

12/13

More interestingly, we can contingently verify that these campaigns are tied to credential theft via website spoofing by looking
at the full submitted URL for one of the domains in question:

URL Submitted To

VirusTotal
While we can’t completely confirm with available information, it does appear that there is a “passthrough” on the link that on
submission will redirect the user (or input) to the legitimate Gmail site.
Ideally, we would find a file – an email, a payload, or some other object – that would allow us to link the infrastructure to
follow-on capabilities. In this case, a cursory research effort fails to identify any such objects, limiting our ability to take this
further. But, if this actor – likely Kimsuky – is of interest to you, the following provides an interesting overview of how this actor
appears to utilize infrastructure to facilitate credential capture for services such as Google, Naver, Daum, and others.
