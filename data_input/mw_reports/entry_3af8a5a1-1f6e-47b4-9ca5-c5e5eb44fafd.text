Overview
1/10

As the current state of the war against Ukraine has been on everyone's mind for several
weeks by now, InQuest Labs has been following activity on the cyber-front proceeding as
well as moves made by APTs following the invasion of Ukraine. While the rest of the world is
seeing the effects of this escalation with rising fuel prices and supply line hiccups, Ukrainian
and Russian citizens alike are clinging onto their livelihoods due to the contempt of Russian
leaders. As many within the research community have ties to and/or may be personally
affected by this crisis, we felt it was necessary to share any information based on communal
efforts that may save lives and contribute to bringing this conflict to a peaceful resolution.
Our endeavor with this blog is to document and expose campaigns/associated TTPs as well
as provide periodic updates as the situation continues to develop and actors pivot to different
tactics. It is imperative that the global effort to contain and reduce the impact of Russian
state sponsored threats on the cyber-front does not waver, as further advances could mean
innocent lives lost given the current circumstances. Our hope is that the information provided
is able to bring those currently engaged in research efforts up to speed along with sparking
interest for able minds to join the ranks. True to the message that inspired the name
attributed one of the groups that will be covered, video here for the uninitiated (Warning:
Language), we are committed to aiding any efforts to stuff as many invading pockets with
sunflower seeds as needed to end this senseless war.
Initially, we published a blog on a delivery mechanism we dubbed GlowSpark, which can be
found here.
Next we decided to share an image via tweet that included a high level visual of the threat
landscape in an easily digestible format.

As the situation on the ground unfolded, so did developments on the cyber-front. The
following tweet was shared to showcase the expanding landscape. Comparing the two
graphics, we can see an uptick in threat actor activity targeting Ukraine. As seen in previous
Russian movements and occupations of sovereign territory, physical movements tend to
follow major pushes on the cyber-front, highlighting the value of threat actor support during
military operations. Usually in the form of disrupting lines of communication and/or
destabilizing regional infrastructure to "soften" the target for ground forces.

This last graphic is a condensed, "easy to swallow", form containing actors and threats
observed up to the point of publication. (2022-04-12) Below we briefly touch on the major
players and their roles in this conflict.

4/10

APT - SunFlowerSeed (NEARMISS/UNC-3715)
Threat activity produced by this actor leading to the physical invasion of Ukraine was the
catalyst for focusing on Russian state sponsored/supporting threats and acted as a call to
arms for the research community.
Hermetic Wiper (FoxBlade/Trojan.KillDisk)
Destructive malware with anti-forensic measures
Hermetic Wizard - A worm that containing wiper characteristics
Hermetic Ransom - Ransomware connected to PartyTicket and SonicVote

Ghostwriter/UNC-1151/TA445/UAC-0051 (Belarus MoD)
The current regime under Belarusian president Aleksandr Lukashenko has close relations to
Vladimir Putin and his administration, allowing for Belarusian state assets to be (allegedly)
deployed via their Ministry of Defense. The aim of this group is to operate disinformation
campaigns regarding NATO credibility; targeting primarily Russian, Ukrainian and Polish
speakers across different countries across Europe since 2017. Using spear-phishing tactics,
Ghostwriter targeted members of Ukraine’s armed forces to compromise their accounts and
reach out to their contacts to cover and aid more destructive attacks conducted to further
Russian state interests and the actions of associated APT groups.

5/10

MicroBackdoor
MicroBackdoor is an open source backdoor that is used for C2 communications.
This means anyone may use this tool for various purposes and not just for
attacks against Ukraine. Though extra features have been implemented by UAC0051 not included in the open source version.

Asylum Ambuscade
This phishing campaign was observed operating within similar parameters as
Ghostwriter/UNC-1151/TA445 activities, suggesting that this may be their work or the
campaign may be connected through other means. At the time of publication, there were
enough discrepancies to prevent conclusive attribution of this campaign to TA445. Primary
targets chosen by Asylum Ambuscade operators differ from TA445 attributed attacks where
TA445 pursued military personnel and organizations while Asylum Ambuscade set their
sights on European government entities whose responsibilities are tied to transportation and
logistics extending beyond military affairs such as refugee relief efforts.

APT28 (Fancy Bear)
This actor is attributed as the most prevalent and deeply connected of known Russian state
sponsored actors. Their connection to GRU, the Russian military intelligence agency tasked
with intelligence gathering and espionage beyond Russian territory alongside its civilian
counterpart SVR, lends credibility to their activities and attacks being directly aligned with
Russian state interests.
Spear-phishing has been associated with APT28 activity using high volumes of
compromised accounts along with newly created actor controlled infrastructure.
Activities directly related to the conflict in Syria, undermining Ukraine’s relations with
NATO/member nations, and the 2016 U.S presidential election.

Sandworm/VoodooBear (GRU)
This group is also tied to GRU and handles matters related to targeting entities in the energy
sector dating back to 2011. Along with espionage operations, Sandworm/VoodooBear is
known for destructive malware deployed against industrial control and SCADA systems such
as the 2015 attack against Ukraine’s energy sector leading to widespread blackouts.
CyclopsBlink - Malicious Elf (Linux) executable.
Compiled for 32-bit PowerPC architecture
Large-scale botnet targeting Small Office/Home Office network devices (routers)
Encrypted C2 communication
Persistence via device firmware upgrade process

6/10

Note: In early April 2022, the United States government secured a court order allowing
for the removal of the malware from infected devices.

UNC-2589 (UAC-0056/SaintBear/TA471/Lorec53)
This threat group has been connected to spearphishing attempts targeting both Georgian
and Ukrainian government entities using various malware. This group often targets
government and critical infrastructure and tends to align with Russian state objectives, but is
not confirmed with absolute certainty to be state sponsored.
Saint_v3 - Trojan
SaintBot - Malware Loader
OutSteel - Document Stealer
Elephant - Malware Framework
GrimPlant - GO Backdoor
GraphSteel - GO Backdoor
Cobalt Strike Beacon - Default malware payload for Cobalt Strike

AcidRain (Likely connected to Sandworm)
This threat is attributed to the ELF modem wiper malware that was observed in connection to
Viasat satellite attacks. Gaining access to Viasat’s KA-SAT management infrastructure,
attackers were able to push AcidRain to residential modems across Europe, effectively
denying internet access to regions reliant on high-throughput satellite telecom service due to
lack of traditional network infrastructure resources. As the various wipers seen prior to the
physical invasion shed light on cyber offensive efforts and capabilities against Ukraine,
AcidRain’s impact reaches across Europe as far as disrupting remote communications to
wind turbines in Germany. Along with surface level function similarities, AcidRain shares
resemblance to VPNFilter malware at the code level, the predecessor to Cyclops Blink
attributed to Sandworm. This suggests a deeper connection to Russian GRU assets rather
than state sponsored activity.
[Update: 2022-04-18] Sandworm connection with medium confidence

UAC–0020/Vermin Group/SPECTR [Update: 2022-04-18]
A hacker collective associated with the Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR), a breakaway
faction/self proclaimed state officially designated as a terrorist organization by Ukraine. The
Vermin group claims to represent "a security agency for the LPR" and has been linked to
cybercrime activities aligned with Russian state goals prior to and leading into the invasion of
Ukraine. This group is known for developing and deploying SPECTR malware, composed of
several components/modules; targeting Ukrainian state entities.

7/10

UAC-0026/Scarab (China)
This group has been operational since 2012, possibly earlier, and is connected to Chinese
threat actors that have used phishing emails with RAR attachments leading to HeaderTIP
malware. Prior to the invasion, this group was observed targeting individuals worldwide;
afterwards, setting their sites on targets within Ukraine using phishing lures bearing the
National Police of Ukraine graphics and contact details claiming to be collecting video
evidence of crimes committed by the Russian military.
Deployed custom backdoor “Scieron”, believed to be an earlier iteration of HeaderTIP
Observed to reuse C2 infrastructure from previous malware campaigns
Known to craft lures specific to an individual target’s locale

UAC-0035/InvisiMole/LoadEdge/TunnelMole [Update: 2022-04-18]
This group has been observed conducting spear phishing attacks targeting Ukraine state
organizations in accordance with Russian state aligned goals since 2013. Collaborative
efforts with Gamaredon have also been seen via campaign overlap and one of the groups
distributing payloads using distribution networks controlled by the other. InvisiMole is the
name attributed to the spyware used to target their victims, which historically, have been
Russian and Ukrainian military and diplomatic entities along with other organizations across
eastern Europe. LoadEdge is a backdoor written in C++, also used by the group with various
command and control capabilities. TunnelMole is the name attributed to their DNS tunnel
malware used to externally retrieve additional data/payloads along with exfiltrating data
covertly.

WhisperGate/DEV-0586
There are multiple WhisperGate campaigns as a result of overlap in attribution which is
common within the research community. The most commonly referenced campaign is that of
the destructive malware that corrupts an infected system’s master boot record and displays a
fake ransomware note as the data is destroyed and cannot be recovered by paying the
ransom. Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) saw systems in Ukraine becoming
infected on January 13, 2022; Likely done so in preparation for the ground invasion.

XakNet [Update: 2022-04-18]
This group is a hacker collective, composed of "Russian patriots" claiming to not hide behind
the "mask of Anonymous" and vowing to retaliate against attacks targeting Russia by
inflicting similar attacks against Ukrainian targets. Their most high profile act to date was
leaking documents from Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs "exposing" a request for foreign
aid in the form of equipment to protect from chemical exposure. Prior to the invasion of

8/10

Ukraine, this group openly advertised offering ethical hacking guidance and instruction;
Afterwards stating that they are no longer teaching and defending, shifting to offensive
efforts.

Gamaredon/PrimitiveBear/Armageddon/ACTINIUM/Shuckworm (FSB)
This actor has been actively targeting Ukrainian government entities since the “annex” of the
Crimean peninsula by Russian forces in 2013. Observed in connection to Russian appointed
FSB officers assigned to Crimea, the group gradually moved from deploying malware
authored by other developers to their own custom payloads. Campaigns attributed to the
actor show use of a combination of compromised Russian and Ukraine domains and IPs with
autonomous systems for related IPs being physically located in Russia. A notable technique
seen across their distribution network allows them to restrict access and requests with timed
gates set to expire when domains rotate to a new IP; signaling the end of a particular run and
impeding research efforts. Based on reports from the Security Service of Ukraine, the aim of
this group is to obtain intelligence information from Ukrainian security, defense and law
enforcement bodies via targeted campaigns.

CyberCrime:
In addition, we want to highlight crimeware activity, as many of these groups are associated
with Russian threat actors. It is very interesting that some of the physical infrastructure
utilized by cybercrime outfits are geographically located on U.S. soil and used against US
citizens (along with other civilian targets worldwide) to not only access, but also collect funds
that eventually end up back into the hands of Russian actors. Though previously the goal
was simply to profit from ill-gotten gains, priorities have presumably shifted towards providing
resources for Russian state assets.
Sanctions that were enacted onto Russia included a number of hosting providers as well as
general internet access. This caused a heavy blow as it seemed to present issues with what
some refer to as “commodity threats” that hit their inboxes daily such as IcedID, Dridex,
Hancitor, Qbot, Trickbot, etc. This was initially easing the burden for community individuals to
focus on other threats and make connections to less popular named threats along with
analysts that have to track all of this activity. The break was short lived and now we are
seeing these actors resume operations after some retooling on their infrastructure and/or
access to their boxes.

Parting Words:
Though this is not an exhaustive list, the content provided reveals enough to highlight where
our collective gaps lie and where efforts should be focused to undermine the efforts tied to
the Russian state. As previously mentioned, further developments will be added to this article
as the situation continues to unfold. Our list of sources below may include actors and threats

9/10

to be summarized later as we gather more information and form more concrete attributions.
Feel free to reach out to us with suggestions for content and information to include or
elaborate on. At the time of publication, Ukrainian morale stood high as Russian military
forces seemed to present itself as a paper tiger, especially in the face of the smaller
Ukrainian force backed by military aid from allied nations across the globe. It is critical that
global efforts on the cyber-front maintain the same unified stance if we hope to see this
conflict come to a swift end and prevent any potential escalations.
