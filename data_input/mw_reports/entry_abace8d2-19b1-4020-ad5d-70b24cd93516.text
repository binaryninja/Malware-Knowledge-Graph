PrivateLoader[1,2,3,4] continues to function as an effective loading service, recently
leveraging the use of SmokeLoader for their loads.
A recent sample of their SmokeLoader can be seen
here(b01195c3e828d9a79c958e4c810a363d804d51996337db89a5d248096846b27a), the
C2 domains for the sample are a hallmark for PrivateLoader:
host-file-host6.comhost-host-file8.com

1/6

These domains are simply proxies but behind them sits a massive operation performing
millions of loads for various customers. Recently a new customer has started leveraging this
service which caught our attention, in the aforementioned hash of SmokeLoader you can see
all the tasks being ran:

Ref: Virustotal.com
From the DNS resolutions we can see SmokeLoader checking in along with quite a lot of
other activity, some of them are related to tasks for the bot to load but the domain
‘deficulintersun[.]com’ is the C2 for an IcedID loader. Luckily Zenbox on VirusTotal left us with
a PCAP so we can decrypt the SmokeLoader traffic and hopefully recover the tasks.

So the group is pub3 and the version of the bot is 0x7e4 or 2020. The recovered tasks are as
follows:

SmokeLoader Tasks
The file I got from buildz.exe shows to be Djvu Ransomware, the more interesting part here
is that the ransomware sample was crypted with the same crypter used for the SmokeLoader
sample. Coupled with the fact that IcedID has been seen leading to ransomware itself,
potentially a conflict of interest going on here between the service provider and their
customers or competing customers?

The file from uploadgram, 62e817d1aff5ah, turns out be RedLine stealer:
{'C2': '193.233.193.14:8163', 'BOTNET': 'LogsDiller Cloud (Sup: @mr_golds)'}

The file from allejee was down at the time we found it but we did find same name files from
that server in VirusTotal:
03626471a65baf211f2110cd91e52b9e44524780e042a473cd09d864d9af20a0

Which has ITW URLs from the same server in July:

Ref:
This file is a self extracting EXE signed by ‘Nir Sofer’, the extracted EXE inside of it ends up
being a simple .NET based loader which will download and execute more .NET code,
eventually this leads to Racoon Stealer V2[5].

.NET based loader
The csflow.exe executable is an installer for CoinSurf which allows people to monetize their
traffic usage.
Finally the 7loader_exe_64.exe file is an IcedID loader:
{'C2': 'deficulintersun.com', 'Campaign': 1514253643}

PrivateLoader is not new to having some bigger names leveraging it as previous research
indicates it being leveraged by TrickBot, Qakbot, DanaBot and Dridex previously. The more
pressing question is why these groups would leverage a system that is actively stealing data
and dropping ransomware on top of their bots?
