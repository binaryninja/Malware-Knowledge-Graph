On January 26th, 2022, the ASEC analysis team has discovered that the Kimsuky group was
using the xRAT (Quasar RAT-based open-source RAT) malware.
xRAT Github Address: https://github.com/tidusjar/xRAT
According to the logs collected by AhnLab’s ASD (AhnLab Smart Defense) infrastructure, the
attacker installed a variant of Gold Dragon on the first infected PC on January 24th. The
basis for assuming that the obtained file is a variant of Gold Dragon is as follows:
Injection method is same as the method used by the original Gold Dragon (behavior of
process hollowing on iexplore.exe, svchost.exe,etc.)
Feature of terminating AhnLab product’s real-time detection window class (49B46336BA4D-4905-9824-D282F05F6576)
Termination of Daum Cleaner (daumcleaner.exe) process
The attacker installed Gold Dragon through the exclusive installer
(installer_sk5621.com.co.exe). The installer downloads Gold Dragon compressed in the form
of a Gzip file from the attacker’s server, decompresses it as “in[random 4 numbers].tmp” in
the %temp% path, then executes it via rundll32.exe.

1/5

The installed Gold Dragon has 4 export functions.
Perform
Process
Start
Work
The installer first executes Gold Dragon by giving the “Start” argument. Once the “Start”
export function is executed, Gold Dragon copies itself to a certain path and registers the
copied DLL to the autorun registry key. The “Perform” export function is given for DLL
execution argument.

It is assumed that the info leaking feature of the variant that was discovered was
modularized. The system information acquisition command execution feature that is mainly
used by Gold Dragon did not exist in the Gold Dragon variant. This means that additional
payloads can be downloaded from the attacker’s server to obtain system information.
cmd.exe /c ipconfig/all >>”%s” & arp -a >>”%s”
cmd.exe /c systeminfo >>”%s”
cmd.exe /c tasklist >>”%s”
The attacker does not obtain information through system processes, but instead additionally
installs xRAT (Filename: cp1093.exe) that allows remote control of the system to the infected
PC to perform info-stealing features. Once cp1093.exe is executed, it copies a normal
powershell process (powershell_ise.exe) to the “C:\ProgramData\”path and executes xRAT
via process hollowing technique.

The attacker was also meticulous enough to also distribute an additional file
(UnInstall_kr5829.co.in.exe) along with xRAT to delete the traces of attack existing in the
target PC.

AhnLab is constantly monitoring and responding to such APT attacks, and users should
refrain from opening attachments from emails from unknown sources and update the security
software to the latest version to prevent damage by information leakage.
