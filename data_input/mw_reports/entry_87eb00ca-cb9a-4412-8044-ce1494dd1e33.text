Webworm: Espionage Attackers Testing and Using Older
Modified RATs

Threat Hunter TeamSymantec
Symantec, by Broadcom Software, has gained insight into the current activities of a group we
call Webworm. The group has developed customized versions of three older remote access
Trojans (RATs), including Trochilus, Gh0st RAT, and 9002 RAT. At least one of the indicators
of compromise (IOCs) observed by Symantec was used in an attack against an IT service
provider operating in multiple Asian countries, while others appear to be in pre-deployment
or testing stages.

Webworm
Symantec’s Webworm has links to a group dubbed Space Pirates, which was previously
documented in a May 2022 report from Positive Technologies. It is likely that the two groups
are one and the same.

1/6

Active since at least 2017, Webworm has been known to target government agencies and
enterprises involved in IT services, aerospace, and electric power industries located in
Russia, Georgia, Mongolia, and a number of other Asian countries.
Previous research on the group’s activity found that it uses custom loaders hidden behind
decoy documents and modified backdoors that have been around for quite some time. This
corresponds with recent Webworm activity observed by Symantec.
Malware used by Webworm includes versions of the following threats:
Trochilus RAT
First spotted back in 2015, Trochilus is a RAT implemented in C++ and its source code is
available for download on GitHub. The malware has been used in targeted threat operations
by multiple groups and has features that can help it evade sandbox analysis and be useful in
cyber-espionage operations. The RAT’s features include, but are not limited to, the ability to
remotely uninstall a file manager, and the ability to download, upload, and execute files.
Trochilus has been previously linked to malware operations from threat actors also using
malware such as PlugX and a variant of the 9002 RAT.
9002 RAT
The 9002 RAT appears to have been in use since at least 2009 and has historically been
used by state-sponsored actors. The malware provides attackers with extensive data
exfiltration capabilities. Some variants of 9002 RAT inject into memory and do not write to the
disk, something that also applies to the sample analyzed by Symantec.
The malware has been used in multiple campaigns by a range of actors, including in a
hacking operation targeting several large corporations located in South Korea. The RAT was
used to deliver additional malware, including the PlugX RAT, onto compromised machines. It
has also been involved in attacks making use of zero-day exploits.
Gh0st RAT
While the source code for Gh0st RAT was released online in 2008, the malware has
continued to be used by advanced persistent threat (APT) groups.
Gh0st RAT first made headlines back in 2009, when a cyber-espionage group called
GhostNet used it to target diplomatic, political, economic, and military targets around the
world.

Observed Webworm activity
Symantec observed three malware droppers developed by Webworm:

(Trochilus Dropper)
Analysis of one of the droppers revealed that it drops the following files:
[TEMP]\Logger.exe
(28d78e52420906794e4059a603fa9f22d5d6e4479d91e9046a97318c83998679)

(a6b9975bfe02432e80c7963147c4011a4f7cdb9baaee4ae8d27aaff7dff79c2b)
[TEMP]\logexts.dll
(a73a4c0aa557241a09e137387537e04ce582c989caa10a6644d4391f00a836ef)
[TEMP]\logger.dat
(10456bc3b5cfd2f1b1ab9c3833022ef52f5e9733d002ab237bdebad09b125024)
[TEMP]\[RANDOM_DIGITS].doc
(d295712185de2e5f8811b0ce7384a04915abdf970ef0f087c294bb00e340afad)
The legitimate executable Logger.exe is used to call the “LoadLibraryA” API in order to load
the malicious "[TEMP]\logexts.dll" file.
Thelogexts.dll file is a loader. Once run, it checks the process command-line parameters. If
the command-line is the single parameter "isdf", it attempts to steal a token from the
"WINLOGON.EXE" process. It then starts the following process by calling the
CreateProcessAsUserW API:
C:\ProgramData\Logger\Logger.exe mdkv
Otherwise it constructs the pathname of the second stage based on its own running
executable, where it replaces the last three characters with hardcoded "dat" (resulting with
"Logger.dat"). Then it reads and executes the second stage as shellcode.
The second stage ("Logger.dat") constructs the pathname of the third stage also based on its
own running executable, where it combines the directory part with hardcoded "logexts.dat".
Finally, it reads and executes the third stage.
Thelogexts.dat file is obfuscated and includes several User Account Control (UAC)
bypasses.
It attempts to copy the previously dropped files to the following new locations:

3/6

[Temp]\Logger.exe to C:\ProgramData\Logger\Logger.exe
[Temp]\Logger.dat to C:\ProgramData\Logger\logger.dat
[Temp]\logexts.dll to C:\ProgramData\Logger\logexts.dll
[Temp]\logexts.dat to C:\ProgramData\Logger\logexts.dat
[Temp]\sc.cfg to C:\ProgramData\Logger\sc.cfg
Then the file unpacks and executes in memory its backdoor payload, a variant of the
Trochilus RAT
(e69177e58b65dd21e0bbe4f6caf66604f120e0c835f3ee0d16a45858f5fe9d90).
The Trochilus modifications include functionality to load its configuration from a file by
checking for any of the following locations (in order of preference):
C:\ProgramData\Logger\sc.cfg
C:\ProgramData\resmon.resmoncfg
C:\ProgramData\appsoft\resmon.resmoncfg
The content of the configuration file is decompressed using the Lempel–Ziv–Welch (LZW)
algorithm.
Interestingly, one of the locations described above (“C:\ProgramData\resmon.resmoncfg”) is
mentioned in third-party research detailing previous Space Pirates (Webworm) activity.
The malware then injects svchost.exe with the ability to:
Execute commands
Download potentially malicious files
Further investigation by Symantec found that droppers that share a similar structure to the
one used to deploy the version of Trochilus RAT modified by Webworm were also used to
deploy two additional modified versions of Gh0st RAT and 9002 RAT. Some code
modifications made to the variant of Trochilus RAT were also present in the two additional
retooled RATs. The additional RATs included:
Gh0st RAT:

9002 RAT:

backdoor)
Changes made by Webworm to this version of 9002 RAT are apparently intended to evade
detection. For example, the details of the RAT’s communication protocol, such as encryption,
have also been modified by the threat actors.
Gh0st RAT (BH_A006) was documented in third-party research detailing previous Webworm
(Space Pirates) activity. In that research, the version of Gh0st RAT included features such as
layers of obfuscation to bypass security protections and hinder analysis, network service
creation, UAC bypassing, and shellcode unpacking and launching in the memory. Some of
these features were also present in the version of the RAT being prepared by Webworm.

Conclusion
Webworm’s use of customized versions of older, and in some cases open-source, malware,
as well as code overlaps with the group known as Space Pirates, suggest that they may be
the same threat group. However, the common use of these types of tools and the exchange
of tools between groups in this region can obscure the traces of distinct threat groups, which
is likely one of the reasons why this approach is adopted, another being cost, as developing
sophisticated malware can be expensive in terms of both money and time.
