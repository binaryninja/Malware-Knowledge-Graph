TrickBot Gang Likely Shifting Operations to Switch to New
Malware

TrickBot, the infamous Windows crimeware-as-a-service (CaaS) solution that's used by a variety of
threat actors to deliver next-stage payloads like ransomware, appears to be undergoing a transition
of sorts, with no new activity recorded since the start of the year.
The lull in the malware campaigns is "partially due to a big shift from Trickbot's operators, including
working with the operators of Emotet," researchers from Intel 471 said in a report shared with The
Hacker News.
The last set of attacks involving TrickBot were registered on December 28, 2021, even as
command-and-control (C2) infrastructure associated with the malware has continued to serve
additional plugins and web injects to infected nodes in the botnet.

Interestingly, the decrease in the volume of the campaigns has also been accompanied by the
TrickBot gang working closely with the operators of Emotet, which witnessed a resurgence late last
year after a 10-month-long break following law enforcement efforts to tackle the malware.
The attacks, which were first observed in November 2021, featured an infection sequence that used
TrickBot as a conduit to download and execute Emotet binaries, when prior to the takedown,
Emotet was often used to drop TrickBot samples.
"It's likely that the TrickBot operators have phased TrickBot malware out of their operations in favor
of other platforms, such as Emotet," the researchers said. "TrickBot, after all, is relatively old
malware that hasn't been updated in a major way."
Additionally, Intel 471 said it observed instances of TrickBot pushing Qbot installs to the
compromised systems shortly after Emotet's return in November 2021, once again raising the
possibility of a behind-the-scenes shake-up to migrate to other platforms.
With TrickBot increasingly coming under the lens of law enforcement in 2021, it's perhaps not too
surprising that the threat actor behind it is actively attempting to shift tactics and update their
defensive measures.

According to a separate report published by Advanced Intelligence (AdvIntel) last week, the Conti
ransomware cartel is believed to have acqui-hired several elite developers of TrickBot to retire the
malware and switch to upgraded variants such as BazarBackdoor.
"Perhaps a combination of unwanted attention to TrickBot and the availability of newer, improved
malware platforms has convinced the operators of TrickBot to abandon it," the researchers noted.
"We suspect that the malware control infrastructure (C2) is being maintained because there is still
some monetization value in the remaining bots."
