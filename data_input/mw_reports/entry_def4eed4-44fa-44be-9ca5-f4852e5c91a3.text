Manufacturing and Transportation Networks
blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/07/valak-emerges.html

Threat summary

1/21

Attackers are actively distributing the Valak malware family around the globe, with
enterprises, in particular, being targeted.
These campaigns make use of existing email threads from compromised accounts to
greatly increase success.
The additional use of password-protected ZIP files can create a blind spot in security
protections.
The overwhelming majority of campaigns occurred over the last couple of months and
targeted organizations in the financial, manufacturing, health care and insurance
verticals.

Executive summary
Valak is a modular information-stealer that attackers have deployed to various countries
since early-to-mid 2019. While Valak features a robust feature set, it is often observed
alongside secondary malware payloads, including Gozi/Ursnif and IcedID. This malware is
typically delivered via malicious spam email campaigns that leverage password-protected
ZIP archives to evade detection by email security solutions that may inspect the contents of
emails entering corporate networks. While previous analysis focused on campaigns targeting
the United States and Germany, Cisco Talos has observed ongoing campaigns targeting
other geographic regions including countries in North America, South America, Europe and
likely others. The email campaigns distributing downloaders associated with Valak also
appear to be leveraging existing email threads to lend credibility to the emails and increase
the likelihood that victims will open file attachments and initiate the Valak infection process.

What's new?
Valak is a relatively new stealer that has greatly increased its distribution over the last
several months. By using stolen email threads and password-protected ZIP files, Valak has
enjoyed success compromising enterprises. Research shows that organizations are targeted
repeatedly by Valak in hopes of monetary gain.

How did it work?
Valak is spread through malspam campaigns. What makes this threat unique is its repeated
use of stolen email threads. By replying to existing conversations with their targets, the
actors behind Valak greatly increased their success rate. Finally, the email attachments are
password-protected, preventing content analysis and inspection prior to reaching a user's
desktop.

So what?
2/21

The campaigns we analyzed have targeted major organizations in verticals such as energy,
health care, finance, manufacturing and insurance. These targets need to be aware that
existing email threads are being hijacked with success and organizations will need to decide
how to address emails with password-protected attachments, if they accept them at all. As
we continue to get better at detecting and blocking spam messages adversaries will continue
to move to novel approaches, like email thread hijacking.

Malspam campaigns
In most of the email campaigns observed, the emails consist of a reply message within an
existing email thread. In some cases, the previous messages in the email threads were
several years old. The emails reference an attached ZIP archive and provide a password
that can be used to extract the contents of the archive.
In our analysis, we've identified a couple of patterns to highlight. One of the most important
findings is how this group appears to be targeting its victims. During our research, we found
Valak targeting financial, manufacturing, insurance and transportation organizations. This
included multiple attempts to deliver malspam from different sources. Please note that due to
the use of stolen email threads, the emails are heavily redacted to protect the privacy of all
parties involved.

3/21

Financials targeted
In this example, we will walk through emails observed over the course of a week directed at
a single financial institution. The modus operandi for this group is to use stolen/hijacked
email threads to send reply emails to target organizations. Below is the first example we saw
directed at the financial institution in question.

This email arrived early in the morning and was a response to an email from a couple of
months earlier, in late February. Note the basic body, with a password-protected ZIP file. As
is also common with these attacks, email signatures are also present. A few hours later,
several other emails arrived — all from the same compromised email account. Each of these
emails is addressed to a single unique recipient. This is something else we commonly saw
— if there was an email thread with many participants, the actors chose to send a single
email message to each user instead of replying to all or sending a single email to multiple
targets.

4/21

The second email is similar to the first with one notable exception. This is a response from
an email sent more than two years ago, in late March 2018. This was the first indicator that
these actors are hunting through the email accounts they have compromised looking for
ways to effectively target potential victims. Throughout the day, the emails would continue
from this one email account.

5/21

The third email received was associated with an email thread from December 2017, but
again is a response to an existing email thread that this particular email account had with the
target.

This final email from this account was a reply dating back to March 2018. The compromised
account in question was associated with a real estate company, so the emails ranged from
information about properties and financing to showings and general friendly emails between
associates. This highlights why these campaigns can have a high success rate: They are
sent from existing email threads between colleagues or acquaintances. This simple change
will greatly increase the likelihood of success. This combined with password-protected ZIP
files can defeat a lot of email security and increase the likelihood of the email hitting the
target's inbox.
However, this particular email account was not the only one attempting to compromise this
bank. We found several other examples that were received later that same day. This second
batch of requests shows a group that isn't looking for the best quality email threads to reply
to.

6/21

In the case above, the adversaries hijacked an automated email sent by LinkedIn after two
users connect. Where the previous examples were tied to more robust email threads, this is
an example of a less sophisticated attempt to compromise the same financial institution.

In this next example, on that same date, another email account was used to try and lure the
victim to infect themselves with Valak. This particular thread was personal and associated
with raffle prize winnings, again not necessarily the most effective avenue of attack, but
these actors are opportunistic and appear to be willing to try multiple lures against a target
organization, regardless of the sophistication or relevance to the intended recipient.
These actors were not done trying to compromise this particular organization. Later in the
week, we observed another attempt, this time originating from the account of an IT
consultant.

7/21

This final example was in reference to an ongoing IT project the consultant was involved in,
as you can imagine this could be an increasingly effective lure.
Over the course of our investigation, we found 14 unique emails sent over a period of 10
days. These emails were associated with eight different compromised email accounts and
addressed a wide variety of topics, again reiterating the actors' use of all emails they can find
associated with a specific target, in this case, a financial institution.

Insurer targeted
Financial institutions weren't the only organizations we observed being targeted by Valak
campaigns. We also observed large insurance companies being targeted as well. In this
example, an insurer was targeted using a variety of different avenues. These included
responses to affidavit email threads from compromised email accounts at law firms, as
shown below.

8/21

This is a response to an email that was generated by a state court system. By abusing a
lawyer's email account, the attackers are again increasing the likelihood of success as
lawyers will commonly send documents to clients, co-workers, and other colleagues.
Other examples of lures sent to the insurer include personal threads related to religious
activities around the holidays and even individual users emailing about their respective
policies with their insurance agents, an example of which is shown below. In the case of the
insurer, we found more than 20 emails sent over a period of several weeks from eight
different email accounts. This again reinforces how organizations are being targeted by
these Valak campaigns.

9/21

These are just a handful of the email messages that we saw being abused by these actors.
One thing to note about the law firm mentioned above is that during our research we found
that several of the email accounts at that firm were being used to target a variety of
organizations, including other law firms. This does indicate that at least some of these emails
may be associated with larger longer-term compromises.

Password protected attachment usage
One commonality to all the observed Valak campaigns is the use of password-protected
attachments. There is an obvious tradeoff for the adversary in using these methods. By
password protecting the ZIP file they will bypass a lot of detection technologies, but it may
also decrease effectiveness. During our investigation we were able to find examples of these
malspam messages being forwarded around an organization and, in some cases to internal
IT support personnel, to try and determine how to extract the contents. This really illustrates
two points. The first is that it was able to bypass what email security, if any, was present at
the enterprises in question. Additionally, it shows that not all users are savvy enough to open
password-protected attachments and it may limit users, who would otherwise be susceptible
to this attack, from being able to infect themselves.

10/21

During the investigation, we observed that the same passwords were often leveraged across
multiple targets and malspam campaigns and did not appear to be specific to any individual
organization.

Languages targeted
In the examples to this point, we focused on the English-language campaigns we uncovered.
However, English was not the only language we found attackers leveraging. We also
identified several other campaigns, including campaigns in German, like one targeting a
transportation organization. An email associated with this German campaign is shown below.

One interesting note related to the campaign in German, many of the threads they were
leveraging were in English, but the malicious reply message was always in German,
something that would likely stand out to potential victims.
In addition to German campaigns, we also found some targeting email threads in Spanish. In
this case, the threads were in Spanish, but the malspam responses were in English, an
example of which you can find below. Please note that I have left the salutations in the
emails to denote the use of Spanish, as the majority of the text needs to be redacted.

11/21

Evidence of consumer targeting
While the majority of the emails we have observed distributing Valak are tied to enterprises,
they are not the only targets. During our investigation, we found examples of attempts being
made against personal email accounts, and in some cases, the adversaries made some poor
choices as to which emails to respond to. This shows a divergent approach from what we
saw in some of the more targeted emails, including accurate signature blocks and replying to
relevant threads.
As an example of one of these failures, we show here the actors responding to what is
obviously dating spam, trying to entice the user to send an email to a third email account for
further compromise. The Valak distributors still tried to respond as if it were a legitimate
email, showing that the automation they are using has its faults.

12/21

In another email mistake, the actors actually responded to what is clearly pharmaceutical
spam and is not even a remotely legitimate email thread.

There were a handful of other obvious spam messages that these actors replied to, during
these campaigns. It is worth noting that these messages make up a much smaller
percentage than those we saw targeting larger enterprises.

13/21

However, it does point to two separate campaigns that may be ongoing. One that is targeting
specific organizations with an array of email messages from multiple different accounts and
another that appears to be responding to a wide array of emails directed at end-users,
without much consideration for what thread the reply originated from.

Initial infection process
As previously mentioned, the emails associated with these distribution campaigns feature the
use of password-protected ZIP archives. By encrypting the contents of the email
attachments, the attackers can ensure that content inspection and detection capabilities are
unable to properly evaluate them. This also allows them to evade some automated analysis
environments like sandboxes, as user interaction is required to decrypt the ZIP archives.
Microsoft Word documents inside these ZIP archives are used to initiate the Valak infection.
Most of the documents analyzed feature the use of similar decoy images as the document in
the example below, however, they were localized with different language sets being used to
display a message to potential victims, instructing them to enable macros.

When enabled, the embedded VBA macros function as a downloader and handle retrieving
and executing the DLL associated with Valak.

14/21

The URL used to retrieve the malicious DLL has been obfuscated.

The previous series of arrays contain the URL hosting the malicious DLL as well as the local
storage location where the DLL will be stored:

The DLL is then retrieved from an attacker-controlled web server using UrlDownloadToFileA.

The DLL is then registered using regsvr32.exe, which initiates the Valak infection process.
The infection process has been covered extensively here and here. Valak is a continuously
evolving, modular malware family that features robust capabilities and is successful at
infecting systems across the various geographic regions targeted by these attackers. Over
the past few weeks, Cisco Talos observed multiple changes to the way in which Valak is
retrieved, as well as an increase in the level of obfuscation in the configuration file used by
the malware's later stages. Recently, it appears that Valak is also leveraging compromised
CMS servers to distribute the initial Valak DLL, an example of which is below:
http://digifish3[.]com/blog/wp-content/themes/busify/_eWTFIH4ngoi2PJUl.php?
x=MDAwMSBskYeC02Ql3VG8Ae9TVFHu6uY34q-zd5ISLrA1LlMNJ88yi_SVZUlkWiyyC9gmFThkFMVkHIlaIDSlZPLLzSuvVgZWgWuujIh-VCBWg50AL-jKfRnl38NNw89_MLBalU19J9qyusiuA_X0pqC

15/21

As previous analysis focused on the infection process itself, we will focus on analyzing the
characteristics associated with the distribution and C2 infrastructure associated with this
threat.

Campaign analysis

Spam volume and victimology
Talos was able to track the campaigns back to early 2020, with a couple of samples from
early in the year. However, the activity really appeared to explode over the last several
months. As you can see below the activity in May and early June accounted for more 95% of
the overall Valak activity.

16/21

The Valak campaigns aren't marked with huge amounts of emails but given that they are
curating the emails they are sending from existing email threads, it makes logical sense. This
use of stolen email threads and password-protected ZIPs has been successful for the group
delivering Valak, so the likelihood of imposters is relatively high.

Valak distribution servers
During the analysis of Valak distribution infrastructure, we observed DNS updates being
made frequently as new campaigns were launched by attackers. To track the movement of
malicious domains across the attacker infrastructure, Passive DNS data was used to track
the servers being used to deliver the initial Valak DLL to victims.

17/21

We discovered that a large portion of the infrastructure used to deliver the initial DLL was
hosted across a relatively small number of hosting providers with servers primarily located in
Russia and Ukraine.

Valak C2 servers
In addition to the infrastructure being used for the initial distribution of the DLL associated
with Valak, infected systems also communicate with C2 servers to transfer information and
attempt to obtain additional modules and instructions to perform. In analyzing the C2
infrastructure associated with various Valak campaigns, we observed the same infrastructure
associated with a myriad of other malicious activities. Additionally, in multiple instances,
passive DNS telemetry indicates that some of the systems used for C2 may have also been
leveraged as part of the MyKings and Dark Cloud botnets, however, this may be coincidental
and not intentional on the part of the attackers.
While the majority of the servers used to distribute the initial Valak DLL files were hosted in a
relatively small number of different geographic regions, the C2 servers used to administer the
botnet were spread out across a larger number of regions. Many of the servers were hosted
in the United States. Below is a high-level overview of the geographic region of the servers
used for C2.

18/21

The campaigns associated with Valak appear to be relatively successful, likely because of
perimeter security controls being unable to scan the initial attachments being sent to
potential victims. Below is a graph showing the DNS activity from systems likely infected with
Valak attempting to communicate with one of the Valak C2 servers. As soon as the
distribution campaigns that leveraged this domain became active, infected systems
immediately began beaconing. Due to the way that C2 has been implemented, infected
systems are continuously establishing connections to malicious infrastructure, creating a
consistent amount of DNS-related traffic.

Conclusion
In a world where malspam is constantly being created and sent, the goal is to get to inboxes.
We as an industry are always getting better at detecting malspam and adversaries are
always going to be looking for ways to move ahead. We've seen with Emotet before and now

19/21

with Valak that stolen email is an effective way to increase not only the likelihood of getting to
a user's inbox but the user is going to be receptive of the malspam.
Once you combine that with the use of password-protected ZIP files, the effect can be quite
successful. As we've shown throughout this blog these Valak campaigns have proceeded
and the resulting command and control traffic indicates, it's been productive. This puts
organizations in a tough position. The use of stolen email threads means that the emails are
unlikely to be blocked based on content and the use of password-protected ZIPs, prevents
most scanning. Organizations need to make a decision on whether or not they want to allow
password-protected files to be sent via email. Depending on the vertical and the
organization, this may or may not be a valid option for mitigation.
By allowing password-protected files to be sent via email, endpoint security largely becomes
the final bastion before a compromise occurs. This key technology is only getting more
important as encryption on the wire and sophisticated evasion become standard. Enterprises
need to also be adjusting hunting activities to look at what appears to be legitimate email
threads and potentially isolating all unscannable files received via email or through other
means.
