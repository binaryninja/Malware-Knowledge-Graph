Just like Wifatch and Hajime, the BrickerBot malware is the work of a vigilante grey-hat,
who goes online by the name of Janit0r, a nickname he chose on the Hack Forums
discussion boards.
If you're unfamiliar, BrickerBot is a new malware family that was first identified at the start of
the month by Radware researchers. The malware made headlines because it was the first
threat of its kind that intentionally bricked IoT and networking devices, by rewriting the flash
storage space of affected devices with random data.
Such actions rendered troves of devices useless, many needing a firmware reinstall, but as
many needing to be replaced altogether.
Destructive actions like these caught the attention of authorities. In the US, the Department
of Homeland Securityâ€™s Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICSCERT) issued an official alert last week, warning companies to disable Telnet and SSH
access to their devices and asking owners to change their devices' default factory
passwords.

Anonymous tip leads us to Hack Forums profile
Since BrickerBot's appearance, law enforcement and the infosec community have been on
the hunt for new information regarding how BrickerBot operates and who's behind it.
New information surfaced over the Easter weekend when Bleeping Computer received an
anonymous tip about the online identity of BrickerBot's creator. The tipster pointed us
towards the profile of a Hack Forums user named janit0r.

We ignored the tip at first since Hack Forums is known to attract a crowd of braggadocio
hackers, many of whom tend to "embellish" their abilities or knowledge. We expected that
that two weeks after BrickerBot's discovery, Hack Forums would be abuzz with people
trying to take credit for BrickerBot, but it was strangely silent.
On Monday, feeling bad that we did not follow through with the same dilligence that the
tipster had warned us with, we decided to have another look over janit0r's profile.
What we discovered was a user that registered on January 21, 2017, had the forum boards
set up to use the Alaska timezone and had made four posts.
Right off the bat, his first post was the most interesting one. In a forum topic discussing a
decline in the number of active Mirai bots, Janit0r made the following statement. Remind
you, this still almost two months and a half before Radware's BrickerBot discovery.
I have killed over 200K telnet devices since Nov.. you've probably seen a drop in your bot
counts by now.

His second and third posts also came before BrickerBot became public and attested to his
skills as a reverse engineer, in a topic he started himself, discussing a security flaw in
Dahua 2nd and 3rd generation IP cameras.
The researcher who discovered and made public the flaw, withheld proof-of-concept exploit
code for one month, to give Dahua customers time to apply a firmware update. Janit0r
showed dissatisfaction with the researcher's action and published exploitation details for
that particular bug himself.

His last post was in a topic started by a user who "heard" that BrickerBot's source had
leaked. Janit0r's response was quick and to the point.
I'm gonna call bullshit on this rumor.. I'm pretty sure I'd be sitting in jail if someone had
managed to snatch the full source off my desktop :P

At this point, we had to confirm that Janit0r was indeed BrickerBot's author and not just
some guy bragging on Hack Forums. This is how we spent the next two days, scraping
through the Dark Web, underground hacking forums, and getting in contact with a few
threat intelligence analysts we knew.
By Wednesday, we didn't manage to find any other clue of Janit0r's existence, or anybody
else claiming to be BrickerBot's author, with some solid proof on his side. That's when we
just gave up, and launched a desperate tweet, asking BrickerBot's author to reach out.

BrickerBot's Author reaches out
Lo and behold, this was exactly what happened. The same day, we received an email from
a person claiming to be BrickerBot's creator.
The email contained lots of details about BrickerBot's operation and internal structure.
Nevertheless, at this point, we knew that there could be the possibility that someone was
pulling a prank.
Chance had it that someone else had also seen our tweet. That person was Victor Gevers,
a security researcher mostly known for tracking the destructive ransom attacks against
MongoDB and other databases.
In the Bleeping Computer article that broke the news of BrickerBot's existence, we asked
Victor for his expert opinion on this new malware's behavior and repercussions. Victor not
only put BrickerBot in perspective for our readers, but also asked BrickerBot's creator to
reach out and discuss an alternative method of dealing with unsecured IoT devices, instead
of blindly destroying people's property.
Unknown to all was that BrickerBot author had reached out to Victor hours after our article
went live. The two had shared notes and Victor was acting as an intermediary between
Janit0r and various CERTs. All the operational details shared with us on Wednesday were
the same Janit0r shared with Victor in the previous three weeks, confirming we were
speaking with the same person.

"Yes, I am janit0r"
"Yes, I was janit0r on Hackforums," the BrickerBot author started his email, which then
continued with Janit0r showing his anger at the sad state of affairs in the realm of IoT
security.
Like so many others I was dismayed by the indiscriminate DDoS attacks by IoT botnets in
2016. I thought for sure that the large attacks would force the industry to finally get its act
together, but after a few months of record-breaking attacks it became obvious that in spite
of all the sincere efforts the problem couldn't be solved quickly enough by conventional
means.
The IoT security mess is a result of companies with insufficient security knowledge
developing powerful Internet-connected devices for users with no security knowledge. Most
of the consumer-oriented IoT devices that I've found on the net appear to have been
deployed almost exactly as they left the factory.
For example 9 out of every 10 Avtech IP cameras that I've pulled the user db from were set
up with the default login admin/admin! Let that statistic sink in for a second.. and then
consider that if somebody launched a car or power tool with a safety feature that failed 9
times out of 10 it would be pulled off the market immediately. I don't see why dangerously
designed IoT devices should be treated any differently and after the Internet-breaking
attacks of 2016 nobody can seriously argue that the security of these devices isn't
important.
I hope that regulatory bodies will do more to penalize careless manufacturers since market
forces can't fix this problem. The reality of the market is that technically unskilled consumers
will get the cheapest whitelabel DVR they can find at their local store, then they'll ask their
nephew to plug it into the Internet, and a few minutes later it'll be full of malware. At least
with 'BrickerBot' there was some brief hope that such dangerous devices could become the
merchant's and manufacturer's problem rather than our problem.

BrickerBot allegely wiped over two million devices
I joined Hackforums in January mainly to see if my activities had been noticed by the botnet
kids. Back then 200,000 bricked units seemed like a lot and I was sure I was close to the
end of it. Now when the count is over 2 million it's clear that I had no idea (and still have no
idea) how deep the rabbit hole of IoT insecurity is. I'm certain that the worst is still ahead of
us.
I hope the unconventional actions by 'BrickerBot' have helped in buying another year of
time for governments, vendors and the industry in general to get the current IoT security
nightmare under control.

Many other people have also done important things to combat IoT malware (Team White,
Hajime author, @packetcop and his fellow sinkholers, etc) so I'm by no means claiming
credit for Mirai being weak in Q1/2017, but if Imeij and Amnesia have suffered a little
recently then it's probably mainly my fault ;)
Janit0r's email then goes on to detail a few operational details regarding BrickerBot's
infrastructure, also dispelling the notion that he's a madman set on the random destruction
of IoT devices.
In reality, Janit0r wants to be considered in the same class as the White Team, the selfproclaimed white-hat hackers behind the Wifatch malware, and the author of the Hajime
malware, another vigilante who created a new malware family last October that tries to
secure IoT devices by force.
The Radware writeup made 'BrickerBot' sound simplistic, but it actually carries 86 protocol
and device-specific payloads and is relatively successful at mitigating commonly exploited
devices. The bot's every action has a statistically determined purpose and what might've
seemed like buggy behavior in the honeypot really isn't.
As a preference 'BrickerBot' will try to secure units without damaging them and the bricking
behavior is a 'plan B' (yes the B stands for brick :) for units which are unlikely to be
securable. A blogger on the net wondered about 'BrickerBot' simply trying to change his
honeypot's login and this would've been due to the bot assuming the device had a
persistent user db. Because the honeypots are often quite different from any actual devices
the behaviors in them are usually weird.
If security researchers made their honeypots look more like actual devices (that one could
actually find with default credentials on the net) and hosted them on dirtier networks they
would find even more interesting things going on..
Victor Gevers, who confirmed Janit0r's bricking statistics also believes this person is only
misguided, and hopes to convince him to abandon his ways. "The writer of the email does
not strike me as a bad person," Gevers told Bleeping Computer based on his own
communications with Janit0r. "Just some young guy who was too eager to solve a problem."

Janit0r wants a change in IoT security standards
For the time being, Janit0r doesn't seem interested in stopping BrickerBot attacks, or at
least not until officials and hardware vendors take a look at IoT security and start changing
things with a hurry.
Authorities have been talking about IoT security standards for years, but in the meantime,
some of the same vendors participating in those discussions have continued to ship out
insecure devices with the same ol' default passwords. In a follow-up email, Janit0r wrote the
following.

I consider my project a form of "Internet Chemotherapy" I sometimes jokingly think of myself
as The Doctor. Chemotherapy is a harsh treatment that nobody in their right mind would
administer to a healthy patient, but the Internet was becoming seriously ill in Q3 and
Q4/2016 and the moderate remedies were ineffective. The side effects of the treatment
were harmful but the alternative (DDoS botnet sizes numbering in the millions) would have
been worse. I can only hope hope that when the IoT relapse comes we'll have better ways
to deal with it. Besides getting the number of IoT DDoS bots to a manageable level my
other key goal has been to raise awareness. The IoT problem is much worse than most
people think, and I have some alarming stories to tell.

Janit0r is a wanted man
Nonetheless, the actions of BrickerBot place this malware in the same category as other
destructive e-threats, such as ransomware and banking trojans. Janit0r already knows he's
a wanted man and has taken many precautions.
Tracking down Janit0r's real life persona may also be a little harder than going after
teenagers that rent DDoS botnets with their father's credit card. While he signed his Hack
Forums posts with the name "Rob," Janit0r also used different names within each email,
said he never intends to log into his Janit0r Hack Forums account again, and has
consistently changed email addresses every few days.
For what's worth it, Janit0r has been very careful with his OpSec, compared to many of
today's hackers, who, according to a Flashpoint report released yesterday, prefer Skype as
their main communications method, an IM service known to give up data on its users to law
enforcement.

Janit0r: I'm not a security researcher
Current clues like Janit0r's reverse engineering skills, in-depth knowledge of the malware
scene, and a desire to do good, point to the fact that we may be dealing with another
security researcher or network engineer that has decided to do something about the everincreasing number of unsecured network and IoT devices.
"For what it's worth I'll state that I've never actually worked in networking, systems
administration, information security or anything of the sort, but I have a hobby interest in all
of the above. I believe that basic knowledge in such things is good self-defense in the 21st
century," Janit0r wrote in an email.
Right now, all users and companies can do is to follow Radware and ICS-CERT's
recommendations, and block access to Telnet and SSH ports, and also change the device's
default password. Otherwise, they may get a visit from BrickerBot, and it might reach Plan
B.

It would be interesting to know what actions are taken before PLAN B... Quickly
browsing through the Radware article, it seems a better approach to fix the problem is
to program the device's firewall to deny incoming and outgoing WAN traffic, and the
device would still be usable locally by the innocent customer. If enough customers
return their device to vendors because they do not perform as advertised, that would
get the wheel turning. Bricking a device is kind of 'off-warranty', waste time, and raise
the customers' cost tremendously to prove to the vendors that they did nothing wrong.
The burden should be on the vendors, not the customers.
