SpiderLabs Blog
Attracting more than a half-million annual readers, this is the security community's go-to
destination for technical breakdowns of the latest threats, critical vulnerability disclosures
and cutting-edge research.
On June 25, 2020 Trustwave SpiderLabs published research showing that the
Intelligent Tax software, published by Aisino Corporation and required by a Chinese
bank, actually contained a hidden backdoor that surrendered complete command
and control of the victim’s network. This story received international news coverage
and was widely discussed in security circles. To review the original blog post click
here.
On June 28, 2020, our Threat Fusion team identified a new file being downloaded by the
Aisino Intelligent Tax product. But this time it had nothing to do with remote command and
control of the victim. Rather, this new sample’s sole mission is to delete GoldenSpy and
1/6

remove any trace it existed. Including the deletion of registry entries, all files and folders
(including the GoldenSpy log file), and finally, the uninstaller deletes itself with the following
command: cmd.exe /c del /q C:\Users\admin\AppData\Local\Temp\AWX.exe. Note the “/c”
which will terminate the Windows Command-line interface after the operation is completed
and “/d” which will delete without asking permission or giving any notification.
Gone without a trace, or even knowing it was there.
In our testing, this GoldenSpy uninstaller will automatically download and execute, and
effectively, will negate the direct threat of GoldenSpy in your environment, however, as the
deployment of this uninstaller is delivered directly from the supposedly legitimate tax
software, this has to leave users of Intelligent Tax concerned about what else could be
downloaded and executed in a similar manner.
While the SpiderLabs team is gratified to see GoldenSpy research and analysis result in
such a rapid course reversal in the Golden Tax threat campaign, we are not so optimistic as
to believe that this new development signifies a slow-down in threat actor activity. This
threat is a clear and present danger, driven by incredibly smart and innovative adversaries.
We will allow for the briefest of pats on the back and then return to hunting for the next
threat.
Organizations must continuously be vigilant, always threat hunting, because our
adversaries will continue to find new ways to trick, manipulate, and socially engineer their
way into environments. The value of the GoldenSpy case-study is not the IOCs we
provided, it’s the lesson that malware can be cleverly hidden in any software, regardless of
its source or supposed legitimacy.
Full Analysis of the GoldenSpy Uninstaller below:

GoldenSpy Uninstaller
Description:
Trustwave SpiderLabs investigated the main tax software executable again for the
execution flow because we observed the software execution is derived from the command
given to upgrade or install new software on the infected machines.
Once installed, the main tax module will send a POST request for any software upgrades
that are needed. Initially, it would download the SVMinstaller module to implant the
GoldenSpy malware, but as of June 28, we have identified a new flow that downloads and
executes a customized GoldenSpy uninstaller called “AWX.exe”. Currently, Aisino Intelligent
Tax Software is deploying the GoldenSpy Uninstaller, instead of GoldenSpy itself. This does
raise the question as to what it might deploy next.

2/6

The GoldenSpy Uninstaller, called "AWX.exe" is silently pushed to infected machines from
223.112.21.2:8090 and it cleans up all the traces of GoldenSpy’s existence. The following
flow begins the process:
The command “PROTOCOL_00” will request any software upgrades
Receives command to install “AWX.exe”
The command “PROTOCOL_99” downloads and executes “AWX.exe”

Upon installation, AWX.exe takes the following actions:
1. Identify the executables "svm.exe" and "svmm.exe"
2. Stop the “GoldenSpy” services
3. Kills both “svm.exe” and “svmm.exe” processes.
4. Log the Processes the svm error logs
C:\Program Files (x86)\svm\log\{yearmonthdate}-svm.log
C:\Program Files (x86)\svm\log\{yearmonthdate}-svmm.log
The contents of the log entries are shown below:
[yeardatemonth time] [ERROR][SVM](5056): 1063
[yeardatemonth time] [ERROR][SVMM](3880): 1063
1. Uninstall the autostart services and delete all files and folders containing any
reference to GoldenSpy. To include:
C:\Program Files (x86)\svm\svm.exe
C:\Program Files (x86)\svm\svmm.exe
C:\Program Files (x86)\svm
*Note, this deletion operation also deletes the log file it just generated.

cmd.exe /c del /q C:\Users\admin\AppData\Local\Temp\AWX.exe
Second Sample Identified – BWXT.EXE
In the early morning hours of June 29, a second version of this GoldenSpy Uninstaller was
identified to be downloaded by the Intelligent Tax software, only a few hours after the
original was identified. The new sample was compiled on 29 June 2020 at 10:38PM GMT.
Behaviorally, it was identical to AWX.EXE, however, this version obfuscated its variables
with Base64 encoding. SpiderLabs cannot verify the reason for this change, but we
hypothesize that it may have been to evade antivirus, as several AV engines began to alert
on AWX.EXE.
Strings within the AWX.EXE include:
Project path:
D:\日常工作\客户端软件\VCProject\dgs\Release\BWXT.pdb

Observation:
During our analysis, we found that the GoldenSpy threat actors followed our removal
recommendations step by step with their uninstaller. The table below shows our
recommendations, compared to their installer.
