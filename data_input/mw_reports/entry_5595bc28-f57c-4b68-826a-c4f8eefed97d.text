Physical Appliances: SMA 200, SMA 210, SMA 400, SMA 410
Virtual Appliances: SMA 500v (Azure, AWS, ESXi, HyperV)
All organizations using SMA 100 series products with 10.x or 9.x firmware should apply
the respective patches IMMEDIATELY.
If you already applied the SMA 10.2.0.5-29sv firmware posted on Feb 3., you still need to
upgrade to SMA 10.2.0.6-32sv. If you skipped the SMA 10.2.0.5-29sv firmware update from
Feb. 3, you only need to apply the latest SMA 10.2.0.6-32sv firmware.

Upgrade Steps
All organizations using SMA 10.x or SMA 9.x firmware should immediately implement the
following:

2/11

1. Upgrade to the latest SMA 100 series firmware available from www.mysonicwall.com.
SMA 100 series 10.x customers should upgrade to 10.2.0.6-32sv firmware
SMA 100 series 9.x customers should upgrade to 9.0.0.10-28sv firmware
Both firmware versions are available for everybody, regardless of the status of
their support/service contract.
Instructions on how to update the SMA 100 10.x or 9.x series firmware can be
found in this KB article for physical appliances and this KB article for virtual
devices.
2. After applying the patch, reset passwords for any users who may have logged in to the
device via the web interface. This step only applies if you did not deploy the older
SMA 10.2.0.5-29sv firmware update from Feb. 3.
3. Enable multifactor authentication (MFA) as a safety measure.
MFA has an invaluable safeguard against credential theft and is a key measure of
good security posture.
MFA is effective whether it is enabled on the appliance directly or on the directory
service in your organization.

series devices with 10.x code to enable this mitigation technique.
While this mitigation has been found in our lab to mitigate SNWLID-2021-0001, it does *not*
replace the need to apply the patch in the long term and should only be used as a safety
measure until the patched firmware is installed.
Additional Notes
We currently are not aware of any forensic data that can be viewed by the user to
determine whether a device has been attacked. However, we will post an update as we
get more information.

5/11

SonicWall has confirmed a zero-day vulnerability on SMA 100 series 10.x code. SMA 100
firmware prior to 10.x is unaffected by this zero-day vulnerability.

On Sunday, January 31, 2021, the NCC Group informed the SonicWall Product Security
Incident Response Team (PSIRT) about a potential zero-day vulnerability in the SMA 100
series. Our engineering team confirmed their submission as a critical zero-day in the SMA
100 series 10.x code, and are tracking it as SNWLID-2021-0001.

SonicWall has identified the vulnerable code and is working on a patch to be available by
end of day on February 2, 2021. This vulnerability affects both physical and virtual SMA 100
10.x devices (SMA 200, SMA 210, SMA 400, SMA 410, SMA 500v).
While we work to develop, test and release the patch, customers have the following options:
1. If you must continue operation of the SMA 100 Series appliance until a patch is
available
1. Enable MFA. This is a *CRITICAL* step until the patch is available; AND
2. Reset user passwords for accounts that utilized the SMA 100 series with 10.X
firmware
2. If the SMA 100 series (10.x) is behind a firewall, block all access to the SMA 100 on
the firewall;
3. Shut down the SMA 100 series device (10.x) until a patch is available; or
4. Load firmware version 9.x after a factory default settings reboot. *Please back up your
10.x settings*
1. Important Note: Direct downgrade of Firmware 10.x to 9.x with settings intact is
not supported. You must first reboot the device with factory defaults and then
either load a backed up 9.x configuration or reconfigure the SMA 100 from
scratch.
2. Ensure that you follow multifactor authentication (MFA) best practice security
guidance if you choose to install 9.x.
SonicWall firewalls and SMA 1000 series appliances, as well as all respective
VPN clients, are unaffected and remain safe to use.
SonicWall firewalls and SMA 1000 series appliances, as well as all respective VPN clients,
are unaffected and remain safe to use.

UPDATE: January 29, 2021, 5.30 P.M. CST
As we head into the weekend, we continue to investigate the SMA 100 Series, however the
presence of a potential zero-day vulnerability remains unconfirmed.

6/11

We have also analyzed several reports from our customers of potentially compromised SMA
100 series devices. In these cases, we have so far only observed the use of previously
stolen credentials to log into the SMA devices. The SMA appliance, due to its nature and due
to prevalence of remote work during the pandemic, effectively acts as a “canary” to raising an
alert about inappropriate access. These specific cases came to light through, and were
mitigated by, MFA or End Point Control (EPC). This further emphasizes the importance of
enabling these features, not only on the SMA series, but across the entire enterprise as a
generally recommended security practice. In the age of cloud services and remote work,
credentials can be the key to the kingdom and attackers are keenly aware of this.
We’re also aware of social media posts that shared either supposed proof of concept (PoC)
exploit code utilizing the Shellshock exploit, or screenshots of allegedly compromised
devices. We have confirmed that the Shellshock attack has been mitigated by patches that
we released in 2015. We have also tested the shared PoC code and have so far concluded
that it is not effective against firmware released after the 2015 patch. However, we’ll
continue to closely monitor any new posts and investigate new information. This should also
serve as a reminder to our customer base to always patch and keep current on internet
facing devices.
A reminder to our customers: SonicWall policy has always been to release firmware with
vulnerability patches to everyone, regardless of the support status on the device in question.
Therefore, even if you do not have a valid support contract on your SMA 100 series device,
or any SonicWall device, you can download firmware up to the latest vulnerability fixes on
www.mysonicwall.com. Please take advantage of these updates to ensure that your
equipment is up to the latest firmware.
We will continue to fully investigate this matter and share more information and guidance as
we have it. We will post further updates on this KB and will hopefully soon rule definitively on
the outcome of this investigation.

We’ve also released an updated security best practices guide for the SMA 100 series
devices, including instructions on how to enable MFA:
SMA 100 Series Security Best Practice Guide

UPDATE: January 29, 2021. 7 A.M. CST.
SonicWall security and engineering teams remain focused on the incident and have no
updates to share at this time. We fully understand the urgency of the matter and will continue

SonicWall provides cybersecurity products, services and solutions designed to help keep
organizations safe from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. As the front line of cyber
defense, we have seen a dramatic surge in cyberattacks on governments and businesses,
specifically on firms that provide critical infrastructure and security controls to those
organizations.

10/11

We believe it is extremely important to be transparent with our customers, our partners and
the broader cybersecurity community about the ongoing attacks on global business and
government.
Recently, SonicWall identified a coordinated attack on its internal systems by highly
sophisticated threat actors exploiting probable zero-day vulnerabilities on certain SonicWall
secure remote access products. The impacted products are:
NetExtender VPN client version 10.x (released in 2020) utilized to connect to SMA
100 series appliances and SonicWall firewalls
Secure Mobile Access (SMA) version 10.x running on SMA 200, SMA 210, SMA
400, SMA 410 physical appliances and the SMA 500v virtual appliance
The NetExtender VPN client and SMB-oriented SMA 100 series are used for providing
employees/users with remote access to internal resources. The SMA 1000 series is not
susceptible to this vulnerability and utilizes clients different from NetExtender.
IMPORTANT: Organizations with active SMA 100 Series appliances or with NetExtender
10.x currently have the following options:
For SMA 100 Series

Use a firewall to only allow SSL-VPN connections to the SMA appliance from
known/whitelisted IPs
Or configure whitelist access on the SMA directly itself
