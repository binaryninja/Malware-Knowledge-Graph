IRGC-Associated Cyber Operations Against US
Company Networks
Summary
The FBI is sharing information about a group of Iran-based cyber
actors recently indicted for conducting malicious cyber operations to
obtain access to US-based networks and steal information. The Iranian
nationals indicted are Said Pourkarim Arabi, a member of Iran’s Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Mohammad Reza Espargham, and
Mohammad Bayati, both associates of Arabi. Since at least 2015, the
actors conducted malicious cyber activity against US-based and
foreign organizations and companies involved in aerospace or satellite
technology and international government organizations in the United
States, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Australia, and Israel.
The FBI is providing an overview of the group’s tactics, techniques, and
procedures, as well as indicators of compromise, to aid potential
targets in the identification of malicious activity.

Details
The FBI has observed Iran-based cyber actors conducting multi-phased cyber operations
targeted against companies in the United States. The FBI advises these cyber actors can achieve
substantial unauthorized access to US company networks through harvesting of personally
identifying information, use of fraudulent identities, social engineering, and off-the-shelf
malicious tools. These operations have led to significant financial losses, with the actors
accessing sensitive business information, intellectual property, and vendor information.
The FBI has observed these actors beginning their operations by identifying employees
connected to the US aerospace and satellite industry. The FBI judges the malicious cyber actors
obtained personal details needed to impersonate employees via openly available sources, such
as professional development and networking Web sites. The actors create fraudulent social
media accounts impersonating those individuals. The actors then use information about those
employees for other purposes related to their operations, such as registering email and PayPal
accounts and fraudulently purchasing domains and hacking tools.
The FBI has observed the actors create and send customized spear-phishing emails purporting
to be from the individuals whose identities they had stolen. The emails would entice recipients
to take action – usually clicking on a malicious link, which would download malware being
downloaded onto the victim’s computer and enable unauthorized access to victim networks. In
one instance, the actors were observed hosting malicious code on a file-sharing service
registered in the name of a US company employee, and including links to that malicious code in
spear-phishing emails. One of the actors was observed using a fraudulent domain to host
malware, then sending a link to the malware via spear phishing.
The FBI observed these actors conducting follow-on activities to expand and maintain their
unauthorized access, such as creating additional backdoors and escalating privileges. The actors
were observed using the below tools to exploit victims.

Tool
Metasploit Framework

Mimikatz

NanoCore RAT

OCRA shell-code stagers
Python Backdoor

Description
An open source pen-testing framework
sometimes used by attackers to exploit
vulnerable systems and gain remote access.
Metasploit contains a catalog of prewritten
modules and payloads that make its usage by
attackers very simple.
A post-exploitation tool that dumps
passwords from memory, as well as hashes,
PINS, and Kerberos tickets.
Remote Access Trojan that allows a user to
remotely access and control computers. Also
used to record user credentials and conduct
surveillance using infected computers.
Used to execute intrusions once malicious
code is active on a running system.
Open source backdoor written in the Python
programming language. Additional way to
control a victim’s computer.

The FBI advises that the below indicators of compromise are historical in nature, but may be
used to identify historical targeting efforts.

Recommendations


Ensure anti-virus and anti-malware software is enabled and signature definitions are
updated regularly in a timely manner. Well-maintained anti-virus software may prevent
use of commonly deployed attacker tools that are delivered via spear phishing.



Adopt threat reputation services at the network device, operating system, application,
and email service levels. Reputation services can be used to detect or prevent lowreputation email addresses, files, URLs, and IP addresses used in spear-phishing attacks.



Deploy application control software to limit which applications and executable code can
be run by users. Email attachments, and files downloaded via links in emails, often
contain executable code. Application control software limits users so they can only
execute applications and code allowed by the organization, rendering malicious
executables delivered via spear phishing unable to execute.



Limit the use of administrator privileges. Users who browse the internet, use email, and
execute code with administrator privileges make spear phishing much more effective by
enabling attackers to move laterally across a network, gain additional accesses, and
access highly sensitive information.



Be suspicious of unsolicited contact via email or social media from any individual you do
not know personally.



Be suspicious of unsolicited or unexpected email or social media messages enticing
recipients to open an attached or hosted file.
