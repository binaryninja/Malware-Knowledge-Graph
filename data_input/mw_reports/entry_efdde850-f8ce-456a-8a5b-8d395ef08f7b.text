ESET research uncovers Microsoft Exchange malware remotely controlled via
steganographic PDF and JPG email attachments
1/10

Due to security improvements in operating systems, rootkit usage has been in constant
decline for several years. As such, malware developers – especially those working in
espionage groups – have been busy developing new stealthy userland malware.
Recently, ESET researchers have investigated a sophisticated backdoor used by the
infamous espionage group Turla, also known as Snake. This backdoor, dubbed
LightNeuron, has been specifically targeting Microsoft Exchange mail servers since at least
2014. Although no samples were available for analysis, code artefacts in the Windows
version lead us to believe that a Linux variant exists.

Victimology
During the course of our investigation, we were able to identify at least three different victim
organizations, as shown in Figure 1.

Two of the victims – a ministry of foreign affairs and a regional diplomatic organization – are
in line with recent Turla campaigns we have analyzed.
As we noticed the victim in Brazil thanks to a sample uploaded to the popular multi-scanner
VirusTotal, we were not able to determine the nature of the victim organization.

Attribution to Turla
We believe with high confidence that Turla operates LightNeuron. The following artefacts,
collected during our investigation, back this:
On one compromised Exchange server:
a PowerShell script containing malware previously attributed to Turla was
dropped 44 minutes before a PowerShell script used to install LightNeuron, and
both scripts were located in C:\windows\system32.
The script used to install LightNeuron has a filename – msinp.ps1 – that looks like
typical filenames used by Turla.
On another compromised server, IntelliAdmin – a remote administration tool, packed
with a packer used only by Turla – was dropped by LightNeuron.
For each LightNeuron attack, there were several other instances of Turla malware on
the same network.
The email address used by the attackers was registered at GMX and was
impersonating an employee of the targeted organization. The same provider was used
for the Outlook backdoor and for an undocumented PowerShell backdoor we named
PowerStallion.
Further, in an earlier APT trends report, Kaspersky Labs researchers attributed LightNeuron
with medium confidence to Turla.

Operator activity
While analyzing a compromised asset, we were able to retrace part of the attackers’
activities. In particular, we were able to map the working hours of the operators, using the
time at which the compromised Exchange server received emails containing commands for
the backdoor.
Our first observation is that the activity aligns well with a typical 9-to-5 workday in the
UTC+3 time zone, as shown in Figure 2.

Our second observation is that no activity was observed between December 28, 2018 and
January 14, 2019, while previously and afterwards, the attackers sent several emails per
week. This break in activities corresponds to holidays around the Eastern Orthodox
Christmas.
Even if it is not sufficient for a strong attribution, you can correlate these two observations
with other elements you might have at your disposal.

Main characteristics
LightNeuron is, to our knowledge, the first malware specifically targeting Microsoft
Exchange email servers. It uses a persistence technique never before seen: a Transport
Agent. In the mail server architecture, it operates at the same level of trust as security
products such as spam filters. Figure 3 summarizes how LightNeuron operates.

Figure 3 – LightNeuron Transport Agent

By leveraging the Transport Agent accesses, LightNeuron is able to:
Read and modify any email going through the mail server.
Compose and send new emails.
Block any email. The original recipient will not receive the email.
A flexible set of XML rules drives these functions, as shown in Figure 4.

At the end of the rules, there is the list of the handlers implemented by LightNeuron. These
functions are used in the rules to process the emails. Table 1 describes the eleven different
handlers.

log

replace

Backdoor
The command handler is different from the others that perform modifications on the emails.
It is actually a backdoor controlled by emails. The commands are hidden in PDF or JPG
attachments using steganography.
The attackers just have to send an email containing a specially crafted PDF document or
JPG image to any email address of the compromised organization. It allows full control over
the Exchange server by using the commands shown in Table 2.

Table 2 – List of instruction codes
Once an email is recognized as a command email, the command is executed and the email
is blocked directly on the Exchange server. Thus, it is very stealthy and the original recipient
will not be able to view it.

Steganography
LightNeuron uses steganography to hide its commands inside a PDF document or a JPG
image. Thus, even if the email is intercepted, it might look legitimate, as it contains a valid
attachment.
In the case of a PDF, the command data can be anywhere in the document. LightNeuron
operators just add a header at the beginning of the PDF to specify the offset at which the
data is located, as shown in Figure 5.

Once this blob of data has been decrypted with AES-256, it reveals a custom structure
shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6 – Hexadecimal dump of a decrypted command container

The most interesting fields are:
Offset 0x08, the email address to which the result of the command is sent.
Offset 0x1D, the instruction code. It corresponds to one of the function described
above.
Offset 0x25, the first argument. It will be passed to the function represented by the
instruction code.
If an email containing such a command container, embedded in a JPG or in a PDF, is sent
to a server compromised by LightNeuron, a calculator will be executed on the Microsoft
Exchange server.

Cleaning
The cleaning of LightNeuron is not an easy task. Simply removing the two malicious
files will break Microsoft Exchange, preventing everybody in the organization from
sending and receiving emails. Before actually removing the files, the malicious Transport
Agent should be disabled. We encourage you to read the full white paper before
implementing a cleaning mechanism.

In conclusion
Over the past years, we have published numerous blogposts and white papers detailing the
activities of the Turla group, including man-in-the-middle attacks against adobe.com or
sophisticated userland malware. However, for now it seems that LightNeuron has taken up
the mantle of the most advanced known malware in Turla’s arsenal.
By leveraging a previously unseen persistence mechanism, a Microsoft Exchange
Transport Agent, LightNeuron allows its operators to stay under the radar for months or
years. It allows them to exfiltrate sensitive documents and control other local machines via
a C&C mechanism that is very hard to detect and block.
We will continue to track Turla activities closely to help defenders protect their networks.
A full and comprehensive list of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and samples can be found
in the full white paper and on GitHub.

For a detailed analysis of the backdoor, refer to our white paper Turla LightNeuron: One
email away from remote code execution. For any inquiries, or to make sample submissions
