INTRODUCTION

W

hile many of the headlinegrabbing cyber security breaches
of 2014 involved major U.S.
companies, Southeast Asia quietly dealt
with its share of cyber attacks. Like the U.S.,
companies in this region face a complex
threat landscape filled with advanced cyber
attackers intent on stealing corporate data
and state secrets.

THE MISSION IS TWO-FOLD:

Advanced persistent threat (APT) actors
are one of the biggest challenges for the
region. Leading companies that do business
in the energy, telecommunications, hightech, finance, and transportation sectors are
targets of APT groups.

This report describes malware detected at
commercial and government entities across
Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam,
Philippines, Indonesia, and Brunei. It also discusses
advanced threat groups behind many of these
attacks and their unique motives in this region.

Steal intellectual
property and inside
information from
leading companies.

Obtain intelligence on rival
governments during longrunning political disputes,
especially those involving the
disputed South China Sea.

Southeast Asian companies regularly
attract the interest of cyber spies and
criminals looking to steal information
about the region’s growing industry
sectors—energy, telecommunications,
high-tech, transportation, and finance.

Territorial disputes in the South China
Sea drive cyber espionage activity in
Southeast Asia. Both government and
private industries are targets of threat
actors seeking to steal information in
these disputes.

In addition to the targeted and APT malware,
organizations in the region frequently detect other
threats, including banking Trojans, botnets, and
other types of cyber crime.
Regionally, our customers most frequently detect
Zeus (a banking Trojan) and Sality (a multi-featured
Trojan) on their networks.
These commodity malware families are widely
known, but dismissing the threat they pose is
a mistake.
For one, they continue to evade detection by
traditional security tools, making them highly
effective. And advanced threat groups often
use these common malware families to gain a
foothold into corporate environments.

SOUTHEAST ASIA’S
LEADING INDUSTRY
SECTORS ATTRACT
APT ACTORS

W

e observe APT groups routinely
targeting companies in Southeast Asia
to steal intellectual property (IP). We
believe that once stolen, this IP often makes its
way to Chinese companies. These companies can
use the stolen IP to bypass years of research and
development costs and get an inside edge when
they deal with competitors in the region.

Southeast Asia’s financial sector faces a dual
threat. First, standard cybercriminals are looking
to steal money from them. Second, advanced
threat actors are seeking sensitive financial
information for a business advantage.

As increasing investments and diversifying
economies spur development in the region, this
growth simultaneously becomes even more
attractive to APT groups.

These industry sectors appear to be most heavily targeted by APT groups:

ENERGY

TELECOMMUNICATIONS

HIGH-TECH

TRANSPORTATION

FINANCIAL SERVICES

Recent Cases

Most Likely Corporate
Targets

Energy

APT groups have long
targeted U.S. and multinational
corporations with strong
offerings in green technology
and other clean energy
production. R&D breakthroughs
in this sector would provide
tremendous value to China’s
energy sector, especially in
light of continued international
pressure to lower emissions.

FireEye has observed multiple
instances of APT groups
breaching the networks of
regional energy companies.
In one case, we discovered
three different threat groups
attempting to gain access to
the network of an oil company
that conducts offshore oil
exploration.

• Green Energy Technology
Researchers and Providers

Southeast Asia is an important
potential source of hydrocarbon
reserves. The disputed territories
in the South China Sea are
estimated to contain a considerable
amount of natural gas and
petroleum. As rapid economic
growth creates a surge in energy
demand, energy resources in the
disputed maritime territories have
become increasingly valuable.
All of these factors are likely to
provoke further APT activity.

• Utilities
• Oil and Gas Producers
• Critical Infrastructure
Providers and Operators

The threat groups appeared
to target affiliates of the
company, as well as its
infrastructure development
divisions. We believe these
threat groups chiefly sought
data of competitive value. But
they were also on the lookout
for any information about the
company’s exploration plans
and movements in the area.
We have also observed targeted
threat actors deploying malware
against the networks of a major
electric grid operator in the region.

Recent Cases

Most Likely Corporate
Targets

Telecommunications

We have observed one
APT group, which we call
APT5, particularly focused
on telecommunications and
technology companies. More
than half of the organizations
we have observed being
targeted or breached by APT5
operate in these sectors. Several
times, APT5 has targeted
organizations and personnel
based in Southeast Asia.

APT5 targeted the network of
an electronics firm that sells
products for both industrial
and military applications. The
group subsequently stole
communications related to the
firm’s business relationship with
a national military, including
inventories and memoranda
about specific products they
provided.

• Regional
Telecommunication
Providers

High-Tech

APT5 has been active since
at least 2007. It appears to
be a large threat group that
consists of several subgroups,
often with distinct tactics
and infrastructure. APT5
has targeted or breached
organizations across multiple
industries, but its focus appears
to be on telecommunications
and technology companies,
especially information about
satellite communications.

• Asia-Based Employees of
Global Telecommunications
and Tech Firms
• High-Tech Manufacturing
• Military Application
Technology

In one case in late 2014,
APT5 breached the
network of an international
telecommunications company.
The group used malware with
keylogging capabilities to
monitor the computer of an
executive who manages the
company’s relationships with
other telecommunications
companies. This method
allowed APT5 to collect data on
topics such as:
• Pricing discussions, bidding
strategies and competitor
pricing information
• Schedules for contract
bidding and product
deployment
• Opportunities in Asian
telecommunications market
• Business opportunities with
other telecommunications
companies
APT5 also targeted the
networks of some of
Southeast Asia’s major
telecommunications providers
with Leouncia malware. We
suspect that the group sought
access to these networks
to obtain information that
would enable it to monitor
communications passing
through the providers’ systems.

Recent Cases

Most Likely Corporate
Targets

Transportation

APT groups likely target
the region’s transportation
companies to monitor the
progress of high-profile projects
that have the potential to fuel
continued economic growth in
the region.

In one case, a threat group
that has historically focused
its operations on targets in
the Philippines and Malaysia
spoofed the domain names of
two well-known international
shipping companies. One of the
spoofed companies was a major
commercial freight company
that transports commodities
around the globe. The other
was a regional shipbuilding
company. The plausible URLs
were designed to entice
potential victims within
targeted industries to click.

• Shipping Companies
• Port Operators
• Airlines
• Public Transit Systems

Another APT group targeted
a major operator of container
ship terminals in Southeast Asia.
We suspect the group targeted
the port operator to monitor
its communications with
regional security and military
organizations that partner with
the company.
A threat group targeted a rail
operator. We detected variants
of the Lecna/BackSpace APT
malware in the transit company’s
networks in early 2014.

Recent Cases

Financial Services

Banks in Southeast Asia appear
to face a double threat. The first
is the pernicious cybercrime
activity we observe around
the world, such as credit card
fraud and the theft of banking
credentials. The second threat
is focused specifically on banks
with a development mission in
the region.

In one case, a threat group
• Banks
targeted a development bank
• Companies Funding Major

strategic projects and industries
Projects
in the region.
In another instance, we saw two
different threat groups infect
the networks of a central bank.
Stolen data on the country’s
monetary policies and banking
system could be highly valuable
information to someone looking
to understand and anticipate
broader banking and funding
trends in the country and region.

Most Likely Corporate
Targets

• Institutions Dealing With

Banks that invest in the region’s strategic
growth face more threats than traditional
credit card fraud and financial hackers.

T

he APT groups that we track actively target
governments and militaries for inside
information into negotiations and political
issues. APT groups that target governments in the
region are frequently interested in topics related
to the South China Sea. And they are increasingly
active during times of heightened political tension
or transition.

APT Groups and the South China
Sea: Territorial Disputes with a
Digital Edge
FireEye routinely observes APT groups steal
information dealing with South China Sea disputes
and their economic effects from the networks of
governments and companies involved. Control
over territory in the South China Sea is a fiercely
contested issue between China, the Philippines,
Brunei, Vietnam, Taiwan, and Malaysia.

The territorial disputes have huge consequences
for each claimant's national and economic security.
The stakes are high: more than half of the world's
commercial shipping passes through the South
China Sea. It contains potential reserves of up to
11 billion barrels of oil, 190 trillion cubic feet of
natural gas, and prime fishing areas.
Territorial disputes have lingered for decades.
Along with militaries and coast guards of claimant
countries, South China Sea disputes involve
regional oil firms, cargo companies, and fisheries.
The territory has been at the center of many
international incidents, reflecting the considerable
national and economic security implications for
the rival claimants.

frequently targeted with malware that
steals sensitive security details.

Threat Groups Target Southeast
Asian Governments and Militaries
over Territorial Claims
Southeast Asian government and military entities
have been targeted several times in what we
suspect are efforts to obtain intelligence related
to territorial disputes.
• An APT group stole data from one country’s
government and military networks on several
occasions, including a period of heightened
tension over competing claims in the South
China Sea.1
Some of the files that the APT group took
included the following:
–– General military documents
–– Internal communications
–– Equipment maintenance reports and
specifications
–– Event-related materials
–– Documentation of organizational
programs and initiatives
• Other threat groups have targeted a country’s
air force with spear-phishing emails that
referenced the country’s military and regional
maritime disputes. These emails were designed
to appear to originate from email accounts
associated with other elements of the military.

• Other threat actors have used the Grillmark
backdoor to attempt to gain access to the
networks of two countries’ government and
military entities. These threat actors targeted
their victims through spear-phishing emails
that contained weaponized documents relating
to either diplomatic or military affairs.

APT Groups Gather
Political Intelligence
In August 2014, an APT group appeared to
target intelligence related to a Southeast Asia
government. The threat actors sent a spearphishing email that referenced the country’s
leadership and contained a document with
sections extracted from related news articles.
The email appeared to originate from a
compromised intelligence agency email account,
although the threat actors may have faked the
email address. Many of the email’s recipients
were associated with the targeted country’s
government and military or were involved in intelsharing partnerships. In either case, the recipient
would likely have access to information regarding
the country’s security and internal stability.

CONCLUSION

P

ublic and private organizations in the
Southeast Asian region are prime targets for
advanced threat groups. The data is clear:
targeted threat actors are focused on getting into
the networks of and stealing from fast-growing
industries, as well as from organizations involved
in territorial claims over the South China Sea.

The outcome of the dispute has major geopolitical
and economic implications for multiple countries.
The area is key to regional trade because of its
rich energy reserves, prime fishing waters, and
significance to commercial shipping routes. These
issues and the region’s mounting importance will
likely propel state-sponsored threat groups to
continue targeting Southeast Asian governments
and companies for the near future.

State-sponsored threat groups will
continue to target Southeast Asian
governments and companies.
