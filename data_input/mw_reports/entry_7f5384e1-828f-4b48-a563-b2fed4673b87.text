‘Purple Fox’ Malware Can Rootkit and Abuse PowerShell

September 9, 2019

Exploit kits may no longer be as prolific as it was back when their activities were detected in
the millions, but their recurring activities in the first half of 2019 indicate that they won’t be
going away any time soon. The Rig exploit kit, for instance, is known for delivering various
payloads — such as downloader trojans, ransomware, cryptocurrency-mining malware, and
information stealers — whose arrival and delivery techniques are also constantly fine-tuned.
The Purple Fox fileless downloader malware, which was reported to have at least affected
30,000 users last year, is a recent example. Also delivered by the Rig exploit kit, Purple Fox
previously used the Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) tool to retrieve and execute its
payload. We’ve also previously seen Purple Fox downloading and executing cryptocurrencymining malware.
This new iteration of Purple Fox that we came across, also being delivered by Rig, has a few
new tricks up its sleeve. It retains its rootkit component by abusing publicly available code. It
now also eschews its use of NSIS in favor of abusing PowerShell, making Purple Fox
capable of fileless infection. It also incorporated additional exploits to its infection chain, most
likely as a foolproof mechanism to ensure that it can still infect the system. Purple Fox is a
downloader malware; besides retrieving and executing cryptocurrency-mining threats, it can
also deliver other kinds of malware.

Purple Fox’s Infection Chain
Here’s an overview of the infection chain of this new version of Purple Fox:
Once the user accesses a malicious site hosting one of Rig’s landing pages, there are
three methods used to ultimately redirect the user to a malicious PowerShell script that
will, in turn, either directly execute Purple Fox’s main component or escalate privileges
in order to download and execute a file that would lead to Purple Fox:
Through a Flash (.swf) file that exploits CVE-2018-15982, which would lead to a
malicious PowerShell script
Two .htm files that exploit CVE-2014-6332, a vulnerability in Internet Explorer’s
VBScript engine; and CVE-2018-8174, a remote code execution (RCE)
vulnerability in VBScript engine affecting various Windows versions (note that
these vulnerabilities have long been patched). The .htm file containing an exploit
for CVE-2018-8174 redirects to an HTML application (.hta) file.
The .hta file, which redirects to a malicious PowerShell script
If the current user account in the affected system has administrative access, the
malicious PowerShell script, posing as an image (.jpg) file, will abuse the application
programming interface (API) of msi.dll — a dynamic-link library (DLL) that contains
functions for installing Microsoft Installer (.msi) packages — in order to execute and
install Purple Fox’s main component, which also poses as a randomly named image
file.
If the current user account does not have administration access, the PowerShell
script would instead abuse a PowerSploit module (normally used by penetration
testers) that will, in turn, exploit two vulnerabilities: CVE-2015-1701 and CVE2018-8120. Both of these are privilege escalation flaws in Win32k, a multiuser
driver in Windows.
Once the script successfully exploits CVE-2015-1701 and CVE-2018-8120, it will
gain elevated privileges, used to abuse msiexec.exe (an executable that enables
the installation or modification of .msi files via command line) to download and
execute Purple Fox’s main component.

Purple Fox’s Payload Delivery and Rootkit Component

2/4

The malware uses msi.dll’s MsiInstallProductA function to download and execute its payload
— an .msi file that contains an encrypted shellcode as well as 32-bit and 64-bit versions of
the payload. Once executed, the malware restarts the system and uses the
PendingFileRenameOperations registry (responsible for storing names of files that the OS
will rename when it restarts) to rename its components.
It would then use its rootkit capability (hiding its files and registry entries) after the system is
restarted. It creates a suspended svchost process and injects a DLL that will then create a
driver with the rootkit capability. Before proceeding further to the payload, it sets up the
following in the injected DLL: a driver file (dump_{random hex}.sys), which is responsible for
the rootkit capability; and its main component in the form of a DLL file (Ms{random
hex}App.dll).
Unlike the previous version of Purple Fox, however, this new iteration abuses an opensource code to enable its rootkit components, which includes hiding and protecting its files
and registry entries. Also of note is the way this new version of Purple Fox abuses a file
utility software to hide its DLL component, which deters reverse engineering or cracking
attempts.

Best practices and Trend Micro solutions
Purple Fox exemplifies what we’re seeing in this year’s threat landscape: a multilayered
approach to how it “lives off the land.” Purple Fox’s emphasis on leaving a small footprint is
also notable, with its abuse of legitimate tools and use of fileless techniques (e.g., DLL
injection). Purple Fox also uses exploits for vulnerabilities with available patches. Its attack
chain, for instance, exploits a vulnerability that was disclosed and patched five years ago.
This highlights the significance of patching, especially for enterprises. And given how Purple
Fox can deliver virtually any kind of threat, a defense-in-depth approach to securing online
infrastructures is important. Here are some best practices that users and organizations can
adopt:
Enforce the principle of least privilege by restricting and securing the use of tools
reserved for system administrators.
Regularly patch and update (or employ virtual patching for legacy or embedded
systems or software).
Deploy additional mechanisms that provide additional layers of security, such as
behavior monitoring, which thwarts malware-related routines from being executed in
the system; sandboxes, which can quarantine malicious files and further analyze
suspicious behaviors; and firewalls and intrusion prevention and detection systems that
can deter incursions or flag data exfiltration attempts.

Cultivate cybersecurity awareness at home and in the workplace, especially against
email-borne threats that fileless threats could use as attack vectors or entry points.
Trend Micro endpoint solutions such as the Smart Protection Suites and Worry-Free
Business Security solutions, which have behavior monitoring capabilities, can protect users
and businesses from these types of threats by detecting malicious files, scripts, and
messages as well as blocking all related malicious URLs. Trend Micro Apex One™
protection employs a variety of threat detection capabilities, notably behavioral analysis,
which protect against malicious scripts, injection, ransomware, memory and browser attacks
related to fileless threats.
The Trend Micro™ Deep Discovery Inspector solution protects customers from Rig exploit kit
and Purple Fox via these DDI rules:
3286: RIG - Exploit Kit - HTTP (Request)
4220: RIG - Exploit Kit - HTTP (Request)
