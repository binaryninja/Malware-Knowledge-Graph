Executive Summary
For the past 16 months, eSentire’s security research team, the Threat Response Unit (TRU),
has been tracking one of the most capable and stealthy malware suites — Golden Chickens.
Golden Chickens is the “cyber weapon of choice” for three of the top money making, longestrunning Internet crime groups: Russia-based FIN6 and Cobalt Group and Belarus-based
Evilnum. The three criminal operations are estimated to have collectively caused financial
losses over USD $1.5 billion. This report unveils the identity of the threat actor behind
Golden Chickens—who goes by badbullzvenom—and outlines how he was found.

Key Findings
Who is badbullzvenom? Reading through the history of the threat actor’s posts on the
Russian-language hacker forum, Exploit.in, TRU found multiple mentions of the
badbullzvenom account being shared between two people. From the posts, we learn the
following about badbullzvenom:
They claim to be from Moldova
They speak Romanian, French, and English
They claim to work with Russia-based Cobalt Gang (this is also evident in public
analysis of Golden Chickens campaign IOCs)

Who is “Frapstar” and what is his connection to badbullzvenom?
1/26

Numerous other data points in the report connect a second threat actor, who goes by
“Frapstar” and the username badbullzvenom. He self-identifies as “Chuck from Montreal” –
an alias. In addition to speaking French and having a keen interest in buying stolen
Canadian credit card accounts, he says he owns a BMW 5 Series automobile, which
provides TRU with further leads into the identity of “Chuck”.

Conclusion
TRU has discovered “Chuck’s” real name, pictures of him, his home address, the names of
his parents, siblings, and friends; his social media accounts, his hobbies, and that he owns a
small business, which he runs out of his home.
“Chuck”, who uses multiple aliases for his underground forum, social media, and Jabber
accounts, and the threat actor claiming to be from Moldova, have gone to great lengths to
disguise themselves. They have also taken great pains to obfuscate the Golden Chickens
malware, trying to make it undetectable by most AV companies, and limiting customers to
using Golden Chickens for ONLY targeted attacks. Because of eSentire’s investigation,
“Chuck” has lost his anonymity. TRU also continues to track improvements in the Golden
Chickens source code and discover new Golden Chickens attack campaigns, as recent as
July, which tells us at least one threat actor is still actively developing the product and selling
it to other cybercriminals. We expect to see further targeted attacks, leveraging this malware,
being launched against financial institutions and other organizations in the foreseeable
future.

Introduction
eSentire is a leading global provider of Managed Detection and Response security services.
For the past 16 months, our security research team, the Threat Response Unit (TRU), has
been tracking, analyzing, and defending our customers from one of the most capable and
stealthy malware suites on the Cyber Underground – Golden Chickens. Golden Chickens is
the “cyber weapon of choice” for three of the top money making and longest-running Internet
crime groups: Russia-based FIN6 and Cobalt Group and Belarus-based Evilnum. The three
cybercrime operations are estimated to have collectively caused financial losses over USD
$1.5 billion.
Since 2018, the Golden Chickens suite has been distributed as a Malware-as-a-Service
(MaaS). Between April 2021 and April 2022, TRU discovered two significant hacking
campaigns utilizing Golden Chickens. During the April 2021 incidents, TRU found corporate
employees on LinkedIn being targeted by threat actors using fake job offers. One year later
the April 2022 campaign uncovered by TRU demonstrated that the attack tactics were
reversed, and corporate hiring managers were sent fake resumes, of job applicants, laden
with malware.

2/26

TRU continues to track the Golden Chickens malware, and not only have we detected a new
threat campaign that appears to be targeting e-Commerce organizations, we have also
discovered the identity of the threat actor/operator behind Golden Chickens. He is referred to
by CrowdStrike researchers as VENOM SPIDER, and he has been connected to the threat
actor “badbullzvenom”.
TRU has tracked many of badbullzvenom‘s Internet activities, going back as far as 2013. We
have also discovered badbullzvenom‘s birthdate, home address, his parents and siblings‘
names, friends‘ names, his hobbies, his social media accounts, and one of his side
businesses.
It is rare to uncover this level of detail about a threat operator, and it illustrates the breadth
and expertise of TRU. This intelligence, including many of the Underground Forum
conversations badbullzvenom has had with other threat actors, has been extremely valuable.
It has helped us better decipher his Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs), as well as
the origins of the Golden Chickens MaaS and its ongoing operations. With this knowledge,
we continue to hone our defenses, protecting eSentire’s global customer base from wellorchestrated attacks utilizing the Golden Chickens MaaS.
It is our objective with this report to share our research with other organizations and their
security teams so that they might better defend their critical data and applications from threat
actors mounting attack campaigns using the Golden Chickens malware suite. The balance of
this report includes:
A brief overview of the FIN6, Cobalt Group and Evilnum cybercrime organizations
A detailed account of the investigation and subsequent identification of the Golden
Chickens MaaS operator
An analysis of the Golden Chickens malware and the current attack campaign
Insights and security recommendations from TRU

Golden Chickens‘ Connection to the Billion Dollar Hackers’ Club—FIN6,
Cobalt Group and Evilnum
For those not familiar with FIN6, Cobalt Group and Evilnum, they are hands down three of
the longest-running and successful financial crime gangs, and it is reported that cumulatively
they have caused over USD $1.5 billion in losses.
FIN6
This Russia-based, financial cybercrime group is known as one of the most notorious
hacking gangs in the world of cybercrime. They dominated news headlines in 2018 when
they were cited as being the cyber gang who broke into the online payment systems of
British Airways, Ticketmaster UK and top electronic retailer, Newegg, stealing credit and
debit card data from millions of customers, as well as stealing Personal Identifiable
3/26

Information (PII) from British Airways’ customers and staff. British Airways concluded that
during their cyber heist, the hackers siphoned off credit and debit card data (also referred to
as card-skimming),and personal data from 425,000 of their customers and staff. As a result,
British Airways was slapped with a £20 million (USD $26 million) fine from the Information
Commissioner’s Office (ICO), a UK government watchdog group. The ICO determined that
British Airways did not take the right precautions in protecting the sensitive data of its
customers. However, the ICO fine was not the end of the damage caused by the FIN6
breach of British Airways. On July 5, 2021, British Airways settled a legal claim made by a
group of the airline’s customers and staff, whose data had been leaked during the breach.
The settlement was kept confidential, and the airline agreed to pay compensation for
qualifying claimants but did not admit liability, according to news sources.
The number of customers affected by the Ticketmaster UK breach, at the hands of FIN6,
numbered in the millions. In fact, security experts estimate that the 2018 attack impacted 9.4
million customers. The UK ICO determined that the breach led directly to widespread fraud.
As such, they levied a fine of £1.25 million on the ticket agency stating that the corporation
“failed to put appropriate security measures in place to prevent a cyber-attack on a chat-bot
installed on its online payment page” – and this violated the E.U.’s General Data Protection
Regulations (GDPR).
And while top online electronics retailer Newegg couldn’t specify just how many of their
customers’ credit and debit cards were stolen, security reports found that the threat actors
were inside Newegg’s IT network for a month before being detected, giving the
cyberattackers a full 30 days to skim many of Newegg’s customers. Newegg is estimated to
receive over 50 million visitors a month, according to Similarweb, a firm which collects
information on site visits.
Conservatively, security firm FireEye estimates that between 2016 and 2019, FIN6 is
believed to have stolen 20 million payment cards worth $400 million. The FIN6 gang first
gained notoriety in 2014 for their attacks against point-of-sale (POS) machines in retail
outlets and hospitality companies , but as proven by their attacks against British Airways,
Ticketmaster UK and Newegg in 2018, they wholeheartedly moved on to target online
payment systems of large e-Commerce companies.
FIN6 attacks e-Commerce companies’ payment platforms with Golden Chickens in late
2018 & retail, entertainment and pharma companies’ payment portals attacked by
Golden Chickens in early 2019.
Interestingly, intelligence analysts with Visa reported that at the end of 2018, FIN6 was
specifically targeting numerous e-Commerce companies’ payment servers and using
malicious documents to infect their targets with the more_eggs component of the Golden
Chickens malware, as the initial phase of their attack.

4/26

That activity mirrors another threat campaign that was reported separately in February 2019
by ProofPoint researchers. In these incidents, threat actors were observed attacking retail,
entertainment and pharmaceutical companies’ online payments systems and using
malicious documents, laden with the more_eggs component of Golden Chickens, to target
the companies’ employees. The threat actors sent fake job offers to the employees, cleverly
using the job title listed on their LinkedIn profiles in their communications. Could FIN6 be
behind this Golden Chickens attack campaign?
Later in August 2019, the FIN6 operators launched another malicious campaign, and
researchers believe FIN6 was actively going after multinational organizations. Like the
February 2019 campaign, employees were spear phished with fake job offers. According to
researchers, the threat actors began by targeting handpicked employees using LinkedIn
messaging and email.
Between the end of 2018 and April 2021, there have been three distinct Golden
Chickens/more_eggs LinkedIn campaigns using the same modus operandi (MO). Each
campaign targeted corporate employees, utilized their LinkedIn profile, and then social
engineered them with bogus job offers, which lead to the more_eggs component of Golden
Chickens.
Cobalt Group
Another Russia-based organized cybercrime gang that has been plaguing financial
institutions since at least 2016 and is known to use the Golden Chickens malware suite. The
Cobalt Group is reported to have caused the financial industry over a billion dollars in
cumulative losses. Their crime spree includes the targeting of 100 financial institutions in
more than 40 countries worldwide, allowing the criminals to steal more than USD $11 million
per heist.
The Cobalt Group's typical MO was to infiltrate banking institutions by sending spear
phishing emails with malicious attachments to bank employees. The Cobalt Group
repeatedly used Golden Chickens and its more_eggs backdoor in their attacks. Once
downloaded, the cybercriminals gained access to the infected computer and were able to
access the internal banking network. The Cobalt Group was said to have spent months
inside the infected networks studying the bank’s operations and workflows, including the
Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) bank system.
The Cobalt Group also gained notoriety for its “jackpotting“ schemes where they would break
into bank servers that controlled the ATMs and manipulate the ATMs to remotely dispense
cash at a certain time, in predetermined locations, where money mules waited to collect the
cash.
Evilnum

5/26

The Evilnum group, believed to be out of Belarus, is best known for compromising financial
technology companies and companies that provide stock trading platforms and tools. They
target financial information about the FINTECH companies and their customers, seeking out
spreadsheets, customer lists, investments, trading operations and credentials for trading
software platforms. The Evilnum group is also known to spear phish employees of the
companies they are targeting and enclose malicious zip files. If executed, the employees
often get hit with the more_eggs backdoor, along with other malware.

Unmasking badbullzvenom—The Threat Actor Behind Golden Chickens
Quo Intelligence first connected VENOM SPIDER to the threat actor “badbullzvenom”. This
attribution was made possible due to a dispute on the Exploit.in hacker forum. In the thread,
private conversations are revealed between a Golden Chickens MaaS customer,
BlackAngus, and the MaaS provider, badbullzvenom. The dispute centered around a sample
of the malware appearing in VirusTotal, causing the customer to be banned from the service.
Because the actual sample in VirusTotal was linked in the thread, researchers were able to
confirm the connection to the Golden Chickens MaaS and identify badbullzvenom as the
MaaS operator.

Figure 1 - Exploit.in reply to dispute thread. badbullzvenom drops BlackAngus as a customer
for breaking his rules and shuts down his access.

6/26

From the entire content of his posts on Exploit.in, we learn the following information about
badbullzvenom:
They claim to be from Moldova
They speak Romanian, French, and English
They claim to work with Cobalt Gang (this is also evident in public analysis of Golden
Chickens campaign IOCs)

The Connection between badbullzvenom and “Frapstar”
Digging deeper into Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), TRU studied numerous security
reports in order to connect the various forum accounts engaged with the Golden Chickens
MaaS, and we found one published by Trend Micro in 2015 titled: Attack of the Solo
Cybercriminals – Frapstar in Canada, where the threat actor is identified as a lone carder (a
criminal who monetizes stolen credit cards) with accounts and multiple aliases (including
badbullzvenom) on several hacker forums.

7/26

Figure 2 - Trend Micro Report on Frapstar

From this report, we learn more key information about the threat actor who goes by Frapstar:
They have a keen interest in obtaining stolen Canadian credit card accounts
They own a BMW 5 Series automobile, specifically the E39 540i
They use the following usernames on various forums:
Badbullzvenom
Badbullz
Frapstar
Ksensei21
E39_Frap* (i.e., E39_Frapstar)

Are There Two Threat Actors Behind the Golden Chickens MaaS?

8/26

In the report from Trend, we see that user E39_Frap* self-identifies as “Chuck from
Montreal”. However, this seems to be at odds with the information from the Exploit.in forum
where the threat actor says he is from Moldova and can write in Romanian, as well as in
English and French. He even participates in a thread on the Lampeduza forum titled
“Romanian only”. However, in the earlier thread, we also see where badbullzvenom says he
can write in French, which could show a possible connection to Montreal.
Is the threat actor behind the badbullzvenom account from Montreal, Moldova or another
Eastern European country where Romanian is spoken? This remained a mystery until we
had the opportunity to read through many of the threat actor’s older forum posts. Here we
found mentions on multiple occasions of the badbullzvenom account being shared between
two people. (See Figures 3 and 4).

Figure 3 - Exploit.in post

Figure 4 - Exploit.in post

9/26

TRU believes that “Chuck” is just one threat actor that operates the badbullzvenom account
at times, and is in fact located in Montreal, Canada. We also believe there is a second threat
actor, possibly from Moldova or Romania, that operates the badbullzvenom account
alongside “Chuck.”

Timeline of badbullzvenom’s Progression from Script Kiddie to MaaS
Provider
Badbullzvenom’s activity on Exploit.in, over the years, demonstrates a progression from a
“script kiddie” to a MaaS provider:

Figure 5: Progression from ScriptKiddie to MaaS Provider

2013 – badbullzvenom first recorded posts on the forum that are often complaints about
other users. He demonstrates an interest in Canadian computer traffic and Canadian banks
such as TD, CIBC, Scotiabank, and BMO.
2014 – Throughout the majority of 2014, badbullzvenom only posts three times in Exploit.in.
2015 – badbullzvenom returns from his hiatus, but he tends to demonstrate more confidence
and technical acumen. He points other members to appropriate tools of the hacking trade,
participates in banter, shows an interest in banking trojans for sale, and starts giving more
positive reviews.
2016 – After another hiatus, badbullzvenom returns once again, offering for sale his first
cyber tool. He only nets two customers and in this time, he continues to show interest in
banking trojans and cryptors, as well as a continued interest in financial data relating to
Canada. He also makes aggressive and offensive comments, including one statement he
makes before going on hiatus again, where he tells one member of Exploit.in to kill
themselves, and he offers to pay for the bullet.
2017-2019 – badbullzvenom returns to the forum once more, offering the sale of “Word 1-day
doc builder” – known today as VenomKit. It is a malicious document builder that takes
advantage of Windows Office exploits. He accumulates customers quickly and continues to
10/26

develop the builder, adding new exploits as they appear and updating its features. For
example, PowerShell is removed from the attack chain to reduce detection, .dll support is
added for payloads, and a .js downloader (likely the more_eggs backdoor component of
Golden Chickens is added and is for sale.) During this timeframe, Cobalt Group is reported
as using badbullzvenom’s builder to deploy Cobalt Strike in attacks on banks – then again in
2018. In 2019, FIN6 is observed using more_eggs with employment lures.

Picking Up the Trail
In recent years, database leaks have exposed billions of users’ credentials, leading to
hacking and privacy concerns. However, one aspect of this activity works in favor of network
defenders – the fact that numerous hacking forums have had their user databases leaked,
offering an opportunity to make connections between online personas of known threat actors
and their real-world identities.
Referencing the 2015 Trend Micro report, we confirmed the threat actor had accounts in
three underground forums. These forums were later breached, and the user databases
leaked, revealing email addresses used by the threat actor in the past:
Carder.pro
frapstar:[email protected]
Opensc.ws
ksensei:[email protected]
Carder.su
frapstar:[email protected]
Other database leaks revealed an account using the [email protected] email address with the
password “Nay45uck+”. Pivoting on this piece of information leads us to an old Myspace
account registered to [email protected] that used the same password. While it is possible
there could be two users that coincidentally chose the same rather unique password,
searching Google leads us to the account “crazyteg67” on the Montreal Racing forum using
that email address, to sell $1000 worth of gift cards for $700.

11/26

Figure 6 - Montreal Racing post

This account seems to be shared by multiple people, as there are frequent posts offering
items for sale with different contact phone numbers and first names in the offer. One of the
contact names is “Chuck”.

Figure 7 - crazyteg67 selling an XBOX 360 as "chuck"

The crazyteg67 user also owns a BMW 540i according to his own posts:
12/26

Figure 8 - crazyteg67 looking for a 540i clutch replacement

The Social Media Trail
Pivoting on the “dalion67” username, we find a Pinterest account for “Dee Inconegro”, with a
few boards created under it. One of those boards is dedicated to BMW M5 series photos,
and another is dedicated to photos of English Bull Terriers, and the name of the board is
“Bad Bullz”.

Figure 9 - Pinterest profile

Interestingly, there is a Facebook account using the same fake name “Dee Inconegro”, with
only a few posts. However, we can see references to this account in other users’ posts, one
of which referred to the account by an older name, “Keyser Sensei” (See Figure 11), which
we found amusing as it appears to be a reference to the mysterious crime lord character—
Keyser Söze in the movie, Usual Suspects.

13/26

Figure 10 - Dee Inconegro Facebook
profile

14/26

Figure 11 - Facebook post linking to Dee Inconegro profile
Additionally, this account is linked through multiple friends to another account with the name
“Chuck Larock”, which appears to be an older account of the same actor, where he shared
photos of his English Bull Terriers. However, this name is also an alias, not the real name of
the threat actor.

15/26

Figure 12 - Chuck Larock Facebook profile

Even though the threat actor is careful to never use his real name when creating social
media or forum accounts, a comment from one of “Chuck Larock’s” Facebook friends gives
us a clue.

Figure 13 - Facebook comment
16/26

The comment, where a friend says: “yo [name redacted] ca va” which casually means “hey,
how are you?” in French. This might easily be overlooked, because the name the friend calls
out in the comment is not a common name and not meaningful by itself. However, in the
context of Dee Inconegro’s Facebook page, we find another clue. From public records, we
learn that Dee Inconegro’s listed employer, [company name redacted.ca], is actually owned
by a man who goes by [name redacted], a Canadian citizen of Haitian descent.

Figure 14 - Business registration for [company name redacted]

It appears that [company name redacted.ca] is a sole-proprietor business, operated from a
residential address in Montreal. One former Google Street View photo shows an image of
the location with two BMWs in the driveway and a person (possibly our threat actor) standing
in front.

17/26

Figure 15 - Google Street View image of [name redacted.ca] office

This name matches another email address posted by the account on the Montreal Racing
forums, [name redacted]@sympatico.ca.

18/26

Figure 16 – crazyteg67 asking for photo

References to the number “67” in usernames used by the threat actor and his associates
could suggest an affiliation with the Montreal 67s, a Haitian street gang.

About the Golden Chickens Malware Suite—a Modular Malware
Golden Chickens is a stealthy, highly functional, all-in-one suite of malware. It consists of
various components that threat actors can select for their objectives:
More_eggs – This is the Golden Chickens‘ key component. More_eggs provides threat
actors with a back door and a malware loader.
VenomLNK – Initial access for more_eggs. VenomLNK is a .lnk file (Windows shortcut) sent
to victims to instigate User Execution.
TerraLoader – The primary goal of VenomLNK is to instantiate TerraLoader which can then
load the individual objective-based plugins.
TerraRecon – Performs initial environmental analysis of the infected machine and provides
threat actors with some rudimentary information of the organization‘s network.
TerraStealer – Harvests credentials and emails from browsers, email clients, and transfer
utilities.
TerraTV – Allows threat actors to move laterally in the network by hijacking the
organization‘s running instance of TeamViewer.
TerraPreter – Provides a meterpreter shell that allows threat actors to perform actions such
as lateral movement, discovery, and credential theft manually.
TerraCrypt – An encryption payload for ransomware extortion attacks.

TRU Detects a New Golden Chickens Campaign & E-Commerce Companies
Appear to Be the Targets
Since the beginning of 2022, TRU has observed several incidents in which VenomLNK, a
.lnk file (a Windows shortcut) sent to victims to instigate User Execution, was leveraged to
target corporate hiring managers in the U.S. A single sample uploaded to VirusTotal in July
2022, from France, pointed to a new resume-themed download server, suggesting ongoing
cyberattacks utilizing Golden Chickens. The associated URL indicates the malware is being
used to go after e-Commerce companies, which we know is a favorite target of FIN6, the
financial crime group known for successfully compromising large e-Commerce companies
including British Airways, Newegg, Ticketmaster and countless others.
In order to deliver VenomLNK to victims and ensure that they click on them, the Golden
Chickens operators leverage employee recruitment processes. The threat actors engage
targets through services such as LinkedIn, Indeed, and the organization‘s own careers
section of their website. In the past, operators started by engaging the victim on LinkedIn,
eventually following up with a job offer through email.
In the July campaign, VenomLNK is hosted on a personal branding web page (See Figures
18 and 19). The operators then send a link leading to a mock resume PDF through the
organization‘s recruitment platform (e.g. Indeed, LinkedIn, or the organization‘s own career
web page). The PDF purports to be broken, offering an embedded link (Figure 20) to the
malicious VenomLNK file on the branding website, which the victim then downloads and
executes manually after completing a CAPTCHA.

21/26

Figure 18: The landing page of the personal branding website hosting VenomLNK

Figure19: Personal branding website hosting VenomLNK

Figure 20: The only content in the PDF is a fake error message with a link directing the victim
to download VenomLNK
22/26

Using a CAPTCHA on a website makes it harder for security researchers and their tools,
especially if those tools are automated, to retrieve and analyze if there is any malware
present. Evasion tactics, like this, are a clever way for threat actors trying to get a foothold
into an e-Commerce company to increase their chances of success.

A $200,000 Bounty Issued for badbullzvenom on July 18, 2022
Not only has TRU detected what appears to be a new Golden Chickens attack campaign, but
on July 18, 2022, a threat actor going by “babay” went on to Exploit.in and accused
badbullzvenom of stealing $1 million from him. Consequently, babay issued a $200,000
bounty for any information leading to badbullzvenom’s real identity. See Figure 21.

Figure 21: A threat actor on Exploit.in accuses badbullzvenom of stealing $1 million from him
and offers a $200,000 bounty for any information leading to badbullzvenom’s real identity

The translation of the complaint made on July 18, 2022, by babay about badbullzvenom in
Exploit.in:
23/26

“[email protected] a.k.a. badbullzvenom
The total cost of the complaint $1,000,000.
The person scammed me, didn't complete his job, talk total nonsense, I can't contact him
and he refuses to return the money back. The situation is private, I sent the logs to the
admin.
For the information that can lead to his deanonymization I will pay $200,000 through the
guarantor.”
The translation of Exploit.in’s Administrator/Moderator’s response to babay:
“I have looked through the logs, the user is deleted from the forum.”

The Significance of Discovering the Identity of the Golden Chickens
Operator
1. The connection to The Billion Dollar Hackers: The Golden Chickens MaaS is a
favorite cyber weapon of three of the longest-running and successful financial crime
gangs on the Underground: Russia-based FIN6 and Cobalt Group, and Evilnum, a
hacker group suspected to operate out of Belarus, a neighbor and ally of Russia. In
learning more about the threat actor behind Golden Chickens and understanding his
operation, TRU can garner more intelligence about the TTPs of the FIN6, Cobalt Group
and Evilnum operations. This knowledge is invaluable for eSentire and other cyber
defenders, as they develop security protections that will detect, respond and shut down
attacks launched by these threat groups.
2. Collaboration with Law Enforcement: In 2015, the Trend Micro report about
Frapstar, aka badbullzvenom, provided solid intelligence about this threat actor, giving
law enforcement a real chance of identifying and potentially arresting badbullzvenom
when he was still a minor player on the cybercrime scene. Instead, he has had seven
years to hone his skills, and from our findings, we see that he has continued to get
better at developing malware and obfuscating it. Badbullzvenom is very stealthy, and
he goes to extremes to keep his malware fully undetectable (FUD) by anti-virus, trying
to make sure that samples of Golden Chickens are not uploaded to Virus Total.
Badbullzvenom also insists that his clients ONLY use his malware in very “targeted”
attacks to further ensure that he and his malicious software fly under the radar.
We believe the case of the Golden Chickens operator is a stark example of what can
happen if a threat actor, who is considered “low hanging fruit,” is ignored by law
enforcement. All eSentire’s research has been transitioned to law enforcement for
criminal investigations.

24/26

3. Understanding Golden Chickens Malware: Discovering the identity and activities of
the Golden Chickens operator has enabled Stewart and Keplinger to answer several
questions about the malware suite, such as:
Why do security researchers see so few hacker campaigns involving the Golden
Chickens malware?
How long has badbullzvenom been conducting cyber fraud?
What TTPs does badbullzvenom use to avoid detection?

Conclusion
There is compelling evidence that the threat actor, detailed in this report, is one of possibly
two operators behind the badbullzvenom account on Exploit.in.
Interestingly, as of July 2022, all of badbullzvenom’s posts on Exploit.in have been purged
from the forum. However, TRU continues to see improvements in the Golden Chickens
source code and new Golden Chickens attack campaigns, like the one we detected in July.
That tells us that the malware suite is still actively being developed and is being and sold to
other threat actors. We expect to see further targeted attacks against financial institutions
and organizations, processing large amounts of credit and debit card data, leveraging this
malware in the foreseeable future. Thus, TRU is continuing to investigate the Golden
Chickens operation and any other parties that may be involved.
It is TRU’s recommendation that organizations take the following steps to protect against the
Golden Chickens malware suite:
1. Employ exhaustive endpoint monitoring for LOLBINs, aka Trusted Windows Binary
abuse. LOLBINs of interest include cmd.exe, wscript.exe, wmic.exe, cmstp.exe,
msxsl.exe, powershell.exe, and ie4uinit.exe.Ensure endpoint products have rules in
place to detect suspicious usage of these Windows processes.
2. Ensure employees are aware of common phishing tactics:
Be suspicious of attachments from people you don’t know – additional care is
required in cases where you must accept documents from the public (such as
with employee hiring process)
Inspect attachment file types by right clicking the file and selecting properties
Documents should never come as LNK, ISO, or VBS files
Often, these malicious files will be enclosed in a .zip file to bypass email filters

25/26

3. Have an easy process in place for reporting phishing and suspicious behavior
Leadership is responsible for ensuring a positive and convenient path is in place
for reporting suspicious behavior
Develop a collaborative culture of cyber resiliency where employees are
comfortable to bring forward questions, and even mistakes when it comes to
email behavior and downloads. Punishing employees for falling for phishing
scams will reduce the chances that they – and other employees – report them in
the future.
4. Engage Managed Detection and Response services for 24/7 Security Monitoring,
Threat Hunting and Threat Containment expertise. The speed with which you can
detect and contain a threat actor before they achieve their objectives is imperative in
preventing business disruption.
