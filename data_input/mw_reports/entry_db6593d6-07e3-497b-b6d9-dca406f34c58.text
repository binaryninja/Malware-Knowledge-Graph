After the infamous Conti ransomware group was disbanded, its former members started to
target energy and power sectors with a new unknown ransomware payload. The intelligence
derived by Quick Heal researchers had already identified the Energy and Power sector as a
segment prone to cyberattacks and had increased the vigil on the same. This proactive
monitoring proved fruitful soon after we identified one of the recent premium entities attacked
in this segment. Our investigation and analysis determined that the new LockBit 3.0
ransomware variant caused the infection. The same has been claiming its dominance over
other ransomware groups this year.

Fig. 1 – Ransom Note
The entity that bore the brunt of this ransomware attack had endpoints at multiple locations,
connected with each other & the server in a mesh-topology spread across numerous
locations. From the logs of multiple systems and telemetry, we observed that Windows SysInternal tool PSEXEC was utilized from an unprotected system to execute the ransomware
payload (Lock.exe) on all the systems laterally. The noteworthy observation was that only the
shared drives were found to be encrypted.
Initial access was obtained via brute forcing techniques where multiple user names were
used for lateral movement. The encryption timestamp was in the early morning of 27-June2022. Anti-forensic activities were also observed, which cleared event logs, killed multiple
tasks, and deleted services simultaneously.

Initial Analysis
The service PSEXESVC was first observed to be installed a week before the encryption, with
successful SMB connections surging just before the encryption. Malicious BAT files were
executed by the same service only on one endpoint:
C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /c “”openrdp.bat” “
C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /c “”mimon.bat” “
C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /c “”auth.bat” “
C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /c “”turnoff.bat” “
PSEXESVC executed the ransomware payload that must have a valid key passed along with
the command-line option ‘-pass’. The encrypted files were appended with .zbzdbs59d
extension which suggests that random generation was done with each payload.

Engine and ARW Telemetry show that the ransomware payload (Lock.exe) was detected at
multiple locations on the same day. This shows that the payload was dropped in all these
systems but was detected by AV.

Payload Analysis
All the sections on the payload are encrypted, which can only be decrypted bypassing the
decryption key as a command-line parameter ‘-pass’. The key obtained for this sample is:
60c14e91dc3375e4523be5067ed3b111
The key is further processed to decrypt specific sections in memory that are obtained by
traversing the PEB and later calls the decrypted sections.

Being packed and having only a few imports, Win32 APIs are resolved by decrypting the
obfuscated string with XOR using the key 0x3A013FD5.

Privilege Escalation
When Admin privileges are not present during execution, it uses CMSTPLUA COM for UAC
bypass to elevate the privileges with another instance of the ransomware payload,
terminating the current process.

Service Deletion and Process Termination
Process terminated included SecurityHealthSystray.exe and the mutex created during
execution was 13fd9a89b0eede26272934728b390e06. Services were enumerated using a
pre-defined list and were deleted if found on the machine:
1. Sense
2. Sophos
3. Sppsvc
4. Vmicvss
5. Vmvss
6. Vss
7. Veeam
8. Wdnissvc
9. Wscsvc
10. EventLog
Anti-Debugging Technique
Threads used for file encryption were hidden from the debugger using
NtSetInformationThread function with undocumented value (ThreadHideFromDebugger =
0x11) for ThreadInformationClass parameter.

File Encryption
Before starting file encryption, the malware associated an icon to encrypted files by creating
and writing it into an image file in the C:\ProgramData directory as zbzdbs59d.ico. Files
were encrypted by creating multiple threads where each filename was replaced with a
random string generated and appending the extension to them.

The ransom note ‘zbzdbs59d.README.txt’ is created inside every directory except the
Program Files and the Windows directory, which aren’t encrypted. It contains instructions to
install the TOR browser, links for a chat along with the personal ID and ends with the
warnings as usual. The victim machine’s wallpaper is modified with the name ‘LockBit Black’
and mentions the instructions to be followed:

Anti-Forensic Activity
As part of wiping out its traces, the ransomware disabled Windows Event Logs by setting
multiple registry subkeys to value 0.

Conclusion
7/10

Unprotected systems in the network were brute-forced to run the PSEXEC tool for lateral
movement across the systems to execute the ransomware payload. With LockBit 3.0
introducing its bug bounty program and adopting new extortion tactics, it is mandatory to take
precautions like downloading applications only from trusted sources, using antivirus for
enhanced protection, and avoiding clicking on any links received through email or social
media platforms.
