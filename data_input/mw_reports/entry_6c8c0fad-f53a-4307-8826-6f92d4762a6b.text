UCID902: Uncovering nation state watering hole credential
harvesting campaigns targeting human rights activists by APT threat
group UCID902
Threat Report – by Ovi Liber @ Interlab

Introduction
Since 2021, Interlab has closely been monitoring events conducted by an advanced
persistent threat group we track with Unidentified Cluster ID (UCID) – UCID902. Based on
our analysis, we conclude the attempts made by this actor demonstrate continued targeting
of human rights groups and activists related to advocacy of human rights in North Korea. In
addition, we are continually observing this actor utilise the compromising of legitimate
business websites to host their phishing kits. We believe this to be a result of either
comprising of the original website developer’s infrastructure, or exploitation of the web
servers themselves. We have found that the actor is a motivated, well-resourced advanced
persistent threat with motivations that relate closely to those demonstrated by hostile threat
groups based in North Korea. The targeted threats by this group closely align with the
1/9

mission of North Korea’s foreign intelligence service, Reconnaissance General Bureau
(RGB). This cluster overlaps with that of ESTSecurity’s cluster which they call “Kumsong
121”.
It should be noted that there are many overlaps between UCID902 and threat group
“Kimsuky” in regards to TTPs, motivations and modus operandi (MO), however, at the time of
writing this, we have yet to see this activity group fall into our cluster for Kimsuky.
In this report we will highlight two events from our cluster that demonstrate the activity and
attack campaigns lead by UCID902.
On 2023-03-17, Interlab received a sample from an NGO that supports North Korean
refugees. We found that this phishing campaign used a KISA Security Notification
email as a lure, synonymous with historical campaigns (example:
https://www.dailynk.com/20210510-3/). In addition, the phishing page mimicked that of
a Naver login page, which was hosted on a legitimate Law Firm’s website, resulting in a
watering hole attack. The same web server IP, hosting the Law Firm’s website, was
also seen mimicking a Naver login page on 2023-01-27 on a Child Education website;
which we saw involved in a targeted credential harvesting campaign against a Korean
University professor. Both these sites were developed by the same developer and
hosted on that developer’s webserver. The web developer was a company based in
Seoul.
On 2023-01-25, Interlab received a sample from an activist based in South Korea who
works on North Korean human rights. This campaign used a Naver alert message as
an email lure, and directed the victim to a fake Naver login page hosted on a legitimate
Medical Research Institutions website, indicating a watering hole attack. The server IP
of this website was also seen on three other separate watering hole attacks we
tracked. All three occasions saw credential harvesting campaigns targeting victims
related to the MO of UCID902. These campaigns were also hosting Naver login pages.
The websites used in the watering hole attacks described above were four differing
Medical Research Institutions, which all shared the same web development company
and server IP address.

Understanding UCID902’s credential harvesting operation
We first observed UCID902 on 2021-07-12 delivering credential phishing campaigns to
activists based in the Republic of Korea. The lures aimed to appear as Naver security alerts,
prompting users to input credentials, as seen in Figure 1. From 2021 to 2023, we have seen
continued efforts by UCID902 to compromise credentials from victims with the same lures
and phishing kits. These lures all are synonymous with Naver security events or similar.

Throughout this time, Interlab has made direct correlations within subsequent campaigns by
UCID902 between events in both infrastructure (IP addresses, domains and SMTP hosts),
capabilities (phishing kit) & victimology. In addition, and most notability, the actor relies
heavily on watering hole attacks by compromising legitimate organisations within Korea to
host phishing pages. These organisations appear to be legitimate businesses or institutions
with a diverse range of industries. However, it is not the organisations themselves that relate,
but the hosting provider. Throughout our tracking, we have identified many campaigns where
phishing kits were hosted on legitimate company websites indicating a compromise of the
website; all of these websites, within specific time windows, were hosted by the same
3/9

hosting provider or hosted IP. In recent campaigns, late 2022 to early 2023, we saw constant
usage of phishing kits hosted on websites built by one specific hosting provider based in
Seoul, Republic of Korea. One notable characteristic of the phish kit we have observed
is that it will verify that originating client has visited the page via a common useragent and residential IP – if it doesn’t it will redirect to the legitimate Naver login page. As a
result of this methodology, with medium to high confidence, we conclude that one of
UCID902’s attack credential comprise methodology appears as this attack path
demonstrated in Figure 2 as of 2023-03-17. We would like industry partners and
governmental support to validate and understand this attack method, in order to defend the
human rights ecosphere from this threat actor. Because of this, we welcome and encourage
industry or governmental contribution or enrichment to this intelligence.

UCID902's credential watering hole attack pattern
Historically, we have seen more generic campaigns targeting Naver users, to which this
actor’s phish kits can often appear like. However, our first indication that this actor shares
political and operational motivations as threat actors based in North Korea, began in early
2022. We observed with high confidence specific infrastructure and capability
correlations with a campaign targeting activists with lures masquerading as The
Ministry of Unification. This campaign included a malicious HWP document which we
identified with correlations to campaigns led by APT group Kimsuky. It should be noted that
this infrastructure overlap is not a common feature within our UCID902 cluster, resulting in
these specific correlations being notable findings in understanding UCID902’s scope. Thus,
we note that the socio-political axis of this actor closely overlaps with motivations by known
threat groups based in North Korea.

with infrastructure and capability overlap with other UCID902 credential harvesting
campaigns
Due to the infrastructure, capabilities, modus operandi, victimology and other meta-features,
we believe with confidence that the threat group we classify as UCID902 are an advanced
persistent threat focused on compromising credentials of activists working on North Korean
human rights related activities and the unification of Korea. It should also be noted that many
of the spear-phishing lures contained in campaigns led by UCID902 relate specifically to
North Korean activities that would be of interest by the victims. A highly motivated actor such

as this demonstrates many hallmarks of a threat group based in North Korea, however at this
time we should note that we do not have enough data points correlating to other known
threat groups, such as Kimsuky, to affirm with confidence if this operation is led by them.

The phish kits observed in campaigns lead by UCID902 do not appear to differ throughout
our observations since 2021. Across our cluster, we have indexed DOM content of all
phishing sites observed in these campaigns, resulting in all of them correlating with each
other. In the phishing email, the URI (contained as a link on the green button displayed in
Figure 4) contains two values that determine the targeted and the redirect. We have
identified a specific encoding which the actor utilises to encode the request query
parameters, which we have seen throughout campaigns lead by UCID902. When the user
inputs credentials on the phish kit, we note the credentials are send in a POST request back
to the comprised hosting webserver. If the originating GET request doesn’t meet
requirements or contain the victim identifier, the user is redirected to a different website
(figure 5).

In addition, throughout campaigns lead by UCID902, email headers within the spear-phishing
campaigns often showed the SMTP mail originating from the same infrastructure as the
phishing kit and sender address containing a domain owned by the web development
company.
