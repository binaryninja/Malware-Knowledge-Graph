APT29
attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016

APT29 is threat group that has been attributed to Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).[1][2] They have operated since at least 2008,
often targeting government networks in Europe and NATO member countries, research institutes, and think tanks. APT29 reportedly
compromised the Democratic National Committee starting in the summer of 2015.[3][4][5][6]
In April 2021, the US and UK governments attributed the SolarWinds supply chain compromise cyber operation to the SVR; public statements
included citations to APT29, Cozy Bear, and The Dukes.[7][8] Victims of this campaign included government, consulting, technology, telecom,
and other organizations in North America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Industry reporting referred to the actors involved in this
campaign as UNC2452, NOBELIUM, StellarParticle, and Dark Halo.[9][10][11][12][13]
