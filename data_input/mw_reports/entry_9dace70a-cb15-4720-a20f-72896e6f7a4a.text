I’ve been sitting on this one for quite a while now, and figured what with SonicWall back in
the news for getting owned via some 0days in their own shit products, it would be somewhat
amusing to release this. I’m fairly sure its patched by now. Anyway, its lockdown 3.0 so you
should stay inside and do crime bug bounties. I’ve shared various versions of this exploit in
the past with people, so its not exactly a huge secret.
This bug isn’t even mine, it comes courtesy of Phineas Fisher, who used it to breach Hacking
Team and later some other organisations. I would seriously advise aspiring hackers of any
hat colour to closely study the work of Phineas for ideas on how they can improve their
hacking. It’s very instructive.
TL;DR: SonicWall “Virtual Office” SSL-VPN Products ship a fucking ancient version of Bash
vulnerable to ShellShock, and are therefore vulnerable to unauthenticated remote code
execution (as a “nobody” user) via the /cgi-bin/jarrewrite.sh URL.
The exploit is incredibly trivial. We simply spaff a shellshock payload containing a bash
/dev/tcp backconnect at it, and we get a shell. Now, the environment on these things is
incredibly limited – its stripped down Linux. But we have bash, openssl, and FTP. So you
could always download your own toolkit for further exploitation.
Anyway, here is the public exploit. It is incredibly trivial and recycles the telnetlib handler for
reverse shells from exploits released by Stephen Seeley.

Exploit in Action.
There is also a couple of ways to get root on these, the dos2unix program is setuid-root for
a start. This can be abused by someone clever enough to get root. I’ve decided to leave this
as an exercise for the reader and remove that function from the published exploit. The kernel
is painfully ancient as well.
It should also be noted that these things talk to AD for authentication, and that in the ones
I’ve come across while working, the /tmp directory is often littered with Kerberos
authentication things. Phineas had another way of getting inside AD by simply replacing a
CGI script with a trojan version that you could probably implement.
As for how many of these there are in the wild? A few thousand at least. I’ve not done any
real scanning for obvious reasons of “I don’t commit crimes”, but the following Shodan
searches show up a decent number of them:

http.favicon.hash:-2012355198 .

You can likely work out other Shodan queries for these and find a bunch more of them. I’m
not particularly willing to bother poking random peoples VPN servers, and only have
fingerprints for ones I encountered on engagements.
Anyway, the only recommendation I have if you use these products is to unplug them, douse
them in kerosene, and set them on fire. It is the only way to be safe from something
seemingly developed with this level of negligence.
Footnote: the webserver in use seems to be called “EasyAccess”, with the CGI script living in
the path: /usr/src/EasyAccess/www/cgi-bin . A very apt name, really.
Footnote 2.0, the other foot drops: SonicWall claim this was fixed in 2015, in this tweet.
Finally! Some answers! Good sports they were about it and all! SMA 8.0.0.4 is where it is
finally killed off.
Still doesn’t answer why they were using a Bash version from 2002, or a kernel version from
like, 2005, but whatever. Nothing new in the world of appliances, really.
