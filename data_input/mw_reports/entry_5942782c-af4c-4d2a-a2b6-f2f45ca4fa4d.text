Summary & Key Findings
Circles is a surveillance firm that reportedly exploits weaknesses in the global mobile
phone system to snoop on calls, texts, and the location of phones around the globe.
Circles is affiliated with NSO Group, which develops the oft-abused Pegasus spyware.
Circles, whose products work without hacking the phone itself, says they sell only to
nation-states. According to leaked documents, Circles customers can purchase a
system that they connect to their local telecommunications companies’ infrastructure,
or can use a separate system called the “Circles Cloud,” which interconnects with
telecommunications companies around the world.
According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, all U.S. wireless networks are
vulnerable to the types of weaknesses reportedly exploited by Circles. A majority of
networks around the globe are similarly vulnerable.
Using Internet scanning, we found a unique signature associated with the hostnames
of Check Point firewalls used in Circles deployments. This scanning enabled us to
identify Circles deployments in at least 25 countries.
We determine that the governments of the following countries are likely Circles
customers: Australia, Belgium, Botswana, Chile, Denmark, Ecuador, El Salvador,
Estonia, Equatorial Guinea, Guatemala, Honduras, Indonesia, Israel, Kenya, Malaysia,
Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, Peru, Serbia, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates (UAE),
Vietnam, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.

Some of the specific government branches we identify with varying degrees of
confidence as being Circles customers have a history of leveraging digital technology
for human rights abuses. In a few specific cases, we were able to attribute the
deployment to a particular customer, such as the Security Operations Command
(ISOC) of the Royal Thai Army, which has allegedly tortured detainees.

1. Background
The public discussion around surveillance and tracking largely focuses on well known
technical means, such as targeted hacking and network interception. However, other forms
of surveillance are regularly and extensively used by governments and third parties to
engage in cross-border surveillance and monitoring.
One of the widest-used—but least appreciated—is the leveraging of weaknesses in the
global mobile telecommunications infrastructure to monitor and intercept phone calls and
traffic.
While well-resourced governments have long had the ability to conduct such activity, in
recent years companies have emerged to sell these capabilities. For example, the Guardian
reported in March 2020 that Saudi Arabia appeared to be “exploiting weaknesses in the
global mobile telecommunications network to track citizens as they travel around the US.”
Other investigative reports indicated that journalists, dissidents, and opposition politicians in
Nigeria and Guatemala were similarly targeted.
Abuse of the global telephone system for tracking and monitoring is believed to be
widespread, however it is difficult to investigate. When a device is tracked—or messages
intercepted—there are not necessarily any traces on the target’s device for researchers or
investigators to find. Meanwhile, cellular carriers have many technical difficulties identifying
and blocking abuses of their infrastructure.

SS7 Attacks
Signaling System 7 (SS7) is a protocol suite developed in 1975 for exchanging information
and routing phone calls between different wireline telecommunications companies. At the
time of SS7’s development, the global phone network consisted of a small club of
monopolistic telecommunications operators. Because these companies generally trusted
each other, SS7 designers saw no pressing need to include authentication or access control.
However, the advent of telecommunications deregulation and mobile technology soon began
to challenge the assumption of trust. Even so, SS7 endured, thanks to a desire to maintain
interoperability with older equipment.
Because of SS7’s lack of authentication, any attacker that interconnects with the SS7
network (such as an intelligence agency, a cybercriminal purchasing SS7 access, or a
surveillance firm running a fake phone company) can send commands to a subscriber’s
3/27

“home network” falsely indicating that the subscriber is roaming. These commands allow the
attacker to track the victim’s location, and intercept voice calls and SMS text messages.
Such capabilities could also be used to intercept codes used for two-factor authentication
sent via SMS. It is challenging and expensive for telecommunications operators to
distinguish malicious traffic from benign behavior, making these attacks tricky to block.
Today, SS7 is predominantly used in 2G and 3G mobile networks (4G networks use the
newer Diameter protocol). One of SS7’s key functions in these networks is handling roaming,
where a subscriber to a “home network” can connect to a different “visited network,” such as
when traveling internationally. In this situation, SS7 is used to handle forwarding of phone
calls and SMS text messages to the “visited network.” Although 4G’s Diameter protocol
includes features for authentication and access control, these are optional. Additionally, the
need for Diameter networks to interconnect with SS7 networks also introduces security
issues. There is widespread concern that 5G technology and other advances will inherit the
risks of these older systems.

Circles
While companies selling exploitation of the global cellular system tend to operate in secrecy,
one company has emerged as a known player: Circles. The company was reportedly
founded in 2008, acquired in 2014 by Francisco Partners, and then merged with NSO Group.
Circles is known for selling systems to exploit SS7 vulnerabilities, and claims to sell this
technology exclusively to nation-states.
Unlike NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware, the SS7 mechanism by which Circles’ product
reportedly operates does not have an obvious signature on a target’s phone, such as the
telltale targeting SMS bearing a malicious link that is sometimes present on a phone targeted
with Pegasus.
Most investigation of Circles has relied on inside sources and open source intelligence,
rather than technical analysis. For example, a 2016 investigation by Nigerian newspaper
Premium Times reported that two state governors in Nigeria acquired Circles systems and
used them to spy on political opponents. In one case, the system was installed at the
residence of a governor. Our scanning found two Circles systems in Nigeria (Section 4).
Documents filed as part of a lawsuit against NSO Group in Israel purport to show emails
exchanged between Circles and several customers in the UAE. Most famously, the
documents show Circles sending targets’ locations and phone records (Call Detail Records
or CDRs) to the UAE Supreme Council on National Security (SCNS), apparently as part of a
product demonstration. The emails also indicate that intercepting phone calls of a foreign
target has a higher chance of success when the target is roaming.

4/27

Figure 1: The logo of Circles.
The same documents explain some facets of how the Circles system operated. The SCNS
was set to receive two separate systems: a standalone system that could be used for local
interceptions and a separate system connected to the “Circles Cloud” (an entity with roaming
agreements around the world) that could be used for interceptions outside of the UAE if
desired.

Global targeting & interception

In 2015, IntelligenceOnline suggested that Circles started a bogus phone company called
“Circles Bulgaria” to facilitate interceptions around the world. More recently, a 2020 report by
Forensic News raised questions as to the true business of FloLive, purportedly an “IoT
connectivity” company. Forensic News found that FloLive appeared to be closely associated
with Circles, and suggested that the company might be a “front for the hackers and private
spies behind Circles.”
There is also limited information about how the Circles system integrates with NSO Group’s
flagship Pegasus spyware, though a former NSO Group employee told Motherboard that
Pegasus had an “awful integration with Circles,” and that Circles had “exaggerated their
system’s abilities.”

2. Fingerprinting & Scanning for Circles
While searching Shodan, we observed interesting results in AS200068, a block of IP
addresses registered to Circles Bulgaria (Figure 2). These results show hostnames of
firewalls manufactured by Check Point, as well as the hostnames of the firewalls’

5/27

SmartCenter instance. SmartCenter can be used to centrally manage multiple Check Point
firewalls.1

Figure 2: Shodan probe results for Check Point firewalls in AS200068 (Circles Bulgaria Ltd).
The SmartCenter hostnames in the Circles-registered AS200068 contain the domain name
tracksystem.info. It seems clear that tracksystem.info is associated with Circles, as leaked
documents show Circles employees communicating from @tracksystem.info email
addresses. Additionally, per RiskIQ, 17 of the 37 IP addresses pointed to by tracksystem.info
or its subdomains are in AS200068 as well as AS60097, also registered to Circles Bulgaria.
We searched for Check Point firewalls whose SmartCenter hostname contained
tracksystem.info on Shodan, Censys, Fofa, and on Rapid7’s historical sonar-ssl dataset. We
also searched for IPs that returned peculiar “random” TLS certificates2 matching the
following regular expression, as we saw these certificates returned by Check Point firewalls
with tracksystem.info in their SmartCenter hostnames:
/^C=[a-zA-Z0-9]{2}, ST=[a-zA-Z0-9]{3}, L=[a-zA-Z0-9]{3}, O=[a-zA-Z0-9]{4}, OU=[a-zA-Z0-9]
{5}, CN=localhost$/
Overall, we identified 252 IP addresses in 50 ASNs matching our fingerprints. Many had a
“Firewall Host” field seemingly indicating that the systems were client systems, e.g., clientcircles-thailand-nsb-node-2, though some used the word telco in place of client, and some

6/27

had a generic name rather than a client name, e.g., cf-00-182-1. In cases where we
identified Circles’ Check Point firewalls on a Transit/Access ISP (i.e., a non-datacenter ISP),
we assumed that some agency of that country’s government was a customer of Circles.
Some of the clients that we identified have two-word nicknames, where the first word is a car
brand that almost always shares the same first letter as the country or state of the apparent
customer. For example, Circles firewalls whose IPs geolocate to Mexico are named
“Mercedes,” those that geolocate to Thailand are named “Toyota,” those that geolocate to
Abu Dhabi are named “Aston,” and those that geolocate to Dubai are named “Dutton.”
The use of car brands to refer to clients was first reported by Haaretz, though the report
indicated that this was an NSO Group practice, as opposed to Circles. Haaretz reported the
following codenames: Saudi Arabia is “Subaru,” Bahrain is “BMW,” and Jordan is “Jaguar.”
Our scans did not reveal any Check Point firewalls linked to Circles with the names Subaru
or Jaguar, though we did identify firewalls with the name “BMW” located in Belgium.

3. A Global List of Circles Deployments
From the 252 IP addresses we detected in 50 ASNs, we identified 25 governments that are
likely to be Circles customers. We also identified 17 specific government branches that
appear to be Circles customers, based on WHOIS, passive DNS, and historical scanning
data from Check Point firewall IPs or their neighbours.
Australia, Belgium, Botswana (Directorate of Intelligence and Security Services), Chile
(Investigations Police), Denmark (Army Command), Ecuador, El Salvador, Estonia,
Equatorial Guinea, Guatemala (General Directorate of Civil Intelligence), Honduras
(National Directorate of Investigation and Intelligence), Indonesia, Israel, Kenya, Malaysia,
Mexico (Mexican Navy; State of Durango), Morocco (Ministry of Interior), Nigeria (Defence
Intelligence Agency), Peru (National Intelligence Directorate), Serbia (Security Information
Agency), Thailand (Internal Security Operations Command; Military Intelligence Battalion;
Narcotics Suppression Bureau), the United Arab Emirates (Supreme Council on National
Security; Dubai Government; Royal Group), Vietnam, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.
While our analysis yielded country results with high confidence, our efforts to determine the
customer identity have, in some cases, a lower degree of confidence.

7/27

Figure 3: Countries that appear to have at least one Circles client.
We also found evidence of at least four systems that we were unable to connect to a
particular country (Appendix A).

4. Spotlight on Concerning Circles Deployments
Our research identified deployments in 25 countries. In several cases, we were able to go
further and identify technical elements pointing to a particular government customer with
varying degrees of certainty. Troublingly, in a number of these cases, the government as a
whole, or the government client in particular, have a history of misuse of surveillance
technologies and human rights abuses. While several cases are highlighted here, Appendix
A lists the additional deployments found by our fingerprinting.

Botswana
We identified two Circles systems in Botswana: an unnamed system and a system named
Bentley Bullevard that appears to be operated by Botswana’s Directorate of Intelligence and
Security Service (DISS), as TLS certificates used on the Check Point firewalls were signed
by a self-signed TLS certificate for “CN=sid.org.bw” which is a domain name used by the
Directorate of Intelligence and Security. The DISS is sometimes referred to as the
“Directorate of Intelligence and Security” (DIS).

Surveillance Abuses in Botswana
There are multiple recent reports of the abuse of surveillance equipment in Botswana to
suppress reporting and public awareness of governmental corruption. In 2014, it was
reported that the DISS participated in using surveillance and jamming technology developed
by Elbit Systems to conduct “electronic warfare” against the media. In addition, the DISS has
reportedly engaged in attempts to compromise the privacy of relationships between sources
and reporters.

Chile
Our scanning identified what appeared to be a single Circles system in Chile, codename
Cadillac Polaris. The system appears to be operated by the Investigations Police of Chile
(PDI), as the Check Point firewalls identify the client as “Chile PDI.” The PDI is Chile’s main
law enforcement agency. The Chile PDI was also a customer of Hacking Team’s Remote
Control System (RCS) spyware, although they claimed that the spyware was only used for
prosecuting crimes with prior judicial authorization.

Surveillance Abuses in Chile
Between 2017 and 2018, Chile’s other major national police agency, the Carabineros,
reportedly illegally intercepted the calls, WhatsApp chats, and Telegram messages of
multiple journalists. Chilean police also intercepted the communications of Indigenous
Mapuche leaders and cited intercepted chats to justify the arrests. However, officials were
later prosecuted for planting false evidence on the leaders’ phones.

Guatemala

We identified a single Circles system in Guatemala, Ginetta Galileo. The system appears to
have been operated by the General Directorate of Civil Intelligence (DIGICI), as public

Surveillance Abuses in Guatemala
A 2018 investigation by Guatemalan newspaper Nuestro Diario found that an Israeli arms
dealer sold a variety of spy tools, including NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware and a Circles
system, to a secret unit within DIGICI. The unit reportedly used the equipment to conduct
illegal surveillance against journalists, businesspeople, and political opponents of the
government. The surveillance arose amidst extreme physical threat to members of civil
society. A recent report identified over 900 attacks between 2017-2018 in Guatemala,
originating from both government and non-state actors.

Mexico
We identified what appear to be ten Circles systems in Mexico. One system, Mercedes
Ventura, appears to have been used by the Mexican Navy (SEMAR). All firewall IPs for the
Mercedes Ventura system were in /24s with multiple other IP addresses that are pointed to
by domain names and return valid TLS certificates for semar.gob.mx and other websites
linked to the Mexican Navy. An unnamed system appears to have been used by the State of
Durango, as one of its firewall IPs was also pointed to by dozens of subdomains of
durango.gob.mx. Additional details about the Mexico Circles systems are in Appendix A.
Reporting has previously connected the Mexican government to the purchase of other SS7
surveillance equipment, such as ULIN made by Ability, as well as a system codenamed
SkyLock sold by Verint Systems Inc.
Surveillance Abuses in Mexico
Mexico has an extensive history of surveillance abuses. Notably, our prior research has
shown that entities within Mexico’s government serially abused NSO Group’s Pegasus
spyware to target over 25 reporters, human rights defenders, and the families of individuals
killed and disappeared by cartels. The pattern of abuses extends to other forms of digital
surveillance.

10/27

Human rights organizations have documented that Mexico’s Navy has been responsible for
civilian casualties in conflicts and human rights violations, including illegal detention,
kidnapping, torture, and sexual torture. Mexico’s National Human Rights Commission
recently confirmed this pattern in a recommendation.

Morocco
Our scanning identified what appeared to be a single Circles system in Morocco. The
Morocco client’s IPs are in the same /27 as several websites of the Bureau central
d’investigation judiciaire (BCIJ), and are in the same /26 as the website of the Moroccan
Auxiliary Forces (FA). Both the FA and BCIJ are under the auspices of Morocco’s Ministry of
Interior. A government agency in Morocco also appears to be a client of Circles’ affiliate NSO
Group, though the identity of this Moroccan agency has not been established.

Morocco has been connected to multiple cases of surveillance abuse over the past decade,
ranging from the targeting of human rights organizations with Hacking Team’s spyware to a
string of more recent cases in which NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware was used to target civil
society within Morocco and abroad.

Nigeria
Our scanning identified two Circles systems in Nigeria. One system may be operated by the
same entity as one of the Nigerian customers of the FinFisher spyware that we detected in
December 2014. The firewall IPs are in the same /27 as the IP address of the FinFisher C&C
server we detected in our 2014 scans (41.242.50.50). The other client appears to be the
Nigerian Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA), as its firewall IPs are in AS37258, a block of IP
addresses registered to “HQ Defence Intelligence Agency Asokoro, Nigeria, Abuja.”

Surveillance Abuses in Nigeria

11/27

Members of civil society in Nigeria face a wide range of digital threats. A recent report by
Front Line Defenders concluded that Nigeria’s government “has conducted mass
surveillance of citizens’ telecommunications.” The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ)
has also reported multiple cases of the Nigerian government abusing phone surveillance.
An investigation by Nigerian newspaper Premium Times found that Nigerian governors of
Bayelsa and Delta states purchased systems from Circles to spy on their political opponents.
In Delta State, Premium Times reports that the system was installed at the “governor’s
lodge,” and operated by employees of the Governor, rather than police. In Bayelsa State, the
governor reportedly used the Circles system to spy on his opponent in an election, as well as
his opponent’s wife and aides. The investigation also found that the two Circles systems
were imported without the proper authorizations from Nigeria’s Office of the National Security
Adviser.

Thailand
Our scanning identified what appear to be three current clients in Thailand. The firewall IP
addresses for Toyota Regency are in the same /29 as the online “War Room” of the Royal
Thai Army’s Internal Security Operations Command (กองอํานวยการรักษาความมั่นคงภายใน),
known as ISOC for short.3 The firewall IP addresses for an unnamed system are in the same
/29 as a wiki that displays the logo of the Military Intelligence Battalion (MIBn) (กองพันขาว
กรองทางทหาร), which appears to be a division of the Army Military Intelligence Command
(หน วยขาวกรองทางทหาร), Thailand’s main military intelligence agency. The third system,
Toyota Dragon, is identified by its Check Point firewalls as “Thailand NSB”, which we
believe is a reference to the Narcotics Suppression Bureau.

Surveillance Abuses in Thailand
Thailand has a history of leveraging a wide range of surveillance technologies to monitor and
harass civil society. Previous Citizen Lab research also identified a Pegasus spyware
operator active within Thailand.

12/27

The ISOC has been accused of torturing and waterboarding activists, and suing activists who
allege torture at the hands of the military. Recently, disturbing reports have emerged of
abductions of Thai dissidents who live outside of Thailand. In one case, three Thai dissidents
living in Laos who criticized Thailand’s military disappeared, and their bodies were later
discovered by a Thai fisherman. Their bodies were “disemboweled and stuffed with concrete
posts” and their limbs broken. While these abductions and killings have not been
conclusively attributed to the Royal Thai Army, the disappearances are reported to have
happened while the leader of Thailand’s former military junta Prayut Chan-o-cha (ประยุทธ
จันทรโอชา) was visiting Laos. Chan-o-cha is the current Prime Minister of Thailand, as well
as the director of ISOC.

United Arab Emirates
Our scanning identified what appear to be three active clients in the UAE: the UAE Supreme
Council on National Security (SCNS) (‫)اﻟﻤﺠﻠﺲ اﻷﻋﻠﻰ ﻟﻸﻣﻦ اﻟﻮﻃﻨﻲ‬, the Dubai Government4, and a
client that may be linked to both Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan’s Royal Group and

We found an unnamed UAE Circles system whose Check Point firewalls were in the same
/25 as websites for Royal Group companies including Mauqah Technology, which famously
acquired and operated Hacking Team’s RCS spyware and, in 2012, used the system to
target (among others) UAE activist Ahmed Mansoor. The command and control (C&C) server
for that spyware briefly pointed to an IP address registered to Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed AlNahyan, the chairman of Royal Group and the UAE’s now National Security Advisor. Sheikh
Tahnoon was also closely linked to ToTok, a popular chat app that was banned from the
Apple and Google Play stores after the New York Times reported it was linked to UAE
intelligence.

13/27

A leaked 2014 invoice indicates a deal between Circles and Al Thuraya Consultancy and
Researches LLC, which appears to be linked to Royal Group. Records obtained by
Lebanese newspaper Al Akhbar from the Abu Dhabi Chamber of Commerce and records on
companies.rafeeg.ae show that Al Thuraya shares a PO Box number (“PO Box 5151, Abu
Dhabi”) and fax number (““8111112””) with Royal Group. Additionally, Al Thuraya’s
commercial license shows “Dhahi Mohammed Hamad Al-Thumairi” as one of the company’s
two partners. Al-Thumairi trained in jiu-jitsu with Sheikh Tahnoon’s adopted son Faisal
Alketbi, received jiu-jitsu encouragement from Sheikh Tahnoon himself, and named his first
son “Tahnoon.” Another of Sheikh Tahnoon’s jiu-jitsu mentees showed up in the ToTok case
as the sole director of Breej Holding, the company listed as the app’s iOS developer.

Figure 4: Links between reported Circles customer Al-Thuraya Consultancy, UAE National
Security Advisor Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, and Mohammed Dahlan.
Al Thuraya has been reported to be the consultancy of Mohammed Dahlan, the former head
of the Palestinian Preventive Security (‫)اﻷﻣﻦ اﻟﻮﻗﺎﺋﻲ‬, and a former member of Fatah’s Central
Committee. Dahlan was ejected from Fatah in June 2011, and subsequently fled to the UAE.
Indeed, the leaked 2014 invoice shows Al Thuraya’s address as “POB 128827, Abu Dhabi,
14/27

United Arab Emirates,” which is listed in WHOIS records for Dahlan’s dahlan.ps website from
September 2013, and was used by Dahlan in June 2017 when he unsuccessfully sued
London-based online newspaper Middle East Eye for libel. Dahlan reportedly ran an
assassination program for the UAE in Yemen that targeted and killed opposition politicians.
Dahlan was also reportedly involved in the recent deal that normalized relations between the
UAE and Israel.
UAE Supreme Council of National Security
In a leaked 2015 exchange, a UAE Supreme Council of National Security (SCNS) official,
Ahmed Ali Al-Habsi, asked Circles to intercept calls for certain phone numbers, apparently
as part of a product demonstration. We found a Circles system named Aston Andromeda
whose firewall IPs were registered to the same SCNS official per public WHOIS data.
The leaked documents also detail a 2016 Circles sale to the UAE National Electronic
Security Authority (NESA) (‫ )اﻟﻬﯿﺌﺔ اﻟﻮﻃﻨﯿﺔ ﻟﻸﻣﻦ اﻹﻟﻜﺘﺮوﻧﻲ‬through DarkMatter. While NESA is a
subsidiary of the SCNS per UAE law, we are not sure whether the SCNS demo and
DarkMatter/NESA deals are related. After Reuters’ reporting on the NESA’s Project Raven
hacking campaign, the NESA was split up into several agencies, including the Signals
Intelligence Agency (‫)ﺟﻬﺎز اﺳﺘﺨﺒﺎرات اﻹﺷﺎرة‬.
Surveillance Abuses in the UAE
The UAE government is a documented serial abuser of surveillance technologies to
suppress dissent and persecute critical voices. Some prominent activists, like Ahmed
Mansoor, an Emirati prisoner of conscience who has been imprisoned by the UAE since
2017, have been surveilled using technology from Hacking Team, Gamma Group’s FinFisher,
technology developed by Project Raven, and NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware.
The UAE’s use of former U.S. National Security Agency employees to target the devices of
dissidents, journalists, and political opponents is also well documented, as is the apparent
use of this targeting to unmask and jail bloggers and others critical of the government. In
some cases, the targets included Americans.

Surveillance Misuse in Zambia

15/27

In 2019, Zambia reportedly arrested a group of bloggers who ran an opposition news site
with the aid of “a cyber-surveillance unit in the offices of Zambia’s telecommunications
regulator,” which “pinpointed the bloggers’ locations” and was “in constant contact with police
units deployed to arrest them.” While Circles’ solution allows governments to track phones, it
is not clear if Zambia’s Circles system was used in this case.

Discussion
Circles is part of a large and growing global surveillance industry catering to government
clients. Many of the government clients who appear to have acquired and/or deployed
Circles technology have a dismal record of abuses of human rights and technical
surveillance capabilities. Many lack public transparency and accountability, and have minimal
or no independent oversight over the activities of their security agencies.

Circles: Another Industry Player Fueling the Proliferation of Unaccountable
Surveillance
It is difficult to investigate and track surveillance companies like Circles that exploit flaws in
the SS7 protocol. Many SS7 attacks require no engagement with targets themselves, and
leave no visible artefacts on targets’ devices that may inadvertently reveal an operation. The
lack of transparency from telecommunications providers about abuses also helps
surveillance companies, and their customers, evade exposure, further increasing the
likelihood of misuse.
The authoritarian profile of some of Circles’ apparent government clients is troubling, but not
surprising. Over the past decade, the explosion of the global surveillance industry has fueled
a massive transfer of spy technology to problematic regimes and security services. These
customers have leveraged their newly-acquired capabilities to abuse human rights and
neutralize political opposition, even beyond their borders. Circles is an especially concerning
case because of their close relationship and reported integration with NSO Group, which has
a notorious record of enabling surveillance abuses.
The Expanding, Unregulated Surveillance Industry
Research by the Citizen Lab and others, including Amnesty International and Privacy
International, has demonstrated that the surveillance industry is poorly regulated and its
products are prone to abuse. The “self-regulation” that companies claim to practice does not
seem to have stemmed the growing tide of abuse cases. In a 2019 report on the surveillance
industry, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom
of opinion and expression called for “an immediate moratorium on the global sale and
transfer of private surveillance technology until rigorous human rights safeguards are put in
place to regulate such practices and guarantee that governments and non-State actors use
the tools in legitimate ways.”

16/27

As the surveillance industry continues to grow relatively unimpeded, spaces for legitimate
democratic activity will continue to shrink. Governments’ ability to protect their citizens, as
well as their own essential services and national security, will also continue to erode. Fixing
this problem will require a direct focus on reforming the surveillance industry, including,
among other steps:
The enactment of more robust domestic, regional, and international legal frameworks—
equipped with meaningful transparency, enforcement, and oversight mechanisms—to
control the export and import of surveillance technology;
Mandatory due diligence obligations on surveillance companies and enforcement
mechanisms with tough penalties for breaches of such obligations; and,
Legislative amendments to fix any legal and regulatory gaps such that parties harmed
by surveillance technology can bring claims against companies for these harms.
In addition to these broader measures focused on the surveillance industry, we believe that
the vulnerabilities inherent in the global telecommunications system require urgent action by
governments and telecommunications providers. The global telecommunications sector
provides significant opportunity for abuse by the surveillance industry and its customers in
light of the continued failure of telecommunications operators and states to prevent such
exploitation. In the discussion below, we set out clear actions that legislators and wireless
operators must take to prevent continued exploitation and abuse.

Sounding the Alarm: A Clear and Present Threat to National Security
According to a recent study, the vast majority of telecommunications networks around the
globe are vulnerable to the kind of techniques reportedly used by Circles. As has been
widely reported, the industry has sought to downplay and conceal these risks. It is no
surprise that reporting indicates that SS7 has been abused by countries like Saudi Arabia to
target individuals around the world, including in the U.S.
A recent survey of E.U. wireless security by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity
(ENISA) concluded that a majority of operators had security measures that could “only cover
basic attacks.” Troublingly, reporting of the scale of these threats remains difficult to achieve,
as SS7 abuse is not within current reporting obligations for the European
telecommunications sector.
In addition, it is known within the industry that some countries fail to meet basic obligations of
due diligence and oversight with respect to their networks, enabling foreign entities access to
SS7 and Diameter for the purposes of conducting global surveillance.
We believe that the historically limited public information about abuses has enabled the
telecommunications industry to further minimize the problem. There is no public reporting
from most telecommunications companies about the scale of the threats to users, the

17/27

number of attacks identified and blocked, or a roadmap for addressing these threats in the
future. This state of affairs will result in predictable, preventable harm to customers across
the globe.
Risks in the U.S.
In April 2017, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) conducted a major study
that concluded: “all U.S. carriers are vulnerable to these exploits, resulting in risks to national
security, the economy, and the Federal Government’s ability to reliably execute national
essential functions.” According to the DHS report, “SS7 and Diameter vulnerabilities can be
exploited by criminals, terrorists, and nation-state actors/foreign intelligence organizations”
and “many organizations appear to be sharing or selling expertise and services” that could
be used to conduct such espionage.
In response to a 2017 letter by Senator Ron Wyden requesting information about what steps
U.S. carriers were taking to secure their networks, AT&T acknowledged that “hundreds of
carriers now have access to SS7, many of them in unstable or unfriendly nations where
credentials can be compromised…even sold on the open market for a fee.” The company
went on to acknowledge that “the trust model is no longer fully reliable.”
In a 2018 letter to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Senator Wyden
revealed that an unnamed U.S. carrier had suffered a SS7-related breach of customer
information, which it reported to federal authorities. Subsequent investigative reporting
revealed that the FCC had ignored expert recommendations by the DHS and instead
espoused a voluntary compliance program at the urging of the wireless industry. Additionally,
the reporting found that, although SMS messages are vulnerable to SS7 interception, the
wireless industry successfully lobbied the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) to keep SMS text messages as an approved method of two factor authentication in
U.S. government standards.
The troubling inability of the U.S. government and telecommunications sector to address
SS7 vulnerabilities is mirrored in many countries around the world.
Risks in Canada
In 2017, a joint investigation undertaken by CBC News and Radio Canada, in cooperation
with German security researchers, demonstrated an SS7 attack against a sitting member of
parliament, Matthew Dubé. With only a telephone number, the investigators were able to use
SS7 vulnerabilities to track Dubé’s precise movements and intercept his calls. The tests were
conducted over both the Rogers and Bell networks.
In its 2018 annual report, Canada’s Privacy Commissioner noted the investigation, flagged
SS7 security weaknesses, and called on the Canadian government and industry to work
together to resolve them. In response, Canada’s signals intelligence agency, the
Communications Security Establishment (CSE), said that “the security issues surrounding
18/27

SS7, have been known for some time” and that it had been working with industry partners to
resolve them. However, CSE also asserted that it “is unable to discuss further details of
meetings with industry partners, and we cannot disclose the participation of individual,
private telecommunications partners.”
For guidance, the CSE suggested the public visit a “mobile security” information page, now
available on the newly established Canada Centre for Cyber Security website in a section on
“infographics.” However, the website and accompanying infographic do not mention SS7
explicitly and provide only basic advice on mobile security practices.
Legislators: Do This Now
Governments across the globe should take action to protect their citizens and their own
operations. Telecommunications regulatory bodies should conduct regular audits of national
networks and mandate carriers to identify, disclose, and address vulnerabilities.
The U.K. government has shown promising leadership in addressing carrier security, with
recently proposed legislation that requires carriers to secure their networks and gives Ofcom
(the U.K. telecommunications regulator) the authority to ensure compliance. The newly
proposed powers granted to Ofcom include the ability to conduct audits and to compel the
production of records and other information related to a carrier’s security efforts. The
proposed law would also, for the first time, require carriers to disclose compromises to their
customers and provide for fines in some cases.
The European Union has also taken note of telecommunication network vulnerabilities and
made recent recommendations that encourage EU nations to conduct regular analyses of
the threat landscape, adopt minimum security standards, and require incident reporting. We
also note that Nordic regulators have undertaken efforts to establish best practices for
protecting their infrastructure from SS7 attacks.
In contrast, the U.S. FCC has shown no will to compel carriers to report incidents or
undertake serious security improvements. Given the rapid proliferation of SS7 and Diameter
exploitation technologies both to states and non-state actors, it seems likely that without
urgent action, U.S. consumers and government operations will be targeted by an
increasingly wide range of potential threats.
Wireless Carriers: Do This Now
We urgently recommend that telecommunication companies examine SS7 and Diameter
traffic originating from providers in countries where we have identified a Circles deployment
for patterns of abuse. The SS7 and Diameter exploitation marketplace, as well as the
wireless threat landscape, are constantly evolving. The recommendations provided by the
DHS are highly relevant: every major wireless carrier should receive an independent SS7
and Diameter audit every 12-18 months, and should address any identified vulnerabilities.
The ENISA also provides a range of security recommendations for carriers.
19/27

We are aware that some providers, such as a number of U.S. companies, are experimenting
with SS7 firewalls, which show promise in reducing some types of attacks. We urge
providers to publicly disclose their roadmaps for addressing SS7 and Diameter
vulnerabilities, and believe that information about SS7 threats should be included in telco
companies’ transparency reporting going forward.

Sounding the Alarm: Recommendations for High Risk Users
Whether you are a journalist, human rights defender, or government employee,
telecommunication network vulnerabilities may make it possible for adversaries to intercept
your verification SMSes and compromise your accounts. If you believe you face threats
because of who you are or what you do from any of the countries mentioned in this report, or
even a country not listed above, we urge you to migrate away from SMS-based two factor
authentication immediately for all accounts where it is possible. Directions on how to use a
security key for some of your accounts are here.
In addition, for accounts on popular apps such as Signal, WhatsApp and Telegram, we urge
you to immediately enable a security PIN or password for your account.

We identified a single Circles system in Australia. We cannot verify the identity of the
operator. The system’s Check Point firewall was also reachable through an IP address in a
Malaysian datacenter (EstNOC Malaysia), which appears to be forwarding traffic onwards to
the Australian IPs. The Australian IPs, on Optus and TPG, geolocate to Australia’s capital
Canberra, per MaxMind.

believe that “HOK” is a reference to the Danish “Army Operational Command,” which was
restructured in 2014 and is now apparently known as the Danish “Army Command.”

Malaysia
We identified one Circles system in Malaysia, named Pixcell Mazda Farmer. We cannot
verify the identity of the operator. We believe Pixcell is a reference to a Circles device, whose
description in United States Federal Communication Commission (FCC) and United States
Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) documents suggests it is a portable IMSI catcher.
While the Pixcell model that underwent the FCC approval process apparently starting in
October 2016 has WCDMA (3G) support, a January 2017 photograph of the Pixcell model
submitted to the USPTO appears to indicate that WCDMA support was removed, and
support for LTE (4G) was added, based on the absence of a “WCDMA” status light, and an
“LTE” status light in its place.

We found names for several other Circles systems appearing in IP ranges registered to
Circles. Because these names were never recorded in IP ranges that might belong to Circles
customers, we are unsure of their identity. The names were: GTR Whitehippo, Icarus
Shemer, Kodik Kite, and Opel Oranit.
1. Check Point is aware that its firewalls publicly produce this hostname information, and
does not consider this to be a security issue, remarking that this is “public
information.”↩
2. We found a total of 19 distinct TLS certificates ever recorded as matching this regular
expression, returned by a total of 57 IP addresses. Ultimately, our search for TLS
certificates containing this regular expression did not help us identify any additional
Circles systems, though it did help us tie IP addresses together as belonging to the
same system, based on returning the same TLS certificate.↩
