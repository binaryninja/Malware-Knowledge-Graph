North Korean hackers are skimming US and
European shoppers

6th July 2020 / Web Skimming / Sansec Threat Research Team

North Korean state sponsored hackers are implicated in the interception of online payments from
American and European shoppers, Sansec research shows. Hackers associated with the APT
Lazarus/HIDDEN COBRA1 group were found to be breaking into online stores of large US retailers and
planting payment skimmers as early as May 2019.
Previously, North Korean hacking activity was mostly restricted to banks and South Korean crypto markets2,
covert cyber operations that earned hackers $2 billion, according to a 2019 United Nations report3. As Sansec’s
new research shows, they have now extended their portfolio with the profitable crime of digital skimming.
Sansec researchers have attributed the activity to HIDDEN COBRA because infrastructure from previous
operations was reused. Furthermore, distinctive patterns in the malware code were identified that linked
multiple hacks to the same actor.

HIDDEN COBRA & digital skimming
Digital skimming, also known as Magecart4, is the interception of credit cards during online store purchases.
This type of fraud has been growing since 2015 and was traditionally dominated by Russian-5 and Indonesianspeaking6 hacker groups. This is no longer the case, as the incumbent criminals now face competition from
their North Korean counterparts.
In order to intercept transactions, an attacker needs to modify the computer code that runs an online store.
HIDDEN COBRA managed to gain access to the store code of large retailers such as international fashion chain
Claire’s7. How HIDDEN COBRA got access is yet unknown, but attackers often use spearphishing attacks
(booby-trapped emails) to obtain the passwords of retail staff.
Using the unauthorized access, HIDDEN COBRA injects its malicious script into the store checkout page. The
skimmer waits for keystrokes of unsuspecting customers. Once a customer completes the transaction, the
intercepted data - such as credit card numbers - are sent to a HIDDEN COBRA-controlled collection server.

Italian model agency as money mule
Curiously, HIDDEN COBRA used the sites of an Italian modeling agency and a vintage music store from Tehran
to run its global skimming campaign.

To monetize the skimming operations, HIDDEN COBRA developed a global exfiltration network. This network
utilizes legitimate sites, that got hijacked and repurposed to serve as disguise for the criminal activity. The
network is also used to funnel the stolen assets so they can be sold on dark web markets. Sansec has identified
a number of these exfiltration nodes, which include a modeling agency8 from Milan, a vintage music store9
from Tehran and a family run book store10 from New Jersey.

Technical analysis
Sansec monitors millions of online stores for skimming activity and typically finds 30 to 100 infected stores per
day. Many cases have a common modus operandi, such as shared infrastructure or striking features in
programming style. These traits can be obvious, such as the debug message “Success bro” that led to the
arrest of three Indonesians in December6. However, sometimes they are more subtle, as is the case with
HIDDEN COBRA.

Sansec research has identified multiple, independent links between recent skimming activity and previously
documented North Korean hacking operations The following diagram shows (a small subset of) victim stores

documented North Korean hacking operations. The following diagram shows (a small subset of) victim stores
in green and HIDDEN COBRA controlled exfiltration nodes in red. Yellow indicates a uniquely identifying modus
operandi (or TTP), which will be discussed next.

The first campaign: clienToken=

<script src="https://www.luxmodelagency.com/wp-includes/js/customize-gtag.min.js"></script>

On June 23rd, 2019, Sansec discovered a skimmer on a US truck parts store that uses a compromised Italian
modeling site11 to harvest payment data. The injected script customize-gtag.min.js 12 is scrambled with a
popular Javascript obfuscator13. Hidden in the code, the string WTJ4cFpXNTBWRzlyWlc0OQ== is found, which is
the double-base64 encoded representation of clientToken= . This particular keyword is later used as HTTP
GET parameter to send the stolen payload to the collector exfiltration node. The specific encoding and the
attempt to disguise the stolen payload as “clientToken” form a uniquely identifying characteristic.

The malware was removed within 24 hours but a week later, the very same malware resurfaced on the same
store. This time, it used a New Jersey book store to harvest credit cards14:

<script src="https://www.signedbooksandcollectibles.com/js/gmaps.min.js"></script>

During the following months, Sansec discovered the same malware on several dozen stores. Each time, it uses
one of these hijacked sites as loader and card collector:

stefanoturco.com (between 2019-07-19 and 2019-08-10)
technokain.com (between 2019-07-06 and 2019-07-09)
darvishkhan.net (between 2019-05-30 and 2019-11-26)
areac-agr.com (between 2019-05-30 and 2020-05-01)
luxmodelagency.com (between 2019-06-23 and 2020-04-07)
signedbooksandcollectibles.com (between 2019-07-01 and 2020-05-24)

The second campaign: __preloader
In February and March 2020, several domain names were registrered that closely resemble popular consumer
brands:

2020-02-10 PAPERS0URCE.COM
2020-02-26 FOCUSCAMERE.COM
2020-03-21 CLAIRES-ASSETS.COM

Subsequently, Sansec found the web stores of the three corresponding brands compromised with payment
skimming malware installed The anonymously registered domains were used as loader and card collector15

skimming malware installed. The anonymously registered domains were used as loader and card collector15.
The three malware cases not only share infrastructure (domain registrar & DNS service), but they also share a
particularly odd code snippet, that Sansec has not observed anywhere else. The three relevant malware
segments are displayed below for reference. Common behavior: upon form submission a hidden, dynamic
image is added to the page with the deceptive name __preloader . The image address is controlled by the
attacker, and the intercepted and encoded payload is sent as argument to this image, along with several random
numbers. Immediately, the dynamic image is removed from the page, so the theft is invisible to the customer.
Sansec has previously discussed this exfiltration method when it first reported on the Claire’s hack on June
15th7.

(code slightly modified for readability)
The common code, behavior, registrar and DNS server are unique traits that link these cases to the same
source.

The North Korean link
As the diagram above shows, Sansec has established multiple, independent links to previously documented
North Korean hacking activity. We will discuss each link separately.

technokain.com
South Korea based EST Security has published two articles16 17 documenting a North Korea-attributed attack
where a malicious loader is embedded in Korean office documents. The loader installs remote access software
for Windows on the victim’s computer, which is downloaded from this address:

2019-07-12 https://technokain.com/ads/adshow1.dat

Additionally, US-based security firm Rewterz reported a spearphishing attack targeting attendees of the annual
Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas18. This attack uses malware from the same address.
These attacks took place on July 11 and 12th, less than a week after the placement of a skimmer on the same
site:

2019-07-06 https://technokain.com/vendor/jquery.validate.min.js

darvishkhan.net

Both Fortiguard Labs19 and EST Security20 document a DPRK-attributed spearphishing campaign that took
place between June 26th and July 2nd 2019 The campaign used malicious Korean office documents

place between June 26th and July 2nd 2019. The campaign used malicious Korean office documents
containing malware installers, where remote access software was downloaded from:

2019-06-27 https://darvishkhan.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/update6.dat

Two weeks earlier, multiple digital skimmers were launched from the same site, harvesting credit cards from
several US, UK and Australia-based stores:

2019-06-12 https://darvishkhan.net/wp-includes/js/hotjar.min.js
2019-06-14 https://darvishkhan.net/wp-includes/js/dist/gtm.min.js

areac-agr.com
On October 25, Beijing-based Netlab360 discovered a novel remote access trojan (RAT) that showed multiple
similarities with previously DPRK attributed malware21. Components of the tool were loaded from

2019-10-25 http://www.areac-agr.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/check.vm

Before and after the presence of this malware, digital skimmers were hosted on the same site, that would
intercept payments from multiple American stores:

2019-08-16 https://www.areac-agr.com/cms/wp-includes/Requests/Security1.3.min.js
2020-05-01 https://www.areac-agr.com/cms/wp-includes/Requests/Utility/json.min.js

papers0urce.com
The three malware domains from the __preloader campaign use distinct IPs. One of them - papers0urce.com
- uses an address from Dutch ISP Leaseweb, 23.81.246.179 . This IP is not known to have been used for other
domain names since 201522, however, it is featured in the same North Korea research as the previously
discussed areac-agr.com 21. The IP is hardcoded in the RAT, and used as a command and control (C2) server.

Discussion
Does the usage of common loader sites, and the similarity in time frame, prove that the DPRK-attributed
operations are run by the same actor as the skimming operations? Theoretically, it is possible that different
nefarious actors had simultaneous control over the same set of hijacked sites, but in practice, this would be
extremely unlikely. First, thousands of sites get hacked each day23, making an overlap highly coincidental.
Secondly, when a site gets hacked, it is common practice for a perpetrator to close the exploited vulnerability
after gaining access, in order to shield the new asset from competitors.

Sansec has found proof of global skimming activity that has multiple, independent links to previously
documented, North Korea attributed hacking operations. Sansec believes that North Korean state sponsored
actors have engaged in large scale digital skimming activity since at least May 2019.
