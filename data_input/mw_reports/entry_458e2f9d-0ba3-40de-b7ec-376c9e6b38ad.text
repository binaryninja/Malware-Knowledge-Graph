Yesterday, the company behind the gaming blockbuster Cyberpunk 2077 announced that it
had been hit by a ransomware attack and the hackers claimed to have stolen source code
for upcoming games. The most likely culprit at this time of the known ransomware groups is
a group known as HelloKitty.
Below we have taken a look at previous HelloKitty attacks, and found a trail of victims.
Previous attacks include potentially dangerous code to kill applications, including Industrial
Control Systems. We also found links to earlier notable ransomware attacks.
Background
Yesterday CD Projekt Red revealed they had fallen victim to a ransomware attack:

1/11

“”An unidentified actor gained unauthorized access to our internal network, collected certain
data belonging to CD PROJEKT capital group, and left a ransom note the content of which
we release to the public.”
They join a number of other gaming companies to have recently suffered the same fate.

The ransomware note shared by CD Projekt Red
The Emsisoft CTO has suggested this may be the work of HelloKitty ransomware. That is
based on the ransomware note and rare filename, and they caveat that it’s not possible to be
sure without seeing the ransomware itself. We’d concur with that caution. Whilst the notes
are certainly familiar (as shown below) – they are custom for most victims and not an exact
match. As an anti-virus with a track record of ransomware analysis, it’s likely Emsisoft has
seen samples of HelloKitty that we have not and have included that in their assessment.
With those caveats in hand – we took a look at previous HelloKitty attacks below.
Most Recent Attacks
The most recent attack we’ve seen from HelloKitty targeted a UK Healthcare organisation at
the end of January 2021. Below is the ransomware note, with the name of the targeted
organisation redacted:

2/11

It goes without saying that it is particularly irresponsible to be deploying targeted
ransomware to organisations that provide key medical services during a global pandemic.
Christmas 2020 Attacks
Attackers are well aware of the importance timing can make to the impact of their attacks.
Notably, Russian attackers successfully disabled Ukranian power networks for two
consecutive Christmas Eve’s. The timing both left thousands of families without power on
Christmas day, and only a skeleton crew at the power company to respond.
We’re aware of at least two, and likely more, attacks that HelloKitty delivered on Christmas
Day 2020. They likely had access for some time before, but chose to deploy their
ransomware on Christmas day for maximum impact.
The first has previously been reported on. At Christmas 2020 the Brazilian powerplant
operator CEMIG disclosed on Facebook that they had fallen victim to a ransomware attack:
“CEMIG informs that on December 25, 2020, the SOC (security operation nucleus) detected
anomalous behavior on the internal network, with characteristics of a malicious ransomware
attack. The teams responsible for the correct detection of the attack and subsequent
adoption of the containment measures were immediately activated.
Less than 10% of servers on the Windows / Microsoft Hyper-V platform had their content
encrypted. Workstations have also been partially compromised and are in the process of
being verified. It is important to highlight that, thanks to the fast and effective containment
action carried out by Cemig, the operation of the electrical system and the main databases
(customers, billing, customer service and business management) were not compromised,
thus guaranteeing the provision of services to our clients.”
3/11

The statement about the Hyper-V platform matches the ransomware note we’ve seen linked
to the attack:

The CEMIG Ransomware note
Reportedly, CEMIG had restored their system within four days.
As normal with targeted ransomware, the attackers provided a chat link for CEMIG. The
conversation was captured by the site ID Ransomware (RU). Based on the conversation, we
think it is unlikely that CEMIG* decided to pay the ransom:

4/11

* Other analysts have pointed out that given the payment link was made public, this may not
be CEMIG communicating with Hello Kitty.
But CEMIG was not the only target at Christmas. We’ve seen another HelloKitty ransomware
note from a different target that was uploaded to the site VirusTotal.com on Christmas day
2020:

5/11

The ransom note to a French IT service (we have redacted the name)
Application Termination
One sample of HelloKitty, compiled on 26th December 2020, contains a large list of
applications to terminate:

6/11

We were disturbed to see terminated applications included Industrial Control System
software such as GE Proficy and Honeywell HMIWeb. Investigating this list, it appears it is
copied from the MegaCortex/Ekans/Snake ransomware.
When the MegaCortex list was first identified it generated significant concern about the
impact it could have on SCADA systems. However, more day to day applications such as
backup software and accounting software are also terminated. As researchers noted at the
time – the attackers seem concerned with stopping any software that may limit its impact,
rather than specifically targeting SCADA.
Nonetheless it is concerning to see such careless code in a sample of malware, which was
compiled at the same time that a Powerplant operator was enduring their attack.
Links to Earlier Campaigns
We quickly found links to the “TechStrat” ransomware identified in October 2020. The
ransomware note is named the same (“read_me_lkdtt.txt”) as many HelloKitty ransomware
notes. And the note itself is very similar to the note that was deployed to CEMIG:

7/11

Decompiling the code of a sample, shows it to also be extremely similar to other HelloKitty
samples. It also contains the code to kill a range of applications that was borrowed from
MegaCortex.
In addition, we (and others 1, 2) spotted possible overlaps with an earlier family called
“DeathRansom”. A quick review is shown from Intezer’s analysis and Antivirus vendors often
detecting both HelloKitty ransomware binaries and notes as DeathRansom:

If so, that may be particularly interesting given that Fortinet tracked down the DeathRansom
author in an involved blog post in January 2020.
Additionally, Emsisoft caveat here:
“Some analysts may refer to HelloKitty as DeathRansom, a strain of malware that was
originally only capable of renaming files. Different versions of DeathRansom were later
developed that could encrypt files in various ways. However, the relationship between
DeathRansom and HelloKitty is still not fully clear.”
In Closing
It’s clear that HelloKitty is yet another set of targeted ransomware operators that have moved
to threaten their victims with impact going beyond the immediate destruction of data. If they
are indeed linked to the earlier DeathRansom attacks, they have improved significantly from
their initial forays into ransomware. The first version didn’t even encrypt anything. We have
provided some suggested mitigation strategies below.
Mitigation

8/11

We have included a number of mitigation strategies that Cado Security recommends both for
HelloKitty and ransomware in general:
Consider utilising separate IT systems (privileged access workstations) for used by
network and system administrators. For these systems, utilise additional two-factor
authentication and ensure there is no direct access to the Internet.
Consider employing an “allowed list” to restrict server outbound communications to IP’s
/ Domains that they need access to.
Consider storing backups of key business and critical IT infrastructure systems e.g.
ActiveDirectory, off of your network.
Avoid opening up RDP services to the internet, if it’s required consider using an
ALLOW LIST approach only, and DENY all unknown IPs by default.
Ensure you have the ability to restore to a segregated network environment.
Ensure you have tested the restore capabilities of your backups.
Both the UK NCSC and ICS-CERT provide more extended mitigations for destructive
attacks.
