The operators of the TrickBot malware botnet have shut down their server infrastructure
today after months of inactivity, bringing to an end one of the most dangerous and persistent
malware operations seen in recent years.
Prior to today‚Äôs voluntary shutdown, the TrickBot gang hadn‚Äôt set up new servers or tried to
carry out email spam campaigns since mid-December 2021.
But today‚Äôs shutdown comes as no surprise, Vitali Kremez, CEO of security firm AdvIntel,
told The Record in a phone call earlier today.
It comes after the group‚Äôs malware has become ‚Äúhighly detectable‚Äù by security products,
which appears to have damaged the group‚Äôs ability to infect and then sell access to Windows
systems to its criminal clientele, security firms AdvIntel and Intel471 wrote in separate
reports analyzing the malware‚Äôs recent slump.
‚ÄúTrickbot, after all, is relatively old malware that hasn‚Äôt been updated in a major way.
Detection rates are high, and the network traffic from bot communication is easily
recognized,‚Äù Intel471 said earlier today before Kremez confirmed that TrickBot had decided
to call it quits.

Kremez also cited recent recruitment from the Conti ransomware gang as a primary factor in
TrickBot‚Äôs recent demise.
After resurrecting and integrating the Emotet botnet into its ‚Äúcybercrime cartel‚Äù towards the
end of 2021, Kremez said that the Conti gang has now also recruited several top members of
the TrickBot gang as well.
Under its new leadership, the old TrickBot malware codebase and infrastructure appears to
have been abandoned, and Kremez said that the Conti gang is working with the former
TrickBot devs to further develop and deploy BazaarBackdoor, one of TrickBot‚Äôs former
modules, as a replacement for TrickBot itself.

TrickBot goes out on its own terms
The TrickBot gang fading its old malware and morphing into a new operation cames after
both US authorities and security firms have tried to forcibly take down its command and
control server infrastructure in October 2020.
Despite losing roughly 94% of its servers, the botnet survived and returned with new servers
days later and with new attacks after a few weeks.
But the failed takedown attempt didn‚Äôt dissuade US authorities and they responded in 2021
by charging and detaining two of TrickBot‚Äôs programmers, Alla Witte and Vladimir Dunaev.
However, the arrests didn‚Äôt touch the group‚Äôs leadership, which remained intact, and
continued to operate the botnet throughout 2021 before entering their recent Conti
collaboration and moving on to a new malware codebase.
In December 2021, just days before TrickBot ceased operations, Check Point reported
seeing the malware on more than 140,000 systems throughout the year (2021).
In a Wired feature on TrickBot, security firm Hold Security said saw the TrickBot gang
invested more than $20 million in its infrastructure last year, which shows the scale of its
operation, which dwarfs many legitimate software firms today.
