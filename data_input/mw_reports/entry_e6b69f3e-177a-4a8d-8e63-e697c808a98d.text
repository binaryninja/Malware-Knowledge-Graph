2011 Internet Crime Report

Executive Summary
In 2011, the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) actively pursued its mission to address crimes committed using
the Internet, providing services to both victims of online crimes and to law enforcement. Statistics in this report reveal
IC3’s success. IC3 marked the third year in a row that it received over 300,000 complaints, a 3.4-percent increase over
the previous year. The adjusted dollar loss of complaints was $485.3 million.1
The 2011 IC3 Internet Crime Report reveals both the scope of online crime and IC3’s battle against it. The most common
victim complaints included FBI-related scams, identity theft and advance fee fraud.2 IC3 received and processed more than
26,000 complaints per month. Based on victim complaints, the top five states were California
(34,169), Florida (20,034),
336,655
Texas (18,477), New York (15,056) and Ohio (12,661). Victims in California reported the highest dollar losses with a total
of $70.5 million. For victims reporting financial losses, the average was $4,187.
314,246

IC3 serves as a powerful conduit for law enforcement to share information and pursue cases that often span jurisdictional
boundaries. Collaboration within this partnership has produced a number of technological advancements to streamline
how the public’s complaints are processed and referred to investigators. Initially established as simply a convenient
method for citizens to report Internet crime information, IC3 has evolved into a vital resource for both victims of
online crime and for law enforcement across the country that investigate and prosecute a wide range of cases.

Methodology of evaluating loss amounts: FBI IC3 Unit staff reviewed for validity all complaints that reported a loss of more than $100,000. Analysts also converted losses reported
in foreign currencies to dollars. The final amounts of all reported losses above $100,000 for which the complaint information did not support the loss amount were excluded from
the statistics.

Complaint category statistics that are based on the perceptions of the complaints are not typically accurate for statistical purposes. The statistics pulled from the complaints
themselves, however, are considerably more accurate as they are categorized and grouped through the IC3 automated system. IC3 does not verify complaint data.

IC3 started in May 2000.

IC3 Overview
The Internet Fraud Complaint Center — a partnership
between NW3C, BJA and the FBI — was established
May 8, 2000 to address the ever-increasing incidence
of online fraud. Just three years later, in response to
the exponential increase in cyber crime of all types,
the center changed its name to the Internet Crime
Complaint Center (IC3®). Today, IC3 accepts more
complaints in a single month than it received in its first
six months. With more than two million complaints
received since its inception, IC3 serves as the nation’s
portal for reporting Internet crime and suspicious
activity. IC3’s success has attracted international interest,
with Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany using
IC3 as a model for similar cyber crime centers.

Lifecycle of a Complaint
Victims file complaints with IC3, some of which are
auto-referred to appropriate law enforcement, while all
go into the expansive bank of Internet crime complaints
that make up the IC3 database.

While developing a case, Internet crime analysts
compile similar complaints, collect relevant case
information from both open- and closed-source
public information databases and confer with state,
local, tribal, federal and international law enforcement
personnel. Of all the complaints received in 2011,
only 36.9 percent (115,903) reported financial
loss. Although IC3 may not immediately build all
complaints into referrals, all complaints are helpful
in identifying trends and building statistical reports.
IC3 compiles this information into reports that are
available to all law enforcement through direct emails
and placement on www.ic3.gov. It also develops public
awareness documents. IC3 encourages victims of
Internet crime to report all incidents to IC3 – whether or
not an actual dollar loss is involved – due to the broad
dissemination and varied uses of the data gathered from
the complaints.

During 2011, FBI-related scams were the most reported
offense, followed by identity theft and advance fee fraud.
IC3 primarily refers complaints with claims of dollar
losses. Other complaints, which may represent a
comparatively large percentage of complaints received,
do not contain dollar loss claims, but are intended
only to alert IC3 of the scam.
Complaint category statistics may not always produce
an accurate picture. They are based on complainant
perception. However, the Complaint Management

FBI-related Scams – Scams in which a criminal
poses as the FBI to defraud victims.

•

Identity Theft – Unauthorized use of a victim’s
personal identifying information to commit fraud
or other crimes.

•

Advance Fee Fraud – Criminals convince victims
to pay a fee to receive something of value, but do
not deliver anything of value to the victim.

•

Non-Auction/Non-Delivery of Merchandise –
Purchaser does not receive items purchased.

•

Overpayment Fraud – An incident in which
the complainant receives an invalid monetary
instrument with instructions to deposit it in a bank
account and send excess funds or a percentage of
the deposited money back to the sender.

payment service and to fax their payment receipt to
the seller as proof of payment. The criminal pockets
the payment but does not deliver the vehicle.

In fraudulent vehicle sales, criminals attempt to
sell vehicles they do not own. Criminals create an
attractive deal by advertising vehicles for sale at prices
below book value. Often the sellers claim they must
sell the vehicle because they are moving for work or
being deployed for the military. Because of the alleged
pending move, criminals refuse to meet in person or
allow inspection of the vehicle, and they often attempt
to rush the sale. To make the deal appear legitimate,
the criminal instructs the victim to send full or partial

Victims of these scams reported losses exceeding $8.2
million in 2011. With an average reported loss of more
than $2,000, more than $22,700 per day was lost to these
frauds, or $946.13 every hour. IC3 received a complaint
of this variety approximately every two hours.

Romance Scams
also use stories of severe life circumstances, tragedies,
family deaths, personal injuries or other hardships to
keep their victims concerned and involved in their
schemes. They also ask victims to send money to help
overcome alleged financial hardships.

In 2011, IC3 received over 5,600 complaints of romance
scams in which scammers target individuals who
search for companionship or romance online. Victims
believe they are “dating” someone decent and honest.
However, the online contact is often a criminal with
a well-rehearsed script that scammers use repeatedly
and successfully. Scammers search chat rooms, dating
sites, and social networking sites looking for victims.
Although the principal group of victims is over 40 years
old, divorced or widowed, disabled and often elderly,
all demographics are at risk.

These scams not only take a high toll on victims
emotionally, but monetarily as well. In 2011, victim
reported losses to various romance scams totaled $50.4
million. On average, each victim reported a loss of
$8,900. At a rate of 15 complaints received per day, these
scams saw daily reported losses of roughly $138,000, or
more than $5,700 every hour.

Scammers use poetry, flowers and other gifts to reel in
victims, while declaring “undying love.” These criminals

Work-from-Home Scams
Consumers continue to lose money from work-fromhome scams that cyber criminals use to move stolen
funds. Regrettably, due to their participation, these
individuals may face criminal charges. Organized cyber
criminals recruit their victims through newspaper
ads, online employment services, unsolicited emails or
“spam,” and social networking sites advertising workfrom-home “opportunities.”
Participating with a legitimate business, the consumer
becomes a “mule” for criminals who use the consumer’s

or other victim’s accounts to steal and launder money.
In addition, the scammers may compromise the victim’s
own identity or accounts.
Employment scams reported to IC3 in 2011 showed
losses exceeding $20 million. Complaints from victims
of these scams averaged two per hour in 2011. With
an average reported loss of $1,160 per complaint,
victims of employment scams reported losing more
than $55,000 per day ($2,297 per hour).

Internet Crime Complaint Center

Loan Intimidation Scams
relay that they had completed online applications for
other loans or credit cards before the calls began.

IC3 receives a high volume of complaints from victims
of payday loan telephone collection scams. In these
scams, a caller claims that the victim is delinquent in
a payday loan and must repay the loan to avoid legal
consequences. The callers purport to be representatives
of the FBI, Federal Legislative Department, various
law firms or other legitimate-sounding agencies. They
claim to be collecting debts for various companies.

The fraudsters relentlessly call the victims’ homes,
cell phones and places of employment. They refuse to
provide the victims any details of the alleged payday
loans and become abusive when questioned. The
callers threaten victims with legal actions, arrests, and
in some cases physical violence if they refuse to pay.
In many cases, the callers even resort to harassment of
the victims’ relatives, friends and employers.

One of the most insidious aspects of this scam is that
the callers have accurate information about the victims,
including Social Security numbers, dates of birth,
addresses, employer information, bank account numbers,
and names and telephone numbers of relatives and
friends. The method by which the fraudsters obtained
the personal information is unclear, but victims often

In 2011, reported losses for victims of loan intimidation
scams exceeded $8 million. At the rate of 27 complaints
received per day, these scams resulted in reported losses
of $934 per hour, or more than $22,000 per day.

Internet Crime Complaint Center

Case Highlights
Attorney Collection Scam
In July 2007, IC3 began receiving complaints from
U.S. law firms that subject(s) contacted them via email
requesting assistance with third party debt collection.
The victims received checks from the alleged debtor
along with instructions to wire transfer the collected
funds minus attorney fees. In most instances, the funds
were wired to banks in Korea, China, Ireland and
Canada. In all instances the checks were counterfeit.

This company sells non-prescription dietary aids,
nutritional supplements and other products online. The
Attorney General’s Economic Crimes Division began
its investigation in December 2009 after consumers
complained of receiving and being billed for products
they did not order. An investigation revealed that
acceptance of a trial product offer triggered a negative
option agreement, which imposed automatic monthly
shipments and re-occurring costs associated with
receiving the trial products.

In a twist on this scam, the criminals purported to be

The fraudulent company sent threatening emails
to operators of adult websites claiming that child
pornography was found on their websites. IC3 analysts
learned that the group’s website was fraudulently
registered under the name of a U.S. congresswoman.
Ultimately the domain name was transferred to the
legitimate organization, ending the operation of the
spoofed site.
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack by Teen
IC3, working via the Internet Crime Working Group
(ICWG), investigated a case that pertained to Distributed
Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks by an individual who
went by “phr34k1sh” and “verbal vampire.” A DDoS

a wide-scale, international “work-at-home” scam
operated out of Lagos, Nigeria. The defendant was
directed to accept packages, sell the contents, retain
20 percent of proceeds and then wire the remaining
funds to unknown suspects in Nigeria, according to
Long Beach Police Detective Greg McMullen. The
victims posted their resumes or ads online seeking job
opportunities, Detective McMullen explained. The
defendant in this case was charged with grand theft,
possession of stolen property and parole violations.

Internet Crime Complaint Center

Scam Alerts
Victims’ complaints are
a vital resource for IC3,
law enforcement agencies
and industry partners. IC3
uses all complaint data it
receives to prepare public
service
announcements
(PSAs) on the latest cyber
trends to keep consumers
and industry up-to-date
on Internet fraud. IC3
distributes these PSAs
through media outlets,
corporate partners and
www.ic3.gov.
Below
are some of the alerts
distributed in 2011 (see
Appendix II).
Traffic Ticket Spam

Prevention Tips
Consumers who exercise diligence when
conducting business online often avoid becoming
victims. (Additional prevention tips can be found in
Appendix I.)
• Be cautious when dealing with individuals
outside of your own country.
• Be wary if the seller only accepts wire transfers
or cash, or if the business operates from P.O.
boxes or maildrops.
• Beware when money is required up front for
instructions or products.
• Monitor your credit statements monthly for any
fraudulent activity and review a copy of your
credit report at least once a year.
• Do not open spam. Delete it unread. Never
respond to spam as this will confirm to the
sender that it is a “live” email address.

IC3 received more than 70
complaints between July
and October 2011 about
fraudulent emails claiming the recipients had been issued
traffic tickets. The spam, which spoofed a nyc.gov email
address, claimed to be from the New York State Police
(NYSP). The email instructed victims to print the ticket
and mail it to a town court in Chatham Hall.

NYSP is investigating this matter with assistance from
the FBI Albany Division. Initial analysis indicated the
email campaign is associated with a Russian domain.
Some emails included malware associated with bogus
anti-virus software.
Fraudster ‘Double-Dipping’
In an Internet fraud involving autos, a scammer posts
a nonexistent vehicle for sale on the Internet. Often the
description and photos of the vehicle are lifted from
legitimate websites. A buyer responds and is told that the
vehicle is located overseas. The fraudster then instructs
the victim to send a deposit via wire transfer to initiate
the shipping process.
In a recent twist to this scam, the criminal advised there
was a problem with the initial wire transfer and sent the
victim a cashier’s check. The victim was instructed to
cash the check and send a second wire to a different

account. Unaware the
check was counterfeit,
the victim followed the
fraudster’s instructions.
The victim was duped
twice, and the fraudster
successfully executed his
“double-dipping” strategy.
Radio Ad Seeks Mystery
Shoppers
Some retailers hire marketing
research companies to
evaluate their quality of
service. These research
companies, in turn, use
mystery shoppers to make
purchases in stores or
restaurants and then report
on the experience.

Another
version
of
mystery shopping involves
consumers “hired” to evaluate the speed and efficiency
of a specified money transfer service. The shopper
receives a check with instructions to deposit it in a
personal bank account, withdraw the amount in cash
and wire it to a third party. After wiring the cash to
a third party, the victim learns that the check was
counterfeit. To appear credible, scammers advertise
such opportunities on reputable websites, television
stations and in publications. In reality, media outlets are
unable to verify the legitimacy of the job opportunity.
Recently, IC3 received information from radio stations
in Los Angeles and Palm Springs, California reporting
that they had been contacted via email by an individual
wanting to purchase ads to promote a mystery shopper
program. The stations received signed confirmations
and credit card payments, which cleared. The stations
ran the ads and then received complaints from listeners
who were scammed. Listeners received a check and
were instructed to cash it immediately. After deducting
$450 for their commission, they were told to wire the
difference to a third party. Later, the check was identified
as counterfeit. In addition, the credit card used to pay
for the ads had been compromised.

2011 Internet Crime Report | 19

Bogus Lawsuits Promise Mortgage Relief
IC3 received several complaints from people who received
a letter stating they were a potential plaintiff in a “mass
joinder” lawsuit filed against their mortgage companies.
The law firm made a variety of claims and sales pitches
for legal and litigation services, asking consumers to pay
non-refundable, upfront fees of $2,000 to $5,000. Its goal,
however, was taking money, not providing a service.
Lawyers seeking plaintiffs to join a class action lawsuit
do not seek an up-front commission.
The California Department of Real Estate and the Better
Business Bureau posted online warnings about this scam.

Protecting the Public
Over the past decade, Internet fraud has become one of
the fastest-growing crime concerns facing the public.
Nearly all crime that once was committed in person,
by mail or over the telephone can now be committed
through the Internet. IC3 serves as a convenient and
easy way for victims of Internet crime to alert authorities
to a suspected violation.
IC3 also understands how important it is to inform the

public about the dangers of cyber crime. Because all
age groups are potentially at risk, IC3 is dedicated to
providing educational services to both children and
adults. IC3 annually visits schools and community
organizations to help ensure the public knows how to
stay safe while online.
Through a partnership with the U.S. Postal Inspection
Service and other businesses and organizations, IC3
operates the website www.lookstoogoodtobetrue.com,
which provides information on the latest schemes
and gives victims the opportunity to share their
experiences online.

Conclusion
The 2011 IC3 Internet Crime Report provides a snapshot
of the variety of crimes perpetrated online. The report
details IC3’s efforts to prevent and reduce crime and
assist law enforcement.
In 2011, IC3 processed over 300,000 complaints,
representing dollar losses approaching a half-billion.
IC3 referred complaints to local, state, federal and
international law enforcement agencies, providing
additional analysis to assist investigations, when
relevant. As the case highlights and statistics in this
year’s report show, IC3’s efforts led to the arrests and
convictions of many cyber criminals. IC3 also produced
trend analysis reports, public service announcements,
scam alerts and other publications to alert both law
enforcement and the general public.
IC3 will continue to enhance its services and products
to keep up with technology and trends in the ongoing
war against cyber crime.

probably is.

Be leery if the individual states that his country
will not allow direct business shipments from the
United States.

•

•

It is a violation of federal law to play a foreign
lottery via mail or phone.

Be wary if the ship-to address is yours but the name
on the package is not.

•

Do not accept packages you did not order.

•

If you receive packages you did not order, either
refuse delivery or contact the company that sent the
package.

Phishing/Spoofing
•

Be suspicious of any unsolicited email requesting
personal information.
