Two cybersecurity firms with a strong business presence in Ukraine—ESET and Broadcom’s
Symantec—have reported tonight that computer networks in the country have been hit with a
new data-wiping attack.
The attack is taking place as Russian military troops have crossed the border and invaded
Ukraine’s territory in what Russian President Putin has described as a “peacekeeping”
mission.
Details about the attack are still being collected, and the attack is still going on. It’s scale and
the number of impacted systems is still unknown.

Breaking. #ESETResearch discovered a new data wiper malware used in Ukraine
today. ESET telemetry shows that it was installed on hundreds of machines in the
country. This follows the DDoS attacks against several Ukrainian websites earlier today

Today’s event marks the second time this year that a data wiper was deployed on Ukrainian
computer systems after a first attack took place in mid-January.
The deployment of that first malware (named WhisperGate) was hidden under the guise of a
fake ransomware outbreak and during a series of coordinated defacements of Ukrainian
government websites.
Similarly, today’s data-wiping attacks were also accompanied by a series of distributed denial
of service (DDoS) attacks against government websites, in a similar attempt to distract
government IT workers and the public’s attention.
“Targets have included finance and government contractors,” Vikram Thakur, Technical
Director at Symantec Threat Intelligence, a division of Broadcom Software, told The Record
in an email. Infections were reported from Ukraine, but some systems were also hit across
Latvia and Lithuania.

Malware corrupts data, rewrites the MBR
At the time of writing, Ukrainian government officials have not confirmed or released any
details about the ongoing attack.
However, according to a technical analysis of the malware, which ESET said it was tracking
as HermeticWiper, the wiper is sometimes deployed via Windows group policies,
suggesting the attackers may have full control of some of their target’s internal networks.
Once deployed, the wiper runs a version of the EaseUS Partition Master software, a disk
partitioning utility, which it uses to corrupt local data and then reboot the computer.
According to Silas Cutler, a security researcher for Stairwell, HermeticWiper doesn’t just
destroy local data, but it also damages the master boot record (MBR) section of a hard drive,
which prevents the computer from booting into the operating system after the forced reboot
—behavior identical with the WhisperGate wiper attack from last month.
I can confirm this damages a systems MBR. https://t.co/68B0V743lR

ESET said today’s attack was first seen around 16:52, Ukraine time. According to security
researcher MalwareHunterTeam, the malware appears to have been compiled just five hours
before it was deployed in the wild, suggesting its code and operational infrastructure was
most likely set up and ready to go well in advance.
Article updated at 4am ET with new name for the malware and to add that Russia has
formally declared war on Ukraine hours after this piece of malware was deployed, confirming
theories that HermeticWiper’s primary role was to cripple local IT systems and prevent the
Ukrainian government from reacting with its full capabilities. Almost 18 hours after it was
deployed, it remains unclear if the malware succeeded.
