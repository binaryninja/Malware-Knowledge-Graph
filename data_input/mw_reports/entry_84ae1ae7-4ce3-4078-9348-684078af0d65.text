A federal indictment unsealed today charges three North Korean computer programmers
with participating in a wide-ranging criminal conspiracy to conduct a series of destructive
cyberattacks, to steal and extort more than $1.3 billion of money and cryptocurrency from
financial institutions and companies, to create and deploy multiple malicious cryptocurrency
applications, and to develop and fraudulently market a blockchain platform.

A second case unsealed today revealed that a Canadian-American citizen has agreed to
plead guilty in a money laundering scheme and admitted to being a high-level money
launderer for multiple criminal schemes, including ATM “cash-out” operations and a cyberenabled bank heist orchestrated by North Korean hackers.
“As laid out in today’s indictment, North Korea’s operatives, using keyboards rather than
guns, stealing digital wallets of cryptocurrency instead of sacks of cash, are the world’s
leading bank robbers,” said Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers of the Justice
Department’s National Security Division. “The Department will continue to confront malicious
nation state cyber activity with our unique tools and work with our fellow agencies and the
family of norms abiding nations to do the same.”
“Today's unsealed indictment expands upon the FBI’s 2018 charges for the unprecedented
cyberattacks conducted by the North Korean regime,” said the FBI Deputy Director Paul
Abbate. “The ongoing targeting, compromise, and cyber-enabled theft by North Korea from
global victims was met with the outstanding, persistent investigative efforts of the FBI in close
collaboration with U.S. and international partners. By arresting facilitators, seizing funds, and
charging those responsible for the hacking conspiracy, the FBI continues to impose
consequences and hold North Korea accountable for its criminal cyber activity."
“The scope of the criminal conduct by the North Korean hackers was extensive and longrunning, and the range of crimes they have committed is staggering,” said Acting U.S.
Attorney Tracy L. Wilkison for the Central District of California. “The conduct detailed in the
indictment are the acts of a criminal nation-state that has stopped at nothing to extract
revenge and obtain money to prop up its regime.”
“This case is a particularly striking example of the growing alliance between officials within
some national governments and highly sophisticated cyber-criminals,” said U.S. Secret
Service Assistant Director Michael R. D’Ambrosio. “The individuals indicted today committed
a truly unprecedented range of financial and cyber-crimes: from ransomware attacks and
phishing campaigns, to digital bank heists and sophisticated money laundering operations.
With victims strewn across the globe, this case shows yet again that the challenge of
cybercrime is, and will continue to be, a struggle that can only be won through partnerships,
perseverance, and a relentless focus on holding criminals accountable.”
The hacking indictment filed in the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles alleges that Jon Chang
Hyok (전창혁), 31; Kim Il (김일), 27; and Park Jin Hyok (박진혁), 36, were members of units
of the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), a military intelligence agency of the
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), which engaged in criminal hacking. These
North Korean military hacking units are known by multiple names in the cybersecurity
community, including Lazarus Group and Advanced Persistent Threat 38 (APT38). Park was
previously charged in a criminal complaint unsealed in September 2018.

The indictment alleges a broad array of criminal cyber activities undertaken by the
conspiracy, in the United States and abroad, for revenge or financial gain. The schemes
alleged include:
Cyberattacks on the Entertainment Industry: The destructive cyberattack on Sony
Pictures Entertainment in November 2014 in retaliation for “The Interview,” a movie that
depicted a fictional assassination of the DPRK’s leader; the December 2014 targeting
of AMC Theatres, which was scheduled to show the film; and a 2015 intrusion into
Mammoth Screen, which was producing a fictional series involving a British nuclear
scientist taken prisoner in DPRK.
Cyber-Enabled Heists from Banks: Attempts from 2015 through 2019 to steal more
than $1.2 billion from banks in Vietnam, Bangladesh, Taiwan, Mexico, Malta, and Africa
by hacking the banks’ computer networks and sending fraudulent Society for
Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) messages.
Cyber-Enabled ATM Cash-Out Thefts: Thefts through ATM cash-out schemes –
referred to by the U.S. government as “FASTCash” – including the October 2018 theft
of $6.1 million from BankIslami Pakistan Limited (BankIslami).
Ransomware and Cyber-Enabled Extortion: Creation of the destructive WannaCry
2.0 ransomware in May 2017, and the extortion and attempted extortion of victim
companies from 2017 through 2020 involving the theft of sensitive data and
deployment of other ransomware.
Creation and Deployment of Malicious Cryptocurrency Applications: Development
of multiple malicious cryptocurrency applications from March 2018 through at least
September 2020 – including Celas Trade Pro, WorldBit-Bot, iCryptoFx, Union Crypto
Trader, Kupay Wallet, CoinGo Trade, Dorusio, CryptoNeuro Trader, and Ants2Whale –
which would provide the North Korean hackers a backdoor into the victims’ computers.
Targeting of Cryptocurrency Companies and Theft of Cryptocurrency: Targeting of
hundreds of cryptocurrency companies and the theft of tens of millions of dollars’ worth
of cryptocurrency, including $75 million from a Slovenian cryptocurrency company in
December 2017; $24.9 million from an Indonesian cryptocurrency company in
September 2018; and $11.8 million from a financial services company in New York in
August 2020 in which the hackers used the malicious CryptoNeuro Trader application
as a backdoor.
Spear-Phishing Campaigns: Multiple spear-phishing campaigns from March 2016
through February 2020 that targeted employees of United States cleared defense
contractors, energy companies, aerospace companies, technology companies, the
U.S.Department of State, and the U.S. Department of Defense.
Marine Chain Token and Initial Coin Offering: Development and marketing in 2017
and 2018 of the Marine Chain Token to enable investors to purchase fractional
ownership interests in marine shipping vessels, supported by a blockchain, which
would allow the DPRK to secretly obtain funds from investors, control interests in
marine shipping vessels, and evade U.S. sanctions.

According to the allegations contained in the hacking indictment, which was filed on Dec. 8,
2020, in the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles and unsealed today, the three defendants
were members of units of the RGB who were at times stationed by the North Korean
government in other countries, including China and Russia. While these defendants were
part of RGB units that have been referred to by cybersecurity researchers as Lazarus Group
and APT38, the indictment alleges that these groups engaged in a single conspiracy to
cause damage, steal data and money, and otherwise further the strategic and financial
interests of the DPRK government and its leader, Kim Jong Un.
Money Launderer Charged in California and Georgia
Federal prosecutors today also unsealed a charge against Ghaleb Alaumary, 37, of
Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, for his role as a money launderer for the North Korean
conspiracy, among other criminal schemes. Alaumary agreed to plead guilty to the charge,
which was filed in the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Nov. 17, 2020. Alaumary was a
prolific money launderer for hackers engaged in ATM cash-out schemes, cyber-enabled bank
heists, business email compromise (BEC) schemes, and other online fraud schemes.
Alaumary is also being prosecuted for his involvement in a separate BEC scheme by the
U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Georgia.
With respect to the North Korean co-conspirators’ activities, Alaumary organized teams of
co-conspirators in the United States and Canada to launder millions of dollars obtained
through ATM cash-out operations, including from BankIslami and a bank in India in 2018.
Alaumary also conspired with Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, aka “Ray Hushpuppi,” and others to
launder funds from a North Korean-perpetrated cyber-enabled heist from a Maltese bank in
February 2019. Last summer, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Los Angeles charged Abbas in a
separate case alleging that he conspired to launder hundreds of millions of dollars from BEC
frauds and other scams.
Accompanying Mitigation Efforts
Throughout the investigation, the FBI and the Justice Department provided specific
information to victims about how they had been targeted or compromised, as well as
information about the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the hackers with
the goals of remediating any intrusion and preventing future intrusions. That direct sharing of
information took place in the United States and in foreign countries, often with the assistance
of foreign law enforcement partners. The FBI also collaborated with certain private
cybersecurity companies by sharing and analyzing information about the intrusion TTPs
used by the members of the conspiracy.
In addition to the criminal charges, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security’s
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, in collaboration with the U.S. Department
of Treasury, today released a joint cybersecurity advisory and malware analysis reports
(MARs) regarding North Korean cryptocurrency malware. The joint cybersecurity analysis
4/6

and MARs highlight the cyber threat North Korea – which is referred to by the U.S.
government as HIDDEN COBRA – poses to cryptocurrency and identify malware and
indicators of compromise related to the “AppleJeus” family of malware (the name given by
the cybersecurity community to a family of North Korean malicious cryptocurrency
applications that includes Celas Trade Pro, WorldBit-Bot, Union Crypto Trader, Kupay Wallet,
CoinGo Trade, Dorusio, CryptoNeuro Trader, and Ants2Whale). The joint cybersecurity
advisory and MARs collectively provide the cybersecurity community and public with
information about identifying North Korean malicious cryptocurrency applications, avoiding
intrusions, and remedying infections.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office and FBI also obtained seizure warrants authorizing the FBI to
seize cryptocurrency stolen by the North Korean hackers from a victim in the indictment – a
financial services company in New York – held at two cryptocurrency exchanges. The
seizures include sums of multiple cryptocurrencies totaling approximately $1.9 million, which
will ultimately be returned to the victim.
Jon, Kim, and Park are charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and
abuse, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and one count of
conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 30
years in prison.
In relation to the case filed in Los Angeles, Alaumary has agreed to plead guilty to one count
of conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years
in prison.
The charges contained in the indictment are merely accusations and the defendants are
presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
The investigation of Jon, Kim, and Park was led by the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office, which
worked closely with the FBI’s Charlotte Field Office. The U.S. Secret Service’s Los Angeles
Field Office and Global Investigative Operations Center provided substantial assistance. The
FBI’s Cyber Division also provided substantial assistance.
The investigations of Alaumary were conducted by the U.S. Secret Service’s Savannah Field
Office, FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office, and the U.S. Secret Service’s Los Angeles Field
Office and Global Investigative Operations Center. The FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division
also provided substantial assistance.
The case against Jon, Kim, and Park is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Anil J.
Antony and Khaldoun Shobaki of the Cyber and Intellectual Property Crimes Section, with
substantial assistance from Trial Attorney Scott Claffee of the Department of Justice National
Security Division’s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.

Assistant U.S. Attorneys Antony and Shobaki are also prosecuting the case against
Alaumary, in which the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Georgia and the
Criminal Division’s Computer Crimes and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) provided
substantial assistance. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Antony and Shobaki, along with Assistant
U.S. Attorney Jonathan Galatzan of the Asset Forfeiture Section, also obtained the seizure
warrants for cryptocurrency stolen from the financial services company in New York.
The Criminal Division’s Office of International Affairs provided assistance throughout these
investigations, as did many of the FBI’s Legal Attachés, as well as foreign authorities around
the world. Numerous victims cooperated and provided valuable assistance.
