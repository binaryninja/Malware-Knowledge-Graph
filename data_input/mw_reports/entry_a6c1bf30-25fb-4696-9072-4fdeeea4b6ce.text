Abstract
Given the vast number of security breaches via the
internet, The Robin Sage Experiment seeks to exploit
the fundamental levels of information leakage—the
outflow of information as a result of people’s hap‐
hazard and unquestioned trust. The experiment was
conducted by creating a blatantly false identity and
enrolling on various social networking websites. By
joining networks, registering on mailing lists, and listing
false credentials, the conditions were then set to
research people’s decisions to trust and share
information with the false identity. The main factors
observed were: the ability to exploit other individuals’
level of trust based on gender, occupation,
education/credentials, and friends (connections).
By the end of this experiment, Robin finished the
month having accumulated hundreds of connections
through various social networking sites. Contacts
included executives at government entities such as the
NSA, DOD and Military Intelligence groups. Other
friends came from Global 500 corporations.
Throughout the experiment Robin was offered gifts,
government and corporate jobs, and options to speak
at a variety of security conferences.
Through this 28‐day experiment, it became evident
that the propagation of a false identity via social
networking websites can be rampant and viral. Much
of the information revealed to Robin Sage violated
OPSEC and PERSEC procedures. The deliberate choice
of an attractive young female appears to have exposed
the role that sex and appearance plays in trust and
people’s eagerness to connect with someone. In
conjunction with her look, Robin Sage’s credentials
listed on her profile resulted in selection perception;
people’s tendency to draw unwarranted conclusions in
their attempt to make a quick decision. By acquiring a
large number of connections, Robin had the ability to
identify the individual who was positioned to provide
the most intelligence based on their involvement in
multiple government agencies. The false identity
combined with carefully chosen false credentials led to
a false trust that could have resulted in the breach of
multiple security protocols.

Creating the Persona
The success of the Robin Sage Experiment relied
heavily on the calculated creation of Robin’s
gender, occupation, education, credentials, and
friends (connections). Determining the false
identity’s characteristics directly led to the wide
variety of reasons people chose to connect.
Moreover, as Robin’s network grew, so did the
potential gain for her new connections?

Gender
Choosing a young, attractive, and edgy female
was a deliberate decision on the part of the
creator. Today, the vast majority of the
security industry is comprised of males. The
heavily male dominated sector allows women
to be a commodity in more ways than one. For
example, just as women have proven to offer
fresh new perspectives in the fields of
marketing, journalism, and business, they are
also able to assess security matters with a
different outlook.
Some of Robin’s male connections took a more
assertive approach by offering her tickets to
security conferences, complimenting her
pictures, and presenting available job
opportunities. Whether these same reactions
would have been elicited towards another male
is questionable. It can be put forth that Robin’s
appearance and gender played a key role in
many people’s comfort level. Furthermore,
flirtatious gestures’ regarding her picture
reveals that her attractiveness led to the
success of her propagation. One connection
commented, “Greeeat pics,” while another
charmed her with, “You have to forgive me but
I never forget a face (esp. one as pretty as
yours)." These overt compliments develop the
initial sense of trust that Robin established with
her newly formed “friends.”

Occupation
Robin Sage’s present job was listed as “Cyber Threat
Analyst” at Naval Network Warfare Command. This
position suggested that she not only had seasoned
expertise, but she also had passed the trusted
background checks of the government. Many security
professionals made these quick, yet inaccurate
assumptions when considering Sage’s occupation. This
green light in terms of trust led her “friends” to offer
further advancements in her career.
With no experience at all, Robin was asked to review
papers written by professionals with over 10 years
experience. For example, a fellow lecturer at the NASA
Ames Research Center sought out Sage’s knowledge
and opinions pertaining to some of his papers and
presentations. One professional introduces himself on
LinkedIn with, “I am a Senior Business
Development/Marketing/Sales Executive Consultant
with 20 years+ in the Federal Government Homeland
Security/Civilian/DoD Security Marketplace.” While his
introduction may suggest he is well acquainted with
the security world, his fall for Robin Sage proved
otherwise. Though he claims to have “expertise in the
Cyber‐Security [field],” he not only trusted Robin
enough to connect with her, but he also privately
messaged her with the hopes of a phone conversation
to discuss her cyber intelligence background. Open
requests such as these have the serious potential of
opening a means of communication for private and/or
information to be exchanged.

Education & Credentials
The power of one’s network is only as strong as the
people within it.
Robin’s first class education
combined with her certifications proved her worthy of
any security professional’s web of connections.
Because her experience demonstrated an expansive
knowledge of the security field, the benefits of
connecting with Robin included possible job
opportunities, knowledge growth, and helpful
contacts.

Throughout
the
experiment,
various
professionals approached Robin regarding job
opportunities. Again, it can be surmised that
these invitations were a result of her false
education and credentials. The methodical
creation of the identity’s background played a
pivotal role in the confidence people had in her
actual existence.
Fellow alumni from her high school network, St.
Paul’s School, and her college network,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),
chose to link to her on the basis of common
educational ties. With no actual verification of
her attendance, people entered into another
level of trust based on no facts whatsoever.

“Friends”,
“Followers”

“Connections”,

and

Robin Sage’s friends served as her largest basis
of garnering trust from her targeted
professionals.
After acquiring just a few
respected friends, Robin had what she needed
to propagate the security field. The creator
carefully chose security experts such as
Jeremiah Grossman (Co‐Founder and CTO of
WhiteHat Security), Dan Kaminsky (Director of
Penetration Testing at IOActive), and Marc
Maffrett (Chief Security Architect at FireEye).
By successfully fooling some of the most
respected specialists in the security sector,
Robin’s credibility rapidly soared.
The success of a network is directly tied to the
people and connections that one forms.
Effectively targeting a person can be done in
various indirect ways.
For example, one
connection messaged Robin, “I've never met
you, but I saw you had Marty on your Facebook
list, so that was good enough for me.” This
message encompasses the dangers of social
networking when people fail to do their own
research and instead, rely on other’s judgment.

Analysis Details
A closer look at the creation of Robin’s profile reveals
that there were many opportunities for people to
realize that this was a false identity. This section will
first explore the oversights on behalf of the people that
chose to connect to Robin Sage. It will then delve into
the implications that develop when the initial trust is
granted to a cyber predator.

Gender Implications
Drawing conclusions based on Robin Sage’s
appearance and gender is the initial mistake on the
part of the target. Using advanced facial recognition
software, the victim could have traced the profile
picture to its origin‐a pornographic website, and
determined that the identity undoubtedly did not
match. While getting your hands on software like this
is not always so simple, there are other ways the target
could have examined these pictures to conclude that
the profile was counterfeit.
Robin Sage, on first glance, fit the profile of a young
professional; fashionable in style, and flirtatious in
personality. However, red flags should have been
raised in assessing her number of pictures. Why would
someone who appeared so social, have such few
pictures? And, why would someone who touted their
professional background on each social networking
forum, use such unprofessional photographs?
It can certainly be argued that social networking
websites stand as platforms for more relaxed
professional networking. Robin’s identity, had it been
real, may have just posted her casual pictures because
this type of connecting resembles nothing of a cocktail
party. However, the profile viewer should have asked
these questions and perhaps after assessing her other
characteristics, he or she would have rendered a more
accurate answer towards the question of her actual
existence.

Occupation Implications
Careful attention to Robin’s work experience
and a few searches in Google, would have
revealed that her occupational title does not
even exist. This should have immediately
raised skepticism on the part of the profile
viewer. Moreover, her LinkedIn introduction
speaks to her ten years of cyber security
experience. However, this time frame would
have put the young professional into the
security field at the age of fifteen. Though
there are anomalies of young teenagers
mastering computer hacking skills at
exceptionally young ages, the likelihood of
these cases are small and incredibly rare.

type of communication would allow someone to learn
more about the company’s goals, security, and
salaries. Had Robin submitted a false resume and been
offered a phone screening interview, the person
behind the false identity would have had the
opportunity to inquire more about the company.
Though simple questions about a company may not
initially appear threatening, the emergence of social
engineering suggests otherwise. Pointed and carefully
worded questions can often reveal far more
information than what may appear on the surface.
The only solution to avoiding these types of situations
is to not befriend a false identity in the first place.

Education/Credentials Implications
As people sought Robin’s professional advice,
they placed themselves in an extremely
vulnerable position. If the creator behind Robin
had intentions other than to perform a social
experiment, he would have had means to
mislead experts in their studies and even steal
their research. As noted in the previous
section, the fellow lecturer at the NASA Ames
Research Center offered to share his paper with
Sage. Had his paper not yet been published,
Robin would have gathered information and
statistical data that she could have turned
around and claimed to be her own.
Furthermore, if Robin wanted to misguide the
expert, she could have pointed the lecturer in
an entirely different direction, and because he
had already made the decision to trust her, he
may have fallen prey to her tactics.
Professionals can also waste a considerable
amount of their time pursuing false identities
such as Robin’s in order to fill positions. For
example, Sage received messages from one job
recruiter with the hopes of placing her in a
Senior Research Analyst Position in Atlanta,
Georgia. Not only did the recruiter spend time
explaining the position, but she also requested
Robin’s resume for review. Opening up this

Robin’s education and credentials complimented her
false occupation and helped grow her number of
connections. Often times, peripheral information like
this plays a critical role in developing trust. While a
picture or an occupation may initially appear
unconvincing, an identity’s education and training
background may all one need’s to be swayed.
It is important to note that some security experts
properly vetted Robin Sage’s background. Perhaps by
practicing these techniques, other professionals may
avoid making the same mistake in the future. One
security specialist, who goes by the name Simple
Nomad, reached out to a friend who was an MIT
alumnus. By asking a trusted friend to review his MIT
alumni network, Simple Nomad was able to conclude
that Robin Sage was neither an MIT alumnus, nor an
actual person. University networks are significantly
more reliable than networks such as LinkedIn,
Facebook, and Twitter. Their alumni offices keep
official records of current and previous students. By
consulting a trusted friend and fact checking with a
reliable network, Robin Sage’s identity was proven
false.
John Tierney, a security professional based out of New
York , called Robin Sage’s bluff by researching her NSA
IAM (INFOSEC Assessment Methodology) credentials.
By reviewing public information, Tierney managed to

deduce that the identity was false. Public
information includes a rating program and
provides a list of every individual that passed
the NSA IAM courses. The absence of Robin
Sage’s name or any name similar to Sage’s
confirmed that she did not exist. More often
than not, public information that is readily
available is all that is needed to prove a false
identity.
The risk in trusting qualifications to voluntarily
seems obvious.
Sage’s multiple security
credentials combined with her occupation
would lead one to believe that she had TS/SCI
(Top
Secret/Sensitive
Compartment
Information) Clearance with Polygraph.
People’s trust in this identity could have very
easily led to the sharing of information under
the false premise that Robin Sage had expertise
in the field.

Friends, “Connections,” and Followers
Implications
Many social networking websites have a
section to show users who their mutual friends
are with another person.
LinkedIn uses
numbers to show the degrees of separation
between connections.
These strategies
encourage people to grow their network by
establishing trust based on mutual friends. For
example, though someone may not have
known Robin Sage, their decision to link to
them may have been based on the fact that five
of their other respectable friends chose to do
the same. As discussed in a previous example,
one professional (Senior Attack Pattern Analyst
for CAPEC at MITRE) accepted Robin’s
friendship request because his peer had done
so.
Cyber predators are aware of this “mutual
friends” oversight that social networking users
frequently make. To exploit the weakness,
lurkers pinpoint the person they are pursuing
and indirectly track them. By connecting with a
Provide Security | Getting In Bed With Robin Sage

number of the target’s friends, the predator is building
a line of trust with his target without the victim even
knowing. Therefore, when it comes time to connect
with the targeted individual, mutual friends stand as a
comfort factor for the target. Because his or her
friends trusted this false identity, it is more likely that
the request to connect will be accepted.
To avoid being fooled by a fictitious individual on
account of the “mutual friend” tactic, it is important to
take a closer at the identity’s profile. In the case of
Robin Sage, users should have noticed that all of her
friends/connections were formed in a very small time
span. In the duration of one week, the identity formed
a Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook and was rapidly
making connections with people. Furthermore, mutual
friends often sprout from a single common tie that two
users have. However, if the mutual friends seem
disconnected and unrelated, it is imperative that the
user investigates further. The best‐suited defense is to
reach out to the mutual friends and ask about their
relationship with the questioned identity. A simple
inquiry regarding the profile may confirm or deny the
individual’s authenticity.

Looking Ahead
Before moving into the future, it is essential that
appropriate lessons be derived from mistakes in the
past. The Robin Sage experiment was created with the
intentions of bringing awareness to the risks that social
networking can pose when proper vetting is not
performed.
In the past, Facebook required users to provide emails
that verified their attendance to universities and
institutions. However, since Facebook opened its
gates to the greater public on September 26, 2006, it
drastically increased the ways in which predators can
create false identities. In the future, it is imperative
that social networking sites explore sounder and more
effective ways to prohibit the creation of fictitious
profiles. As these websites continue to grow, they
must take responsibility for the safety of their millions
of users. While Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter may

impose better inspection practices, the only
person who can entirely insure their own safety
is you.
This paper has adequately outlined various
ways to properly examine profiles prior to
accepting connection requests. Careful reviews
of small details such as pictures, work
experience, and credentials may provide just
enough insight to refrain from linking to
harmful individuals. Take the extra time to
consult mutual friends or quickly perform your
own research through the use of any common
search engine. More often than not, false
identities, just like Robin Sage, intentionally and
unintentionally, leave simple clues for you
along the way.
