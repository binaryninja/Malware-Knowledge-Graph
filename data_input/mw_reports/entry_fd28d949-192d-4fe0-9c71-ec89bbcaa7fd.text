SECURITY

1/8

By John Stoner December 17, 2020
As your team responds to the SolarWinds security advisory, we wanted to provide additional
guidance to help you more effectively ingest threat indicators to combat the Sunburst
Backdoor malware in Splunk Enterprise Security (ES). After applying these tips, you can
jump into this blog, "Using Splunk to Detect Sunburst Backdoor," and take action.
While the existing method of downloading indicators into Splunk Enterprise has been in
place for a long time whether you’re running ES 6.4 or older versions like ES 4.5, we have a
few tips and tricks to share that will hopefully smooth out some bumps you may have

2/8

encountered in the past.

The Issues with Fields
One of the greatest pain points encountered when ingesting threat indicators is the naming
of fields. The threat intelligence framework expects that specific header field values are
being utilized. The reference for this can be found here.
For example, if I am pulling a list of IP addresses in, the framework is expecting the field
that contains the IP address to be called “IP” – not dest, src, source_ip or anything else, just
“IP”. Similarly, for a domain name, it is looking for the field domain. Below is an example
from the link above.

To illustrate this, we are going to use the GitHub repository for Sunburst Backdoor that
Shannon Davis created as an example. I started off by creating two intelligence downloads
called SunburstDomain and SunburstIP. I have configured the type, description and the
URL that it is pulling from.

When I click on each one and scroll down, I can see parsing options. Notice in Fields we
are looking in the first column of the csv file for values that will populate the ip field and the
description column will be filled with a constant of SunburstIPListing.

Similarly in our domain download, the domain values are in the first position on the list,
which is why we are using $1 to denote where to look. We are also using a constant again
to describe the list. This time, I have ignored the wisdom of using the supported type of
threat intel and instead of calling my first field domain, I am calling it “url_domain”.

While the threat intel download will save and the file will download, I find myself to be
disappointed because these domains are not populating my lookups. How can I try to
troubleshoot this?
The good news is there are a number of places that can be reviewed along the way to
determine what is going wrong.

Tips and Tricks
Start by ensuring that the Intelligence Downloads are enabled.
From there, check and see if the file has been downloaded by going to Audit – Threat
Intelligence Audit in Enterprise Security. The download_status should show that the threat
list has been downloaded. If it didn’t, chances are that the URL is not correct.

For skeptics like me, knowing where the threat intelligence files have been downloaded to is
a nice piece of information to have. From the command line, go to
$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/SA-ThreatIntelligence/local/data/threat_intel/ directory. If the
files have been successfully downloaded, both the SunburstDomain and SunburstIP files
can be viewed in the file system. The naming convention of the files are based on the name
specified in the Intelligence Downloads.

Now that I know the files are there, how do I know that they are being parsed and loaded to
lookups?
The lower half of the Threat Intelligence Audit dashboard has all of the audit logs pertaining
to parsing the threat intelligence and loading of it so that is another nice place to look. That
said, it is limited to the last 1000 events and if I want to focus on my two downloads,
opening it and then adding my own file names might be a good choice.
eventtype=threatintel_internal_logs (SunburstIP.csv OR SunburstDomain.csv)

If I look closely at these two events, I want to highlight what the thrill of victory and the
agony of defeat looks like. (Hopefully that resonates with a few of you who grew up
watching the Wide World of Sports.) The second event in the image below shows that the
IP addresses have been written to the collection. IP addresses are loaded!!!

5/8

The first event has thrown an error and this is due to the use of url_domain instead of
domain for our field name and this has caused an exception in processing the file. The
framework doesn’t know what to do with the downloaded data so it throws an error and
moves on. This is definitely something to look for in events and if this error is seen, check
the parsing options to ensure the field names used are defined by ES.

At this point I am going to set the domain indicators aside and finish up with the IP address.
There are a few intermediate steps that happen that I won’t bore you with, the "Enterprise
Security Biology" from .conf2017 covers that in gory detail, but what we are striving for is
that the data gets loaded to the KVStore into the various threat collections, depending on
the type of indicator.
| inputlookup ip_intel | search description=SunburstIPListing

In this case, I can search the ip_intel table to see if the indicators have been loaded.
Because I want to focus on the SunburstIPListing, which if you recall is the description that I
added into the parsing options, I can use a | search to narrow my results set to just that list.
From there, the threat intelligence framework takes over and a series of savedsearches run
on an on-going basis to correlate events with the different threat collections and write the
data to the threat_activity datamodel. The correlation search will then run on a scheduled
6/8

basis and pluck the new items out of the datamodel and create notables out of them.
I hope this has been helpful and will streamline your onboarding of these threat indicators
into your Splunk Enterprise Security instance.

I grew up in Virginia, graduated from Penn State and came back to Virginia where I have
worked with databases and cyber for over 20 years. A job or two felt like I really was a cast
member of The Office or Office Space, but every one of them taught me something new.
