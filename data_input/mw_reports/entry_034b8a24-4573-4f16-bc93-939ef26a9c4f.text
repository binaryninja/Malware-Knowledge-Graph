First stage of infection
The dropper
When the exploit becomes active, an executable file with a dropper program is launched on the
attacked PC. It contains the malicious program’s encrypted installers intended for 32-bit and 64-bit
operating systems:

Encrypted installers in the dropper’s resources
The dropper determines whether it is running in a 32-bit or 64-bit environment, decrypts the
appropriate installer, places it in the %temp% folder with a name that uses the format kb[set of random
characters].tmp, and launches it for execution. After this, the dropper’s process terminates.

The installer: main shellcode and DLL

The installer then starts infecting the system. In order to establish a foothold, it displays non-typical
behavior:
1. Writes its main module to the registry – a shellcode that is stored in a registry parameter of
the type REG_BINARY in a key with a random name starting with “M”, such as
‘HKCU\Software\Mbaccbbg’. The shellcode is stored in XOR-encrypted format with the last
character in the key name used as the argument for XOR.
2. Modifies the parameter ‘Path’ (which is the user environment variable) in the key
‘hkcu\environment’, writing the path to the temporary folder %temp%.
3. Reads the memory of the explorer.exe process and searches for a suitable string that will be
used to force the loading of a malicious DLL into this system process.
4. Creates a DLL in the temporary folder %temp%; the DLL name consists of the string found in
the memory of the explorer.exe process (for example, the DLL name rer.pdb is from the
appropriate string explorer.pdb found in the explorer.exe memory).
5. Injects the DLL into the running explorer.exe process with the help of the QueueUserAPC
function. The address of kernel32.LoadLibraryA is sent as the first parameter, and the address
of the string obtained in step 3 is sent as the third parameter for the QueueUserAPC function.
After the malicious DLL is successfully injected into the explorer.exe process, the installer
deletes the path to %temp% from the environment variable ‘Path’. If the function LoadLibraryA
is called in the context of the explorer.exe process, and the string provided on entry is not a
complete valid path to the DLL that is to be injected, the function will search for that path in
the %temp% folder, and if found, the DLL will be loaded into the memory. This way, the
malicious code is loaded into the explorer.exe process without being written to the process
memory.
6. The installer copies one of the system libraries to %temp% with the name format kb[set of
random characters].ini and modifies it by extending the resource section and changing the
entry point to the beginning of the injected malicious code. This means the malicious code is
given control the moment the library is loaded to the process’s memory.

7. The installer then sends a command to the library injected earlier into the explorer.exe process
to place the modified system library in the folder %WINDIR%.

DLL hijacking
The method this malicious program employs to establish a foothold within the system is DLL hijacking
in respect to the explorer.exe process. Each time the system boots, the explorer.exe process loads the
modified malicious program into the memory; the malicious program is located in the same folder as
the file explorer.exe. Once loaded into the memory of the explorer.exe process, the malicious library
reads the parameter with the shellcode from the registry, decrypts it and launches for execution. This
is the principal payload of the malicious program.
If the installer Microcin detects any running anti-malware processes before it establishes itself in the
system, then the malicious library is not force-loaded into the context of the explorer.exe process
during installation. If User Access Control is enabled, the installer places the modified system library
into the folder %WINDIR% using the system app wusa.exe, a standalone Windows update installer, with
the parameter “/extract”. This is an auto-elevated application, and User Access Control in standard
settings does not require user involvement to place the modified library in the required location
(%WINDIR%).
It should be noted that this method will not work under Windows 10, as Microsoft has removed the
parameter “/extract” from the parameters list of the wusa.exe utility.

Establishing persistence
The main shellcode
After launching, the main shellcode, which contains the necessary addresses, contacts its C&C servers:



hand.wid******lay[.]com –> 127.0.0.1



foot.bac******ike[.]com –> 45.**.***.192

The first is likely the fallback C&C server, it corresponds to the loopback IP address 127.0.0.1.
The second C&C is only intermittently active, it goes online to receive information from infected
computers or send commands to the shellcode.
To contact the C&C, the malicious program sends a request to a link in the format
‘/index.asp?ID=hhhtjqmrspjnQ’, where the red string is generated depending on the parameters of the

infected operating system. The malicious program sends this request (a ping) every minute to the C&C
and analyses the response.
In most cases, the response is empty, a simple pong:

However, while we were monitoring the C&C we saw the response ‘hj1000198377=’ being sent. The
bot recognized this as a task to download the file ‘\0001.jpg’ from the C&C domain, which it did:

The main shellcode downloads a JPEG image
The main shellcode can process three commands. The first two involve the decryption and launching
of an MZPE file or a shellcode (with or without saving to disk), and the third command relates to the
deleting of a parameter with an additional shellcode (module) in the registry.
The file 0001.jpg which the malicious program downloads from the server is a JPEG image.

The image downloaded by the malicious program
This image exists in an online gallery where its file name is ‘kariminal_rider’.
The malicious code searches for the special marker ‘ABCD’ in the downloaded image and decrypts data
using the following algorithm:

Procedure for decrypting the additional shellcode from the image
After decrypting the image’s contents located at displacement 0x0D from the marker ‘ABCD’, the
following code becomes visible:

Decrypted code contained in the image
This is the second shellcode – the additional module that is downloaded and installed by the main
shellcode.

The additional module
The additional module is also saved in the registry in a parameter of the type REG_BINARY within the
key ‘hkcu\software\microini’. When the primary shellcode starts operating, it checks if this key is
present; if it is, the parameter’s content is read, decrypted and launched.

The additional module stored within the registry parameter
The additional module also contains the C&C address:
bird.sin******oll[.]com --> 45.**.***.192
This same IP address also corresponds to foot.bac******ike[.]com, one of the main module’s C&Cs.
The additional malicious module was named ‘DiskSearch.dll’ by its developer. It enables the attackers
to gain access to the file system: receive information about the partitions existing in the system, search
for the necessary files, move and delete them and send them to a remote server. However, this is only
a fraction of what the module does; it is a full-fledged backdoor that can gain control over the infected
system, i.e. work with the registry and services, launch applications, obtain a list of processes,

terminate an arbitrary process, launch a console (cmd.exe) for remote execution of commands, re-boot
and switch off the system. It can also take screenshots and send them to the malicious server.

The search procedure for files in the folder

Establishing persistence: other malicious tools
We searched Kaspersky Lab’s cloud technologies for the domain names used by Microcin and found
that other malicious modules had also been downloaded from the URL address
foot.bac******ike[.]com. These modules were used not only in Microcin attacks but also in other
cyberespionage campaigns, some of which are still active.


foot.bac******ike[.]com/whale32.jpg (and its 64-bit version whale64.jpg in the same
location), despite its extension, is an MZPE file. This backdoor is designed to execute a
cybercriminal’s commands, send data from infected computers, execute files, obtain
information about the system, etc. The C&C URL is whale.dee******ave[.]com (IP:
104.207.130.19). It works via HTTPS.
foot.bac******ike[.]com/ocean.jpg is also an MZPE file and also a backdoor. However, its C&C
is located at vodxe.k*****c[.]com (IP: 45.**.**.65). Using this malicious program, the
cybercriminal can execute commands on the infected computer, delete files, receive files,
collect information about the system, recursively delete folders, install and launch services,
create screenshots, terminate processes, etc.



This backdoor is launched using the DLL hijacking method, using a legitimate, digitally signed
application to conceal the malicious activity, and has the internal name RingDllWM.dll
assigned by the module’s developer.



foot.bac******ike[.]com/updater.jpg is a component of the malicious program Microcin,
designed to update the main shellcode in the registry.

Completing the mission – PowerATK
When we obtained the URL address of the backdoor’s C&C named ‘whale’ (whale.dee******ave.com),
we found an open folder that was essentially a git-clone of PowerSploit – a ready-to-use toolkit of
Powershell modules used in penetration tests. Those behind Microcin added a number of extra
malicious programs to the standard PowerSploit toolkit and used it to steal information from infected
PCs:

Contents of the root folder on the backdoor’s C&C

Contents of the folder PowerATK_PS on the backdoor’s C&C

Function within one of the Powershell modules that was launched on the victim PC under the
name update.vbs with the help of a special VBS file
The cybercriminals behind the Microcin attack also have other malicious programs in their arsenal.
These include a utility that secretly sends collected data to a malicious server with the help of the
system program bitsadmin.exe, various utilities to obtain login credentials from browsers, a keylogger,
as well as batch files to collect and create password-protected archives of isolated data collected by
the above utilities, and save them to a specific place so they can later be sent to cybercriminals.
