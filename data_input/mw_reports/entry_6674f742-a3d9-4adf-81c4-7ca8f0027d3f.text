Mebromi rootkit also targets master boot record
Dan Goodin Wed 14 Sep 2011 // 04:53 UTC
Researchers have discovered one of the first pieces of malware ever used in the wild that
modifies the software on the motherboard of infected computers to ensure the infection can't
be easily eradicated.
Known as Trojan.Mebromi, the rootkit reflashes the BIOS of computers it attacks to add
malicious instructions that are executed early in a computer's boot-up sequence. The
instructions, in turn, alter a computer's MBR, or master boot record, another system
component that gets executed prior to the loading of the operating system of an infected
machine. By corrupting the processes that run immediately after a PC starts, the malware
stands a better chance of surviving attempts by antivirus programs to remove it.
In addition to posing a threat to end users, Mebroot could create serious obstacles to
antivirus developers in producing products that scrub computers clean of detected threats
without harming the underlying system.

A flowchart from Symantec detailing Mebromi's BIOS tampering process.
"Storing the malicious code inside the BIOS ROM could actually become more than just a
problem for security software, giv[en] the fact that even if antivirus detect[s] and clean[s] the
MBR infection, it will be restored at the next system startup when the malicious BIOS
payload would overwrite the MBR code again," Webroot researcher Marco Giuliani wrote in a
blog post published Tuesday. "Developing an antivirus utility able to clean the BIOS code is a
challenge, because it needs to be totally error-proof, to avoid rendering the system
unbootable at all."
He went on to say the job of ridding malicious instructions added to the BIOS ultimately
should be left to the makers of the motherboards that store the startup code. Because the
BIOS is stored on an EEPROM, or electronically erasable programmable read-only-memory

chip, modifications have the potential to render a computer largely inoperable with no easy
way to fix it.
The discovery represents one of the few times researchers have documented malware used
in the wild that modifies the BIOS. In the late 1990s, malware known as CIH/Chernobyl did
much the same thing on machines running Windows 9x by exploiting a privilege escalation
bug in the Microsoft operating systems. In 2007, proof-of-concept software known as IceLord
also reportedly made changes to the BIOS of infected machines, but there are no reports it
has ever been used in actual attacks.
Mebromi is able to attack only BIOS ROMs made by Award, a manufacturer that was
purchased by Phoenix in the late 1990s. The malware checks the BIOS ROM each time the
PC boots up. If it's made by Award and the malicious instructions aren't found, Mebromi adds
the code by reflashing the chip on the motherboard. According to Giuliani, it was first
documented by the Chinese security company Qihoo 360, and primarily infects computers in
that country.

Stolen university credentials up for sale by Russian crooks, FBI warns
Forget dark-web souks, thousands of these are already being traded on public bazaars
Jessica Lyons Hardcastle Fri 27 May 2022 // 22:34 UTC
Russian crooks are selling network credentials and virtual private network access for a
"multitude" of US universities and colleges on criminal marketplaces, according to the
FBI.
According to a warning issued on Thursday, these stolen credentials sell for thousands
of dollars on both dark web and public internet forums, and could lead to subsequent
cyberattacks against individual employees or the schools themselves.
"The exposure of usernames and passwords can lead to brute force credential stuffing
computer network attacks, whereby attackers attempt logins across various internet
sites or exploit them for subsequent cyber attacks as criminal actors take advantage of
users recycling the same credentials across multiple accounts, internet sites, and
services," the Feds' alert [PDF] said.

Big Tech loves talking up privacy – while trying to kill privacy legislation
Study claims Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft work to derail data rules
Thomas Claburn in San Francisco Fri 27 May 2022 // 21:48 UTC 2
Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft often support privacy in public
statements, but behind the scenes they've been working through some common
organizations to weaken or kill privacy legislation in US states.
That's according to a report this week from news non-profit The Markup, which said the
corporations hire lobbyists from the same few groups and law firms to defang or drown
state privacy bills.
The report examined 31 states when state legislatures were considering privacy
legislation and identified 445 lobbyists and lobbying firms working on behalf of Amazon,
Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, along with industry groups like TechNet and the
State Privacy and Security Coalition.

SEC probes Musk for not properly disclosing Twitter stake
Meanwhile, social network's board rejects resignation of one its directors
Katyanna Quach Fri 27 May 2022 // 21:26 UTC 2
America's financial watchdog is investigating whether Elon Musk adequately disclosed
his purchase of Twitter shares last month, just as his bid to take over the social media
company hangs in the balance.
A letter [PDF] from the SEC addressed to the tech billionaire said he "[did] not appear"
to have filed the proper form detailing his 9.2 percent stake in Twitter "required 10 days
from the date of acquisition," and asked him to provide more information. Musk's
shares made him one of Twitter's largest shareholders. The letter is dated April 4, and
was shared this week by the regulator.
Musk quickly moved to try and buy the whole company outright in a deal initially worth
over $44 billion. Musk sold a chunk of his shares in Tesla worth $8.4 billion and bagged
another $7.14 billion from investors to help finance the $21 billion he promised to put
forward for the deal. The remaining $25.5 billion bill was secured via debt financing by
Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Barclays, and others. But the takeover is not going
smoothly.

Cloud security unicorn cuts 20% of staff after raising $1.3b
Time to play blame bingo: Markets? Profits? Too much growth? Russia? Space aliens?
Jessica Lyons Hardcastle Fri 27 May 2022 // 19:19 UTC 6
Cloud security company Lacework has laid off 20 percent of its employees, just months
after two record-breaking funding rounds pushed its valuation to $8.3 billion.
A spokesperson wouldn't confirm the total number of employees affected, though told
The Register that the "widely speculated number on Twitter is a significant
overestimate."
The company, as of March, counted more than 1,000 employees, which would push
the jobs lost above 200. And the widely reported number on Twitter is about 300
employees. The biz, based in Silicon Valley, was founded in 2015.

Talos names eight deadly sins in widely used industrial software
Entire swaths of gear relies on vulnerability-laden Open Automation Software (OAS)
Jeff Burt Fri 27 May 2022 // 18:30 UTC
A researcher at Cisco's Talos threat intelligence team found eight vulnerabilities in the
Open Automation Software (OAS) platform that, if exploited, could enable a bad actor
to access a device and run code on a targeted system.
The OAS platform is widely used by a range of industrial enterprises, essentially
facilitating the transfer of data within an IT environment between hardware and
software and playing a central role in organizations' industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)
efforts. It touches a range of devices, including PLCs and OPCs and IoT devices, as
well as custom applications and APIs, databases and edge systems.
Companies like Volvo, General Dynamics, JBT Aerotech and wind-turbine maker AES
are among the users of the OAS platform.

Despite global uncertainty, $500m hit doesn't rattle Nvidia execs
CEO acknowledges impact of war, pandemic but says fundamentals ‘are really good’
Dylan Martin Fri 27 May 2022 // 16:08 UTC 1
Nvidia is expecting a $500 million hit to its global datacenter and consumer business in
the second quarter due to COVID lockdowns in China and Russia's invasion of
Ukraine. Despite those and other macroeconomic concerns, executives are still
optimistic about future prospects.
"The full impact and duration of the war in Ukraine and COVID lockdowns in China is
difficult to predict. However, the impact of our technology and our market opportunities
remain unchanged," said Jensen Huang, Nvidia's CEO and co-founder, during the
company's first-quarter earnings call.
Those two statements might sound a little contradictory, including to some investors,
particularly following the stock selloff yesterday after concerns over Russia and China
prompted Nvidia to issue lower-than-expected guidance for second-quarter revenue.

Another AI supercomputer from HPE: Champollion lands in France
That's the second in a week following similar system in Munich also aimed at
researchers
Dan Robinson Fri 27 May 2022 // 15:30 UTC
HPE is lifting the lid on a new AI supercomputer – the second this week – aimed at
building and training larger machine learning models to underpin research.
Based at HPE's Center of Excellence in Grenoble, France, the new supercomputer is
to be named Champollion after the French scholar who made advances in deciphering
Egyptian hieroglyphs in the 19th century. It was built in partnership with Nvidia using
AMD-based Apollo computer nodes fitted with Nvidia's A100 GPUs.
Champollion brings together HPC and purpose-built AI technologies to train machine
learning models at scale and unlock results faster, HPE said. HPE already provides
HPC and AI resources from its Grenoble facilities for customers, and the broader
research community to access, and said it plans to provide access to Champollion for
scientists and engineers globally to accelerate testing of their AI models and research.

UK monopoly watchdog investigates Google's online advertising business
Another probe? Mountain View is starting to look like a pincushion at this rate
Richard Currie Fri 27 May 2022 // 14:00 UTC 3
The UK's Competition and Markets Authority is lining up yet another investigation into
Google over its dominance of the digital advertising market.
This latest inquiry, announced Thursday, is the second major UK antitrust investigation
into Google this year alone. In March this year the UK, together with the European
Union, said it wished to examine Google's "Jedi Blue" agreement with Meta to allegedly
favor the former's Open Bidding ads platform.
The news also follows proposals last week by a bipartisan group of US lawmakers to
create legislation that could force Alphabet's Google, Meta's Facebook, and Amazon to
divest portions of their ad businesses.

Microsoft slows some hiring for Windows, Teams, and Office
'Making sure the right resources are aligned to the right opportunity' ahead of next
fiscal year
Richard Speed Fri 27 May 2022 // 13:31 UTC 5
Microsoft has hit the brakes on hiring in some key product areas as the company
prepares for the next fiscal year and all that might bring.
According to reports in the Bloomberg, the unit that develops Windows, Office, and
Teams is affected and while headcount remains expected to grow, new hires in that
division must first be approved by bosses.
During a talk this week at JP Morgan's Technology, Media and Communications
Conference, Rajesh Jha, executive VP for the Office Product Group, noted that within
three years he expected approximately two-thirds of CIOs to standardize on Microsoft
Teams. 1.4 billion PCs were running Windows. He also remarked: "We have lots of
room here to grow the seats with Office 365."
