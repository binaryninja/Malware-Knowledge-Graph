PIONEER KITTEN Origins
PIONEER KITTEN is an Iran-based adversary that has been active since at least 2017 and
has a suspected nexus to the Iranian government. This adversary appears to be primarily
focused on gaining and maintaining access to entities possessing sensitive information of
likely intelligence interest to the Iranian government.
Behavioral indicators and other traits suggest PIONEER KITTEN is likely a contract
element operating in support of the Iranian government, rather than one operated by the
government itself. Industry reporting has linked PIONEER KITTEN activity to multiple Iranian
adversaries; however, CrowdStrike® Intelligence considers these claims to be circumstantial
and lacking in sufficient corroborative data to enable confirmation of such relationships.
In late July 2020, an actor assessed to be associated with PIONEER KITTEN was identified
as advertising to sell access to compromised networks on an underground forum. That
activity is suggestive of a potential attempt at revenue stream diversification on the part of
PIONEER KITTEN, alongside its targeted intrusions in support of the Iranian government.
The types of entities the actor associated with PIONEER KITTEN claims to have
compromised would be of significant intelligence value to the Iranian government. As such, it
is unlikely this commercial activity by PIONEER KITTEN is sanctioned by the Iranian
government, since the commercial sale of such access would have significant negative
impacts on potential intelligence collection operations.

PIONEER KITTEN Methods
PIONEER KITTEN tradecraft is characterized by a pronounced reliance on exploits of
remote external services on internet-facing assets to achieve initial access to victims, as
well as an almost total reliance on open-source tooling during operations.
The adversary is particularly interested in exploits related to VPNs and network
appliances, including CVE-2019-11510, CVE-2019-19781, and most recently CVE-20205902; reliance on exploits such as these lends to an opportunistic operational model.
PIONEER KITTEN’s namesake operational characteristic is its reliance on SSH tunneling,
through open-source tools such as Ngrok and the adversary’s custom tool SSHMinion, for
communication with implants and hands-on-keyboard activity via Remote Desktop Protocol
(RDP).

PIONEER KITTEN’s Targets
Identified PIONEER KITTEN targeting to date has centered around North American and
Israeli entities of likely intelligence interest to the Iranian government. Target sectors include
technology, government, defense, healthcare, aviation, media, academic, engineering,

consulting and professional services, chemical, manufacturing, financial services, insurance,
and retail.
The widespread nature of PIONEER KITTEN’s target scope is likely a result of the
adversary’s opportunistic operational model; the entities apparently of most interest to the
adversary are technology, government, defense, and healthcare organizations.
