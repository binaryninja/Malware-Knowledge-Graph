Overview
Cybersecurity company ESET disclosed another Ukraine-focused wiper dubbed
"CaddyWiper" on March 14. This wiper is relatively smaller than previous wiper attacks we've
seen in Ukraine such as "HermeticWiper" and "WhisperGate," with a compiled size of just
9KB.
The wiper discovered has the same compilation timestamp day (March 14) and initial reports
suggest that it was deployed via GPO.
Cisco Talos is actively conducting analysis to confirm the details included in these reports.

Analysis
1/7

The wiper is relatively small in size and dynamically resolves most of the APIs it uses. Our
analysis didn't show any indications of persistency, self-propagation or exploitation code.
Before starting any file destruction, it checks to ensure that the machine is not a domain
controller. If the machine is a domain controller, it stops execution.

Pseudo-code: CaddyWiper checking for the Domain Controller role of the machine.
If the system is not a domain controller, the wiper will destroy files on "C:\Users," followed by
wiping of all files in the next drive letter until it reaches the "Z" drive. This means that the

2/7

wiper will also attempt to wipe any network mapped drive attached to the system.

File in drives with letters from D:\ overwritten with zeros.
This ensures that the system will not crash due to the wipe of system files.

File wiping algorithm
The file destruction algorithm is composed of two stages: a first stage to overwrite files and
another to destroy the physical disk layout and the partition tables along with it. For the file
destruction, it takes ownership of the files by modifying their ACL entries after it has obtained
the 'SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege'. A file found will then simply be overwritten with zeros.

3/7

A file that is larger than 10,485,760 bytes (0xA00000) in size will simply have the first
10,485,760 bytes overwritten with zeros.

File overwritten with a buffer consisting of zeros.
The wiper will then move on to the next drive on the system beginning with the "D" drive. It
will recursively gain rights to files on a drive and overwrite them with zeros. This is done for
the next 23 drives alphabetically (through "Z:\").
On the second stage, the wiper attempts to set the drive layout of all the physical drives on
the system numbered 9 to 0. This will wipe out all extended information about the physical
drive's partitions including MBR, GPT and partition entries.

4/7

Wiper recursively performing IOCTL_DISK_SET_DRIVE_LAYOUT_EX requests with a
zeroed out buffer.
Destroying the start of the files and the partitions tables is a common technique seen on
other wipers, and its highly effective in preventing the file recovery.
