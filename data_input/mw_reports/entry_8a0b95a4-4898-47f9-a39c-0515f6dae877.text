GandCrab Threat Actors Retire...Maybe
fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/gandcrab-threat-actors-retire.html
June 24, 2019

In a surprising announcement two weeks ago, the threat group behind the malware operation
GandCrab announced that they had shut down their operations. Until that point, GandCrab
had been one of the most active malware campaigns of the past year, both in terms of
distribution and rapid development. FortiGuard Labs has covered their progress in a series of
articles, as well as in a presentation at AVAR2018.
In an announcement as novel and cavalier as the threat actors themselves – reflecting their
public persona since they first surfaced – they have now made a grand exit by thanking their
affiliates and detailing their earnings.
They claim that their Ransom-as-a-Service (RaaS) operation had a total of $2 billion in
earnings. In a pay scheme of 60%-40% (70%-30% in some cases), giving the larger
percentage of the payments to their affiliates, they claim that they personally earned $150
million from their operations.

Arrival on the Ransomware Scene

1/4

GandCrab first appeared on exploit.in, a Russian hacking forum, on January 28, 2018, at a
time when file-encrypting malware distribution was seemingly declining. Despite this,
GandCrab was able to make a significant impact, infecting more than 50,000 victims in just
their first month of operation.
They were also notable at the time because they were the first criminal organization to only
accept DASH cryptocurrency as ransom payment, although they later decided to accept
other cryptocurrencies. They also hosted their C2s using the .BIT TLD using a centralized
DNS server (a.dnspod.com), which nominally claimed to mirror the namespace of Namecoin.
While .BIT is commonly associated with the NameCoin organization for their decentralized
DNS project, GandCrab’s association with NameCoin was later debunked by the
organization.

Aggressive Distribution
GandCrab’s aggressive distribution network was built through its affiliate program and
partnerships with other services, such as the binary crypter NTCrypt, along with other actors
with expertise in distribution through RDP and VNC. At first, they only targeted western
countries, primarily in Latin America. Later, they expanded to partnering with malware
distributors in China and South Korea, with our detection of a spam campaign delivering a
GandCrab payload targeting South Korea as recently as last April.

An Unusual But Probably Effective Marketing Tactic
Due to the rapid development of GandCrab, FortiGuard Labs as well as other security
researchers have been actively monitoring changes between releases. In addition to new
features, these have also included public stunts through novelty messages that the threat
actors embedded to their binaries as a way to taunt researchers and security organizations.
This approach created noise, which may have made them arguably one of the most covered
and talked about Ransomware families of the past year. This unusual strategy demonstrated
an almost unprecedented level of criminal bravado, and even a sense of invincibility, since
they were able to release public announcements that messed with the security community
without any repercussions.

In another unusual marketing tactic, GandCrab actors also used reports from security
companies to promote the success of their service, while mocking their adversaries.

Agile Development
Part of GandCrab’s success was due to their use of an agile development approach that
enabled rapid releases of new versions. This was best described in our article on the
development of GandCrab v4.x. A detailed discussion of the full timeline of GandCrab
development can also be found in our AVAR2018: GandCrab Mentality presentation.

Bugs, Breaches, and GandCrab’s Demise
Using this agile development approach enabled them to successfully evade detection by
many security companies. A good example of this is when Ahnlab released a vaccine tool to
prevent the malware from executing in a system by creating a file that the malware checked
before performing its encryption routine. This started a tit-for-tat between the two, which even
led to the threat actors disclosing a Denial-of-Service attack POC against one of Ahnlab’s
products. This was also discussed in our article on the GandCrab v4.x timeline.
However, GandCrab was no exception to the drawbacks of using a fast-paced development
approach, as bugs and loopholes began to be discovered in distributed versions. For
instance, in the very early versions of the malware they were using hardcoded RC4 keys to
encrypt their outbound traffic that also contained the private keys, which would have enabled
to the decryption of the victim’s ransomed files. Another simple but serious slip-up was when
they failed to set a flag when generating their RSA keys. This led to a copy of the private key
being stored locally on the victim’s system. We also discussed a bug that we found when
they first added the feature that changed the wallpaper of their victims. However, they quickly
fixed these mistakes in the next release.
But perhaps their biggest mishap – one that we believe led to their eventual demise – were
breaches to their server-side infrastructure, which led to leaks of the private keys of victims.
A month after their operation began, BitDefender, in collaboration with Europol, released a
free decryption tool for victims of GandCrab v1. At the time, there was very limited
information as to how they were able to do this – at least until the ransomware perpetrators
themselves announced that their payment page has been compromised, which we suspect
led to the creation of the decryption tool.

We believe that similar breaches eventually led to the subsequent release of the decryption
tool used to decrypt files encrypted by new versions of the malware. In fact, just two weeks
after GandCrab’s retirement announcement, BitDefender released a new version of a
decryption tool that supports the latest (v5.2) version of the malware.

Conclusion
GandCrab was a Ransomware-as-a-Service malware managed by a criminal organization
known to be confident and vocal, while running a rapidly evolving ransomware campaign.
Through their aggressive, albeit unusual, marketing strategies and constant recruitment of
affiliates, they were able to globally distribute a high volume of their malware.
However, through a recent forum post, the GandCrab team has now publicly announced the
end of a little more than a year of ransomware operations, citing staggering profit figures.
However, considering how witty and novel this threat group has been throughout the course
of their campaign, it wouldn’t be a surprise if this retirement announcement was just another
of their many public stunts. If there’s one thing that sets these threat actors apart from other
groups, it is that they are unpredictable; so there is always the possibility that they might resurface in one form or another. In the meantime, FortiGuard Labs will continue to monitor for
any new activities from this group.
