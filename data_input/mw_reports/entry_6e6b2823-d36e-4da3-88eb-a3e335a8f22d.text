Another 130.000+ installations of malicious droppers from official store
A year ago, we highlighted a trend of malicious droppers in Google Play store used to distribute banking Trojans. We also
predicted further efforts of cybercriminals to reduce the malicious footprint of their malware in order to stay undetected.
Distribution through droppers on official stores remains one of the most efficient ways for threat actors to reach a wide and
unsuspecting audience. Although other distribution methods are also used depending on cybercriminals targets, resources,
and motivation, droppers remain one of the best option on price-efforts-quality ratio, competing with SMiShing.

1/18

The history of competition between malware authors and seсurity mechanisms knows several twists when new measures
are introduced. Droppers on Google Play went from using AccessibilityService to auto-allow installation from unknown
sources to using legitimate sources to control them and store malicious payloads. Following the updates to the “Developer
Program Policy” and system updates, actors immediately introduce new ways to sneak to the official store, overcoming
limitations or adjusting droppers to follow the guidelines and not arouse suspicion. A brief story of that battle is presented
on the graph below.

In this blog we uncover additional tactics cybercriminals use in new Google Play droppers discovered by ThreatFabric
analysts. These droppers have cumulative number of 130k+ installations distributing Sharkbot and Vultur banking Trojans.

2/18

Sharkbot: the less you see, the more they get
In the beginning of October 2022 ThreatFabric analysts spotted a new campaign of banking Trojan Sharkbot, targeting
Italian banking users. This campaign involved Sharkbot version 2.29 – 2.32. Following the research path, our analysts
were able to identify the dropper app located on Google Play with 10k+ installations and disguised as an app to calculate
tax code in Italy (“Codice Fiscale”) targeting Italian users.

This is not the first time that a Sharkbot dropper sneaks into the official Google store, but this time authors did their best to
hide the malicious intents of the dropper. Previous versions of Sharkbot droppers as well as other droppers (including those
we highlight below in this blog) include ability to download, install and launch the malicious payload. Obviously, such
behaviour is quite suspicious and already made Google to introduce changes to the Developer Program Policy where
usage of REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES permission was limited to apps that have it as core functionality.
However, in this new iteration, Sharkbot dropper authors tried their best to not include suspicious permissions at all, thus
maintaining an extremely low profile. The new dropper has only 3 permissions that are quite common.

3/18

To ensure that the dropper is launched on a real targeted device, the app obtains the SIM coutry and compares it to “it”
(Italy): if not matched, no malicious activity will be performed. Besides, additional checks are made on the C2 side to
ensure that the dropper is running on the targeted device: if C2 is reached from a non-Italian IP address, the C2 will
respond with a default “exit” message. Otherwise, it will receive a configuration data with the URL containing the payload.

Here the interesting part starts: in order to avoid using REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES permission, the dropper opens a
fake Google Play store page impersonating Codice Fiscale app page. It contains fake information about the number of
installations and reviews, and urges the victim to perform an update. Shortly after the page is opened, the automatic

4/18

download starts. Thus, the dropper outsources the download and installation procedure to the browser, avoiding suspicious
permissions.

Obviously, such approach requires more actions from the victim, as the browser will show several messages about the
downloaded file. However, since victims are sure about the origin of the application, they will highly likely install and run the
downloaded Sharkbot payload.
During our investigation, we also found another Sharkbot dropper available on Google Play. It had zero installations at the
time of discovery and was quickly removed from the website. The interesting detail about this dropper was that it had the
REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES permission in place and operated more in line with usual dropper’s behaviour. Actors
were also following the updated policy of Google, as this dropper was masqueraded as file manager, a category that is
allowed to have this permission due to it being a core functionality.

5/18

Similarities in code, C2 communication, and encryption used lead us to the same author behind the older versions of
Sharkbot dropper, trying to reduce footprints and stay undetected.

Targets
The new “Codice Fiscale” dropper discovered by ThreatFabric is configured to distribute Sharkbot payload to Italian users
only, while the other “File Manager” dropper has Italy and UK in its configuration. At the same time, the payload delivered
still has banks from Italy, UK, Germany, Spain, Poland, Austria, US, and Australia in its target list. Please, find the full target
list in Appendix.

Vultur: Brunhilda is back
Another malware family that has been very active in the last year has been Vultur. First discovered by ThreatFabric in July
2021, Vultur is an Android banking trojan which specializes in stealing PII from infected devices using its screen-streaming
capabilities. It is also able to create a remote session on the device using VNC technology to perform actions on the
victim’s device, effectively leading to On-Device Fraud (ODF).
Upon discovery, ThreatFabric first reported the strong connection between this malware family, and the “Brunhilda
Project” crew. This Threat Actor was known for its central role in the distribution sector of the Android Banking malware
landscape thanks to its dropper applications, which managed often to pass Google security checks and be approved on the
Google Play Store. Initially, the Brunhilda droppers were deploying a variety of Android malware applications, like for
example samples of the malware family Alien. However, after the first discovery of Vultur, every dropper found on the
Google Play Store only installed samples belonging to the Vultur malware family.
Recently, ThreatFabric discovered 3 new Droppers on the Google Play store, ranging from 1.000 to 100.000 installations
reported by Google. As previous campaigns observed throughout 2022, these droppers pose as applications like security
authenticators, or file recovery tools.

6/18

The Dropper
The dropper applications are consistent with the droppers that we reported in our first blog about Vultur, and the modus
operandi has not changed much with respect to older variants. As usual, the dropper is made of a trojanized application,
which provides the advertised functionality, as well as the hidden dropper functionality. As previously reported, the dropper
initially sends a registration message to its C2 server. As a response, the server sends back an appToken, which is then
used in the following requests to identify the device. At this point, the dropper prompts the victim with a screen asking to
download an update for the current application. If the user accepts the displayed request, the dropper proceeds to install
Vultur.

7/18

In terms of execution of the installation, there are no real updates from previous versions of Brunhilda. However, the
dropper currently implements a few obfuscation techniques which were not present in initial versions of the dropper. Firstly,
in these new version, the installation logic is not contained in the main DEX file, but in a additional dex file which is loaded
dynamically. This additional step can complicate the life of researchers, making it harder to identify the code responsible for
malicious activity.
The latest version of Brunhilda also implemented a new layer of obfuscation, which encrypts strings by using AES with a
varying key, which is included in the byte array that is given as input to the decryption method, as explained in the picture
below:

Once the payload is installed, the Brunhilda dropper launches the malware, and then continues existing on the device,
acting as the application it is posing as.

Vultur
These Brunhilda droppers all deploy samples belonging to a novel variant of Vultur Android Banking malware family.
This new variant maintains the Modus Operandi that characterized the original samples from 2021: once installed, the
malware initiates a connection with its C2, and after registering it obtains its configuration containing its targets. Vultur
features two separate target lists: one for screen-streaming targets and one for keylogging targets. Similarly to its older
variant, the keylogging targets are social and messaging applications, while the screen-streaming targets are applications
for online banking and cryptocurrency exchange. However, in this new variant, this second set of targets is also the list of
applications for which extensive accessibility logging is performed.

8/18

By accessibility logging we mean the extensive logging of all UI elements and all the events associated with them (like for
example clicks, gestures, etc). This is not a novel technique, but it is the first time we see it implemented in Vultur. This
might be a solution to the issue created by a security flag often used in these banking applications: Android offers a way to
tag the content of the window as secure, by using the “FLAG_SECURE”, which prevents it “from appearing in screenshots
or from being viewed on non-secure displays”. ThreatFabric tested this and is able to confirm that windows with this flag
enabled only show a black screen during screen-streaming. However, if the keyboard is opened during interaction with
the secured app, it will be visible on the recording as well as all the keys pressed by victim leading to potential theft of
input data. In this case, it is possible to obtain enough information to steal credentials even with a black screen, when all
the UI events are logged and sent to the C2.

9/18

In our previous blog we documented through our research why we believe that Vultur, the malware downladed by these
droppers, is a malware family that is not only distributed, but also created by the criminals behind the Brunhilda Project. In
addition to the reasons discussed in our previous blog, which focus on the networking protocol used, new variants of Vultur
also adopted the very same string obfuscation algorithm discussed in the previous section about the Brunhilda Dropper,
further confirming our beliefs about the connection between these two malware families.

Targets
These new Brunhilda-Vultur campaigns have been very active and successful in the last few months, reaching more than
100.000 potential fraud victims. Based on our research and investigation, in addition to cryptowallets which have always
been in the target list, the largest campaign we observed focused on UK and Netherlands, while the two smaller and more
recent ones switched to Germany, France, and Italy. Full target list of Vultur is provided in Appendix.

Conclusion
Another trend predicted by ThreatFabric’s experts comes true and looks like it is here to stay. Malicious dropper
applications still find their way to sneak in the official store despite the changes made to the policy and security
mechanisms. Distibution through droppers on Google Play still remains the most “affordable” and scalable way of reaching
victims for most of the actors of different level. While sophisticated tactics like telephone-oriented attack delivery require
more resources and are hard to scale, droppers on official and third-party stores allow threat actors to reach wide
unsuspecting audience with reasonable efforts. Such way of distribution of Android banking Trojans is very dangerous as
victims may stay unsuspecting for a long time and may not alert their bank about suspicious transactions made without
them knowlege. Thus it is very important to take actions on the organisation side to detect such malicous apps and their
payloads as well as suspicious behaviour happenning on customer’s device.
We at ThreatFabric always report malicous droppers we indentified to remove it from official stores and limit its further
distribution. Financial organisations are welcome to contact us: if you suspect some app be involved in malicious activity,
feel free to reach our Mobile Threat Intelligence team which will provide additional details and help with reporting the
malicous app if identified: mti@threatfabric.com.
