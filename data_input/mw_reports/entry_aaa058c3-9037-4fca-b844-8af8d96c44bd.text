We have been following an evolving phishing campaign that targets high-ranking company
executives since May 2020. The attackers reuse compromised hosts for the phishing pages
targeting organizations in the manufacturing, real estate, finance, government, and
technological industries in several countries such as Japan, the United States, UK, Canada,
Australia, and Europe. As of this writing, we found over 300 unique compromised URLs and
70 email addresses from eight compromised sites, including 40 legitimate emails of company
CEOs, directors, owners, and founders, among other enterprise employee targets. We are
now working with the respective authorities for further investigation.
Luring victims with compromised infrastructure
We observed the attackers targeting potential victims with emails containing fake Office 365
password expiration reports as lures. They prompt the targets to click the embedded link in

the email if they want to continue using the same password; choosing the “Keep Password”
option leads the user to the phishing page.

lure.
The attackers are reusing compromised infrastructure and victims’ account credentials to
host phishing pages and gain more victims, as briefly reported last year. The kit, which is
available for sale, can validate the credentials’ details and accuracy once the victim interacts
with the embedded link.
Related to this, during examination of underground activities we identified several
advertisements by cybercriminals selling account credentials of CEOs, chief financial officers
(CFOs), and finance department members, among others. Those posts were seen in multiple

2/21

English- and Russian-speaking forums, including an underground forum that seemingly
matched with another user’s . Notably, all posts on the Russian-speaking forums were done
in English and using recently registered accounts. We observed these users offering
compromised MS Office 365 account credentials and the employees’ respective company
positions.

Phishing kit
The campaign orchestrators used the same phishing kit during the campaigns. We observed
that some of the sites that hosted the phishing kit were not configured properly. This exposed
content of the directory, allowing the download of the phishing kit and associated log files
without authentication. This also allowed us to get additional insights on the campaign and
find evidence for potential attribution of the kits in their different deployment locations.
This discovery led us to believe that the kit developer’s previous projects served as precursor
features that contributed to the Office 365 phishing kit versions subsequently sold in the
underground. However, as we further examined the developer’s profile, we found odd
behaviors that may warrant further technical and legal investigation.

information).
Emailing using third-party RDP
We looked at the email headers of the lure email samples, examined the SMTP headers,
and found an interesting detail: most of the phishing emails were sent using a virtual private
server (VPS) from FireVPS.
from FireVPS-RDP (XX.X.XXX.XX) by
from FireVPS-RDP (XXX.XXX.XX.XXX) by
from FireVPS-RDP (XX.XXX.XXX.XX) by
OL1P279CA0064.NORP279.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM (2603:10a6:e10:15::15) with
Microsoft SMTP

FireVPS is a virtual private server (VPS) offering a range of Windows remote desktop
protocol (RDP) plans for their respective customers. The emails sent to the victims are sent
from the RDP service. We have alerted FireVPS of this and have yet to hear from them.
While scanning other email samples for emails sent from a FireVPS-RDP machine, we found
similar phishing email templates and the URL that was sent to a financial department
member also contained the recipient’s information and credentials. An online search
4/21

revealed that the recipient’s profile and email address matched the accurate information
listed on his LinkedIn account.
Phishing kit blocklist
We think the phishing kit developer spent considerable time compiling the blocklist included
in the kit. It uses an extensive list of domain names and IP address ranges to ensure that
access is blocked when accessed by security companies or large cloud providers. We
assume the intention is to evade detection by security vendors as the list includes a number
of antivirus companies; Google, Microsoft, VirusTotal, and a long list of other cybersecurity
and technology companies, as well as public blocklisting sites.

Figure 5. The phishing kit developer made an effort to add specific IP addresses to a
blocklist evade detection.
Keeping this in mind, we find it ironic that the kit developer would take this much time to
create a blocklist while actively marketing the kit on social network site(s).
Previous versions of the phishing kit
The phishing kit we observed in this campaign is the fourth iteration of the toolkit. Previous
versions were noticed and are known to the cybersecurity community, since it was widely
advertised in the underground and on social media.
According to the malware developer’s “business” Facebook page, the first version of the
phishing kit was released on July 4, 2019, shortly followed by the second version (V2) 15
days after. The third version (V3) was not officially announced on the Facebook page but
was observed to be in circulation and could be found through a simple online search.

Figure 7. V2 and V3 of the phishing kit were reported in previous months and known among
cybersecurity researchers.
Most of the lure’s content theme focuses on prompting the victims to keep their current
passwords. A look at the campaigns' pattern shows that the first layer of the phishing link
includes the recipient’s email domain in the compromised URLs' subdomain, followed by the
7/21

Base64 encoded string of the recipient’s email. (The email does not always have to be
base64 encoded, we also have seen landing pages with email being included in plaintext).
As the user chooses the link to keep their password, they are redirected to the phishing
pages. We noticed that the current version the compromised URLs’ landing pages started
including the keyword “OfficeV4” in August.
By September, the victims’ domain names were still included, but the prefixes were changed
from “sg” to “pl,” “00,” and/or “ag.” In another development in October, the victim’s names
were being included in the subdomain instead of the respective domain names.

Notable features of the latest phishing kit

8/21

Aside from the blocklist, V4’s other features supposedly make the detection of this kit harder.
Among them the capability to detect bot scanning or crawling attempts, and provide
alternative content when bots are detected. Below are some of the features of V4 as listed by
the kit developer on his Facebook page.

Figure 10. Features of the Office365 V4 phishing kit, as posted on social media.
Furthermore, the phishing kit is sold with a license, and the obfuscated PHP script calls back
to the developer’s system to verify the license’s validity. The phishing page calls back to the
license server to check the license key's availability, and a URL/IP to access the license
server is seen in config.PHP. Interestingly, config.PHP file is readable on an actual phishing
site and contains the license key and the email address in it.

We continue to study the features of this phishing campaign to track the current and potential
developments this routine may further include, and to anticipate the changes in its evasion
techniques.

Tracking the kit developer

The alleged developer of Office365 announced the V4 phishing kit’s availability on their
“business” Facebook page in mid-2020.

We also observed logs of test traffic from the phishing kit one day before the announcement
of V4, wherein almost all logs recorded were from different IP addresses from Morocco.

Figure 14. Access logs allowed us to determine the IP addresses used the day before the
announcement. The top five IP addresses used were tracked to Morocco.
Several days after the announcement of the V4’s availability, we found an email lure sample;
a look at the details of the header revealed that it matched the phishing samples we saw in
November and December.

Looking further at the previous posts in the account also revealed announcements that
claimed the user responsible for the fake Office 365 versions as the developer of other
credential harvesting kits. While no longer available, the latter kit was capable of rapidly
verifying the validity of email addresses; it could have been a predecessor project that
potentially contributed to the features of the phishing kit versions sold. Based on other posts
on the actor’s social media page, this user also continues to sell harvested credentials aside
from the phishing kit itself.

current phishing kit’s features
We were able to match the cybercriminal’s business Facebook page to personal pages while
scanning for information online. We have informed the appropriate authorities of these
details for this investigation.
Possible link to online sellers of C-level accounts

13/21

There are numerous users in underground forums selling C-Level accounts. We identified
these user handles as sellers of some relevant C-level accounts across different forums,
pricing these credentials ranging from $250 to $500.

forums

We found it interesting that the user mentioned the published article regarding selling C-level
credentials and requests to deal only with users or customers he had previous transactions
with. New customers are automatically prohibited from viewing the list of affected companies
and credentials. The user also sells a phishing routine targeting servers and identifies its
features such as cookie capture and multi-factor authentication bypass. Interestingly, the
same handle sells both; the tool for credential harvesting and (two) collected accounts are
priced approximately the same, similar to the alleged phishing kit developer’s offers on social
media.

Potential targets and victims’ data
16/21

Analysis of the data from the misconfigured sites’ collected log files revealed that the stolen
credentials came from eight compromised phishing sites hosting the malicious Office 365 V4
kit as of this writing. We found each site to be possibly made by different phishers for
different phishing campaigns of varying scale and scope. One campaign targeted only
company CEOs, presidents, and founders in the US, while another campaign targeted
directors and managers from various countries such as the US, UK, Canada, Hungary, the
Netherlands, and Israel. In addition, it appeared that the phishers mostly collected targeted
email addresses from LinkedIn.

Figure 19. Country distribution of victims
Based on the data distribution, CEOs in the US are obviously the main targets of the threat
actors that use the Office 365 V4 phishing kit. In the underground markets, CEO email
address lists are often sold and bought for the purpose of conducting additional phishing
attacks, gaining access to sensitive information or conducting other social engineering
attacks, such as business email compromise (BEC) and impersonation.
A look at different underground forums and pages also revealed specific offers for
compromised credentials which are categorized according to year, industry, company
position, and social media platform credentials. In addition, the forum messages were written
in English, even in non-English forums such as those catering to Russian-speaking users
and groups. While not uncommon, the accounts were notably created to post those specific
messages selling the data and phishing kit to potential customers. This is emphasized in one
forum where the actor bought an account for use in one of the forums just to sell data.
To start a target list, there are a number of platforms available that sell lists of CFO/CEO
emails, Facebook profiles and more, categorized by region and country. The attackers could
have purchased target lists from one of these websites.

Conclusion
Phishing attacks and attackers often target employees — usually the weakest link in an
organization’s security chain. As seen in this particular campaign, the attackers target high
profile employees who may not be as technically or cybersecurity savvy, and may be more
likely to be deceived into clicking on malicious links. By selectively targeting C-level
employees, the attacker significantly increases the value of obtained credentials as they
could lead to further access to sensitive personal and organizational information, and used in
other attacks.
The scale and accuracy of the emails and credentials show that the attacker possesses an
accurate dataset of victims and potential targets. While the attacker could have simply
compiled the emails from the targeted organizations’ websites, they went a step further to
validate these to make sure it complements data collected from the public domain.
While organizations are aware and wary of the information they include in public-facing
websites and platforms, their respective employees should be constantly reminded to be
mindful of the details they disclose on personal pages. These can be easily used against
them for attacks using social engineering techniques. All employees, regardless of company
rank, should exercise caution when reviewing and acting on email prompts for specific
actions, especially from unknown sources.
Considering this, legitimate service providers and vendors will never ask individual
consumers and enterprise users for details such as account access credentials, and
especially not to retain dated passwords. These details are susceptible to abuse among
unauthorized and malicious individuals and are left for customization by vendors to
respective security and IT teams following organizational policies.
