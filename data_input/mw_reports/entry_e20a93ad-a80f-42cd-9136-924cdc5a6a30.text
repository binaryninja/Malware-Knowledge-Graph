Chemical distribution company Brenntag paid a $4.4 million ransom in Bitcoin to the
DarkSide ransomware gang to receive a decryptor for encrypted files and prevent the threat
actors from publicly leaking stolen data.
Brenntag is a world-leading chemical distribution company headquartered in Germany but
with over 17,000 employees worldwide at over 670 sites.
According to the ICS Top 100 Chemical Distributors report, Brenntag is the second largest in
sales for North America.

At the beginning of May, Brenntag suffered a ransomware attack that targeted their North
America division. As part of this attack, the threat actors encrypted devices on the network
and stole unencrypted files.
From the information shared with BleepingComputer by an anonymous source, the DarkSide
ransomware group claimed to have stolen 150GB of data during their attack.
To prove their claims, the ransomware gang created a private data leak page containing a
description of the types of data that were stolen and screenshots of some of the files.

Private data leak page sent to Brenntag
DarkSide initially demanded a 133.65 Bitcoin ransom, valued at approximately $7.5 million at
the time. However, after negotiations, BleepingComputer was told that the ransom demand
was decreased to $4.4 million, which was paid two days ago.
From the bitcoin address shared with BleepingComputer, we confirmed that Brenntag sent
the ransom to the attackers on May 11th.
Today, Brenntag shared a statement with BleepingComputer confirming that they suffered a
security incident but did not outright state it was a ransomware attack.
"Brenntag North America is currently working to resolve a limited information security
incident," Brenntag told BleepingComputer.
"As soon as we learned of this incident, we disconnected affected systems from the network
to contain the threat."

"In addition, third-party cybersecurity and forensic experts were immediately engaged to help
investigate. We also informed law enforcement of this incident."

Gained access through stolen credentials
DarkSide is a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) operation, which is when the ransomware
developers partner with third-party affiliates, or hackers, who are responsible for gaining
access to a network and encrypting devices.
As part of this arrangement, the core DarkSide team earns 20-30% of a ransom payment,
and the rest goes to the affiliate who conducted the attack.
One of the conditions for most ransomware negotiations is that the affiliate discloses how
they gained access to a victim's network. This could come in the form of a multi-page
security audit report or simply a simple paragraph in the Tor chat screen explaining how they
gained access.
In this particular case, the DarkSide affiliate claims to have gotten access to the network after
purchasing stolen credentials. However, the DarkSide affiliate does not know how the
credentials were originally obtained.

DarkSide says they purchase credentials for the network
Ransomware gangs and other threat actors commonly use dark web marketplace to
purchase stolen credentials, especially those for Remote Desktop credentials.
Last month, BleepingComputer reported how one of the largest RDP marketplaces, UAS,
suffered a breach showing that over the past three years they had access to 1.3 million
stolen credentials.
While this was an expensive lesson, and unfortunately all-too-common, the attack illustrates
the importance of enforcing multi-factor authentication for all logins on a network and putting
all Remote Desktop servers behind a VPN.
If MFA was enabled for account logins, it is unlikely that the DarkSide affiliate would have
gained access to the network.
