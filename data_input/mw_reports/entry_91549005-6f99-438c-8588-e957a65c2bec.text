THE BUSINESS OF FRAUD:

Botnet Malware Dissemination

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS

Recorded Future analyzed current data from the Recorded Future®
Platform, as well as dark web and open-source intelligence (OSINT)
sources, to review botnets (“not-auto buy” botnets) that facilitate
nefarious activities by threat actors. This report expands upon findings
outlined in “The Business of Fraud: An Overview of How Cybercrime
Gets Monetized”. It will be of most interest to anti-fraud and network
defenders, security researchers, and executives charged with security
and fraud risk management and mitigation.

Executive Summary
Botnets are networks of computers infected by
malware (such as computer viruses, keyloggers, and
other malicious software) that are controlled remotely
by online threat actors to garner financial gain or
to launch attacks on websites or networks. When a
computer is infected by a botnet, it communicates and
receives instructions from command-and-control (C2)
computers located around the globe. Many botnets are
designed to harvest data, such as passwords or phrases,
Social Security numbers (SSNs), credit card numbers,
addresses, telephone numbers, and other personally
identifiable information (PII). The data is then used for
nefarious purposes, such as identity theft, credit card
fraud, spamming or phishing, website attacks, and
malware distribution.

Key Judgments
• While IcedID has surged in spam volume,
TrickBot and QakBot have shown much more
consistency in the volume of spam and infection
traffic pertaining to fraud purposes since
Emotet’s takedown.
• Financially motivated threat actors, nation-state
actors, and APTs in various international regions
will continue to use botnets for fraudulent
purposes to attack targets.
• Underground forum courses on how to best use
botnets will remain popular among threat actors
for the foreseeable future, particularly as the
world becomes increasingly digitized.

Threat Analysis
In a report published by the International Data
Corporation (IDC), researchers predict that “by 2025
there will be 55.7 billion connected devices worldwide,
75% of which will be connected to an IoT platform”.
According to a recent report conducted by Barracuda
Research in September 2021, bots make up nearly twothirds of internet traffic, with malicious bots making
up nearly 40% of all traffic. In today’s cyber threat
landscape, the term “bot” is used widely to describe
automated processes for both legal and malicious
purposes, with examples of these terminologies below:
• Spambot: An application designed to gather
email addresses from a variety of websites,
adding them to lists to send unwanted emails.
• Ticket/auto-buy bot: an application that
automatically buys commodities (such as tickets
or retail items), especially commodities that
have limited or special releases. The operators
of these botnets are usually motivated to resell
items at higher prices on the secondary market.
• Social media bot: an application that specifically
operates on social networks to post and
amplify messages, infiltrate groups, create fake
accounts, collect postings, and more. Russian
agents successfully deployed social media bots
before the 2016 US Presidential election to stir
resentment and spread disinformation.
• Botnet: an infected machine that is controlled
by a threat actor via a command and control
(C2) serve with the intent of using the machine
(usually with other infected machines) to launch
network disruptions (DDoS), injection malware,
harvest credentials (as in Genesis Store listings),
and other nefarious purposes.
For this report, we will focus on how cybercriminals
use botnets to facilitate their fraudulent activities.

Chinese

On September 1, 2021, the Record reported that Chinese
authorities had arrested the authors of the Mozi Internet
of Things (IoT) botnet. At its peak, the Mozi botnet infected
160,000 systems/day in September 2020 and had historically
infected more than 1.5 million different devices, with more than
half of them located inside China. The botnet also used the DHT
protocol to create a P2P system between all the infected devices,
allowing bots to send updates and operational instructions to
each other directly, which also permitted Mozi to continue
to operate even without a central C2 server. For this reason,
researchers believe it will take months for the botnet to die
out. In addition, prior to their arrests, new features were added
to the Mozi module which enabled cryptocurrency mining on
infected systems in an attempt to monetize the botnet beyond
DDoS attacks.
Scripts and tutorials for cryptocurrency mining that uses

The use of IoT technology on a network can greatly reduce
operational costs, mitigate system issues, and improve acrossthe-board efficiencies. However, this innovation comes with
unique security risks often resulting from attempts to combine
this technology with legacy systems already functioning within
a host environment. Among these risks to IoT systems include:
• A lack of uniform security standards in the maintenance
of this technology
• Their utilization by building or facility managers rather
than security professionals
• Their diverse irregularly secured attack surface allows
threat actors potential access to company servers
storing personal, proprietary, or financial data.
As society continues to place a large emphasis on making
technology more efficient, both from a customer standpoint and
an operational perspective, there continue to be security risks
as modern technology is leveraged for convenience purposes
rather than focusing on the end-to-end security of technologies
they are utilizing.

Botnets Training: Inside the Bot-Herders School
In addition to the above botnet activities, Insikt Group
analysts have identified dark web threat actors offering botnetrelated services, including tutorials and lessons on how to use
botnets in targeting victims. Since 2019, the Russian-language
underground forum OpenCard has been offering a training
course on botnets and bot-herders. OpenCard forum operates
as a marketplace and discussion board focused on carding,
e-commerce fraud, and money laundering. According to the
course authors, “bot-herders are operators of botnets who use
malware to break into computers and computer networks to form
a botnet for personal gain and malicious purposes”.

These security measures include:

• Protect sensitive files using strong, complex passwords.

• Ensuring that device firmware remains current and up to
date at all times
• Integrating a virtual private network service
• Ensuring that the default manufacturer passwords are
immediately changed upon acquiring a new device and
that any existing devices within your enterprise that
contain default credentials are immediately adjusted
• Ensuring that all ports unnecessary to the function of the
device in question are closed
We proactively detect new botnet C2 servers to help
clients prevent infections in their enterprises. We recommend
automatically ingesting these servers for detection in firewall
and IDS appliances and running them over SIEM logs to correlate
infections. This includes proactive detections for all of the botnet
families mentioned in this reporting.

Outlook
The takedown attempt against TrickBot in the fall of 2020,
and the successful takedown of Emotet in January 2021, have
convinced botnet operators of the need to diversify. We expect
botnet operators to continue to separate their operational
infrastructure among affiliates to maintain their revenue streams.
They will very likely continue to update their payloads with new
packers, obfuscation techniques, and delivery tools, as they
have always done, but they will likely apply those stealthy habits
to their infrastructure as well. Continually evolving botnets will
represent an ongoing threat to multiple industries due to their
growing capability to not only disrupt, but to permanently render
devices and services inoperable. Recorded Future has continued
to see a growing level of technical sophistication among multiple
threat groups, with entities backed by foreign governments
demonstrating through their actions an interest in leveraging
botnets to target critical infrastructure in both public and private
sectors as well as SCADA/ICS devices.
