The Necurs botnet, which was responsible for millions of malicious spam messages last
year, has recently been extremely active again. For the past three weeks it has spammed
emails with a malicious PDF attachment that drops a word document with a macro that, in
turn, downloads rebranded ransomware. The chart below, which is data from our Spam
Research Database, shows the daily spam received from the previous weeks to present. In
typical Necurs fashion, you can see the short high volume bursts.

The campaign uses various subjects in the spammed emails.

The PDF campaigns have been evolving, almost daily. Recent documents have a larger
number of embedded files inside the pdf. These additional files do nothing, and are
probably just decoys. But the main.docm file, with its malicious macro, still acts as the
malware downloader. Below you can see how the Trustwave Secure Email Gateway sees
these messages. Note the docm file with its vbaProject macro component.
1st and 2nd Week

3rd Week

3/8

Saving and opening the PDF attachment, as shown below, has an exportDataObject
Launch instruction to open the embedded .docm file

The PDF File will drop and launch the embedded .docm file

If the macro is enabled, it will start to download a malicious file from URL which is the Jaff
Ransomware. The table below shows differences from variants from week to week:
1st and 2nd Week

3rd Week

Dropped ransom notes on every folder that it encrypted
files in it, the image file was also used as a desktop
wallpaper once ransomware done encrypting your files.

README_TO_DECRYPTl.txt

Encrypted files will have an appended file extension

{Original FileName}.wlu

Even though the appearance is different, both variants
have the same URL where you are able to recover your
encrypted files.

Earlier versions asks for 2.01 BTC and later versions it
only asks for 0.31 BTC

To conclude Necurs is a large botnet and when active it distributes massive volumes of
malicious spam. As observed, it tends to take breaks on weekends and it currently has an
ongoing campaign using malicious PDFs to download Jaff ransomware. These malicious
PDFs are continuously evolving by adding more layers of embedded files and obfuscation.
The Trustwave Secure Email Gateway can recognize and block this threat.
