FireEye Email Security recently encountered various phishing campaigns, mostly in the
Americas and Europe, using source code obfuscation with compromised or bad domains.
These domains were masquerading as authentic websites and stole personal information
such as credit card data. The stolen information was then shared to cross-platform, cloudbased instant messaging applications.
Coming off a busy holiday season with a massive surge in deliveries, this post highlights a
phishing campaign involving a fake DHL tracking page. While phishing attacks targeting
users of shipping services is not new, the techniques used in these examples are more
complex than what would be found in an off-the-shelf phishing kit.
This campaign uses a WOFF-based substitution cypher, localization specific targeting, and
various evasion techniques which we unravel here in this blog.
Attack Flow
The attack starts with an email imitating DHL, as seen in Figure 1. The email tries to trick the
recipient into clicking on a link, which would take them to a fake DHL website. In Figure 2, we
can see the fake page asking for credit card details that, if submitted, would give the user a
generic response while in the background the credit card data is shared with the attackers.

This DHL phishing campaign uses a rare technique for obfuscating its source page. The
page source contains proper strings, valid tags, and appropriate formatting, but contains
encoded text that would render gibberish without decoding prior to loading the page, as seen
in Figure 3. Typically, decoding such text is done by including script functions within the
code. Yet in this case, the decoding functions are not contained in the script.

The decoding is done by a Web Open Font Format (WOFF) font file, which happens upon
loading the page in a browser and will not be visible in the page content itself. Figure 4
shows the substitution cipher method and the WOFF font file. The attacker does this to
evade detection by security vendors. Many security vendors use static or regex signaturebased rules, so this method will break those naïve-based conditions.

Loading this custom font which decodes the text is done inside the Cascading Style Sheets
(CSS). This technique is rare as JavaScript functions are traditionally used to encrypt and
decrypt HTML text.

Figure 5 shows the CSS file used to load the WOFF font file. We have also seen the same
CSS file, style.css, being hosted on the following domains:
hxxps://www.lifepointecc[.]com/wp-content/sinin/style.css
hxxps://candyman-shop[.]com/auth/DHL_HOME/style.css
hxxps://mail.rsi-insure[.]com/vendor/ship/dhexpress/style.css
hxxps://www.scriptarticle[.]com/thro/HOME/style.css
These legitimate-looking domains are not hosting any phishing websites as of now; instead,
they appear to be a repository for attackers to use in their phishing campaigns. We have
seen similar phishing attacks targeting the banking sector in the past, but this is newer for
delivery websites.
Notable Techniques
7/15

Localization

The phishing page displays the local language based on the region of the targeted user. The
localization code (Figure 6) supports major languages spoken in Europe and the Americas
such as Spanish, English, and Portuguese.

The backend contains PHP resource files for each supported language (Figure 7), which are
picked up dynamically based on the user’s IP address location.

Evasion

This campaign employs a variety of techniques to evade detection. This will not serve up a
phishing page if the request came from certain blocked IP addresses. The backend code
(Figure 8) served the users with a "HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden" response header under the
following conditions:
IP has been seen five times (AntiBomb_User func)
IP host resolves to its list of avoided host names ('google', 'Altavista', 'Israel', 'M247',
'barracuda', 'niw.com.au' and more) (AntiBomb_WordBoot func)
IP is on its own local blocklist csv (x.csv in the kit) (AntiBomb_Boot func)
IP has seen POSTing three times (AntiBomb_Block func)

After looking at the list of blocked hosts, we could deduce that the attackers were trying to
block web crawlers.
Data Theft

The attackers behind this phishing campaign attempted to steal credentials, credit card data,
and other sensitive information. The stolen data is sent to email addresses and Telegram
channels controlled by the attacker. We uncovered a Telegram channel where data is being
sent using the Telegram Bot API shown in Figure 9.

Chat log

Figure 9: Chat log
While using php mail() function to send stolen credentials is quite common, in the near past,
encrypted instant messaging applications such as Telegram have been used for sending
phished information back to command and control servers.
We were able to access one of the Telegram channels controlled by the attacker as shown in
Figure 10. The sensitive information being sent in the chat includes IP addresses and credit
card data.

Conclusion
Attackers (and especially phishers) are always on the hunt for new ways to evade detection
by security products. Obfuscation gives the attackers an edge, and makes it harder for
security vendors to protect their customers.
By using instant messaging applications, attackers get user data in real time and victims
have little to respond once their personal information is compromised.
Indicators of Compromise (IOC)
FireEye Email Security utilizing FAUDE (FireEye Advanced URL Detection Engine) protects
customers from these types of phishing threats. Unlike traditional anti-phishing techniques
dependent on static inspection of phishing URL content, FAUDE uses multiple artificial
intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) engines to more effectively thwart these attacks.
From December 2020 until the time of posting, our FAUDE detection engine saw more than
100 unique URLs hosting DHL phishing pages with obfuscated source code, including:
