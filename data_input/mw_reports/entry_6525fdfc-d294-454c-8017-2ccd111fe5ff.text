Iranian targeting of IT sector on the rise

November 18, 2021

Iranian threat actors are increasing attacks against IT services companies as a way to access their
customers’ networks. This activity is notable because targeting third parties has the potential to
exploit more sensitive organizations by taking advantage of trust and access in a supply chain.
Microsoft has observed multiple Iranian threat actors targeting the IT services sector in attacks that
aim to steal sign-in credentials belonging to downstream customer networks to enable further attacks.
The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) and Digital Security Unit (DSU) assess this is part
of a broader espionage objective to compromise organizations of interest to the Iranian regime.
Until July 2021, Microsoft had observed relatively little history of Iranian actors attacking Indian
targets. As India and other nations rise as major IT services hubs, more nation state actors follow the
supply chain to target these providers’ public and private sector customers around the world matching
nation state interests.
To date this year, Microsoft has issued more than 1,600 notifications to over 40 IT companies in
response to Iranian targeting, compared to 48 notifications in 2020, making this a significant increase
from years past (Figure 1). The focus of several Iranian threat groups on the IT sector particularly
spiked in the last six months – roughly 10-13% of our notifications were related to Iranian threat
activity in the last six months, compared to two and a half percent in the six months prior (Figure 2).

Most of the targeting is focused on IT services companies based in India, as well as several
companies based in Israel and United Arab Emirates. Although different in technique from other
recent supply chain attacks, these attacks represent another example of how nation state actors are
increasingly targeting supply chains as indirect vectors to achieve their objectives.

emerging, or a developing cluster of threat activity, allowing MSTIC to track it as a unique set of
information until we reach a high confidence about the origin or identity of the actor behind the
activity. Once it meets the criteria, a DEV is converted to a named actor.

Observed activity
In July 2021, a group that MSTIC tracks as DEV-0228 and assesses as based in Iran compromised a
single Israel-based IT company that provides business management software. Based on MSTIC’s
assessment, DEV-0228 used access to that IT company to extend their attacks and compromise
downstream customers in the defense, energy, and legal sectors in Israel. In September, we detected
a separate Iranian group, DEV-0056, compromising email accounts at a Bahrain-based IT integration
company that works on IT integration with Bahrain Government clients, who were likely DEV-0056’s
ultimate target. DEV-0056 also compromised various accounts at a partially government-owned
organization in the Middle East that provide information and communications technology to the
defense and transportation sectors, which are targets of interest to the Iranian regime. DEV-0056
maintained persistence at the IT integration organization through at least October.
MSTIC detected a significant increase in these and other Iranian groups targeting IT companies
based in India beginning in mid-August. From mid-August to late September, we issued 1,788 nation
state notifications (NSNs) across Iranian actors to enterprise customers in India, roughly 80% of
which were to IT companies, an exponential rise from the 10 notifications we issued the previous
three years in response to previous Iranian targeting. Iranian cyber actors have rarely targeted India,
and the lack of pressing geopolitical issues that would have prompted such a shift suggests that this
targeting is for indirect access to subsidiaries and clients outside India.

Credential theft leads to downstream compromise
DEV-0228 dumped credentials from the on-premises network of an IT provider based in Israel in early
July. Over the next two months, the group compromised at least a dozen other organizations, several
of which have strong public relations with the compromised IT company. MSTIC assesses at least
four (4) of those victims were compromised using the acquired credentials and access from the IT
company in the July and August attacks. Here are two such examples:
DEV-0228 operators compromised the on-premises network of a law firm in Israel in August
through an account managed by the IT provider via PAExec (a custom version of the Windows
Sysinternals tool PsExec).
Pa.exe

\\###.##.#.## -u {user name}\{domain name} -p "********" -s cmd.exe

DEV-0228 operators also compromised a defense company in Israel by signing into an email
account provisioned for the same IT provider on the victim’s Office 365 tenant. The attackers
likely obtained those credentials from the initial compromise of the IT provider in July.

Custom implant to establish persistence
DEV-0228 operators used a custom implant to establish persistence on victim hosts and then
dumped LSASS. The implant is a custom remote access Trojan (RAT) that uses Dropbox as a
command and control (C2) channel and is disguised as RuntimeBroker.exe or svchost.exe.

Operators staged their tools in a C:\Windows\TAPI directory on the victim hosts:
C:\Windows\TAPI\lsa.exe
C:\Windows\TAPI\pa.exe
C:\Windows\TAPI\pc.exe (procdump)
C:\Windows\TAPI\Rar.exe
Microsoft will continue to monitor DEV-0228 and DEV-0056 activity and implement protections for our
customers. The current detections, advanced detections, and IOCs in place across our security
products are detailed below.

Recommended defenses
The following guidance can mitigate the techniques described in the threat activity:
Enable multi-factor authentication to mitigate compromised credentials.
For Office 365 users, see multi-factor authentication support.
For Consumer and Personal email accounts, see how to use two-step verification.
Use passwordless solutions like Microsoft Authenticator to secure accounts.
Review and enforce recommended Exchange Online access policies.
Block ActiveSync clients from bypassing Conditional Access policies.
Block all incoming traffic from anonymizing services where possible.
Turn on the following attack surface reduction rule to block or audit activity associated with this
threat:
Block credential stealing from the Windows local security authority subsystem (lsass.exe)
