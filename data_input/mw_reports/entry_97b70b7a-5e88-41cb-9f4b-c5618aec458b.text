The Sodinokibi Chronicles: A (R)Evil Cybercrime Gang Disrupts Organizations for Trade
Secrets and Cash

Incident Response April 28, 2021

It likes big game hunting, it enjoys deploying Cobalt Strike and it dabbles in critical
vulnerability abuse. It’s known as Sodinokibi/REvil, a ransomware strain that emerged in
2019 as the heir to the GandCrab ransomware, a malware family that supposedly retired
from the cyber crime arena in mid-2019 after reportedly amassing illicit profits of over $2
billion.
In the two years of its existence, Sodinokibi has gained considerable momentum, having
been implicated in high-profile cyberattacks, locking up and even auctioning off data that
belonged to companies like Travelex, Gunnebo, Brown-Forman, Asian retail giant The Dairy
Farm Group and, most recently, an Apple supplier. The demand in each case is often
exorbitant, asking victims for multi-million-dollar ransoms for their data:
Leading cosmetics group Pierre Fabre: $25,000,000
The Dairy Farm Group: $30,000,000
New York-based law firm Grubman Shire Meiselas & Sacks: $42,000,000
Apple MacBook supplier: $50,000,000
Is Sodinokibi all about the money? It’s hard to say. In some cases, Sodinokibi actors manage
to target defense contractors and organizations in countries that rival their assumed
originating state, Russia.
Robbing terabytes of data, with no way for victims to know what they actually do with it after
they receive payment, it’s very plausible that money is just one objective, followed by
espionage, both business and nation-state driven. Not unlike other major cybercrime gangs,
the group’s access and control over major organizations’ assets can lend it the power to
collaborate on a variety of nefarious schemes, including adversarial nation-state activity.

‘Cryptoviral Extortion’ Is the Name of the Game
Threat actors that use ransomware are taking advantage of the inherent power of public key
infrastructure cryptology to encrypt information in a way that’s hard or impossible to break.
The term “cryptoviral extortion” was coined in 1996 in an Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers (IEEE) paper. The IEEE also predicted that cryptoviral extortion would
one day demand ‘e-money,’ long before Bitcoin even existed.
For the cryptographic basis of the attack, Sodinokibi uses a combination of elliptic curve
Diffie-Hellman (ECDH), Salsa20, SHA-3 and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to
encrypt and decrypt both malicious configuration data and user data (i.e., user files). It
generates its private-public key pair using Curve25519, one of the fastest elliptic-curve
cryptography (ECC) curves designed for use with the ECDH key agreement scheme.

Sodinokibi operators may steal data in advance and then resort to extortion tactics that
exceed the ability of the malware itself. Those who refuse to pay up, relying on their ability to
recover data, will then receive threats to have that data exposed on an auction site the group
calls The Happy Blog. That’s also where it names and shames its victims, offering up
information that could be of use to other criminals or even competitors.
Additionally, in an interview given by an alleged REvil operator, known as Unknown, the
person said he/she was considering launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks
on victim organizations as yet another way to increase the pressure on victims to pay the
ransom.
In terms of prevalence in the wild, Sodinokibi made up 22% of all X-Force incident response
engagements in 2020, suggesting that those operating this malware are more skilled at
gaining access to victims’ networks when compared to other ransomware strains. XForce estimates that nearly 80% of the gang’s victims are a combination of organizations
from the US (58%), UK (8%), Australia (5%) and Canada (3%).
The faces of Sodinokibi are many, as it is the sort of malware that’s distributed by various
affiliates. In 2020, this ransomware’s originators showed off their success by depositing $1
million in Bitcoin into a Russian-speakers’ cyber crime forum as part of a recruitment drive for
more affiliates to join its ranks.

Sodinokibi: A Head-to-Head Battle With Manual Targeted Attacks
Once Sodinokibi focuses on a potential victim, the attack goes into a more sophisticated
operation by human actors who pave their way through the compromised networks to find
data, exfiltrate it and sow the seeds of the ransomware phase across as many devices as
possible. This is a major issue since it’s harder to detect a careful human who can change
tactics according to what’s happening on the defenders’ side.
That has not restricted the number of attacks by the group of Sodinokibi operators. The
number of publicized attacks is likely the tip of an iceberg. According to X-Force data from
2020, we estimate the total victim count to be around 250 organizations. Our most
conservative estimate places the total Sodinokibi ransom revenue at $123 million in 2020.
This estimate is the result of several factors, notably the big game hunting attacks. Of the
estimated 19 victim organizations with total annual revenue of $1 billion or more, at least 15
have probably paid a multi-million-dollar ransom.

The Price of Trust
According to IBM Security surveys and data collected on ransomware attacks, at least half of
organizations targeted with ransomware pay the ransom. That model might have worked in
some cases, in the past, when the only threat was locked files. But, a new question arises:
Are cyber criminals breaking their own business model by challenging organizations to trust
them with their stolen data?

5/12

With blended attacks that both steal and encrypt data, cyber criminals can add pressure to
their scheme and force organizations to pay or have their data exposed or auctioned off. But,
in reality, the minute a copy of confidential data is outside the organization, there is no telling
what’s actually being done with it. Is it truly being deleted? This is not a predicament any
organization would choose to be in. In some Sodinokibi cases, the attackers who were
supposed to delete the stolen data after they got paid ended up coming back for seconds,
demanding more money be paid because they kept the data.
This raises the espionage question once again. After the ransom is paid for the decryption
and supposed deletion of the stolen data, who’s to guarantee that the same data is not then
offered anonymously to a competitor? Who’s to say it won’t be offered to a rivaling nationstate for a hefty fee, all under the cloak of cryptocurrency payments and money-laundering
capacity that cyber crime gangs build by fostering relationships with other organized crime
groups?
There are no guarantees. A decryption key is one thing, buying trust is another. That’s why
this may seem like bad news at first sight, but it could be a factor that will make organizations
less inclined to pay ransoms.
With gangs like Sodinokibi thinking of expansion and attack diversity, security executives are
better off looking at security reinforcements and preventive measures (i.e., encrypting data
so it is useless if stolen, safely storing backups, threat intelligence-driven patch vulnerability
strategy, data loss prevention, continuous zero-trust improvements, etc.) rather than dumping
millions of dollars into a losing game — an attacker’s bottomless pocket.

It’s Sodinokibi — What’s Next?
When a ransomware attack is discovered, every second counts. As time passes, more data
and files are being encrypted, driving up the cost and damage of that attack. Immediate —
yet methodical and informed — action must be taken.
A first move should be involving IT security teams and allowing them to launch the incident
response process that they have prepared to combat ransomware. If you have a retainer
contract with a third-party provider, it is advisable to engage them now and get responders
on site. In the meantime, all defensive actions should count on the assumption that the
attacker is still in the environment and monitoring all communications.
If your team figures out which malware has encrypted data, typically by the encrypted file
extensions, run an initial root cause analysis (RCA) to determine how the malware got in.
While a formal RCA can wait until the post-incident activity phase, an abridged RCA will aid
the organization in entering the containment phase. Without a basic RCA, the infection cycle
is more likely to repeat itself. It is also important to perform the RCA before the recovery
phase, since an organization could expend a large amount of time and effort recovering files
only to see them re-encrypted shortly thereafter.
6/12

The pressure is on, the attackers make every possible threat at this point, and time is
running out quickly. If data has been stolen (e.g., customer data, financial data, cyber
insurance information, intellectual property, etc.) and the organization understands what’s at
stake, the company’s counsel, data privacy officer (DPO) or privacy officer should be
involved to plan the response that concerns customers and data subjects. Other parties to
consider contacting are federal law enforcement and regulators, depending on the local
requirements for the industry and geographies in which your company operates.
Fast forward to the recovery stage, as this is the point at which companies will typically
consider cutting their losses and may plan on paying the ransom or negotiating it down. It’s
important to consider the newer pressure tactics Sodinokibi operators use on top of
encryption, data exfiltration and DDoS, before paying. Moreover:
Paying a ransom does not guarantee recovery; some data may have been corrupted.
Paying a ransom does not equal instant recovery; it may take weeks or months to
decrypt data.
Paying a ransom can be a federal offense if paid to attackers in certain countries.
Paying organized cyber crime operations like Sodinokibi funds and strengthens their
business model.

Sodinokibi Expanding in 2021
Sodinokibi actors have been trying to recruit additional affiliates. One way to lure new
members to collaborate with them is by flaunting their wealth, by depositing $1 million in a
Russian-speaking underground forum, to assure members they can be trusted and those
who join will get paid.
The types of skills the group is after, and those which defenders will be seeing more of in
2021, appeared in a post in a dark web forum.
“Groups that have already got expertise and expertise in penetration testing, working with
MSF (aka MetaSploit Framework)/CS (aka Cobalt Strike)/Koadic (a Windows postexploitation framework and penetration testing tool), NAS/Tape (enterprise data archiving
and storage), Hyper-V, and analogues of the listed software programs…”
On top of these popular ransomware tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), check out
the annex at the end of this blog post for additional cues.
At this time, no end is in sight for Sodinokibi, but that does not mean it will not suddenly shut
down operations and disappear. In some cases, cyber criminals bow out of the arena when
they have amassed considerable wealth and are worried about potential law enforcement
crackdowns. We have seen such occurrences with GandCrab in 2019, Maze ransomware in
late 2020 and FonixCrypter in January 2021.

7/12

Until that happens with Sodinokibi — and with no reason to doubt that new actors will rise
next — defenders should continue to focus on security and employee awareness to limit the
potential for these types of attacks.

ANNEX
General Ransomware Characteristics to Look Out For
Ransomware attackers, including Sodinokibi actors, tend to be sophisticated, stealthy and
prevalent. Most times, they seek to gain access to a victim organization’s network by either
exploiting a vulnerability or acquiring and abusing valid account credentials.
Obtaining that initial set of account credentials typically comes through phishing attacks or
purchases in dark web cyber crime forums. Ultimately, once an attacker gains an initial
foothold, they seek to move laterally and acquire as many privileged account credentials as
possible. The use of some malware or penetration testing tools is a common practice.

9/12

Use of PuTTY Link (aka Plink) to tunnel RDP sessions and establish connections to
other devices on the network with randomized source and destination ports.
Creation of one or more user accounts and/or groups, group policies (GPOs).
Attempts to encrypt network shares; creates new tasks, registry keys
Attacker will target systems with V-sphere/ESXi/Nagios, NAS (data exfil), network
shares (data exfil), Exchange server (monitor and steal internal communications) and
consolidated backups (which can frustrate recovery efforts) especially during the
internal reconnaissance phase.
Internal network scans looking for IP ranges with the following services/ports:
10.0.0.0-10.0.255.255
HTTP and proxy (ports 80, 443, 3128, 8080)
FTP and SFTP (port 21, 115)
Database servers (ports 1433, 3050, 3306)
Remote management (ports 22, 23, 3389, and 4899)
Log deletion using publicly available code.
Lateral movement — many times, a primary subgoal is to move to a domain controller
(DC).
PSremoting session started; PowerShell downloads scripts and files; privileged
account used (i.e., Domain Admin); ADrecon executed (reconnaissance);
Scheduled Task executes script from SystemApps; lateral movement via Cobalt
SMB beacon.
Once on a DC, attackers attempt to disable Windows security settings like MS
firewall settings for all domain-joined computers via new GPO.
Deployment and detonation of ransomware on all domain-joined computers via
GPO.
Watch for any network activity to/from cloud storage platforms as a way by which data
is being exfiltrated.
