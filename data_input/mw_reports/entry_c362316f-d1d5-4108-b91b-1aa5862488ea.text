Appendix: Malware Used by APT37

On Feb. 2, 2018, we published a blog detailing the use of an Adobe Flash zero-day
vulnerability (CVE-2018-4878) by a suspected North Korean cyber espionage group
that we now track as APT37 (Reaper). Recent examination of this group’s activities by
FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence reveals APT37 has expanded its operations in both scope
and sophistication. APT37’s toolset, which includes access to zero-day vulnerabilities
and wiper malware, combined with heightened tensions in Northeast Asia and North
Korea’s penchant for norm breaking, means this group should be taken seriously.
We assess with high confidence that this activity is carried out on behalf of the North
Korean government given malware development artifacts and targeting that aligns
with North Korean state interests. FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence believes that APT37 is
aligned with the activity publicly reported as Scarcruft and Group123.

Targeting
and Mission
APT37 has likely been active since at least 2012
and focuses on targeting the public and private
sectors primarily in South Korea. In 2017, APT37
expanded its targeting beyond the Korean
peninsula to include Japan, Vietnam and the
Middle East, and to a wider range of industry
verticals, including chemicals, electronics,
manufacturing, aerospace, automotive and
healthcare entities (Fig. 1).

APT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR

We judge that APT37’s primary mission is
covert intelligence gathering in support of North
Korea’s strategic military, political and economic
interests. This is based on consistent targeting
of South Korean public and private entities and
social engineering. APT37’s recently expanded
targeting scope also appears to have direct
relevance to North Korea’s strategic interests.
From 2014 to 2017, APT37 targeting
concentrated primarily on the South Korean
government, military, defense industrial base,
and media sector. Lure materials (Fig. 2)
typically leveraged the Korean language and
featured themes such as Korean peninsula
reunification or sanctions.

APT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR

In 2017, APT37 targeted a Middle Eastern
company that entered into a joint venture
with the North Korean government to provide
telecommunications service to the country (read
on for a case study). At that time, other targets
included individuals involved in international
affairs and trade issues, the general director of a
Vietnamese international trading and transport
company, and possibly individuals working with
Olympics organizations assisting in securing
resources for athletes.
North Korean defector and human rights-related
targeting provides further evidence that APT37
conducts operations aligned with the interests of
North Korea.

APT37 targeted a research fellow, advisory
member, and journalist associated with different
North Korean human rights issues and strategic
organizations. It also targeted an entity in Japan
associated with the United Nations missions on
sanctions and human rights. APT37 distributed
SLOWDRIFT malware using a lure referencing
the Korea Global Forum against academic and
strategic institutions located in South Korea.
Notably, the email was sent from a compromised
South Korean institute that conducts studies on
North Korea. The string “durihana,” which is also
the name of a Christian missionary organization
that works with North Korean defectors, was
included in an APT37 weaponized document
sent to an individual who works with a North
Korean human rights organization.

Initial Infection Vectors
CASE STUDY:

Targeting of Middle
Eastern Organization
with Business ties to
North Korea

We believe a Middle Eastern organization
was targeted by APT37 because it had
been involved with a North Korean
company and a business deal went bad.
This firm was targeted shortly after media
reports of this schism had gone public. The
targeting effort may have been an attempt
by the North Korean government to gather
information on a former business partner.
The operation exemplifies APT37’s tactics,
techniques and procedures (TTPs), and
reflects the advanced capabilities of this
espionage group.

In May 2017, APT37 used a bank
liquidation letter as a spear phishing lure
against a board member of a Middle
Eastern financial company. The specially
crafted email included an attachment
containing exploit code for CVE-20170199, a vulnerability in Microsoft Office
that had been disclosed just a month
earlier. Once opened, the malicious
document communicated with a
compromised website, most likely to
surreptitiously download and install a
backdoor called SHUTTERSPEED (MD5:
7c2ebfc7960aac6f8d58b37e3f092a9c).
The tool would enable APT37 to collect
system information, take screenshots and
download additional malicious files to the
victim computer.

In addition to the aforementioned spear phishing tactics, APT37
leverages a variety of methods to deliver malware. These include
strategic web compromises typical of targeted cyber espionage
operations, as well as the use of torrent file-sharing sites to distribute
malware more indiscriminately.
Numerous campaigns have employed social engineering tactics
tailored specifically to desired targets. Lures and websites of particular
interest to South Korean organizations (e.g. reunification) are regularly
leveraged in campaigns. Multiple South Korean websites were abused
in strategic web compromises to deliver newer variants of KARAE
and POORAIM malware. Identified sites included South Korean
conservative media and a news site for North Korean refugees and
defectors. In one instance, APT37 weaponized a video downloader
application with KARAE malware that was indiscriminately distributed
to South Korean victims through torrent websites.

Figure 3. Timeline of CVE Release Dates vs. Dates of APT37 CVE Exploitation.

Exploited Vulnerabilities

Command and Control Infrastructure

APT37 frequently exploits vulnerabilities in Hangul
Word Processor (HWP) due to the software’s
prevalence in South Korea. Further, the group
recently demonstrated access to zero-day
vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-0802) and has the
flexibility to quickly incorporate recently publicized
vulnerabilities into spear phishing and strategic web
compromise operations. These capabilities suggest
a high operational tempo and specialized expertise.

APT37 uses a variety of techniques for command
and control. They leverage compromised servers,
messaging platforms and cloud service providers
to avoid detection. The group often relies on
compromised sites to host second stage malware
payloads. Over time, APT37 has changed the email
providers to set up command and control accounts
in a possible attempt to cover their tracks and cause
misdirection. These tactics have been refined over the
years as APT37 evolves to evade network defenders.

APT37 has repeatedly deployed exploits, especially
in Flash, quickly after vulnerabilities are initially
publicized (see Table 1). CVE-2016-4117, CVE2016-1019 and CVE-2015-3043 were all exploited
by APT37 in this way. FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence
confirmed that since at least November 2017, APT37

exploited a zero-day Adobe Flash vulnerability,
CVE-2018-4878, to distribute DOGCALL malware to
South Korean victims.
While use and discovery of zero-day exploits over
the past several years has expanded beyond a
nation-state dominated environment to include
commercial vendors of cyber espionage capabilities
and sophisticated financially motivated actors, access
to zero-day exploits remains a factor in distinguishing
sophisticated or well-resourced actors.
Figure 3 details the vulnerabilities exploited by
APT37, comparing the time of exploitation to the
time the CVE was released.

APT37 has used various legitimate platforms as
command and control for its malware tools. While
some early campaigns leveraged POORAIM, which
abused AOL Instant Messenger, newer activity
deploys DOGCALL, which uses cloud storage APIs
such as pCloud and Dropbox.

APT37 relies on compromised websites to host
second stage malware. Small websites focused
on subjects such as aromatherapy and scuba
diving have been leveraged, and were most likely
compromised opportunistically and made to host
malicious payloads.
APT37 has improved its operational security over
time. For example, early 2015 use of SLOWDRIFT
involved credentials associated with Korea related
mail servers such as “Daum.net”. Later, in 2015
and early 2016, APT37 pivoted to different email
providers such as Gmail and “hmamail.com” in an
attempt to anonymize activity. Then from mid-2016
onward, APT37 began using @yandex.com and @
india.com email accounts -- possibly an attempt to
cause misattribution.

APT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR

Malware
APT37 employs a diverse suite of malware for initial intrusion
and exfiltration. Their malware is characterized by a focus
on stealing information from victims, with many set up to
automatically exfiltrate data of interest. Figure 4 shows APT37’s
malware usage over time. A full breakdown of the malware we
associate with APT37, along with how it is detected by FireEye
devices, is available in the Appendix.

Along with custom malware used for espionage purposes,
APT37 also has access to destructive malware. In April 2017,
APT37 targeted South Korean military and government
organizations with the DOGCALL backdoor and RUHAPPY
wiper malware. Although the wiper capability was not
used in the identified instance, RUHAPPY can overwrite a
machine's Master Boot Record (MBR), causing the system to
fail to boot into preconfigured partitions.

It is possible that APT37’s distribution of KARAE malware
via torrent websites could assist in creating and maintaining
botnets for future distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)
attacks, or for other activity such as financially motivated
campaigns or disruptive operations. Disruptive and
destructive cyber threat activity, including the use of wiper
malware, public leaks of proprietary materials by false
hacktivist personas, DDoS attacks and electronic warfare
tactics such as GPS signal jamming is consistent with past
behavior by other North Korean actors.

SPECIAL REPORT

Attribution
We assess with high confidence that
APT37 acts in support of the North
Korean government and is primarily
based in North Korea. This assessment
is based on multiple factors, including
APT37’s targeting profile, insight into
the group’s malware development
and probable links to a North Korean
individual believed to be the developer
of several of APT37’s proprietary
malware families:

APT37 (REAPER): THE OVERLOOKED NORTH KOREAN ACTOR

• An individual we believe to be the
developer behind several APT37
malware payloads inadvertently
disclosed personal data showing that
the actor was operating from an IP
address and access point associated
with North Korea.
• The compilation times of APT37
malware is consistent with a developer
operating in the North Korea time
zone (UTC +8:30) and follows what is
believed to be a typical North Korean
workday (Fig. 5). The majority of
malware compilation times occurred
between 10:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m., with

a dip around noon. Additional activity
occurred late into the evening. This
is consistent with media reporting of
extremely long hours for North Korean
workers.
• The majority of APT37 activity
continues to target South Korea, North
Korean defectors, and organizations
and individuals involved in Korean
Peninsula reunification efforts. Similarly,
APT37 targeting of a Middle Eastern
company in 2017 is also consistent
with North Korean objectives given the
entity’s extensive relationships inside
North Korea.

North Korea has repeatedly demonstrated a
willingness to leverage its cyber capabilities for
a variety of purposes, undeterred by notional
redlines and international norms. Though they
have primarily tapped other tracked suspected
North Korean teams to carry out the most
aggressive actions, APT37 is an additional tool
available to the regime, perhaps even desirable for
its relative obscurity. We anticipate APT37 will be
leveraged more and more in previously unfamiliar
roles and regions, especially as pressure mounts
on their sponsor.

Frequency

The slow transformation of regional actors into
global threats is well established. Minor incidents
in Ukraine, the Middle East and South Korea have
heralded the threats, which are now impossible to
ignore. In some cases, the global economy connects
organizations to aggressive regional actors. In other
cases, a growing mandate draws the actor on to
the international stage. Ignored, these threats enjoy
the benefit of surprise, allowing them to extract
significant losses on their victims, many of whom
have never previously heard of the actor.
