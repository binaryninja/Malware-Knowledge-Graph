The American Dental Association (ADA) was hit by a weekend cyberattack, causing them to
shut down portions of their network while investigating the attack.
The ADA is a dentist and oral hygiene advocacy association providing training, workshops,
and courses to its 175,000 members.
For many living in the USA, you will likely recognize the ADA Accepted seal on oral hygiene
products, such as toothpaste and toothbrushes, indicating that the product is safe and
contributes to oral health.

ADA suffers a weekend cyberattack

1/5

On Friday, the ADA suffered a cyberattack that forced them to take affected systems offline,
which disrupted various online services, telephones, email, and webchat.
The ADA website now shows a banner stating that their website is experiencing technical
difficulties, and they are working on getting systems running again.

This outage is causing online services to be inaccessible, including the ADA Store, the ADA
Catalog, MyADA, Meeting Registration, Dues pages, ADA CE Online, the ADA
Credentialing Service, and the ADA Practice Transitions. The company has also resorted
to using Gmail addresses while its email systems are offline.
When BleepingComputer reached out to ADA for comment about the attack, we were told
that they were just suffering technical issues and were investigating the cause of the
disruption.
However, emails sent out to ADA members and seen by BleepingComputer paint a much
grimmer picture.
Last night, the ADA began emailing its members, including state dental associations,
practices, and organizations, with an update about the attack and information that can be
shared with the recipient's members.
"On Friday, the ADA fell victim to a cybersecurity incident that caused a disruption to certain
systems, including Aptify and ADA email, telephone and Web chat. Upon discovery, the
ADA immediately responded by taking affected systems offline and commenced an
investigation into the nature and scope of the disruption," reads an email sent to ADA
members and seen by BleepingComputer.
The email says that they are working with "third-party cybersecurity specialists" and law
enforcement to investigate the attack.
"Federal law enforcement has been notified and we are cooperating with them in this active
investigation, so we ask for your understanding that we must limit the amount of detail that
we can share at this time. In the meantime, we understand you may receive questions
about the incident from members," continues the email sent by ADA to its members.

"It is important that we provide members with accurate information regarding this incident. It
is equally important that we respond with accurate information while also being cognizant
that this is an active investigation."
The ADA's cyberattack is not only affecting their website, but also state dental associations,
such as those in New York, Virginia, and Florida, who rely on ADA's online services to
register an account or pay dues.

The ADA says that preliminary investigations do not indicate that member information or
other data has been compromised. However, the description of this attack sounds like a
ransomware attack, and almost every initial press statement says the same thing, with
stolen data later published by threat actors.
BleepingComputer has contacted the ADA with further questions about the attack but has
not heard back.

Black Basta ransomware gang leaks ADA's data
A new ransomware gang known as Black Basta has claimed responsibility for the attack on
the American Dental Association.
Soon after publishing this story, security researcher MalwareHunterTeam told
BleepingComputer that the threat actors had begun leaking data allegedly stolen during the
attack on ADA.

The data leak site claims to have leaked approximately 2.8 GB of data, which the threat
actors state is 30% of the data stolen in the attack.
This data includes W2 forms, NDAs, accounting spreadsheets, and information on ADA
members from screenshots shared on the data leak page.
The leaking of dentists' information can be particularly damaging, as small dental practices
typically do not have dedicated security or network admins.
This lack of dedicated IT personnel typically causes their networks to be less secure than
larger corporations with a significant security budget.
Due to the potential leak of ADA members' information to other threat actors, it is strongly
advised that all ADA members be on the lookout for targeted spear-phishing emails that
attempt to steal login credentials or other sensitive information.

Dental practices should also ensure they are not exposing any remote desktop services or
other potential avenues for initial access to their networks and should place them behind a
VPN instead.

ADA.
