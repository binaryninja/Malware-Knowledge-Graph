Treasury Sanctions Russian-Backed Actors Responsible
for Destabilization Activities in Ukraine

January 20, 2022
WASHINGTON – Today, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control
(OFAC) sanctioned four individuals engaged in Russian government-directed influence
activities to destabilize Ukraine. This is the latest action we have taken to target purveyors of
Russian disinformation, including designations in April 2021.
Today’s action is intended to target, undermine, and expose Russia’s ongoing destabilization
effort in Ukraine. This action is separate and distinct from the broad range of high impact
measures the United States and its Allies and partners are prepared to impose in order to
inflict significant costs on the Russian economy and financial system if it were to further
invade Ukraine.
The individuals designated today act at the direction of the Russian Federal Security Service
(FSB), an intelligence service sanctioned by the United States, and support Russia-directed
influence operations against the United States and its allies and partners. The four
individuals have played various roles in Russia’s global influence campaign to destabilize
sovereign countries in support of the Kremlin’s political objectives. The United States will
continue to take steps, through actions like this one, and in partnership with the Ukrainian
government, to identify, expose, and undercut Russia’s destabilization efforts.

“The United States is taking action to expose and counter Russia’s dangerous and
threatening campaign of influence and disinformation in Ukraine,” said Deputy Secretary of
the Treasury Wally Adeyemo. “We are committed to taking steps to hold Russia accountable
for their destabilizing actions.”
Russian intelligence services, including the FSB, recruit Ukrainian citizens in key positions to
gain access to sensitive information, threaten the sovereignty of Ukraine, and then leverage
these Ukrainian officials to create instability in advance of a potential Russian invasion. The
United States has worked closely with the Government of Ukraine to identify and expose
these actors to thwart Russia’s influence operations.
In 2020, Kremlin officials launched a comprehensive information operation plan designed in
part to degrade the ability of the Ukrainian state to function independently and without
Russian interference. This included identifying and co-opting pro-Russian individuals in
Ukraine and undermining prominent Ukrainians viewed as pro-Western, who would stand in
the way of Russian efforts to bring Ukraine within its control. Goals of the plan included
destabilizing the political situation in Ukraine and laying the groundwork for creating a new,
Russian-controlled government in Ukraine.
Russia’s influence campaigns are not only focused on Ukraine. For over a decade, Russia
has employed disinformation outlets and intelligence service affiliates to spread false
narratives in support of its strategic goals. Since at least 2016, Russian agents have even
sought to influence U.S. elections by spreading disinformation, sowing discord among U.S.
audiences, and falsely denigrating U.S. politicians and political parties.

FSB PAWNS IN UKRAINE CONTINUE DESTABILIZATION ACTIVITIES
Russia has directed its intelligence services to recruit current and former Ukrainian
government officials to prepare to take over the government of Ukraine and to control
Ukraine’s critical infrastructure with an occupying Russian force. At the heart of this effort are
Taras Kozak (Kozak) and Oleh Voloshyn (Voloshyn), two current Ukrainian Members of
Parliament from the party led by Victor Medvedchuk (Medvedchuk), who is already subject to
U.S. sanctions for his role in undermining Ukrainian sovereignty in 2014. Medvedchuk
maintains close ties with the Kremlin, and also took part in directing these activities.
Kozak, who controls several news channels in Ukraine, supported the FSB’s plan to
denigrate senior members of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s inner circle, falsely
accusing them of mismanagement of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, Kozak used his
news platforms to amplify false narratives around the 2020 U.S. elections first espoused by
U.S.-designated Andrii Leonidovych Derkach (Derkach). Kozak has attempted to legitimatize
Derkach’s claims by rebroadcasting Derkach’s false assertions about U.S. political
candidates. Throughout 2020, Kozak worked alongside FSB intelligence agents.

Voloshyn has worked with Russian actors to undermine Ukrainian government officials and
advocate on behalf of Russia. Voloshyn also worked with U.S.-designated Konstantin
Kilimnik, a Russian national with ties to Russian intelligence who was sanctioned for
attempts to influence the U.S. 2020 presidential election, to coordinate passing on
information to influence U.S. elections at the behest of Russia.
Kozak is being designated pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 14024 for being responsible
for or complicit in, or for having directly or indirectly engaged or attempted to engage in,
interference in a United States or other foreign government election, for or on behalf of, or for
the benefit of, directly or indirectly, the Government of the Russian Federation.
Voloshyn is being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for having acted or purported to act for
or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the Government of the Russian Federation.

FSB-CONNECTED FORMER UKRAINIAN OFFICIALS SUPPORTING RUSSIA
Volodymyr Oliynyk (Oliynyk) is a former Ukrainian official who fled Ukraine to seek refuge
in Russia. Oliynyk has a history of supporting Russia, currently resides in Moscow, Russia,
and shares Russia’s anti-Western sentiments. In 2021, Oliynyk worked at the direction of the
FSB to gather information about Ukrainian critical infrastructure.
As in previous Russian incursions into Ukraine, repeated cyber operations against Ukraine’s
critical infrastructure are part of Russia’s hybrid tactics to threaten Ukraine. The overall
strategy is designed to pull Ukraine into Russia’s orbit by thwarting Ukraine’s efforts at
Western integration, especially with the European Union (EU) and North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO). As Russia has pursued broad cyber operations against critical
infrastructure, it has focused on disrupting one critical infrastructure sector in particular:
Ukraine’s energy sector. Russia has also degraded Ukraine’s access to energy products in
the middle of winter. Acting through Russia’s state-owned gas company Gazprom, Russia
has repeatedly disrupted supplies to Ukraine—a vital transshipment country with pipelines to
other European countries—due to purported disputes over gas pricing.
Oliynyk is being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for having acted or purported to act for
or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the Government of the Russian Federation.
Vladimir Sivkovich (Sivkovich) is the former Deputy Secretary of the Ukrainian National
Security and Defense Council. In 2021, Sivkovich worked with a network of Russian
intelligence actors to carry out influence operations that attempted to build support for
Ukraine to officially cede Crimea to Russia in exchange for a drawdown of Russian-backed
forces in the Donbas, where separatists continue to receive support from Russia. In early
2020, Sivkovich coordinated with Russian intelligence services to promote Derkach’s
disinformation campaign against the U.S. 2020 presidential election. Sivkovich, who has ties
to the FSB, also supported an influence operation targeting the United States from 2019 to
2020.

or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the Government of the Russian Federation.
