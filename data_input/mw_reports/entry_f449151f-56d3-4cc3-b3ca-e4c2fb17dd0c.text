go report A+

A simple unpacking script for the Ezuri ELF Crypter. Based on the analysis done by Ofer
Caspi and Fernando Martinez of AT&T Alien Labs: https://cybersecurity.att.com/blogs/labsresearch/malware-using-new-ezuri-memory-loader

How does it work?
1/2

The payload is encrypted with AES CFB and will be decrypted and run via memfd_create by
the stub. Key and IV are stored in the binary.

Testing the script
1. Build the test payload gcc test.c -o test
2. Build and run guitmz/ezuri
3. To unpack it again: go run ezuri_unpack.go packed.bin
I also tested it with the packed Linux.Cephei sample mentioned in the report. Link to
Virustotal
