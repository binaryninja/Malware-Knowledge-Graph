Introduction
Advanced Persistent Threat group, APT28 (also known as Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm,
the Sednit Gang and Sofacy), is a highly skilled threat actor, best known for its
disruptive cyber activity against the US Democratic National Committee (DNC) and
the French channel TV5 Monde.
According to publicly available information, APT28 has previously used tools including
X-Tunnel, X-Agent and CompuTrace to penetrate target networks. These tools can be
used to hook into system drivers and access local passwords and the LDAP server.
Reported capabilities include monitoring keystrokes and mouse movements,
accessing webcams and USB drives, searching and replacing local files and
maintaining a persistent connection.
The signatures and Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) included in this advisory will
assist in detecting APT28 malware. Network based signatures alone will not guarantee
successful identification of APT28 in a network. Many of the communication modules
used by the actor are wrapped in protocols such as SSL/TLS, with the intention of
evading content-based signatures.
Please use the indicators in this NCSC advisory to check for the presence of this
malware on your platforms and networks.

Detecting known ATP28 tools
X-AGENT
X-AGENT (Also known as CHOPSTICK) is a second-stage modular remote access
trojan (RAT). It can run on Windows, iOS and Unix-based operating systems.
Functions of X-AGENT include key logging and file extraction. It is often used after
first stage malware such as CORESHELL or GAMEFISH. X-AGENT is likely to be
used in conjunction with XTUNNEL and CompuTrace/Lojack. Recent versions of XAGENT use SSL/TLS to encrypt the communications.

The following IP addresses and domains have been used for X-AGENT Command
and Control (C2) servers, to communicate with victims:

Snort Rules
The following snort rules can be used to detect X-Agent communications between
Command and Control (C2) servers and victims:

CompuTrace
CompuTrace/Lojack is a legitimate piece of software, which can track and assist in the
recovery of lost or stolen laptops as well as remotely locking and deleting files.
APT28 have modified this software. Exploitation of this software enables persistence
on the victim's operating system, as well as the ability to modify the system memory
and retrieve additional modules through the installed modified CompuTrace/Lojack
agent.

victims:
Please note: The Snort rule provided may detect false positives due to
CompuTrace/Lojack being legitimate software. The NCSC highly recommend

network administrators assess their environment for the presence of
CompuTrace/Lojack and adjust the signatures accordingly to exclude the legitimate
use of CompuTrace.

XTUNNEL
X-TUNNEL (XTUNNEL) is a network tunnelling tool that is used for network traversal
and pivoting. It provides a secure tunnel to an external command and control server,
through which the actors can operate using a variety of standard networking tools and
protocols to connect to internal services.

ZEBROCY
ZEBROCY is a tool used by APT28, which has been observed since late 2015. The
communications module used by ZEBROCY transmits using HTTP. The implant has
key logging and file exfiltration functionality and utilises a file collection capability that
identifies files with particular extensions.
The primary deployment mechanism for ZEBROCY has been spear-phishing emails,
in which the payload runs systeminfo, tasklist and also takes a screenshot.

Snort Rules
The following snort rule can be used to detect a string present in ZEBROCY victim
communications:

Mitigation
Follow the high-level security mitigations detailed in the NCSC mitigating malware
guidance (https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/mitigating-malware) and in the Preventing
Lateral Movement guidance (https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/preventing-lateralmovement).
For additional mitigations for Windows 10 follow the NCSC Windows 10 EUD
guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/eud-security-guidance-windows-10-1703.
This guidance details how to configure AppLocker to help prevent malicious applications
from running on end user devices.
Deploy SysMon. Microsoft SysInternals Tool SysMon, is able to monitor and log system
activity to the Windows Event Log. It can provide information about process creations,
network connections, and changes to file creation time.
By collecting the events it generates using Windows Event Collection or SIEM agents,
and subsequently analysing them, Network Defenders and System Administrators can
identify malicious or anomalous activity and understand how intruders and malware
operate on their networks.
To help reduce the risk of PowerShell being used as an attack vector on the
network, these two pieces of guidance will help:
• https://www.iad.gov/iad/library/ia-guidance/security-tips/powershell-security-risksand-defenses.cfm
• https://www.asd.gov.au/publications/protect/securing-powershell.htm
Manage macros carefully:
• Disable Office macros except in the specific apps where they are required
• Only enable macros for users that need them day-to-day
• Ensure these users understand how harmful macros can be, and treat macros
from untrusted sources with extreme caution
• Use a recent and fully patched version of Office.
• The underlying platform should, ideally, be configured in line with the NCSC’s
EUD Security Guidance. See NCSC Guidance:
https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/end-user-device-security and
https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/macro-security-microsoft-office
Layer phishing defences. Detect and quarantine as many malicious email attachments
and as much spam as possible, before they reach your end users. Multiple layers of
defence will greatly cut the chances of a compromise.
• Treat people as your first line of defence. Tell staff how to report suspected
phishing emails, and ensure they feel confident to do so. Investigate their reports

promptly and thoroughly. Never punish users for clicking phishing links or opening
attachments.
See NCSC Guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/phishing
Consider implementing a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
solution to centrally collate logs from SysMon and Windows Event Logs.
Set up a security monitoring capability so you are collecting the data that will be
needed to analyse network intrusions. See NCSC Guidance:
https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/introduction-logging-security-purposes
